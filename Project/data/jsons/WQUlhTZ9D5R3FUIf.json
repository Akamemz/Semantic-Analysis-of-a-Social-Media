    "content": "( CNN ) House Republicans revealed their new tax bill Thursday , but it 's already encountering some reservations from rank-and-file members .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan described the proposal , which lowers the number of tax brackets from seven to four and increases the standard deduction , as a series of tax cuts and breaks aimed at helping most Americans .\n`` It 's very clear and obvious that the whole purpose of this is a middle-class tax cut , '' Ryan said in an interview with CNN 's Phil Mattingly , shortly after the bill was made public . `` And more to the point , we need to get faster economic growth . ''\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said during Republicans ' news conference that the tax bill `` has President ( Donald ) Trump 's full support . ''\nThe President issued a statement applauding the bill 's release but added `` there is much work left to do . '' Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office that a tax reform bill will be done `` before Christmas , '' calling it `` one of the great Christmas presents . ''\nHowever , not all Republicans were happy . Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York tweeted that he planned to vote no on the bill in its current form , citing the proposal 's elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes , also known as SALT .\n`` I am a NO to House # TaxReform bill in its current form . A lot of good aspects , but its not there yet , '' he tweeted , linking to a longer statement\nAccording to the bill , individuals would still be able to deduct their local and state property taxes but only up to $ 10,000 .\nFor that reason , the legislation has struck a nerve with other New York and New Jersey Republicans . Brady already made a key concession when he said that he said he would still allow individuals to deduct their property taxes in the new bill . But that was n't enough for some who wanted to see the income deduction restored as well .\nThe bill , called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act , would permanently lower the corporate tax rate to 20 % and limit the home interest deduction to loans up to $ 500,000 . The bill would also increase the standard deduction for individuals and households , repeal the alternative minimum tax and increase the child tax credit to $ 1,600 . The House GOP bill would also repeal the estate tax in 2024 .\nAccording to another source in the GOP meeting , Brady started his tax presentation with a quote from Ronald Reagan , the last President to sign a massive tax reform bill .\n`` I feel like we just played the World Series of Tax Reform and the American people won , '' Brady said , quoting remarks Reagan made when signing his tax overhaul from the 1980s . Brady is a Texas Republican whose Houston Astros won the World Series just hours before .\nDespite the optimistic tone set by GOP leaders , there are still key questions about what will be in the bill and whether the leadership can wrangle the votes they will need to deliver President Donald Trump a major legislative victory by the end of the year .\nNow , the hard work begins of both selling the bill and keeping special interests at bay . Many lobbyists on K Street and outside groups admit the GOP lawmakers have kept a tight lid on the process . Once groups see what has been cut and what has been saved , winners and losers will be defined and the fight to preserve valuable tax breaks will begin . Over the weekend , one group , the National Association of Home Builders , already came out against the not-even-released bill .\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , a California Republican , notes he 's from a state with high state and local taxes and says lawmakers pushing for changes need to take a broader look at how the reform package will benefit their constituents .\n`` What 's happening is people are looking at this as one item instead of looking at everything we are doing , lowering the rate , doubling the standard deduction , '' McCarthy told CNN . `` You 're better off with this . ''\nIn advance of the bill 's release , some Republicans were already criticizing the details . On Thursday , Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that the $ 600 proposed child tax credit increase in the House 's tax reform plan was n't enough .\n`` House # TaxReform plan is only starting point.But $ 600 # ChildTaxCredit increase does n't achieve our & @ POTUS goal of helping working families , '' he wrote .\nDuring a conversation with reporters last Wednesday , Rubio said a $ 2,000 child tax credit was necessary to provide tangible relief to middle-class families . In 2015 , Rubio , joined by Republican Sen. Mike Lee , proposed a child tax credit worth $ 2,500 per child .\nRepublican leaders have argued that the party learned valuable lessons from the health care debate that crashed and burned in the Senate this summer .\nBut , already , the GOP encountered a setback Tuesday with deadlines when Brady announced that the bill 's release would be delayed by a single day . Some members also fear the GOP 's tax effort in the House has shared some frustrating parallels with Obamacare repeal .\nFor one , Republicans are spooked by the ambitious timeline that has been laid out by their leadership . Members are expecting to get a massive tax bill Thursday only to turn around and amend it in committee days later .\n`` We started differently on tax reform than we did health care , but I hope that we do n't end up back on the same tracks that led us to the debacle on health care , '' said Rep.
