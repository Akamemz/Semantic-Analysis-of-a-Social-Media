He hasn \u2019 t just witnessed them , he \u2019 s had a hand in influencing some of the defining features of the 20th century , including the rebottling of the nuclear genie and the demise of the Cold War .\nGeorge Shultz is calling on renewed American leadership to tackle today \u2019 s existential challenges : climate change , nuclear weapons proliferation , human migration , cyber threats to governance , and new disruptions to the global trading system .\nGeorge Shultz turns 100 this year \u2013 and like anyone reaching that age , he has lived through great historical moments . These range from the Great Depression , to the rise of fascism in Europe and World War II , to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union .\nBut much more than most , Mr. Shultz \u2013 one of only two people in U.S. history to have served in four Cabinet positions \u2013 has not just witnessed these moments . He had a hand in influencing some of the defining features of the 20th century , including the postwar reign of the dollar , the rebottling of the menacing nuclear genie , and the management and ultimate demise of the Cold War .\nPerhaps above all , he has taken part in the establishment and consolidation of the postwar American-led international order .\nSo when this centenarian declares in a quiet yet firm voice that the world stands at a turning point that will require every bit of the leadership and determination that got mankind through the 20th century , it seems wise to listen .\n\u201c We are now on a major hinge of history , comparable to but different from the hinge we were on at the end of World War II , \u201d says Mr. Shultz , who was secretary of state to President Ronald Reagan and treasury secretary , director of the Office of Management and Budget , and labor secretary to President Richard Nixon .\nHe \u2019 s seated at a modest , book-piled desk in his corner office at the Hoover Institution on the Stanford University campus .\nNow as then , he says , the world faces existential threats , and at both times the temptation to pull in and withdraw loomed large \u2013 a temptation the United States indeed succumbed to after World War I .\nBut not after the Second World War , given the devastation of the conflict , the millions of deaths , the Holocaust , and the advent of the nuclear bomb . \u201c [ Unlike ] after World War I when we withdrew from the world , they said , \u2018 We are part of it , whether we like it or not , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Shultz . Thanks to \u201c some gifted people , \u201d he adds , ticking off names like Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower , and diplomats George Marshall and William Clayton , American leadership guided the world out of the ruin into an era of growing security and prosperity .\n\u201c There were 44 countries at Bretton Woods , \u201d the 1944 conference that established a new international monetary system , he says , and \u201c out of that came basically the rules of the road on international economic arrangements. \u201d In quick succession came the Marshall Plan , the United Nations , and NATO , which successfully defended the West from the Soviet Union . The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , born at Bretton Woods , eventually \u201c got around to the World Trade Organization . \u201d\nOut of devastation , Mr. Shultz says , had come renewal and progress \u2013 in no small part because of inspired leadership .\nAs he talks , the art deco Hoover Tower , Stanford \u2019 s most imposing landmark , looms outside his window . Visible in the distance are Northern California \u2019 s signature oaks and redwoods , while somewhere a babbling fountain interrupts the campus hush . In the office , every space not taken by a book seems occupied by the memorabilia of decades of public service : signed photos of Ronald and Nancy Reagan , an autographed biography of Margaret Thatcher , Russian nesting dolls , a framed letter in which President Reagan thanks \u201c George \u201d for his service . A glass tray proclaims , \u201c WHY NOT HAVE A BIG LIFE ? \u201d\nYet Mr. Shultz , who just published a book , \u201c Thinking About the Future , \u201d is these days not so much dwelling on the past as considering how the glory years of American leadership might provide signposts for the challenges now on the world \u2019 s doorstep . Seven decades after World War II , he says , the world faces complex issues as real as and perhaps even more life-threatening than it did then .\nClimate change , nuclear weapons development and proliferation , human migration , cyber and social media challenges to governance , new means of production that disrupt the global trading system \u2013 all are going to test leadership capacity and human ingenuity to new limits , he says .\nIt \u2019 s perhaps not surprising that Mr. Shultz calls for renewed American leadership to take on today \u2019 s existential challenges with , as he puts it , determination and faith in progress , as well as respect for others \u2019 formative experiences and points of view . He is , after all , surrounded by many artifacts of the postwar American era and reminders of the role he played in it . He also thinks the U.S. is the only country that can help the world surmount these issues \u201c because I don \u2019 t see who else is going to lead . Not China or Russia . Europe can \u2019 t do it . \u201d\nALESSANDRA TARANTINO/AP/FILE In 2007 George Shultz joins Henry Kissinger and other statesmen to push for total nuclear disarmament .\nTo illustrate how others still look to the U.S. , Mr. Shultz tells the story of when Lee Kuan Yew , Singapore \u2019 s founding prime minister , visited him at Stanford with hopes of learning about the ingenuity of adjacent Silicon Valley .\n\u201c I reminded him that Silicon Valley is full of talent , the best and the brightest , from all over the world , not just from the U.S. , \u201d Mr. Shultz recalls . \u201c And he said , \u2018 Yes , but this could only happen in America . \u2019 \u201d\nYet if Mr. Shultz is issuing a clarion call for renewed American leadership at a critical moment in history , it is in part because he doesn \u2019 t see such a response now .\n\u201c Right now we \u2019 re not leading the world , \u201d he says . \u201c We \u2019 re withdrawing from it . \u201d\nThe four walls of the Shultz conference room at the Hoover Institution are chockablock with photos , magazine covers , yellowed political cartoons , tributes , and other remembrances of his career . Almost lost in the parade of frames is a photo of a smiling Secretary Shultz kicking up his heels with Ginger Rogers at a 1983 White House dinner .\n\u201c What a joy this was for me ! \u201d Ms. Rogers wrote in a handwritten note accompanying the photograph . \u201c For the first two minutes I could swear I was dancing with Fred ! \u201d\nNo doubt it says something about Mr. Shultz \u2019 s smooth-stepping skills to be compared to Fred Astaire , Ms. Rogers \u2019 longtime Hollywood dancing partner . ( Or perhaps erstwhile skills : Mr. Shultz confirms with a slight grin that his dancing days are \u201c no more . \u201d )\nBut what the Rogers anecdote underscores is the personal side of the lifelong diplomat . Mr. Shultz is a storyteller , and many of his tales highlight the importance he always saw in the \u201c softer \u201d side of diplomacy \u2013 the \u201c get to know you \u201d prebusiness conversations , the glitzy dinners , the visits to cultural and historical sites \u2013 as a sign of the common humanity and respect for the \u201c other side \u201d that can pay big dividends .\nTo illustrate this point , Mr. Shultz goes back to one of the first visits he made to Russia while secretary of the treasury . His counterpart took him to Leningrad ( today St. Petersburg ) with a first stop at the vast cemetery where many from the battle of Leningrad are buried . Standing with his host on a platform overlooking \u201c row after row after row of mass graves , \u201d the American treasury secretary noticed that all the Russians around him were weeping .\n\u201c And I said to [ my host ] , \u2018 I have a sense of community with these people because I also fought in World War II . I also had comrades shot down beside me . But furthermore these are the people who stopped Hitler. \u2019 And I walked up to the front of the platform and gave a long salute . \u201d\nYears later , when Mr. Shultz returned to Leningrad as secretary of state , \u201c I found that people knew about that little incident , \u201d he says . \u201c It teaches you that if you show respect to things that deserve it , then your criticisms of other things carry more weight instead of being just critical across the board . \u201d\nCOURTESY OF RONALD REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY George Shultz dances with Ginger Rogers at a 1983 White House dinner .\nEven well after his official years in government , Mr. Shultz has been called on to use some of his considerable personal skills to rescue a big foreign policy moment . He tells the story of being called by the State Department in 2013 with an SOS : China \u2019 s new president , Xi Jinping , wants to come with his wife a day before a scheduled summit with President Barack Obama at the Sunnylands estate in Southern California to get to know the area . Can the former secretary of state help out ?\n\u201c That \u2019 s a statement [ from President Xi ] that , \u2018 I want to get to know you , \u2019 have private communications where you get to know each other , and have confidence in each other , \u201d he says .\nMr. Shultz says he dispatched his wife , Charlotte Mailliard Shultz \u2013 who , he notes , as chief of protocol for both the city of San Francisco and the state of California \u201c knows a lot \u201d on the subject \u2013 to Orange County . And the experienced diplomat who had worked closely with both Chinese and Soviet authorities in his day says he was horrified to learn from his wife that \u201c no high federal official \u201d was set to greet the Xis upon their arrival .\nMs. Shultz called on then-California Gov . Jerry Brown , who agreed to welcome the Xis at the airport , and the two wives spent the day together while President Xi \u201c cooled his heels \u201d before Mr. Obama \u2019 s arrival , he says .\nThe Obama White House would later characterize the Sunnylands summit as a big success . But Mr. Shultz recalls that presummit arrival and says , \u201c This is not just a missed opportunity ; this is an insult . That \u2019 s not the way you get along with people . \u201d\nThese days Mr. Shultz may no longer be a practicing diplomat in the strict sense of the word , but he continues to write books , discuss economics with a group of Stanford and Bay Area academics , and keep a formidable social calendar .\nHe recently attended the annual dinner of Washington \u2019 s exclusive Alfalfa Club . His wife , at 86 , continues to carry out duties that make the couple a regular feature of the San Francisco Chronicle \u2019 s society page .\nMr. Shultz gives every indication of relishing the role of an \u00e9minence grise of U.S. foreign policy . He continues to pen Op-Ed pieces on issues such as arms control and climate change , often with another sage of his era , like former Secretary of State James Baker or Defense Secretary William Perry .\nHe says his large and close-knit family offers him a window on today \u2019 s young people . And he rejects the notion that young Americans today , while different from those of three or four generations past , are dismissive of institutions , less patriotic , or less oriented toward public service than his generation , which was called on to serve in World War II .\nDOUG MILLS/AP/FILE George Shultz receives the Medal of Freedom , the nation \u2019 s highest civilian honor , from President Reagan in 1989 .\nThe Shultz family glue and the patriarch \u2019 s understanding of the millennial generation \u2019 s values were tested a few years ago by the ignominious fall of the onetime Silicon Valley darling Theranos \u2013 the supposedly revolutionary blood-analysis startup . The company \u2019 s high-powered board of directors included Henry Kissinger , Sam Nunn , Mr. Perry \u2013 and Mr. Shultz .\nThe firm , now defunct , would be brought down in large part by an employee named Tyler Shultz \u2013 who saw from the inside that the company \u2019 s technology was not the revolution it claimed to be and took his findings public . He was a whistleblower who happened to be the grandson of Theranos board member and iconic statesman George Shultz .\nVersions vary as to how long it took for the elder Mr. Shultz to accept his grandson \u2019 s findings and to side with him in the Theranos affair . But the elder Shultz says he admires how his grandson never wavered and stuck by what he knew to be right .\n\u201c He has great integrity , \u201d he says of Tyler . \u201c What this [ Theranos experience ] tells me about my grandson is , he \u2019 s honest and he wants things to be good . It \u2019 s not that he doesn \u2019 t trust things , \u201d he says , bringing a question about millennials back to his grandson . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t put up with something that \u2019 s wrong . \u201d\nFor some , Mr. Shultz \u2019 s plea for American leadership to guide the world through the 21st century \u2019 s grave challenges may seem like an exercise in nostalgia , especially when it is coming from someone who had a role in a bygone golden era of American power .\nBut that tempting perspective would fail to consider that over much of his career on key issues of the day , Mr. Shultz has been ahead of his time \u2013 as a realist with a knack for seeing beyond conventional thinking to solutions that would end up becoming mainstream .\nThat has been true on climate change , nuclear disarmament , and , above all , the nation \u2019 s half-century-old drug war .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s just looking at the realities , an ability to see the realities , and using common sense , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s no big deal . \u201d\nAs far back as the Nixon administration , Mr. Shultz has advocated a drug policy that focuses on reducing demand instead of supply . He says the drug war has done nothing to address the market for narcotics while ravaging America \u2019 s southern neighbors .\n\u201c We complain about Mexico being a source of drugs , come on \u2013 we \u2019 re the culprits , not them , \u201d he says . \u201c They [ Mexicans ] are the victims ; they \u2019 ve had huge numbers of people killed by the drug lords \u201d supplying our market .\nBOB DAUGHERTY/AP/FILE George Shultz with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ( right ) in 1983 .\nHis solution is not drug legalization , he says , but decriminalization of possession of small amounts for personal use , ramped-up access to treatment , and education to stop people from using in the first place . ( He believes his friend Nancy Reagan was on the right track with her \u201c Just Say No \u201d campaign , but says then as now , in the devastating opioid epidemic , a \u201c huge drug bureaucracy \u201d has stood in the way of a demand-focused policy . )\nSimilarly on climate change , Mr. Shultz stands out as a lonely , though not lone , Republican voice who says the country is being \u201c mugged by reality \u201d and must act .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an ocean being created in the Arctic , why ? Why is the ice cap over Greenland becoming a river ? Australia , the whole continent is burning , why ? \u201d he says . Closer to home , he points to California \u2019 s intensifying fires and the repeated inundating storms in Houston over recent years and says , \u201c The Gulf of Mexico is the warmest it \u2019 s ever been . That means you \u2019 ve got a lot of evaporation , and what goes up must come down . So it \u2019 s not a mystery . \u201d\nFor years , Mr. Shultz has advocated what he calls a revenue-neutral carbon tax , which he says would cut fossil fuel consumption while encouraging renewable energy research and development , and job-creating innovation .\nAnd then there \u2019 s nuclear disarmament . President Reagan \u2019 s top diplomat notes that even in the 1980s his boss envisioned a world free of nuclear weapons , and he says that has been his goal ever since . It \u2019 s not dewy-eyed hopefulness that keeps him on the zero-nukes path but a realistic understanding of the unthinkable destruction , and indeed global annihilation , that nuclear weapons threaten . Calling it one of the \u201c hinge of history \u201d issues , Mr. Shultz notes that some nuclear powers , including the U.S. , are once again talking about scenarios for nuclear arms use .\nInstead of a focus on reduction , \u201c you have ... proliferation of [ nuclear ] weapons and a lot of careless talk about using them . People seem to have forgotten by now Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Cuban missile crisis , \u201d he says .\nHe \u2019 s critical of what he sees as the Trump administration \u2019 s willingness to allow decades of arms control success with the Russians be lost and reversed . He displays a rare public annoyance with the Republican administration over the current state of nuclear diplomacy .\n\u201c Right now the Russians have said they \u2019 re ready to renew [ the new START treaty ] and we \u2019 re hesitating . Come on ! We should grab that and then say to China , \u2018 Join with us and let \u2019 s see what we can do . ... You \u2019 ve got to be positive about these things , \u201d he says .\nAs he goes about his 100th year determined to continue being a \u201c doer \u201d on the world \u2019 s critical issues , Mr. Shultz is taking his own advice . He \u2019 s optimistic that the world will be up to the challenge of addressing this moment in history , and he holds out hope that America will again rise to the occasion and lead the way .\n\u201c This country has always produced the leadership we needed at critical times , \u201d he says , ticking off Washington and Lincoln , Franklin D. Roosevelt and Reagan . \u201c We seem to have a knack for identifying somebody . I don \u2019 t know who or what or whether or not somebody out there can stand up and be counted. \u201d Fortunately , he says , America continues to have values that motivate people to action and keep it , he believes , the envy of the world .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c We have community spirit . We have a culture that encourages people to look out for themselves , \u201d he says . \u201c We have outstanding institutions in many ways , and , by and large , there \u2019 s kind of an atmosphere of trust . I always felt trust is the coin of the realm . \u201d\nAnd here the hopeful realist in Mr. Shultz surfaces . \u201c Right now we \u2019 re pulling back [ from the world ] but we \u2019 re entwined , \u201d he says . \u201c There \u2019 s no withdrawing from the world ; we \u2019 re part of it . So we might as well see what we can do to make it better . \u201d",

And the experienced diplomat who had worked closely with both Chinese and Soviet authorities in his day says he was horrified to learn from his wife that \u201cno high federal official\u201d was set to greet the Xis upon their arrival.\n\nMs. Shultz called on then-California Gov. Jerry Brown, who agreed to welcome the Xis at the airport, and the two wives spent the day together while President Xi \u201ccooled his heels\u201d before Mr. Obama\u2019s arrival, he says.\n\nThe Obama White House would later characterize the Sunnylands summit as a big success. But Mr. Shultz recalls that presummit arrival and says, \u201cThis is not just a missed opportunity; this is an insult. That\u2019s not the way you get along with people.\u201d\n\nThese days Mr. Shultz may no longer be a practicing diplomat in the strict sense of the word, but he continues to write books, discuss economics with a group of Stanford and Bay Area academics, and keep a formidable social calendar.\n\nHe recently attended the annual dinner of Washington\u2019s exclusive Alfalfa Club. His wife, at 86, continues to carry out duties that make the couple a regular feature of the San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s society page.\n\nMr. Shultz gives every indication of relishing the role of an \u00e9minence grise of U.S. foreign policy. He continues to pen Op-Ed pieces on issues such as arms control and climate change, often with another sage of his era, like former Secretary of State James Baker or Defense Secretary William Perry.\n\nHe says his large and close-knit family offers him a window on today\u2019s young people. And he rejects the notion that young Americans today, while different from those of three or four generations past, are dismissive of institutions, less patriotic, or less oriented toward public service than his generation, which was called on to serve in World War II.\n\nDOUG MILLS/AP/FILE George Shultz receives the Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, from President Reagan in 1989.\n\nThe Shultz family glue and the patriarch\u2019s understanding of the millennial generation\u2019s values were tested a few years ago by the ignominious fall of the onetime Silicon Valley darling Theranos \u2013 the supposedly revolutionary blood-analysis startup. The company\u2019s high-powered board of directors included Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, Mr. Perry \u2013 and Mr. Shultz.\n\nThe firm, now defunct, would be brought down in large part by an employee named Tyler Shultz \u2013 who saw from the inside that the company\u2019s technology was not the revolution it claimed to be and took his findings public. He was a whistleblower who happened to be the grandson of Theranos board member and iconic statesman George Shultz.\n\nVersions vary as to how long it took for the elder Mr. Shultz to accept his grandson\u2019s findings and to side with him in the Theranos affair. But the elder Shultz says he admires how his grandson never wavered and stuck by what he knew to be right.\n\n\u201cHe has great integrity,\u201d he says of Tyler. \u201cWhat this [Theranos experience] tells me about my grandson is, he\u2019s honest and he wants things to be good. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t trust things,\u201d he says, bringing a question about millennials back to his grandson. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t put up with something that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nFor some, Mr. Shultz\u2019s plea for American leadership to guide the world through the 21st century\u2019s grave challenges may seem like an exercise in nostalgia, especially when it is coming from someone who had a role in a bygone golden era of American power.\n\nBut that tempting perspective would fail to consider that over much of his career on key issues of the day, Mr. Shultz has been ahead of his time \u2013 as a realist with a knack for seeing beyond conventional thinking to solutions that would end up becoming mainstream.\n\nThat has been true on climate change, nuclear disarmament, and, above all, the nation\u2019s half-century-old drug war.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just looking at the realities, an ability to see the realities, and using common sense,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nAs far back as the Nixon administration, Mr. Shultz has advocated a drug policy that focuses on reducing demand instead of supply. He says the drug war has done nothing to address the market for narcotics while ravaging America\u2019s southern neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe complain about Mexico being a source of drugs, come on \u2013 we\u2019re the culprits, not them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey [Mexicans] are the victims; they\u2019ve had huge numbers of people killed by the drug lords\u201d supplying our market.\n\nBOB DAUGHERTY/AP/FILE George Shultz with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir (right) in 1983.\n\nHis solution is not drug legalization, he says, but decriminalization of possession of small amounts for personal use, ramped-up access to treatment, and education to stop people from using in the first place. (He believes his friend Nancy Reagan was on the right track with her \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign, but says then as now, in the devastating opioid epidemic, a \u201chuge drug bureaucracy\u201d has stood in the way of a demand-focused policy.)\n\nSimilarly on climate change, Mr. Shultz stands out as a lonely, though not lone, Republican voice who says the country is being \u201cmugged by reality\u201d and must act.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ocean being created in the Arctic, why? Why is the ice cap over Greenland becoming a river? Australia, the whole continent is burning, why?\u201d he says. Closer to home, he points to California\u2019s intensifying fires and the repeated inundating storms in Houston over recent years and says, \u201cThe Gulf of Mexico is the warmest it\u2019s ever been. That means you\u2019ve got a lot of evaporation, and what goes up must come down. So it\u2019s not a mystery.\u201d\n\nFor years, Mr. Shultz has advocated what he calls a revenue-neutral carbon tax, which he says would cut fossil fuel consumption while encouraging renewable energy research and development, and job-creating innovation.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s nuclear disarmament. President Reagan\u2019s top diplomat notes that even in the 1980s his boss envisioned a world free of nuclear weapons, and he says that has been his goal ever since. It\u2019s not dewy-eyed hopefulness that keeps him on the zero-nukes path but a realistic understanding of the unthinkable destruction, and indeed global annihilation, that nuclear weapons threaten. Calling it one of the \u201chinge of history\u201d issues, Mr. Shultz notes that some nuclear powers, including the U.S., are once again talking about scenarios for nuclear arms use.\n\nInstead of a focus on reduction, \u201cyou have ... proliferation of [nuclear] weapons and a lot of careless talk about using them. People seem to have forgotten by now Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Cuban missile crisis,\u201d he says.\n\nHe\u2019s critical of what he sees as the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to allow decades of arms control success with the Russians be lost and reversed. He displays a rare public annoyance with the Republican administration over the current state of nuclear diplomacy.\n\n\u201cRight now the Russians have said they\u2019re ready to renew [the new START treaty] and we\u2019re hesitating. Come on! We should grab that and then say to China, \u2018Join with us and let\u2019s see what we can do. ... You\u2019ve got to be positive about these things,\u201d he says.\n\nAs he goes about his 100th year determined to continue being a \u201cdoer\u201d on the world\u2019s critical issues, Mr. Shultz is taking his own advice. He\u2019s optimistic that the world will be up to the challenge of addressing this moment in history, and he holds out hope that America will again rise to the occasion and lead the way.\n\n\u201cThis country has always produced the leadership we needed at critical times,\u201d he says, ticking off Washington and Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Reagan. \u201cWe seem to have a knack for identifying somebody. I don\u2019t know who or what or whether or not somebody out there can stand up and be counted.\u201d Fortunately, he says, America continues to have values that motivate people to action and keep it, he believes, the envy of the world.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

I always felt trust is the coin of the realm.\u201d\n\nAnd here the hopeful realist in Mr. Shultz surfaces. \u201cRight now we\u2019re pulling back [from the world] but we\u2019re entwined,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no withdrawing from the world; we\u2019re part of it. So we might as well see what we can do to make it better.\u201d",
