I really believe that . \u201d\nThe president and Mr. Kim plan to meet soon at a historic summit to discuss North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program . The date and location of the meeting will be announced within days , after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo nailed down more details in meetings in North Korea this week .\n\u201c Hopefully , everything is going to work out at the highest level , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c We want to thank Kim Jong-un who really was excellent to these three incredible people . \u201d\nAsked by a reporter how it feels to be home , one of the men , Kim Dong-chul , said through a translator , \u201c It \u2019 s like a dream . We are very , very happy . \u201d\n\u201c We were treated in many different ways , \u201d Mr. Kim said of his North Korean captors . \u201c For me , I had to do a lot of labor . But when I got sick , I was also treated by them . \u201d\nWhen a reporter asked Mr. Trump whether the return of the three men is his proudest achievement , the president replied , \u201c My proudest achievement will be \u2014 this is a part of it , but it will be when we denuclearize that entire peninsula . This is what people have been waiting for for a long time .

As the men entered into view , U.S. service members on the tarmac burst into applause and cheers .\nAfter Mr. Trump \u2019 s remarks , the three men boarded a bus for Walter Reed National Military Medical Center . The White House said earlier they would be evaluated and receive medical treatment at the Washington-area facility before being reunited with their families .\nMr. Pompeo had secured their release in Pyongyang after meeting with Mr. Kim on final plans for the summit .

Mr. Pompeo said the meeting would last one day and possibly a second .\nMr. Trump hailed Mr. Kim \u2019 s gesture as a sign of cooling tensions and growing opportunity on the Korean peninsula . Mr. Kim decided to grant amnesty to the three Americans at the \u201c official suggestion \u201d of the U.S. president , said North Korea \u2019 s official news agency , KCNA .\nNorth Korea had accused the three Korean-Americans of anti-state activities . Their arrests were widely seen as politically motivated and had compounded the dire state of relations over the isolated nation \u2019 s nuclear weapons .\nThe president also noted that he and Mr. Pence this week had called the family of Otto Warmbier , the Ohio college student who died in June 2017 after being released from North Korean captivity . He had suffered brain injury of an undetermined cause .\n\u201c I want to pay my warmest respects to the parents of Otto Warmbier , who was a great young man who who really suffered , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c His parents have become friends of ours .

His parents , Fred and Cindy Warmbier , have filed a wrongful death lawsuit , accusing the government of torturing and killing their son .\n\u201c We are happy for the hostages and their families , \u201d the Warmbiers said in a statement Wednesday . \u201c We miss Otto . \u201d\nMr. Trump praised Mr. Pompeo \u2019 s work and criticized The New York Times for a report this week that said the secretary of state was \u201c AWOL \u201d on the day that the president pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal . Mr. Pompeo was actually in North Korea on his mission to bring home the three Americans and complete the groundwork for the summit with Mr. Kim .\n\u201c I think our secretary of state , despite the fact that The New York Times said he was missing , he was in North Korea , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c But I think our secretary of state has done a fantastic job . \u201d\nThe president turned to Mr. Pompeo and asked , \u201c Mike , did you know that you were missing ? They couldn \u2019 t find him because he was in North Korea . \u201d\nMr. Trump entered office as an emboldened North Korea developed new generations of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles capable of hitting the continental U.S. Those advances were the subject of President Barack Obama \u2019 s starkest warning shortly before Mr. Trump took office , and this is a crisis he \u2019 s convinced his negotiating skills can resolve .\nSouth Korea , Japan and others have credited Mr. Trump \u2019 s \u201c maximum pressure \u201d campaign of sanctions for Mr. Kim \u2019 s willingness to come to the negotiating table .\nThe release capped a dramatic day of diplomacy in Pyongyang .

It was only after a North Korean emissary arrived a bit later to inform him that the release was confirmed .\nThe three were the latest in a series of Americans who have been detained by North Korea in recent years for seemingly small offenses and typically freed when senior U.S. officials or statesmen personally visited to bail them out .\nThe highly public and politically tinged arrival ceremony for the former prisoners organized by the White House was in stark contrast to the low-key and very private reception that the State Department had envisioned and carried out from the moment they took custody of them .\nDepartment officials took great pains on their release in North Korea , as well as on their flights to Japan and Alaska , to keep them sequestered not only from the two journalists traveling with Mr. Pompeo but also from staffers not immediately involved in their cases .
