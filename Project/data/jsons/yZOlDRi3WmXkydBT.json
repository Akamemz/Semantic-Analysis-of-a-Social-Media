    "content": "Many House conservatives backed the budget last month and spared GOP leaders another showdown with their right flank for one big reason : They were under the impression the spending blueprint would help them \u2014 finally \u2014 get an Obamacare repeal to the president \u2019 s desk .\nNow they \u2019 re concerned that Speaker John Boehner and company have other plans .\nConservatives are adamant that reconciliation \u2014 the rarely used fast-track procedure that allows the Senate to pass legislation with a simple majority rather than 60 votes \u2014 be used to pass a repeal of the health care law . They believed GOP leaders were on board .\nBut as House and Senate lawmakers have met to hash out a compromise budget over the past few weeks , conservatives noted that House Republican leaders have been talking about leaving their options open . An Obamacare repeal is a possibility , but so is a health care \u201c fix \u201d should the Supreme Court knock down some Obamacare tax credits in a case to be decided within a few months .\nThe ambiguity is causing consternation within the House Freedom Caucus , the few dozen conservatives who \u2019 ve repeatedly given Boehner grief over big-ticket items that have split the GOP . Some conservatives are pushing Republican leaders to clarify their intentions \u2014 with a public announcement , a provision in the budget or a private assurance .\n\u201c It \u2019 s imperative that [ Obamacare repeal ] be the focus for our reconciliation instructions , \u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) at a Heritage Foundation event last week , referring to the guidance the budget has to include in order to employ the procedure .\nHouse Republicans have already voted more than 50 times to try to defund , alter or overturn the health care law that conservatives despise . The latest effort , if it happens , would no doubt fail , too \u2014 and there are some indications that GOP leaders are ready to move on . But getting a bill to President Barack Obama \u2019 s desk and forcing him to veto it would send a powerful symbolic message to the Republican base that House conservatives haven \u2019 t given up on scuttling the law .\nThe topic took center stage during a recent caucus meeting . It also came up during a press luncheon last week with the most conservative House members . Rep. Bill Flores ( R-Texas ) , who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee , has been voicing concerns .\nNo one is threatening to bail on the budget , at least not yet , but conservatives \u2019 angst is palpable .\nJordan , who chairs the Freedom Caucus , was perhaps the linchpin of House leaders \u2019 success getting their budget across the finish line despite dissatisfaction from fiscal conservatives and defense hawks . Believing that reconciliation would later be used to approve a repeal of Obamacare , Jordan supported the winner-take-all strategy that allowed conservatives to register dissatisfaction with the spending numbers but back the budget when it reached the House floor .\n\u201c We told [ the voters ] time and time again , we are committed to getting rid of this law , \u201d Jordan said recently . \u201c So , let \u2019 s make sure we keep this thing front and center in the political debate , put it on the president \u2019 s desk [ and ] actually make him veto it . \u201d\nThe debate comes as House and Senate budget conferees prepare to announce a budget deal as early as Monday . A key sticking point in the negotiations has been over reconciliation : Senate budgeters want to use the process only for an Obamacare repeal . The House version gives reconciliation authority to more than a dozen committees , including many that have little or nothing to do with health care . That means , theoretically , they could try to find savings in the farm bill , transportation or an overhaul of the Tax Code .\nHouse leaders fought hard to keep their open-ended version , with leaders talking recently about \u201c flexibility \u201d to look beyond an Obamacare repeal .\n\u201c We haven \u2019 t gotten specific directions ; no one has come out and said we \u2019 re definitely going to do this , \u201d said Rep. John Fleming ( R-La . ) , a Freedom Caucus member . \u201c Whenever it \u2019 s discussed , it \u2019 s : \u2018 These are the various things we could put into [ reconciliation ] , \u2019 and the first one is always the repeal of Obamacare . But no one has ever come out , that I \u2019 m aware of , and said , point-blank , \u2018 Obamacare is going to be it . \u2019 \u201d\nA spokesman for Boehner ( R-Ohio ) said the party needs to focus on the bigger picture : Getting a budget passed .\nWithout an agreement , \u201c there is no possible way we can get a repeal of Obamacare to the president \u2019 s desk , \u201d said Michael Steel . \u201c That \u2019 s why we \u2019 re focused on reaching an agreement , and then passing it . \u201d\nOne of the key reasons Republican leaders have held back on committing to an Obamacare repeal is because they want to see how the Supreme Court rules in King v. Burwell , which seeks to invalidate tax subsidies obtained through federal exchanges . Millions of people now depend on those subsidies to afford health care under the law , and Republicans could be blamed if the high court strikes them down and the party doesn \u2019 t offer a replacement .\nSo GOP leaders are eyeing reconciliation as a way to approve a potential \u201c fix \u201d for Obamacare should the need arise . Some Republicans think it could give the GOP a golden opportunity to force Obama \u2019 s hand : When he finds himself in a jam , with millions stranded over health care , they hope he could be forced to accept a GOP alternative that helps those individuals .\nBut some conservatives want no part of what they view as an attempt to rescue the law .\n\u201c Save Obamacare ? \u201d an exasperated Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( R-Kan. ) said when asked his opinion of a King v. Burwell fix . The Freedom Caucus member voted against the House budget because of what he called a \u201c weak \u201d commitment to repealing the Affordable Care Act . \u201c I don \u2019 t know why we would save Obamacare . \u2026 I \u2019 m worried about stopping Obamacare . Fixing it ? \u201d\nRep. Mick Mulvaney ( R-S.C. ) said there will be a \u201c whole-scale uprising in the base \u201d if reconciliation isn \u2019 t used to repeal the Affordable Care Act . He echoed Huelskamp on the King case .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think King v. Burwell is the magic bullet , \u201d he said . \u201c The overwhelming majority of folks at the [ Freedom Caucus ] meeting \u2014 and we have 40 members \u2014 believe that Plan A has to be reconciliation to pass a repeal . \u201d\nRepublican Study Committee Chairman Bill Flores ( R-Texas ) said Republicans are split over what to do if the Supreme Court invalidates the health care subsidies . Some want to \u201c build a bridge \u201d for the nearly 8 million people who could lose their subsidies , giving them some sort of financial assistance to replace the health care tax credits until Republicans come up with a new health care law .\nOthers just want to pin it squarely on the White House and their adversaries on the left , who wrote the law and \u201c should own those laws , \u201d Flores said in an interview .\n\u201c There \u2019 s not a good consensus at this point , \u201d Flores said , adding that he \u2019 s not keen on replacing the subsidies .\nHe and Sen. Mike Lee ( R-Utah ) released a joint statement last week urging budget conferees to focus on repeal . They \u2019 re considering a \u201c Dear Colleagues \u201d letter to fellow Republicans to press their case .\n\u201c Though there are many important reforms to be addressed by Congress , reconciliation is a tool that works best when it is focused and precise , \u201d the statement read .
