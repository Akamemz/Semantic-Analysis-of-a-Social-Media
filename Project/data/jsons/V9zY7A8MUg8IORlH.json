''\nAnd yet Jimenez , who immigrated to the United States from Cuba when she was 8 years old , nearly 55 years ago , supports Obama 's new policy .\nSpeaking outside Caf\u00e9 Versailles , the famous Cuban eatery where exiles young and old gather for caf\u00e9 con leche , Jimenez called the U.S. embargo against Cuba a `` cane of support '' that Cuban President Raul Castro has been leaning on as an excuse for poor conditions in his country -- and now that the cane is gone , she 's hopeful he could tumble and fall .\nJimenez is emblematic of a broader shift within in the Cuban population in America , one that ultimately opened up the political space for Obama to start to change the U.S. stance toward the island nation .\nBut the same shift in attitudes that helped pave the way for Obama 's course change has also diluted some of the potency of what was once a clear political winner for Republicans . Fernand Amandi , a principal at Bendixen & Amandi International , which specializes in polling Cuban Americans , said what was once a reliable GOP base vote has now become more of a swing vote .\n`` Going into 2016 , the Cuban American vote in Florida will arguably be even more important than ever before , because now you 're going to see both sides , Republicans and Democrats , go after them in ways we have n't seen before , '' he said .\nIt 's a transformation that makes Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio 's intense opposition to the Cuba opening a potential obstacle in his presidential pitch to voters who share his background , rather than the surefire crowd-pleaser it has long been .\nThe senator leaned heavily on the story of his immigrant parents ' exile from Cuba in his presidential announcement on Monday , and he chose Miami 's Freedom Tower , which served as a landing hub for many Cuban exiles through the latter half of the 20th century , for the launch itself .\nThough the 43-year-old cast himself as a leader of the future , his focus on reasserting tough sanctions and freezing relations with Cuba is seen by many , especially younger Cuban Americans , as a policy of the past .\nAnd that was the gist of the attack launched by the Democratic National Committee when Rubio on Tuesday condemned Obama 's call for Cuba to be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list .\n`` For a guy who just yesterday said he wanted to be a new leader and usher in a new American century , it sure sounds like Marco Rubio is clinging to an outdated foreign policy relic from the Cold War , '' said DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee .\nDistance and time have transformed the Cuban American population , and in turn , its politics .\nSurveys suggest younger Cubans are more open to liberalizing trade and normalizing relations with the nation . A Florida International University poll in 2014 found that majorities of Miami-area Cuban Americans supported unrestricted travel to the nation , expanded trade opportunities and , broadly , stronger ties between the two countries .\nJUST WATCHED Obama asks Congress to move Cuba off terror list Replay More Videos ...

He described his family as split along generational lines , with his mother in favor of the move and his grandparents opposed `` because they feel like , that 's a strategy that the Cuban government is using to generate more money . ''\nBut Feliciano 's own view is that thawing relations is the right decision .\n`` I mean , Cuba has been stuck with this government for over 50 years now , and I feel like it 's time for something to change , '' he said Monday on his way to class on the sunny campus . `` The people deserve it . ''\nCarl Meacham , director of the Americas Program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies , said it was difficult to `` pin down '' the Cuban American population as a voting bloc because of the diverse opinions within it .\n`` They are much more split today on the way forward than they have ever been , '' he said . `` You have more Cuban Americans supporting a change to how the United States is supporting Cuba than you have in the past . ''\nBut it 's still a potent political issue for older Cuban Americans , which helps explain Rubio 's -- and the rest of the GOP field 's -- Cuba focus , as older voters remain a key portion of the GOP base .\nAn MSNBC/Telemundo/Marist poll out last week found a majority of Americans , spanning all age groups , approved of the move to reopen diplomatic ties with Cuba , but about a third of those older than 45 disapproved .\nAnd Meacham noted that the stance on Cuba plays into the broader GOP campaign against executive overreach from the President , with Republicans portraying it as yet another example of Obama acting without congressional approval .\nPart of the policy shift stems from Obama being a second-term president unconcerned with the politics of the issue -- and perhaps wanting to test his own theories of international engagement .\nThat 's what Jaime Suchlicki , director of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami and an opponent of the thaw , said was behind Obama 's move .\n`` He comes with a philosophy based on the idea that you make nice with your enemies and they become your friends , '' Suchlicki said . `` The President is doing this based on his own mindset , not on the reality of what is happening .

''\nPotential political backlash from the estimated 2 million Cuban Americans in the United States -- a huge portion of whom live in the key swing state of Florida , with a sizable enclave in heavily Democratic New Jersey -- has helped keep previous Democratic presidents from moving on promises to normalize relations .\nJUST WATCHED Obama-Castro meeting begins new era Replay More Videos ...
