We \u2019 re not going to do that , \u201d a donor in attendance recalled Podesta saying .\nHe told them that spokesman Brian Fallon had issued a very detailed response to the allegations in the book , and that negative stories and attacks were simply par for the course for the Clintons .\nFallon distributed an updated memo to the campaign \u2019 s surrogates and allies on Thursday , going a few steps further than his Tuesday night memo questioning Schweizer \u2019 s credibility .\nFallon \u2019 s new memo labels the book a \u201c forthcoming smear project. \u201d He writes that the primary conclusion to draw is that Schweizer \u2019 s book \u201c fails to produce a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as Secretary of State for the purposes of supporting the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation . \u201d\nThe Clinton campaign \u2019 s strategy to date has failed to stem the flood of negative media coverage .\nAccording to a report by The New York Times on Thursday , contributions flowed into the Clinton Foundation between 2009 and 2013 as a Russian atomic energy agency , Rosatom , took over Canadian-based Uranium One , which had far-reaching uranium holdings . That sale , according to the Times , gave the Russian company control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States .\nClinton \u2019 s State Department was one of the numerous U.S. government agencies that approved the deal , which was required since uranium production represents a national security asset .\nThe chairman of Uranium One made four donations to the Clinton Foundation through his family foundation , totaling $ 2.35 million . Those contributions were not publicly disclosed , according to the Times report , despite an agreement Clinton made with President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration to publicly disclose all donors and donations .\nFallon told the Times that no one \u201c has ever produced a shred of evidence supporting the theory that Hillary Clinton ever took action as secretary of state to support the interests of donors to the Clinton Foundation. \u201d The suggestion that the State Department \u201c exerted undue influence \u201d on the review of the sale \u201c is utterly baseless , \u201d he said .\nIn another example of the Clintons \u2019 money and transparency problem , Reuters reported Thursday that the Clinton family \u2019 s charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns because of errors in reporting donations from foreign governments .\nThe errors are on forms called 990 , which the IRS requires charity organizations to file every year to keep their tax-exempt status . Starting in 2010 , and continuing for three years , the Clinton Foundation \u2019 s report said that it did not receive any funds from foreign and U.S. governments , a stark contrast from reported donations in the previous years .\n\u201c We are prioritizing an external review to ensure the accuracy of the 990s from 2010 , 2011 and 2012 and expect to refile when the review is completed , \u201d a foundation spokesman told Reuters .\nThe foundation \u2019 s Clinton Health Access Initiative , or CHAI , is also refiling its form 990s for at least 2012 and 2013 , a spokeswoman said , according to the report . The program , which provides more affordable pharmaceuticals to HIV patients around the world , said its initial filings overreported government grants by more than $ 100 million .\nThe Washington Post \u2019 s Clinton headline focused on the companies and organizations that are major donors to the Clinton Foundation and have also paid former President Bill Clinton at least $ 26 million in speaking fees since he left office . It \u2019 s yet another indication of the close relationship between the Clintons \u2019 charity work and growing personal wealth .\nThe Post \u2019 s analysis found that four speeches by Bill Clinton were nowhere to be found on the former secretary of state \u2019 s disclosure forms .
