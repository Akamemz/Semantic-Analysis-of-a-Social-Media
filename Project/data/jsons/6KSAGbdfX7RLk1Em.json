The additions were necessary because the joint staff \u201cassumed responsibility for core missions\u201d previously done by the Joint Forces Command, which was created in 1999 to lead the post-Cold War transformation of the U.S. military, Dempsey said.\n\nStill, while the Pentagon is cutting combat forces, \u201cWe are not cutting the overhead proportionately,\u201d Punaro said. \u201cPeople have been trying to get at this issue in the Pentagon for 50 years. And frankly we haven\u2019t really put a dent in the overhead costs. It\u2019s not for the lack of trying.\u201d",
