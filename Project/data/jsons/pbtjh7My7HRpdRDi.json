    "content": "( CNN ) \u2013 Mitt Romney will seek to bolster his foreign policy credentials in a major speech Monday , two weeks before the GOP presidential nominee takes part in a presidential debate focused on security .\nIn his remarks , set to take place at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington , Romney will address the ongoing unrest in Syria , calling for the U.S. to `` work with our partners '' to help the opposition and `` ensure they obtain the arms they need . ''\n- Check out the CNN Electoral Map and Calculator and game out your own strategy for November .\nHe will further state , according to excerpts of his prepared remarks , a need to continue working `` no less vigorously with our international partners '' to support Syrians who stand against Iran .\nRomney will also argue that last month 's consulate attack in Benghazi , Libya , `` should not be seen as random acts . '' Instead he will say the violence `` was likely the work of the same forces that attacked our homeland on September 11th , 2001 . '' The Benghazi attack left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead .\nLast month , Romney sharply criticized the Obama administration 's handling of the situation and its immediate aftermath . Some political observers , however , hounded Romney for speaking too critically and too soon about the violence , before the facts were known .\nThe Republican candidate will also address issues concerning Afghanistan , Egypt and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Romney will focus on Iran in particular , warning that he will `` put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability . ''\nIn the third and final presidential debate on October 22 , Romney will face off against President Barack Obama on matters of foreign policy and national security .\nOf all the leaders who have called Lexington , Virginia their home , none is more distinguished than George Marshall\u2014the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense , who helped to vanquish fascism and then plan Europe \u2019 s rescue from despair . His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war .\nGeneral Marshall once said , \u201c The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it. \u201d Those words were true in his time\u2014and they still echo in ours .\nThe attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts . They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East\u2014a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century . And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself .\nThe attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th , 2012 was likely the work of the same forces that attacked our homeland on September 11th , 2001 . This latest assault can not be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam , despite the Administration \u2019 s attempts to convince us of that for so long . No , as the Administration has finally conceded , these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others , especially women and girls ; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today ; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West .\nI know the President hopes for a safer , freer , and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States . I share this hope . But hope is not a strategy . We can not support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds , when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut , when we have no trade agenda to speak of , and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership , but of passivity . \u2026\n\u2026 It is time to change course in the Middle East . \u2026\nI will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability . I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran , and will tighten the sanctions we currently have . I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf the region\u2014and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination . For the sake of peace , we must make clear to Iran through actions\u2014not just words\u2014that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated . \u2026\n\u2026 I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy , both in the Middle East and across the world . The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years . I will reverse that failure . I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise , expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones .\nI will support friends across the Middle East who share our values , but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies .\nIn Libya , I will support the Libyan people \u2019 s efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them , and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans .\nIn Egypt , I will use our influence\u2014including clear conditions on our aid\u2014to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians , to build democratic institutions , and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel . And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid .\nIn Syria , I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad \u2019 s tanks , helicopters , and fighter jets . Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them . We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran\u2014rather than sitting on the sidelines . It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East .\nAnd in Afghanistan , I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014 . President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war . But the route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11 . I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders . And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects , but to the security of the nation .\nFinally , I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic , prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel . On this vital issue , the President has failed , and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations . In this old conflict , as in every challenge we face in the Middle East , only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew .\nI believe that if America does not lead , others will\u2014others who do not share our interests and our values\u2014and the world will grow darker , for our friends and for us . America \u2019 s security and the cause of freedom can not afford four more years like the last four years . I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty , to our citizens , and to our friends everywhere , to use America \u2019 s great influence\u2014wisely , with solemnity and without false pride , but also firmly and actively\u2014to shape events in ways that secure our interests , further our values , prevent conflict , and make the world better\u2014not perfect , but better .\nSir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall : \u201c He \u2026 always fought victoriously against defeatism , discouragement , and disillusion. \u201d That is the role our friends want America to play again . And it is the role we must play .\nThe 21st century can and must be an American century . It began with terror , war , and economic calamity . It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom , peace , and prosperity .",
