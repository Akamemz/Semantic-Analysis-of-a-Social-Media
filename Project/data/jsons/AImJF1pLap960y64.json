    "content": "Judge Les Hayes once sentenced a single mother to 496 days behind bars for failing to pay traffic tickets . The sentence was so stiff it exceeded the jail time Alabama allows for negligent homicide .\nMarquita Johnson , who was locked up in April 2012 , says the impact of her time in jail endures today . Johnson \u2019 s three children were cast into foster care while she was incarcerated . One daughter was molested , state records show . Another was physically abused .\n\u201c Judge Hayes took away my life and didn \u2019 t care how my children suffered , \u201d said Johnson , now 36 . \u201c My girls will never be the same . \u201d\nFellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe . \u201c They had a nickname for me : The Woman with All the Days , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c That \u2019 s what they called me : The Woman with All the Days . There were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me . \u201d\nIn 2016 , the state agency that oversees judges charged Hayes with violating Alabama \u2019 s code of judicial conduct . According to the Judicial Inquiry Commission , Hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing Johnson and hundreds of other Montgomery residents too poor to pay fines . Among those jailed : a plumber struggling to make rent , a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son , and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college .\nHayes , a judge since 2000 , admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state \u2019 s judicial conduct code . One of the counts was a breach of a judge \u2019 s most essential duty : failing to \u201c respect and comply with the law . \u201d\nDespite the severity of the ruling , Hayes wasn \u2019 t barred from serving as a judge . Instead , the judicial commission and Hayes reached a deal . The former Eagle Scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension . Then he could return to the bench .\nUntil he was disciplined , Hayes said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c I never thought I was doing something wrong . \u201d\nThis week , Hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge . In a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Hayes said he was \u201c very remorseful \u201d for his misdeeds .\nCommunity activists say his departure is long overdue . Yet the decision to leave , they say , should never have been his to make , given his record of misconduct .\n\u201c He should have been fired years ago , \u201d said Willie Knight , pastor of North Montgomery Baptist Church . \u201c He broke the law and wanted to get away with it . His sudden retirement is years too late . \u201d\nHayes is among thousands of state and local judges across America who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold , a \u2588\u2588\u2588 investigation found .\nJudges have made racist statements , lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer \u2013 and then returned to the bench , sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct .\nRecent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in South Carolina , Louisiana and Illinois . \u2588\u2588\u2588 went further .\nIn the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years \u2013 2008 through 2019 \u2013 in which judges resigned , retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct . In addition , reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses \u2013 including the identities of the judges themselves .\nAll told , 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct , \u2588\u2588\u2588 determined . They included a California judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers , once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney ; a New York judge who berated domestic violence victims ; and a Maryland judge who , after his arrest for driving drunk , was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a Breathalyzer test before each appearance .\nThe news agency \u2019 s findings reveal an \u201c excessively \u201d forgiving judicial disciplinary system , said Stephen Gillers , a law professor at New York University who writes about judicial ethics . Although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases , Gillers said , the public \u201c would be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get \u201d for substantial transgressions .\nIn Utah , a judge texted a video of a man \u2019 s scrotum to court clerks . He was reprimanded but remains on the bench .\nIn Indiana , three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a White Castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot . Although the state supreme court found the three judges had \u201c discredited the entire Indiana judiciary , \u201d each returned to the bench after a suspension .\nIn Texas , a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that God told him the defendant was innocent . The offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench . The defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case .\n\u201c There are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance , \u201d the jury foreman , Mark House , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The judge should have been fined , House said , and kicked off the bench . \u201c There is no justice , because he is still doing his job . \u201d\nJudicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in America \u2019 s courts and , absent tough consequences , could give judges license to behave with impunity .\n\u201c When you see cases like that , the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system , \u201d said Steve Scheckman , a lawyer who directed Louisiana \u2019 s oversight agency and served as deputy director of New York \u2019 s . \u201c It looks like a good ol \u2019 boys club . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime Alabama judge who concurrently served on the state \u2019 s judicial oversight commission . The judge , Cullman District Court \u2019 s Kim Chaney , remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission . In at least 200 cases , court records show , Judge Chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent , enabling the younger Chaney to earn at least $ 105,000 in fees over two years .\nIn February , months after \u2588\u2588\u2588 repeatedly asked Chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases , he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation .\nTommy Drake , the lawyer who first filed a complaint against Chaney in 2016 , said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if \u2588\u2588\u2588 hadn \u2019 t examined the case .\n\u201c You know the only reason they did anything about Chaney is because you guys started asking questions , \u201d Drake said . \u201c Otherwise , he \u2019 d still be there . \u201d\nState and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the American criminal justice system , touching the lives of millions of people every year .\nThe country \u2019 s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually . The nearly 30,000 state , county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket : more than 100 million new cases each year , from traffic to divorce to murder . Their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice . Their powers are vast and varied \u2013 from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child .\nEach U.S. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges . The authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts , which can reverse a judge \u2019 s legal ruling and order a new trial . Judicial commissions can not change verdicts . Rather , they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal .\nFew experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly , respecting the law and those who appear before them . And some contend that , when judges do falter , oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior . \u201c With a few notable exceptions , the commissions generally get it right , \u201d said Keith Swisher , a University of Arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics .\nOthers disagree . They note that the clout of these commissions is limited , and their authority differs from state to state . To remove a judge , all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges . And most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers .\nAs a result , the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it : people like Marquita Johnson .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 scoured thousands of state investigative files , disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct . The examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge \u2019 s misconduct . The victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist , sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases .\nThe number is a conservative estimate . The tally doesn \u2019 t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct .\n\u201c If we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims , then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about . \u201d\nIn Pennsylvania , the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges . The judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center . In 2009 , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed senior judge Arthur Grim to lead a victim review , and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles . Grim told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct .\n\u201c If we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims , then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about , \u201d Grim said .\nIn another review underway in Ohio , state public defender Tim Young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism . Mike Benza , a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose students are helping identify victims , compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power . \u201c You see one case and then you look to see if it 's systemic , \u201d he said .\nThe review , which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic , may take a year . But Young said the time-consuming task is essential because \u201c a fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people . \u201d\nMost states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice . Perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of America \u2019 s system for overseeing judges than Alabama .\nAs in most states , Alabama \u2019 s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission is a mix of lawyers , judges and laypeople . All are appointed . Their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation .\nAlabama \u2019 s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult . The complaint must be notarized , which means that in theory , anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury . Complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing ; those that arrive by phone , email or without a notary stamp are not investigated , although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected . Anonymous written complaints are shredded .\nThese rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation , commission director Jenny Garrett noted in response to written questions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint , \u201d said Sue Bell Cobb , chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2007 to 2011 . In 2009 , she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an American Bar Association report that offered a scathing review of Alabama 's rules .\nIn most other states , commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email , even anonymous ones , or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing . In Alabama , staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself , which convenes about every seven weeks .\nBy rule , the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation . If a subpoena is issued , the judge receives a simultaneous copy , raising fears about witness intimidation . If a witness gives investigators a statement , the judge receives a transcript . In the U.S. justice system , such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint . \u201d\n\u201c Why the need for special rules for judges ? \u201d said Michael Levy , a Washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal , corporate , congressional and securities investigations . \u201c If judges think it \u2019 s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas , why don \u2019 t judges think it \u2019 s fair to investigate judges in the same way ? \u201d\nAlabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially . \u2588\u2588\u2588 interviews and a review of Alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective \u201c guidance. \u201d The identities of those judges remain confidential , as does the conduct that prompted the meetings . \u201c Not every violation warrants discipline , \u201d commission director Garrett said .\nSince 2008 , the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges , including Hayes , charging two this year .\nTwo of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved Roy Moore , who was twice forced out as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders .\nAnother Alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint , however . Tom Parker , first elected to the state \u2019 s high court in 2004 , pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision legalizing gay marriage .\nParker sued the commission in federal court , arguing the agency was infringing on his First Amendment rights . He won . Although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling , it was ordered to cover Parker \u2019 s legal fees : $ 100,000 , or about a fifth of the agency \u2019 s total annual budget .\nIn 2018 , the people of Alabama elected Parker chief justice .\nThese days , Parker told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy \u201c a much better relationship \u201d that \u2019 s less politically tinged . \u201c How can I say it ? It \u2019 s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now . \u201d\nMontgomery , Alabama has a deep history of racial conflict , as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city \u2019 s great seal : \u201c Cradle of the Confederacy \u201d and \u201c Birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement . \u201d\nJefferson Davis was inaugurated here as Confederate president after the South seceded from the Union in 1861 , and his birthday is a state holiday . As was common throughout the South , the city was the site of the lynchings of Black men , crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here . Police arrested civil rights icon Rosa Parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger .\nToday , about 60 % of Montgomery \u2019 s 198,000 residents are Black , U.S. census records show . Even so , Black motorists account for about 90 % of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets , a \u2588\u2588\u2588 examination of court records found . Much of Judge Hayes \u2019 work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines . Hayes , who is white , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c the majority of people who come before the court are Black . \u201d\nCity officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants , no matter how minor the offense .\nIn April 2012 , Marquita Johnson was among them . Appearing before Hayes on a Wednesday morning , the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break .\nJohnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance . She had insurance , she said . But when she was pulled over , she couldn \u2019 t find the card to prove it .\nEven a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary . In addition to fines , the court assessed a $ 155 fee to every ticket . Court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop \u2013 a practice some residents call \u201c stacking . \u201d\nUnder state law , failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver \u2019 s license . Johnson \u2019 s decision to keep driving nonetheless \u2013 taking her children to school or to doctor visits , getting groceries , going to work \u2013 led to more tickets and deeper debt .\n\u201c I told Judge Hayes that I had lost my job and needed more time to pay , \u201d she recounted .\nBy Hayes \u2019 calculation , Johnson owed more than $ 12,000 in fines . He sentenced Johnson to 496 days in jail . Hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $ 25 toward the outstanding debt . A different judge later determined that Johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by Hayes , and that Hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid . To shave time off her sentence , Johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed .\nHayes told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe . \u201c With my years of experience , I can tell when someone is being truthful with me , \u201d Hayes said . He called it \u201c gut instinct \u201d -- though he added , in a statement this week , that he also consulted \u201c each defendant 's criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court . \u201d\nOf course , the law demands more of a judge than a gut call . In a 1983 landmark decision , Bearden v. Georgia , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has \u201c willfully \u201d chosen not to pay a fine .\nAccording to the state \u2019 s judicial oversight commission , \u201c Judge Hayes did not make any inquiry into Ms. Johnson \u2019 s ability to pay , whether her non-payment was willful . \u201d\nFrom jail , \u201c I prayed to return to my daughters , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c I was sure that someone would realize that Hayes had made a mistake . \u201d\nShe said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter \u2019 s 3rd birthday . From a jail telephone , she tried to sing \u201c Happy Birthday \u201d but slumped to the floor in grief .\n\u201c She was choking up and crying , \u201d said Johnson \u2019 s mother , Blanche , who was on the call . \u201c She was devastated to be away from her children so long . \u201d\nWhen Johnson was freed after 10 months in jail , she learned that strangers had abused her two older children . One is now a teenager ; the other is in middle school . \u201c My kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c My daughters get frantic when I leave the house . I know they \u2019 ve had nightmares that I \u2019 m going to disappear again . \u201d\nSix months after Johnson \u2019 s release , Hayes jailed another single Black mother . Angela McCullough , then 40 , had been pulled over driving home from Faulkner University , a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average . As a mother of four children , including a disabled adult son , she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor .\nPolice ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights . After a background check , the officer arrested McCullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets . She was later brought before Hayes .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t go to jail , \u201d McCullough recalled pleading with the judge . \u201c I \u2019 m a mother . I have a disabled son who needs me . \u201d\nHayes sentenced McCullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $ 1,350 , court records show . Her adult son , diagnosed with schizophrenia , was held in an institution until her release .\nMcCullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence . One day , she recalled , she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists .\nShe was freed after 20 days , using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets , she said .\nJail was the darkest chapter of her life , McCullough said , a place where \u201c the devil was trying to take my mind. \u201d Today , she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree . \u201c I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ll ever be able to afford to go back . \u201d\nA clear sign that something was amiss in Montgomery courts came in November 2013 , when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor . A similar suit was filed in 2014 , and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015 . Johnson and McCullough were plaintiffs .\nThe lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in Ferguson , Missouri , after a white police officer killed a Black teenager in 2014 . In a scathing report on the origins of the unrest , the U.S. Department of Justice exposed how Ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines , a practice that fell disproportionately hard on Black residents .\n\u201c Montgomery is just like Ferguson , \u201d said Karen Jones , a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit . Jones has led recent protests in Montgomery in the wake of the killing of George Floyd , the Black man whose death under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice .\nIn Montgomery , \u201c everybody knew that the police targeted Black residents . And I sat in Hayes \u2019 court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money , then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city . \u201d\nIt was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against Hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission . The oversight agency opened its Hayes case in summer 2015 , nearly two years after plaintiffs \u2019 lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body . Hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension .\nUnder its own rules , the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate Hayes at any time . Commission director Garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn \u2019 t investigate sooner . The investigation went slowly , Garrett said , because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records . The commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017 , Garrett said , issuing charges against five judges , including Moore .\nA few months after Judge Hayes \u2019 suspension ended , his term as a municipal judge was set to expire . So , the Montgomery City Council took up the question of the judge \u2019 s future on March 6 , 2018 . On the agenda of its meeting : whether to reappoint Hayes to another four-year term .\nHayes wasn \u2019 t in the audience that night , but powerful supporters were . The city \u2019 s chief judge , Milton Westry , told the council that Hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants , \u201c since we learned a better way of doing things. \u201d In the wake of the suits , Westry said , Hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines .\nAs part of a settlement in the civil case , the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years . Those reforms have since been abandoned , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found . Both measures were deemed too expensive , Hayes and city officials confirmed .\nResidents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing Hayes . Jones , the community activist , reminded council members that Hayes had \u201c pleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold . \u201d\nThe city council voted to rehire Hayes to a fifth consecutive term .\nMarquita Johnson said she can \u2019 t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed .\n\u201c Hiring Hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c It was a message that we do n't matter . \u201d\nOn Thursday , Hayes will retire from the bench . In an earlier interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , he declined to discuss the Johnson case . Asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out , he paused .\n\u201c I think , maybe , I could have been more sympathetic at times , \u201d Hayes said . \u201c Sometimes you miss a few . \u201d\nAdditional reporting by Isabella Jibilian , Andrea Januta and Blake Morrison .

    "content_original": "Judge Les Hayes once sentenced a single mother to 496 days behind bars for failing to pay traffic tickets. The sentence was so stiff it exceeded the jail time Alabama allows for negligent homicide.\n\nMarquita Johnson, who was locked up in April 2012, says the impact of her time in jail endures today. Johnson\u2019s three children were cast into foster care while she was incarcerated. One daughter was molested, state records show. Another was physically abused.\n\n\u201cJudge Hayes took away my life and didn\u2019t care how my children suffered,\u201d said Johnson, now 36. \u201cMy girls will never be the same.\u201d\n\nFellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe. \u201cThey had a nickname for me: The Woman with All the Days,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they called me: The Woman with All the Days. There were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the state agency that oversees judges charged Hayes with violating Alabama\u2019s code of judicial conduct. According to the Judicial Inquiry Commission, Hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing Johnson and hundreds of other Montgomery residents too poor to pay fines. Among those jailed: a plumber struggling to make rent, a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son, and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college.\n\nHayes, a judge since 2000, admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state\u2019s judicial conduct code. One of the counts was a breach of a judge\u2019s most essential duty: failing to \u201crespect and comply with the law.\u201d\n\nDespite the severity of the ruling, Hayes wasn\u2019t barred from serving as a judge. Instead, the judicial commission and Hayes reached a deal. The former Eagle Scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension. Then he could return to the bench.\n\nUntil he was disciplined, Hayes said in an interview with Reuters, \u201cI never thought I was doing something wrong.\u201d\n\nThis week, Hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge. In a statement to Reuters, Hayes said he was \u201cvery remorseful\u201d for his misdeeds.\n\nCommunity activists say his departure is long overdue. Yet the decision to leave, they say, should never have been his to make, given his record of misconduct.\n\n\u201cHe should have been fired years ago,\u201d said Willie Knight, pastor of North Montgomery Baptist Church. \u201cHe broke the law and wanted to get away with it. His sudden retirement is years too late.\u201d\n\nHayes is among thousands of state and local judges across America who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold, a Reuters investigation found.\n\nRelated content Methodology and Q&A: How we examined misconduct\n\nJudges have made racist statements, lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer \u2013 and then returned to the bench, sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct.\n\nRecent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in South Carolina, Louisiana and Illinois. Reuters went further.\n\nIn the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally, Reuters reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years \u2013 2008 through 2019 \u2013 in which judges resigned, retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct. In addition, reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses \u2013 including the identities of the judges themselves.\n\nAll told, 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct, Reuters determined. They included a California judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers, once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney; a New York judge who berated domestic violence victims; and a Maryland judge who, after his arrest for driving drunk, was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a Breathalyzer test before each appearance.\n\nThe news agency\u2019s findings reveal an \u201cexcessively\u201d forgiving judicial disciplinary system, said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who writes about judicial ethics. Although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases, Gillers said, the public \u201cwould be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get\u201d for substantial transgressions.\n\nAmong the cases from the past year alone:\n\nIn Utah, a judge texted a video of a man\u2019s scrotum to court clerks. He was reprimanded but remains on the bench.\n\nIn Indiana, three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a White Castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot. Although the state supreme court found the three judges had \u201cdiscredited the entire Indiana judiciary,\u201d each returned to the bench after a suspension.\n\nIn Texas, a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that God told him the defendant was innocent. The offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench. The defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case.\n\n\u201cThere are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance,\u201d the jury foreman, Mark House, told Reuters. The judge should have been fined, House said, and kicked off the bench. \u201cThere is no justice, because he is still doing his job.\u201d\n\nJudicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in America\u2019s courts and, absent tough consequences, could give judges license to behave with impunity.\n\n\u201cWhen you see cases like that, the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system,\u201d said Steve Scheckman, a lawyer who directed Louisiana\u2019s oversight agency and served as deputy director of New York\u2019s. \u201cIt looks like a good ol\u2019 boys club.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime Alabama judge who concurrently served on the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission. The judge, Cullman District Court\u2019s Kim Chaney, remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission. In at least 200 cases, court records show, Judge Chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent, enabling the younger Chaney to earn at least $105,000 in fees over two years.\n\nIn February, months after Reuters repeatedly asked Chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases, he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation.\n\nTommy Drake, the lawyer who first filed a complaint against Chaney in 2016, said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if Reuters hadn\u2019t examined the case.\n\n\u201cYou know the only reason they did anything about Chaney is because you guys started asking questions,\u201d Drake said. \u201cOtherwise, he\u2019d still be there.\u201d\n\nBedrock of American justice\n\nState and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the American criminal justice system, touching the lives of millions of people every year.\n\nThe country\u2019s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually. The nearly 30,000 state, county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket: more than 100 million new cases each year, from traffic to divorce to murder. Their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice. Their powers are vast and varied \u2013 from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child.\n\nEach U.S. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges. The authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts, which can reverse a judge\u2019s legal ruling and order a new trial. Judicial commissions cannot change verdicts. Rather, they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal.\n\nFew experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly, respecting the law and those who appear before them. And some contend that, when judges do falter, oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior. \u201cWith a few notable exceptions, the commissions generally get it right,\u201d said Keith Swisher, a University of Arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics.\n\nOthers disagree. They note that the clout of these commissions is limited, and their authority differs from state to state. To remove a judge, all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges. And most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers.\n\nAs a result, the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it: people like Marquita Johnson.\n\nReuters scoured thousands of state investigative files, disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct. The examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge\u2019s misconduct. The victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases.\n\nThe number is a conservative estimate. The tally doesn\u2019t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct.\n\n\u201cIf we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims, then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about.\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges. The judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed senior judge Arthur Grim to lead a victim review, and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles. Grim told Reuters that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct.\n\n\u201cIf we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims, then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about,\u201d Grim said.\n\nIn another review underway in Ohio, state public defender Tim Young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism. Mike Benza, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose students are helping identify victims, compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power. \u201cYou see one case and then you look to see if it's systemic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe review, which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic, may take a year. But Young said the time-consuming task is essential because \u201ca fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people.\u201d\n\n\u2018Special rules for judges\u2019\n\nMost states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice. Perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of America\u2019s system for overseeing judges than Alabama.\n\nAs in most states, Alabama\u2019s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission is a mix of lawyers, judges and laypeople. All are appointed. Their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation.\n\nAlabama\u2019s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult. The complaint must be notarized, which means that in theory, anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury. Complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing; those that arrive by phone, email or without a notary stamp are not investigated, although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected. Anonymous written complaints are shredded.\n\nThese rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation, commission director Jenny Garrett noted in response to written questions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint,\u201d said Sue Bell Cobb, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2007 to 2011. In 2009, she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an American Bar Association report that offered a scathing review of Alabama's rules.\n\nIn most other states, commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email, even anonymous ones, or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing. In Alabama, staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself, which convenes about every seven weeks.\n\nBy rule, the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation. If a subpoena is issued, the judge receives a simultaneous copy, raising fears about witness intimidation. If a witness gives investigators a statement, the judge receives a transcript. In the U.S. justice system, such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the need for special rules for judges?\u201d said Michael Levy, a Washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal, corporate, congressional and securities investigations. \u201cIf judges think it\u2019s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas, why don\u2019t judges think it\u2019s fair to investigate judges in the same way?\u201d\n\nAlabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially. Reuters interviews and a review of Alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective \u201cguidance.\u201d The identities of those judges remain confidential, as does the conduct that prompted the meetings. \u201cNot every violation warrants discipline,\u201d commission director Garrett said.\n\nSince 2008, the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges, including Hayes, charging two this year.\n\nTwo of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved Roy Moore, who was twice forced out as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders.\n\nAnother Alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint, however. Tom Parker, first elected to the state\u2019s high court in 2004, pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage.\n\nParker sued the commission in federal court, arguing the agency was infringing on his First Amendment rights. He won. Although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling, it was ordered to cover Parker\u2019s legal fees: $100,000, or about a fifth of the agency\u2019s total annual budget.\n\nIn 2018, the people of Alabama elected Parker chief justice.\n\nThese days, Parker told Reuters, Alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy \u201ca much better relationship\u201d that\u2019s less politically tinged. \u201cHow can I say it? It\u2019s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now.\u201d\n\n\u201cGut instinct\u201d\n\nMontgomery, Alabama has a deep history of racial conflict, as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city\u2019s great seal: \u201cCradle of the Confederacy\u201d and \u201cBirthplace of the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d\n\nJefferson Davis was inaugurated here as Confederate president after the South seceded from the Union in 1861, and his birthday is a state holiday. As was common throughout the South, the city was the site of the lynchings of Black men, crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here. Police arrested civil rights icon Rosa Parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger.\n\nToday, about 60% of Montgomery\u2019s 198,000 residents are Black, U.S. census records show. Even so, Black motorists account for about 90% of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets, a Reuters examination of court records found. Much of Judge Hayes\u2019 work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines. Hayes, who is white, told Reuters that \u201cthe majority of people who come before the court are Black.\u201d\n\nCity officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants, no matter how minor the offense.\n\nIn April 2012, Marquita Johnson was among them. Appearing before Hayes on a Wednesday morning, the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break.\n\nJohnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance. She had insurance, she said. But when she was pulled over, she couldn\u2019t find the card to prove it.\n\nEven a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary. In addition to fines, the court assessed a $155 fee to every ticket. Court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop \u2013 a practice some residents call \u201cstacking.\u201d\n\nUnder state law, failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver\u2019s license. Johnson\u2019s decision to keep driving nonetheless \u2013 taking her children to school or to doctor visits, getting groceries, going to work \u2013 led to more tickets and deeper debt.\n\n\u201cI told Judge Hayes that I had lost my job and needed more time to pay,\u201d she recounted.\n\nBy Hayes\u2019 calculation, Johnson owed more than $12,000 in fines. He sentenced Johnson to 496 days in jail. Hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $25 toward the outstanding debt. A different judge later determined that Johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by Hayes, and that Hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid. To shave time off her sentence, Johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed.\n\nHayes told Reuters that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe. \u201cWith my years of experience, I can tell when someone is being truthful with me,\u201d Hayes said. He called it \u201cgut instinct\u201d -- though he added, in a statement this week, that he also consulted \u201ceach defendant's criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court.\u201d\n\nOf course, the law demands more of a judge than a gut call. In a 1983 landmark decision, Bearden v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has \u201cwillfully\u201d chosen not to pay a fine.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s judicial oversight commission, \u201cJudge Hayes did not make any inquiry into Ms. Johnson\u2019s ability to pay, whether her non-payment was willful.\u201d\n\nFrom jail, \u201cI prayed to return to my daughters,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI was sure that someone would realize that Hayes had made a mistake.\u201d\n\nShe said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter\u2019s 3rd birthday. From a jail telephone, she tried to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d but slumped to the floor in grief.\n\n\u201cShe was choking up and crying,\u201d said Johnson\u2019s mother, Blanche, who was on the call. \u201cShe was devastated to be away from her children so long.\u201d\n\nWhen Johnson was freed after 10 months in jail, she learned that strangers had abused her two older children. One is now a teenager; the other is in middle school. \u201cMy kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMy daughters get frantic when I leave the house. I know they\u2019ve had nightmares that I\u2019m going to disappear again.\u201d\n\nSix months after Johnson\u2019s release, Hayes jailed another single Black mother. Angela McCullough, then 40, had been pulled over driving home from Faulkner University, a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average. As a mother of four children, including a disabled adult son, she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor.\n\nPolice ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights. After a background check, the officer arrested McCullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets. She was later brought before Hayes.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go to jail,\u201d McCullough recalled pleading with the judge. \u201cI\u2019m a mother. I have a disabled son who needs me.\u201d\n\nHayes sentenced McCullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $1,350, court records show. Her adult son, diagnosed with schizophrenia, was held in an institution until her release.\n\nMcCullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence. One day, she recalled, she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists.\n\nShe was freed after 20 days, using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets, she said.\n\nJail was the darkest chapter of her life, McCullough said, a place where \u201cthe devil was trying to take my mind.\u201d Today, she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to afford to go back.\u201d\n\nA clear sign that something was amiss in Montgomery courts came in November 2013, when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor. A similar suit was filed in 2014, and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015. Johnson and McCullough were plaintiffs.\n\nThe lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer killed a Black teenager in 2014. In a scathing report on the origins of the unrest, the U.S. Department of Justice exposed how Ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines, a practice that fell disproportionately hard on Black residents.\n\n\u201cMontgomery is just like Ferguson,\u201d said Karen Jones, a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit. Jones has led recent protests in Montgomery in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, the Black man whose death under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice.\n\nIn Montgomery, \u201ceverybody knew that the police targeted Black residents. And I sat in Hayes\u2019 court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money, then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city.\u201d\n\nIt was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against Hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission. The oversight agency opened its Hayes case in summer 2015, nearly two years after plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body. Hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension.\n\nUnder its own rules, the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate Hayes at any time. Commission director Garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn\u2019t investigate sooner. The investigation went slowly, Garrett said, because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records. The commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017, Garrett said, issuing charges against five judges, including Moore.\n\n\u201cSlap in the face\u201d\n\nA few months after Judge Hayes\u2019 suspension ended, his term as a municipal judge was set to expire. So, the Montgomery City Council took up the question of the judge\u2019s future on March 6, 2018. On the agenda of its meeting: whether to reappoint Hayes to another four-year term.\n\nHayes wasn\u2019t in the audience that night, but powerful supporters were. The city\u2019s chief judge, Milton Westry, told the council that Hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants, \u201csince we learned a better way of doing things.\u201d In the wake of the suits, Westry said, Hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines.\n\nAs part of a settlement in the civil case, the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years. Those reforms have since been abandoned, Reuters found. Both measures were deemed too expensive, Hayes and city officials confirmed.\n\nResidents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing Hayes. Jones, the community activist, reminded council members that Hayes had \u201cpleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold.\u201d\n\nThe city council voted to rehire Hayes to a fifth consecutive term.\n\nMarquita Johnson said she can\u2019t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed.\n\n\u201cHiring Hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was a message that we don't matter.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Hayes will retire from the bench. In an earlier interview with Reuters, he declined to discuss the Johnson case. Asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out, he paused.\n\n\u201cI think, maybe, I could have been more sympathetic at times,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cSometimes you miss a few.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Isabella Jibilian, Andrea Januta and Blake Morrison. Edited by Morrison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA watchdog accused, a pattern of rulings delayed, a repeat offender Three recent cases illustrate how Alabama judges who were cited for wrongdoing were able to remain on the bench for years. Judge Chaney: Enforced, broke rules What happened when a trial judge who also served on the state\u2019s judicial oversight board was accused of misbehavior. Alex Chaney was just a year out of law school in 2015 when he started receiving lucrative appointments at taxpayer expense. A district judge began assigning him to represent people too poor to afford a lawyer. That judge was his dad, Kim Chaney. Judge Chaney is a powerful figure in rural Cullman County, where he was first elected to the bench in 1992. Chaney serves on a local bank board and has led several statewide justice associations. In 2012, the governor honored Chaney by selecting him to also serve on Alabama\u2019s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission, which investigates misconduct by judges. While on the commission, Chaney broke its ethics laws in his own courtroom. In 2016, local attorney Tommy Drake filed a complaint against Chaney, alleging that the judge was appointing his son to represent indigent defendants, violating ethics rules that prohibit nepotism. Alex Chaney was paid $105,000 from 2015 to 2017 by the state for such court-appointed work, accounting records show. Because Judge Chaney served on the judicial commission, Drake sent his complaint to a different state watchdog agency, the Alabama Ethics Commission. On October 4, 2017, the Ethics Commission found that Judge Chaney violated ethics rules and referred the case to the state attorney general. The following day, records show, Judge Chaney resigned from the Judicial Inquiry Commission. But he remained a trial judge in Cullman. Eighteen months passed. Last summer, a Reuters reporter began asking state officials about the status of the case. The officials declined to comment. In November, Reuters sent Judge Chaney and his son queries. They did not respond. The judge\u2019s lawyer, John Henig Jr, wrote to Reuters: \u201cJudge Chaney is a person of remarkably good character and would never knowingly do anything unethical or wrong.\u201d Henig said that Judge Chaney appointed his son from a rotating list of lawyers to represent indigent defendants. Henig called the appointments \u201cministerial\u201d in nature. \u201cIf Judge Chaney\u2019s son\u2019s name was the next name on the list for appointments, Judge Chaney would call out his son\u2019s name and thereafter immediately recuse himself from the case,\u201d Henig wrote. A Reuters review of court records showed otherwise: Judge Chaney participated in several cases after appointing his son and issued substantive decisions. For example, records show that the judge reduced bond for one of his son\u2019s clients, and approved another\u2019s motion to plead guilty. Henig did not respond to questions about these records. This February 7 \u2013 eight months after Reuters began inquiring about Chaney \u2013 the commission charged the judge with appointing his son to more than 200 cases and making rulings in some of them. Chaney struck a deal with the commission and retired from the bench, avoiding a trial. During a hearing to approve the deal, commission lawyer Elizabeth Bern said Chaney should have known better than to appoint his son, especially given that he did so while a member of the oversight agency. During Chaney\u2019s tenure, the commission had disciplined two judges who abused their office to benefit a relative. \u201cThe nepotism provision is clear and unequivocal without exception,\u201d she said. Chaney did not speak during the hearing. Drake, the lawyer who filed the complaint in 2016, said that absent the Reuters inquiries, he doubts Chaney would have retired from the bench because he is so politically powerful. Indeed, shortly after the judge stepped down in disgrace for steering work to his son, the local bar association issued a resolution praising him. Of Chaney, the local lawyers said, \u201cHe has always maintained the highest ethical and moral standards of the office and has been an example to all, what a judge should represent.\u201d Judge Kelly: \u201cCallous indifference\u201d How a judge left children in limbo by repeatedly failing to perform her most basic duty: ruling on cases. Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Anita Kelly hears time-sensitive family matters such as child custody, adoption and divorce \u2013 cases in which a child remains in limbo until she rules. Starting in 2014, court and judicial commission records show, word of years-long delays in her cases began to emerge from foster parents, lawyers, social workers and appeals court judges. Commission officials are barred by law from discussing the case, but Reuters pieced together the scope of the investigation through juvenile court records, public documents and interviews with people involved. In May 2014, foster parents Cheri and Travis Norwood filed a complaint about Kelly with the judicial commission. They alleged the judge\u2019s incompetence led to a traumatic, years-long delay in which a foster child who began living with the Norwoods as an infant was taken away from them at age 3 \u00bd and returned to live with her teenage biological mother. \u201cIf Judge Kelly thought they should have been together, fine,\u201d Travis Norwood said in an interview. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t this happen sooner? Because children can\u2019t wait. You can\u2019t freeze a child, hold her in suspended animation until her mother is ready.\u201d Social workers who heard about the Norwood complaint forwarded their own concerns about Kelly\u2019s conduct in several other cases. Nonetheless, the commission dismissed the Norwood complaint in early 2015, finding \u201cno reasonable basis to charge the judge.\u201d Over the next year, more red flags emerged. State appeals court judges raised concerns about Kelly\u2019s \u201ccontinued neglect of her duty,\u201d citing at least five cases that had untenable delays. In November 2015, a supreme court justice criticized the nearly three years it took to determine one child\u2019s fate. \u201cI refuse to be another adult who has totally failed this child,\u201d Justice Tommy Bryan wrote. Another 20 months passed before the judicial commission took action. In August 2017, it charged Kelly with delays that \u201cmanifest a callous indifference or lack of comprehension\u201d to children\u2019s well-being. One child\u2019s case, it noted, had dragged on for five years. Kelly took her case to trial before the Court of the Judiciary, the special tribunal that weighs charges against judges. Her attorney argued that the judge worked hard and had shown no ill intent. In 2018, the tribunal found Kelly failed to \u201cmaintain professional competence.\u201d Kelly was suspended for 90 days. Still, she kept her job. The court said it likely would have removed Kelly from the bench if not for two factors: Voters re-elected her in 2016, and she exhibited \u201cgood character and the lack of evidence of scandal or corruption on her part.\u201d Her lawyer, Henry Lewis Gillis, applauded her reinstatement and said the delays never affected the quality of her decisions. \u201cJudge Kelly cannot change yesterday,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cRather, she chooses to learn from her past experiences as she continues to handle the many, many, many cases that come before her today.\u201d Judge Wiggins: Give blood or go to jail A judge who is a repeat offender \u2013 four times over \u2013 remains on the bench. Circuit Judge Marvin Wiggins has been hit with misconduct charges by Alabama\u2019s judicial conduct commission four times over the past decade. In 2009, he was reprimanded and suspended for 90 days for failing to recuse himself from a voter fraud investigation involving his relatives. \u201cThe public must be able to trust that our judges will dispense justice fairly and impartially,\u201d the Court of the Judiciary concluded. \u201cJudge Wiggins, by his actions, disregarded that trust.\u201d In 2016 \u2013 in a case that made global headlines \u2013 Wiggins was censured for offering defendants the option of giving blood instead of going to jail for failing to pay fines. A local blood drive happened to be taking place at the courthouse that day. \u201cIf you do not have any money and you don\u2019t want to go to jail, as an option to pay it, you can give blood today,\u201d Wiggins told dozens of defendants, according to a recording. \u201cConsider that as a discount rather than putting you in jail, if you do not have any money.\u201d Forty-one defendants gave blood that day, and the commission called Wiggins\u2019 conduct \u201creprehensible and inexcusable.\u201d Wiggins acknowledged that his comments were inappropriate, but noted he did not send anyone to jail that day for failure to pay fines. ALERT US TO WRONGDOING Not all judges who have violated their oaths of office, broken the law or misbehaved on the bench have been brought before their states\u2019 oversight commission. If you know of a judge who may have committed misconduct, please send us details at tips@thomsonreuters.com.

Wiggins\u2019 lawyer, Joe Espy III, said that the judge \u201chas always tried to cooperate\u201d with authorities. Espy noted that Wiggins is a community leader, an ordained pastor and has been repeatedly re-elected to the bench for more than 20 years. \u201cHe is not only a good judge but a good person,\u201d Espy said. Last year, Wiggins was reprimanded for directly calling the father in a custody dispute \u2013 a conversation that violated a rule prohibiting a judge from discussing a case without both sides present. A recording of the call became a key piece of evidence against Wiggins. In preparation for trial in that case, the commission said it found a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of similar one-sided calls. The commission also said it found evidence that Wiggins was meeting with divorce litigants in his chambers without lawyers present. In November, this prompted a new commission case against Wiggins \u2013 his fourth in 10 years. \u201cAt a very minimum,\u201d the commission alleged, his track record indicates a \u201cpattern of carelessness or indifferent disregard or lack of respect for the high standards imposed on the judiciary.\u201d But at a pretrial hearing in January, and in a subsequent order, Wiggins scored a victory before the Alabama tribunal that issues final judgment on such cases, the Court of the Judiciary. The presiding judge raised questions about whether proper procedures had been followed in the case against Wiggins. Three weeks later, the commission dropped the case. And Wiggins returned to the bench.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Teflon Robe By Michael Berens and John Shiffman Contributing reporting: Andrea Januta and Caroline Monahan Data: Michael Berens, John Shiffman and Isabella Jibilian Photo editing: Corinne Perkins Video: Craig Hettich Art direction: Troy Dunkley and Pete Hausler Edited by Blake Morrison",
