California could be a leader in making this happen . In August , dozens of young people like myself from across the state rallied and conducted repeated legislative visits in support of Assemblymember Evan Low \u2019 s bill , Assembly Constitutional Amendment Eight ( ACA 8 ) , which would amend the state constitution to drop the voting age to 17 for all state-wide elections .
