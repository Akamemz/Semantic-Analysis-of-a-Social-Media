Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 12 , 2020\nJonathan Kravis , the deputy chief of the fraud and public corruption section in the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Office in Washington , said in a court filing on Tuesday afternoon that he had resigned his government job . Two former prosecutors for Mueller , Aaron Zelinsky and Adam Jed , also notified the court that they were stepping off the case , as did a D.C.-based prosecutor , Michael Marando .\nThe extraordinary exit of every prosecutor who shepherded the Stone case came one day after they urged that he be sentenced to between about seven and nine years in prison on his conviction on charges of impeding congressional and FBI investigations into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nThat prompted Trump to blast federal prosecutors on Twitter just before 2 a.m. Tuesday for urging such a long prison sentence for Stone , the veteran GOP political consultant and provocateur found guilty by a jury last year on seven felony counts brought by Mueller .\n`` This is a horrible and very unfair situation , '' Trump wrote . `` The real crimes were on the other side , as nothing happens to them . Can not allow this miscarriage of justice ! ''\nTrump expanded on his view while speaking to reporters late Tuesday afternoon , but he denied that he had asked the Justice Department to change the sentence recommendation .\n\u201c I thought the recommendation was ridiculous . I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous , \u201c the president said . \u201c I thought it was an insult to our country and it shouldn \u2018 t happen. \u201c\nHe also indicated that he viewed the case against Stone as a vendetta that Mueller \u2018 s prosecutors carried on even after his departure last May .\n\u201c These were the same Mueller people that put everybody through hell and I think it 's a disgrace , \u201c the president said . \u201c They ought to be ashamed of themselves. \u201c\nLater , Trump used Twitter to take a swipe at the judge scheduled to sentence Stone , Amy Berman Jackson , an Obama appointee who has overseen several other Mueller-related cases .\n\u201c Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT , something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure ?
