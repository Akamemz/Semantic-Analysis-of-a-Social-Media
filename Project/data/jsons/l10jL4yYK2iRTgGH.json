    "content": "When people in the center or on the left go after Ross Douthat , the New York Times \u2019 supposedly reform-minded right-wing columnist , it \u2019 s usually because he \u2019 s written something retrograde about LGBTQ people , sex or feminism . What often goes less appreciated , though , is that as clueless as Douthat frequently is on matters of sexuality and gender , he \u2019 s nearly as misguided when it comes to issues of race . His most recent piece , a meditation on the unrest in Ferguson and the resurgence of \u201c identity-based politics \u201d in America , is a case in point . In little more than 900 words , Douthat \u2019 s column is a bravura display of how not to think about the politics of race .\nUnlike much of Douthat \u2019 s work \u2014 which tends to be characterized by its measured prose and its self-conscious desire to sound \u201c reasonable \u201d to liberal Times readers \u2019 ears \u2014 the piece doesn \u2019 t chug along inoffensively before suddenly reaching a terrible conclusion . No , this one \u2019 s a mess from the start . \u201c Last summer , \u201d Douthat writes , \u201c around the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s \u2018 I Have a Dream \u2019 speech , I wrote a column making \u2014 gingerly \u2014 a case for optimism about race and politics in America. \u201d From today \u2019 s perspective , he concedes , the column doesn \u2019 t look great . Watching as Ferguson \u201c seethed and smoldered , \u201d Douthat writes , forced him to make \u201c a case for greater pessimism. \u201d Not because the behavior of the authorities in Ferguson revealed the farcical nature of the \u201c post-racial \u201d myth , mind you , but because of a favorite scapegoat of straight , white and male pundits like Douthat : identity politics .\n\u201c Ultimately , \u201d Douthat explains , \u201c being optimistic about race requires being optimistic about the ability of our political coalitions to offer colorblind visions of the American dream. \u201d For Democrats , Douthat argues , that means \u201c stressing economics more heavily \u201d ; while for Republicans it means \u201c leaning more on family and community \u201d ( whatever that means ) . The problem , at least as Douthat sees it , is that \u201c neither coalition has done a very good job selling such a vision , because neither knows how to deliver on it. \u201d The result ? Two parties that are \u201c increasingly dependent on identity-politics appeals. \u201d The left has \u201c race , ethnicity and gender , \u201d while the right \u2019 s got \u201c white-Christian-heartland cultural anxieties. \u201d And just like that , Douthat \u2019 s turned the Ferguson story \u2014 which was about institutional racism and police brutality \u2014 into a platform for the most intellectually bankrupt of columns , the attack on both sides .\nDouthat \u2019 s move here is subtle , so it \u2019 s worth pausing and reminding ourselves of the controversy he \u2019 s arguing is both sides \u2019 fault . This summer , Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown , an 18-year-old who at the time of his death was not armed . Brown \u2019 s body was left in the middle of the street , exposed , for hours . After a grand jury process that was unusual in multiple ways ( all of which were more likely to have been in Wilson \u2019 s benefit ) it was decided that Wilson , who described Brown as demonic and beyond reason , would not have to stand trial for ending Brown \u2019 s life . Throughout the ordeal , peaceful protesters not only had to withstand a series of suspiciously one-sided leaks , but a hostile police force that was not only absurdly militarized but also disproportionately white . And when the non-indictment came in \u2014 after multiple tension-building delays , and at the dark of night , when already anxious crowd-control officers were less able to maintain surveillance \u2014 a small number of protesters predictably began to riot .\nNow , unless you \u2019 re willing to claim that a relative handful of unarmed and economically disadvantaged protesters has the same amount of power as the State of Missouri , it \u2019 s totally ridiculous to describe the Ferguson situation as being a problem of both sides \u2019 creation . If a bodybuilder hit me for no reason and I yelled at him in response , the two of us would not be equally at fault . To be sure , there are millions of ( mostly white ) Americans who are apparently comfortable making that profoundly silly argument ; quite likely , many of them also believe American racism is now mostly anti-white . I \u2019 m sure they find Douthat \u2019 s shifting half the blame from the powerful to the powerless to be eminently just . I \u2019 m sure they , too , were happy to share John McWhorter \u2019 s critique of Michael Brown as an imperfect victim , as Douthat does near his piece \u2019 s end .\nBut as the torture-excusing Douthat himself noted in another recent column , this one on the supposed Caesarism of the president \u2019 s immigration actions , the majority isn \u2019 t always correct . Whether it \u2019 s physical or numerical , might does not make right . Every white person in the country could reject her own country \u2019 s history and blame black people for their own oppression , but that wouldn \u2019 t make the claim any less deserving of contempt . There are truths of politics and history that go beyond the whims of public opinion and conventional wisdom . As Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote recently , there are things that are undeniable but can not be said . In theory , it \u2019 s Douthat \u2019 s job to recognize those things , to call them out , to write them down , to help us see what \u2019 s in front of our noses , which is , as Orwell said , a constant struggle .\nOn these scores and others , Douthat \u2019 s latest falls short . But at least he \u2019 s not the only one talking . In a new must-read interview with Frank Rich , the comedian and filmmaker Chris Rock weighs in on Ferguson , too . And perhaps because most of being a comedian is , he says , being able to \u201c notice things people don \u2019 t notice , \u201d Rock \u2019 s understanding of Ferguson is conspicuously unlike Douthat \u2019 s and much closer to the truth . \u201c When we talk about race relations in America or racial progress , \u201d Rock said , \u201c it \u2019 s all nonsense. \u201d Douthat frets about how identity politics hurts race relations , but as Rock notes , there is no such thing . \u201c White people were crazy , \u201d Rock explained . \u201c Now they \u2019 re not as crazy . To say that black people have made progress would be to say they deserve what happened to them before. \u201d There aren \u2019 t two sides in Missouri , in other words , but only one : that of the powers that be in Ferguson , whose culpability Douthat , like so many others , still refuses to face .",
