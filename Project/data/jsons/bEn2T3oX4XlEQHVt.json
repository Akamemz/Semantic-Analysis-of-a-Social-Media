Marco Rubio , who pulled out of the presidential race on Tuesday after failing to take down Trump , had a grim assessment of the Republican Party 's state of play on his first day back at work in the Senate on Thursday .\n`` Hopefully there 's time to still prevent a Trump nomination , which I think would fracture the party and be damaging to the conservative movement , '' Rubio told reporters .\nAnti-Trump forces are getting a sense of the backlash they 'd face if they deny him the nomination . Trump warned earlier this week on CNN 's `` New Day '' that the convention could deteriorate into a `` riot '' if he is blocked from power .\nAnd on Friday , a top Trump aide threatened to give up his credentials as a convention delegate and leave the Republican Party in a stark warning to the GOP about the `` consequences '' if Trump is blocked from the nomination .\n`` I will tell you this , if the Republican Party comes into that convention and jimmies with the rules and takes away the will of the people , the will of the Republicans and the Democrats and Independents who voted for Mr. Trump , I will take off my credentials , I will leave the floor of that convention , and I will leave the Republican Party forever , '' Sam Clovis , a national co-chair for Trump 's campaign , said Friday on `` New Day . ''\nThe deepening anxiety in the GOP was underscored by a meeting in Washington Thursday of prominent conservative leaders dedicated to finding a way to prevent Trump from securing the 1,237 delegates needed for the nomination .\nTrump 's failure to win Ohio on an otherwise successful night of primaries Tuesday opened a narrow window for opposing forces in the Republican Party to wrest the nomination from him because it lengthened his odds of winning a majority of delegates .
