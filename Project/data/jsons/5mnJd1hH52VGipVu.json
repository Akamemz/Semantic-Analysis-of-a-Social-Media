    "content": "For the last two weeks or so , I have been trying to stay focused on my work on Clarence Thomas , but all the liberal commentary on the Democratic primary has gotten me so irritated that I keep finding myself back on social media , posting , tweeting , commenting and the like . So I figured I \u2019 d bring everything that I \u2019 ve been saying about the election campaign there , here . In no particular order . And with no effort to be scholarly or scientific . Just my random observations and musings\u2026\nThe dossier , prepared by opponents of Sanders and passed on to the Guardian by a source who would only agree to be identified as \u201c a Democrat \u201d , alleges that Sanders \u201c sympathized with the USSR during the Cold War \u201d because he went on a trip there to visit a twinned city while he was mayor of Burlington . Similar \u201c associations with communism \u201d in Cuba are catalogued alongside a list of quotes about countries ranging from China to Nicaragua in a way that supporters regard as bordering on the McCarthyite rather than fairly reflecting his views .\nThis is becoming a straight-up rerun of the 1948 campaign against Henry Wallace . Except that Clinton is running well to the right of Truman and even , in some respects , Dewey . It seems as if Clinton is campaigning for the vote of my Grandpa Nat . There \u2019 s only one problem with this strategy : He \u2019 s been dead for nearly a quarter-century .\nAs was true of McCarthyism , it \u2019 s not really Sanders \u2019 communism or his socialism that has got today \u2019 s McCarthyites in the Democratic Party worried ; it \u2019 s actually his liberalism . As this article in the Times makes clear :\n\u201c Some third party will say , \u2018 This is what the first ad of the general election is going to look like , \u2019 \u201d said James Carville , the longtime Clinton adviser , envisioning a commercial savaging Mr. Sanders for supporting tax increases and single-payer health care . \u201c Once you get the nomination , they are not going to play nice. \u201d \u2026 A Sanders-led ticket generates two sets of fears among Clinton supporters : that other Democratic candidates could be linked to his staunchly liberal views , particularly his call to raise taxes , even on middle-class families , to help finance his universal health care plan ; and that more mainstream Democrats would have to answer to voters uneasy about what it means to be a European-style social democrat .\nRaising taxes to pay for popular social programs : That used to be the bread and butter of the Democratic Party liberalism . Now it \u2019 s socialism . And that\u2014now it \u2019 s socialism\u2014used to be the bread and butter of Republican Party revanchism . Now it \u2019 s Democratic Party liberalism .\nThe new line of argument against Sanders winning the nomination is that African American voters are Clinton \u2019 s \u201c firewall , \u201d which will engulf the Sanders campaign once it heads South .\nThere have been God knows how many articles making this claim over the last two days , celebrating the Clintons \u2019 deep and storied relations with the black community\u2014how , whatever the Clintons \u2019 policy positions ( support for mass incarceration , welfare reform , etc . ) , both Hillary and Bill do the kind of retail and symbolic politics that black voters care most about . ( I \u2019 ll note in passing but not comment on the patronizing condescension of this position ) . And that we \u2019 ll see all of this come into play after Iowa , when the campaign heads to South Carolina .\nBut first let \u2019 s go to the Wayback Machine and see how black leaders in South Carolina responded in 2008 the last time the Clintons worked their magic there :\nBlack leaders widely criticized Mr. Clinton after he equated the eventual victory of Mr. Obama in the South Carolina primary in January to that of the Rev . Jesse Jackson in the 1988 caucus , a parallel that many took as an effort to diminish Mr. Obama \u2019 s success in the campaign\u2026.In an interview with The New York Times late Thursday , Mr. Clyburn [ 3rd ranking Democrat in the US House of Representatives ] said Mr. Clinton \u2019 s conduct in this campaign had caused what might be an irreparable breach between Mr. Clinton and an African-American constituency that once revered him .\nSpeaking of Jim Clyburn and South Carolina , he was on NBC recently , talking about Clinton \u2019 s firewall in 2016 . Start listening at 2:30 , where he says that if Sanders wins by ten points in Iowa , that firewall could disappear very quickly . As it did in 2008 .\nAnd lo and behold : According to a poll released last week , support for Clinton in South Carolina is plummeting . Back in December , Clinton had a 36-point lead over Sanders . As of last week , that lead has been cut nearly in half . Forty-seven percent of Democratic voters now favor Clinton ; 28 % favor Sanders . That \u2019 s still a lot of support for Clinton , but it \u2019 s considerably smaller than in December , when she had 67 % of the vote .\nNow it \u2019 s true that Sanders hasn \u2019 t gotten those defectors from Clinton . What seems to have happened is that a significant chunk of her supporters are reconsidering their support ( Sanders \u2019 s support is nearly what it was in December ) . Which could mean many things . One possibility is that voters are waiting to see what happens in Iowa and New Hampshire , where Sanders is doing well .\nBut the most interesting part of the polls is the racial and gender breakdown of the vote : Clinton is losing a higher percentage of her black supporters than of her white supporters , and Sanders is making greater gains among women than among men .\nOn December 17 , this is how the polls looked ( see the thirteenth page , which is labeled page six ) :\nOn January 22 ( the poll was actually concluded on the 15th ) , this is how the polls looked :\nBetween December and January , we see major drops in support for Clinton among all categories of voters . But there \u2019 s a greater drop among black voters ( 30 % ) than among white voters ( 24 % drop ) . There \u2019 s also a virtually identical drop among male ( 36 % ) and female ( 34 % ) voters .\nSanders \u2019 s support among black voters remains practically the same as it was in December ( he sees a tiny drop among white voters ) . But more interesting is that while he \u2019 s made gains among both male and female voters , the gains among women ( 28 % ) are much greater than among men ( 13 % ) .\n3 . Sister Souljah Moment Remember Sister Souljah ? In 1992 , Bill Clinton chose to go after her as a signal to white voters that he and the Democrats were no longer beholden to black voters . It was a signature moment not only for him but also for the Democratic Party : They weren \u2019 t going to be the party of quotas , welfare and black people . Which makes the claim that Sanders is bad\u2014and Clinton is great\u2014on race all the more galling . Have we forgotten everything ? Well , there \u2019 s one figure in the United States today who hasn \u2019 t : Sister Souljah . Back in November , she spoke out against Clinton \u2019 s campaign . 4 . A Little Nutty and a Little Slutty Speaking of forgetting everything : David Brock , the man who called Anita Hill \u201c a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty , \u201d now says \u201c black lives don \u2019 t matter much to Bernie Sanders. \u201d Brock is described here as \u201c a top Clinton ally \u201d who \u201c runs several super PACs aiding her candidacy. \u201d Only in this country could such a charlatan make these sorts of claims and get away with it . 5 . Dissolve the People , Elect Another As Sanders surges in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire\u2014opening up an 8-point lead in Iowa and a 27-point lead in New Hampshire\u2014and the pundits and party elites get squirmier and squirmier about his possible victory , I \u2019 m reminded of this line from Brecht : Would it not be easier\nFirst they came for the Revolution and I did not speak out because I was not a Revolution . Then they came for the Parliamentary Socialism and I did not speak out because I was not a Parliamentary Socialism . Then they came for the Third Party and I did not speak out because I was not a Third Party . Then they came for the Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party and I did not speak out because I was not a Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party . Then they came for the Green Lantern and I did not speak out because I was not a Green Lantern . Then they came for me but that was cool because I \u2019 m a Democrat .\n7 . Camera Obscura Speaking of German writers , in `` The German Ideology , '' Marx wrote , \u201c In all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a camera obscura. \u201d I was reminded of that quote when I stumbled across this story from the summer . Back in July , while everyone was touting Clinton \u2019 s sensitivity and deftness ( and Sanders \u2019 insensitivity and tone-deafness ) around issues of mass incarceration and Black Lives Matter , this little tidbit was reported in the Intercept . And completely ignored : Lobbyists for two major prison companies are serving as top fundraisers for Hillary Clinton\u2026.Richard Sullivan , of the lobbying firm Capitol Counsel , is a bundler for the Clinton campaign , bringing in $ 44,859 in contributions in a few short months . Sullivan is also a registered lobbyist for the Geo Group , a company that operates a number of jails , including immigrant detention centers , for profit . As we reported yesterday , fully five Clinton bundlers work for the lobbying and law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld . Corrections Corporation of America , the largest private prison company in America , paid Akin Gump $ 240,000 in lobbying fees last year . The firm also serves as a law firm for the prison giant , representing the company in court\u2026.The Geo Group , in a disclosure statement for its investors , notes that its business could be \u201c adversely affected by changes in existing criminal or immigration laws , crime rates in jurisdictions in which we operate , the relaxation of criminal or immigration enforcement efforts , leniency in conviction , sentencing or deportation practices , and the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws or the loosening of immigration laws. \u201d Apparently , the new rule of American politics is : So long as you say the right thing , you can do anything . Postscript : In October , Clinton was forced to stop working with these clowns from the prison industrial complex . And return all the money . Sanders never had to return a dime . Because he never took a dime . 8 . Reparations Sanders has gotten a lot of heat from the left for saying he \u2019 s against reparations . It \u2019 s a complicated issue , the substance of which I don \u2019 t want to comment on here . Instead I \u2019 ll just note that in 2008 another presidential candidate was asked about his position on reparations . Here \u2019 s what he had to say : Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opposes offering reparations to the descendants of slaves , putting him at odds with some black groups and leaders.The man with a serious chance to become the nation \u2019 s first black president argues that government should instead combat the legacy of slavery by improving schools , health care and the economy for all . \u201c I have said in the past \u2014 and I \u2019 ll repeat again \u2014 that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed , \u201d the Illinois Democrat said recently . \u2026 \u201c Let \u2019 s not be naive . Sen. Obama is running for president of the United States , and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life , \u201d said Kibibi Tyehimba , co-chair of theNational Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America . \u201c In light of the demographics of this country , I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s realistic to expect him to do anything other than what he \u2019 s done. \u201d But this is not a position Obama adopted just for the presidential campaign . He voiced the same concerns about reparations during his successful run for the Senate in 2004 . I pointed this out on Twitter to Killer Mike , the rapper who \u2019 s supporting Sanders . He retweeted me , which may be just about the biggest endorsement on Twitter I \u2019 ve ever gotten . Except for that time Morgan Fairchild retweeted me . And that time John Cusack retweeted me . But who \u2019 s counting ? 9 . The Establishment After Human Rights Campaign and Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton , Sanders said they were part of \u201c the establishment. \u201d Clinton and her supporters made a big to-do of it . But this response from Garance Franke-Ruta was the most sublime : Bernie remarks a reminder how left economics & new social movements\u2014civil rights , women \u2019 s rights , gay rights\u2014have always been uneasy allies \u2014 Garance Franke-Ruta ( @ thegarance ) January 20 , 2016\nBack in 1985 , that old dinosaur of a socialist Bernie Sanders was signing a Gay Pride Day Proclamation on the grounds that gay rights were civil rights .\nBack in the 1990s , while the Clintons were supporting DOMA and `` don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell , '' that old dinosaur of a socialist helped lead the opposition to both policies on the grounds that they were anti-gay .\nAnd throughout his career in the Senate , Sanders got consistently higher ratings from civil rights organizations than Clinton did while she was a senator .\nThe only thing this whole episode is a reminder of is how poorly journalists do their job .\nSpeaking of the establishment , Clinton is now claiming that it \u2019 s Sanders who \u2019 s the establishment , while she is , I don \u2019 t know what . Whatever she calls herself , I wonder what she calls this :\nHillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign released a letter this week in which 10 foreign policy experts criticized her opponent Bernie Sanders \u2019 call for closer engagement with Iran and said Sanders had \u201c not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security. \u201d The missive from the Clinton campaign was covered widely in the press , but what wasn \u2019 t disclosed in the coverage is that fully half of the former State Department officials and ambassadors who signed the letter , and who are now backing Clinton , are now enmeshed in the military contracting establishment , which has benefited tremendously from escalating violence around the world , particularly in the Middle East . Here are some of the letter signatories \u2019 current employment positions that were not disclosed in the reporting of the letter : Former Assistant Defense Secretary Derek Chollet , former Pentagon and CIA Chief of Staff Jeremy Bash , and former Deputy National Security Adviser Julianne Smith are now employed by the consulting firm Beacon Global Strategies , a firm we profiled last year . Beacon Global Strategies \u2019 staff advises both Clinton and Republican candidates for president , including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio . The firm makes money by providing advice to a clientele that is primarily military contractors . Beacon Global Strategies , however , has refused to disclose the identity of its clients . Former Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns is a senior counselor at the Cohen Group , a consulting firm founded by former Defense Secretary William Cohen . The firm \u201c assists aerospace and defense firms on policy , business development , and transactions , \u201d including deals in the U.S. , Turkey , Israel , and the Middle East . Former Undersecretary of Defense Jim Miller is an advisory boardmember to Endgame Systems , a start-up that has been called the \u201c Blackwater of Hacking. \u201d Miller is also on the board of BEI Precision Systems & Space , a military contractor .\nYou \u2019 ll be hearing a lot in the coming weeks about what a political savant Hillary Clinton is\u2014and what a political naif Bernie Sanders is . You already have . On Sunday or Monday , I counted five such articles alone .\nHere \u2019 s some information to consider when you hear that kind of talk :\nEven though the Clinton team has sought to convey that it has built a national operation , the campaign has invested much of its resources in the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa , hoping that a victory there could marginalize Mr. Sanders and set Mrs. Clinton on the path to the nomination . As much as 90 percent of the campaign \u2019 s resources are now split between Iowa and the Brooklyn headquarters , according to an estimate provided by a person with direct knowledge of the spending . The campaign denied that figure . The campaign boasted last June , when Mrs. Clinton held her kickoff event on Roosevelt Island in New York , that it had at least one paid staff member in all 50 states . But the effort did not last , and the staff members were soon let go or reassigned\u2026.For all its institutional advantages , the Clinton campaign lags behind the Sanders operation in deploying paid staff members : For example , Mr. Sanders has campaign workers installed in all 11 of the states that vote on Super Tuesday . Mrs. Clinton does not .\nEven Bill Clinton is questioning the strategic wisdom of the Clinton campaign :\nBill Clinton is getting nervous.With polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire and barely behind , if at all , in Iowa , the former president is urging his wife to start looking toward the delegate-rich March primaries \u2014 a shift for an organizing strategy that \u2019 s been laser-focused on the early states . Bill Clinton , according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation , has been phoning campaign manager Robby Mook almost daily to express concerns about the campaign \u2019 s organization in the March voting states , which includes delegate bonanzas in Florida , Illinois , Ohio and Texas . Many Clinton allies share the president \u2019 s desire for more organization on the ground ; they see enthusiasm that \u2019 s ready to be channeled , but no channel yet in place . \u201c Iowa matters a ton , but it seems to be the campaign \u2019 s only focus , \u201d said one person close to the campaign \u2019 s operations in a March state \u2014 one of nearly a dozen Clinton allies with whom POLITICO spoke for this article . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be a long primary , and the campaign seems less prepared for it than they were in 2008 . \u201d\nLittle noticed in this week \u2019 s Des Moines Register-Bloomberg Politics Iowa poll was this finding : a remarkable 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus participants describe themselves as socialists , including 58 percent of Sanders \u2019 s supporters and about a third of Clinton \u2019 s .\nSenator Bernie Sanders \u2019 s speech on Thursday explaining his democratic socialist ideology carried little risk among supporters and other Democrats : A solid majority of them have a positive impression of socialism , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this month . Fifty-six percent of those Democratic primary voters questioned said they felt positive about socialism as a governing philosophy , versus 29 percent who took a negative view .\nAnother pundit trope is that Sanders is not popular among women . There is a gender gap in this primary , in fact , but it \u2019 s not only the one you may have heard about . According to the latest USA Today poll :\nThere is a gender gap as well \u2014 and not the one that favors Clinton among baby boomer women . Men under 35 support Sanders by 4 percentage points . Women back him by almost 20 points . The possibility of breaking new ground by electing the first female president apparently carries less persuasive power among younger women than their mothers \u2019 generation.Stone is ready to support Clinton , though she prefers Sanders . \u201c He \u2019 s actually talking about breaking up the big banks and helping income inequality , \u201d she says , \u201c and given that I \u2019 m currently unemployed , income inequality is pretty important . \u201d\nA fact that apparently has caught the Clinton campaign completely off-guard :\nMrs. Clinton and her team say they always anticipated the race would tighten , with campaign manager Robby Mook telling colleagues last spring that Mr. Sanders would be tough competition . Yet they were not prepared for Mr. Sanders to become so popular with young people and independents , especially women , whom Mrs. Clinton views as a key part of her base .\nChelsea Clinton , who lives in a Gramercy Park apartment that she and her husband bought three years ago for $ 10.5 million , says :\nI was curious if I could care about ( money ) on some fundamental level , and I couldn \u2019 t .\nReminds me of that old joke : One fish asks another , \u201c How \u2019 s the water ? \u201d The other replies , \u201c What the hell is water ? \u201d\n14 . The Immense and Shitty Hassle of Everyday Life Under Capitalism\u2026\nArin Dube launched an interesting discussion on his Facebook page the other day . Riffing off of a bunch of Paul Krugman \u2019 s posts , which are fairly critical of Sanders \u2019 healthcare plans , Arin wondered whether Sanders \u2019 focus on single-payer , after all the drama and struggle over Obamacare and its achievements in terms of extended coverage , really makes political sense .\nThere are excellent arguments on all sides , and Arin \u2019 s voice is always one that I listen to . But I posted this comment on his page because I have this nagging feeling that a lot of the discussion around healthcare and insurance in the media is missing a critical reality . I \u2019 m posting it less as a definitive statement and more as an opening to see if my own intuitions and experiences track with those of others . I recognize that I really could be an outlier here , so feel free to tell me that I am . I just find it hard to believe that my experience of this system is so completely sui generis .\nCan I speak to this less from the policy or political perspective or more from the individual perspective , as a way of getting to the political perspective ? My family has insurance : I get mine from CUNY and my wife and daughter get theirs from my wife \u2019 s employer . From what I can gather , we have decent insurance . Yet when I think about the mountains of time I have to spend dealing with health care and insurance\u2014the submission of forms , the resubmission of forms , haggling with the insurance companies to make sure things that should be covered are covered ( or simply to make sure that forms are being processed at all ) , getting the doctor to revise forms b/c the diagnostic or procedure codes may not be correct or may have changed ( which they do with alarming frequency , it seems ) \u2014and the consistent surprises I experience about how much we still have to pay\u2014after the deductibles , the premiums , the co-pays , the out-of-networks are accounted for\u2014before we even get reimbursed , I can \u2019 t quite believe the statements that are out there about how there \u2019 s just not a constituency for further reform . Again , we have pretty good insurance . We are pretty healthy and don \u2019 t have out-of-the-ordinary needs . We are comparatively well off and highly educated . Yet there \u2019 s an inordinate hassle of time , and in the end a lot of costs we have to absorb ourselves ( and a tremendous amount of confusion , despite my PhD , about how those costs get calculated and distributed ) , which I find maddening ( and expensive ! ) Am I just that sui generis ? Or is it that the academic and media discourse is so focused on a certain kind of aggregate data that it ignores that there are huge costs that are being shouldered by individuals\u2014and that if there were political leadership that could really speak to those costs , there might be more of a constituency than we realize ? What I take Sanders to be doing is making these individual costs a public or political problem ; what I see mostly happening in the discussion is a shuffling off of those costs onto the individual so that they simply disappear from the political calculus . It \u2019 s a classic issue of politics : one side ( a very small side , it seems ) wants to make what is personal and individual into something public and political , while another side\u2014 including , it seems , a lot of reformers\u2014tends to escort those personal and individual experiences off into the shadows . What I \u2019 m saying here doesn \u2019 t confront , I recognize , the reality of the institutional intransigence of those who are opposed to reform . That \u2019 s a separate issue . But when I hear that Obamacare has solved this problem for 90 % of the population , and I think that my family is up there in the relatively well off sector of that population yet experiences significant costs and burdens that we find very hard to shoulder and understand\u2014well , I just wonder if we \u2019 re really seeing this reality whole .\nI was building here on an old theme of mine : the immense and shitty hassle of everyday life that is life in contemporary capitalism . I wrote about that in Jacobin a few years ago .\nIn the neoliberal utopia , all of us are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time keeping track of each and every facet of our economic lives\u2026.We saw a version of it during the debate on Obama \u2019 s healthcare plan . I distinctly remember , though now I can \u2019 t find it , one of those healthcare whiz kids \u2014 maybe it was Ezra Klein \u2014 tittering on about the nifty economics and cool visuals of Obama \u2019 s plan : how you could go to the web , check out the exchange , compare this little interstice of one plan with that little interstice of another , and how great it all was because it was just so fucking complicated . I thought to myself : you \u2019 re either very young or an academic . And since I \u2019 m an academic , and could only experience vertigo upon looking at all those blasted graphs and charts , I decided whoever it was , was very young . Only someone in their twenties \u2014 whipsmart enough to master an inordinately complicated law without having to make real use of it \u2014 could look up at that Everest of words and numbers and say : Yes ! There \u2019 s freedom !\nThis has nothing to do with the election , but what the hell ?\nI did manage , when I wasn \u2019 t tearing my hair out or having an aneurism over the campaign commentary , to read a lot of Clarence Thomas and secondary work on commercial speech . And it struck me in reading all this material that Citizens United and campaign finance law may be a massive sideshow to the real drama around money/speech that \u2019 s occurring in conservative jurisprudential circles . Conservatives aim , it seems , to use the First Amendment to strike down entire economic regulatory regimes at the state and federal levels . On the grounds that so much of commercial life is a mode of speech , which should be protected like other modes of speech . In one instance they struck down a licensing law in D.C. that required tour guides to be registered with the city : violation of free speech . Thomas is at the center of this , and it \u2019 s really unclear how far the conservatives on the Court will be willing to go . It raises some fascinating questions because the connection between money and speech\u2014as I \u2019 m discovering in this excellent dissertation I \u2019 ve been reading\u2014is an old and surprisingly complicated one in political theory , in which Aristotle and Locke play critical roles . ( Locke \u2019 s pamphlet against the devaluation of the pound may have been , according to this author , the single most influential writing he did up until the 19th century . ) Anyway , lots going on in this arena , which we should all be paying more attention to .",
    "content_original": "For the last two weeks or so, I have been trying to stay focused on my work on Clarence Thomas, but all the liberal commentary on the Democratic primary has gotten me so irritated that I keep finding myself back on social media, posting, tweeting, commenting and the like. So I figured I\u2019d bring everything that I\u2019ve been saying about the election campaign there, here. In no particular order. And with no effort to be scholarly or scientific. Just my random observations and musings\u2026\n\n1. Clintonite McCarthyism\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAccording to the Guardian:\n\nThe dossier, prepared by opponents of Sanders and passed on to the Guardian by a source who would only agree to be identified as \u201ca Democrat\u201d, alleges that Sanders \u201csympathized with the USSR during the Cold War\u201d because he went on a trip there to visit a twinned city while he was mayor of Burlington. Similar \u201cassociations with communism\u201d in Cuba are catalogued alongside a list of quotes about countries ranging from China to Nicaragua in a way that supporters regard as bordering on the McCarthyite rather than fairly reflecting his views.\n\nThis is becoming a straight-up rerun of the 1948 campaign against Henry Wallace. Except that Clinton is running well to the right of Truman and even, in some respects, Dewey. It seems as if Clinton is campaigning for the vote of my Grandpa Nat. There\u2019s only one problem with this strategy: He\u2019s been dead for nearly a quarter-century.\n\nAs was true of McCarthyism, it\u2019s not really Sanders\u2019 communism or his socialism that has got today\u2019s McCarthyites in the Democratic Party worried; it\u2019s actually his liberalism. As this article in the Times makes clear:\n\n\u201cSome third party will say, \u2018This is what the first ad of the general election is going to look like,\u2019\u201d said James Carville, the longtime Clinton adviser, envisioning a commercial savaging Mr. Sanders for supporting tax increases and single-payer health care. \u201cOnce you get the nomination, they are not going to play nice.\u201d \u2026 A Sanders-led ticket generates two sets of fears among Clinton supporters: that other Democratic candidates could be linked to his staunchly liberal views, particularly his call to raise taxes, even on middle-class families, to help finance his universal health care plan; and that more mainstream Democrats would have to answer to voters uneasy about what it means to be a European-style social democrat.\n\nRaising taxes to pay for popular social programs: That used to be the bread and butter of the Democratic Party liberalism. Now it\u2019s socialism. And that\u2014now it\u2019s socialism\u2014used to be the bread and butter of Republican Party revanchism. Now it\u2019s Democratic Party liberalism.\n\n2. Clinton\u2019s \u201cFirewall\u201d\n\nThe new line of argument against Sanders winning the nomination is that African American voters are Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall,\u201d which will engulf the Sanders campaign once it heads South.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere have been God knows how many articles making this claim over the last two days, celebrating the Clintons\u2019 deep and storied relations with the black community\u2014how, whatever the Clintons\u2019 policy positions (support for mass incarceration, welfare reform, etc.), both Hillary and Bill do the kind of retail and symbolic politics that black voters care most about. (I\u2019ll note in passing but not comment on the patronizing condescension of this position). And that we\u2019ll see all of this come into play after Iowa, when the campaign heads to South Carolina.\n\nIt could be true.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut first let\u2019s go to the Wayback Machine and see how black leaders in South Carolina responded in 2008 the last time the Clintons worked their magic there:\n\nBlack leaders widely criticized Mr. Clinton after he equated the eventual victory of Mr. Obama in the South Carolina primary in January to that of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the 1988 caucus, a parallel that many took as an effort to diminish Mr. Obama\u2019s success in the campaign\u2026.In an interview with The New York Times late Thursday, Mr. Clyburn [3rd ranking Democrat in the US House of Representatives] said Mr. Clinton\u2019s conduct in this campaign had caused what might be an irreparable breach between Mr. Clinton and an African-American constituency that once revered him.\n\nSpeaking of Jim Clyburn and South Carolina, he was on NBC recently, talking about Clinton\u2019s firewall in 2016. Start listening at 2:30, where he says that if Sanders wins by ten points in Iowa, that firewall could disappear very quickly. As it did in 2008.\n\nAnd lo and behold: According to a poll released last week, support for Clinton in South Carolina is plummeting. Back in December, Clinton had a 36-point lead over Sanders. As of last week, that lead has been cut nearly in half. Forty-seven percent of Democratic voters now favor Clinton; 28% favor Sanders. That\u2019s still a lot of support for Clinton, but it\u2019s considerably smaller than in December, when she had 67% of the vote.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNow it\u2019s true that Sanders hasn\u2019t gotten those defectors from Clinton. What seems to have happened is that a significant chunk of her supporters are reconsidering their support (Sanders\u2019s support is nearly what it was in December). Which could mean many things. One possibility is that voters are waiting to see what happens in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Sanders is doing well.\n\nBut the most interesting part of the polls is the racial and gender breakdown of the vote: Clinton is losing a higher percentage of her black supporters than of her white supporters, and Sanders is making greater gains among women than among men.\n\nOn December 17, this is how the polls looked (see the thirteenth page, which is labeled page six):\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOn January 22 (the poll was actually concluded on the 15th), this is how the polls looked:\n\nBetween December and January, we see major drops in support for Clinton among all categories of voters. But there\u2019s a greater drop among black voters (30%) than among white voters (24% drop). There\u2019s also a virtually identical drop among male (36%) and female (34%) voters.\n\nSanders\u2019s support among black voters remains practically the same as it was in December (he sees a tiny drop among white voters). But more interesting is that while he\u2019s made gains among both male and female voters, the gains among women (28%) are much greater than among men (13%).\n\n3. Sister Souljah Moment Remember Sister Souljah? In 1992, Bill Clinton chose to go after her as a signal to white voters that he and the Democrats were no longer beholden to black voters. It was a signature moment not only for him but also for the Democratic Party: They weren\u2019t going to be the party of quotas, welfare and black people. Which makes the claim that Sanders is bad\u2014and Clinton is great\u2014on race all the more galling. Have we forgotten everything? Well, there\u2019s one figure in the United States today who hasn\u2019t: Sister Souljah. Back in November, she spoke out against Clinton\u2019s campaign. 4. A Little Nutty and a Little Slutty Speaking of forgetting everything: David Brock, the man who called Anita Hill \u201ca little bit nutty and a little bit slutty,\u201d now says \u201cblack lives don\u2019t matter much to Bernie Sanders.\u201d Brock is described here as \u201ca top Clinton ally\u201d who \u201cruns several super PACs aiding her candidacy.\u201d Only in this country could such a charlatan make these sorts of claims and get away with it. 5. Dissolve the People, Elect Another As Sanders surges in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire\u2014opening up an 8-point lead in Iowa and a 27-point lead in New Hampshire\u2014and the pundits and party elites get squirmier and squirmier about his possible victory, I\u2019m reminded of this line from Brecht: Would it not be easier\n\nIn that case for the government\n\nTo dissolve the people\n\nAnd elect another? 6. First They Came For\u2026\n\nFirst they came for the Revolution and I did not speak out because I was not a Revolution. Then they came for the Parliamentary Socialism and I did not speak out because I was not a Parliamentary Socialism. Then they came for the Third Party and I did not speak out because I was not a Third Party. Then they came for the Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party and I did not speak out because I was not a Democratic Wing of the Democratic Party. Then they came for the Green Lantern and I did not speak out because I was not a Green Lantern. Then they came for me but that was cool because I\u2019m a Democrat.\n\n7. Camera Obscura Speaking of German writers, in \"The German Ideology,\" Marx wrote, \u201cIn all ideology men and their circumstances appear upside-down as in a camera obscura.\u201d I was reminded of that quote when I stumbled across this story from the summer. Back in July, while everyone was touting Clinton\u2019s sensitivity and deftness (and Sanders\u2019 insensitivity and tone-deafness) around issues of mass incarceration and Black Lives Matter, this little tidbit was reported in the Intercept. And completely ignored: Lobbyists for two major prison companies are serving as top fundraisers for Hillary Clinton\u2026.Richard Sullivan, of the lobbying firm Capitol Counsel, is a bundler for the Clinton campaign, bringing in $44,859 in contributions in a few short months. Sullivan is also a registered lobbyist for the Geo Group, a company that operates a number of jails, including immigrant detention centers, for profit. As we reported yesterday, fully five Clinton bundlers work for the lobbying and law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. Corrections Corporation of America, the largest private prison company in America, paid Akin Gump $240,000 in lobbying fees last year. The firm also serves as a law firm for the prison giant, representing the company in court\u2026.The Geo Group, in a disclosure statement for its investors, notes that its business could be \u201cadversely affected by changes in existing criminal or immigration laws, crime rates in jurisdictions in which we operate, the relaxation of criminal or immigration enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction, sentencing or deportation practices, and the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws or the loosening of immigration laws.\u201d Apparently, the new rule of American politics is: So long as you say the right thing, you can do anything. Postscript: In October, Clinton was forced to stop working with these clowns from the prison industrial complex. And return all the money. Sanders never had to return a dime. Because he never took a dime. 8. Reparations Sanders has gotten a lot of heat from the left for saying he\u2019s against reparations. It\u2019s a complicated issue, the substance of which I don\u2019t want to comment on here. Instead I\u2019ll just note that in 2008 another presidential candidate was asked about his position on reparations. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opposes offering reparations to the descendants of slaves, putting him at odds with some black groups and leaders.The man with a serious chance to become the nation\u2019s first black president argues that government should instead combat the legacy of slavery by improving schools, health care and the economy for all. \u201cI have said in the past \u2014 and I\u2019ll repeat again \u2014 that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed,\u201d the Illinois Democrat said recently. \u2026 \u201cLet\u2019s not be naive. Sen. Obama is running for president of the United States, and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life,\u201d said Kibibi Tyehimba, co-chair of theNational Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America. \u201cIn light of the demographics of this country, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic to expect him to do anything other than what he\u2019s done.\u201d But this is not a position Obama adopted just for the presidential campaign. He voiced the same concerns about reparations during his successful run for the Senate in 2004. I pointed this out on Twitter to Killer Mike, the rapper who\u2019s supporting Sanders. He retweeted me, which may be just about the biggest endorsement on Twitter I\u2019ve ever gotten. Except for that time Morgan Fairchild retweeted me. And that time John Cusack retweeted me. But who\u2019s counting? 9. The Establishment After Human Rights Campaign and Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton, Sanders said they were part of \u201cthe establishment.\u201d Clinton and her supporters made a big to-do of it. But this response from Garance Franke-Ruta was the most sublime: Bernie remarks a reminder how left economics & new social movements\u2014civil rights, women\u2019s rights, gay rights\u2014have always been uneasy allies \u2014 Garance Franke-Ruta (@thegarance) January 20, 2016\n\nNo, not really.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBack in 1985, that old dinosaur of a socialist Bernie Sanders was signing a Gay Pride Day Proclamation on the grounds that gay rights were civil rights.\n\nBack in the 1990s, while the Clintons were supporting DOMA and \"don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\" that old dinosaur of a socialist helped lead the opposition to both policies on the grounds that they were anti-gay.\n\nAnd throughout his career in the Senate, Sanders got consistently higher ratings from civil rights organizations than Clinton did while she was a senator.\n\nThe only thing this whole episode is a reminder of is how poorly journalists do their job.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSpeaking of the establishment, Clinton is now claiming that it\u2019s Sanders who\u2019s the establishment, while she is, I don\u2019t know what. Whatever she calls herself, I wonder what she calls this:\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign released a letter this week in which 10 foreign policy experts criticized her opponent Bernie Sanders\u2019 call for closer engagement with Iran and said Sanders had \u201cnot thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security.\u201dThe missive from the Clinton campaign was covered widely in the press, but what wasn\u2019t disclosed in the coverage is that fully half of the former State Department officials and ambassadors who signed the letter, and who are now backing Clinton, are now enmeshed in the military contracting establishment, which has benefited tremendously from escalating violence around the world, particularly in the Middle East. Here are some of the letter signatories\u2019 current employment positions that were not disclosed in the reporting of the letter: Former Assistant Defense Secretary Derek Chollet, former Pentagon and CIA Chief of Staff Jeremy Bash, and former Deputy National Security Adviser Julianne Smith are now employed by the consulting firm Beacon Global Strategies, a firm we profiled last year. Beacon Global Strategies\u2019 staff advises both Clinton and Republican candidates for president, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The firm makes money by providing advice to a clientele that is primarily military contractors. Beacon Global Strategies, however, has refused to disclose the identity of its clients. Former Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns is a senior counselor at the Cohen Group, a consulting firm founded by former Defense Secretary William Cohen. The firm \u201cassists aerospace and defense firms on policy, business development, and transactions,\u201d including deals in the U.S., Turkey, Israel, and the Middle East. Former Undersecretary of Defense Jim Miller is an advisory boardmember to Endgame Systems, a start-up that has been called the \u201cBlackwater of Hacking.\u201d Miller is also on the board of BEI Precision Systems & Space, a military contractor.\n\n10. Savant\n\nYou\u2019ll be hearing a lot in the coming weeks about what a political savant Hillary Clinton is\u2014and what a political naif Bernie Sanders is. You already have. On Sunday or Monday, I counted five such articles alone.\n\nHere\u2019s some information to consider when you hear that kind of talk:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nEven though the Clinton team has sought to convey that it has built a national operation, the campaign has invested much of its resources in the Feb. 1 caucuses in Iowa, hoping that a victory there could marginalize Mr. Sanders and set Mrs. Clinton on the path to the nomination. As much as 90 percent of the campaign\u2019s resources are now split between Iowa and the Brooklyn headquarters, according to an estimate provided by a person with direct knowledge of the spending. The campaign denied that figure. The campaign boasted last June, when Mrs. Clinton held her kickoff event on Roosevelt Island in New York, that it had at least one paid staff member in all 50 states. But the effort did not last, and the staff members were soon let go or reassigned\u2026.For all its institutional advantages, the Clinton campaign lags behind the Sanders operation in deploying paid staff members: For example, Mr. Sanders has campaign workers installed in all 11 of the states that vote on Super Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton does not.\n\nEven Bill Clinton is questioning the strategic wisdom of the Clinton campaign:\n\nBill Clinton is getting nervous.With polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire and barely behind, if at all, in Iowa, the former president is urging his wife to start looking toward the delegate-rich March primaries \u2014 a shift for an organizing strategy that\u2019s been laser-focused on the early states. Bill Clinton, according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation, has been phoning campaign manager Robby Mook almost daily to express concerns about the campaign\u2019s organization in the March voting states, which includes delegate bonanzas in Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Texas. Many Clinton allies share the president\u2019s desire for more organization on the ground; they see enthusiasm that\u2019s ready to be channeled, but no channel yet in place. \u201cIowa matters a ton, but it seems to be the campaign\u2019s only focus,\u201d said one person close to the campaign\u2019s operations in a March state \u2014 one of nearly a dozen Clinton allies with whom POLITICO spoke for this article. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long primary, and the campaign seems less prepared for it than they were in 2008.\u201d\n\n11. We Are All Socialists Now\n\nFrom the great state of Iowa:\n\nLittle noticed in this week\u2019s Des Moines Register-Bloomberg Politics Iowa poll was this finding: a remarkable 43 percent of likely Democratic caucus participants describe themselves as socialists, including 58 percent of Sanders\u2019s supporters and about a third of Clinton\u2019s.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Iowa:\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders\u2019s speech on Thursday explaining his democratic socialist ideology carried little risk among supporters and other Democrats: A solid majority of them have a positive impression of socialism, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this month. Fifty-six percent of those Democratic primary voters questioned said they felt positive about socialism as a governing philosophy, versus 29 percent who took a negative view.\n\n12. The Gender Gap\n\nAnother pundit trope is that Sanders is not popular among women. There is a gender gap in this primary, in fact, but it\u2019s not only the one you may have heard about. According to the latest USA Today poll:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere is a gender gap as well \u2014 and not the one that favors Clinton among baby boomer women. Men under 35 support Sanders by 4 percentage points. Women back him by almost 20 points. The possibility of breaking new ground by electing the first female president apparently carries less persuasive power among younger women than their mothers\u2019 generation.Stone is ready to support Clinton, though she prefers Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019s actually talking about breaking up the big banks and helping income inequality,\u201d she says, \u201cand given that I\u2019m currently unemployed, income inequality is pretty important.\u201d\n\nA fact that apparently has caught the Clinton campaign completely off-guard:\n\nMrs. Clinton and her team say they always anticipated the race would tighten, with campaign manager Robby Mook telling colleagues last spring that Mr. Sanders would be tough competition. Yet they were not prepared for Mr. Sanders to become so popular with young people and independents, especially women, whom Mrs. Clinton views as a key part of her base.\n\n13. Chelsea Mourning\n\nChelsea Clinton, who lives in a Gramercy Park apartment that she and her husband bought three years ago for $10.5 million, says:\n\nI was curious if I could care about (money) on some fundamental level, and I couldn\u2019t.\n\nReminds me of that old joke: One fish asks another, \u201cHow\u2019s the water?\u201d The other replies, \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d\n\n14. The Immense and Shitty Hassle of Everyday Life Under Capitalism\u2026\n\nArin Dube launched an interesting discussion on his Facebook page the other day. Riffing off of a bunch of Paul Krugman\u2019s posts, which are fairly critical of Sanders\u2019 healthcare plans, Arin wondered whether Sanders\u2019 focus on single-payer, after all the drama and struggle over Obamacare and its achievements in terms of extended coverage, really makes political sense.\n\nThere are excellent arguments on all sides, and Arin\u2019s voice is always one that I listen to. But I posted this comment on his page because I have this nagging feeling that a lot of the discussion around healthcare and insurance in the media is missing a critical reality. I\u2019m posting it less as a definitive statement and more as an opening to see if my own intuitions and experiences track with those of others. I recognize that I really could be an outlier here, so feel free to tell me that I am. I just find it hard to believe that my experience of this system is so completely sui generis.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s an edited version of what I said:\n\nCan I speak to this less from the policy or political perspective or more from the individual perspective, as a way of getting to the political perspective?My family has insurance: I get mine from CUNY and my wife and daughter get theirs from my wife\u2019s employer. From what I can gather, we have decent insurance. Yet when I think about the mountains of time I have to spend dealing with health care and insurance\u2014the submission of forms, the resubmission of forms, haggling with the insurance companies to make sure things that should be covered are covered (or simply to make sure that forms are being processed at all), getting the doctor to revise forms b/c the diagnostic or procedure codes may not be correct or may have changed (which they do with alarming frequency, it seems)\u2014and the consistent surprises I experience about how much we still have to pay\u2014after the deductibles, the premiums, the co-pays, the out-of-networks are accounted for\u2014before we even get reimbursed, I can\u2019t quite believe the statements that are out there about how there\u2019s just not a constituency for further reform. Again, we have pretty good insurance. We are pretty healthy and don\u2019t have out-of-the-ordinary needs. We are comparatively well off and highly educated. Yet there\u2019s an inordinate hassle of time, and in the end a lot of costs we have to absorb ourselves (and a tremendous amount of confusion, despite my PhD, about how those costs get calculated and distributed), which I find maddening (and expensive!) Am I just that sui generis? Or is it that the academic and media discourse is so focused on a certain kind of aggregate data that it ignores that there are huge costs that are being shouldered by individuals\u2014and that if there were political leadership that could really speak to those costs, there might be more of a constituency than we realize? What I take Sanders to be doing is making these individual costs a public or political problem; what I see mostly happening in the discussion is a shuffling off of those costs onto the individual so that they simply disappear from the political calculus. It\u2019s a classic issue of politics: one side (a very small side, it seems) wants to make what is personal and individual into something public and political, while another side\u2014 including, it seems, a lot of reformers\u2014tends to escort those personal and individual experiences off into the shadows. What I\u2019m saying here doesn\u2019t confront, I recognize, the reality of the institutional intransigence of those who are opposed to reform. That\u2019s a separate issue. But when I hear that Obamacare has solved this problem for 90% of the population, and I think that my family is up there in the relatively well off sector of that population yet experiences significant costs and burdens that we find very hard to shoulder and understand\u2014well, I just wonder if we\u2019re really seeing this reality whole.\n\nI was building here on an old theme of mine: the immense and shitty hassle of everyday life that is life in contemporary capitalism. I wrote about that in Jacobin a few years ago.\n\nIn the neoliberal utopia, all of us are forced to spend an inordinate amount of time keeping track of each and every facet of our economic lives\u2026.We saw a version of it during the debate on Obama\u2019s healthcare plan. I distinctly remember, though now I can\u2019t find it, one of those healthcare whiz kids \u2014 maybe it was Ezra Klein \u2014 tittering on about the nifty economics and cool visuals of Obama\u2019s plan: how you could go to the web, check out the exchange, compare this little interstice of one plan with that little interstice of another, and how great it all was because it was just so fucking complicated. I thought to myself: you\u2019re either very young or an academic. And since I\u2019m an academic, and could only experience vertigo upon looking at all those blasted graphs and charts, I decided whoever it was, was very young. Only someone in their twenties \u2014 whipsmart enough to master an inordinately complicated law without having to make real use of it \u2014 could look up at that Everest of words and numbers and say: Yes! There\u2019s freedom!\n\n15. Clarence Thomas and Free Speech\n\nThis has nothing to do with the election, but what the hell?\n\nI did manage, when I wasn\u2019t tearing my hair out or having an aneurism over the campaign commentary, to read a lot of Clarence Thomas and secondary work on commercial speech. And it struck me in reading all this material that Citizens United and campaign finance law may be a massive sideshow to the real drama around money/speech that\u2019s occurring in conservative jurisprudential circles. Conservatives aim, it seems, to use the First Amendment to strike down entire economic regulatory regimes at the state and federal levels. On the grounds that so much of commercial life is a mode of speech, which should be protected like other modes of speech. In one instance they struck down a licensing law in D.C. that required tour guides to be registered with the city: violation of free speech. Thomas is at the center of this, and it\u2019s really unclear how far the conservatives on the Court will be willing to go. It raises some fascinating questions because the connection between money and speech\u2014as I\u2019m discovering in this excellent dissertation I\u2019ve been reading\u2014is an old and surprisingly complicated one in political theory, in which Aristotle and Locke play critical roles. (Locke\u2019s pamphlet against the devaluation of the pound may have been, according to this author, the single most influential writing he did up until the 19th century.) Anyway, lots going on in this arena, which we should all be paying more attention to.\n\n16. Politics Without Bannisters",
