''\nUnfortunately , the 355th shooting that involved four or more victims this year suggested that already may be the case : In 2015 , such occurrences have averaged more than one a day . In fact , the San Bernardino attack was Wednesday 's second mass shooting \u2013 the first was in Savannah , Georgia .\nThe immediate aftermath of the attack , which killed 14 people and injured 21 , took on a familiar script , from the political rhetoric of the gun control debate to what some called empty calls for \u201c thoughts and prayers. \u201d Those reactions have become familiar during a span of two years in America when not a calendar week has gone by without an act of mass gun violence .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve reached a critical saturation point with these mass shootings , and that \u2019 s part of the numbness and confusion we feel , \u201d says Ron Astor , a University of Southern California professor of social work who has studied mass violence for more than 30 years . \u201c But it \u2019 s not like we \u2019 ve accepted [ the level of violence ] . The problem is , we haven \u2019 t figured out what to do with that moral outrage that we all have . \u201d\nOverall gun violence has declined , along with violent crime , over the past two decades . But the frequency with which mass shootings have been reported this year have led to perceptions that this one , particularly shocking , type of violence may be experiencing a surge . The question , which divides experts , is whether such shootings are , in fact , running above historical norms , or whether the public is simply more acutely aware of them , given the rise of social media and the 24-hour digital news cycle .\n\u201c The only increase has been in fear , and in the perception of an increase , \u201d says James Alan Fox , a criminologist at Northeastern University , told The New York Times .\nA lack of a common definition of what encompasses a mass incident complicates the ability of criminologists to reach a consensus on how much of an increase 2015 \u2019 s tally represents \u2013 or what the historical average for mass shootings has been .\nThe FBI , in a report last year , counted 160 \u201c active shooter \u201d situations between 2000 and 2013 , including the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut ; the Aurora , Colo. , theater shooting ; and the massacre at Fort Hood in Texas . Its findings suggested a steady increase in frequency , with a peak in 2010 of 26 .\nResearch by Harvard University suggests that the frequency of mass shootings has increased threefold since 2011 , based on a survey of news reports by the liberal-leaning Mother Jones magazine .
