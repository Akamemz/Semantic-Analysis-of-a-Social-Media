There are dozens of examples of that occurring . Some people , I think in particular the Clinton camp , might say these are all coincidence . I do n't think when you 're talking about 12 instances you 're talking coincidence , I think you 're talking trend , '' Schweizer said . `` If you look at a couple of recent examples , for example Governor McDonnell down in Virginia or you look at Senator Menendez , in these cases you did n't have evidence of a quid pro quo , what you had was funds flowing to elected officials , some of them gifts , some of them campaign contributions , and actions that were being taken by those public officials that seemed to benefit the contributors . Certainly I think it [ Clintons ] warrants investigation ... The evidence here is far more wide spread in terms of repeated action . ''\nNaturally Stephanopoulos , a strong Clinton ally , said ABC News has n't found any `` direct '' proof to show Clinton traded political favor for donations . It 's too bad Clinton erased 50,000 emails from her personal server .\nSchweizer also sat down on Fox News Sunday to talk about the book .",
