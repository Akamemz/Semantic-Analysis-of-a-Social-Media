    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump on Friday chose as his next attorney general William Barr , who served that role during the first Bush administration , settling on a veteran Republican who has long held sweeping views of presidential power to oversee the special counsel \u2019 s Russia investigation as it continues to roil the administration .\nMr. Barr , if confirmed by the Senate , would succeed acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker , who in earlier writings and television appearances had criticized the investigation into Russian election interference and any ties to Trump associates . Mr. Barr has also publicly criticized the investigation , meaning his confirmation hearings will likely be dominated by questions about how he would handle oversight of the probe .\n\u201c He was my first choice since day one , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters of Mr. Barr as he left Washington for Kansas City , Mo. , on Friday .\nMr. Barr , 68 years old , spent two years as attorney general under Republican President George H.W . Bush . One of the people who served under Mr. Barr during that time was Pat Cipollone , whom Mr. Trump named White House counsel in October .\nMr. Trump said that Mr. Barr , who has been counsel in the Washington office of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis , is \u201c respected by Republicans , respected by Democrats , \u201d adding that he hoped the nomination process \u201c will go very quickly . \u201d\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R. , Texas ) praised Mr. Barr as a \u201c very good choice \u201d earlier in the week and called him \u201c the kind of person who could get confirmed , \u201d but said of the confirmation process : \u201c It \u2019 s going to be challenging in any event . \u201d\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) on Friday said any attorney general nominated by Mr. Trump would face a \u201c steep hill to climb \u201d to confirmation . He called for Mr. Barr to commit to allowing the special counsel investigation to \u201c proceed unimpeded \u201d and to making public investigators \u2019 final report on the Russia probe \u201c immediately upon completion . \u201d\nJeff Sessions , whom Mr. Trump forced out a month ago , leading to Mr. Whitaker \u2019 s appointment , had recused himself from oversight of the special counsel \u2019 s probe , led by Robert Mueller . That recusal drew repeated broadsides by Mr. Trump , and Mr. Whitaker had faced calls to similarly recuse himself over his previous comments .\nThe special counsel \u2019 s probe , which Mr. Trump has repeatedly derided as a \u201c witch hunt , \u201d has led to guilty pleas or convictions involving several Trump 2016 campaign associates .\nIf confirmed as attorney general , Mr. Barr would likely espouse a similar crime-fighting agenda as the one he pushed the first time . As the nation \u2019 s top law-enforcement officer during the drug war in the early 1990s , Mr. Barr was known for tough policies on immigration and violent crime and for advocating more punitive criminal-justice laws\u2014which critics blamed for soaring prison populations and other social ills .\nHe ordered the transfer of agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration to \u201c violent crime \u201d duty from other assignments and promised to add new immigration agents to \u201c combat illegal immigration and violent crime by criminal aliens , \u201d among other rollouts .\nMr . Sessions pursued a similar agenda , even as the rate of violent crime in the U.S. is down sharply since the early 1990s .\nMr. Barr is a more conventional choice than some other candidates the president considered , according to advisers and people close to the White House , and would likely face better confirmation odds in the Senate . Stuart Gerson , who ran the Justice Department \u2019 s civil division under the first Bush administration and worked closely with Mr. Barr , said Mr. Barr was a \u201c dependable conservative \u201d with decades of experience in Washington , and he described the two of them , along with Mr. Mueller , as \u201c folks of the establishment . \u201d\nBesides investigating Russian election interference , Mr. Mueller is looking into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by , among other things , firing James Comey as FBI director in May 2017 , while the agency \u2019 s Russia probe was under way . Shortly after Mr. Comey \u2019 s firing , Mr. Barr wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post headlined : \u201c Trump made the right call on Comey . \u201d\nDemocrats are likely to seize on Mr. Barr \u2019 s criticism of the Russia probe . Still , Republicans will start the new Congress in January with a 53-47 majority in the Senate , so a conventional attorney general candidate like Mr. Barr will likely be approved and could be in office by February .\nMr. Barr has also called for \u201c more balance \u201d among the prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller , noting that some of them have made political contributions to Democrats . Mr. Mueller himself is a registered Republican . Mr. Barr also publicly supported Mr. Trump \u2019 s call last year for the Justice Department to investigate 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , saying there was \u201c nothing inherently wrong \u201d with such a call . Presidents typically avoid public calls for investigations to avoid the appearance of interfering with matters of justice .\nMr. Barr \u201c will deal with requests in an entirely appropriate way . The president is more than entitled to express his opinion where he believes it important to do so , \u201d said George Terwilliger , who served as deputy attorney general under Mr. Barr and praised Mr. Barr \u2019 s nomination . \u201c The president may have more confidence in the decision making at the department than he seemed to have prior to this . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t immediately clear what Mr. Barr \u2019 s nomination will mean for Mr. Whitaker , who associates said had been interested in the permanent position but knew he would face challenges being confirmed . Mr. Whitaker praised the nomination in remarks introducing the president Friday at the Kansas City event . \u201c Bill is supremely qualified , highly respected at the Department of Justice and will continue to support the women and men in blue . \u201d\nMr. Barr \u2019 s nomination also heightened doubts about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2019 s future in the department . Deputies often depart after a new attorney general is confirmed , giving the president an opportunity to replace Mr. Rosenstein after railing against him for months over his involvement in the Russia probe . Mr. Rosenstein told associates he was elated by the choice of Mr. Barr , who was deputy attorney general when he joined the department and was a kind of role model for Mr. Rosenstein .\nBoth Mr. Barr and Mr. Gerson worked closely with Mr. Mueller , who ran the Justice Department \u2019 s criminal division when they served in government . \u201c As far as his relationship with Bob Mueller , it was a cordial one , \u201d Mr. Gerson said .\nA former Central Intelligence Agency legislative aide , Mr. Barr worked as a staffer in the Reagan White House before leaving for private practice . He had risen to the highest echelons of the Justice Department even before becoming attorney general , leading its Office of Legal Counsel , where he wrote a series of secret legal opinions justifying the December 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama and the arrest by U.S. forces of Manuel Noriega .\nA strong proponent of executive-branch prerogatives , he also battled with Democratic lawmakers over a separate opinion broadening the FBI \u2019 s authority to detain terrorists abroad , without seeking the permission of foreign governments .
