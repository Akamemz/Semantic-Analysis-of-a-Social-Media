    "content": "At first glance , Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg 's decision to tackle foreign affairs and national security in his first major policy address was a head-scratcher .\nThe issue is n't among the top concerns listed by most voters and so seems unlikely to move his poll numbers significantly . But political watchers say Buttigieg , whose campaign has been praised early in the race for its media savvy , was smart to choose it over topics more pressing to most Americans , such as health care or the economy .\nThey think the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend used the hour-long treatise on foreign affairs last week to blunt criticism he 's too inexperienced to lead the United States , reinforcing his time as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan . In the days since , he 's been praised bothfor his thoughtful approach to intricate policy issues few candidates have addressed so far , and for delivering it at a place like Indiana University , outside the gaze of the political race .\nThe strategy likely bolstered his legitimacy among voters and donors who are still deciding whom to support in a crowded field , according to pundits , former politicians and political donors who spoke with IndyStar . He also saw a chance to set himself apart from a crowded field that 's largely ignored foreign affairs , they say .\nPolice shooting : Buttigieg cancels campaign events after fatal police shooting in South Bend\nOf the field of 24 Democratic candidates , only U.S. Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have so far delivered speeches on foreign policy .\nButtigieg clearly knew the subject , said Larry Sabato , a political science professor at the University of Virginia who watched the speech online . Still , he was taken by how `` boyish '' the mayor looked and suspected his age will be a nagging problem .\n`` A lot of people say he is just the mayor of South Bend and there is a big world out there , '' Sabato said . `` He is trying to show people that he knows there is a big world out there and he has a notion about how it should be run . ''\nButtigieg told reporters after the speech he hoped it bridged that gap for him .\n`` It 's important for people to understand the worldview that frames my work , '' he said . `` Rather than a record of congressional votes , I have a personal record , of course of serving ( in Afghanistan ) , coupled with a view of how America ought to operate in the world . ''\nCLOSE South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 by declaring that the country `` needs a fresh start . '' Dwight Adams and Vic Ryckaert , Indianapolis Star\n'The mayor of South Bend running for president kind of boggles the mind '\nCount Lee Hamilton , a former Democratic congressman from Indiana who introduced Buttigieg to the crowd of 1,850 at last week 's speech , among those surprised the mayor chose foreign affairs for his first major policy address . Hamilton made his bones in Congress as a deep thinker on foreign policy and is co-namesake of IU 's Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies .\n`` He \u2019 s very much aware that his experience level is limited in contrast to somebody like ( Joe ) Biden or Warren or Sanders , where they have a deeper and broader experience base , '' Hamilton said . `` Pete has a limited base . The mayor of South Bend running for president kind of boggles the mind a little . ''\nHamilton , who has n't yet backed a presidential candidate , found the speech well-researched and largely aligned with mainstream Democratic thought .\n`` He put a lot of emphasis on diplomacy and allies , '' Hamilton said . `` He advocated a combination of cooperation and confrontation with China , with an emphasis on American values and goals . He was quite forceful in his criticism of ( President Donald ) Trump 's policies . ''\nHamilton thought Buttigieg did well at explaining how foreign policy can help Americans at home , something he said candidates do n't always do well .\nMore from Buttigieg : Being gay is 'not the only thing that defines me '\nThe young and the older : 4 decades separate 2020 's presidential candidates . Here 's what that looks like .\nFor instance , Buttigieg said that an unchecked China could dominate the world economy , hurting American interests and businesses . But he thinks tariffs are a 20th-century solution that wo n't work , a point reinforced by struggling Hoosier farmers who have told IndyStar the U.S. trade war with China is hurting their profits .\nHamilton played a larger role in Buttigieg 's Bloomington address than crowd warmer . Buttigieg 's campaign called him a few weeks back about delivering a speech at IU .\n`` I said 'do n't come here and give a political speech , ' `` Hamilton recalls . `` If you come here , this is a serious audience and a well-informed and sophisticated audience . Speak on policy , not a cheerleading speech for Democrats . And he stayed away from that , for the most part . ''\nButtigieg has leaned on a number of former Obama-era officials to develop his foreign policy platform , but experts say it sounded more like President Harry Truman , who famously fought the global spread of Soviet-style communism in the Cold War .\nDoug Wilson , who served as assistant defense secretary under President Barack Obama , has emerged as Buttigieg 's leading foreign affairs adviser . He 's credited with leading the Pentagon 's communications strategies in Iraq , Afghanistan , Iran and China . He 's also the first openly gay man confirmed by the Senate to a senior-level Pentagon position and played a role in the repeal of the military 's '' do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy .\nDuring his address , Buttigieg made a point of saying he would counter Russian interference in U.S. elections and the political and economic expansion of China with American Democratic capitalism values . Unlike Obama , who launched military action in at least seven countries , Buttigieg argued for U.S. military intervention only as a last resort , promising an end to `` endless wars . ''\nAfter the speech , Buttigieg told reporters he chose Bloomington for the speech because the heartland can think globally too .\n`` I think a lot of people envision various oak-paneled halls in the Capitol where they think about foreign policy , '' he said to reporters . `` But part of what I 'm trying to achieve and part of what I talked about in the speech is that foreign policy needs to come home and it also needs to include the voices of the heartland . ''\nButtigieg 's campaign did not respond to multiple email and phone messages for comment .\nPundits say the decision on location also was smart strategically . Buttigieg has been campaigning in Iowa , first up among the Democratic caucuses and primaries , but they say the speech would seem too political there .\nHe could have chosen a place such as California or New York , where he 's been aggressively campaigning and raising money . But in the most progressive college town in his home state , pundits say , he was sure to find a large and supportive crowd at an academic setting \u2013 which plays well in news clips .\n`` This was a sober setting for a sober topic , '' Sabato said , `` removed from the immediate politics of the day . ''\nButtigieg has told supporters he has raised $ 7 million in the first quarter and , according to multiple news reports , is poised to double that this quarter , which ends June 30 .\nSome donors who have been sitting on the sidelines think Buttigieg was wise to tackle foreign affairs early on . It 's clearly a perceived gap for Buttigieg , said Jeff Smulyan , a noted Democratic donor from Indianapolis .\nHe 's met with Buttigieg and finds the mayor thoughtful , but has n't yet decided which candidate to support . Smulyan thinks age and experience will be among the obstacles Buttigieg has to overcome . That being said , Smulyan thinks Democratic supporters who listen to Buttigieg will find him knowledgeable .\n`` I think ( contributors ) are looking for someone that resonates with their point of view in the world , but also clearly want to know 'Can this person break through ? ' '' Smulyan said . `` People are very pragmatic when it comes to writing checks . ''\nMoney is flowing into Buttigieg 's campaign , of course , so clearly some donors have heard enough .\nInfluential Chicago businessman and Democratic activist John Atkinson was one of Buttigieg 's early backers . Atkinson is an LGBT ally , he said , and so immediately donated to Buttigieg 's campaign this winter , because he felt it was important to have that voice in the conversation .\nBut as he learned more about Buttigieg , he decided to drive to South Bend to talk to him . Atkinson liked what he 's heard and has become a major financial backer , organizing several fundraisers in addition to personally donating . Once folks hear and learn about Buttigieg , Atkinson said , they want to get involved .\nAtkinson does n't think the foreign affairs address was a strategic move . He noted Buttigieg has a military background and said the mayor thinks how America approaches world affairs and national security is one of the most important issues facing the country , linked to climate change , domestic security and economic security .\nStill , he conceded the speech might help Buttigieg with Democratic activists unfamiliar with his campaign .\n`` I think he 's trying to make sure that he has got a well-framed rationale for becoming president , '' Atkinson said . `` If you are 37 and mayor of South Bend , people will question whether you can pass the commander in chief test . ''\nFormer Democratic congresswoman and Indiana gubernatorial candidate Jill Long Thompson , for whom Buttigieg once worked , thinks the decision to take on one of the more difficult and nuanced topics fits his character .\n`` It 's very reflective of who he is and how he thinks and understands issues in fine detail , but also broadly how different policy areas interrelate , '' she said . `` I think this international policy speech that he delivered at Indiana University fits very well with what his campaign should be doing . I think that he delivered that speech because it \u2019 s important to the country , he \u2019 s obviously a veteran and he \u2019 s very policy-oriented . I think this is just who he is .
