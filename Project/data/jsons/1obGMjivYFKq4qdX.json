    "content_original": "Over the weekend, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was eating at a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky when he was approached and harassed by a small cadre of angry hecklers. TMZ obtained a video of the apparent ringleader screaming at the GOP leader, \"why don't you get out of here? Why don't you leave the entire country?\" near the tail end of the confrontation. That shouting came after the man reportedly \"slammed his fists down on McConnell's table, grabbed his doggie bag and threw the food out the door of the restaurant,\" also berating the Senator for \"killing people with this views.\" Watch:\n\nUnmentioned in TMZ's story is the apparent reaction of most other diners at the establishment. Though one woman yelled \"ditch Mitch\" (it sounds like she was the one doing the filming, later announcing, \"I'm gonna sell [this] to TMZ\"), others stood up to the agitator. \"Leave him alone,\" someone shot back. \"Nobody cares,\" another chimed in, as the heckler carried on about his grievances.
