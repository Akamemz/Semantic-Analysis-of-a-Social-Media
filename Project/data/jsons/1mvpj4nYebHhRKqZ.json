    "content": "From a high-resolution photograph of Donald Trump \u2019 s printed-out remarks for his Thursday press conference , we know two things : the first is that Trump \u2019 s speech was printed out for him in a huge font and protected by a plastic page protector . The second was that the visible page of the speech was unmarked except in one place : Where the word \u201c Corona \u201d in \u201c Corona Virus \u201d ( two words ) had been crossed out with a Sharpie and replaced with a word in distinctive penmanship printed in all caps : CHINESE .\nIt was clear Trump had replaced the accepted shorthand for the COVID-19 virus with another that would blame another country for the pandemic while inflaming antipathy against the \u201c Chinese \u201d and ( because ethnic hatreds aren \u2019 t especially discerning ) Asians in general .\nThis was a new development . Trump had previously referred to the pandemic as \u201c the coronavirus. \u201d So what changed ? The answer is obvious : People familiar with Trump \u2019 s limited but effective toolbox will recognize by now that the turn to racism is a sign of Trumpian distress . It means that Trump\u2014who hasn \u2019 t been able to hold rallies amid his adoring fans\u2014is feeling not just insecure but trapped . He thought the coronavirus was one more narrative he could control . He couldn \u2019 t . And so , perhaps sometime around March 16 , when he first used the phrase \u201c Chinese Virus \u201d on Twitter himself , it became clear that the president was ready to embrace an ugly construction Mike Pompeo and others had earlier tried to mainstream .\nThis xenophobic strategy is emerging because Trump , who handled the outbreak disastrously , is now engaged in a Herculean pivot toward a narrative that he takes the crisis seriously and always has . You can trace this lexical shift to that effort . During the many weeks Trump downplayed the epidemic and told Americans not to worry , he referred to the virus using perfectly conventional language . As recently as Feb. 22 , he tweeted , \u201c The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA , \u201d adding , \u201c Stock Market starting to look very good to me ! \u201d Earlier , on Jan. 22 , he was insisting to CNBC that the virus was \u201c totally under control . It \u2019 s one person coming in from China. \u201d ( As of this writing , the United States has nearly 20,000 confirmed cases in what appears to be an exponential rise . ) A lot of people took Trump at his word , so they didn \u2019 t take protective measures . The government also failed to ramp up production of N95 masks , or hospital ventilators , or protective equipment . South Korea discovered its first case the same day the United States did , but while South Korea was testing 10,000 people a day in drive-throughs , for free , the United States was suffering an inexplicable test shortage . As late as March 9 , Trump was still trying to compare the coronavirus outbreak to the seasonal flu to make it seem like nothing Americans should worry about . \u201c So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu \u2026 At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus , with 22 deaths . Think about that ! \u201d\nOn Thursday , still in his first week of admitting the seriousness of the threat , Trump said , \u201c Nobody in their wildest dreams would have thought we would need tens of thousands of ventilators \u201d \u2014despite weeks of reporting and pleas from medical professionals that the country did not have nearly enough ventilators for the crisis . Americans have notoriously short memories , but even some Trump supporters can probably recall how egregiously and how recently Trump downplayed the danger . So out came the Sharpie pen . Time to pivot to the language of war . Time to find a target people can turn their ire on . Time for the \u201c Chinese virus . \u201d\nThis strategy of ramping up racism under duress\u2014developed by his former adviser Steve Bannon\u2014is as familiar as it is ugly . It gives Trump supporters not one but two exciting wars to get worked up about : one literal , one cultural . The former is stupid and psychologically transparent\u2014viruses aren \u2019 t combatants , but a \u201c wartime \u201d president brooks little dissent and his obvious and even disastrous mistakes are easily excused by a frightened populace unified against a hated enemy . Difficult though it may be to muster jingoistic fury at a virus , many Republicans are doing their level best . Some , like Sen. Tom Cotton , have tried to link the coronavirus \u2019 s \u201c villainy \u201d with China \u2019 s , falsely suggesting that China ( which has suffered the greatest losses ) had a hand in developing the virus and announcing that the U.S. would \u201c hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world. \u201d It \u2019 s perfectly true that China was less than forthcoming in the early stages of the pandemic . But it \u2019 s hard to feel superior about that when the United States was itself aggressively under-testing its citizens in part because the president himself expressed a disinclination to inflate the number of U.S. cases by , for example , letting sick American cruise passengers disembark on American soil .\nBut the second war , the culture war , is at least as important . It \u2019 s the war Trump knows he can use to win back any supporters who might have started to doubt him after he insisted for weeks that the virus was \u201c totally under control \u201d and \u201c like the flu \u201d and that the economy was \u201c great. \u201d The Democrats\u2014and the scientists who have been sounding the alarm , and the media Trump hates that has reported the truth about the virus \u2019 likely spread despite Trump \u2019 s lies to the contrary\u2014have the high ground on every axis that matters right now . The Democrats have been striving to protect Americans first while putting politics second ( see New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo \u2019 s tentative praise for the Trump administration after it began taking things seriously ) . Meanwhile , two Republican senators\u2014Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler\u2014appear to have misinformed their constituents , falsely reassuring them that the media was lying to them about the gravity of the situation , even as they privately dumped huge amounts of stock and invested in industries that would profit under a coronavirus pandemic .\nTrump , whose sole priority is his re-election , desperately needs to remind his supporters that the Democrats , scientists , and journalists who took the outbreak seriously from the start are still their enemies . He can achieve that easily enough ; all he has to do is reignite a debate over whether something he says is or is not racist . If Trump can make it look like the very people who took the pandemic seriously are now frivolously objecting to his nomenclature , maybe he can claw back any support that may have been waffling .\nRepublican lawmakers , as ever , support Trump \u2019 s messaging effort . John Cornyn defended the use of \u201c Chinese virus \u201d by saying things like , \u201c China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that , \u201d safe in the knowledge that this strategy is a win-win . If no one objects to appalling pronouncements like this one , his message lands . And if they do object , the offended parties will only bolster the Trumpist perspective that the enemies of the people prioritize political correctness over human lives . Look ! They \u2019 re talking about racism in the middle of a pandemic ! Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that he knew of an entire family that lost their jobs , and yet \u201c some people want to argue over what name we should use for the virus . \u201d\nThat calling COVID-19 the \u201c Chinese Virus \u201d is not just theoretically but materially harmful to Asian Americans should go without saying . And yet it must be said , even and especially in these desperate times when the more strategic countermove might be to ignore the bait . People of Asian descent have seen increased mistreatment since the outbreak began\u2014being yelled at , being beaten , their children attacked and their businesses boycotted . People stopped eating at Chinese restaurants . A fake flyer in Los Angeles purporting to be from the World Health Organization instructed people to avoid Asian-American\u2014not Chinese but Asian-American ! \u2014businesses . People are being openly racist to Asian journalists .

The fog of war lets you get away with incompetence and reversals .
