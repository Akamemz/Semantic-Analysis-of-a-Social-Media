They \u2019 d need to collaborate on any federal fix , but they \u2019 d also be angling for position in the next battle \u2013 over whether health-care policy would move toward saving Obamacare or replacing it .\nAnd in the process , both parties would be trying to avoid being blamed for any mess that ensues .\nWhat \u2019 s at stake in court isn \u2019 t the whole of Obamacare , but it is an important piece . In the King v. Burwell case , opponents of Obamacare allege that the law \u2019 s federal subsidies to help people buy insurance extend only to states that actively set up their own health-plan marketplaces under the law . ( They say a phrase in the law , about marketplaces \u201c established by the state , \u201d makes this clear . )\nBy some estimates , 7.5 million Americans in 34 states are at risk of losing their subsidies , because most states opted to rely on a federally created marketplace rather than establishing their own . For many individuals , not having subsidies would make the insurance unaffordable .\nPremiums could surge , meanwhile , for individuals who continue with health plans in those same states , because insurers would be struggling to make up for the loss of those subsidized payers .\nRepublicans , who now hold a majority in both branches of Congress , say they have a plan that can allow Americans to retain health coverage , even if the court rules against the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) as implemented by the Obama administration .\nBut much remains unclear . Will Republicans have the legislation ready in time for a possible June court ruling ? Will they have the votes to pass it in both House and Senate ? Will their plan really find a viable fix for people who lose subsidies ? And if the Republican-backed legislation differs with President Obama \u2019 s vision for the ACA , will the president sign it ?\n\u201c People do not deserve further disruption from this law , \u201d Sen. Orrin Hatch and two other Republican leaders wrote over the weekend in an opinion column in The Washington Post , asserting that their legislation can keep such a disruption from happening .\nMr. Obama would face his own political challenge from the case , which went before the Supreme Court for oral arguments Wednesday .\nIn a ruling that could come in June , he \u2019 d potentially be put in the position of having to make a public case for the 2010 law all over again , this time without a Democratic Congress at his side .\nAs president , he might be able to use the bully pulpit to grab the high ground and blame Republicans for insurance-market chaos .\nBut Republicans could put Obama on the spot by arguing that the law is unpopular and that the way forward is to chart a new course while offering a temporary fix for those thrown off the subsidies .\nSenator Hatch of Utah , joined by fellow Republicans Sen.
