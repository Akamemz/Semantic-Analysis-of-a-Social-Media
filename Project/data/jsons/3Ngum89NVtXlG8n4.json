    "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is using President Barack Obama 's campaign strategy rather than the one that got her husband , Bill Clinton , twice elected to the White House , The New York Times reports . That 's because the electorate has changed , former Clinton strategist James Carville told the Times . `` The highest-premium voter in '92 was a voter who would vote for one party some and for another party some , '' Carville said . `` Now the highest-premium voter is somebody with a high probability to vote for you and low probability to turn out . That \u2019 s the golden list . And that \u2019 s a humongous change in basic strategic doctrine . `` That shift means focusing on certain states where the party 's liberal base is strong , but perhaps not motivated to get to the polls , while ignoring more conservative states with a larger number of swing voters.That method worked for Obama , but is n't as effective as helping the party down ticket , something the former secretary of state and New York senator says she wants to do.It also alienates Americans who felt ignored during the campaign , making them feel they are not a part of the White House 's vision.Despite his two victories , that has been exactly what Obama has faced , and the Times said Clinton 's campaign staff seems little concerned with trying to avoid it . `` If you run a campaign trying to appeal to 60 to 70 percent of the electorate , you \u2019 re not going to run a very compelling campaign for the voters you need , '' said top Obama strategist David Plouffe , who also has worked informally with Hillary Clinton.Democrats in Congress are n't too optimistic of retaking control on Capitol Hill even if Clinton wins the White House .
