    "content": "Joe Biden signed the death warrant for his campaign last week , even if he doesn \u2019 t know it . The joint manifesto he released with Bernie Sanders is 110 pages of radical far-left policies \u2014 from a job-killing $ 2 trillion climate agenda to eliminating cash bail and dismantling border protection .\nIt betrays the working-class voters Biden claims to represent and destroys any pretense that he is a \u201c moderate . \u201d\nAs Sanders has boasted , Biden would be \u201c the most progressive president since FDR . \u201d\nWell-meaning people might stick their fingers in their ears and vote for Biden out of nostalgia for a Democratic Party that no longer exists or out of exhaustion at the relentless anti-Trump barrage .\nBut with his \u201c Unity Task Forces \u201d document , Biden has proven only that he is an empty husk . Old Joe , who was for police and working people and law and order , is long gone . His body is there but , like his party , it has been invaded by the socialist left .\nUnder Biden \u2019 s manifesto , \u201c Climate change is a global emergency \u201d which requires \u201c decarbonizing \u201d American industries and eliminating carbon dioxide emissions to \u201c net zero . \u201d\nIt will eliminate fossil fuel power by 2035 , aka \u201c commit to eliminating carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 . \u201d\nWithin five years , \u201c we will install 500 million solar panels , including eight million solar roofs and community solar energy systems , and 60,000 made-in-America wind turbines . \u201d\nNote there \u2019 s no mention of \u201c made-in-America \u201d solar panels . The only way to install 500 million solar panels in five years is to buy them from China . In other countries , such as Australia , which have gone down this path , the result is cheap , shoddy solar systems that fall apart within five years .\nOf course , we will have to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement , and pay the Green Climate Fund , the United Nations slush fund which gives grants to China , even though China doesn \u2019 t contribute a cent .\nThis is a straight transfer of American taxpayer funds to the Chinese Communist Party . Way to go , Joe .\nHilariously , the document claims this will all result in lower electricity bills .\nIt \u2019 s a fantasy . America \u2019 s prosperity has been built on cheap fossil fuel energy . That will end with Biden \u2019 s plan . Where will baseload power come from when the sun doesn \u2019 t shine and the wind doesn \u2019 t blow ?\nAlmost two-thirds of our electricity comes from fossil fuels and the experience of countries such as Australia and Germany is that switching to wind and solar drives up the cost of electricity .\nTake California , which has mandated zero emissions by 2045 . Electricity prices there are 60 percent more , on average , than in the rest of the United States and rose five times faster between 2011 and 2017 , according to a study by Environmental Progress .\nNaturally , the nation \u2019 s most radical green groups are cock-a-hoop about the Biden-Sanders manifesto .\nThe word \u201c union \u201d appears 49 times in the document and \u201c working families \u201d 17 times , as Biden pretends that high-paying fossil fuel jobs and pensions in places such as Pennsylvania and Ohio will be magically transformed into new climate jobs , building wind turbines and electric cars and climate-retrofitting 4 million homes .\nTo pay for all this , Biden promises to increase taxes . At least he \u2019 s honest about it .\nHe \u2019 ll hike the top income-tax rate by almost two points and the corporate tax rate by seven points , undoing the engine that kickstarted Trump \u2019 s economy .\nIn other words , he plans to punish the wealth creators and redistribute their money to an ever-expanding class of supplicants . Not that it will be enough .\nThere \u2019 s a lot more to fear in the 50,000-word manifesto .\nBiden will abandon school choice and eliminate or hobble charter schools . That fits with his comments in May to an MSNBC public education forum when he said , \u201c Charter schools are gone . \u201d\nHe will also \u201c eliminate high-stakes standardized tests that unfairly label students . \u201d\nCrime , too , will follow the de Blasio model which has been so successful in driving up crime rates in New York .\n\u201c Eliminating the use of cash bail \u201d tops the list , along with \u201c decriminalize marijuana use . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s campaign vehemently denies that he supports defunding the police . But in an interview with activist Ady Barkan on digital media site NowThis News last week he said , \u201c Yes , absolutely , \u201d when asked if \u201c we can redirect some of the [ police ] funding ? \u201d\nRedirecting \u201c some \u201d funding away from police is a euphemism for defunding police , at least partially .\nIt tells you he has common cause with the anti-cop wreckers . So does the fact a Biden campaign staffer derided police as worse than \u201c pigs \u201d in tweets which also used the hashtag # Defundpolice .\nBiden speaks out of both sides of his mouth on fracking , too . He said during a debate in April that he would ban oil and gas fracking , which accounts for 10 million jobs and has catapulted America to the top world producer .\nBut his manifesto will ban fracking on \u201c federal lands and waters. \u201d The Institute for Energy Research says the policy will reduce revenues by $ 6 billion nationally over the next 15 years and eliminate 270,000 US jobs .\nThe biggest clue to the destructive ideology that drives the Biden-Sanders manifesto is the word \u201c equity , \u201d which appears 34 times .\nEquity means equality of outcome , not equality of opportunity . It is the very DNA of Marxism and everything bad flows from it , as we saw in the Soviet Union , Mao \u2019 s China , North Korea , Cuba and Venezuela .\nThis is not a path to electoral success . The Democrats are following the same road to oblivion as Australia \u2019 s Labor party and the UK \u2019 s Labour Party did last year , with similar agendas .\nNo matter how many New York Times columnists try to craft Biden an image as \u201c working class Joe \u201d from Scranton , \u201c a man who is not ideological , \u201d or dream up excuses for him not to debate President Trump , the charade is unsustainable .\nCongratulations to Mayor de Blasio for turning a patch of Fifth Avenue into a lightning rod for disharmony .\nSaturday a woman yelling , \u201c Refund the police , \u201d threw a bucket of black paint on his yellow BLM \u201c mural \u201d outside Trump Tower , the second paint attack in a week .\n\u201c You wan na defund the police for black people ? \u201d shouted Bevelyn Beatty , as police dutifully tried to stop her smearing the paint . \u201c We want our police !
