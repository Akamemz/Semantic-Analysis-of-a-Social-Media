( AP Photo/Mary Altaffer )\nNEW YORK ( AP ) \u2014 New York rushed to bring in an army of medical volunteers Wednesday as the statewide death toll from the coronavirus doubled in 72 hours to more than 1,900 and the wail of ambulances in the otherwise eerily quiet streets of the city became the heartbreaking soundtrack of the crisis .\nAs hot spots flared around the U.S. in places like New Orleans and Southern California , the nation \u2019 s biggest city was the hardest hit of them all , with bodies loaded onto refrigerated morgue trucks by gurney and forklift outside overwhelmed hospitals , in full view of passing motorists .\n\u201d It \u2019 s like a battlefield behind your home , \u201d said 33-year-old Emma Sorza , who could hear the sirens from severely swamped Elmhurst Hospital in Queens .\n\u201c How does it end ? And people want answers , \u201d New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo said . \u201c I want answers . The answer is nobody knows for sure . \u201d\nPresident Donald Trump acknowledged that the federal stockpile is nearly depleted of personal protective equipment used by doctors and nurses and warned of trying times to come .\n\u201c Difficult days are ahead for our nation , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re going to have a couple of weeks , starting pretty much now , but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific . \u201d\nScientists offered more evidence Wednesday that the coronavirus can be spread by seemingly healthy people who show no clear symptoms , leading the U.S. government to issue new guidance warning that anyone exposed to the disease can be considered a potential carrier .\nStocks tumbled on Wall Street and markets around the world , a day after the White House warned Americans to brace for 100,000 to 240,000 deaths projected in the U.S. before the crisis is over .

It \u2019 s hard when you have to tell the family members : \u2018 I \u2019 m sorry , but we did everything that we could , \u2019 \u201d said nurse Katherine Ramos of Cape Coral , Florida , who has been working at New York Presbyterian Hospital . \u201c It \u2019 s even harder when we really don \u2019 t have the time to mourn , the time to talk about this . \u201d\nTo ease the crushing caseload , the city \u2019 s paramedics have been told they shouldn \u2019 t take fatal heart attack victims to hospitals to have them pronounced dead . Patients have been transferred to the Albany area . A Navy hospital ship has docked in New York , the mammoth Javits Convention Center has been turned into a hospital , and the tennis center that hosts the U.S. Open is being converted to one , too .\nOn near-lockdown , the normally bustling streets in the city of 8.6 million are empty , and sirens are no longer easily ignored as just urban background noise .\n\u201c After 9/11 , I remember we actually wanted to hear the sound of ambulances on our quiet streets because that meant there were survivors , but we didn \u2019 t hear those sounds , and it was heartbreaking . Today , I hear an ambulance on my strangely quiet street and my heart breaks , too , \u201d said 61-year-old Meg Gifford , a former Wall Streeter who lives on Manhattan \u2019 s Upper East Side .\nNearly 6,200 New York City police officers , or one-sixth of the department , were out sick Wednesday , including about 4,800 who reported flu-like systems , though it was not clear how many had the virus .\nCuomo said projections suggest the crisis in New York will peak at the end of April , with a high death rate continuing through July .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s cooperate to address that in New York because it \u2019 s going to be in your town tomorrow , \u201d he warned . \u201c If we learn how to do it right here \u2014 or learn how to do it the best we can , because there is no right , it \u2019 s only the best we can \u2014 then we can work cooperatively all across this country . \u201d\nIn Southern California , officials reported that at least 51 residents and six staff members at a nursing home east of Los Angeles have been infected and two have died .
