Indeed , this recent survey shows that 48 % of internet-using adults reported getting news from Facebook in the previous week , rivaling well-known news media organizations . New data released here support the notion that two of the most prominent social networking sites , Facebook and Twitter , function very differently as sources of political information .\nOverall , Facebook continues to have a much larger base of users than Twitter ( with 77 % of web-using adults on Facebook compared with just 21 % on Twitter ) . Vast majorities of both Facebook users ( 86 % ) and Twitter users ( 77 % ) see at least some political content , such as posts from friends , news organizations and political leaders , and links to news stories .
