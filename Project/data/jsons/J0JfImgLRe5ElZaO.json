That would include Alabama , where a federal judge has struck down the state 's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage , but put her ruling on hold pending the high court 's decision .\nOf the remaining 20 states , any that fought unsuccessfully to preserve marriage bans would not have much trouble resuming enforcement . `` That state can immediately start saying we 're going to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples going forward , '' said Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf .\nThat list might include Alaska , Arizona , Florida , Idaho , Indiana , Kansas , Montana , Nevada , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Utah , West Virginia , Wisconsin and Wyoming .\nOfficials in some of those states refused to comment on how they would respond , citing the ongoing Supreme Court case . `` I 'm just not going to speculate on what the court may or may not do , '' said Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback .\nThings might be different in California , Colorado , Oregon , Pennsylvania and Virginia because top elected officials did not contest lower-court rulings in favor of same-sex marriage .
