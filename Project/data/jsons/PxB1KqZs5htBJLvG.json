    "content": "I covered New York politics for 15 years , and I saw some awfully tense moments between the police and Democratic politicians . But there has never been anything remotely like the war the cops are waging right now against Mayor Bill de Blasio for the thought crime of saying something that was completely unremarkable and so obviously true that in other contexts we don \u2019 t even bat an eye when someone says it . And for that , the mayor has blood on his hands , as Patrolmen \u2019 s Benevolent Association head Pat Lynch said Saturday evening after the hideous assassinations of two NYPD officers ?\nLet \u2019 s rewind the tape here . On Dec. 3 , in the wake of the Staten Island grand jury \u2019 s refusal to indict in the case of the police homicide of Eric Garner , de Blasio gave a press conference at a Staten Island church . He spoke of the need to heal and so on , the usual politician \u2019 s rhetoric , and then he uttered these words :\nThis is profoundly personal for me . I was at the White House the other day , and the president of the United States turned to me , and he met Dante a few months ago , and he said that Dante reminded him of what he looked like as a teenager . And he said , I know you see this crisis through a very personal lens . I said to him I did . Because Chirlane and I have had to talk to Dante for years , about the dangers he may face . A good young man , a law-abiding young man , who would never think to do anything wrong , and yet , because of a history that still hangs over us , the dangers he may face\u2014we \u2019 ve had to literally train him , as families have all over this city for decades , in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him .\nDante de Blasio , as you surely know , is a mixed-race young man of 16 who looks black and sports a large , \u2019 70s-style afro . Does anyone seriously think that his father should not have told him what he did ? Come on . We all know the odds ( actually , we don \u2019 t , more on which later ) . We hear every prominent black man in America who has a son and who decides to talk about this publicly\u2014football players and actors and others\u2014say exactly the same thing . We \u2019 ve heard it hundreds of times . Are these men lying ? Are they paranoid weirdos ? Of course they aren \u2019 t . They are fathers , describing to the rest of us what I thought was a widely acknowledged reality .\nIs it somehow jarring to some people that the father who spoke these words is not black but white ? I bet that has something to do with it . Do we accept black fathers saying this , because we grant them the presumption of speaking from experience , which we don \u2019 t grant the white de Blasio ? This may be how human brains , or some of them , are wired . But it makes no sense . All you have to do is look at the kid and you \u2019 ll see what Hizzoner means .\nOr is it that it \u2019 s fine for de Blasio to talk however he wishes to his son , but that because he is the mayor and the leader of the police he should not have said so publicly , especially at a tense moment ? All right , this is slightly more understandable . But only slightly . Certainly , this response would be understandable and even justified if de Blasio had in fact attacked the police .
