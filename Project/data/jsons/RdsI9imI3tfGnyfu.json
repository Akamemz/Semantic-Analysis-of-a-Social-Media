''\nOne of Abrams ' complaints about the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election was that her opponent , then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp , used his position to strictly enforce laws that allow for the purging of voters from the rolls if the name on the application does not exactly match the name on the applicant 's government ID .\nShe also opposes stricter voter identification laws , some of which have been shown to disproportionately affect students , minorities , and the elderly because of the administrative burden that can prevent or discourage those voters in those demographics from obtaining government IDs .\nAfter deciding against a once-rumored presidential run in 2020 , Abrams has instead focused on her organization Fair Fight 2020 , which aims to `` expand democracy and ensure all voters have access to the polls .
