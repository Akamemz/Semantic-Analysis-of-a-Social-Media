    "content": "Putting solar power on rooftops is pretty labor-intensive . You need people to design and manufacture the panels . Then people to market the panels to homes and businesses . Then people to come and install them .\nThe US solar industry employed about 174,000 people in 2014\nThat 's a lot of jobs . Even though solar power provides just a tiny fraction of electricity in the United States \u2014 about 0.4 percent \u2014 the solar industry now employs roughly 174,000 people , according to a survey from the non-profit Solar Foundation . And the industry is expected to add another 36,000 jobs in 2015 , as rooftop installations keep rising at a rapid clip .\nTo put this in perspective , 174,000 is roughly comparable to the number of workers employed by the US coal industry , if you add up all the workers in coal mining ( about 80,000 ) , plus coal transportation and coal power plants . * * Yet coal still provides 39 percent of America 's electricity \u2014 far , far more than solar does .\nNow , mind you , this is n't a perfect comparison . Solar is still growing , which means there 's a lot of installation work , whereas no one 's building new coal plants in the US anymore . ( Quite the contrary , many older coal plants have been closing in recent years , thanks to stricter air-pollution rules and cheap natural gas . ) Still , it 's interesting to look at the two industries side-by-side .\nThere are a few different ways to look at the boom in solar jobs .\nFrom an employment perspective , it 's great . The US has been reeling from a brutal recession , and any source of new jobs is welcome . In 2014 , solar companies added positions 20 times faster than the rest of the economy . And these are relatively decent-paying jobs , with average wages around $ 20 to $ 24 per hour . About 55 percent were installation jobs , 19 percent were manufacturing , and 12 percent sales .\nSolar power is still far more labor-intensive than other sources\nA more pessimistic way to look at these numbers , however , is to point out that solar power looks like a relatively inefficient way of creating energy . As one 2012 University of Tennessee study found , it takes far more manpower to generate one megawatt-hour of electricity from solar than it does from any other energy source .\nAnd that 's not a good thing . If the world wants to avoid drastic global warming , we 'll need to replace dirtier sources of energy , like coal , with cleaner sources \u2014 solar , wind , nuclear , say \u2014 and fast . And the higher cost of solar is a real impediment to doing so . Here 's Michael Liebreich , head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance , making this point on Twitter :\n. @ scalinggreen Do clean energy boosters understand : boasts about how many jobs a technology `` creates '' also show how expensive it is . \u2014 Michael Liebreich ( @ MLiebreich ) January 14 , 2015\nIf anything , Liebreich added , a solar industry that created fewer jobs could be a positive development :\n. @ guyshrubsole Automated # PV plants , modern installation systems , self-cleaning glass ... That 's how you get cost down , not by carrying jobs . \u2014 Michael Liebreich ( @ MLiebreich ) January 14 , 2015\nThe more encouraging news is that , in some ways , this is already starting to happen . Analysts expect residential solar systems to keep getting cheaper through 2017 , thanks to reductions in `` balance of systems '' costs \u2014 things like installation , financing , engineering , and so on .\nOne example : As the solar market expands , word of mouth will spread , and it will become easier to find new customers without the need to hire as many people in sales . Solar power , in essence , is contagious . And that makes the industry more productive :\nIf power plants had to internalize all their social costs , clean energy would fare better\nThere 's another angle here : Solar is far more expensive than coal if you only look at the direct costs of producing electricity . But there are indirect social costs , too . Coal plants produce lots of pollution \u2014 soot , mercury , coal ash \u2014 that foul the air and water and make people sick . These costs do n't show up on electricity bills . Instead , they 're dumped on the broader public , in the former of shorter lives or higher hospital bills . Coal plants are also a major source of carbon-dioxide emissions , causing damage through global warming .\nIf power plants had to internalize all these social costs , then sources like wind , solar , or even nuclear power would be far more competitive \u2014 as this 2012 paper by economists Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney explained . ( One way to do that might be through a carbon tax on fossil fuels . )\nIn other words : It would be a major boon for clean energy if solar power keeps getting cheaper and less labor-intensive over time . But getting fossil-fuel users to pay for all the external costs they impose would also make a huge difference .\nAs the solar industry expands , will it have more clout ?\nFor years , many US politicians have opposed action on climate change or stricter regulations on air pollution . Often this opposition comes in the form of jobs talk : Obama is waging a `` war on coal '' and killing coal jobs . That worry is n't wholly unfounded . The combination of cheap natural gas and new air pollution regulations really is shrinking the coal industry . And , in areas like West Virginia or eastern Kentucky , that really does mean fewer jobs .\nAs the coal industry shrinks , its defenders cite jobs as a reason to protect it\nBut as the Solar Foundation 's report points to , measures to bolster cleaner energy are also creating jobs elsewhere . Over time , that may end up creating a bigger constituency for further clean-energy policies . A US solar industry that employs more people as the still-influential coal industry could have a lot more sway \u2014 in Washington and elsewhere .\nBut it 's still unclear how that will all play out . Right now , the solar industry is still growing rapidly thanks to a 30 percent federal tax credit for rooftop solar systems . But that tax credit is set to expire in 2016 unless Congress extends it in some shape or form . And if the credit does lapse , the solar boom is likely to slow ( though it probably wo n't stop entirely in states that are sunny and have high electricity costs , like California ) .\nIt 'll be worth watching how the solar industry deals with that over the next few years \u2014 and whether all those jobs translate into extra political clout or not .\n* * Note on numbers : Over at Climate Desk , Tim McDonnell argued that solar employs twice as many people as coal , although he 's only counting coal miners .

As Jonathan Adler pointed out on Twitter , my coal jobs numbers may be an undercount , since they do n't include people working on things like regulatory compliance . Fair enough .
