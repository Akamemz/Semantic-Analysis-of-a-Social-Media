    "content": "The only explanation for the lopsided coverage of the election by the political press so far is that , for some mysterious reason-defying logic , there 's a `` false equivalence '' at work . It 's become an almost throw-away phrase , bearing little weight these days . The political press certainly does n't take it too seriously , that 's for sure . We 're just gaming the refs , they say . Someone 's always bitching about the media , they say . Whatever helps them sleep at night , I suppose .\nNevertheless , according to what we 're observing online and via cable news , Hillary Clinton 's negatives appear eons more grievous than Donald Trump 's missteps , even though they 're not \u2014 and this disparity unfairly elevates Trump and his poll numbers . This is how elections are tilted toward despots and undisciplined strongmen . They 're legitimized and humanized despite their long menu of unprecedented gaffes , lies and treachery .\nFor some time now , I 've been attempting to define the specific differences in the political press ' coverage of Clinton and the coverage of Trump . There are several underlying factors at work here . But the broad stroke imbalance is specifically due to the fact that the news media is evaluating Clinton based on pre-2016 political rules , while Trump has been operating under his all-new 2016 political rules . And the press has mostly sanctioned those rules .\nPut another way : Clinton 's triumphs and gaffes are being observed and reported through what we 've all come to know as canon for presidential campaigns in the modern era . Candidates running for president , prior to the ascendance of Trump , have always been expected to do and say certain things in order to successfully participate .\nFor example , candidates are expected release their tax returns . They 're expected to speak using a particularly even-keeled tone of voice . They 're expected to hold a few press conferences along the way . They 're expected to shift to a more centrist posture for the general election . They 're expected to behave in a way that wo n't offend minorities and mainstream Americans alike .\nIf they deviate from any of these rules ( and there are many other rules and traditions ) they 're pilloried by cable news talkers and political reporters who are career motivated to feed dramatic beef to the ratings beast .\nMeanwhile , Trump has mostly rejected the rules , despite his recent embrace of teleprompters . As a matter of routine , he tramples the pre-2016 rules multiple times a day \u2014 not just minor glitches , but words and actions that , according to those rules , would have collapsed his numbers if not driven him out of the race entirely , as it has with so many candidates before .\nBut because he managed to win the nomination and is polling within the margin of error against Hillary , due to the existence of `` liberal media bias '' and the fact that the press desperately needs as much conflict and uncertainty as possible to remain competitive , he 's allowed to skate by without being held to the same pre-2016 rules as his opponents . That 's his opponents plural , including his Republican primary opponents who were also held to old-school , pre-2016 standards of behavior .\nClinton was almost universally criticized for failing to disclose her pneumonia diagnosis for two whole days . Her dizzy spell during the 9/11 commemoration ceremony was treated with `` Special Reports '' that broke into regular programming , with endless conga lines of political analysts rending garments over why , oh why she never tells them anything and whether her temporary illness would end her campaign and deliver the presidency to Trump .\nAs a direct consequence , Clinton 's numbers have continued to dip , while Trump 's numbers are undeservedly surging . Again , she 's been held to rules established in 2004 , 2008 and 2012 about health disclosures and transparency , even though she released full medical records 13 months ago no less , from reputable doctors in accordance with how all presidential candidates have done it in the modern era .\nImagine for a moment if Clinton adopted Trump 's behavior and crapped all over the pre-2016 rules upon which her campaign is being evaluated ? Cable news people could n't scramble to a television camera fast enough to declare her candidacy over . That would be the kind part . It 'd be quickly followed by Day 2 stories about how Clinton has lost her mind . Trump , on the other hand , gets away with this every damn day \u2014 literally .\nWhat about Trump ? Unlike Clinton , he 's yet to fully disclose his medical history ( or his tax returns ) . Instead , he initially released a letter from a kooky doctor who looks like a background character from `` The Simpsons . '' Both Trump and the doctor , Dr. Harold Bornstein , insisted that the obviously suspicious letter accurately described the Republican nominee 's medical condition , including the part about being `` the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency . '' Sorry , that 's total bullshit .\nMonths later , Dr. Bornstein confessed to NBC News that he wrote the letter in five minutes based on Trump 's directives while he waited outside in his limo . Making matters even worse , Trump released a second letter on Thursday , also composed by Dr. Bornstein , via the disreputable Dr. Oz television show ( another violation of pre-2016 rules ) , and predictably it was almost as bogus as the first one .\nTrump 's weight was reported as significantly lower than it actually is . Bornstein wrote that Trump weighs a relatively svelte 236 pounds , even though he appears to weigh closer to 300 . Likewise , Trump 's height jumped from 6 foot 2 to 6 foot 3 . It 's worth noting that according to the Centers For Disease Control , if Trump 's weight , 236 , is n't a lie , then a 6 foot 2 Trump would be categorized as `` obese '' by the CDC 's standards . But if he were to magically grow by an inch to 6 foot 3 , while remaining 236 pounds , then he slips into the less dire `` overweight '' classification . Convenient growth spurt for a 70-year-old man .\nAm I overthinking Trump 's numbers ? Maybe . But , hell , no one in the traditional political press is investigating it , despite Trump 's long history of brazen mendacity and his previous history with suspicious Bornstein letters . Mark Halperin is n't looking into it . Neither is Chris Cillizza , Andrea Mitchell or Jake Tapper .\nNo one 's asking how Trump grew by an inch . No one 's asking how a 70-year-old man \u2014 a man who eats fast food because , as he laughably told Dr. Oz , he `` knows what 's in it '' \u2014 has a prostate specific antigen number , 0.15 nanoliter/microliter , that 's remarkably lower than the lowest end of the normal range for a white man his age . ( The normal range for a man of Trump 's age is zero to 6.5 nanoliter/microliter . )\nWhy is Trump getting away with this , while Clinton 's health and transparency was scrutinized and concern trolled for the better part of a week ?\nThere are different rules . Indeed , the reaction to Hillary 's pneumonia and dehydration episode would be fine if Trump 's hinky medical reports , as well as his obesity and everything else , were discussed through the same prism and with the same level of urgency . But his disclosures , on top of the laundry list of horrible blurts and ludicrous statements , are barely if ever scrutinized by anyone outside of three or four liberal-leaning MSNBC hosts , as well as an array of liberal blogs and social media personalities , very few of which reach the eyeballs of undecided voters .\nWe 'd be more sympathetic to a `` both sides '' equivalence in political coverage if the press actually held both candidates to the same set of pre-2016 rules \u2014 rules that have been applied to every candidate in every election year until Trump arrived on the scene . In doing so , however , the press would have to accept and own that Trump is a far worse violator of the rules than nearly all other presidential candidates combined . And the view from the outside would be that Trump is called on the carpet significantly more often , thus incurring the wrath of Trump supporters who continue to insist there 's a liberal media bias .\nBut it 's the avoidance of those accusations by the press , combined with the demand for horserace drama , that 's forced it to unfairly and dangerously apply separate rules to each candidate , egregiously offering Trump far more latitude than previous contenders .\nTo paraphrase Jon Stewart , it 's hurting America .
