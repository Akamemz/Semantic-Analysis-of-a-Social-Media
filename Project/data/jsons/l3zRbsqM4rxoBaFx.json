But she has used the word \u201c deplorable \u201d to describe some of Trump \u2019 s rhetoric and last month said the Republican candidate is \u201c taking hate groups mainstream \u201d by turning alt-right websites with 11,000 views to ones with 11 million hits , a notion she repeated Friday night .\nBut using the quantifier \u201c half \u201d to describe some of his supporters crossed a new line , say critics . It was likened to the 2008 comment by Barack Obama claiming some Americans bitterly \u201c cling \u201d to guns and religion , and Mitt Romney \u2019 s 2012 statement that \u201c 47 percent \u201d of Americans can be written off as unapologetic welfare moochers .\nThe flap comes as Clinton \u2019 s polling lead , according to a Saturday report by the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project , continues to slide . According to that rolling online survey , the battleground states of Ohio and Florida are no longer considered likely wins for Clinton as Trump has managed to shore up support among white suburban voters . Clinton still has an 83 percent chance of winning the election by an average of 47 Electoral College votes , Reuters/Ipsos reports .\nStill , those polling shifts at least partly explain Clinton \u2019 s unusually strong assessment of some Trump supporters as part of an effort to let her potential voter base know what \u2019 s at stake , especially now that Trump has tapped into what she called some of America \u2019 s \u201c irredeemable \u201d impulses .\nThe harshening tone is part and parcel of one of the most polarized elections in recent history , where two widely disliked candidates are trying to shore up narrow bands of support .\nBut as Obama and Mr. Romney have found out , calling out any segment of Americans for national scorn is politically risky territory in a country built on the First Amendment right to speak one \u2019 s mind without fear .\n\u201c The fact is , if somebody tells us to shut up , we \u2019 re going to speak as loud as we can , \u201d says Michael Hill , the founder of the white nationalist League of the South . \u201c From her point of view , what Hillary has done is stupid [ by targeting Trump \u2019 s alt-right support ] , because she \u2019 s legitimizing these people in the minds of folks who may not have been aware that the alt-right existed .
