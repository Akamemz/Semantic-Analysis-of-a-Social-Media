    "content": "A top Obama campaign official is being accused of lying over what she knew about the man at the center of a damning super PAC ad tying his wife 's death to Mitt Romney .\nDeputy Campaign Manager Stephanie Cutter appeared on CNN Wednesday morning to say , among other things , that `` I do n't know the facts '' about the case of Joe Soptic , a steelworker who appeared in a controversial ad for the pro-Obama super-PAC Priorities USA . In the ad , Soptic , recounts how his wife died of cancer after he lost his health insurance when his plant was shuttered after a takeover by Bain Capital and other companies working with the private equity firm .\nCutter said she did n't know when Soptic 's wife fell ill , or about his health insurance .\nYet in May of this year , Cutter herself hosted a conference call in which Soptic detailed his case to reporters . During the call , as he did in the ad , Soptic explained how his wife fell ill after he lost his job , and how he lost his health insurance . The call took place as Soptic began appearing in Obama campaign ads , and was featured in a profile on the Obama campaign website .\nThe campaign profile listed Soptic as one of the `` faces of Romney economics . ''\nCutter was n't the only Obama campaign official caught up in the controversy .\n`` This is an ad by an entity that 's not controlled by campaign . I certainly do n't know the specifics of this man 's case , '' campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said on MSNBC . Another Obama campaign spokeswoman separately told reporters that the campaign had no knowledge of the family involved .\nSuper PACs and the presidential campaigns are technically separate organizations , or are supposed to be . Both presidential campaigns have in the past cited that separation whenever challenged on super PAC ads . Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt again stressed Wednesday , in response to the criticism , that `` we ca n't coordinate with super PACs and did n't produce '' the ad .\nIn an email to FoxNews.com , LaBolt also acknowledged the conference call but suggested that was beside the point . The email did not address the allegation that anybody had lied .\n`` Joe Soptic suffered when he lost his job in the aftermath of the GST Steel plant closing , and no one is denying that he discussed that when he appeared in a campaign advertisement and on a conference call . The important point here is that Mitt Romney 's campaign is based solely on his experience as a corporate buyout specialist , and while he has been quick to claim he created jobs , he refuses to accept responsibility for the jobs that were lost and workers that were impacted , '' he said .\nRomney 's campaign , after decrying the ad on Tuesday , accused Obama 's team Wednesday of flat-out `` lying '' about their familiarity with the case .\n`` President Obama and his campaign are willing to say and do anything to hide the President 's disappointing record . But they 're not entitled to repeatedly mislead voters , '' Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement Wednesday afternoon .\nSpeaking to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul also called the ad `` disgusting '' and `` despicable .
