And minutes after he stepped onto another stage here Wednesday night and began to speak to his raucous supporters , it was even more clear that the sojourn across the southern border , much like his campaign \u2019 s two weeks of gentle walkbacks , was a ruse \u2014 that Trump and his campaign had used Pe\u00f1a Nieto as a prop in an opening act that served only to set up an evening stemwinder . The farce was , in hindsight , clear even before Trump approached the mic , as two of his warm-up speakers , Rudy Giuliani and Jeff Sessions , donned Trump hats that read \u201c Make Mexico Great Again Also . \u201d\nTime after time , the crowd of more than 5,000 people , clad in red Trump hats and waving campaign signs , erupted unprompted into chants of \u201c Build the wall ! \u201d and \u201c Lock her up ! \u201d\nIn the Arizona desert , hours after he spoke of his affinity for the Mexican people and the shared priorities of the two neighboring countries , Trump railed for nearly 90 minutes about the many ways undocumented immigrants are hurting the country and harming Americans . He promised not just to build a border wall , but also to empower a massive new \u201c deportation task force \u201d of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to round them up .\n\u201c You can call it deported if you want . The press doesn \u2019 t like that term , \u201d Trump said . \u201c You can call it whatever the hell you want . They \u2019 re gone . \u201d\nHe reverted to the tough talk he was unable to muster on foreign soil just hours earlier about Mexico paying for the wall . Toward the end of his speech , he used the personal anecdotes of mothers whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants to further demonize \u201c illegals. \u201d He blamed the deaths of \u201c countless Americans \u201d on President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their immigration policies .\nA senior Clinton campaign adviser acknowledged that Trump \u2019 s daring Mexico gambit seemed effective and thus worrisome for a few hours Wednesday \u2014 until his speech a few hours later . \u201c Not worried anymore , \u201d the adviser said . \u201c The Nuremberg speech put all that statesman-like stuff away . \u201d\nRather than issuing a statement criticizing the speech , Clinton \u2019 s campaign sent reporters a collection of tweets praising it \u2014 from noted white supremacists like David Duke and conservative provocateur Ann Coulter .\nFor weeks , Trump had dithered on the issue that has defined his candidacy from the start , suggesting that the question of what to do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country was more difficult than he \u2019 d heretofore suggested as he vowed to send them all home . Kellyanne Conway , his newly hired campaign manager , praised his newfound recognition of the issue \u2019 s complexity ; and his inner circle of advisers grappled with how to better sell Trump \u2019 s tough policies to a general election audience .\nUltimately , however , Trump was seemingly attempting to sell a slightly softened position on deportations to the base that voted for him in the primaries largely because of that stance . Trump \u2019 s revived bombast and the 10-pronged list of immigration policy ideas were actually a clumsy effort to obscure the fact that he is no longer vowing to immediately deport every undocumented immigrant in the country illegally ( just as many as possible in a more gradual manner starting with 2 million who have criminal records ) .\n\u201c They \u2019 re going out fast , \u201d he said . \u201c Moving forward , we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever , and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings , if we even have to do that .\n\u201c We will terminate the Obama administration \u2019 s deadly , and it is deadly , nonenforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets , walk around , do whatever they want to do \u2014 crime all over the place . That \u2019 s over . That \u2019 s over , folks . That \u2019 s over . \u201d\nBut in trying so hard to present his proposals as a hardening of his position , he \u2019 s unlikely to accomplish the only real imperative of any policy speech delivered 69 days before an election \u2014 winning over unconverted general election voters . And Trump \u2019 s amped-up nativism , and his proposal to curb even legal immigration are likely to only harden the two blocs of ardently pro-Trump and never-Trump monoliths on opposite poles of this election .\nThe irony in Trump \u2019 s pre-Labor Day base play is that many of his supporters don \u2019 t need harsher rhetoric or unwavering policy positions to turn out for him in November . Many , in fact , don \u2019 t take his promises of deporting all undocumented immigrants or forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall all that literally .\n\u201c He \u2019 s never going to be able to get 11 million people out of the country , \u201d said Steve Hagely , a Trump supporter from ucson standing near the back of the crowd inside the cavernous , concrete-floored convention center . \u201c It \u2019 s just something he says . \u201d\nWhile screams and cheers answered Trump \u2019 s promise of a border wall , some supporters aren \u2019 t convinced that will actually happen either . \u201c How \u2019 s he going to really get them to pay for it ? \u201d said Brian Howe of Phoenix . \u201c I think what he \u2019 s saying is that America \u2019 s not going to get taken advantage of anymore . \u201d\nTrump spent his speech Wednesday night addressing those already converted to his cause , forgetting how easily most of them will forgive whatever small touches of moderation might creep into an otherwise hawkish policy platform .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s just trying to win , \u201d said Drew Hathcock , from Surprise . \u201c The people who are already with him , he \u2019 s not going to ever lose them .
