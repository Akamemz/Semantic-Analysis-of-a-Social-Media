    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c James Baldwin famously said , \u2018 I love America more than any other country in this world , and exactly for this reason , I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. \u2019 As immigrants , we often come to America because we love it more than the place we are leaving\u2026 We come to make a better life for ourselves , certainly , but also because we believe in the idea of America . Our optimism about what this nation can be is not naive , it 's aspirational and visionary . Among our masses lies the same fervor that our founding fathers brought here : a fervor for a democracy that represents our interests . When we run for office , the potential we have to make government work for all of us is one that true Americans welcome . Trump is afraid that we do not huddle in fear but stride in power . \u201d Sayu Bhojwani , CNN\nOthers counter , \u201c A politician accused of anti-Semitism . Someone who has been critical of the United States and its leaders , often in strong terms . Who advocates positions outside the American mainstream . Who swears . These characteristics , President Trump argues , are ones that contribute to his labeling Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) and several of her colleagues as \u2018 anti-USA , \u2019 as he did Tuesday morning . They are also characteristics that describe Trump\u2026 \u201c Omar has , in fact , been critical of U.S. politics . Earlier this month , The Washington Post reported on her unique approach to the country \u2019 s politics and culture , noting that she has offered criticism of her adopted country , which \u2018 had failed to live up to its founding ideals , a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants , refugees and minorities like her \u2019 \u2026 [ But ] Trump has his own track record of much more direct criticism of the United States . While Barack Obama was president , Trump declared that political correctness had led the United States to lose \u2018 all sense of direction or purpose. \u2019 That \u2018 our country and our \u2018 leaders \u2019 are getting dumber all the time. \u2019 That the country had become \u2018 stupid. \u2019 That the country had never looked \u2018 weaker or more pathetic \u2019 ... What has Ilhan Omar done that Donald Trump hasn \u2019 t ? \u201d Philip Bump , Washington Post\nSome argue , \u201c a great number of Americans in both parties have little sympathy for the Squad , and for all kinds of reasons , ranging from simple racism , Islamophobia and misogyny , to genuine policy disagreements , to unhappiness with the bigotry and insensitivity that members of the Squad have themselves sometimes displayed . Almost everyone has a reason to temper their support . Professional Republicans are silent because they fear their voters ; professional Democrats are still angry at the Squad for challenging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) . Many are inclined to declare a pox on both their houses\u2026 \u201c Unfortunately , we don \u2019 t have the luxury of equivocation . Trump has given us a binary choice : Either stand with American principles , which in this case means standing in defense of the Squad , or equivocate , which means standing with Trump and white nationalism\u2026 Our nation won \u2019 t be undermined by anything the Squad has said or done . It will be undermined if we don \u2019 t fight back against this assault on our universal principles . Disagree with the Squad , refute them , argue with them , vote against them . But also defend them. \u201d Robert Kagan , Washington Post\nRep. Ted Lieu ( D-CA ) writes , \u201c President Trump has often crossed the line of what constitutes decent behavior . But this time feels different , because he is now attacking legal immigration and U.S. citizenship . His statements on Sunday and since then imply that immigrants are somehow less loyal to our country , less American , and that we should \u2018 go back \u2019 or \u2018 leave \u2019 if we disagree with him\u2026 The suspicion that immigrants are not to be trusted or are unpatriotic is not just wrong ; it is un-American . And dangerous\u2026 \u201c The problem for the president is that many Americans are immigrants or have friends or family members who are immigrants . The American people continue to support newcomers . A Gallup poll last year found that 75 percent of Americans believe immigration is good for the country . The American people understand that what makes the nation great is not people \u2019 s bloodlines or how long ago their ancestors arrived here , but their character and belief in the Constitution. \u201d Ted Lieu , Washington Post\n\u201c At the core of the strategy is Trump \u2019 s consistent drumbeat of equating the white European immigrant experience with the American ideal , setting those on his side of the divide against the politically correct elites , outsiders , immigrants or nonwhites who he implies are unfairly threatening what is good about the country. \u201d Michael Scherer , Washington Post\n\u201c [ Trump has ] talked a lot about who shouldn \u2019 t be in America \u2026 Here are a few groups Trump has suggested should not be in the country . 1 . NFL players who protest during the national anthem\u2026 2 . Black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean\u2026 3 . Muslims who want to come here\u2026 One could argue that calling for elected representatives , all of whom are minorities , to go back to countries they aren \u2019 t actually from is more blatantly problematic than the previous examples . But they are certainly part of a pattern for Trump , setting a standard for removal he doesn \u2019 t seem to apply to white people. \u201d Eugene Scott , Washington Post\nThe right disapproves of Trump \u2019 s tweets but disagrees that they were racist , and criticizes comments made by the \u2018 squad \u2019 of progressive Democratic Congresswomen .\nThe right disapproves of Trump \u2019 s tweets but disagrees that they were racist , and criticizes comments made by the \u2018 squad \u2019 of progressive Democratic Congresswomen .\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s remarks about the four were misinformed and unseemly , coming from a president , but they are not racist . Trump didn \u2019 t suggest that the four congressional rads leave America because of their race or national origin . He offered the suggestion because of their hatred , as he sees it\u2026 for America . This couldn \u2019 t be clearer . There are other \u2018 minority lawmakers \u2019 who oppose Trump \u2019 s policies . He did not suggest , and has never suggested , that they leave America\u2026\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s statement isn \u2019 t from the anti-immigrant playbook . It \u2019 s from the \u2018 America , love it or leave it \u2019 playbook . This doesn \u2019 t mean his statement was appropriate , coming from the American president , but it does mean it wasn \u2019 t anti-immigrant . Trump is fine with immigrants as long as ( 1 ) they are here legally and ( 2 ) they don \u2019 t hate America . \u201d\n\u201c Donald Trump tweeting that the leftist non-white women in the House of Representatives loosely known as \u2018 The Squad \u2019 should go back to the countries they came from and fix the problems there , then come back and show us how they did it , is a prime example of how different Americans define racism differently\u2026 While once we had , or thought we had , some fairly firm definitions for racist activity or speech , most having to do with intent or belief , we now have an \u2018 I know it when I see it \u2019 standard\u2026 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden have both recently been accused of racism , or engaging in racist tropes , or whatever we \u2019 re calling it now\u2026 Racism has become the new pornography . We know it when we see it . \u201d\n\u201c Words matter . Especially emotionally loaded words such as \u2018 racist. \u2019 That \u2019 s why it is so frustrating to see President Trump \u2019 s awful , inexcusable tweets telling Democratic congresswomen to \u2018 go back \u2019 to other countries mischaracterized as racist . Race and nationality are not the same thing . Race and ethnicity are not even the same thing . Race and religion are far from synonymous . Likewise , racism is not the same thing as xenophobia , or as nativism , or as bigotry . Racism is a form of bigotry , but not all bigotry is racism\u2026\n\u201c When words are over-used or misused , they lose their power . That \u2019 s why we all learn the story of the boy who cried wolf . If \u2018 racism \u2019 is used to refer to everything that is seen as bad and as seen as having anything to do with \u2018 other-ness , \u2019 people start tuning it out . Because it is used to mean so many things , it begins to mean nothing . Its horribleness then becomes more difficult , not less , to recognize and counteract . Trump \u2019 s tweets were wrong because they were nativist and arguably bigoted . To say that is to say enough . \u201d\nSome , however , contend that Trump \u2019 s \u201c commentary calls to mind the same kinds of dark , xenophobic , hatred that has greeted new Americans since there were new Americans , and , while it certainly continues to this day , it isn \u2019 t a sentiment most Americans are used to hearing from their President\u2026 The story of America is written in the blood , sweat , tears and \u2013 certainly \u2013 perspectives , opinions , and hard work of immigrants . We are a nation where anyone can become an American , and on becoming so is held in the same standing as any other . When we disparage immigrants \u2013 or our political enemies , or both \u2013 as less than their fellow Americans , we do a disservice to the very idea of America , and the ideals that make our country great . \u201d\n\u201c On Sunday , Donald Trump gave the Democrats a gift\u2026 On Monday , the four congresswomen handed Trump a gift in return , managing to respond to the president \u2019 s insults in some of the most politically self-destructive ways possible\u2026\n\u201c First , Ilhan Omar of Minnesota again called for impeaching President Trump during the press conference with the members of the \u201c Squad \u201d yesterday afternoon . The latest NBC News poll finds that just 21 percent of registered voters want the House to begin impeachment proceedings\u2026 Second , Omar also contended Trump \u2018 has been credibly accused of committing multiple crimes , including colluding with a foreign government to interfere with our election. \u2019 Did she miss the entire Mueller report ? Or does she think that Trump did collude and that over 22 months , Robert Mueller and his whole team of investigators and prosecutors just missed the evidence ? \u201d\n\u201c Since even before Pelosi took back the speaker \u2019 s gavel in 2018 , she has been begging her Democratic colleagues to drop the impeachment fantasy . She has been clear about this since Trump 's inauguration , saying over and over again that it is not the strategy to pursue , especially as the 2020 elections are just around the corner . Yet Omar and Tlaib called for it anyway on national television , stoking the fire of impeachment and challenging fellow Democrats to get behind an issue that Pelosi has explicitly instructed the caucus to drop\u2026\n\u201c It is astonishing to see they did not band together for at least 48 hours , taking full advantage of the political win Trump handed them . One would think that they would have rallied together , putting their strategic and personal differences aside long enough to refocus their attention and energy on a common enemy . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
