    "content": "A relatively small group of House Democrats , including legendary congressman John Lewis , staged a sit-in on the House floor on Wednesday in order to coerce the Republican leadership to hold what will ultimately be a failed vote on new gun control measures . That 's not to understate the importance of what the Democrats attempted , but if they really wanted to out-flank the Republican blockade , they could 've simply sued the GOP leadership , which is both the favorite tactic of the Republican presidential nominee and precisely what the congressional Republicans have often done when faced with legislative hurdles from the White House .\nIn case you dialed up the proceedings on C-SPAN and noticed anything but the protest , you were n't alone . Shortly after Connecticut congressman John Larson declared , `` Rise up , Americans , rise up , Democrats , we will occupy this floor , '' Paul Ryan shut off the TV cameras -- clearly because the Republicans are n't at all immature . The House Speaker seems to have forgotten about the existence of the internet and social media , which , cumulatively , far outpaces the C-SPAN audience , and the absence of live television only inflamed supporters online who witnessed firsthand the lengths to which the GOP will go to genuflect before gilded effigies of Wayne LaPierre .\nHere 's why the sit-in was so important , beyond any subsequent legislation itself .\nThe protest , as well as Chris Murphy 's filibuster a week earlier , gave us a reasonably clear idea of which members of Congress are brave enough to rise up against the lopsided influence of the gun lobby and the NRA , and , conversely , which members of Congress are obvious cowards who 'd rather defy the will of a supermajority of Americans who support new gun regulations .\nKnowing the Republicans filibustered four gun control items in the Senate , you 'd think the popular divide among American voters was similarly split , reflected in the roughly 50/50 cloture votes ( 53-47 , 44-56 , 47-53 , etc ) . Contrarily , the same party that 's nominated Pennywise the Clown for president even though he 's despised by nearly everyone minus middle-aged white bros , defied the will of the people . Not a small margin of voters , mind you .\n[ S ] upport for specific gun control measures was very strong , with 92 % saying they wanted expanded background checks , 87 % supporting a ban for felons or people with mental health problems and 85 % saying they would ban people on federal watchlists from buying guns . Among Republicans , that number is even higher -- 90 % say they favor preventing people on the terror watch list or `` no fly '' list from buying a gun .\nEven though the majorities are undeniably overwhelming , that last number is the salient one . 90 percent of Republicans -- not liberals , not HillaryBots , not BernieBots -- 90 percent of Republicans support banning gun sales to suspects on the FBI 's terrorist watch list . 90 percent .
