The Republican Party is doubling down on this trickle-down theory that says thou shalt concentrate wealth at the very top of our society.

All of that is true. But it is not true that regulation holds poor people down or regulation keeps middle class from advancing. That's kind of patently bulls- - -.\n\nOn the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal\n\n\n\nYeah, I do oppose it.
