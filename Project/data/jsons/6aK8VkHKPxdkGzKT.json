And when I say `` someone , '' I 'm looking at you , President Obama -- or at least members of your administration .\nI ca n't fathom how Obama , one of the best orators of modern-day politics , could be such a poor advocate for what 's arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration . I can assure you that if there were a law named after me -- such as `` Obeidallahcare '' or `` Deanaid '' -- I would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it .\nSure , most of us get the broad strokes of the Affordable Care Act commonly known as Obamacare : the individual mandate , coverage for the uninsured , children on parents ' policy until 26 , carriers can not deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition . But the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds , if not thousands , of regulations . What else does the law offer , and how will Americans be able to gain access to its benefits ?\nWe hear about state health insurance exchanges going into effect in October , but in the same breath we hear that many governors wo n't implement them .

And I 'm far from alone on this . A poll in April found that 40 % of Americans did n't even know if Obamacare is still in effect , which translates into roughly 130 million Americans not even knowing if the law still exists , let alone understanding the details of it .\nEven more concerning is that a recent poll of doctors found by a wide margin that they are `` not at all familiar '' with how certain key provisions of the law will be implemented . And astoundingly , it appears that Democratic members of Congress do n't even fully grasp how Obamacare will be put into effect . That point was made crystal clear when Democratic Sen. Max Baucus , one of the early champions of the law , recently labeled the rollout of Obamacare `` a huge train wreck coming down . '' In response , Obama 's chief of staff has been spending time over the past three months giving presentations to Democrats in Congress so they can better understand the law .\nWhat 's even more surprising is that Obama has allowed the void of information from his end to be filled almost unchallenged by Republicans , who have been actively working to define the law in the worst possible terms . Unless Obama is mimicking the rope-a-dope fighting strategy made famous by Muhammad Ali , his administration 's outreach to the public on Obamacare has been an abysmal failure .\nJUST WATCHED Business owners still split on Obamacare Replay More Videos ...
