    "content": "( CNN ) As the world 's heath experts race to find treatments -- and eventually , a cure -- for the novel coronavirus , two drugs have jumped to the front of the conversation : chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine .\nPresident Donald Trump has called the drugs , which are used to treat malaria and other conditions , game changers , and a rush to procure the pharmaceuticals spurred several US states to take measures to prevent shortages amid the Covid-19 pandemic\nNew York moved to begin trials Tuesday , procuring 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine and 750,000 doses of chloroquine , Gov . Andrew Cuomo said . In addition , Bayer , the drug maker , has donated 3 million doses of Resochin , its brand name for chloroquine , to the federal government .\nPerhaps demonstrating why health officials are urging caution -- saying chloroquine requires further clinical study and might not be the panacea it 's billed to be -- officials in Nigeria 's Lagos state have reported three overdoses in the days since the drug entered the conversation surrounding the pandemic .\nIn Arizona , a man died after reportedly taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums .\nSo , what exactly are these drugs , and what promise do they hold ?\nChloroquine is used to treat malaria , as well as in chemoprophylaxis , which is the administering of drugs to prevent the development of disease , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Since 2006 , it has not been recommended for use in severe malaria because of problems with resistance , particularly in the Oceania region , according to the World Health Organization .\nWHO includes it on its list of `` essential medicines , '' meaning it should be kept affordable and accessible at all times .\nJUST WATCHED Dr. Fauci : There is no 'magic drug ' for coronavirus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dr. Fauci : There is no 'magic drug ' for coronavirus 01:52\nAccording to the Swiss-registered organization , Medicines for Malaria Venture , chloroquine is a derivative of quinine , which French chemists in 1820 isolated from the bark of the cinchona tree found in South America , employing it as a treatment for fevers .\nGerman scientists created the synthetic chloroquine in 1934 as part of a class of anti-malarials , MMV said , and chloroquine and DDT became `` the two principal weapons in WHO 's global eradication malaria campaign '' following World War II , the organization said .\nHydroxychloroquine is what 's known as an analog of chloroquine , meaning the two have similar structures but different chemical and biological properties . The former is considered the less toxic derivative , according to studies .\nIt 's given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis , lupus and the blood disorder porphyria cutanea tarda , the CDC said .\nThe reason Trump lauds the drugs is because they 've been shown , in labs , to be effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses -- including the SARS strain that causes Covid-19 -- as well as other coronaviruses , the CDC said .\nHydroxychloroquine is being studied to determine if it can prevent the onset of Covid-19 before or after a patient is infected with the SARS coronavirus strain that causes it , and if it can be used to treat Covid-19 sufferers , the CDC said .\nBecause the drug has been in use for years , Trump said , it potentially poses fewer risks than a newly developed drug .\nJUST WATCHED Inside Oxford lab developing 30 minute coronavirus test Replay More Videos ...

''\nThe CDC said the combination can disrupt the heart 's electrical activity and warns against prescribing the paired drugs to anyone with chronic medical conditions , such as renal failure or hepatic disease .\nChloroquine 's side effects include seizures , nausea , vomiting , deafness , vision changes and low blood pressure .

''\nFor these reasons , the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved the drugs for coronavirus treatment , despite Trump claiming Thursday the agency had done so\nIn a Thursday statement , the FDA said it had been working with government agencies and universities to learn whether chloroquine can reduce symptoms and stem the spread of Covid-19 in those with mild to moderate cases of the virus .\n`` We also must ensure these products are effective ; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other , more appropriate treatments , '' FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in the statement .\nDuring a meeting of the coronavirus task force , Hahn called for `` a large , pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered -- asked and answered .
