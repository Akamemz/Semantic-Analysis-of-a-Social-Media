    "content": "It started with a carefully calibrated trade weapon , an algorithm that spat out a list of targets for an assault on China ordered up by a U.S. president determined to rebalance the relationship between the world \u2019 s two biggest economies . The goal : building leverage for negotiations aimed at forcing wholesale changes in China \u2019 s economic architecture while limiting the pain to businesses and consumers at home . \u201c We \u2019 ve given this an enormous amount of thought , \u201d Robert Lighthizer , the U.S. trade representative , told senators in March 2018 , highlighting the work of the computer model his team had constructed . \u201c It \u2019 s a sensible , moderate , appropriate amount , \u201d he went on , \u201c and it is calculated and created in a very businesslike , sensible way . \u201d\nThe algorithm produced a 28-page list of Chinese-made products , including aircraft tires , pacemakers , and printed circuit boards , whose total value\u2014 $ 34 billion\u2014matched an estimate of the annual cost to U.S. businesses of Chinese intellectual-property theft and forced technology transfers . The more than 800 items on the list were selected for their potential to inflict pain on industries Beijing has designated as strategically important while taking into account the potential disruption to U.S. supply chains . Adding to the complexity , the task was to throttle back China \u2019 s imports without American consumers taking notice or endangering President Donald Trump \u2019 s promised economic boom .\nThe model , though , didn \u2019 t account for the unpredictability of Trump . Behind closed doors , the president took the modest number\u2014equal to 7 % of the $ 505 billion in goods the U.S. imported from China in 2017\u2014almost as an affront . He didn \u2019 t want moderate or appropriate . He grumbled to aides the figure was too low and demanded it be rounded up to at least $ 50 billion . Trump also asked his staff , almost as an aside : \u201c Do you think I should put tariffs on everything from China ? \u201d\nTwenty months later , what began as method now looks more and more like madness . A tit-for-tat tariff war has ensnared more than 70 % of bilateral trade in goods and raised the specter of a decoupling of two economies that once seemed destined to become progressively more intertwined . If the countries can \u2019 t resolve at least some of their differences in the coming weeks , the White House will on Dec. 15 add 15 % punitive tariffs on a further $ 160 billion in Chinese imports , delivering on what were once just presidential ruminations . That tariff round could jeopardize America \u2019 s record-long expansion , according to some economists . As it stands , the existing duties will knock 0.8 % off global growth in 2020 , according to recent forecasts from the International Monetary Fund .\nPresident Trump Meets with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the White House on Oct. 11 . Photographer : Shealah Craighead/White House\nThe disruptions of an all-out trade war may yet be averted : Trump and China \u2019 s president , Xi Jinping , appear intent on reaching at least a partial truce by mid-December . In a Nov. 12 speech , Trump again signaled he would refrain from a new tariff assault if Beijing agrees to a \u201c phase one \u201d deal that hinges largely on it stepping up U.S. agricultural purchases to as much as $ 50 billion within two years , more than twice the level before the conflict , and curtailing intellectual-property theft . Trump sees it as the start of a more comprehensive agreement . But Chinese officials quietly say they see any future successful phases as unlikely and that commodity purchases will at first simply be at the level they were before the Trump tariffs . Skeptics in the Trump administration also question whether Beijing is willing to close a larger transformative deal with a president running for reelection amid a slowing economy .\nPoliticians and businesses across the board agree Trump was right to take on China . At the same time , the issues being tackled in a first phase of the trade deal are much narrower than the ambitious goals the White House once set for itself . There \u2019 s little doubt the fight will have a place in history , says Douglas Irwin , an economic historian at Dartmouth : No American president in the past century has waged an economic war on this scale . But while Trump created an opportunity , he risks squandering it as well .\n\u201c Are we going to look back and say , \u2018 This was all a failure \u2019 ? I don \u2019 t think so , \u201d says Wendy Cutler , a former U.S. trade negotiator who leads the Asia Society Policy Institute . \u201c But if we end up comparing what they \u2019 re able to accomplish vs. their initial objectives , I think their accomplishments are going to fall way short . And they won \u2019 t be the first administration to do that . But wow , they certainly raised the stakes and certainly allowed U.S. interests to suffer through the tariffs in this effort . \u201d\nThe picture that emerges from dozens of interviews over the past year with officials and other people close to negotiations is one in which one man \u2019 s impetuousness has confounded attempts at strategy . It \u2019 s the story of a president caught between his instincts as a dealmaker , his place in history , and a contentious band of aides , some of whom goad him into more radical action and others who tease him into restraint .\nTrade War Cabinet \u2014 Robert Lighthizer : The Reagan administration alumnus is Trump \u2019 s trade czar and leads negotiations with China . Photographer : Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\u201c That \u2019 s very Nixonian ! \u201d intoned Larry Kudlow , the head of the National Economic Council , as the president and his aides huddled in the Oval Office in August to debate an intervention to weaken the dollar . The strong greenback is an obsession for Trump , who believes it undermines his tariffs . Three months on , the invocation has different connotations as Trump faces possible impeachment . But back then it was a code between two seventysomething men for avoiding an economic mistake\u2014an allusion to Richard Nixon \u2019 s August 1971 decision to end the dollar \u2019 s convertibility to gold . That move led to years of turmoil in markets and the stagflation of the 1970s .\nWell into September , Trump said he would never settle for a partial deal with China ; it had to be the grand slam . Yet behind the scenes , his advisers were starting to discuss how to negotiate a stage-by-stage agreement and harvest elements that both sides had already largely concurred on , including a pact to avoid competitive currency devaluations hashed out in February when the Chinese team was in Washington .\nTo extract concessions from China , the self-proclaimed \u201c Tariff Man \u201d would have to roll back some duties put in place over the summer\u2014a move some of his advisers , including Peter Navarro , the White House \u2019 s most strident China hawk , oppose . In a Nov. 8 email to reporters , Navarro blamed \u201c propagandists within the Chinese government \u201d for inciting stories that a withdrawal of tariffs might be nigh . He and Kudlow , who says tariff \u201c concessions \u201d are needed to close the deal , have sparred openly .\nLarry Kudlow : The former CNBC host drafted by Trump to lead his National Economic Council is the administration \u2019 s most prominent free trader . Photographer : Evan Vucci/AP Photo\nThe two men \u2019 s battle echoes divides that have existed inside the administration since the beginning . On Oct. 11 , shortly before Trump sat down with China \u2019 s top negotiator , Vice Premier Liu He , in a televised Oval Office meeting to announce a \u201c substantial phase one deal , \u201d Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with the president so he could sign off on the step-by-step approach . This , they argued , was a way to pocket some wins , take the pressure off the U.S. economy , and have another crack at the tricky issues in a second stage . Only one member of the team disagreed .\nNavarro , who was present , appeared intent on sabotaging the plan and , according to one person with knowledge of what transpired , interrupted the two cabinet members so forcefully that Trump eventually turned to him and said : \u201c Peter , calm down ! \u201d Asked about the incident , Navarro said he is \u201c always a passionate defender of the president \u2019 s deep understanding of the situation with China and his practical solutions . But I don \u2019 t comment on private meetings with the president . What happens in the Oval should stay in the Oval . \u201d\nWithin an hour of that exchange , Liu and his team arrived at the White House to finalize the truce . The discussion before the cameras arrived seemed inconclusive to some attending and left them confused , though Trump would minutes later praise a \u201c lovefest \u201d in U.S.-China relations to reporters . In the days that followed , Trump insisted that the teams were making progress and that he and Xi would likely sign the deal at a Nov. 16-17 gathering of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Santiago . That summit was canceled after anti-government protests broke out in Chile , and a new venue and date haven \u2019 t been decided . In the meantime , the two countries are still negotiating exactly what each side will concede in a phase one deal .\nDeal or No Deal Notable moments in the past year of the U.S.-China trade war , annotated with Trump \u2019 s tweets .\nThe events of the past few weeks fit a pattern of false dawns in the trade war . At least three other times a pact seemed within reach , only to collapse in a back-and-forth of recriminations . One of the key moments came in May , when miscalculations by both sides blew up an expansive deal that had taken months to put together . Within days , Trump threatened new tariffs and placed Chinese telecommunications gear maker Huawei Technologies Co. on a U.S. Department of Commerce blacklist , restricting its ability to buy hardware , software , and services from American high-tech suppliers .\nPeter Navarro : Trump \u2019 s special adviser on trade is an avowed China hawk . Photographer : Alex Brandon/AP Photo\nThe Huawei decision cast a shadow on a late June encounter between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka , where the Chinese president asked his U.S. counterpart to ease pressure on the company and\u2014according to Trump\u2014promised to immediately buy \u201c a tremendous amount \u201d of American agricultural products . Trump agreed and returned from Osaka optimistic that a deal was in sight . But by the time U.S. negotiators returned from a round of follow-up talks in Shanghai in late July , the mood was souring . \u201c That is the problem with China , they just don \u2019 t come through , \u201d read one in a barrage of Trump tweets on July 30 , in which he complained that Beijing hadn \u2019 t lived up to its promise to restart agricultural purchases .\nThat set up one of the most volatile months of the trade war , feeding recession fears in the U.S. as signs of a slowdown in manufacturing continued to build , particularly in key presidential election battleground states . In early August , Trump announced a major escalation\u2014tariffs covering the remaining $ 300 billion in China imports that would start to take effect Sept. 1 . At his behest , the Treasury Department officially labeled China a currency manipulator . Then , on Aug. 23 , the president directed U.S. businesses to explore ways of getting out of China . \u201c Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China , including bringing your companies HOME , \u201d he tweeted .\nSteven Mnuchin : The ex-Goldman Sachs chief information officer heads Treasury and co-leads the China talks . Photographer : Erin Scott/Reuters\nMarkets tumbled , and panicked chief executive officers and donors demanded to have a word with the president . Among them were Blackstone \u2019 s Stephen Schwarzman and Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson , according to people close to the negotiations who asked not to be identified because the calls were private . They say the interventions succeeded . From that moment on , Trump was in deescalation and dealmaking mode .\nFears of an economic slowdown in the U.S. that coalesced in August also changed the equation . Publicly , Trump \u2019 s advisers point to historic lows in unemployment and modest inflation to bat back concerns . They blame the Federal Reserve and a strong dollar for growth well below the 3 % to 4 % Trump once promised . ( The U.S. grew at an annual rate of 1.9 % in the third quarter . ) But the angst that the trade war may be exacting a greater-than-anticipated economic toll is thinly veiled .\nWorries about the economy burnished the attractiveness of a phase one deal that puts on hold new tariffs that would directly hit U.S. consumers . A partial pact would also reward American farmers for standing with Trump , despite being cut off from one of their most important markets . According to people familiar with the negotiations , missing from the partial deal are measures to address a key U.S. concern : how China often forces foreign companies to hand over technology . There \u2019 s also nothing related to the vast web of subsidies China uses to help its companies compete internationally\u2014an issue Beijing is unlikely to budge on .\nDespite the diminished expectations , Trump and his allies are quick to defend his handling of the trade war . American supply chains have started shifting away from China , they say , pointing to Apple Inc. and other companies \u2019 shifting of production to such places as India and Vietnam . And they are elated that Trump will also leave in place tariffs on a large portion of Chinese imports as an enforcement tool to ensure Beijing lives up to its side of the bargain .\nKudlow argues that a phase one deal will reduce the uncertainty hanging over the U.S. economy while starting to address important elements of the rivalry with China . \u201c It \u2019 s a big win for the president . Because his tough negotiating style and his use of tariffs\u2014both of which have come under great criticism\u2014are paying off . \u201d\nEven Navarro touts the strategy in public . \u201c The great deal President Trump seeks for America , China , and the world is the deal Ambassador Lighthizer negotiated in May 2019 but China reneged on , \u201d he says . That agreement would have addressed what he calls China \u2019 s seven \u201c deadly structural sins , \u201d including its industrial subsidies and its dumping of low-cost products in the U.S . He also argues Trump , \u201c as a master negotiator , \u201d will ensure further phases happen . \u201c Of course I support the president in pursuing this strategy because it helps the American economy and American farmers , ranchers , and workers . \u201d\nU.S. Goods and Services Trade Deficit Data : U.S. Census Bureau\nCritics , on the other hand , point to a U.S. trade deficit that \u2019 s on track to end 2019 some $ 150 billion larger than at the end of 2016 , on the eve of Trump taking office . And they argue that the tariffs and export restrictions his administration has put in place have , if anything , reinforced Beijing \u2019 s determination to outpace the U.S. in critical areas such as artificial intelligence and biomedicine .\nTrump \u2019 s phase one deal , if it happens , \u201c will not alter China \u2019 s ambitions , \u201d says Charlene Barshefsky , who negotiated China \u2019 s entry into the World Trade Organization under President Bill Clinton . Rather than using protectionism and industrial policy to give American businesses a leg up , the U.S. should be investing in education , research , and infrastructure to boost its own competitive position . \u201c We \u2019 ll never out-China China , \u201d she says . \u201c And if you spent 10 minutes in the country , you \u2019 d know that . \u201d\nDemocrats looking to challenge Trump in 2020 will likely portray a phase one deal as caving . Yet , for better or worse , he has embedded the view of a malign China in Washington . Candidates from former Vice President Joe Biden to Senator Elizabeth Warren agree the U.S. has to take on Beijing , though they find fault in Trump \u2019 s tactics . Notably , none of the front-runners have committed to removing tariffs on China .\nA U.S. business community that wants both a short-term end to the uncertainty and longer-term fundamental changes in China \u2019 s economic governance is also wondering if it was all worth it . \u201c What we all need now is a trade truce , \u201d says Myron Brilliant , who heads the international division at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . Whether the fight will prove worth it \u201c will depend on what comes next . \u201d\nMany China experts argue Trump \u2019 s approach was too improvised and forced allies into a \u201c you \u2019 re either with us or against us \u201d equation that is divorced from the economic and business realities they face . \u201c We \u2019 re in a political era of simple solutions at a time when these really require complicated and coordinated actions , \u201d says Jude Blanchette , an expert on Chinese leadership politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .\nIrwin , the Dartmouth professor , says an historical reference point is the War of 1812\u2014which the U.S. waged against an England that was by far its largest trading partner and a predatory one to boot . One slogan touted at the beginning of that conflict , he says , was \u201c on to Canada ! \u201d \u2014a promise to annex new territories . When the war ended with a return to preexisting boundaries , the parameters for victory changed : \u201c You know what our slogan was after the war ? \u2018 Not one inch of territory ceded ! \u2019 \u201d Trump and his aides \u201c launched the trade war against China and said , \u2018 We are going to remake the economy and get the state out of industrial policy and mercantilism , \u2019 \u201d Irwin says . \u201c We are ending it by saying , \u2018 They are buying just as much stuff as they did before . \u2019 \u201d",

American supply chains have started shifting away from China, they say, pointing to Apple Inc. and other companies\u2019 shifting of production to such places as India and Vietnam. And they are elated that Trump will also leave in place tariffs on a large portion of Chinese imports as an enforcement tool to ensure Beijing lives up to its side of the bargain.\n\nKudlow argues that a phase one deal will reduce the uncertainty hanging over the U.S. economy while starting to address important elements of the rivalry with China. \u201cIt\u2019s a big win for the president. Because his tough negotiating style and his use of tariffs\u2014both of which have come under great criticism\u2014are paying off.\u201d\n\nEven Navarro touts the strategy in public. \u201cThe great deal President Trump seeks for America, China, and the world is the deal Ambassador Lighthizer negotiated in May 2019 but China reneged on,\u201d he says. That agreement would have addressed what he calls China\u2019s seven \u201cdeadly structural sins,\u201d including its industrial subsidies and its dumping of low-cost products in the U.S. He also argues Trump, \u201cas a master negotiator,\u201d will ensure further phases happen. \u201cOf course I support the president in pursuing this strategy because it helps the American economy and American farmers, ranchers, and workers.\u201d\n\nU.S. Goods and Services Trade Deficit Data: U.S. Census Bureau\n\nCritics, on the other hand, point to a U.S. trade deficit that\u2019s on track to end 2019 some $150 billion larger than at the end of 2016, on the eve of Trump taking office. And they argue that the tariffs and export restrictions his administration has put in place have, if anything, reinforced Beijing\u2019s determination to outpace the U.S. in critical areas such as artificial intelligence and biomedicine.\n\nTrump\u2019s phase one deal, if it happens, \u201cwill not alter China\u2019s ambitions,\u201d says Charlene Barshefsky, who negotiated China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization under President Bill Clinton. Rather than using protectionism and industrial policy to give American businesses a leg up, the U.S. should be investing in education, research, and infrastructure to boost its own competitive position. \u201cWe\u2019ll never out-China China,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if you spent 10 minutes in the country, you\u2019d know that.\u201d\n\nDemocrats looking to challenge Trump in 2020 will likely portray a phase one deal as caving. Yet, for better or worse, he has embedded the view of a malign China in Washington. Candidates from former Vice President Joe Biden to Senator Elizabeth Warren agree the U.S. has to take on Beijing, though they find fault in Trump\u2019s tactics. Notably, none of the front-runners have committed to removing tariffs on China.\n\nA U.S. business community that wants both a short-term end to the uncertainty and longer-term fundamental changes in China\u2019s economic governance is also wondering if it was all worth it. \u201cWhat we all need now is a trade truce,\u201d says Myron Brilliant, who heads the international division at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Whether the fight will prove worth it \u201cwill depend on what comes next.\u201d\n\nMany China experts argue Trump\u2019s approach was too improvised and forced allies into a \u201cyou\u2019re either with us or against us\u201d equation that is divorced from the economic and business realities they face. \u201cWe\u2019re in a political era of simple solutions at a time when these really require complicated and coordinated actions,\u201d says Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese leadership politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\n\nIrwin, the Dartmouth professor, says an historical reference point is the War of 1812\u2014which the U.S. waged against an England that was by far its largest trading partner and a predatory one to boot. One slogan touted at the beginning of that conflict, he says, was \u201con to Canada!\u201d\u2014a promise to annex new territories. When the war ended with a return to preexisting boundaries, the parameters for victory changed: \u201cYou know what our slogan was after the war? \u2018Not one inch of territory ceded!\u2019 \u201d Trump and his aides \u201claunched the trade war against China and said, \u2018We are going to remake the economy and get the state out of industrial policy and mercantilism,\u2019 \u201d Irwin says. \u201cWe are ending it by saying, \u2018They are buying just as much stuff as they did before.\u2019 \u201d",
