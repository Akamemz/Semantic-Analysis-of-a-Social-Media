There are certain expectations for party affiliates. These expectations essentially act as restrictions on the ideas party members can have. Certainly there are Republicans and Democrats who fail to meet the expectations of their party on some issues. However, the point remains that for the vast majority of party members, political expectations are a main driving force in forming their positions on an issue.

Isn\u2019t it only natural that such political expectations will present themselves? I believe so. However, I also believe certain issues should transcend the restrictions imposed by political expectations. The most significant of such issues is abortion.\n\nAbortion is one of the most politically polarizing issues in the United States. Generally speaking, Republicans are more pro-life and Democrats are more pro-choice. There is relatively little variance from that pattern. The political polarization of abortion is a significant problem. It is a problem not only because it fuels political gridlock and hopeless bickering, but also because it pressures people into complying with party positions in substitution for contemplative idea formation.\n\nAbortion should not be a politically polarizing issue. I am not asserting that abortion isn\u2019t a polarizing issue, but simply that the polarization of the issue should not be party-based. I don\u2019t know of any inherent characteristic of either party that causes it to take either a pro-life or pro-choice position. Abortion should not be decided along party lines because the true issue is not political.
