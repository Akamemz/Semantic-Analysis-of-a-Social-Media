Monday's tabletop discussion did not allow for the same type of overt finger-pointing.\n\nStill, both men were frequently on the attack. The president especially, perhaps still seeking to make up for his lackadaisical performance in his first debate with Romney, was consistently critical of his opponent.\n\nObama had some barbs ready.

On a pair of occasions, Romney said, \"Attacking me is not an agenda,\" arguing any political points the president scored would do nothing to address challenges in the Middle East or increase trade.\n\nRomney Didn't Define Many Policy Differences\n\nRomney, the former governor of Massachusetts, got off several tough lines against the president's record.

He warned about ways in which U.S. stature could be diminished if defense spending is cut, or if the domestic economy is not healed.\n\nDid Someone Say This Was A Foreign Policy Debate?\n\nThe U.S. economy seemed as much on the candidates' minds as any foreign challenge.
