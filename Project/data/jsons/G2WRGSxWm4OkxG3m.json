The Committee appears to have dismissed Cause of Action \u2019 s complaint without engaging in a preliminary inquiry and without explanation , where independent evidence unearthed by the media supports the allegations of misconduct . The American public , who elected their Senators , deserve an ethics committee that takes its role seriously , and our hope is that the public receives an explanation for this delay in oversight , \u201d the groups CEO Dan Epstein said in a statement .\n[ Watch Fox : Louisiana Republican Senate Candidate Bill Cassidy discusses the latest in his Senate race in the 4 p.m .

Howard Kurtz wrote the story for the Post when Bradlee stepped down in 1991 and also conducted Bradlee\u2019s final interview in 2012. \u201cHe now seems a throwback in a more corporate era, a constantly cursing Navy vet who walked the newsroom floor, slapping backs, lifting spirits with a few words of praise,\u201d wrote Howie. New Yorker Editor David Remnick argues that Bradlee was such an over-the-top figure that even Jason Robards\u2019 portrayal was \u201cunderplayed.\u201d Remnick passes along the story from former Post reporter Tom Zito of the day that he was served with a subpoena while working at the Post: \u201cI explained that my father was of Italian descent, lived in New Jersey, had constructed many publicly financed apartment buildings\u2014and was now being investigated by the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York regarding income-tax evasion. \u2018Your father?\u2019 Ben exclaimed in disbelief, and then called out to his secretary, \u2018Get John Mitchell on the phone.\u2019 In less than a minute, the voice of the Attorney General could be heard on the speaker box, asking, somewhat curtly, \u2018What do you want, Ben?\u2019 In his wonderfully gruff but patrician demeanor, and flashing a broad smile to me, Ben replied, \u2018What I want is for you to never again send a subpoena over here asking any of my reporters to give grand-jury testimony about their parents. And if you do, I\u2019m going to personally come over there and shove it up your ass.\u2019 The subpoena was quashed the next day.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The group, backed by industrialist brother Charles and David Koch unveiled this morning similar spots in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire that feature residents blasting Democrats for placing partisan priorities over constituents needs. From the attack on Iowa Democrat Bruce Braley: \u201cThere are lots of reasons Bruce Braley isn\u2019t right for Iowa,\u201d says Sandy Metzel of Sioux City, \u201cthe most important reason is that a vote for Bruce Braley is a vote for President Obama and his failed policies.\u201d\n\n\n\nErnst hogs attention with closing spot - Iowa Republican Senate nominee Joni Ernst heads back to the pig pen for her closing spot.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Harkin told the NYT: \u201cI think Chuck Grassley is pretty proud of the fact that he didn\u2019t go to law school and he\u2019s going to be chairman of the Judiciary Committee \u2014 first time ever.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., is the latest Democrat to offer less than tepid support for President Obama. During a debate Tuesday against Republican Scott Brown, Shaheen drew audible laughs when she said, \u201cIn some ways I approve, and some things I don\u2019t approve,\u201d when asked if she approved of the job the president is doing. \u201cSo, you know, like most questions that we deal with as policymakers,\u201d she continued, \u201cthere aren\u2019t simple answers, \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nROBERTS: \u2018NOT ON MY WATCH\u2019\n\nThe Roberts campaign released a new ad touting Sen.

From the ad: \u201cFederal investigators found a company Perdue ran discriminated against women. Paid them less than men for the same work while Perdue made $42 million. When over 2,000 women fought back to provide for their families, Perdue\u2019s company was forced to pay nearly $19 million. David Perdue takes care of millionaires like David Perdue.

The Democratic candidates in the 15 most competitive Senate races have raised $11 million from trial lawyers for the 2014 election. The industry\u2019s main lobby is the American Association for Justice\u2026 In each of the eight most competitive Senate races, the industry providing the most money is trial lawyers. \u2026 In no race, however, do the lawyers play a greater role than in the open-seat Senate race in Iowa. Bruce Braley is a trial lawyer and a former member of AAJ\u2019s board of governors\u2026. Braley\u2019s lawyer haul of $1.25 million is more than what he brought in from the next 34 industries combined. AAJ knows that Braley would be their man in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\n\n\nWATCHDOG GROUP STILL WAITING ON REID ETHICS COMPLAINT\n\nWatchdog group Cause of Action is calling on a Senate Ethics panel to respond to a complaint it filed against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2013. At the center of the complaint is Reid\u2019s alleged use of his political clout to lobby U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to reconsider and approve EB-5 immigrant investor visa petitions where a company receiving the foreign funding was a major contributor to the Democratic Party, and, at the time, was represented by the Senator\u2019s son. \u201cFor over 300 days to pass since our complaint was received with no reasoned notice of the Committee\u2019s determination is unacceptable. The Committee appears to have dismissed Cause of Action\u2019s complaint without engaging in a preliminary inquiry and without explanation, where independent evidence unearthed by the media supports the allegations of misconduct. The American public, who elected their Senators, deserve an ethics committee that takes its role seriously, and our hope is that the public receives an explanation for this delay in oversight,\u201d the groups CEO Dan Epstein said in a statement.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Louisiana Republican Senate Candidate Bill Cassidy discusses the latest in his Senate race in the 4 p.m. ET hour]\n\n\n\nPICK SIX: UDALL THROWN FOR A HICKENLOOP?\n\nRepublicans need to win an additional six seats to take control of the Senate this November. Which six Democrat-held seats are the most vulnerable? Based off of your e-mails and tweets, here are the top picks of Fox News First readers: Arkansas (13.8%), Montana (13.2%), West Virginia (12.4%), South Dakota (12%), Louisiana (11.7%), and Alaska (8.8%). Reader Dave Lutter of Golden, Colo., argues that it is just not President Obama\u2019s unpopularity that could propel the Centennial State to the top tier. Lutter writes, \u201cLook no further that embattled Gov. John Hickenlooper [D-Colo.] [He] signed off on some of the most restrictive gun laws in the US following the Aurora Theatre and Sandy Hook shootings, enraging responsible gun owners here in the Centennial State. Adding to that, is [his] steadfast refusal to green-light the execution of mass murderer Nathan Dunlap. Coloradans support the Death Penalty at 64%, meaning this crosses well over partisan lines.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare your top six picks.

Republican-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, essentially tied in the polls, used their final moments before the television cameras to come up with some of the most personal attacks leveled so far in what has already been an extremely negative campaign\u2026 [O]ne of the sharpest exchanges may have been while they discussed the death penalty. Both men said they supported it, but Crist questioned how serious Scott takes the duty because he delayed an execution when the date conflicted with a political fundraiser for Attorney General Pam Bondi. Bondi later apologized for the incident and Scott said at the time he was unaware of the reason for the delay. But Crist hammered away at Scott, asking him outright if he knew the delay was due to a fundraiser. Scott finally replied, \u2018She apologized, Charlie.

After years as a trucker, he bought a semi three weeks ago and made a company of his own. Thomas was traveling from Texas to Pompano Beach and was on his last stop before a delivery in Orlando when his entire truck and alcohol cargo was stolen. \u2018I don\u2019t mean to cry about it but I\u2019m just trying to do the best I can and make a better life,\u2019 Thomas told WFTV.

That\u2019s beautiful,\u2019 he said. The call came in from detectives that the truck had been found in Miami.
