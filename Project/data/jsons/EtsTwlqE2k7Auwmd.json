    "content": "An influential Democratic senator is now backing the push to restore insurance plans canceled due to ObamaCare , on the heels of a blunt critique from Bill Clinton on President Obama 's handling of the health care law 's rocky rollout .\nSen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said Tuesday she is co-sponsoring a bill by Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La. , that would force insurance companies to reinstate canceled policies that Obama repeatedly vowed that people could keep .\nAdding to the pressure on the administration , the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee also is hearing testimony Wednesday morning on the troubled HealthCare.gov website . Amid a report in The Washington Post that claims the site may not be fully functional by the end of the month , despite the president 's promises , lawmakers will hear from top technology officials , including U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park .\nWhile the IT professionals try to fix the broken site , lawmakers are looking at ways to address the wave of cancellation notices .\n`` The Affordable Care Act is a good law , but it is not perfect , '' Feinstein said in a statement . `` I believe the Landrieu bill is a commonsense fix that will protect individuals in the private insurance market from being forced to change their insurance plan . ''\nThe involvement of Feinstein in the push to restore canceled policies adds considerable pressure on the Obama administration to address those concerns . The president is rapidly facing questions and concerns from members of his own party about the law 's rollout .\nFeinstein said she has received 30,842 calls , emails and letters from constituents about the cancellations and premium increases . A man from Rancho Mirage , her office said , told Feinstein that he is being forced to spend more than $ 400 extra per month for a similar policy .\n\u201c I believe consumers should be allowed to choose their plans , and they should be adequately informed about those choices , '' Feinstein said . `` Consumers must be told what their coverage does and does not include so families don \u2019 t find themselves paying for an insurance policy they believe is comprehensive when , in fact , it is not . ''\nSeparately , House Republicans have scheduled a Friday vote on a proposal by Rep.
