    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Days after Washington Gov . Jay Inslee tweeted criticism of the Trump administration \u2019 s handling of the coronavirus outbreak , his chief of staff got a call from an aide to Mike Pence asking if Inslee could meet with the vice president .\nWhen Inslee \u2019 s office agreed Pence would fly to his state the next day , the aide had to run because Pence was talking to reporters and wanted to announce the trip in the next 30 seconds .\nThe eagerness of Pence , a former Indiana governor , to reach out to states ' chief executives \u2013 including those who have gotten crosswise with the administration \u2013 was likewise apparent in a comment he made to Inslee .\n\u201c We \u2019 re governors , and we understand this , \u201d David Postman , Inslee \u2019 s chief of staff , remembers Pence saying .\nThe vice president 's natural kinship with governors has helped him pull off the rare feat of pleasing both his boss and those his boss has attacked .\n\u201c He gets along with people , I think , much better than I do , \u201d President Donald Trump said last week . \u201c Mike can put up with things that \u2013 sometimes I say , ` It \u2019 s amazing that he can put up with it . \u2019 \u201d\nPence hasn \u2019 t always been able to deliver everything requested by governors , who have been frustrated by aspects of the federal government \u2019 s response to the biggest crisis most of them will ever face .\nBut Pence generally gets high marks for serving as a liaison .\nIt \u2019 s a role he \u2019 s embraced through regular conversations with governors in which he offers help navigating the bureaucracy and fields requests for more resources . Pence eases the tensions when they flare up .\n\u201c He \u2019 s been really helpful and engaged , \u201d said Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , one of the Democrats besides Inslee whom the president has criticized and said Pence shouldn \u2019 t deal with .\nAnalysis : For governors , the coronavirus is a test , from its deadly toll to dealing with Trump\nThere are still plenty of frustrations with the federal government \u2019 s response .\nGovernors have complained of testing and equipment shortages . They \u2019 ve pushed for stronger implementation of a wartime powers act to increase production of ventilators , testing supplies and personal protective equipment . And they \u2019 ve repeatedly urged a more cohesive national strategy , including a centralized process of distributing the lifesaving supplies so states do n't bid against each other and the federal government .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a kind of lack of coordination , \u201d Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan , a Republican who heads the National Governors Association and who has not been shy about speaking out , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We \u2019 re improving the process , but that certainly is an issue . \u201d\nColorado Gov . Jared Polis , a Democrat , appealed directly to Pence for help , describing in a letter the state \u2019 s \u201c crisis-level shortage \u201d of equipment to protect health care workers and first responders .\nAsked about the governor \u2019 s interactions with Pence , spokesman Conor Cahill said Polis appreciates the vice president \u2019 s \u201c responsiveness and accessibility \u201d but \u201c remains concerned about the clarity and transparency around the timing and qualities of the lifesaving supplies . \u201d\n\u201c A few weeks ago , the guidance seemed to be that states should get these materials themselves , which Colorado is actively pursuing , \u201d Cahill said in an email last week . \u201c And now the guidance seems to be shifting , but no one is certain . \u201d\nIn fact , the next day Trump tweeted that he was sending 100 ventilators to the state , not because of Polis \u2013 who had complained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had blocked a shipment of ventilators \u2013 but at the request of Cory Gardner , the state \u2019 s Republican senator who faces a difficult reelection .\n\u201c President Donald Trump is treating lifesaving medical equipment as emoluments he can dole out as favors to loyalists , \u201d the Denver Post wrote in an editorial .\nIllinois Gov . J . B.

''\n\u201c He \u2019 s the one that organized and convinced everybody to have the governors so involved in the debate and the discussion , \u201d Hogan said . \u201c He has risen to the occasion . \u2026 I think he 's done a really incredible job . \u201d\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos Poll found the public is more likely to have extremely positive or negative views of Trump \u2019 s performance and more moderate opinions of Pence 's .\nThere is a notable difference among Democrats . Nearly one in four say they have a \u201c great deal \u201d or \u201c fair amount of trust \u201d in Pence to provide accurate information about coronavirus compared with 14 % who say that about Trump .\nSeventy-three percent of Democrats surveyed April 9-10 say they have \u201c not very much \u201d or no trust in Pence , and 84 % say that about Trump .\nWhen Trump put Pence in charge of the administration \u2019 s Coronavirus Task Force in late February , the vice president noted that he was Indiana \u2019 s governor in 2014 when the first Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) case in the USA emerged \u2013 in Indiana . Pence said he learned from that the importance of partnerships between the different levels of governments and health authorities in responding to dangerous infectious diseases .\nPence did not mention another health crisis he \u2019 d dealt with as governor in 2015 , the nation \u2019 s first HIV outbreak linked to the injection of oral painkillers . Studies in medical journals have said the outbreak could have been prevented if the state had acted faster in allowing clean-needle exchanges .\nNew York Gov . Andrew Cuomo publicly thanked Pence for clearing hurdles with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention so New York laboratories could do their own coronavirus testing . That dramatically increased testing capacity .\n\u201c I had asked Vice President Pence to go back to the federal powers and say , let 's get FDA and CDC out of the mandatory approval business , break that federal bottleneck and let the states use their own laboratories , \u201d Cuomo said in mid-March .\nLikewise , Pence helped Washington state clear regulatory hurdles , so its health department could validate local labs .\n\u201c We were able to get our health lab director in direct contact with the person at the FDA , who had heard from the vice president that this was a priority , \u201d said Postman , the Inslee aide .\nWhen Pence \u2019 s home state was very short on test kits last month , Indiana Gov . Eric Holcomb reached out to his predecessor for help . After Pence connected Holcomb with the CDC director , the state got a boost to tide it over until kits could be produced locally .\n\u201c A few moments ago , I got off the phone with the vice president , \u201d Holcomb said during one of his briefings in March . \u201c He was just checking in \u2026 I was able to share with him what our concerns were . \u201d\nOhio Gov . Mike DeWine , another Republican , said governors are used to dealing with the vice president , whose outreach started well before the coranavirus .\n`` Since I became governor , he 's reached out on numerous occasions to me , just to see if I needed anything or if he could be of help , '' DeWine told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nDuring the health crisis , DeWine said , Pence has helped cut through red tape several times , including when Ohio was arranging how to continue feeding low-income students who were no longer able to get free meals at shuttered schools .\nPence has held an unprecedented number of calls with governors , according to Hogan . Group calls can last more than two hours .\n\u201c We \u2019 re interacting with governors every day , seven days a week , \u201d Pence said at a briefing . \u201c And we welcome that . \u201d\nDuring a call with all governors , Maine \u2019 s Janet Mills urged the administration not to forget about rural states .
