''\nOn Saturday , the veep took to Twitter to `` clarify '' what he meant , saying there 's no legal basis for Republicans to subpoena him .\n`` The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump 's shaking down the Ukraine government \u2013 they should go to the White House , '' Biden said .\nI want to clarify something I said yesterday .
