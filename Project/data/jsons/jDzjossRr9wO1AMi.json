Here \u2019 s what they told us . One medical expert says Joe Biden , Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump are part of the population known as 'superagers . '\nJoe Biden was lying on the operating table and about to get surgery for his second brain aneurysm when the doctor told him he might not recover .\n\u201c What 's the most likely thing that will happen if I live ? \u201d Biden asked him . \u201c Well , \u201d the doctor replied , \u201c the side of the brain that the first aneurysm is on controls your ability to speak . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s when the gaffe-prone Biden thought to himself : \u201c Why in the hell didn \u2019 t they tell me this before the '88 campaign ? \u2019 It could \u2019 ve saved us all a lot of trouble , you know what I mean ? \u201d\nThat joke , which Biden told in a speech in 2013 , has taken on new relevance now that he \u2019 s on the campaign trail for president again and facing questions about his gaffes . Though Biden has a longstanding reputation for verbal flubs , they \u2019 re now inextricably linked to the 76-year-old \u2019 s age .\nBut concerns about Biden \u2019 s age and mental fitness are likely overblown , according to experts on aging and the brain , as well as actuarial tables used by the insurance industry to estimate the health and longevity of customers .\nThe two brain aneurysms Biden suffered in 1988 were fully treated and he showed no signs of mental trouble as a result , said Dr. Neal Kassell , who performed the surgery on Biden three decades ago . Nor did Biden suffer any brain damage that could come back to haunt him in old age , Kassell said .\n\u201c He is every bit as sharp as he was 31 years ago . I haven \u2019 t seen any change , \u201d Kassell said . \u201c I can tell you with absolute certainty that he had no brain damage , either from the hemorrhage or from the operations that he had . There was no damage whatsoever . \u201d\nBiden isn \u2019 t the only presidential candidate facing questions about age \u2014 five of them are 70 or older , including 73-year-old Donald Trump \u2014 but there 's reason not to fret about the others , either .\nThe oldest candidate , Bernie Sanders , will turn 78 next month \u2014 eclipsing the average life expectancy for a man in the United States by two years . The youngest of the septuagenarian candidates is Elizabeth Warren , 70 . Trump \u2019 s little-known Republican challenger , former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld , is 74 .\nWith the prospect that the next president might be the oldest ever to take office , a team of researchers with the American Federation for Aging Research released a study last month to answer this morbid question : How likely is he or she to die in office ?\nThe candidates \u201c have prospects for survival that extend well beyond the four-year term of the office . The bottom line is their chronological age does not matter at all , \u201d Dr. S. Jay Olshansky , who led the study , said .\nOf course the researchers ca n't predict death : Their life-expectancy projections for the candidates are based on estimates of the entire population contained in actuarial tables used by the insurance industry and the Social Security Administration . There \u2019 s no better way to estimate the longevity or health of the candidates without individual medical examinations and a look at their medical records , they said .\nBut \u201c there was nothing we could see that would lead us to believe that the age of an individual , in and of itself , should be a disqualifying factor to run for president , \u201d Olshansky said .\nFor someone of Sanders ' age and gender , the study pegs the chances of surviving a four-year term at 76.8 percent . The corresponding figures for the other candidates are Biden at 79.2 percent , Weld at 83.6 percent , Trump at 84.8 percent and Warren at 91.8 percent .\nBut Olshansky points out that presidential candidates are probably healthier than the average U.S. citizen \u2014 and will likely live longer than the average as a result . People who have good health care , are more highly educated and have pensions generally live longer .\n\u201c They all belong to a subgroup of the population that is privileged . And privileged subgroups tend to live longer and better than the average , \u201d Olshansky said . \u201c Despite Bernie Sanders perhaps claiming otherwise , he \u2019 s part of the 1 percent . Actually , it \u2019 s more like 1/100 of 1 percent . \u201d\nOlshansky said the older candidates could belong to a group of what are called \u201c superagers , \u201d people who live into their 80s but show a mental sharpness as if they were in their 50s or 60s .\nEmily Rogalski , a Northwestern University neuroscientist and associate psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor who specializes in studying superagers , said it \u2019 s exceedingly difficult to \u201c determine someone \u2019 s cognitive abilities simply by knowing someone \u2019 s chronological age . \u201d\nAs for Biden \u2019 s prior brain surgeries , Rogalski said she can \u2019 t comment because she hasn \u2019 t evaluated him .\n\u201c It \u2019 s difficult to comment specifically on any one individual \u2019 s cognitive status without knowing more deeply about their medical history , \u201d she said .\nOlshansky echoed her point and said it was also \u201c inappropriate \u201d for psychologists and psychiatrists to opine on Trump 's mental acuity without having analyzed him . And , he said , it \u2019 s a stretch to make candidates ' gaffes into something more than understandable human error .\n\u201c When you hear somebody on TV and they make a mistake during a speech or a debate , you \u2019 ve got to cut them some slack , \u201d Olshansky said . \u201c If you \u2019 ve ever given a speech , it \u2019 s not easy standing in front of a crowd of people \u2014 especially standing in front of television cameras with millions of people watching \u2014 and avoiding verbal mistakes . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s physician , Dr. Kevin O'Connor , said in a statement provided by the campaign that \u201c Vice President Biden is in excellent physical condition . He is more than capable of handling the rigors of the campaign and the office for which he is running . \u201d\nKassell , who performed brain surgery on Biden , went a step further : \u201c I am going to vote for the candidate who I am absolutely certain has a brain that is functioning . And that narrows it down exactly to one . \u201d\nThough some theorize that the presidency ages office-holders more than the average adult , a 2011 study by Olshansky showed that wasn \u2019 t the case . Of 34 presidents who died of natural causes , 23 lived longer than expected , based on actuarial data .\nThough the high number of older candidates is new in the 2020 election cycle , the politics of age and morbidity on the campaign trail isn \u2019 t .\nIn 2008 , for instance , when Biden was running on Barack Obama \u2019 s ticket , the campaign indirectly attacked Republican nominee John McCain \u2019 s age by noting his running mate , Sarah Palin , was \u201c a heartbeat away from the presidency. \u201d At the time , McCain had a 1 in 3 chance of not living to age 80 . He died just short of his 82nd birthday and would have completed both terms of his presidency had he won in 2008 and been reelected in 2012 .\nHal Tepfer , a professor of actuarial sciences at Boston University , cautioned against relying too much on actuarial estimates for the presidential candidates , whose lifestyles and education probably make them more likely to live longer than the average American .\nRegardless , Tepfer said , they \u2019 re still septuagenarians . And there \u2019 s still a risk , whether it \u2019 s for voters choosing a president or an insurance industry accepting a customer .\n\u201c They \u2019 re still likelier to die than the average person , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s why they probably can \u2019 t buy insurance . If I \u2019 m 75 , they \u2019 re not going to sell me long-term care insurance because they know I \u2019 m going to use it . The same is true for life insurance .
