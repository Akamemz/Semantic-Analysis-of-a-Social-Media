    "content": "Americans collectively are losing billions of dollars a year out of their retirement accounts because they 're paying excessive fees , according to researchers studying thousands of employer-sponsored retirement plans across the country .\nThe rearchers say part of the trouble is that many employers that offer 401 ( k ) plans to their workers are outgunned by financial firms that sell them bad plans loaded with hefty fees . That 's especially true , they say , for small and midsize employers that do n't have much financial expertise in-house .\nAt a manufacturing firm in Minnesota , Justin Johnson , a new employee , is enrolling in the 401 ( k ) plan . He has two kids , and his fiancee is going back to school . Money is tight , but he wants to save for the future .\nHe 's on the phone with a financial adviser that the small company , named MITGI , uses to walk people through the process . The adviser did n't want to do a recorded interview , but he let us join in on the speakerphone call when we visited the company to report our story . `` So what are the fees like in this plan ? '' Johnson asks the adviser . It 's an important question because high fees can badly damage your ability to make money over time .\nThe fees in this retirement plan make it `` extremely competitive , '' says the financial adviser , who is with EFS Advisors in Cambridge , Minn. That sounds good . But it does n't appear to be true . Federal disclosure documents show the fees are more than three times higher than other plans available to employees at companies like this one , according to Ian Ayres , a law professor at Yale Law School .\n`` He misrepresented the truth , '' says Ayres , who studies 401 ( k ) plans . We asked Ayres if making such a claim is even legal . `` No , '' he says , `` to misrepresent the truth in that way is almost certainly not legal . ''\nAyres says MITGI got saddled with a bad set of investment options that 's taking way too much out of the workers ' savings . And he has seen this before . Ayres has analyzed 401 ( k ) plans at thousands of companies across the country . `` Sadly , the high-costness is both outrageous and all too prevalent , '' he says . `` There are billions of dollars in excess fees being charged each year to American workers . '' And , Ayres says , smaller companies are more likely to have overpriced 401 ( k ) plans .\nThe problem is that many people running small and midsized companies are not very good at setting up 401 ( k ) plans for their workers . And that 's somewhat understandable . They do n't know much about saving and investing . They 're in business because they 're really good at other things .\n`` We make tools that are smaller than a human hair in diameter , '' says Eric Lipke , the president of MITGI , which stands for Midwest Industrial Tool Grinding Inc .\nThe Hutchinson , Minn. , company manufactures tiny drill bit-type tools used to make pacemakers and other medical devices . Lipke oversees the company 's 55 employees . And he says the firm wants to offer good benefits so it can attract and keep good workers .\n`` To come and work here for 20 years , 30 years , whatever their working career is , and when they 're done be able to say , 'You know , I had really good health care , I have a great retirement plan , ' `` Lipke says .\nBut five years ago , when he went to set up the 401 ( k ) plan , nobody at this company knew anything about how to do it . Lipke needed help . He asked business people running other local companies if they knew a good financial adviser . Somebody recommended this one with EFS Advisors , who said he could set up a good plan for the workers . `` We chose him and he did set up the plan , and all but one employee participated right away from the beginning , '' Lipke says . `` So it was something people liked . ''\nBut Lipke realized he still has no idea whether he ended up with a good 401 ( k ) plan for the workers . `` We do n't have a really good benchmark to know how good it is or not , '' he says . `` We do n't know where to find help for that . ''\nSo , as part of this NPR series `` Your Money and Your Life , '' we found Lipke some help . We put him and his new human resources director , Sheila Murphy , in touch with another professor who studies all this , Kent Smetters , an economist at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School .\nSmetters studies 401 ( k ) plans and does a personal finance radio show . We asked him to take a look at MITGI 's plan , including fee disclosures and other details . Murphy and Lipke then called him and asked him basically whether their plan was good , bad or ugly .\n`` I would put it between bad and ugly , '' Smetters told them .\n`` I think I 've seen worse but not by much , '' Smetters said . `` This really is a high-fee plan . ''\nThe disclosure documents for the plan show that the workers at the company are paying about 2 percent in fees . That might not sound like much . But Smetters says it 's really high .\nTwo percent of your entire life savings every year , compounded over long periods of time \u2014 30 or 40 years \u2014 eats up half the earnings on the money you invest . So Smetters says this plan is sucking way too much money out of the employees ' pockets . But , he says , `` the good news here is there 's a great opportunity here for shifting to a 401 ( k ) plan '' that will deliver a higher return over time .\nAs for EFS Advisors , the firm declined repeated requests for an interview or a comment . But Sarah Holden , a research director with the trade group the Investment Company Institute , says studies finding that many 401 ( k ) plans are overpriced have focused primarily on fees . But , she says , `` what none of the studies have done is look to see what was the range of services that were being included . ''\nSo , for example , one plan might cost more than another , but employees might get more access to financial advisers in the more expensive plan . Of course , many plans could still be way overpriced . But Holden says basically businesses need to shop around .\n`` It 's their job '' , she says , to make sure that the fees they 're paying for the services they 're getting `` are reasonable . ''\nWhen he spoke with the managers at MITGI , the Wharton School 's Smetters suggested a few reputable financial firms for them to contact that might have plans with competitive prices .\nSmetters says MITGI made the same mistake that many other businesses and individuals do . Many people find a financial adviser just by asking friends for a recommendation . This is what we humans do , right ? Anybody know a good plumber ?

Somebody who has `` financial adviser '' written on a business card , often `` he 's not only a financial adviser , '' Smetters says . `` He 's also a sales guy who is recommending that your 401 ( k ) plan use funds that have high expense ratios because that 's how he ultimately gets paid . ''\nThat 's why Smetters says he recommends that people and businesses only use what are known as `` fee-only '' advisers . By law , a `` fee-only '' adviser must place your interests first and not accept hidden commissions from mutual funds , insurance companies or anyone else .
