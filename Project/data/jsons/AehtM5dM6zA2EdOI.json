    "content": "The Obama administration reversed course Monday and agreed to fully implement a controversial school voucher program that provides federal tuition assistance to a limited number of D.C. youths despite historically mixed opinion of the program among city leaders and the White House \u2019 s own efforts to eliminate it .\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , and Sen. Joe Lieberman , Connecticut independent - two high-profile supporters of vouchers- announced Monday that they had struck an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education to carry out the program with no specific cap on enrollment , so both new and existing enrollees can apply to the program .\nMr. Obama had not included any funding for the politically sensitive scholarship program in his fiscal 2013 budget proposal , part of a trend by his administration since 2009 to phase out the program by funding only existing enrollees .\nThe agreement builds on a \u201c dramatic explosion \u201d of school-choice initiatives across the country , totaling 25 bills in 13 states over the past two legislative cycles , said Robert Enlow , president and CEO of the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice .\n\u201c The reality is the [ D.C ] program is helping children do better , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s really good they have reversed course on this and don \u2019 t want to get in a big fight with Congress . \u201d\nRep. Darrell E. Issa , California Republican , and Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , who are charged with oversight of D.C. affairs , said in a joint statement Monday that they are \u201c pleased that the Obama administration has apparently given up on its opposition to fully implementing this bipartisan initiative . \u201d\nD.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray has said the city will act \u201c with fidelity \u201d to implement the scholarship program despite his long-standing objections to it .\nMr. Boehner said the agreement is \u201c consistent with the law already on the books , \u201d namely the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results ( SOAR ) Act of 2011 , which Mr. Obama signed during last year \u2019 s springtime budget standoff . The legislation , which Mr. Boehner and Mr. Lieberman pushed to passage , renewed the scholarship program for five years and mandated that an annual federal payment of $ 60 million be split in equal thirds among the program , D.C. Public Schools and public charter schools in the District .\nMr. Boehner \u2019 s spokesman said congressional leaders expect the program to be fully funded at $ 20 million in light of the Obama administration \u2019 s commitment , \u201c and we will work to make sure that happens . \u201d\nThe administration \u2019 s depiction of Monday \u2019 s development was more limited in scope than that of Capitol Hill lawmakers , who claimed Mr. Obama had \u201c reversed course \u201d through the agreement . The U.S. Department of Education said that rather than an open-ended program , it wants to increase enrollment from 1,615 to about 1,700 students for the coming year to allow for a \u201c statistically valid evaluation of the program , as directed by Congress . \u201d\n\u201c The president and I are committed to ensuring that the education of the children currently in [ the program ] is not disrupted , \u201d Education Secretary Arne Duncan said through a spokesman . \u201c Beyond that commitment , however , we remain convinced that our time and resources are best spent on reforming the public school system to benefit all students , and we look forward to working with Congress in a bipartisan manner to advance that goal . \u201d\nThe National Education Association shares that position because vouchers \u201c divert essential resources from public schools to private and religious schools , \u201d according to its website .\nCongress established the D.C . Opportunity Scholarship Program in 2004 , a first-of-its-kind program for the city \u2019 s parents who want to send their disadvantaged children to Catholic schools or other private options instead of struggling public schools .\nThe new agreement would allow for new enrollees with new scholarships , said Ed Davies , vice president of external affairs for the D.C. Children & Youth Investment Corp. , which administers the program .\nThe program has been a political flash point since then and even surfaced in this year \u2019 s presidential race . Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican nominee , denounced Mr. Obama \u2019 s stance on the campaign trail last month , declaring it \u201c inexcusable \u201d for the president to try to shut down the program .\nMr. Gray , a Democrat , said true school choice lies with a robust system of traditional public schools and charter schools . When federal lawmakers struck a deal on D.C. vouchers in 2011 , Mr. Gray accused Congress of using city residents as \u201c bargaining chips in political negotiations and guinea pigs for the favorite social experiments of important congressional leaders . \u201d\n\u201c The Congress has said that the city will have a voucher program , and we \u2019 ll move forward to continue to implement it , \u201d Mr. Gray told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday . \u201c But I really believe that the future lies in having a strong public education system . \u201d\nFor nearly a decade , the program has straddled the delicate fault line between federal oversight of the nation \u2019 s capital and the District \u2019 s self-governance , although mixed views among city politicians make the vouchers a more complex issue than typical disputes over D.C. home rule . Former D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous , a Democrat and early champion for the program , has continued to voice support for the scholarship program and even tested the city \u2019 s unflagging loyalty to Mr. Obama with a series of ads that criticized the Democratic president \u2019 s stance on the scholarships .\n\u201c The program \u2019 s been an incredible success , \u201d Mr. Chavous said in a phone interview . \u201c The only thing that \u2019 s gotten in the way is politics . \u201d\nMr. Gray said school choice is alive and well in the District , with enrollment in public charter schools surpassing 40 percent of the city \u2019 s public student body - 41 percent in public charters and 59 percent in D.C. Public Schools - for the first time during the past year .\n\u201c I would love to see them invest [ available federal funding ] in our charters and our traditional D.C. Public Schools , \u201d Mr. Gray said of Congress .\nMeanwhile , local officials are knee-deep in applications for the federally backed voucher program . The trust that administers the scholarships recently passed its first major deadline for the 2012-13 school year , and Mr. Davies said the new agreement could allow the trust to offer more awards this year among the applications it has received .\nMore than 1,600 students enrolled in 53 participating schools through the voucher program in the 2011-12 school year . Among them , 87 percent were black and 11 percent were Hispanic . Students from east of the Anacostia River accounted for more than 43 percent of participating students , and the average household income for enrollees citywide was $ 23,401 in 2010 .\nHigh school students can receive up to $ 12,000 in assistance per year ; middle school and elementary school students are eligible for up to $ 8,000 . The students attend a variety of institutions , including prep schools , for-profit private schools and an array of Catholic schools , according to the trust .\nDuring the past school year , 816 recipients of the scholarships attended 18 Catholic schools in the District , Archdiocese of Washington spokeswoman Brie Hall said . The archdiocese praised Monday \u2019 s announcement as \u201c significant for the children of the District of Columbia \u201d because it allows low-income families to \u201c choose the school that best fits their child \u2019 s needs . \u201d\n\u201c Access to quality education should not be denied because of one \u2019 s income or residence , \u201d Ms. Hall said .\nThe archdiocese , which said its lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill were limited to letters of support from its superintendent of schools Deacon Bert L \u2019 Homme , praised Mr. Boehner \u2019 s work to resuscitate the program last year as \u201c a promising step forward for education in the District of Columbia . \u201d\nBut the mayor rallied with education and civil rights leaders in April 2011 to denounce the program as another form of federal interference into local affairs .\nHis views stood in contrast to those of then-council Chairman Kwame R. Brown , who spoke in support of the program and positioned himself as an education reformer during his tenure on the council .
