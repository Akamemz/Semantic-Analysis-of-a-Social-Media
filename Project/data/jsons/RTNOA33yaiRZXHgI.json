    "content": "House Republicans are threatening to subpoena a top Planned Parenthood official unless the group voluntarily makes her available for an interview about alleged sales of fetal tissue from abortions . But the women \u2019 s health group is ramping up its own efforts to contain political damage from the controversy .\nThe dispute over Dr. Deborah Nucatola and her comments in a video secretly taped by anti-abortion activists means abortion - not a dominant issue in American politics for several years - could move front and center this fall as Republican lawmakers try to score political points on Planned Parenthood . Several Republican presidential candidates have already attacked the\norganization , meaning abortion rights could be part of the struggle for the White House as well .\nRep. Joe Pitts ( R-Pa. ) , chairman of the health subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 the panel intends to subpoena Nucatola if Planned Parenthood refuses to change its position on letting committee staffers interview her by no later than the end of next week when the House gets set to go on August recess .\nPlanned Parenthood has said it is \u201c still assessing \u201d whether Nucatola will voluntarily attend a staff briefing , citing concerns over GOP allegations of potential criminal activity by the organization and its employees .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll subpoena her , \u201d Pitts warned . \u201c If they say no , we \u2019 ll subpoena her . \u201d\nPitts said the timing would likely be after Congress returns from its five-week recess .\nIn a Monday letter to Rep. Fred Upton ( R-Mich. ) , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , Planned Parenthood \u2019 s senior counsel declined to make Nucatola available for a staff-level briefing . The group instead offered to have another Planned Parenthood official lead the briefing over how it handles fetal tissue from abortions .\nBut Pitts said the Center for Medical Progress - the anti-abortion organization behind the secret taping of Nucatola and other Planned Parenthood employees - \u201c has thousands of hours of these tapes , \u201d meaning more video releases are expected in coming weeks and months . So far , only two such videos have emerged , but Planned Parenthood officials have acknowledged publicly and privately that they expect more to be released soon .\nRepublicans leaders are preparing for votes this fall to defund Planned Parenthood , which receives more than $ 500 million in federal funds annually . Sens . Rand Paul ( Ky. ) and Ted Cruz ( Texas ) , both running for the GOP presidential nomination , have said they will push amendments to cut off funding . Sen. Mike Lee ( R-Utah ) and 10 other senators - including Cruz , Paul and Marco Rubio ( R-Fla. ) , another presidential hopeful - sent a letter on Tuesday to the Justice Department and Health and Human Services Administration calling for a full investigation into the conduct of Planned Parenthood .\nAnd Rep. Diane Black ( R-Tenn. ) introduced legislation this week to place a one-year moratorium on all federal funding for Planned Parenthood while Congress investigates the group \u2019 s activities . More than 80 Republicans currently co-sponsor the legislation .\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee has begun an official inquiry into the matter .\nPlanned Parenthood , meanwhile , has launched its own counter-offensive to try limit the damage on Capitol Hill . The organization is reaching out to numerous lawmakers in the House and Senate , aggressively working its grassroots network and trying to rally political support . Planned Parenthood officials insist the group follows federal law on fetal tissue uses .\n\u201c Know that while Cruz and Paul are fighting over who gets to introduce the next bill taking basic , necessary preventive care away from millions of women , men and young people across the country , Planned Parenthood will be continuing to ensure that we provide millions of Americans with critical access to care , \u201d said Dawn Laguens , executive vice president of Planned Parenthood . \u201c We \u2019 ve been a trusted provider for for nearly 100 years \u2014 and we plan to be for the next 100 years as well . \u201d\nRep. Gene Green ( Texas ) , ranking Democrat on the health subcommittee on Energy and Commerce , said Planned Parenthood had reached out to his office , and added that he remains supportive of the group .\n\u201c I have a Planned Parenthood facility in my district that I support because so much of their work about wellness for women , \u201d Green said . \u201c I am supportive of a women \u2019 s right to choose . \u201d\nA Democratic source said the Center for Medical Progress targeted the Planned Parenthood clinic in Green \u2019 s district as well .\nGreen noted that there have been efforts by anti-abortion groups at the federal and state level in Texas targeting Planned Parenthood . \u201c Ultimately they \u2019 re making it difficult for [ Planned Parenthood ] not just to do abortions but also all the good they do for women \u2019 s health issues , \u201d Green added .\nRep. Diane DeGette ( D-Colo. ) , co-chair of the House Pro-Choice Caucus , said this line of attack has been used by anti-abortion activists in the past . She noted that the oversight subcommittee on Energy and Commerce panel held a hearing on the uses of fetal tissue more than a decade ago .\n\u201c Obviously , there are people who have been after Planned Parenthood for a variety of reasons , \u201d DeGette said , noting that her office has been in touch with representatives from the group .\nPlanned Parenthood hasn \u2019 t been alone in its fight . The group has been assisted by a range of progressive organizations that see the scandal as a proxy fight over abortion .\n\u201c Planned Parenthood is so important to so many people , that when the care they rely on is threatened , people come out of the woodwork to fight for us , often without being asked , \u201d Laguens said of the extensive effort .\nMedia Matters , a left-leaning media watchdog group , has conducted extensive research into anti-abortion activist David Daleiden , who runs the California-based Center for Medical Progress . At the same time , American Democracy Legal Fund sent a letter to the California attorney general \u2019 s office asking that the Center for Medical Progress be investigated for allegedly misrepresenting its purpose as a charitable group .
