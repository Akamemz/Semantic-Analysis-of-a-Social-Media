    "content": "The pols and pundits most insistent upon holding a gun-control \u201c conversation \u201d in the wake of mass shootings at schools did the most to turn them into nihilistic wastelands . From the puffed-chest phonies on CNN and MSNBC , we hear a lot about sinister \u201c lobbies \u201d that intimidate passive , cowardly pols . The insufferable Chris Cuomo , whose partisan arrogance is impossible to overstate , rips into this or that Republican for not \u201c standing up \u201d to the NRA . When has Cuomo ever stood up to the morally bankrupt teachers \u2019 unions that turned America \u2019 s public schools into assembly lines of pathology ?\nCuomo , full of cheap outrage , seized upon Trump \u2019 s blameless tweets about the shooting . He pronounced them \u201c stupid. \u201d It is not clear what Trump could possibly have said to satisfy Cuomo . Was he expecting Trump to call for the confiscation of all guns ? The imposition of martial law ?\nThe liberal elite \u2019 s hoped-for \u201c conversation \u201d about guns would never proceed like one . They are not looking for a dialogue but an occasion to diatribe without ever having to answer for their own role in the demise of civil society .\nThe rise of school shootings is due not to the absence of laws but to the absence of a civilized culture that taught students to follow them . Few lobbies have contributed more to that crisis than the liberal elite \u2019 s cherished one , the teachers \u2019 unions . They overflow with self-interested hacks whose pensions fattened as schools disintegrated . Before these educrats laid waste to them , public schools didn \u2019 t need \u201d gun-free zones \u201d and little armies to protect them . Teachers took the shaping of minds and souls seriously . But all that discipline and rigor vanished under the ridicule of a ruling class that now treats the debased condition of schools so solemnly . How , they gasp , did a student from an \u201c alternative school \u201d ( it is still not clear what that means ) invade the school \u2019 s \u201c gun-free zone \u201d and wipe out 17 people ?\nLet the Kimmels and Colberts say what they want about those musty old schools , with their \u201c silly \u201d morning prayers , codes of discipline , and starchy moral lessons . At least those schools weren \u2019 t scene of mass shootings . The teachers in those days didn \u2019 t preach gun control but self-control . Now their successors preach the reverse and wake up to dead colleagues and pupils .\nThat liberal vision of gun control without self-control just means a multiplicity of laws an increasingly depraved citizenry won \u2019 t obey . The Florida shooter , after all , violated numerous laws . Adding a few more wouldn \u2019 t have stopped him .\nWhere does the multiplication of laws end ? It can only end in the destruction of a free society in which the final solution to crime is to treat everyone , both the virtuous and the vicious , as a criminal .
