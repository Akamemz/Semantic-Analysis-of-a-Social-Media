A study at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University found that overall crime was still declining throughout the United States a bit in 2015 . Felony crime declined 1.5 percent nationwide , and dropped by roughly 2 percent in New York . But the highly visible violence of the past year \u2013 such as mass shootings in San Bernardino , Calif. ; Roseburg , Ore ; and Charleston , S.C. \u2013 as well as a slight uptick in the number of murders , has contributed to the feeling of great contradictions when it comes to crime .\nIndeed , 7 in 10 Americans said they believed there was more crime in the US this year than last , according to a Gallup poll in October , up from 2014 . That \u2019 s despite the fact that the nation \u2019 s crime rates have plummeted over the past two decades . But as the polling center noted about its annual survey , \u201c Americans ' perceptions of crime \u2026 are not always on par with reality . \u201d\n\u201c The public 's perception of media coverage certainly gives a skewed image of what 's going on with crime , \u201d said Matthew Freidman , an economist with the Brennan Center in New York and coauthor of the study , to NPR last week . \u201c What we find is that though we 've seen a nearly three-decades-long decline in crime rates , public perception does not match that . \u201d\nThe rise of social media and the 24-hour digital news cycle , as well as the high-profile nature of some of the deaths , may play into that .\nFor example , last December , two NYPD officers were gunned down in their patrol cars \u2013 randomly targeted by a man who said he wanted revenge for the shootings of black men . A sheriff \u2019 s deputy in Texas was shot at a gas station in August , and many police officers say they have felt under siege over the past year . However , there were 39 officers shot and killed so far in 2015 \u2013 a drop from 2014 , when 47 were shot and killed , according to the Officer Down Memorial Page .\nAt the same , concerns about the number of people shot by police or who died in custody continues to create a climate of tension throughout the country . From the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore to the shooting of a black teen and the accidental killing of a black mother and activist in Chicago over the weekend , it has been a year in which violence has drawn much of the nation \u2019 s attention .\nIt is true that many cities saw a rise in the number of murders this year . In New York , there were 339 as of Christmas Day \u2013 slightly more than last year \u2019 s all-time low of 333 , but still well below the 536 murders recorded in 2010 .\nHowever , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston are each projected to see double-digit increases in their murder rates this year .
