It will require intense US focus , endurance and attention to detail to achieve an accounting of Pyongyang 's nuclear arsenal and its verifiable and irreversible termination .\nDespite their isolation and the image of North Korea as a backward state , North Korean negotiators are always well-briefed , and a new generation of younger diplomats is savvier about the outside world than their older counterparts .\n`` We should n't be fooled by our notion that North Korea is a hermit kingdom , '' said Wendy Sherman , a former senior State Department official who negotiated with North Korea on an ultimately unsuccessful missile deal at the end of the Clinton administration .\n`` We saw Kim Jong Un very ably manage the summit with ( South Korean President ) Moon Jae-In .
