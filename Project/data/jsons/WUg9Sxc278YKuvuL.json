The vigil is intended not to politicize the Newtown anniversary , but rather to inspire acts of kindness and service to others , according to organizer David Ackert of Newtown .\nThe number of gun control groups nationwide has doubled in the past year \u2013 some led by small coalitions of Sandy Hook survivors , others led by mothers not directly touched by the tragedy . Many experts cite Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America as a growing legislative force on behalf of gun control , where suddenly state legislators across the US are being confronted by women demanding change \u2013 a kind of Mothers Against Drunk Driving redux .\nIn the year since 20 children and six school staff members were gunned down in Newtown , eight states have enacted 42 pieces of gun control legislation ( with California leading the way ) , ranging from tweaks to concealed-carry laws to outright bans of certain guns and kinds of ammunition .
