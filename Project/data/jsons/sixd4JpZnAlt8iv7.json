    "content": "( CNN ) The Democratic candidates for president gathered in New Hampshire Thursday for their fifth debate , and CNN 's Reality Check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test .\nThe team of reporters , researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the debate , selecting key statements and rating them either true ; mostly true ; true , but misleading ; false ; or it 's complicated .\nAs in past debates , Hillary Clinton took on Bernie Sanders ' voting record on gun control legislation . Thursday night , it came up regarding a debate over who is the true `` progressive candidate . ''\nClinton said , `` If we 're going to get into labels , I do n't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times . I do n't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity , '' referring to Sanders ' voting record .\nAs the CNN Reality Check team has reported before , Sanders did vote against various iterations of the 1993 Brady Bill five times . The bill 's full name is the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and it mandates federal background checks on gun purchasers .\nThere were several votes in that bill 's evolution , the first vote coming in 1991 . Sanders voted against a draft that required a seven-day waiting period for background checks . A subsequent version of the bill returned to the House and Sanders voted against it . Then , in 1993 , two more drafts returned to the House , and Sanders voted against those . Finally , later in 1993 , the Brady Bill finally passed , but without Sanders ' vote .\nSanders has defended his votes , saying that it constituted federal overreach .\n`` There are parts of it that made sense to me , '' he said in an interview on ABC 's `` This Week with George Stephanopoulos '' last month . Sanders added , `` Look George , if you have a small gun shop owner in Northern Vermont who sells a gun legally to somebody and then , you know , something happens to that guy , he goes nuts or something , and he kills somebody , should the gun shop owner be held liable ? I think not . ''\nSanders also added , `` I am absolutely willing , as I 've said for many , many weeks , if not months , to take another look at that piece of legislation . ''\nThough Sanders may have his reasons for voting against the Brady Bill , Clinton 's claim that he voted against it five times is true .\nThe topic of big money influencing American politics was raised by Sanders , who said it was `` undermining American democracy . ''\nClinton attempted to distance herself from perceptions her campaign is influenced by Wall Street interests , saying , `` I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people , at least , know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary . ''\nIt was a refrain she used in Wednesday night 's town hall , too : `` Everybody that I know who looks at what 's happening in this campaign sees the same thing : The Wall Street interests , the money interests , the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me . ''\nWall Street interests may be spending a lot in support of her opponents , but of all the candidates , Clinton is the leading recipient of donations from individuals in the securities and investments industry .\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org , as of January 31 , Clinton has received $ 2.9 million in itemized contributions from a category the Federal Election Commission calls `` Securities and Investments , '' often shorthanded as `` Wall Street . '' That 's the most of any of the candidates . Republican Jeb Bush is just behind Clinton , receiving $ 2.4 million , with Marco Rubio ( $ 1.3 million ) and Ted Cruz ( $ 664,000 ) following .\nClinton implies that Wall Street has no fondness for her . But given that her campaign received $ 2.9 million from securities and investment donors , the most of all the candidates , Republican or Democrat , our verdict is false .\nReality Check : Clinton on Sanders ' $ 1 trillion health care plan\nClinton accused Sanders of not telling voters the truth about his proposals , particularly his Medicare-for-all plan .\n`` I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost . A respected health economist said these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year . I 'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes and not mean it , '' Clinton said .\nActually , according to that health economist , Gerald Friedman of the University of Massachusetts Amherst , Sanders ' universal health care plan would cost nearly $ 1.4 trillion a year .\nBut Sanders has recently been upfront about how much it will cost . He released Friedman 's assessment alongside his plan for Medicare-for-all last month .\nAlso , Sanders has acknowledged that the plan calls for a new 2.2 % income tax on all Americans and a 6.2 % levy on employers , as well as additional taxes on the wealthy . The Vermont senator , however , argues that ultimately middle class Americans will save money under his health plan because they will no longer pay premiums to private insurers .\nThat said , Sanders initially was reluctant to spell out his proposal . Clinton pushed him earlier this year to release the details , pointing out that she pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class . Sanders finally unveiled the plan a few hours before a Democratic debate last month .\nClinton claimed she `` never sent or received any classified material '' when she was secretary of state , and the State Department is `` retroactively classifying '' information in her emails .\nIt is true that all the classifications we 've seen in emails released by the State Department have been retroactive , meaning the State Department determined there was a need to classify the information as they were preparing the emails for release and so they `` upgraded '' it to classified .\nThe State Department also maintains that none of Clinton 's official emails ( of the 85 % reviewed and released so far ) contained information that was marked as classified when it was sent .\nHowever , last week , the State Department acknowledged it had launched a separate review to determine whether any information in the email was classified at the time it was sent and received . That review , led by the bureaus of Diplomatic Security and Intelligence and Research , is ongoing and has yet to put out a verdict on the issue .\nAll of the classified redactions the public has seen so far have been the result of retroactive classifications , but the investigation into whether the information was classified during her time in office is ongoing . For that reason , our verdict is it 's complicated .\nDuring a back-and-forth about health care , Sanders pointed to his role in Congress during the creation of the Affordable Care Act .\n`` I am on the Health , Education , Labor Committee . That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act . The idea that I would dismantle health care in America while we 're waiting to pass a Medicare-for-all is just not accurate , '' Sanders said , adding later : `` I helped write that bill , but by moving forward , rallying the American people , I do believe we should have health care for all . ''\nSanders did indeed sit on the Senate panel that helped craft the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , and used his post to advocate loudly for a single-payer system in which insurance is provided by the government to all citizens .\nSanders was n't alone ; many liberal Democrats pushed for such a provision when crafting comprehensive health care reform . But the single-payer option proved to be divisive , and opposed by most Republicans .\nThat led to the development of alternative mechanisms to get more Americans insured : the establishment of marketplaces for Americans to purchase health insurance , and an individual mandate requiring all Americans obtain coverage .\nWhen Sanders ' preferred version of the bill failed to come up for a vote , he diverted his focus instead to securing the inclusion of billions of dollars in funding to community health centers .\nBut he remained skeptical of a bill that did n't include a single-payer plan . Indeed , in the months leading up to a final vote on the bill , Sanders voiced doubt that he could support the version that lacked such a system ( ultimately , he did vote for the Affordable Care Act ) .\nWhile Sanders played a major role in the debate over health care reform , and helped craft an $ 11 billion inclusion into the final measure , his claim to have `` helped write '' the measure misrepresents his part in creating the central pillars of Obamacare .\nReality Check : Sanders as the longest serving independent in the history of Congress\nSanders , a Vermont independent , stressed his longevity and independence on Thursday when he said , `` I am the longest serving independent in the history of the United States Congress . ''\nSanders was first elected to the House of Representatives as an independent from Vermont in 1990 and assumed office in January 1991 . He won his Vermont Senate seat in 2006 . As a result , although he caucuses with the Democratic Party , Sanders has been an independent in Congress for 25 years .\nThis 25-year tenure is indeed the longest of an independent member of Congress .\nAccording to the Senate 's official record , the two runner-ups are Sen. Harry F. Byrd of Virginia and Sen. David Davis of Illinois .\nByrd was first elected to the House in 1932 as a Democrat . He entered the Senate in 1965 and switched parties to become an independent in 1970 after a clash with the Democratic Party leadership in the run-up to the 1972 presidential election . He left office in 1983 , giving him 13 years as an independent .\nUnlike Byrd , Davis , who had been an associate justice of the Supreme Court and was appointed by Abraham Lincoln , initially assumed office as an independent in 1877 and left office in 1883 , giving him six years in Congress as an independent .\nSanders ' 25 years in Congress is easily the longest span as an independent .\nSanders threw an elbow at some of the country 's largest financial institutions .\n`` Six financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $ 10 trillion , equivalent to 58 % of the ( gross domestic product ) of the United States of America . That is a lot of money , '' Sanders said .\nThe six largest financial institutions are JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America , Citigroup , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , as of September 2015 , according to the Federal Reserve Bank .\nSo , doing the math : $ 9,845,804,000,000 ( assets ) / $ 18,128,200,000,000 ( GDP ) =.5431\nAccordingly , the assets of the six largest institutions equal roughly 54 % of the GDP .\nAsked by MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow why his campaign put up an ad insinuating that he was endorsed by the Nashua Telegraph , Sanders said that his campaign was careful never to say he was `` endorsed '' by a newspaper .\n`` As I understand it , we did not suggest we had the endorsement of the newspaper . Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates and to the best of my knowledge that is what we did . So we never said , never said that somebody , a newspaper , endorsed us that did not . What we did say is , 'Blah blah blah blah ' was said by the newspaper , '' Sanders said .\nThe ad , an online spot entitled `` Endorsements '' showed a blurb from the Telegraph praising his integrity , but the ad did not say the paper endorsed him .\nHowever , in the next clip , the ad said that The Valley News of Lebanon , New Hampshire , `` endorsed '' Sanders . That paper did not endorse Sanders .\nThe Clinton campaign and fact-checkers hit him throughout the day Wednesday and Thursday for the spot and the Sanders campaign eventually revised the ad to remove the `` endorsed '' language .\nDiscussing the need for reforms improving access to care at the Department of Veterans Affairs , Sanders said that a group funded by the Koch brothers is promoting the privatization of the agency . An organization called Concerned Veterans for America is sanctioned by the influential conservative siblings , Sanders said .\nWayne Gable , CVA 's chief executive and trustee , is also a board member of a Koch-backed organization called Freedom Partners , according to a 2013 tax filing . That filing lists CVA as the business name of an affiliated organization called Vets for Economic Freedom Trust . The filing states the tax exempt group had $ 3 million in contributions and a nearly equal amount of expenditures , money allegedly spent advocating for `` policies that will preserve the freedom and liberty that veterans and their families so proudly fought and sacrificed to defend . ''\nThe group produced an anti-Obamacare web video in 2013 , `` Government Health Care Equals Disaster , '' suggesting that the scandal at the VA was a prelude to a looming disaster prompted by the passage of the Affordable Care Act .\nUnfortunately , the CVA has a glossy , yet glitchy website and there is not much documentation of the group 's financials and its staff post-2013 . According to the Guidestar charity finder , the organization has not yet filed its IRS 990 form for 2014 . Furthermore , its affiliated group , Vets for Economic Freedom Trust is not a verified exempt organization , according to the IRS exempt check search tool .\nIn terms of privatizing the VA , the group has a report called the Veterans Independence Act on its website , recommending a voucher system for veterans to purchase insurance through private companies . We 'd like to learn more about the plan but the `` Read the Report '' link at the bottom of the page is dead .\nSanders is correct in describing the group 's Koch lineage and its intent . Our verdict is true .",
