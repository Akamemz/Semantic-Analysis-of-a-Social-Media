    "content": "Donald Trump promised to make better deals as president , and wasted no time brokering what he said Tuesday would be a $ 50 billion investment in the U.S. by a Japanese telecom company , but his hard-bargaining style also is rattling some American businesses .\nBoeing \u2019 s stock price took a nosedive after Mr. Trump posted a Twitter message Tuesday morning declaring that the Pentagon should cancel its $ 4 billion contract for a new Air Force One , just days after the president-elect stirred fears of trade wars by threatening \u2014 also on Twitter \u2014 to slap a 35 percent punitive tax on companies that move factories abroad .\nWhether making threats against American companies or announcing the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in the U.S. , Mr. Trump \u2019 s moves were entirely unpredictable \u2014 a quality that tends to unnerve financial markets .\nMr. Trump emerged from an elevator in the lobby of Trump Tower accompanied by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son , surprising reporters there with an announcement that the Japanese telecom executive had committed to a $ 50 billion investment in U.S. startup companies that would create an estimated 50,000 jobs .\nIt was the second time before taking office that Mr. Trump scored on the jobs front . Last week he announced that he helped convince Carrier to reverse plans to close its Indiana factory and move to Mexico , saving 1,100 jobs .\n\u201c He is one of the great men of industry , \u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr . Son , with whom he met during a day otherwise occupied with interviews for Cabinet posts . \u201c One of the truly great men . \u201d\n\u201c I just came to celebrate his new job , \u201d Mr . Son said . \u201c I said , \u2018 This is great , the U.S. will become great again. \u2019 \u201c\nEarlier in the day , it was Boeing that got taken by surprise . Mr. Trump tweeted : \u201c Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents , but costs are out of control , more than $ 4 billion . Cancel order ! \u201d\nThe price tag cited by Mr. Trump includes the lifetime cost of the whole program , including research and development and the actual building cost for the two aircraft needed for the Air Force One fleet . The Pentagon ordered the two specialized airplanes last year , and they are scheduled to be ready in 2023 .\nShares of Boeing stock dropped by more than 1 percent in premarket trading after the tweet , but the price climbed back by the end of the day .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s sparring with U.S. companies comes as he stacks his Cabinet with business titans , including naming hedge fund billionaire Steve Mnuchin as treasury secretary , billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary and retail billionaire Betsy DeVos as education secretary .\nHe interviewed Exxon CEO Rex W. Tillerson for secretary of state Tuesday .\nThe jab at Boeing , which Mr. Trump later accused of \u201c doing a little bit of a number \u201d on taxpayers , ruffled feathers at America \u2019 s biggest exporter and irked financial analysts .\n\u201c The chilling effect on industry is huge , if you are a contractor , \u201d Franklin Turner , a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English , told Reuters news agency . \u201c To think that in 140 characters the president can cancel a program is ridiculous . There would be a detailed review by legal professionals on the merits of the termination . \u201d\nMr. Trump experienced similar backlash from Republicans on Capitol Hill when he tweeted about punishing U.S. companies with a 35 percent tariff on their products . They warned he would start a trade war and that U.S. businesses from automobile companies to farms would suffer .\nDoug Oberhelman , chairman of the Business Roundtable , conceded that Mr. Trump \u2019 s tactics could be uncomfortable for those taking their turn \u201c in the bull \u2019 s-eye , \u201d such as Boeing or Carrier .\n\u201c If we combine that with policy of a very aggressive pro-job creation environment , I think we \u2019 re going to be happy with the end of that , \u201d said Mr. Oberhelman , who is chairman of Caterpillar Inc .\nMr. Trump didn \u2019 t go into details about the Boeing deal but said the price tag was just too big .\n\u201c We want Boeing to make a lot of money , but not that much money , \u201d he told reporters during an earlier appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower .\nTrump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said that the details of budget-cutting decisions would be announced after Mr. Trump takes office Jan. 20 . In the meantime , he said , the president-elect was signaling his intention to be a careful steward of taxpayer dollars .\n\u201c The message is clearly been sent that we are going to look to save taxpayers \u2019 money , \u201d he said . \u201c People are really frustrated with some of the big price tags that are coming out for programs , even in addition to this one . So we are going to look for areas where we can keep costs down and look for ways where we can save money . \u201d\nIn a statement responding to Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweet , Boeing said its current contract is only worth $ 170 million , presumably not including sunk costs and later contracts should the program come to fruition .\n\u201c We are currently under contract for $ 170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States . We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer , \u201d the statement said .\nThe presidential aircraft is more expensive than a 747 made for one of the airlines because of the advanced communications equipment , security measures and other special features that make Air Force One a flying Oval Office .\nAerospace industry expert Richard Aboulafia called Mr. Trump \u2019 s criticism of the cost \u201c complete madness . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s actually what it costs to have two airplanes that can survive a nuclear war and transport the president in times of national emergency , and any other time for that matter , \u201d he told Seattle \u2019 s Morning News . \u201c Is Boeing getting rich on this deal ? No , far from it . \u201d\nThe life span of the aircraft is about 30 years .
