And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests , including $ 15 million from Wall Street . \u201d\nFor her part , Clinton questioned Sanders \u2019 depth of knowledge , invoking a New York Daily News editorial board meeting in which the Vermont senator struggled to answer questions on breaking up big banks and on foreign policy . \u201c I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief , \u201d she said .\nClinton also reminded the audience of her connections to New York and to President Obama , whose legacy she says she would like to build upon . \u201c The people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator , \u201d she said . \u201c And President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of state for the United States . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s embrace of Obama throughout this primary process figures to help mobilize key coalitions that propelled his presidential victories , especially in the diverse and voter-rich New York City .
