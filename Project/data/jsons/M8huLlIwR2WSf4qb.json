    "content": "DES MOINES , Iowa \u2014 Joni Ernst promised to \u201c unload \u201d on Obamacare in a 2014 campaign ad that featured her firing a gun as a narrator described what she would do to the Democratic health care law .\nBut three years after winning election to the Senate on a vow to seek an \u201c immediate '' repeal of the law , the Iowa senator is being very careful about pulling that trigger .\n\u201c I am legitimately undecided on this , \u201d she said here Friday after relentless attempts by questioners in the state \u2019 s two largest cities to pin her down on the health care bill under consideration in the House in the state \u2019 s two largest cities . \u201c And you will hear that from a number of my colleagues , as well . \u201d\nErnst was part of a Republican wave election that year that brought 12 new GOP members to the Senate and secured a Republican majority . Without exception , the winners used the unpopular law and its bungled launch to propel them to victory .\nBut as Obamacare \u2019 s popularity has improved , those same senators are now among the most prominent critics of the Republican proposal to undo the law being pushed by Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump . A Congressional Budget Office estimate this week that the plan would leave 24 million more people uninsured and increase premiums in the short term has only heightened the anxiety .\nIndeed , now Ernst is using the word \u201c deliberative \u201d when describing her state of mind about replacing Obamacare . She emphasizes that pre-existing conditions must be covered and that children up to the age of 26 be able to remain on their parents \u2019 insurance plan , both of which the Republican alternative would require .\nErnst insists she still wants to dismantle the law , but admits it \u2019 s not quite as simple as the \u201c repeal and replace \u201d mantra seemed in 2014 .\n\u201c We have to take this up and move cautiously , \u201d she said after an event in Cedar Rapids , a Democratic bastion . \u201c When digging into it , it is much more complicated than simply saying \u2018 repeal Obamacare . \u2019 \u201d\nHealth care is clearly top of mind in Iowa , where about 150,000 Iowans have benefitted from the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and nearly 50,000 more have used subsidies to buy healthcare on the Obamcare exchanges . While the longtime swing state has veered more firmly into the Republican column the past two election cycles , how Ernst handles the Obamacare debate could determine just how tough a reelection challenge she receives in 2020 .\n\u201c You \u2019 re talking about people getting kicked off health care . If Medicaid is rolled back and Ernst votes for it , they \u2019 re going to have a reason to be mad , \u201d said Brad Anderson , Barack Obama \u2019 s Iowa director in 2012 .\nWhat \u2019 s remarkable is that Ernst \u2019 s ambivalence about the current repeal plan is echoed by a majority of the Senate Republican class of 2014 , by and large a very conservative bunch . They \u2019 re now threatening to make Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2019 s life far more difficult if and when the House sends over its plan to roll back Obamacare \u2019 s Medicaid expansion and replace its subsidies with skimpier tax credits .\nSens . Cory Gardner of Colorado and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia are balking at plans to reverse the Medicaid expansion . Sens .
