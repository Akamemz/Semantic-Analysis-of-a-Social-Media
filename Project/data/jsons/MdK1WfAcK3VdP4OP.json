After months of jostling behind the scenes with Jeb Bush and the rest of the 2016 field in the invisible primary for donors , endorsements , money and momentum , Rubio is pivoting toward a more public-facing campaign . His focus is finally shifting from political influencers to the voters themselves .\nHe blitzed through New Hampshire on Monday , will campaign in South Carolina on Tuesday and then fly to Alabama , which votes on March 1 and where he will hold a rally , his first public event there this cycle . Rubio began to pick up the pace just before Thanksgiving , spending more time in Iowa just before the holiday \u2014 five straight days \u2014 than he had in the entire first six months of 2015 . He \u2019 ll be back again in New Hampshire later this week , too .\nThe aggressive public travel schedule is being paired with a flood of new television ads . This week , his campaign is blanketing the Iowa and New Hampshire airwaves in full force for the first time \u2014 with more than $ 700,000 in TV ads across the two states . His super PAC , meanwhile , released its first ad of the campaign on Monday .\nIt \u2019 s the clearest signal yet that the low-profile period of Rubio \u2019 s campaign is over , as his campaign terrain shifts from boardrooms to barns like the one in Rye . The senator \u2019 s advisers believe much of the 2016 race is being defined by free media coverage and , with just over two months until voting begins , Rubio \u2019 s team wants such coverage to pair with his ads , especially in the early-voting states .\n\u201c We can be the authors of the greatest chapter in the amazing story of America , \u201d Rubio declared Monday at a \u201c No BS BBQ \u201d hosted by former Sen.
