''\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney released the videos earlier Saturday . One was taken from a dashboard camera and the other from a police body camera .\nNeither video shows Scott , 43 , holding or pointing a gun at officers \u2014 but both show him walking back from police before he was shot after being repeatedly told to drop a weapon .\nPutney also released photographs of a gun that he said was found at the scene and an ankle holster they said belonged to Scott .\nThe family saw those photographs for the first time , attorney Justin Bamberg said .\n`` This is our first time seeing a photograph of not just that gun , but the holster and everything else , '' he told reporters .

''\nThe videos , he added , proved that Scott was `` absolutely not '' holding a gun when he exited his white SUV .\n`` From the dash-cam or the body-cam , you ca n't clearly identify what , if anything , is in his hand \u2014 and that has not changed . ''\nBamberg also zeroed in on the time lapse between when Scott left the vehicle and the moment he lay dead on the parking lot of his apartment complex .\n`` When you look at this dash-cam footage , when you look at the time frame between Mr. Scott stepping out of his vehicle , to the moment he unfortunately passes away on the pavement , it is that do those actions , those precious seconds , justify the shooting ?\n`` That is the most important question that has to be answered , '' Bamberg said .\n`` What we see when we look at this dash-cam video is that Mr. Scott steps out of the vehicle .
