The commutation allowed Stone to avoid a 40-month prison sentence after he was convicted for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign.\n\nThe move was well within the scope of the pardon powers granted to the president in the Constitution, but it was still met with harsh criticism. Stone\u2019s connection to the investigation directed at the president represents \u201cunprecedented, historic corruption,\u201d Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for legislation that would prevent presidents from using their pardon power to protect themselves from criminal prosecution.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first president to court controversy with his pardons.

Bush cleared Reagan-era officials in the Iran-Contra scandal. Bill Clinton even pardoned his own half-brother.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nTo some legal experts, Trump using pardon power to reward political allies and alleged co-conspirators is the continuation of a trend that has seen the authority drift further and further away from the intentions of the Founding Fathers. Pardons were designed to be a way for the executive branch to balance against abuses by the judiciary. Today, it\u2019s more often used to undermine legitimate prosecutions, critics say.
