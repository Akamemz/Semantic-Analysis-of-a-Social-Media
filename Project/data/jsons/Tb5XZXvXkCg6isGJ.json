    "content": "The White House is under intensified pressure to hit pause on the rollout of ObamaCare as evidence mounts that officials knew well ahead of time of major problems in the new health care law and its implementation -- raising questions whether the administration went ahead , nonetheless , for political purposes .\n`` One year delay of the mandate and he would have avoided a lot of this , '' Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe question remains whether President Obama might still decide to delay the requirement on individuals to buy insurance and possibly more . He 's getting hammered by not just lawmakers but the mainstream media , including typically friendly publications ; the new cover of Time magazine shows a cracked `` ObamaCare '' pill above the blaring headline : `` Broken Promise ''\nIf the president does delay the law , Republicans would surely use the buckle to hammer Democrats going into the 2014 mid-terms .
