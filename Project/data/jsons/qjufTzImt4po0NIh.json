This gives him both increasing momentum and legitimacy , both of which will be crucial in a potential contested convention . If everything goes Cruz \u2019 s way , he \u2019 ll pull close to even with Trump before Cleveland and subsequently win the support of delegates for Rubio and John Kasich .

He is determined to lose no time in these relatively empty weeks , which might be described as the ducks-swimming-around phase of the campaign\u2014quiet and boring on top but with furious paddling below the waterline . The game now depends heavily on backroom maneuvering for delegates . Cruz \u2019 s team is exceptionally disciplined and competent at this , having mastered every arcane rule of the nominating process .

They have an alliance , after all , on one important aim : keeping anyone else from becoming the nominee . If convention procedures are honored , then delegates must abide by Rule 40 ( b ) , which stipulates that only candidates who have won a majority of delegates in eight or more states may be presented for nomination . That would eliminate Kasich or some other white knight ( Paul Ryan seems to be out of the running ) and leaves only Trump and Cruz . If the two men hold firm , asking their delegates to uphold the rule , then at least one of them will walk out the nominee . Sure , Cruz views Trump as an uncontrolled mess , but he knows the two can do business . He also recognizes a fellow rascal and can not get convincingly worked up about him . Unlike Trump , Cruz thinks less about whether a line of attack is fair and more about whether it works , and that applies to both outgoing and incoming fire . It \u2019 s all business .\nCruz is also in touch with Rubio , who , despite pledges to campaign across the country in a pickup truck to stop Trump , has not yet been spotted in a Chevy dealership .
