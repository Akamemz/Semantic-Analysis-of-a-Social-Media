They had been in a cell ever since waiting for the Border Patrol to process them . But with groups of 80 to 90 people asking border agents to arrest them everyday , the system has been overwhelmed . There is just no place to house everyone until their case can be adjudicated so the Border Patrol is simply letting them go with a promise that they voluntarily report to immigration officials weeks later .\n`` Within hours of arriving , '' the Chronicle reports , `` Lanza borrowed a cellphone in the bus terminal . His wife called her sister in North Carolina , who paid for their fare to Greenville . They had tickets for the last bus out that night , leaving at 11:30 . ''\nThe Obama administration claims that this flood of families coming to Texas is being caused by recent violence in Central American countries . But Central America is no stranger to turmoil . The flow of minors coming to the United States illegally has been pretty steady for over a decade .\nThe Christian Science Monitor reports that , `` During the decade preceding fiscal year 2012 , the federal government agency tasked with caring for unaccompanied minors who cross the border illegally dealt with an average of 7,000 to 8,000 cases a year ... In fiscal year 2011 , the number was 6,560 . The following year , however , the number jumped to 13,625 . This fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 , 2014 , federal officials are estimating that the number could be 80,000 , according to an internal memo cited by The New York Times . ''\nHmmm ... What happened in 2012 that would cause the number of unaccompanied minors who illegally cross the border to more than double that year and then increase exponentially after that ? From CSM :\nAt issue is Mr. Obama 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) , which in 2012 allowed some undocumented immigrants who came to America as minors to defer deportation for two years . Last week , the administration announced guidelines for how these immigrants could defer deportation for a further two years .\nOf course , nothing was ever temporary about the DACA program . The two year time limit Obama created from thin air made no sense logically or morally at the time , and it makes no more sense today . That is why the news that he re-upped the status for another two years made such little news last week . Everybody expected it .\nBut just as the time limits for `` temporary status '' through DACA make no logical , moral , or practical , sense , none of the other arbitrary lines in the program do either .

Why isn \u2019 t someone whose age 31 who has gone all the same ... who has spent all these years in the United States and gone to school and had a job or served in the military why not ... why isn \u2019 t he or she eligible ? Munoz : Well if you look at the version of the DREAM Act that passed the House of Representatives in 2010 , the cutoff date in that legislation was the age of 30 so there has been some discussion about a similar population of young people and that is where the discussion landed .\nBut the DREM Act 's age 30 cutoff makes no more sense than Obama 's . Why should n't those illegal immigrants who entered the country before December 31 , 2011 , which is the cut off date in S. 744 , also be eligible ? What is the moral case for letting someone who arrived in 2010 stay , but deporting the Lanzas who arrived just last week ?\nThere is none . And that is the lie that is at the core of every amnesty program , from the DREAM Act , to DACA , to S. 744 : the randomly chosen date that divides non-citizens who will be rewarded for illegally entering the U.S. , from those who didn \u2019 t illegally enter the United States soon enough . That line just simply is n't credible . There simply is no moral or logical reason to reward the first group and punish the second .\nAnd that is what Central Americans have figured out . They know that if President Obama wo n't deport DACA eligible immigrants today , he wo n't deport new arrivals tomorrow either .
