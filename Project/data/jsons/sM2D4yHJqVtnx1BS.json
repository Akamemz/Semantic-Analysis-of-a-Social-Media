Qasem Soleimani .\nShortly after the story of Iran \u2019 s counter-attack broke on Tuesday , Carlson hosted a show that mixed coverage of the story as details became known , emphasizing early reports of a lack of American casualties , and interviews with experts on the Middle East . Some of those guests pointed out the dangers of spiraling escalation .\n\u201c I continue to believe the president doesn \u2019 t want a full-blown war , \u201d Carlson said . \u201c Some around him might , but I think most sober people don \u2019 t want that . \u201d\nTrump , who announced his decision not to retaliate against Iran \u2019 s missile strikes in a nationally televised address 14 hours later , told some close to him that he watched Carlson \u2019 s show , according to BuzzFeed News . He told confidants in recent days that Carlson \u2019 s strong advocacy not to escalate the situation in Iran played a role in his decision-making , two White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Thursday .\nTrump keeps a close eye on how his base responds to policy decisions , feeling their beliefs are often reflected and influenced by Fox News hosts . His Twitter feed reflects how he keeps close tabs on Fox , and he tweeted a link to a Carlson piece on Monday night .\nThe president often consults with Fox News hosts off-air , including Carlson . Carlson was seen among the president \u2019 s entourage this past summer when he visited the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea . He conducted an interview with Trump that was later shown on Fox .\nFollowing Trump \u2019 s announcement on Wednesday , Carlson said that \u201c we \u2019 re back from the brink. \u201d He played a clip of the president \u2019 s speech where he said that a pause in hostilities between Iran and the United States was a very good thing for the world .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a big claim but in this case it is not an overstatement , \u201d Carlson said .\nHis show moved on to a new cause , in this case encouraging the U.S. to leave neighboring Iraq .\nHe was calm on Tuesday \u2019 s show , at a time there was breathless coverage elsewhere of the missile attack . A succession of guests threw cold water on the idea of further retaliation . Gil Barndollar of Defense Priorities suggested Americans were kidding themselves if they expected to incite a regime-change movement in Iran . With Kelley Vlahos , executive editor of The American Conservative magazine , they speculated on the role of Democrats and Trump staffers who didn \u2019 t have the president \u2019 s best interests in mind in advocating war with Iran . Trump was reminded that he was elected on a pledge to get Americans out of foreign entanglements .\nA frequent Carlson guest , retired Army Col.
