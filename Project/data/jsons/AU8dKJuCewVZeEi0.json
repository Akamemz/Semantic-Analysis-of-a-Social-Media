    "content": "On Dec. 3 , 1986 , Sen. John Glenn of Ohio spoke in Akron at a memorial service for Judith Resnik , one of the astronauts lost in the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger .\nBoth Senator Glenn and Ms. Resnik were Ohio natives . He knew her \u2013 when applying to be an astronaut , she had sought him out and asked what qualities NASA was looking for . She \u2019 d visited him in his Senate office after her first space flight .\nGlenn told the crowd at Firestone High \u2013 Resnik \u2019 s alma mater \u2013 that he \u2019 d come not to mourn but to celebrate her life . \u201c Let \u2019 s never forget the last words that came from that spacecraft : \u2018 Go at throttle up , \u2019 \u201d he said .\n\u201c Those words are far more than a courageous epitaph , \u201d Glenn said . \u201c They are America \u2019 s history . They are America \u2019 s destiny . And they will turn tragedy into triumph once again . \u201d\nThrottle up . Perhaps no two words better define the life of John Glenn himself , who passed away Thursday in Columbus , Ohio . A war hero , test pilot , space pioneer , and a Buckeye political icon , Glenn lived life like he flew , stick back and nose climbing , looking at the stars .\nConsider his famous Mercury space flight of Feb. 20 , 1962 . As hard is it may be to believe today , there were no real computers in his crammed Friendship 7 capsule . Glenn had to take manual control when systems malfunctioned . He completed only three of eight planned earth orbits .\nThen a light indicated the capsule \u2019 s protective heat shield might be loose . Houston ground control ordered that retro rockets strapped around the shield not be jettisoned , to provide extra protection during the fiery descent into the atmosphere .\nFlaming chunks of metal flew by Glenn \u2019 s window as he plunged towards earth . He didn \u2019 t know if they were extra bits of rocket or the crucial shield . They were the former . He lived .\n\u201c That was a real fireball , boy , \u201d said Glenn to ground control after the incident was over .\nOr look at his entry to electoral politics . He ran for an Ohio Senate seat in 1970 , but lost the Democratic primary to Howard Metzenbaum . In 1974 he tried again , and again faced Metzenbaum in the primary . Metzenbaum gave a speech in which he charged that Glenn , who \u2019 d served in the military and then worked for NASA , had never held a \u201c real job . \u201d\nUmbrage was taken . In a debate , Glenn ripped into his opponent . He noted that he \u2019 d been a Marine for 23 years , through two wars and 149 missions . His plane had been hit by antiaircraft fire 12 times . Then he \u2019 d been an original member of the space program . His life , not his checkbook , had always been on the line .\n\u201c You go with me on Memorial Day coming up , and you stand in Arlington National Cemetery , where I have more friends than I \u2019 d like to remember , and you watch those waving flags . You stand there , and you think about this nation , and you tell me that those people didn \u2019 t have a job , \u201d said Glenn .\nHe won , and served as an Ohio Senator for 25 years , leaving office on Jan. 2 , 1999 .\nHe was not a natural politician , as events proved . He ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1984 as a centrist but lost to the liberal Minnesotan Walter Mondale . But he was a natural aviator . The sky was his element . Speed was his companion .\nAs a small boy growing up in small New Concord , Ohio , in the 1920s he \u2019 d hold a small plane with a propeller out the window of the car as his dad drove and watch the prop spin . When he got a little older he \u2019 d build his own models \u2013 flying ones , constructed methodically of balsa and tissue and glue and rubber bands .\n\u201c I \u2019 d fly them , and they \u2019 d crash , and I \u2019 d repair them and fly them again , they \u2019 d crash , \u201d Glenn said in a 1997 NASA oral history .\nHe thought he \u2019 d never learn to really fly . It was too expensive . But when he attended Muskingum College in New Concord , Ohio , World War II was approaching . The US government started a program that helped young men with flight training in small light planes . Glenn learned in a Taylorcraft with a 65-horsepower Lycoming engine .\n\u201c I thought that was too good a chance to miss , and so I took that , \u201d he said in 1997 .\nHe would fly small planes all his life . For decades , he and his wife Annie commuted from Washington to Ohio in their twin-engine Beechcraft Baron . He finally sold it in 2012 because it was getting more difficult for the couple to clamber in . At the time , he was 90 .\nAfter Pearl Harbor , the young Glenn quickly volunteered for service . He was in flight training for a year and then flying close-support missions as a Marine pilot in the Pacific . He accumulated 3,000 hours in the iconic gull-wing Corsair fighter .\nAfter World War II , he decided to stay in the military . He was good at flying , he thought . He checked out on jets , volunteered to fly with the Air Force ( as a Marine on loan ) and ended up in Korea , flying F-86s against MiGs .\nTactics were still from World War II , or even World War I . Aircraft were still armed with guns . They didn \u2019 t have radars . Everything was visual . But jet speed was much faster . If you were flying 500 miles per hour towards an opponent , and the opponent was doing the same thing towards you , the closing speed was 1,000 miles per hour .\n\u201c There was lots of real wild flying , \u201d Glenn noted in 1997 .\nGlenn shot down three MiGs in the last nine days of the war . After the armistice , he ended up a test pilot at Patuxent Naval Air Station on the Chesapeake Bay . In 1957 he flew an F8U-Crusader in \u201c Project Bullet , \u201d the first supersonic transcontinental flight . He made it from New York to California in just a tick over three hours and 23 minutes .\nThen came NASA . As a test pilot with combat experience in superior physical condition ( he could still do 75 pushups at age 75 ) , Glenn was a natural pick as a member of the first group of American astronauts , the Mercury 7 .\nAs depicted by author Tom Wolfe in his book \u201c The Right Stuff , \u201d Glenn was somewhat pious , a sober and more politically-minded member of the astronaut corps who scolded some of the others about escapades he thought might look bad if they got into the press .\n\u201c He looked like a balding and slightly tougher version of the cutest-looking freckle-faced country boy you ever saw , \u201d Wolfe wrote .\nGlenn later said he thought Wolfe \u2019 s portrait of him and the others was pretty accurate , though the conflict was exaggerated . He had little use for the movie version of the book , though , labeling it \u201c lousy . \u201d\nHe lobbied for the nation \u2019 s first space flight . Perhaps he lobbied a bit too hard \u2013 the honor went to Alan Shepard . Gus Grissom was next . But Glenn was the first American to orbit the earth , following the Soviet Gherman Titov .\nThe impact of Glenn \u2019 s feat was tremendous . Crowds jammed into public spaces to watch the flight \u2019 s progress en masse on still-novel television screens .

Glenn was the hero the nation needed . He addressed a joint session of Congress . Four million people cheered as he and Annie rode up the canyons of Manhattan in a convertible for a ticker-tape parade .\nHe wanted to go back .
