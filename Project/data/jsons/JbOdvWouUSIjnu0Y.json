    "content": "GARISSA , Kenya \u2014 Tension and anxiety remained high Friday as the Kenyan military launched a campaign to flush out terrorists linked to the Garissa University College massacre .\nThe campaign came as Kenyan Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett imposed a curfew on the borderlands with Somalia from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time .\nFew businesses remained open early on Friday evening before the curfew took hold . Some said the heavily armed Kenyan troops were overly zealous in rooting out Al Shabaab terrorists who have claimed responsibility for the attacks .\n`` It 's not safe here for us as residents , '' said Abdikadir Adolwa . `` The soldiers are whipping residents to force them to identify terrorists . The military have terrorized this area and we fear going to the streets of the town . ''\nMany residents who could stay outside the town opted to leave while the troops were present .\n`` They 're arresting people who have no national identity cards , '' said Nathar Abdkir Balza , a mother of five , who owns a hotel in Garissa . `` You can be arrested for loitering . ''\nEthnic Somalis especially have deserted the area . Al Shabaab hails from nearby Somalia .\n`` The Somalis like miraa but they are now afraid to come to town and buy it , '' said Kevin Kariuki , who sells miraa , or khat , an African plant that has slightly intoxicating effects when chewed .\nEarlier Friday , the Kenyan government appealed for help in capturing nine men , described as `` bloodthirsty , armed and dangerous , '' in the wake of an attack on Garissa University that left 148 people dead .\nAttackers from the Somali-based terror group al-Shabab told university students before they were killed that `` this is the beginning of more attacks '' targeting schools and universities in the country , the Kenya-based Standard reported .\nThe four gunmen were killed Thursday as security forces moved to end the 15-hour siege , which appeared to target Christians and Islamic converts . Two security guards , one policeman and one soldier were among the dead . At least 79 people were injured , and more than 500 students held hostage were rescued .\nInterior Minister Joseph Nkaissery updated the casualties figures Friday , saying the gunmen killed 148 people . He said 142 of the dead were students , three were policemen and three were soldiers . Nkaissery added that 104 people were wounded .\nSurvivor Claire Mumo , a student , was in the college when the terrorists attacked on Thursday .\n`` I was woken up by gunshot sounds inside our dormitory . The four gunmen I noticed ordered everybody to lie down before they started shooting at us , '' said Mumo . `` The blood of my friend spilled on my head when she was shot . The gunmen thought they had shot and killed me . ''\nThe gunmen left her alone because they thought she was already dead , she said . As she lay on the floor , she heard them carry out their plans .\n`` I heard them asking and separating Muslims and Christians students . Then shortly I heard sounds of gunshots , '' Mumo added . `` I only came out when I saw our security forces collecting bodies . I will never forget this attack . I 'm lucky to be alive . ''\nSurvivor Helen Titus said one of the first things that the al-Shabab gunmen did when they entered the campus early Thursday was to head for a lecture hall where Christians were in prayer . Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group with ties to al-Qaida .\n`` They investigated our area . They knew everything , '' Titus told The Associated Press outside a hospital in Garissa where she was being treated for a bullet wound to the wrist .\nTitus , a 21-year-old English literature student , said she smeared blood from classmates on her face and hair and lay still at one point in hopes the gunmen would think she was dead .\nThe gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out , assuring them that they would not be killed , said Titus , who wore a patient 's gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard .\n`` We just wondered whether to come out or not , '' she said . Many students did , whereupon the gunmen started shooting men , saying they would not kill `` ladies , '' Titus said . But they also shot women and targeted Christians , said Titus , who is a Christian .\nEsther Wanjiru said she was awake at the time of the attack . Asked if she lost anyone , she said : `` My best friend . ''\nAnother survivor , Nina Kozel , said she was awakened by screaming and that many students escaped by sprinting to the fences and jumping over them . Some suffered bruises , she said . Many men were unable to escape , and hid in vain under beds and in closets in their rooms , according to Kozel .\nThe mortuaries in Garissa , near the Somali border in northeastern Kenya , were so overwhelmed they had to ship many of the bodies to the capital of Nairobi , 200 miles away , the BBC reported .\nThe government began evacuating students who survived the Thursday terror attack , but many parents still do n't know about their fate of their children .\n`` I phoned my daughter Susan since yesterday in the morning when I received bad news about the attack , but she did n't pick my calls , '' said Eunice Wangari , a mother of three . `` I do n't know if she 's still alive or not . The government is taking too long to identify the bodies . I am very stressed .
