    "content_original": "Steve Strauss\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nMy millennial daughters were tear-gassed this week and I couldn\u2019t be prouder.\n\nMy wife and I, while both at high risk of COVID-19, also joined a march in our town, but in a less confrontational, safer way.\n\nSo, while my family is, like so many millions of us are, sympathetic and supportive of the history we see unfolding before our eyes, and outraged at the murder of yet another black man by an unfeeling white policeman, the solution of how to get to the promised land remains elusive.\n\nMy youngest daughter, far more radical than I, has fallen into the \u201cdefund the police\u201d camp. Our friendly debate quickly devolved into a shouting match, until we decided to try, as one of my heroes \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi \u2013 suggested, \u201cto be the change we want to see.\u201d\n\nWe calmed down. We talked. We listened. And I learned something.\n\nBuyer beware:What products were among those marketed with the most outrageous claims of all time?\n\nFood video crew standoff:Bon App\u00e9tit Test Kitchen members ask for salary changes for minorities\n\nWhat does 'defund the police' mean?\n\nDefunding the police, at least as I now understand it, certainly does not mean not having any police. That would of course be folly. But it does mean that some of the money used to fund police forces can likely be better spent if the goal is long-term safety, and to begin to eradicate the poverty gap and racial disparity between white and black America that fosters crime.\n\nDefunding the police means that we begin to look at where crime and a lack of opportunity begins and then reallocate more resources there instead. More money for interdiction, for social services, for better education, and, relevant for this column, for minority grants and loans to start small businesses.\n\nFunding changes could benefit small businesses\n\nTo me, there are few things we as a society can do better to equal the playing field than to increase funding and education for disadvantaged, would-be entrepreneurs generally, and African American entrepreneurs specifically.\n\nSmall business ownership creates wealth. It fosters pride. It enhances and stabilizes communities. It creates a tax base, and that in turn helps fund better schools.\n\nThe ripples that result from small business ownership positively affect the entire community. Small business ripples create jobs. There are ripples of hope and pride as once-blighted neighborhoods are revitalized. Money flows. Opportunity grows.\n\nSo yes, one answer is money, specifically, increased funding for grants and loans to minority small-business owners. It is much needed.\n\nRacial wealth gap needs narrowing\n\nAccording to The Aspen Institute, \u201cHispanic and black Americans have levels of net worth that are only one-tenth of those held by white Americans, and fewer of their assets are in the form of business assets. Specifically, while white and Asian Americans hold one-third of their assets in business and financial assets, Hispanics and blacks hold only 15% and 8%, respectively, of their wealth in these forms.\u201d (emphasis added.)\n\nJust consider the name of the report this quote comes from: \u201cBRIDGING THE DIVIDE: How Business Ownership Can Help Close the Racial Wealth Gap.\u201d\n\nThe stats from the report speak for themselves:\n\n\u201cIn 2004, families in which the head of the household was self-employed had a median net worth five times that of households in which the head worked for someone else.\u201d\n\nthat of households in which the head worked for someone else.\u201d \u201cWhile black entrepreneurs have levels of wealth mobility equal to those of white entrepreneurs, white workers have greater wealth mobility than black workers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe answer then is clear: Black workers need to become black entrepreneurs.\n\nBut how do they do that?
