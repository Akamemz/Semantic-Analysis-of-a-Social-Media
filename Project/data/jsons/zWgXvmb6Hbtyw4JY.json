So it was for Marco Rubio , who lost his own state , Florida , to Donald Trump on Tuesday night in the Republican primary . As Rubio did n't even bother running again for Senate \u2014 reports say that he hates being a senator \u2014 this could be the end of his time in public office , at least for now . The defeat was absolute . Florida is a winner-takes-all-state for the Republicans , but it hardly mattered , as Rubio could barely eke out a little more than 1 in 4 Republican votes .\nUnburdened by the need to win elections , any election , Rubio issued a concession speech that was an unsubtle rebuke to Trump . `` America 's in the middle of a real political storm , a real tsunami , '' he said , concluding sadly , `` and we should have seen this coming . ''\nAfter arguing that `` American needs a vibrant conservative movement . '' Rubio railed , `` But one that 's built on principles and on ideas . Not on fear . Not on anger . Not on preying on people 's frustrations . ''\nRubio is an empty shell , a robot who mostly runs on programs that his funders and campaign staff input in him . But for a small , sad moment , you saw a bit of the human being lurking under that glib armor . We glimpsed Rubio 's soul . A soul really , really hates Trump . One mildly hopes , before he shuffles off into obscurity , Rubio has it in him to preserve his dignity by refusing to support Trump in the general . It would be a small victory , but better than whatever hell Chris Christie is living through now .\nFor most of Trump 's celebratory speech in Florida , it seemed the candidate was going to ignore the controversies of the week , focusing on important-sounding issues like trade that have nothing to do with why his supporters actually love him . But just as a hundred pundits started to type out `` pivoting to the general , '' the real Trump came sneaking out .\n`` Then Paris happened , '' he started , crediting terrorist attacks in France and San Bernardino , California for the surge in the polls that made him a contender .\n`` We need protection in our country , and that 's going to happen , '' he continued . `` and then the poll numbers just shot up .

But even scarier was the possibility that the events in Chicago , where Trump seemingly manipulated events to create a near-riot , would give his campaign a boost .
