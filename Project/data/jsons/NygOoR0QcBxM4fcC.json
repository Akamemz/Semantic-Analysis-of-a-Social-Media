And the companies are putting their money where their mouths are . \u2588\u2588\u2588 NETWORK\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 President Trump 's order banning immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. began hitting the tech industry Saturday , with Google 's CEO leading a growing list of tech executives condemning the ban .\nThe CEOs of Microsoft , Apple , Netflix , Uber , Airbnb and Tesla Motors denounced with the policy , which would affect their own employees working here legally , as well as their competitive quest for talent .\nAirbnb CEO Brian Chesky went a step further , offering free housing to anyone displaced by the ban .\nSeveral tech leaders expressed concern that the ban could wreak havoc on their businesses .\n`` Trump 's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world , and are so un-American it pains us all , '' Netflix CEO and founder Reed Hastings said in a Facebook post . `` It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity . ''\nIn a staff memo , Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the move affects at least 187 of the Internet giant 's staff .\n`` We \u2019 re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families , or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S. , '' Google said in a statement . `` We 'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere . ''\nThe president 's executive order suspends the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days , halts the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq , Syria , Iran , Sudan , Libya , Somalia and Yemen .\nThe order made good on one of Trump 's most controversial campaign promises , a series of Muslim-focused restrictions he says should prevent terrorists from entering U.S. soil . For many of his supporters , preventing or delaying legal immigrants from returning to high-paid tech jobs , which they say should go to U.S.-born workers anyway , is a small price to pay for the promise of more security .\nThe move is already roiling the tech industry , with affected employees being urged to return to the U.S. and consult with corporate immigration experts .\nInternet Association President and CEO Michael Beckerman said the Internet industry is `` deeply concerned '' by Trump 's order .\n`` While this order impacts many companies outside of the tech industry , Internet companies in particular thrive in the U.S. because the best and the brightest are able to create innovative products and services right here in America , '' Beckerman said in an emailed statement . `` While we support President Trump \u2019 s efforts to grow our economy and allow \u2018 people of great talent \u2019 to come into the U.S. , the executive order signed yesterday has troubling consequences . ''\nThe ban includes green card holders who are authorized to live and work in the United States , according to a Homeland Security spokeswoman , Reuters reported . Some immigrants with legal visas trying to return to the U.S. from trips abroad were also detained , according to news reports .\nThe Executive Order 's humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting . We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the U.S. https : //t.co/HdwVGzIECt \u2014 jack ( @ jack ) January 28 , 2017\n`` The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country \u2019 s challenges , '' Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and an adviser to President Trump said on Twitter . `` Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S . They 've done right , not wrong & do n't deserve to be rejected . ''\nThe blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country \u2019 s challenges \u2014 Elon Musk ( @ elonmusk ) January 29 , 2017\nIn a memo sent to Google employees first reported by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal , Pichai said one employee was rushing back from a trip to New Zealand before the order was assigned , while two others were grappling with what this might mean to their families .\nA similar situation was playing out at other tech companies .\nMicrosoft said it 's providing legal advice and assistance to its employees affected by the executive order .\n`` We share the concerns about the impact of the executive order on our employees from the listed countries , all of whom have been in the United States lawfully , '' the tech giant said in a statement .\nAccording to Microsoft 's general counsel Brad Smith , 76 Microsoft employees are citizens with a U.S. visa from the affected countries .\n`` We \u2019 ve already contacted everyone in this group , '' he told employees in a memo . `` But there may be other employees from these countries who have U.S. green cards rather than a visa who may be affected , and there may be family members from these countries that we haven \u2019 t yet reached . ''\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a LinkedIn post that his company would `` continue to advocate on this important topic . ''\n`` As an immigrant and as a CEO , I \u2019 ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company , for the country , and for the world , '' Nadella said .\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick told employees he would raise the immigration ban on Friday when he takes part in President Trump 's first business advisory group meeting .\n`` While every government has their own immigration controls , allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S. \u2019 s policy since its founding . That means this ban will impact many innocent people , '' Kalanick said .\nApple CEO Tim Cook was in Washington , D.C. , where he has been meeting with GOP lawmakers and with Trump 's daughter Ivanka and her husband , Jared Kushner .\nIn a memo to employees , he said `` it is not a policy we support . ''\n`` In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week , I \u2019 ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration \u2014 both to our company and to our nation \u2019 s future . Apple would not exist without immigration , let alone thrive and innovate the way we do , '' Cook wrote , according to a memo sent to employees worldwide and obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant .\nFor Box CEO Aaron Levie , the Trump order also hit home . One of the founders of the cloud-based storage and services company is Iranian-American and Box is currently trying to assess how many of its employees are affected .\n`` At the corporate level , we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now , '' Levie said . `` We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation , what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process . ''\nMore broadly , the order sends `` the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country , '' Levie said , turning away refugees and doing nothing to make Americans safer . `` It 's very unfortunate and very disappointing , '' he said .\nMy grandfather came from Poland between the wars , at 17 , sponsored by an elder sister . Two more siblings made it . Everyone else died . \u2014 Stewart Butterfield ( @ stewart ) January 28 , 2017\n`` Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit , but , does n't matter : do the right thing because it 's right , '' he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter . `` My grandfather came from Poland between the wars , at 17 , sponsored by an elder sister .
