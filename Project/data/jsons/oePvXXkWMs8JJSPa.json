    "content": "When the House broke for its August recess , Republican Rep. John Fleming went home to Louisiana to connect with voters . He got an earful .\nHe traveled the state , and whether he spoke with a lowly company employee , a middle manager , or a business owner , they all said the same thing : \u201c They are very disappointed in how we Republicans are doing in Washington , \u201d says Rep. Fleming , a physician elected in 2008 .\nFleming says his constituents see a GOP-controlled Congress failing to check President Obama , even as federal regulations are hurting them personally . It doesn \u2019 t matter to them that the president has veto power , or that Democrats can still block Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate .\n\u201c They just don \u2019 t want to hear that . That \u2019 s an excuse to them , \u201d he says in an interview . \u201c They at least want a fight . \u201d\nIn January , he and eight other hard-line Republicans formed the House Freedom Caucus to challenge the GOP leadership , which they claim is not fighting hard enough for Republican priorities . Now they \u2019 re bigger and they 're emboldened . They just succeeded in driving out Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio , who recently stunned Washington with the news that he will retire from Congress on Oct. 30 .\nIn the weeks ahead , the Freedom Caucus will have plentiful opportunities to push the fight further \u2013 from the speaker 's race to a combustible mix of fiscal deadlines this fall . Though members say they have not yet settled on a strategy , one thing is certain : They are not afraid of government shutdowns , fiscal cliffs , or any other hardline tactics that typically made Boehner wince .\nRepublicans have not gotten what they wanted , they say , not because these gambits failed , but rather because leadership did n't commit to them , heart and soul .\nFor this invitation-only group of about 40 members , which meets regularly at a Capitol Hill restaurant called the Tortilla Coast , the fight starts with the GOP 's election for the speakership and other GOP leadership offices , which will take place in a secret ballot on Thursday .\nMr. Boehner said he wanted to spare his members and the institution the \u201c turmoil \u201d of an expected attempt to oust him . But to many conservatives , like the members of the Freedom Caucus , turmoil is not the problem . They want real change in the top-down way the House is run and are making demands .\nThat pressure bubbled over Sunday when Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( R ) of Utah suddenly joined the race , challenging Boehner \u2019 s presumed successor , Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( R ) of California . Congressman Chaffetz says he was `` recruited '' as an alternative to majority leader McCarthy . He doubts Boehner \u2019 s right-hand man can get enough conservatives to win a final floor vote for speaker without having to rely on Democrats . That vote will occur at the end of the month .\n`` You do n't just give an automatic promotion to the existing leadership team , '' Chaffetz said on `` Fox News Sunday . '' Voters \u201c want us to take that fight to the Senate . They want us to take that fight to the president . \u201d\nBeyond the race for the speakership , the House has a to-do list chock full of pressure points for the Freedom Caucus , including debt , budget , and tax deadlines . Many in Washington are quaking over the deadlines . They remember previous cliff-hanger negotiations between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress . They wonder whether the Freedom Caucus will trigger a government shutdown over federal funding for Planned Parenthood , the way hardliners did over Obamacare in 2013 .\nCaucus members see the coming weeks as an opportunity . Exactly what their fight will look like \u201c is kind of fluid , \u201d says Rep. Matt Salmon ( R ) of Arizona , another caucus founder . But \u201c as we go forward , we \u2019 re going to consider anything and everything , \u201d he said last week .\nWhether Republicans are fighting hard enough for their priorities is a matter of opinion , and forms a dividing line in the party that runs from voters , to Congress , to the presidential race .\nSixty percent of Republican voters say they feel \u201c betrayed \u201d by their political party , according to a September Fox News poll . Two-thirds of GOP primary voters do not believe Republican majorities have done enough to block Obama \u2019 s agenda , the poll finds .\n\u201c It \u2019 s somewhat subjective , 'Did you fight hard enough for your priorities ? ' With Boehner , the answer is , \u2018 No , you didn \u2019 t , \u2019 \u201d says Matt Kibbe , the former head of the tea party advocacy group Freedom Works .\nMr. Kibbe is the kind of person Boehner means when he rails against \u201c false prophets \u201d who gin up the base with unrealistic promises . The speaker blames outside groups such as Freedom Works and Heritage Action for egging on the 2013 shutdown , a strategy he says was doomed to fail . He and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell ( R ) of Kentucky have since vowed not to repeat a shutdown .\nBut Kibbe says it is Boehner who is the false prophet , promising in the 2010 GOP \u201c Pledge to America \u201d to roll back spending to 2008 levels and to repeal Obamacare if the Republicans won the House .\n\u201c You have to believe that they never meant it , \u201d says Kibbe , who is now a senior adviser to Concerned American Voters , a super political action committee for GOP presidential candidate and libertarian , Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky .\n\u201c This idea that shutting down the government is a fundamental loser for Republicans \u2013 I just don \u2019 t buy it , \u201d Kibbe continues . He notes that it was only after the shutdowns of 1995 and early \u2019 96 that Republicans , under the leadership of Speaker Newt Gingrich , were able to strike a deal on welfare reform with President Clinton .\n\u201c Clinton took Gingrich seriously ; Obama has never taken Boehner seriously . \u201d\nFleming couldn \u2019 t agree more . He points to the stunning midterm election of 2014 , which returned a historic number of Republicans to the House and handed the Senate to GOP control \u2013 despite the shutdown the year before .\nRepublicans rarely put a bill on the president \u2019 s desk that he doesn \u2019 t like , Fleming complains . Indeed , the president has only vetoed four bills in his seven years in office \u2013 though he \u2019 s made plenty of veto threats .\n\u201c We could be getting more than we \u2019 re getting now , \u201d Fleming says . \u201c By raising the white flag before the discussion debate even begins , we \u2019 ve already lost . \u201d\nOther Republicans \u2013 hardly moderates \u2013 don \u2019 t see it that way .\nTake Grover Norquist , founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform .
