But his once-stout lead in the polls over Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli nearly vanished as voter outrage over the crash landing of ObamaCare nearly wrecked the race . A double-digit lead turned into a three-point scrape . Exit polls showed intense opposition to ObamaCare that helped Cuccinelli , who was written off by the national GOP and who had to lug along the scandal-plagued administration of Republican incumbent Gov .
