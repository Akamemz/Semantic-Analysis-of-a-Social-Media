A senior administration official would not confirm that information but confirmed that the breach occurred at the Office of Personnel Management .\nThe hackers are believed to have obtained data from a security intake form known as a Standard Form-86 , which includes details such as financial trouble , past convictions , drug use and close relationships with citizens of other countries . The form is used for background checks of current , former and prospective federal employees .\n\u201c This is crown jewels material \u2026 a gold mine for a foreign intelligence service , \u201d said Joel Brenner , a former NSA senior counsel .\nThe SF-86 breach could have dire consequences for U.S. intelligence gathering , former officials said , noting that it would make it extremely difficult for anyone inside the database to ever work in a covert capacity . For example , that would include someone employed by the State or Agriculture departments who gathers intelligence for the Defense Intelligence Agency .\n\u201c This is not the end of American human intelligence , but it \u2019 s a significant blow , \u201d Brenner said .\nAs of October , 4.5 million Americans were cleared for access to classified information , including approximately a million contractors .\nAnd because the SF-86s are stored in an indexed database , that database could also be combed for secrets , said Robert Caruso , a former Navy special security officer who has worked in security at the State and Defense departments . For example , Chinese agents could search the database for instances when agents with NSA covers were in the same place at the same time and make reasonable deductions about what they were doing there .\nBrenner and Caruso both said it \u2019 s likely that clearance forms from the Defense Department and its related intelligence agencies , including NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency , could be accessed through OPM . It \u2019 s much less likely that CIA employee clearance information was accessed that way because the CIA has traditionally insisted on managing its own personnel information .\n\u201c CIA refuses to put its people \u2019 s information in with OPM , and of course they \u2019 re right , \u201d Brenner said .

Full stop . \u201d\nInvestigators became aware of this second breach of the OPM \u2019 s systems as they pursued a previously disclosed breach into an unencrypted system holding personnel files of as many as 4.2 million current and past federal employees . That information included Social Security numbers , as well as names , addresses , pay grades , personnel actions and pension , insurance and health plan details .\nThe administration official said the relevant federal agencies received notification of the latest hack on Monday . \u201c We expect OPM will conduct additional notifications as necessary , \u201d the official said in a statement .\nAdministration officials have said privately that signs point to the first hack having originated in China , and security experts have said it appeared to be part of a Chinese effort to build dossiers on federal employees who might be approached later for espionage purposes .\nThe SF-86 \u201c gives you any kind of information that might be a threat to [ the employees \u2019 ] security clearance , \u201d said Jeff Neal , a former Department of Homeland Security official and a senior vice president at ICF International . \u201c It \u2019 s really a personal document . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s likely that the hackers are building a database on federal employees to \u201c make it easier for them to try to pick off people that they want , \u201d he added , saying most Americans who end up spying for foreign governments are motivated by money .
