The antithesis of government-centered Obamacare is what I simply call \u201cPatientcare.\u201d Patients should be at the center of our health care universe, not President Obama and not the government.\n\nNearly two decades ago when I started medical school, I realized that no matter what the politicians do, or what administrators or anyone else say, all that ultimately matters is the care I provide to my patients. Everything else is secondary. At every level of a health care system, a simple question should be asked: What is best for patients? Not what\u2019s best for government or lawyers or even doctors, but patients.\n\nPatient-centered health care \u2014 Patientcare \u2014 looks like this:\n\nTax fairness: Eliminate ill-conceived taxes that have the perverse effect of preventing Americans from acting responsibly and purchasing individual insurance. If your boss pays for your insurance \u2014 with money he would have otherwise paid directly to you \u2014 then he understandably wants a say about your medical treatment, your private behavior and even your weight.

If they don\u2019t treat you right, you can fire them and hire another \u2014 just like you can your auto-insurance company.\n\nMedicare Advantage: Nothing is more cruel than making promises to patients that cannot be kept and, quite simply, Medicare is insolvent and cannot keep its promises. The U.S. government is already the world\u2019s biggest denier of medical claims. Part of the solution: Give patients the freedom to voluntarily enroll in premium-assistance programs like Medicare Advantage, where they own their own policies, rather than being subject to the rationing whims of unaccountable bureaucrats.\n\nHealth savings accounts: HSAs put patients in the driver\u2019s seat.
