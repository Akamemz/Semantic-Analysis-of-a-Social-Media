    "content": "House Democrats , fresh off massive election losses , say the problem is they didn \u2019 t make a bold enough case for tax increases and wealth transfer to the poor . They rectified that Monday with a speech by Rep. Chris Van Hollen proposing tax increases on the wealthy with the money going straight to tax cuts for the poor and middle class .\nThe plan uses tax laws to encourage employee wage increases , reduce tax breaks for Wall Street and slap another fee on financial transactions . The government would dole out $ 1,000 tax credits for most workers and increase a slew of other tax credits for poor and middle-class families .\n\u201c This is a plan to grow the paychecks of all , not just the wealth of a few . This proposal attacks the chronic problem of stagnant middle-class incomes from both directions . It promotes bigger paychecks and lets workers keep more of what they earn , \u201d Mr. Van Hollen , the ranking member on the House Budget Committee , said in a speech announcing the plan at the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank in Washington .\nThe Maryland Democrat said the proposal would restore balance to a tax code that \u201c is now skewed in favor of people who make money off of money and against those who make money off of work . \u201d\nThe plan built upon the liberal populism that dominates the Democratic agenda for confronting a Republican-controlled Congress , such as the push to raise the minimum wage and reducing student loan debt . But it went further by offering workers a direct cash payment .\nThe package of tax measures is all but dead on arrival in Congress . Instead , the document will become the tip of the spear for Democrats taking on the Republican majority and for the party \u2019 s White House run next year .\nThe proposal , which Mr. Van Hollen called an \u201c action plan , \u201d included :\n\u2981 A $ 1,000 \u201c paycheck bonus tax credit \u201d for every worker making less than $ 100,000 a year or a $ 2,000 credit for every couple filing joint returns who earn less than $ 200,000 a year .\n\u2981 A \u201c saver \u2019 s bonus \u201d of $ 250 each year for individuals who put at least $ 500 of their paycheck bonus tax credits or earned income tax credits into tax-preferred savings accounts .\n\u2981 The CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act that bars big corporations from claiming tax deductions for CEO and other corporate compensation over $ 1 million unless their workers are getting paycheck increases that reflect increases in worker productivity and the cost of living .\n\u2981 Updating the child and dependent care tax credit by raising the amount of eligible expenses , indexing the caps for inflation and making the credit refundable .\n\u2981 A \u201c second-earner tax deduction \u201d that would increase the take-home pay of two-earner families with 20 percent tax deductions for second earners with dependents on up to $ 60,000 of their income .\n\u201c We can pay for these new tax benefits for working Americans by changing the ways our current tax code is rigged in favor of those who make money off of money , and against those who make money from work , \u201d Mr. Van Hollen said .\nHe said the cost would be covered with two measures , curbing tax breaks for the financial services industry and imposing a small fee on Wall Street transactions .\nThe proposal was cheered from the left , including AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who credited Mr. Van Hollen with bringing \u201c bold ideas to the forefront . \u201d\n\u201c Working people want not only to hear what leaders think about raising wages and income inequality , but what they \u2019 ll do about it . Rep. Van Hollen is doing exactly that , \u201d he said .\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price , Georgia Republican , said that repairing the tax code shouldn \u2019 t be about redistributing wealth .\n\u201c We welcome our Democrat colleagues to the conversation about how we can fix our broken tax code and improve the financial security of American families .
