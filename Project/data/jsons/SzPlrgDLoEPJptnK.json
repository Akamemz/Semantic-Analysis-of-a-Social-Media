Added to the current total national debt of more than $ 18.15 trillion , the red ink will likely be crowding the $ 20 trillion mark right around the time Mr. Obama leaves the White House .\nWhen Mr. Obama took over in January 2009 , the total national debt stood at $ 10.6 trillion . That means the debt will have very nearly doubled during his eight years in office , and there is much more debt ahead with the abandonment of \u201c sequestration \u201d spending caps enacted in 2011 .\n\u201c Congress and the president have just agreed to undo one of the only successful fiscal restraint mechanisms in a generation , \u201d said Pete Sepp , president of the National Taxpayers Union . \u201c The progress on reducing spending and the deficit has just become much more problematic . \u201d\nSome budget analysts scoff at the claim made by the administration and by House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , that the budget agreement \u2019 s $ 112 billion in spending increases is fully funded by cuts elsewhere . Mr. Boehner left Congress last week .\n\u201c The Boehner-Obama spending agreement would allow for unlimited borrowing by the Treasury until March 2017 , \u201d said Paul Winfree , director of economic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation . \u201c This deal piles on billions of dollars to the national debt by increasing spending over the next three years and then not paying for it for a decade \u2014 with half of the offsets not occurring until 2025 . \u201d\nThe bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that only about half of the increased spending in the budget deal is paid for . Rather than a spending increase of $ 80 billion over two years , the nonprofit group said , the actual spending hike is $ 154 billion when interest costs and budget gimmicks are factored into the equation .\n\u201c Of this $ 154 billion , about $ 78 billion is paid for honestly \u201d through Medicare reforms , reductions in farm subsidies , asset sales and other measures , the group said . \u201c The remaining $ 56 billion of the legislation \u2014 mostly the war spending increase and interest costs \u2014 is not paid for at all . \u201d\nOf course , Congress bears equal responsibility for the high level of debt . A prime reason that Mr. Boehner left office was conservatives \u2019 displeasure with his accommodation of the president \u2019 s budget requests , aside from three years of \u201c sequestration \u201d spending caps that helped limit annual deficits .\n\u201c We will be raising the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion , \u201d said Sen. Rand Paul , a Kentucky Republican who tried to filibuster the budget deal before the Senate approved it in the wee hours of Friday . \u201c We will be giving President Obama a free pass to borrow as much money as he can borrow in the last year of his office . No limit , no dollar limit . Here you go , President Obama . Spend what you want . \u201d\nThe president said Friday that the agreement \u201c is paid for in a responsible , balanced way . \u201d\n\u201c This agreement will strengthen the middle class by investing in education , job training , and basic research , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c It will keep us safe by investing in our national security . It protects our seniors by avoiding harmful cuts to Medicare and Social Security . It locks in two years of funding and should help break the cycle of shutdowns and manufactured crises that have harmed our economy . \u201d\nWhen Mr. Obama talks about fiscal matters , he usually takes credit for cutting the deficit by two-thirds . He also is correct that annual budget deficits have fallen from $ 1.4 trillion in fiscal 2009 , in the depths of the recession , to $ 439 billion in fiscal 2015 .\nBut the president rarely , if ever , mentions the accumulation of those annual deficits and what the rising national debt means for the country , for the presidents who will follow him and for the nation \u2019 s ability to pay for its priorities .\n\u201c Debt service will continue to consume a larger portion of the federal budget , and we \u2019 ll be looking at gross interest payments on the national debt of close to $ 1 trillion [ annually ] by the time another decade passes , \u201d Mr. Sepp said .\nAnnual net interest payments on the national debt are projected to rise from around $ 220 billion currently to $ 755 billion in 10 years .
