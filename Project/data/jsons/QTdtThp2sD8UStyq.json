But as of early July , every single one of them has a remarkable new level of protection : The Bangladeshi Supreme Court has given all rivers in the country legal rights .\nNow , people who damage a river can get taken to court by the government-appointed National River Conservation Commission . They \u2019 ll be tried as if they \u2019 d harmed a living entity , because each river now has the right to life . That means the river \u2019 s government-designated human representatives can sue on its behalf when it \u2019 s being endangered .\nBangladesh isn \u2019 t the first place to pass such a law . In the US , Ohio voters in February granted Lake Erie the legal right to \u201c exist , flourish , and naturally evolve , \u201d and recent years have also seen national and state laws granting rights to rivers and forests from New Zealand to India to Colombia .\nIt \u2019 s all part of the nascent \u201c rights of nature \u201d movement , which argues that instead of viewing nature as property to be owned , we should recognize that it has its own inalienable rights similar to the ones we enjoy . Activists in the movement want us to give the environment a more central place in humanity \u2019 s expanding moral circle \u2014 the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of moral consideration .\nBut even among the countries that have embraced the rights of nature , Bangladesh now stands out as having done something unprecedented . \u201c What \u2019 s unique about Bangladesh is that they declared all rivers to have this status , \u201d said Ben Price , the national director for the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund ( CELDF ) , a nonprofit public interest law firm that helps people facing threats to their local environment . By contrast , other countries have granted rights only to individual bodies of water .\n\u201c In Bangladesh , the river is considered as our mother , \u201d Mohammad Abdul Matin , general secretary of the Dhaka-based environmental group Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon , told NPR . \u201c The river is now considered by law , by code , a living entity , so you \u2019 ll have to face the consequence by law if you do anything that kills the river . \u201d\nThe country already had fines in place to discourage people from harming the waterways , but those penalties weren \u2019 t working well enough to prevent pollution , illegal dredging , and the encroachment of human settlements . The Supreme Court hopes its landmark ruling will change that . Noting that \u201c water is likely to be the most pressing environmental concern of the next century , \u201d it called for rivers to be protected \u201c at all costs . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s music to the ears of environmentalists , but others argue that granting rights to rivers does come with real costs , and that they \u2019 re too high . With more communities getting interested in enshrining the rights of nature in law \u2014 Price said that activists in Europe , Asia , and Australia have reached out to CELDF for help \u2014 now is a good time to explore the difficulties that are likely to arise as this movement spreads .\nEven as the rights of nature movement has inspired new legislation around the world , it \u2019 s also made clear how ill-equipped governments are to enforce it .\nFor one thing , once a river gets rights , what happens to all the people who live off it ? In Bangladesh , millions \u2014 fishers , farmers , and their families \u2014 live in informal settlements or slums alongside the rivers and depend on the waters for their livelihoods . Now some are being evicted .\n\u201c The government must take stock of poor communities who need resettlement or protection from industries and real estate developers , \u201d said Matin . \u201c If enacted well , the verdict will be helpful in returning the rivers to the people who have historically depended on them . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s also important to note that in some countries where these laws have been enacted , including Bangladesh , nature may now enjoy more rights than some humans in those societies do .\nBangladesh is currently hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been driven out of neighboring Myanmar ; these refugees , many of them women and children , lack legal status in Bangladesh and are restricted from attending Bangladeshi schools or working . The Bangladeshi government is also trying to find ways to get rid of the refugee population \u2014 through forced repatriation to Myanmar or sending refugees to a remote island accessible only by boat . Local officials have sought to justify this by saying the refugees are destroying the local environment .\nA second problem is jurisdictional . Rivers don \u2019 t obey borders \u2014 they often traverse more than one country . If a certain country has granted rights to a river but a neighboring country hasn \u2019 t , that makes it difficult to legally protect the waterway from environmental harm . Bangladeshi environmental activists are already talking about how they won \u2019 t be able to compel India to comply with the new law on rivers .\nIndia itself dealt with this conundrum after the high court in Uttarakhand state granted personhood status to the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in 2017 , appointing the state government as the rivers \u2019 legal guardian . The state government soon challenged this law in India \u2019 s Supreme Court on the grounds that it was impractical because the river stretched far beyond Uttarakhand . The court agreed and stripped the rivers of their short-lived legal rights .\nA third , related problem is that rights of nature laws tend to get tied up in court \u2014 and not everybody has the kind of money required to file a lawsuit . The risk , then , is that whoever has the funding may get to impose their will .\nWe \u2019 ve already seen an example of this in Ecuador , where an NGO called the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature sued a construction company that wanted to build a road over a river . The NGO won in court , but the company didn \u2019 t obey the ruling \u2014 and the NGO reportedly didn \u2019 t have enough money to launch a second court case against the company . So the ruling wasn \u2019 t properly enforced .\nIn Ohio , the Lake Erie Bill of Rights \u2014 the groundbreaking legislation that allows citizens to sue on behalf of the lake when it \u2019 s being polluted \u2014 is caught up in legal wrangling right now . The day after Toledo residents passed the bill in a special election in February , a corporate firm representing agribusiness interests filed a federal lawsuit against the city .\n\u201c We expect this kind of pushback because there are competing interests : The community needs healthy drinking water , while the business community has an interest in making money , \u201d Price told me . The lake is currently experiencing severe algae blooms , and the city of Toledo just filed a new motion trying to get the lawsuit against the bill of rights dismissed .\nIn 1972 , the case of Sierra Club v. Morton came before the US Supreme Court , leading to a deliberation over whether nature should have its own rights . The Court decided the answer was no , but Justice William O. Douglas dissented . \u201c Contemporary public concern for protecting nature \u2019 s ecological equilibrium , \u201d he wrote , \u201c should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation . \u201d\nThat same year , law professor Christopher Stone made a splash with an article titled \u201c Should trees have standing ? \u201d It catalyzed other academics to write a slew of articles and books considering whether natural environments ought to have rights enshrined in law .\nIn 2006 , that question left the ether of academia and came to bear directly on toxic sewage sludge , which had been dumped in Tamaqua , Pennsylvania . Residents fought for \u2014 and won \u2014 the first rights of nature law in the world . Two years later , Ecuador became the first country to enshrine the rights of nature in its constitution , thanks in large part to the work of indigenous activists .\nSince then , the victories have come fast and furious . In 2014 , New Zealand recognized the legal rights of the Te Urewera forest . In 2017 , it also declared the Te Awa Tupua river to have legal personhood . That same year , Colombia granted rights to the Atrato River and India recognized the Ganges and Yamuna rivers as legal persons .\nIn 2018 , the Amazon rainforest got rights , and for the first time , so did a specific plant species : the wild rice known as manoomin , one of the Anishinaabe people \u2019 s staple crops .
