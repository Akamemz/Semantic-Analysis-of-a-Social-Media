    "content": "The benefits for individual taxpayers will be mixed and depend largely on where they fall on the income scale , where they live and the types of tax breaks they tend to claim .\nThose making up to $ 24,000 will pay no income tax . For married taxpayers filing jointly , earnings up to $ 90,000 would be taxed in the 12 percent bracket ; earnings up to $ 260,000 would fall in the 25 percent bracket ; and earnings up to $ 1 million would be taxed at the 35 percent rate . For unmarried individuals and those filing separately , the bracket thresholds would be half of these amounts , other than the 35 percent bracket , which would be $ 200,000 for unmarried individuals .\nThe proposal roughly doubles the standard deduction for middle-class families , expanding it to $ 24,000 for married couples , from $ 12,700 , and setting it at $ 12,000 for individuals , from $ 6,530 today . Republicans also plan to expand the child tax credit to $ 1,600 from $ 1,000 and add a $ 300 credit for each parent and nonchild dependent , such as older family members , though that credit would expire after five years .\nBut it also tightens rules for claiming the child tax credit , a change that would hit immigrant parents whose children were born in the United States . Filers would need to provide a \u201c work-eligible Social Security number \u201d rather than just a taxpayer identification number in order to claim the credit . The left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities said the bill would roll back eligibility for about three million children in working families , including about 80 percent of whom were born in the United States .\nThe bill includes a host of other changes that will affect taxpayers in different ways . For instance , it repeals certain tax credits , including a 15 percent credit for individuals aged 65 or over or who are retired on disability . Right now , those individuals can claim up to $ 7,500 for a joint return , $ 5,000 for a single individual , or $ 3,750 for a married individual filing a joint return .\nThe House bill would entirely repeal that tax credit . It would also repeal the adoption tax credit , no longer allow deductions for tax preparation and repeal credits for alimony payments . And deductions for moving expenses would no longer be allowed .\nOne of the biggest flash points is a proposed change to the popular mortgage interest deduction . Under the Republican plan , existing homeowners can keep the deduction , but future purchases will be capped at $ 500,000 , down from the current $ 1 million limit .",
