    "content": "President Donald Trump 's latest tariff hike on Chinese goods took effect Friday and Beijing said it would retaliate , escalating a battle over China 's technology ambitions and other trade tensions .\nThe Trump administration raised duties on $ 200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 % from 10 % . China 's Commerce Ministry said it would impose `` necessary countermeasures '' but gave no details .\nThe increase went ahead even after American and Chinese negotiators began more talks in Washington aimed at ending a dispute that has disrupted billions of dollars in trade and shaken global financial markets .\n`` The risk of a complete breakdown in trade talks has certainly increased , '' said Michael Taylor of Moody 's Investors Service in a report .\nAmerican officials accuse Beijing of backtracking on commitments made in earlier rounds of negotiations .\nThe talks were due to resume Friday after wrapping up Thursday evening with no word on progress .\n`` China deeply regrets that it will have to take necessary countermeasures , '' said a Commerce Ministry statement .\nShares in Asia were mixed Friday amid renewed investor jitters that global growth might suffer in the battle between the two biggest economies and international traders .\nBusiness groups appealed for a settlement that will resolve chronic complaints about market barriers , subsidies and a regulatory system they say is rigged against foreign companies .\nCompanies disagree with tariff hikes but `` are supportive of the idea in the short term if it helps us get to a strong , enforceable , long-term agreement that addresses structural issues , '' said Greg Gilligan , the deputy chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China .\nThe latest increase extends 25 % duties to a total of $ 250 billion of Chinese imports . Trump said Sunday he might expand penalties to all Chinese goods shipped to the United States .\nBeijing retaliated for previous tariff hikes by raising duties on $ 110 billion of American imports . But regulators are running out of U.S. goods for penalties due to the lopsided trade balance .\nChinese officials have targeted operations of American companies in China by slowing customs clearance for them and stepping up regulatory scrutiny that can hamper operations .\nThe latest U.S. increase might hit American consumers harder , said Jake Parker , vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council , an industry group . He said the earlier 10 percent increase was absorbed by companies and offset by a weakening of the Chinese currency 's exchange rate .\nA 25 percent hike `` needs to be passed on to the consumer , '' said Parker . `` It is just too big to dilute with those other factors .
