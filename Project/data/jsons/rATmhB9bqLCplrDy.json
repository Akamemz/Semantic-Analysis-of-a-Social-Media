Because she criticizes socialism .\nAfter Alvarez joined me in my American studio to make a video we titled `` Socialism Fails Every Time , '' she flew to Mexico City to make a speech .\nA few days later she wrote me that `` some leftist 'students ' posted on a fanpage called 'Marxist and Leninist Memes ' : 'BOYCOTT Gloria Alvarez in our University !

' ''\nSo Alvarez posted ( in Spanish ) on her own Facebook page : `` My dear Mexican socialists intolerants : Thank you ! for trying to boycott my event\u2026 showing that panic that you have for the debate of ideas .

''\nShe ended her riff with a wise defense of free speech : `` Where words are exchanged , bullets are no longer exchanged . ''\n`` You recently posted something that violates Facebook policies , '' wrote Facebook .\nWhat violated Facebook policies ?
