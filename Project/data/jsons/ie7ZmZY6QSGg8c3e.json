    "content": "Donald Trump is adamant that he raised more than $ 5 million for military veterans this campaign season and that it is all going to veterans charities . After reports raised questions about whether that 's true , Trump scheduled a press conference Tuesday to give more details about the donations ' whereabouts .\nAt his press conference , Trump explained the lack of clarity surfaced in a recent Washington Post report by stating he `` wanted to keep it private '' : `` I do n't think it 's anybody 's business if I wan na send money to the vets , '' before ultimately unveiling the list of recipients .\nHere are the veterans ' groups that have received money from the Trump campaign , totaling $ 5.6 million . pic.twitter.com/7AWcZfAkP0 \u2014 Brad Mielke ( @ TheBradMielke ) May 31 , 2016\nAccording to reporting from the Associated Press , many of these donations were dated the same day as the Washington Post 's article . Trump associated the timing with the vetting process , `` reviewing statistics , reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money , '' he said Tuesday .\nBut what his reaction to scrutiny of his alleged veterans donations really reveals about Trump is how he handles criticism from the press \u2014 viewing fact-checking from reporters as personal attacks rather than a nettlesome but necessary role in democracy .\nLast week , the presumptive Republican nominee responded to the Post 's report which found his January charity event \u2013 which he claimed raised more than $ 6 million in donations for veterans charities \u2013 had come up short .\nMuch of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed , with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 24 , 2016\nIt 's not the first time reports have raised questions about the donations . In March , Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks shot down media inquiries in an interview with CNN that similarly wondered about these alleged donations .\n`` If the media spent half as much time highlighting the work of these groups and how our veterans have been so mistreated , rather than trying to disparage Mr. Trump 's generosity for a totally unsolicited gesture for which he had no obligation , we would all be better for it , '' Hicks told CNN .\nAt the event , which Trump held as counterprograming to the Republican presidential debate he boycotted in January , the candidate said he `` broke $ 6 million '' in donations , $ 1 million of which he donated himself .\nBut as of March , Hicks said they were still collecting donations . Now Trump 's campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , says some of the event 's biggest donors have backed down on their promises . The fundraiser actually brought in $ 4.5 million , or 75 percent of what was initially said , the Washington Post 's David Fahrenthold reported . He later remarked on Twitter that even the adjusted numbers are still a hefty and admirable sum for a worthy cause :\nLewandowski also said he did not know whether a $ 1 million pledge from Trump himself was counted as part of the $ 4.5 million total . He said Trump has given that amount , but he declined to identify any recipients .\nAt the time of the report , the campaign said the amount was not $ 4.5 million , Trump tweeted it is somewhere between $ 5 million and $ 6 millions , and it was unclear where Trump 's own pledge of $ 1 million ended up .\nBut regardless of the numbers , something has become increasingly clear : Trump feels this is n't about the money . He 's making it about him doing a good deed .\n`` The press should be ashamed at themselves , and on behalf of the vets the press should be ashamed of themselves , '' Trump said Tuesday , even calling a reporter at his press conference a `` sleaze . ''\n`` Instead of being like , \u2018 Thank you very much , Mr. Trump , ' or \u2018 Trump did a good job , ' everyone said : \u2018 Who got it ? Who got it ? Who got it ? ' '' Trump said . `` And you make me look very bad . I have never received such bad publicity for doing a good job . ''\nThe Washington Post report was yet another `` dishonest '' ploy from the mainstream media , trying to spin his good deed into scandal , he tweeted when the report surfaced .\nAmazingly , with all of the money I have raised for the vets , I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 24 , 2016\nIn many ways , Trump 's idea to host a fundraising event honoring veterans began as a reaction to the `` disgusting media . '' In January , Trump decided to boycott the last GOP presidential debate before the Iowa caucuses because of Fox News host and debate moderator Megyn Kelly .\nIt was an early chapter in their months-long feud \u2014 she represented the `` biased '' media ; he felt she had personally targeted him in the first debate and intended to tank Fox News 's ratings by hosting a charitable even in Iowa at the same time as the debate . ( Trump and Kelly have , of course , now officially made up . )\nTrump 's fundraiser was organized on a whim and featured the things that represent Trump the most : Middle America , an unyielding love for America , and Trump supporters .\nFor Trump , the Washington Post 's report was an attempt to turn a good deed sour .\nBut Fahrenthold maintains that was n't the intention , launching a 16-tweet response to Trump 's comment . He has some questions :\n1/ This is a good time for a recap of what we know about @ realdonaldtrump 's Jan. 28 fundraiser in Iowa ... https : //t.co/eL01y8zgYf \u2014 David Fahrenthold ( @ Fahrenthold ) May 24 , 2016\n2/ First and foremost , it did raise at least $ 3.1M for veterans .
