    "content": "A long-awaited watchdog report provided a sweeping and detailed rebuke of actions taken by former FBI Director James Comey to publicize details about the politically charged investigation into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s use of a private email server , but found no evidence that the probe was affected by bias or other political considerations .\nThe 500-page report also faulted Obama-era Justice Department leaders for not taking a firmer hand with Mr. Comey , and slammed multiple FBI employees involved in the investigation for sending politically charged text messages , saying the texts \u201c cast a cloud \u201d over the investigation and its credibility .\nWhile providing the most definitive account of the probe , the report , released Thursday , didn \u2019 t settle long-simmering dissatisfaction among both Democrats and Republicans over the bureau \u2019 s handling of the investigation .\nThe report \u2019 s sharpest criticism was leveled at Mr. Comey , who was fired by President Donald Trump last May .\nThe inspector general \u2019 s office said it found \u201c unpersuasive \u201d Mr. Comey \u2019 s argument for why he ignored Justice Department policy on the Clinton email probe while hewing to it on the separate Russia and Clinton Foundation investigations .\nBut the report said investigative and prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton investigation were \u201c not unreasonable \u201d and could be justified on policy and legal grounds .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s allies have blamed Mr. Comey \u2019 s handling of the probe for putting Mr. Trump over the top in the November 2016 presidential election . At the same time , Mr. Trump and some Republicans maintain that actions by Mr. Comey and FBI agents during the Clinton probe showed bias against the president , which has also infected the special counsel \u2019 s probe into Russian interference in the election .\nThe report gave an unusually detailed accounting of one of the FBI \u2019 s highest profile investigations , its probe into whether Mrs. Clinton intended to transmit classified information on an unclassified , private email server while Secretary of State .\nThe sprawling inquiry examined the genesis of the probe , which was code-named Midyear Exam , investigative measures taken by prosecutors and FBI agents and Mr. Comey \u2019 s controversial public comments on the matter .\nThe inspector general \u2019 s office said it found the Justice Department \u2019 s conclusion not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton or her senior aides\u2014based on a lack of evidence that her team intended to send classified information on unclassified systems\u2014 \u201c consistent with \u201d how the department had approached previous similar cases .\nThe report determined that Mr. Comey deviated from long-established policies in speaking publicly about the investigation at a news conference in July 2016 and sending a letter to Congress in the days before the election that disclosed the bureau had reopened the probe .\nIn his July 5 news conference , which was criticized at the time by former top Justice Department officials in both parties , Mr. Comey said the FBI was recommending no charges be filed against Mrs. Clinton . He also chastised the Democratic presidential candidate and her aides for being \u201c extremely careless \u201d in how they handled classified information .\n\u201c We found that it was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so , and we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established Department policies , \u201d the report said .\nMr. Comey didn \u2019 t tell Justice Department leaders he would be speaking about the case until just before he publicly announced his conclusions on national television . Mr. Comey \u2019 s secrecy was intended to make it \u201c impractical for Department leadership to prevent him \u201d from delivering his public assessment , the inspector general said .\nMr. Comey said he was still weighing whether to speak publicly when then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on June 27 held an impromptu meeting with former President Bill Clinton on her Justice Department jet on an Arizona tarmac .\nThe inspector general found Ms. Lynch \u2019 s failure to immediately recognize the problem created by the meeting was \u201c an error in judgment \u201d and also determined that her public responses to the controversy only created confusion . Mr. Comey said the meeting \u201c tipped \u201d the scales for him and he went forward with his press briefing on July 5 , the report said .\nWhen Mr. Comey and Ms. Lynch spoke that morning , the attorney general didn \u2019 t assert her authority as Mr. Comey \u2019 s boss , the inspector general concluded . \u201c We believe she should have instructed Comey to tell her what he intended to say beforehand , and should have discussed it with Comey , \u201d the report says .\n\u201c We conclude that Comey \u2019 s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department practice and protocol , \u201d especially in criticizing \u201c uncharged conduct \u201d by Mrs. Clinton , the watchdog found . \u201c We also found that Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General . \u201d\nMs. Lynch said the report \u201c affirms that my actions had no political motivation or bias and complied with DOJ policies . \u201d\nMr. Comey was also criticized for engaging in \u201c ad hoc \u201d decision making when sending a letter to Congress just days before the 2016 election saying that the FBI had reopened the matter , after discovering Clinton-related emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , a disgraced former congressman who was married to a Clinton aide .\nMr. Comey defended his actions to the inspector general by saying he had encountered unusual circumstances and did what he thought was best for the bureau and Justice Department . On Twitter , he wrote : \u201c The conclusions are reasonable , even though I disagree with some . People of good faith can see an unprecedented situation differently . I pray no Director faces it again . \u201d\nIn the course of its 18-month investigation , Inspector General Michael Horowitz \u2019 s staff also unearthed thousands of controversial text messages exchanged between Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel that disparaged Mr. Trump . The inspector general said his office was \u201c deeply troubled \u201d by the messages , which \u201c potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations . \u201d\n\u201c Departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and Department norms , the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice , \u201d the report concluded .\nOf special focus in the report were FBI Agent Peter Strzok and now-former FBI lawyer Lisa Page , who exchanged thousands of text messages over the course of 2015 through 2017 . Mr. Strzok , who was romantically involved with Ms . Page , had led the Clinton probe and later was the top agent on Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s team investigating Russia \u2019 s interference in the 2016 election .\nThe texts \u201c sowed doubt \u201d about the FBI \u2019 s work , the report said , and \u201c created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. \u201d Still , the inspector general discovered no evidence that \u201c improper considerations , including political bias , directly affected the specific investigative decisions \u201d in the case .\nThe watchdog also examined how agents handled the discovery of Clinton-related emails on the laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner , and faulted the FBI for a monthlong delay between the discovery of the emails and investigative action by agents .\nThe inspector general said the texts raised questions about whether Mr. Strzok permitted political bias to cloud his judgment during one critical juncture in the investigation .\nIn September , an FBI agent working an unrelated case came across thousands of Clinton-related emails on Mr. Weiner \u2019 s laptop . Mr. Strzok and FBI officials learned about the emails in late September 2016 but took no official action for nearly a month , the inspector general concluded . The inspector general said it found no evidence that the laptop was \u201c deliberately placed on the back-burner . \u201d\nIn one previously unreported text , Mr. Strzok sent a text in August 2016 in response to a message from Ms . Page , who was worried that Mr. Trump might win the election . In his reply , Mr. Strzok wrote : \u201c No . No he \u2019 s not . We \u2019 ll stop it . \u201d\nAccording to the report , Mr. Strzok stated that he believed his message was intended to reassure Ms . Page , and not suggest that he would somehow stop Mr. Trump .\nA lawyer for Mr. Strzok , Aitan Goelman , said in a statement that the inspector general correctly concluded \u201c that there is no evidence that the political views of Special Agent Strzok and others in the FBI impacted the handling of the Clinton email investigation . \u201d\nHowever , he said the report was flawed \u201c in its bizarre conclusion \u201d that the inspector general could n't rule out that bias may have affected his handling of the emails on the Weiner laptop . He noted that \u201c Special Agent Strzok openly admitted that he believed that the Russia investigation was far more important to American national security than the Clinton email investigation , this conclusion is evidence of Special Agent Strzok \u2019 s lucidity , not his bias . \u201d\nAside from Mr. Strzok and Ms . Page , the report also found that three other FBI employees , all on the Clinton investigation , swapped politically charged messages that were hostile toward Mr. Trump and supportive of Mrs. Clinton .\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the report \u201c reaffirmed the president \u2019 s suspicions about Comey \u2019 s conduct and about the political bias of some members of the FBI . \u201d\nDemocrats complained that Mr. Comey used a different standard in handling major cases involving the 2016 candidates . \u201c The FBI \u2019 s actions helped Donald Trump become president , \u201d Reps. Elijah Cummings ( D. , Md . ) and Jerrold Nadler ( D. , N.Y. ) said in a statement . \u201c Comey had a double-standard : He spoke publicly about the Clinton investigation while keeping secret from the American people the investigation of Donald Trump and Russia . \u201d\nIn the report , the inspector general also identified instances in which Mr. Comey used a personal Gmail email account to work on nonclassified documents , including drafts of all-staff messages he was working on , as well as a proposed opening statement for March 2017 testimony to the House Intelligence Committee .\nMr. Comey told the inspector general that he didn \u2019 t have an unclassified FBI connection at home that worked , and that \u201c for unclassified work , I would use my personal laptop for word processing and then send it into the FBI. \u201d Because the messages were forwarded to work accounts and weren \u2019 t classified , Mr. Comey said he thought his practice complied with FBI regulations but wasn \u2019 t sure , according to the report .\nThe report found that Mr. Comey \u2019 s use of the personal account was inconsistent with Justice Department policy , which says personal email accounts should be used for work only in \u201c exigent circumstances . \u201d\nThe report also referred to Mr. Comey \u2019 s deputy , Andrew McCabe , a longtime agent who was fired by the Justice Department in March , a day shy of retiring with full benefits over allegations he misled investigators with the FBI and Inspector General over his role in an article in The Wall Street Journal .\nThe report didn \u2019 t examine those interactions , but it agreed with FBI ethics officials that Mr. McCabe hadn \u2019 t been required to recuse himself from overseeing the Clinton probe because his wife had run as a Democrat for a Virginia statehouse seat and had accepted campaign donations from a close Clinton ally \u2019 s political-action committee . \u201c McCabe did what he was supposed to do , \u201d the report said .",
