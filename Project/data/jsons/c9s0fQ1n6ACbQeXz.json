    "content": "America \u2019 s law enforcement officers were suffering a suicide epidemic before anti-police and racial justice protests engulfed the country . Now police advocates worry it will get worse .\nLast year , a record 228 current or former police officers died by suicide , according to Blue H.E.L.P. , a nonprofit that tracks police suicides . That total is higher than all other line-of-duty deaths last year , the organization said .\nThe number of suicides slowed somewhat in the first half of 2020 with only 70 deaths , down from 89 during the same period in 2019 , though mental health experts caution that those numbers are vastly underreported because of the stigma associated with suicide .\nThat was before police officers across the country came under siege because of the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis .\nPsychologists and police officers say the torrent of criticism is more traumatic than the life-and-death situations officers face on the job . They expect the number of police suicides to start climbing again .\n\u201c I hope I \u2019 m wrong , but I think the number of police suicides will start to creep back up , \u201d said Sherri Martin , a former police officer and national director of the Fraternal Order of Police \u2019 s national officer wellness committee .\n\u201c Long term , the number of anti-police sentiments could take more of a toll than a singular incident you can compartmentalize , \u201d she said . \u201c This is a widespread big wave of things coming at officers at once rather than a small whitecap . \u201d\nRioters have hurled bricks and screamed obscenities at officers and burned down a Minneapolis police station during the wave of protests . Residents of one Seattle neighborhood have set up a six-block no-police zone . Activists and politicians have called to defund the police . Congress is hurriedly drafting legislation to combat what is described as racism and brutality in policing .\nPresident Trump plans to sign an executive order on policing to address the nationwide uproar . It is expected to tread lightly on police powers , with measures such as creating a national database to track officers with repeat misconduct charges .\n\u201c The overall goal is we want law and order , and we want it done fairly , justly , we want it done safely , \u201d the president said Monday . \u201c But we want law and order . It \u2019 s about law and order . But it \u2019 s about justice also , and it \u2019 s about safety . \u201d\nStill , the overriding tone on the streets of U.S. cities and on Capitol Hill has been punitive toward police .\nSen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , said police clashes with protesters and \u201c overly aggressive tactics have only articulated further the need for bold and wide-reaching reform of police practices . \u201d\n\u201c Being killed by police is now the sixth leading cause of death for young black men in America , \u201d he said .\nIt is expected to take time before the toll on police officers can be fully calculated .\nDepression usually strikes within 12 to 18 months of a traumatic incident , said Thomas Coghlan , a retired NYPD police detective who served for 21 years on the force before becoming a clinical psychologist specializing in first responders .\nPolice officers did not experience post-traumatic stress disorder in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , but they did about a year later , he said .\nThis time , it could be worse for officers as the anti-police animosity takes its toll . Ms. Martin said .\nDuring the two weeks following Mr. Floyd \u2019 s death , 749 officers nationwide were injured while responding to protests and disturbances , according to Justice Department statistics . That figure includes the roughly 150 officers hurt during the protests in the District of Columbia , where 22 officers suffered concussions and other head injuries requiring hospitalization .\n\u201c Katrina and 9/11 were not direct attacks on law enforcement , \u201d she said . \u201c The riots and anti-police sentiment is different , but it is going to have the same effect . I \u2019 ve never seen [ the animosity ] at a level like this . It is not only the intensity of the sentiment but that it is so widespread . \u201d\nAs the defund-the-police movement gains momentum , mayors of several large cities , including New York , Philadelphia and Los Angeles , have moved to slash their department \u2019 s budget . Analysts expect the cuts to put mental health services within those police departments on the chopping block .\n\u201c The defunding is not going to be operational defunding , \u201d Mr. Coghlan said . \u201c It is going to hit social and mental health services . It is the exact opposite of what needs to be done . \u201d\nOne of the first signs of potential suicide is burnout , Mr. Coghlan said .
