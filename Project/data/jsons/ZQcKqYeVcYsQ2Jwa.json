    "content": "Let \u2019 s play a little compare and contrast , shall we ? I \u2019 m going to share two quotes from two different speakers . Your mission in this game , should you choose to accept it , will be to determine each quote \u2019 s original speaker . With all that being said , let \u2019 s begin .\nHere \u2019 s the first quote . Let \u2019 s call it Quote 1 ( or Q1 , for short ) :\n[ I ] n this situation , the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people 's enemies by terror . If the spring of popular government in time of peace is virtue , the springs of popular government in revolution are at once virtue and terror : virtue , without which terror is fatal ; terror , without which virtue is powerless . Terror is nothing other than justice , prompt , severe , inflexible ; it is therefore an emanation of virtue ; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country 's most urgent needs .\nGot it ? Okay , now here \u2019 s the second quote . Let \u2019 s call it Quote 2 ( or Q2 , for short ) :\nYou built a factory out there ? Good for you . But I want to be clear : you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for ; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate ; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for . You did n't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory , and hire someone to protect against this , because of the work the rest of us did . Now look , you built a factory and it turned into something terrific , or a great idea ? God bless . Keep a big hunk of it . But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along .\nNow that you \u2019 ve familiarized yourself with both Q1 and Q2 , let \u2019 s introduce the two speakers . One is Elizabeth Warren , a Democratic member of the U.S. Senate from the state of Massachusetts and the intellectual founder of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . The other is Maximilien Robespierre , the French revolutionary , leading member of the Jacobin Club , and most-famous member of Committee of Public Safety , the small executive body that governed the First French Republic during the Reign of Terror . Can you guess which quote came from which speaker ?\nAssuming you \u2019 re not currently suffering from aphasia , the answer is rather obviously yes \u2014 because the two quotes sound nothing alike . And while you \u2019 d think this to be self-evident , it is apparently not . Or at least it \u2019 s not to Matt Bai , the star pundit-reporter and longtime communicator of whatever the conventional wisdom of the political elite happens to be at any given time . Because in his latest piece for Yahoo ! , a rather strained call for Vice President Joe Biden to run for president , Bai refers to Warren as someone \u201c who sounds more like a Jacobin \u201d than a serious candidate for president .\nIn fairness to Bai , it seems pretty unlikely that his comment was intended to be anything more than a withering quip . Calling Warren a Bolshevik or communist would sound too much like something a Tea Partyer might say ; so it \u2019 s much less gauche to go with the less-politically-charged \u201c Jacobin \u201d instead . But Bai \u2019 s wisecrack is still representative of a bigger phenomenon ( and problem ) within the Washington mainstream , which still mostly regards Warren with fear and suspicion , and still wonders if she \u2019 s \u201c serious \u201d enough to appreciate Larry Summers \u2019 warning that you can \u2019 t be influential in D.C. if you \u2019 re known for rocking the boat .\nAs the Democratic caucuses in Congress have shrunk , and as Warren \u2019 s influence has grown , the elite \u2019 s anxiety over her rise has become almost palpable . I \u2019 ve lost track of the number of times one centrist pundit or another has called her the Ted Cruz of the left ( which is never intended as a compliment ) . It was just this week , in fact , that a new group of \u201c centrist \u201d Democrats , \u201c The New Democrat Coalition , \u201d announced its plans to keep control of the party out of Warren \u2019 s hands . It \u2019 s all very predictable ; but if you \u2019 re familiar with Warren \u2019 s views and her record , it simply doesn \u2019 t make sense .\nBy way of illustration , take a look at the new profile of Warren published this week in Politico Magazine , which is hardly a hotbed of doctrinaire liberalism . Written by Glenn Thrush and Manu Raju , the piece bears most of the hallmarks of the Politico style , for better and worse . At no point during its thousands of words do Warren \u2019 s policy views get any more than the most cursory attention , and the only new information it provides is essentially gossip . ( Former President Bill Clinton refused to campaign for Warren during her 2012 Senate bid because she has been mean to his banker buddies , for example . ) But what \u2019 s most interesting about the piece is that even here , in the unofficial flagship magazine of elite Washington , the fundamentally non-radical approach Warren takes to politics is crystal clear .\nIndeed , what we see Warren doing in the piece more than anything else is playing politics by the traditional means . Before her star-making performance as an overseer of the Wall Street bailouts , she spends years quietly but consistently building contacts in Washington and making powerful friends . When the White House decides it won \u2019 t go to bat for her to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau she largely created , she doesn \u2019 t rail against them in the press or demand it appoint a radical in her stead . When Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid offers her a spot on the leadership team , she happily takes it , hoping to prove to anybody watching that she \u2019 s a \u201c team player. \u201d Hell , according to Politico , she \u2019 s even trying to find ways to compromise with Republicans in the Senate !\nGiven all of the above , a reasonable person might ask why Matt Bai \u2019 s Washington finds Warren so threatening nevertheless . I \u2019 m not a mind-reader , of course , but I can offer two theories . The first and most obvious reason is that Washington is , to put it gently , a swamp of corruption where many influential people live comfortably \u2014 thanks to Wall Street . Maybe they \u2019 re lobbyists ; maybe they work in free-market think tanks ; maybe they \u2019 re employed by the defense industry , which benefits greatly from Wall Street \u2019 s largesse . Or maybe they \u2019 re government bureaucrats who find Warren \u2019 s opposition to the `` revolving door '' to be in profound conflict with their future plans .\nMy second theory is less political and more prosaic . Another reason Bai and his ilk find Warren discomfiting may be her glaring lack of false modesty and her disinterest in keeping her head down and paying her dues . Because despite being the capital of what is nominally the greatest liberal democracy on Earth , Washington is in truth a deeply conformist and hierarchical milieu , one where new arrivals are expected to be neither seen nor heard until they \u2019 ve been deemed to have earned their place . And while Warren may want to be seen as a team player , what she cares most about is reining in Wall Street . If she deems it necessary to accomplish her primary goal , she \u2019 s willing to step on some toes and lose a few fair-weather friends .\nTo my eyes , this still leaves an expansive distance between Warren and the 18th century Frenchmen who so vigorously wielded the \u201c National Razor. \u201d But I can \u2019 t entirely blame Bai and company for worrying that the ascension of this law professor from Oklahoma portends an October Revolution yet to come . As defenders of the Ancien R\u00e9gime once warned King Louis XVI , the moment when you have the most to lose is exactly when you must tighten your grip .",
