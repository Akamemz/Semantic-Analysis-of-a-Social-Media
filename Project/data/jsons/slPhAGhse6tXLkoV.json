He said he \u2019 s seen a \u201c genuine desire \u201d from many of them to move past \u201c Washington dysfunction \u201d on the deficit . \u201c Whether we can get it done or not , you know , we \u2019 ll see , \u201d he said .\nThe meetings are intended to break a two-year stalemate between the administration and congressional Republicans over the nation \u2019 s finances that has hindered efforts to spur the economy after the worst recession in seven decades . A so-called grand bargain to curb the long-term deficit has proved elusive , with Democrats resisting cuts to Medicare and Social Security , and Republicans opposing tax increases .\n\u201c The odds are not exceedingly high \u201d for an agreement , said David Plouffe , a former senior Obama adviser who left the White House in January . Still , Plouffe said , discussions about a comprehensive debt deal \u201c have a firm heartbeat again . \u201d\nAmid concern among some Republican senators over reductions in defense spending if the impasse continues , the administration signaled its willingness to negotiate by proposing a budget that includes changes to the health and retirement programs for the elderly in exchange for rolling back tax breaks that primarily benefit the wealthy and corporations .\n\u201c There are just enough \u201d Senate Republicans alarmed by automatic cuts in national security spending to allow the plan to work , said William Hoagland , a former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee . \u201c The strategy from the White House is to isolate the House and build pressure on the House . \u201d\nObama also has met with Senate Democrats and House members of both parties .\nThe administration \u2019 s focus on sounding out Senate Republicans open to a budget deal mirrors a strategy from last December , when it forged a deal with those lawmakers to raise taxes for high-income earners . After it passed the Senate , the Republican-run House cleared the agreement .\nThe White House interprets House Speaker John Boehner \u2019 s actions in December as tacit acceptance of a Senate-first strategy in attempting a deal , said a Democrat familiar with the administration \u2019 s thinking .\nLast week the House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure intended to ensure that U.S. government bondholders will continue to be paid and that Social Security benefits won \u2019 t be interrupted even if a stand-off over raising the nation \u2019 s borrowing limit causes a cash crunch .\nRepresentative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee , said today he \u2019 s \u201c worried \u201d about a replay of the summer of 2011 , when a standoff over raising the debt limit led Standard and Poor \u2019 s to downgrade the U.S. credit rating .\nRepublicans have \u201c come up , at least for now , with the cockamamie idea that you \u2019 re going to pay some of your bills but not all of your bills , \u201d he said at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Washington Summit . \u201c That \u2019 s not a solution . \u201d\nBoehner can \u2019 t corral Tea Party Republicans to support a bipartisan compromise to raise the debt ceiling , Van Hollen said . \u201c I \u2019 m very nervous that , despite what I think are the speaker \u2019 s good intentions to avoid a showdown , he can \u2019 t see his way to putting on the table a decent way out . \u201d\nCongress voted at the end of January to suspend the nation \u2019 s $ 16.4 trillion debt limit until May 19 , temporarily removing the risk of a default . The Treasury Department can ward off a default for several months beyond that by shifting money among government accounts , possibly to as late as September .\nWhile the administration may be courting Senate Republicans , House Republicans are preparing to seize on the need to increase the nation \u2019 s borrowing authority to extract cuts to programs such as Medicare without tax increases .\nThey are considering a strategy to act early , with legislation that would authorize a debt-limit increase on their preferred terms in the hopes it would step up pressure on the White House and Democratic-controlled Senate , aides said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re starting very early and making it clear that unless the president wants another fiscal cliff fiasco , we \u2019 re determined to avoid that , \u201d Representative Kevin Brady , a Texas Republican , said in an interview .\nStill , the refusal by House Republicans to consider higher taxes , even in return for reductions in Medicare and Social Security spending , may set up another fiscal showdown .\nIn 2011 , lawmakers fought for months over raising the nation \u2019 s debt limit . Obama signed the increase into law on Aug. 2 , 2011 , the day the Treasury Department warned that U.S. borrowing authority would expire .\nCredit markets weren \u2019 t rattled by the 2011 standoff , as yields on 10-year Treasury notes declined to 2.61 percent on Aug. 2 from 3.18 percent on July 1 , 2011 , and continued to fall to 1.88 percent at year-end . The benchmark 10-year yield was at 1.67 percent at 11:45 a.m. New York time today , down 0.09 percentage points since Dec. 31 .\nStandard & Poor \u2019 s downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time on Aug. 5 , 2011 , citing the partisan gridlock over the debt-limit standoff . Stock investors got rattled , with the benchmark Standard & Poor \u2019 s 500 Index falling 16.8 percent between July 22 , when talks on a broad deal faltered , and Aug. 8 , the first trading day after the downgrade .\nThis time , the White House and Democratic congressional leaders view Republicans \u2019 potential ultimatum on the debt ceiling as a \u201c false threat , \u201d said Steve Elmendorf , a Democratic lobbyist and former congressional aide with close ties to the Obama administration and party leaders .\nPlouffe , now a commentator for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Television , said House legislation tying an increase in the debt ceiling to cuts in Medicare and Social Security isn \u2019 t going to generate public pressure on the White House .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t think of a worse political position than , \u2018 We would tank the global economy unless you allow us to cut Medicare too deeply , \u2019 \u201d he said .\nThe White House is using a period in which Washington is focused on revising immigration policy to strengthen ties with senators who could form a middle ground on a deficit plan , Elmendorf said . Success on immigration might spill over to the fiscal fight .\n\u201c Problem No . 1 , which is going to take up everybody \u2019 s time and attention until June at least , is to get the immigration bill passed , \u201d he said . \u201c So the focus is going to be on creating the relationships and atmosphere where you can do this fiscal deal . The focus is not going to be on negotiating a deal . \u201d\nThe White House believes settling the partisan fight over budget deficits is Obama \u2019 s best chance of achieving priorities such as more money for infrastructure , medical research and education , and gives Republicans an opportunity for a tax overhaul that lowers rates by reducing breaks , Elmendorf said .\nBoehner \u2019 s spokesman , Michael Steel , said the Ohio Republican is \u201c talking with members , and the American people , about the best way to increase the debt limit consistent with the Boehner rule , \u201d which he said demands spending cuts equal to or greater than the amount of a debt-limit increase . \u201c No decisions will be made anytime soon , \u201d Steel said .\nThe administration \u2019 s effort to sound out Senate Republicans diverges from its strategy in fiscal negotiations in 2011 , when Obama concentrated on talks with Boehner .
