But to say that NBC News or MSNBC don \u2019 t have a political point of view is just ridiculous . We all know it . Well , anyone who isn \u2019 t a snowflake progressive knows this . Mick Mulvaney , the director of the Office of Budget and Management , surely knows this , with him calling out some of the questions during Sunday \u2019 s Meet the Press broadcast , where he plainly hinted at NBC \u2019 s slant on the issue . It was something that guest host Andrea Mitchell was not keen about , saying they \u2019 re not taking a point of view , merely citing nonpartisan groups . The two were discussing the Republican tax reform package , which Democrats say is a giveaway to the rich . On the allegations of sexual misconduct involving Roy Moore , the Republican Alabama Senate candidate , Mitchell asked Mulvaney if he believed the accusers . Mulvaney noted that he was the OMB director , but that he had no reason to doubt the accusers credibility . Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner had the transcription . The Media Research Center clipped the exchange .\nMick Mulvaney : \u201c So I laugh every time I come on networks like this , they accuse us of cutting taxes on the rich . Every time I go on different networks , and you may understand who those are , they accuse us of raising taxes on the rich . So I think it looks \u2014 depends on how you want to look at it. \u201d Andrea Mitchell : \u201c We \u2019 re not taking a political point of view here . We are actually going by nonpartisan groups like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , all the impact on the exploding deficit which will impact future generations. \u201d [ \u2026 ] Mitchell : \u201c Do you believe that the women who \u2019 ve come out against Roy Moore are credible ? \u201d Mulvaney : \u201c I believe they \u2019 re credible .

I don \u2019 t know who to believe . And I do think , as the president said , that voters should decide. \u201d Mitchell : \u201c If they \u2019 re credible . Why wouldn \u2019 t you believe them ? \u201d Mulvaney : \u201c Andrea , I run the Office of Management and Budget in Washington , D.C. You work for NBC News in Washington , D.C. My guess is we \u2019 ve not spent that much time looking at the specifics of these allegations . You \u2019 ve arrived at a certain conclusion because of a certain political persuasion . We \u2019 re simply\u2013 \u201d Mitchell : \u201c Not because of a political persuasion at all . I \u2019 m -- I am simply asking whether you believe that they are credible . They have been out in public . They have spoken on the record . Some were brought ; some stories were brought out by Alabama journalists in the local newspapers down there , not just by the Washington Post . And I have no political axe to grind here other than to ask you whether you believe they are credible . \u201d\nFirst , this is laughable .
