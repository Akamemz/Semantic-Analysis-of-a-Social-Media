    "content": "Collapse A city without cars ? Helsinki tries to persuade Finns to give up their keys .\nFor years , environmentalists and urban planners on both sides of the Atlantic have been fantasizing about few- or no-car city living , in order to make their municipalities easier and safer places to live , while also reducing their carbon footprint .\nThe mayors of a number of cities , such as Paris , Athens , and Mexico City , have committed their governments to banning cars by 2025 . Others , such as Oslo and London , have imposed partial moratoriums and fees on city driving . But such bans are difficult to enforce and politically contentious .\nIn Helsinki , Finland , a city that prides itself on its civic-mindedness , municipal authorities are looking at the challenge of phasing out the car in a different way : as a matter of efficiency and incentivization .\n\u201c It is a fact that on average , a privately owned car is used 4 percent of the time , \u201d says Ville Lehmuskoski , chief executive officer of Helsinki City Transport , the municipal body responsible for the Finnish capital \u2019 s public transport infrastructure . \u201c The other 96 percent \u2013 the 96 percent of the time when it is parked there sitting around \u2013 represents an enormous loss of resources , particularly money and space .\n\u201c If the need for cars in the Helsinki region could be lessened by only 25 percent , \u201d Mr. Lehmuskoski continues , \u201c it would mean 100,000 fewer cars . If the average value of the car is \u20ac10,000 [ $ 11,150 ] , that would mean \u20ac1 billion [ $ 1.1 billion ] could be freed to speed up the economy in a more effective way , or otherwise benefit the society . \u201d\nGetting Greater Helsinki \u2019 s million-odd , peninsula-centered residents to view the privately owned car as an uneconomic investment of the region \u2019 s finite resources , rather than a matter of private convenience , is an offshoot of Finland \u2019 s social democratic history and experience .\n\u201c Helsinki has chosen a different strategy from other European cities , \u201d says Marko Forsblom , chief executive officer of Intelligent Transport Systems , a Finnish transportation think tank . \u201c It has chosen to create such good alternatives to the private car that people voluntarily choose other modes than owning a car . It has chosen to get people to look and think about their cars differently . \u201d\nThe notion of banning cars in the Finnish capital is not new . The Green League , which consolidated its foothold as the second largest party in Helsinki in April \u2019 s city council election , openly supports such a ban . However , as the preponderance of voters who cast their ballots for the \u201c pro-car \u201d conservative National Coalition Party made clear , an outright ban is not in the works , at least for the moment .\nThat \u2019 s all right with Helsinki \u2019 s transportation community . \u201c I don \u2019 t believe that cars in Finland or Helsinki will be banned , \u201d says Lehmuskoski . \u201c I believe that walking , cycling , and public transport will be more and more user-friendly so that competitiveness of passenger cars will decrease . Pricing of car traffic may also increase attractiveness of sustainable modes in the future . \u201d\nAnne Berner , Finnish minister of Transport and Communications , also discourages the notion that public transport and the private car are incompatible . \u201c There has been a lot of discussion , including heated exchanges , in Helsinki about future transport policy and infrastructure choices , \u201d says Ms. Berner . \u201c But overall I would say that most people see public transport and private car use as complementing each other . Many people also acknowledge that to meet our strict emission targets and cut CO2 emissions , some changes are needed . \u201d\nOf course , letting go of the idea of owning a car is easier to do in a city that has one of the more efficient and popular metropolitan and regional transport systems in Europe . As any visitor to the Finnish capital can attest , Helsinki \u2019 s trams , subways , and buses are attractive , well maintained , efficient , and nearly always on time .\nNiklas Sj\u0161blom/Courtesy of Helsinki City Transport One of Helsinki City Transport 's new Arctic trams crosses Senate Square at sunset .\nThe proportion of Helsinki \u2019 s population using public transport reached a peak in 1966 , when two-thirds of all Helsinkians \u2019 journeys within the metropolitan area were via public transport . That share declined during the 1970s and \u2019 80s as Finland rebounded from the war and more Finns were able to buy cars . Public transport \u2019 s share of total journeys bottomed out in 2008 at 42 percent .\nSince then , its share has been rising again , a trend the city leaders are happy to encourage .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very satisfied with the quality of public transport , \u201d says Heidi Silvennoinen , a young architect who lives in Otaniemi , a suburb of Helsinki . \u201c I mostly travel from Otaniemi , which is 15 minutes away . Buses run every 10 minutes during rush hour and every half-hour during the rest of the day and until 5 in the morning . \u201d\n\u201c With that level of convenience , why would I need to buy a car ? \u201d she adds .\nFinland has a history of marshaling its spatial and economic resources and thinking out of the box . Witness the way Finland transformed itself from an agricultural society to an industrial-based one after the devastation of World War II . Or how Finns , led by Jorma Ollila , CEO of the telecom giant Nokia , ignited the telecommunications revolution of the 1990s \u2013 and helped power the country out of that decade \u2019 s economic depression .\nIndeed , there is a direct connection between the thinking behind Nokia and the new \u201c mobility as a service \u201d ( MaaS ) philosophy that Helsinki is trying to bring to the challenge of phasing out the car . As Sampo Hietanen , CEO of MaaS Global , one of the start-ups behind the car rethink , points out , transportation and mobility \u201c are commodities that we need to have to be in contact with each other . \u201d\n\u201c I would argue that the potential for productivity gains in mobility will be the biggest driver for economic growth in the next few decades , \u201d says Mr. Hietanen . \u201c Eighty-five percent of the market value of a single-occupancy vehicle that is used 4 percent of the time . \u201d\nThe ultimate objective of the MaaS \u201c movement \u201d is to provide residents of Helsinki with a range of options so cheap , flexible , and well coordinated that it becomes competitive with private car ownership , in terms of both cost and convenience . Subscribers to MaaS Global , which promotes itself as a \u201c carefree , environmentally sound alternative to owning a car , \u201d would specify an origin and a destination . The MaaS Global app would then function as both a journey planner and universal payment platform , fusing everything from driverless cars and buses to shared bikes and ferries into a \u201c mesh \u201d of mobility .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a different way of \u2018 connecting people , \u2019 \u201d says Hietanen , referencing a former Nokia slogan .\nAs far as Berner , the minister of Transport , is concerned , this kind of innovative transportation thinking is a moral and environmental imperative for Finland , as well as an economic one . With the rapidly expanding capital \u2019 s arterial and ring roads congested with traffic , Finnish authorities are willing to try anything that has a realistic prospect of reducing the number of cars , while providing a similar level of convenience .\nTransport planners already have a good \u201c template \u201d to work with , both in terms of the number of car-owning households and the quality of the current public transportation system . As Mr. Forsblom points out , \u201c The fact is , today the majority of households in Helsinki \u2013 about 55 percent \u2013 are carless . \u201d\n\u201c The importance of public transport has steadily grown in city planning , \u201d says Pekka Sauri , Helsinki \u2019 s deputy mayor . As proof of the city \u2019 s commitment to public transport , Mr. Sauri cites the new multibillion-euro light rail line being built to connect several parts of Helsinki with the neighboring city of Espoo , as well as a fast bus line to connect the two metropolises .\nAt the same time , officials are trying to make it easier for Helsinkians to let go of their cars \u2013 or at least their second cars \u2013 and switch to public transport by converting a number of the congested main roads into \u201c city boulevards , \u201d with lower speed limits and high-speed trams . They \u2019 re also widening walking areas in the city .\nSauri admits that enabling car mobility is low on his list of city mobility priorities . \u201c The mobility priorities in city planning are , in descending order , walking , cycling , public transport , deliveries , and private cars , \u201d says the longtime city manager .\nSurprisingly , many car dealers are open to the government \u2019 s push to phase out , or at least deemphasize , the car . \u201c I think it \u2019 s understandable that the government would wish to restrict or phase out the car if it is to fulfill its environmental directives , \u201d says Tomi Riihim\u00e4ki , CEO of Autocompany , a private high-end secondhand auto and boat dealership .\nMr. Riihim\u00e4ki , who has been in the car business since the 1980s , confirms that attitudes toward car ownership among Helsinkians have changed , particularly among young people . \u201c Many young people have given up driving , \u201d he says . Nevertheless , he says business is good .\nOne thing he notices is that people are thinking more about what kind of car they want . He also has seen a surge in interest in electric cars , particularly among Millennials .\nRiihim\u00e4ki , who lives in Katajanokka , on the edge of the Helsinki peninsula , notes that he is an avid user of Helsinki \u2019 s public transport system . \u201c I use public transport every time I can , \u201d he says . \u201c If anything , I would like to see the city institute more ferries to make better use of our water lines . After all , we are located on a cape . \u201d\nBut Helsinki \u2019 s progress toward a brave new digitalized transport millennium has not been a straight line . Witness the city government \u2019 s decision to pull the plug on its much-heralded Kutsuplus . For a year and a half , the pioneering on-demand minibus service had allowed riders to choose their own route and summon a trip in real time with their smartphone .\nAjelo , a local tech start-up , developed the dispatch system , which was able to constantly adapt routes for each bus , aggregate user requests in real time , and calculate journeys to accommodate every passenger \u2013 in a sense , what MaaS purports to do . Helsinki Region Transport Authority managed the vehicles . But at the end of 2015 , the new system , which charged more than a normal bus but less than a taxi , was abandoned because it required too much of a subsidy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s unfortunate that Kutsuplus didn \u2019 t pan out , \u201d says Forsblom . \u201c Nevertheless , it was a valuable experiment which resulted in a lot of new know-how and changed our thinking about the possibilities of on-demand driven transportation . \u201d\nThis suits the Finnish government just fine . If Helsinki can serve as an incubator for new ideas in transportation that other countries can use , as it did with telecommunications in the \u2019 90s , so much the better . In fact , the government sees the possibility of leveraging Finnish expertise in transportation into an exportable product that can help lift the country out of its current economic doldrums \u2013 just as Nokia did .\nAs Berner states optimistically , \u201c We have the right ingredients to succeed at this , including the entrepreneurial energy and tech know-how . So hopefully we are seeing the birth of a thriving and exportable mobility ecosystem . \u201d\nOr as Forsblom puts it , \u201c Our own domestic problems are rather small , but we \u2019 d like to use our experience and ideas to help other cities and societies find a better and more rational way of using their resources . \u201d\nAfter all , Finns figure , if they \u2019 ve shown the world how to connect one way , why not another ?",
