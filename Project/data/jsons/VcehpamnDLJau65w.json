Americans are joining their ranks by the thousands , rapidly expanding the group 's membership rolls in just a few years .\nAnd a sharply leftist political agenda that once produced eye rolls \u2013 on everything from their opposition to capitalism to their questioning the very existence of prisons \u2013 has become a serious topic of discussion on social media , and in mainstream political debate .\nIn short , it \u2019 s going according to a plan by the Democratic Socialists of America , a group that \u2019 s dedicated to pushing an anti-capitalist , socialist platform by infiltrating and working within the Democratic Party , and pushing it further and further to the left .\n\u201c Progressive and socialist candidates who openly reject the neoliberal mainstream Democratic agenda may choose for pragmatic reasons to use the Democratic Party ballot line in partisan races , \u201d wrote Joseph M. Schwartz , vice chairman of the DSA , in the socialist Jacobin Magazine last August . \u201c But whatever ballot line the movement chooses to use , we must always be working to increase the independent power of labor and the left . \u201d\nThe Democratic Socialists playbook , detailed on its website , calls for a methodical march to becoming a truly national force \u2013 where they can run candidates and push ideas under a Socialist Party banner \u2013 by first working from within the Democratic establishment . That strategy paid off big with the recent congressional primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a 28-year-old DSA member who much of the media has ordained the new face of the Democratic Party .\nOcasio-Cortez plans to stump for other Democratic primary candidates in the coming days , in Kansas and Michigan . Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , a self-described Democratic socialist , reportedly will join for one of the stops .\nThe DSA , which is not a formal political party but bills itself as the largest socialist organization in the U.S. , is working its way into the Democratic Party in part because of its failure to advance its own brand with a voting public reflexively suspicious of hard-left socialist policies . So it set a goal of working with groups devoted to a wide range of issues like health care , college debt , immigration , and racism to see socialism \u2013 and Democratic Socialist political candidates \u2013 as the vehicle for policy changes .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t relate politically to social forces bigger than our own , DSA could devolve into merely a large socialist sect or subculture , \u201d wrote Schwartz and his co-author , Bhaskar Sunkara , founder of Jacobin Magazine .\nThe organization also has recognized it needs to broaden the diversity of its own membership , which it concedes is predominately white , male and upper-income .\n\u201c We will focus on overcoming this historic bias of our organization toward white ( particularly male ) activists . We will do this by building deeper ties with organizations representing poor and working-class women and people of color \u2026 We must do so with humility and take our lead from the organizations that organize and are led by poor and working-class people in those communities . \u201d\n\u201c They seem very pragmatic , which to me doesn \u2019 t seem very Socialist , \u201d said Daniel Pout , an instructor at Arizona State University \u2019 s School of Politics and Global Studies . \u201c They have to almost be non-socialist in order to be popular . \u201d\nThe DSA \u2019 s effort to push their causes through the Democratic political machine has met with success . Ocasio-Cortez has grabbed the headlines and broad media attention , but the DSA claims its candidates have won 22 of some 30 elections they took part in .\nWhatever the numbers , it \u2019 s become trendy for Democratic Party candidates to align themselves with the Democratic Socialists . One of the more prominent examples is Cynthia Nixon , the former \u201c Sex and the City \u201d actress who is running against Gov . Andrew Cuomo in the New York Democratic gubernatorial primary .\nWhatever [ political party ] ballot line the [ socialist ] movement chooses to use , we must always be working to increase the independent power of labor and the left . \u2014 Joseph M. Schwartz , vice chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America ( DSA )\n\u201c It \u2019 s nice to see that our policies and what we espouse are resonating with people running for governor , \u201d said Abdullah Younous , co-chair of DSA \u2019 s New York City chapter , to Politico . \u201c The landscape is really shifting , and people are noticing it across the state . \u201d\nAnd the Democratic establishment , feeling the pressure to perform well in this year 's midterm elections , does n't seem terribly concerned about the DSA 's efforts to push the party even further left .\n`` The DNC 's mission is to elect Democrats from the school board to the oval office , and we welcome the help of all organizations to achieve that goal , '' said Sabrina Singh , deputy communications director for the Democratic National Committee . The DSA declined to comment for this article .\nThat leaves Democratic Socialists in a position to withhold their endorsement if a Democratic candidate isn \u2019 t far-left enough , posing a challenge to those who see the group as a vehicle to boost their chances of getting elected .\nA flyer at a New York City DSA meeting to discuss whether to endorse Nixon was quoted by Politico as saying : \u201c We don \u2019 t just grant endorsements to progressives who beg us for one .
