A jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder late Saturday night and declined to convict him on a lesser charge of manslaughter.However , with many critics angry over his acquittal , his freedom will likely be limited.Demonstrators upset with the verdict protested mostly peacefully in Florida and Atlanta overnight , but some broke windows and vandalized a police squad car in Oakland during protests in four California cities , authorities said . `` He 's going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life , '' Robert Zimmerman Jr. said during an interview on CNN.Martin 's killing in February 2012 unleashed furious debate across the U.S. over racial profiling , self-defense and equal justice .

Many , including Martin 's parents , claimed Zimmerman had racially profiled the unarmed black teen .

While defense attorneys said they were thrilled with the outcome , O'Mara suggested Zimmerman 's safety would be an ongoing concern . `` There still is a fringe element that wants revenge , '' O'Mara said . `` They wo n't listen to a verdict of not guilty . `` Those watching reacted strongly when the verdict was announced .
