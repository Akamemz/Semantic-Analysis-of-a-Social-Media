But his misconduct can not be ignored simply for the sake of political convenience \u2026 \u201c Polls suggest that in the partisan media landscape , many voters \u2019 opinions have already calcified , but it remains likely that a full and public accounting of Trump \u2019 s copious wrongdoing , broadcast on television and covered in detail by the media , could change minds in a way that an abrupt party-line vote on a narrow and esoteric set of issues might not . Trump \u2019 s violations of the emoluments clause alone would probably provide enough fodder for hearings that could last well into the summer , a political and media event that might drive home to the American people the extent of his corruption and the gravity of the 2020 vote. \u201d Moira Donegan , The Guardian\nOthers posit that \u201c To make clear the full gravity of what Trump tried to do in Ukraine , Democrats need to demonstrate that it was part of a pattern \u2026 public opinion on impeachment is unlikely to move much no matter what Democrats do . Nevertheless , they \u2019 d be mad to let centrist trepidation stop them from making the strongest possible case for Trump \u2019 s removal . Doing that requires a willingness to put Trump \u2019 s Ukraine corruption in context. \u201d Michelle Goldberg , New York Times\nMany argue that \u201c The Democrats would be wise to focus narrowly on Ukraine . Focused impeachment articles would not detract from the power of the charges against Mr. Trump . They would be more persuasive to the many Americans who hesitated to support impeachment before the Ukraine affair emerged \u2014 a group that includes Ms. Pelosi and many other top Democrats\u2026 the current impeachment process enjoys a legitimacy that it would not otherwise have if Democrats had jumped to impeach based on Mr. Mueller \u2019 s findings alone . That Ms. Pelosi resisted impeachment for so long lends credibility to the argument that Mr. Trump \u2019 s conduct toward Ukraine was not just very bad but unique and unacceptable. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c If Mr. Trump is so clear in his own mind that he didn \u2019 t try to pressure the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2020 election , why won \u2019 t he send the secretary of state , Mike Pompeo , to testify under oath that there was no quid pro quo ? Instead , he has issued a blanket refusal to allow officials of his administration to testify or submit documents demanded by Congress\u2026 the people clearly need to hear from material witnesses like Mr. Pompeo and the former national security adviser , John Bolton , both of whom have been said by sworn witnesses to have firsthand knowledge of whether President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to help him win the 2020 election . Their silence is its own form of negligence toward the public \u2019 s trust. \u201d Editorial Board , New York Times\n\u201c Witness after witness testified that the president held up desperately needed , congressionally approved aid to Ukraine to extort a personal political favor for himself\u2026 [ It is ] highly likely that Trump would be \u2014 will be \u2014 acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate , and that , rightly or wrongly , he would point to that in his reelection campaign as exoneration . But those concerns must yield to the overwhelming evidence that Trump perverted U.S. foreign policy for his own political gain . That sort of misconduct is outrageous and corrosive of democracy . It can \u2019 t be ignored by the House , and it merits a full trial by the Senate on whether to remove him from office. \u201d Editorial Board , Los Angeles Times\n\u201c When Burisma announced [ Hunter ] Biden \u2019 s appointment to its board in the spring of 2014 , every media outlet under the sun covered the news\u2026 were Trump or congressional Republicans actually concerned about corruption in Ukraine , they had years to say something about it . That they \u2019 re only now speaking up proves perhaps as well as anything that the president \u2019 s pressure on Ukraine was about nothing but extorting a foreign country to interfere in U.S. politics for Trump \u2019 s political benefit. \u201d James Downie , Washington Post\n\u201c Election-related bribery thwarts the very process by which voters can normally check corruption : voting the bums out\u2026 The solution to election corruption can not be a corrupt election .

How many people do you know who say , \u2018 You know , I was on the fence about Trump until I found out about this Ukraine thing . Now I \u2019 m convinced : He has to be impeached \u2019 ? I \u2019 m betting few , if any , Americans think that way .

In fact , nearly as many registered voters in the poll said that Trump \u2019 s conduct towards Ukraine was no different from how presidents normally conduct foreign policy as voters who said otherwise\u2026\n\u201c The real worry for Dems is that swing voters who took a chance on electing a Democratic House last fall will conclude that this is all Pelosi and the rest of them really care about .

None of that is getting done , thanks to Democrats \u2019 focus on impeachment\u2026 while [ Pelosi ] can strong-arm the moderates in her caucus , she can \u2019 t strong-arm the voters in their districts . Her decision to move forward with impeachment means that many of those 31 Democrats seem destined to lose in November . \u201d\n\u201c To be effective , [ the Democrats \u2019 legal witnesses ] needed to show lofty objectivity .
