    "content": "On Sunday , May 19 , New York Times finance editor David Enrich got a request from a producer at MSNBC to appear on Rachel Maddow \u2019 s show the following night . Enrich had a red-hot front-page story for Monday \u2019 s paper , about anti-money-laundering specialists at Deutsche Bank flagging suspicious transactions involving Donald Trump and Jared Kushner , and Maddow wanted to bring him on air to talk about it .\nMaddow is MSNBC \u2019 s ratings queen , jostling with Sean Hannity every night for the crown of most-watched time slot in cable news . That \u2019 s why reporters tend to relish the exposure they get from doing her show . Enrich said yes , but after mentioning the planned appearance to the Times \u2019 s communications department , he was told he would have to retroactively decline . The reason ? The Times was wary of how viewers might perceive a down-the-middle journalist like Enrich talking politics with a mega-ideological host like Maddow . The producer , who was informed that the Times asks members of the newsroom not to appear on opinionated shows to discuss political subjects , was miffed about the cancellation , sources said . Enrich declined to comment . An MSNBC spokesman said , \u201c For over a decade , The Rachel Maddow Show has welcomed the best journalists from across the country and celebrated the hard work they do , day-in and day-out . This includes countless New York Times reporters and editors . That commitment to journalism is part of the DNA of the show . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just Maddow . The Times has come to \u201c prefer , \u201d as sources put it , that its reporters steer clear of any cable-news shows that the masthead perceives as too partisan , and managers have lately been advising people not to go on what they see as highly opinionated programs . It 's not clear how many shows fall under that umbrella in the eyes of Times brass , but two others that definitely do are Lawrence O \u2019 Donnell \u2019 s and Don Lemon \u2019 s , according to people familiar with management \u2019 s thinking . Hannity \u2019 s or Tucker Carlson \u2019 s shows would likewise make the cut , but it 's not like Times reporters ever do those anyway . I \u2019 m told that over the past couple of months , executive editor Dean Baquet has felt that opinionated cable-news show are getting , well , even more opinionated . Baquet and other managers have become increasingly concerned that if a Times reporter were to go on one of these shows , his or her appearance could be perceived as being aligned with that show \u2019 s political leanings . \u201c He thinks it \u2019 s a real issue , \u201d one of my Times sources said . \u201c Their view , \u201d said another , \u201c is that , intentionally or not , it affiliates the Times reporter with a bias . \u201d\nIt 's not so much a new policy as a reinforcement of an old one . Reached for comment , a Times spokeswoman pointed me to the section of the Times \u2019 s \u201c Ethical Journalism \u201d handbook that covers broadcast media appearances : \u201c In deciding whether to make a radio , television or Internet appearance , a staff member should consider its probable tone and content to make sure they are consistent with Times standards . Staff members should avoid strident , theatrical forums that emphasize punditry and reckless opinion-mongering. \u201d Without question , this is not how MSNBC 's anchors see their shows ( or CNN 's for that matter ) . And these guidelines were crafted back in the mid-aughts , a media moment that seems downright quaint compared to today . ( What forum is more \u201c strident and theatrical \u201d than Twitter , where many a Times reporter spends hours of their day ? Of course Twitter has been its own minefield for the Times . )",
