But soon they \u2019 ll be a member of Congress .\nThe rookies show up on Capitol Hill wide-eyed , not knowing their way to the restrooms let alone the path to the House floor . There \u2019 s usually a small reception for supporters and family members , featuring punch and finger foods in the bare-bones , stripped-down Capitol Hill office that belonged to their predecessor . Then the victor heads across the street from the House office buildings to the Capitol for a mock swearing-in with the speaker of the House .\nFamily members clamor around the congressman-elect for the photo-op . An official photographer snaps photos of the speaker posing with the family . The speaker usually jokes around and makes light conversation . The lawmaker-elect fumbles with the family Bible and inevitably raises the wrong hand before the speaker corrects them . Finally everyone stands up straight and smiles for the money shot .\nA few local reporters sometimes fly in from the politician \u2019 s home state . They furiously scribble down \u201c color \u201d in their notebooks for their pieces about the lawmaker-elect \u2019 s day .\n\u201c P . Ryan taller in person \u201d jotted down an out-of-town , female correspondent at one recent ceremony . Sometimes a camera crew or two shoots a few frames of video . The networks may show up . Maybe not . Then the speaker \u2019 s staff escorts the newbie to the House floor for the official swearing-in .\nThat \u2019 s where the real thing happens . The House is almost always in the middle of a vote series . The swearing-in comes between the first and second roll call tally . The speaker climbs to the dais to preside . Bipartisan members from the congressman-elect \u2019 s state squeeze into the well of the chamber . Sometimes the state \u2019 s senators walk across the Capitol to observe .\nThe most-senior member of the delegation usually makes a few glowing remarks about the latest addition to the House . The speaker then asks the member-elect to present himself or herself in the well and raise their right hand . The speaker administers the oath of office . Everyone cheers . The speaker then asks the now congressman or congresswoman to deliver a short speech .\nThe most-junior member of the House thanks a lot of people . They hope they can work with members from both sides of the aisle to get things done . They discuss what an honor it is to become a House member .\nThey acknowledge their family members sitting in the gallery above the floor . Then it \u2019 s over . The speaker announces the updated membership of the House and the body returns to voting . Someone has to instruct the new representative how to use the voting machine because , well , they \u2019 re now a member of Congress and voting is kind of important around here .\nThis ritual plays out multiple times each Congress following a special election victory . Some newly-minted lawmakers arrive on Capitol Hill with \u201c celebrity \u201d status . That may command a few more reporters and cameras if someone emerges victorious from a high-pitched special election . Their win could represent a political bellwether or forecast a trend for the next election .\nThe formalities to swear-in Rep. Warren Davidson , R-Ohio , received sizable attention in June of last year . Davidson won a special election to take the Ohio House seat vacated by former GOP House Speaker John Boehner .\nNot as many reporters and cameras materialized in November of last year to swear-in Reps. James Comer , R-N.Y. , Dwight Evans , D-Pa. , and Colleen Hanabusa , D-Hawaii .\nThat trio was elected to fill out terms of members who either resigned due to scandal or died . Comer and Evans were brand-new to the Capitol . Hanabusa returned to the House after an unsuccessful Senate bid .\nBut these customs usually don \u2019 t garner much attention amid the daily political maelstroms that consume Capitol Hill . The new members usually fade into congressional oblivion unless they \u2019 re a known figure . A case in point was the 2013 return to elected office by Rep. Mark Sanford , R-S.C .\nThe South Carolina legislature censured Sanford after lying about his affair and covert trip to Argentina to visit his paramour , Maria Belen Chapur while he was governor . Sanford then succeeded now-Sen. Tim Scott , R-S.C. , in the House -- a position he held previously for six years .\nThere was a little bit of press for the ersatz swearing-in of Rep. Ron Estes , R-Kansas , this spring to succeed CIA Director and former Rep. Mike Pompeo , R-Kansas . That \u2019 s because Democrats made the right-leaning district somewhat competitive in hopes of stealing the seat .\nBut brace yourself for what will unfold when Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte , R-Mont. , arrives on Capitol Hill to be sworn-in come early June .\nThe speaker \u2019 s office hasn \u2019 t yet set the date to swear-in Gianforte . It \u2019 s likely to be June 6 or 7 . But reporters may well be staking out suite 1419 Longworth vacated by Interior Secretary and former Rep. Ryan Zinke , R-Mont. , now just to holler a few questions at Gianforte .\nOne can only imagine how many cameras will cram into the speaker \u2019 s ceremonial office for the mock swearing-in , to say nothing of those rubbering into the press gallery for the real thing .\nHow will lawmakers interact with Gianforte ? Will Republicans shun him ? How jocular will House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , be with Gianforte compared to other special election winners ? What will Gianforte say to the House ? Will a din of applause and cheering swell in the House chamber once Gianforte takes the oath ?\nWill Montana \u2019 s two senators , Sens . Jon Tester , a Democrat , and Steve Daines , Republican , appear for the ceremony ? The absence of either or both would be noticeable .\nMontana sends but a three-person delegation to Washington , and Gianforte will be the only House member . How does Gianforte comport himself after he \u2019 s here ? Does he deliberately fade from the public view ? It \u2019 s hard to become a member of the \u201c Invisible Caucus \u201d on Capitol Hill when you \u2019 ve done something as visible as Gianforte .\nGianforte is expected in court sometime in the next few days after the Gallatin County , Montana Sheriff \u2019 s Department issued a misdemeanor citation for body-slamming reporter Ben Jacobs of The Guardian . Don \u2019 t think that Democrats -- who are trying to put the House into play in 2018 -- won \u2019 t notice with whom Gianforte associates .\n\u201c He 's going to learn very quickly that once you \u2019 re a member , it is a lot harder to run away from your party or a tough vote , \u201d said a senior House Democratic aide .\nHow will Gianforte \u2019 s relations with the press play out ? In 2014 , then-Rep. Michael Grimm , R-N.Y. , threatened to throw a New York TV reporter off a ledge in the Cannon House Office Building . \u201c I \u2019 ll break you in half \u2026 like a boy , \u201d boasted Grimm . Grimm later resigned and did time , convicted of corruption charges .\nRyan declared he wouldn \u2019 t stand in the way of seating Gianforte .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to let them decide who they want , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s not our choice . \u201d\nArticle I , Section 5 of the Constitution grants both the House and Senate the right to \u201c be the Judge of the Elections , Returns and Qualifications of its own Members . \u201d\nThere hasn \u2019 t been a big brouhaha over seating a House member since 1984-85 . Democrats ignored the Indiana election certification of Republican Rick McIntyre over Rep. Frank McCloskey , D-Ind. , in 1984 .\nDemocrats refused to seat either candidate until a bipartisan task force investigated the matter . Months later , the Democrat-controlled House decided McCloskey won the race by four votes . GOPers cried foul . The House voted along party lines to seat McCloskey .\nThe House \u2019 s Code of Conduct requires lawmakers to \u201c behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House . \u201d\nMoreover , the bylaws of the House Ethics Committee allows that panel \u201c to undertake an inquiry or investigation \u201d to probe a member \u2019 s conduct . The incident with Jacobs unfolded prior to Gianforte \u2019 s membership in the House .\nHouse rules and precedents limit the scope of a possible investigation to only when someone is a member . The House has rules about barring members from sitting on committees or voting if they \u2019 ve been convicted of a felony . So far , Gianforte hasn \u2019 t been convicted of anything and the charge is just a misdemeanor .\nIt \u2019 s possible the quasi-governmental Office of Congressional Ethics ( OCE ) could receive a complaint from a member of the public to probe Gianforte .
