Chao , who ran the Labor Department under President George W. Bush , as his transportation secretary \u2014 a position that could be key to the president-elect \u2019 s plans for a massive infrastructure program that includes rebuilding roads and bridges throughout the country .\nAccording to multiple reports , Mr. Trump also has chosen Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary , a choice whose Wall Street ties Democrats quickly touted as a betrayal of Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign promises to \u201c drain the swamp \u201d of special interests in Washington .\nAlthough Democrats suggested an openness to Ms. Chao , who is the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , they said they \u2019 ll also rally against Mr. Price , a staunch pro-life advocate and architect of House Republicans \u2019 budgets the last two years \u2014 blueprints that envisioned major changes to Medicare and called for fast-track procedures to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act .\nRepublicans plan to rely on those same fast-track tools to attempt a repeal in 2017 , when they \u2019 ll have GOP allies in the administration .\n\u201c We could not ask for a better partner to work with Congress to fix our nation \u2019 s health care challenges , \u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said .\nMr. Price offered his own legislative alternative to Obamacare for years , pushing for the repeal of heavy government mandates while maintaining some form of tax credits to help Americans to buy insurance , allowing insurers to sell their products across states lines and setting up high-risk pools in states \u2014 ideas that Mr. Ryan incorporated into his election-year outline for replacing Mr. Obama \u2019 s overhaul with a GOP president .\nThe incoming Republican president , Mr. Trump , said he \u2019 s counting on Mr. Price to manage the GOP \u2019 s tricky path ahead .\n\u201c He is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare , and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\n\u201c Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house , \u201d said incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .\nMr. Price succeeded Mr. Ryan as chairman of the Budget Committee in 2015 , and adopted Mr. Ryan \u2019 s push to morph Medicare into a premium-support program . That idea is a political lightning rod that didn \u2019 t win over Mr. Trump on the campaign trail .\nMr. Price also has supported turning Medicaid coverage for the poor into a block grant to the states and stripping federal funding from Planned Parenthood , the nation \u2019 s largest abortion provider .\nDemocrats said as health secretary , Mr. Price would have control over funding and policies governing federal policies on abortion and contraceptives \u2014 areas where they said the pro-life congressman could undo Obama administration decisions .\nThough a less prominent role than HHS secretary , Ms. Verma would have direct management over the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s twin pillars \u2014 web-based exchanges where consumers can shop for private coverage , often with the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies , and the state-by-state expansion of Medicaid , the government insurance program for the poor .\nMs. Verma rose to prominence by setting up the Healthy Indiana Plan , the state \u2019 s conservative twist on Medicaid expansion that started under former Gov .
