A new U.N. report on warming and land use says climate change is hitting us where it counts : the stomach . The scientific report on Thursday , Aug. 8 , finds that as the world warms it degrades the land more . ( AP Photo/Luca Bruno , File )\nGENEVA ( AP ) \u2014 Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth \u2019 s land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse , a new United Nations scientific report says . That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive , scarcer and less nutritious .\n\u201c The cycle is accelerating , \u201d said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig , a co-author of the report . \u201c The threat of climate change affecting people \u2019 s food on their dinner table is increasing . \u201d\nBut if people change the way they eat , grow food and manage forests , it could help save the planet from a far warmer future , scientists said .\nEarth \u2019 s land masses , which are only 30 % of the globe , are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole . While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere , the land has been less talked about as part of climate change . A special report , written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva , proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings .\n\u201c The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution , \u201d said Valerie Masson-Delmotte , a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel \u2019 s working groups . \u201c Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable . \u201d\nScientists at Thursday \u2019 s press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want a message of despair , \u201d said science panel official Jim Skea , a professor at Imperial College London . \u201c We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference . \u201d\nStill the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying . As a person , it \u2019 s pretty scary , \u201d Koko Warner , a manager in the U.N . Climate Change secretariat who helped write a report chapter on risk management and decision-making , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 after the report was presented at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva . \u201c We need to act urgently . \u201d\nThe report said climate change already has worsened land degradation , caused deserts to grow , permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought , fire , pests and disease . That \u2019 s happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air . Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth .\n\u201c Climate change is really slamming the land , \u201d said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin , who wasn \u2019 t part of the study .\n\u201c The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases , \u201d the report said .\nIn the worst-case scenario , food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now . They go from high to \u201c very high \u201d risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1 degree Celsius ) of warming from now .\n\u201c The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing , \u201d NASA \u2019 s Rosenzweig said . \u201c Just to give examples , the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks . \u201d\nScientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide , the major heat-trapping gas , was that it made plants grow more and the world greener , Rosenzweig said . But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops .\nFor example , high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 % to 13 % less protein , 4 % to 7 % less zinc and 5 % to 8 % less iron , she said .\nBut better farming practices \u2014 such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications \u2014 have the potential to fight global warming too , reducing carbon pollution up to 18 % of current emissions levels by 2050 , the report said .\nIf people change their diets , reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods , such as fruits , vegetables and seeds , the world can save as much as another 15 % of current emissions by mid-century . It would also make people more healthy , Rosenzweig said .\nThe science panel said they aren \u2019 t telling people what to eat because that \u2019 s a personal choice .\nStill , Hans-Otto P\u00f6rtner , a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption , told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables \u201c that \u2019 s a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions . \u201d\nReducing food waste can fight climate change even more . The report said that between 2010 and 2016 , global food waste accounted for 8 % to 10 % of heat-trapping emissions .\n\u201c Currently 25 % -30 % of total food produced is lost or wasted , \u201d the report said . Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land .\nWith just another 0.9 degrees F of warming ( 0.5 degrees C ) , which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years , the risk of unstable food supplies , wildfire damage , thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas \u201c are projected to be high , \u201d the report said .\nAt another 1.8 degrees F of warming ( 1 degree C ) from now , which could happen in about 50 years , it said those risks \u201c are projected to be very high . \u201d\nMost scenarios predict the world \u2019 s tropical regions will have \u201c unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century , \u201d the report noted .\nAgriculture and forestry together account for about 23 % of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth , slightly less than from cars , trucks , boats and planes . Add in transporting food , energy costs , packaging and that grows to 37 % , the report said .\nBut the land is also a great carbon \u201c sink , \u201d which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air .\nFrom about 2007 to 2016 , agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons ( 5.2 billion metric tons ) of carbon dioxide into the air , but pulled 12.3 billion tons ( 11.2 billion metric tons ) of it out .\n\u201c This additional gift from nature is limited . It \u2019 s not going to continue forever , \u201d said study co-author Luis Verchot , a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia . \u201c If we continue to degrade ecosystems , if we continue to convert natural ecosystems , we continue to deforest and we continue to destroy our soils , we \u2019 re going to lose this natural subsidy . \u201d\nOverall land emissions are increasing , especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil , Colombia and Peru , Verchot said .\nRecent forest management changes in Brazil \u201c contradicts all the messages that are coming out of the report , \u201d P\u00f6rtner said .\nSaying \u201c our current way of living and our economic system risks our future and the future of our children , \u201d Germany \u2019 s environment minister , Svenja Schulze , questioned whether it makes sense for a country like Germany to import large amounts of soy from Latin America , where forests are being destroyed to plant the crop , to feed unsustainable numbers of livestock in Germany .\n\u201c We ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it , \u201d said Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field , who wasn \u2019 t part of the report .\nAP Science Writer Seth Borenstein reported from Washington .
