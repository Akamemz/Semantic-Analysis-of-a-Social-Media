It 's getting difficult to categorize the conflict simply as a humanitarian crisis or a `` teacup war '' of secondary significance . Rather , Syria 's civil war is increasingly fought under a great-power cloud that has n't been seen in the Middle East for decades .\nMost of Washington would rather ignore the darkening forecast . In one of his periodic Washington Post op-eds , Henry Kissinger warned that a `` Syrian intervention risks upsetting [ the ] global order . '' While Kissinger went on to acknowledge that the fall of Assad 's regime would suit the national interests of the United States in both humanitarian and strategic terms , he concluded that an armed intervention would fail to meet his two tests for U.S. involvement . First , there was no consensus on what kind of regime would replace Assad 's . Second , there was no assurance that the `` political objective '' \u2014 call it `` victory '' \u2014 could be achieved `` in a domestically sustainable time period . ''\nIn short , Kissinger spoke in the voice of regretful realism . From this perspective , the Syrian civil war is an unfortunate event , a human catastrophe , a strategic opportunity to remove a regime that 's been a longtime pest , but , if it requires a serious and enduring American commitment , not a reason to upset the international order .\nThis appears to reflect the thinking of the Obama administration . The president said last August that the time had come for Assad `` to step aside , '' but has yet to do anything to force the issue .\nThe problem with this sort of realism is that it is n't really realistic , insofar as it fails to appreciate the balance of power . If Assad stays , the global order will be very much affected , and one of the most significant features of the post-Cold War order will be threatened . In particular , the United States ' ability to push for fundamental political change in the greater Middle East with a free hand will be severely curtailed . The Syrian crisis then is a big deal , not only in the region , but also in global terms .\nOnce upon a time , the Middle East was thought to be a square on the Cold War chessboard , part of the larger `` game of thrones '' with the Soviet Union . The United States had to curry favor with a host of regional autocrats , lest the Russians accumulate a larger roster of thugs . Washington had the Shah 's Iran and Saudi Arabia , Moscow had a natural rapport with Baath party bosses in Syria and Iraq , and the Egyptians teased both sides until they satisfied their honor in the 1973 war with Israel \u2014 itself a conflict that sparked a nerve-racking U.S.-Soviet faceoff . The Carter Doctrine , formulated in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , held that the United States would resist the efforts of any outside power to dominate the region .\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union , the great game in the Middle East changed profoundly , even though American security interests did not . Saddam Hussein thought that the end of the Cold War gave him a green light to invade Kuwait , but he discovered that the Carter Doctrine had been expanded to apply to bids for hegemony that came from inside the region as well .\nStill , during the decade following Operation Desert Storm , the United States opted to contain Iraq rather than depose Saddam . A safe haven was established for Kurds in the north , and `` no-fly '' zones were maintained in the north and the south , with a `` no-drive '' zone in the south to protect Kuwait . Substantial U.S. air and land forces remained in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , with naval forces elsewhere in the Gulf . Keeping Saddam `` in his box '' meant staying in his face . Thus by the time Operation Iraqi Freedom started in 2003 , Iraq 's air defenses had already been suppressed , making the decisive march to Baghdad a three-week sprint . Likewise , in Afghanistan , the need for `` regime change '' had supplanted past predilections for containment .\nAlthough George W. Bush did little to push the `` friendly '' autocrats in Egypt or the Persian Gulf states to reform , he was willing to back his `` forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East '' with American military power to see through the regime-change commitments already made . President Barack Obama , on the other hand , has sought to shelter himself and the United States from the winds of change in the Middle East . This is the theme that runs from his `` New Beginnings '' address at Cairo University in June 2009 , to his response to Iranian protests , through his Iraq and Afghanistan policies , to his standoffish approach to the uprisings of the Arab Spring , to `` leading from behind '' in Libya , and now to the Syria crisis .\nAs he explained in Cairo , Obama believes this is a `` time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world '' that is `` rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate . '' Obama 's prime directive was to reestablish `` mutual interest '' and `` mutual respect '' between the United States and Muslim peoples , and to assert that `` no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other . '' He promised also to be `` respectful of the sovereignty of nations '' and to engage in negotiations with Iran `` without preconditions and on the basis of mutual respect . ''\nIronically , as Obama yearned for the `` engagement '' and realpolitik of a bygone era , the Muslims of the greater Middle East yearned for political change . Less than 10 days after the Cairo address , Iranians took to the streets to protest what they believed was a stolen election . The White House went silent . Iranian protesters responded by chanting , `` Obama ! Obama ! Either you are with us or with them ! '' Hoping for a deal to slow Iran 's nuclear program , the administration kept its open hand extended to the mullahs even during Tehran 's crackdown .\nObama 's response to the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 was equally uncertain , even regarding the revolt in Libya , which the White House now counts as one of its foreign policy successes . In February 2011 , protesters in Benghazi and elsewhere surged into the streets , and by early March , the administration declared that Qaddafi had `` lost his legitimacy to lead , and must go . '' But just as a no-fly zone was established , the administration announced that the United States would fall back into a supporting role once NATO assumed command . The president welcomed getting rid of Qaddafi but added that `` broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake . '' The administration would countenance regime change , but did n't want too many American fingerprints on it , and certainly no responsibility for what might come after .\nThe Syria conflict \u2014 now officially designated as a `` civil war '' by the U.N. 's peacekeeping chief \u2014 has similarly paralyzed Obama , and with far greater consequences . After the uprising began in March 2011 , it became apparent that Russia and China would prevent any repeat of the Libya resolution at the U.N . They permitted a nonbinding peace plan drafted by former secretary general Kofi Annan , which has had no effect whatsoever , and a condemnation of the regime 's indiscriminate use of heavy weaponry . In short , for the first time since the end of the Cold War , U.S. Middle East policy is once again subject to larger great power issues , and in this case , what amounts to a de facto veto by Moscow , backed by Beijing .\nThis week 's contretemps over the Syrian use of Russian-made attack helicopters underscores both the emerging proxy war character of the conflict and the Obama administration 's unwillingness to consider effective measures . Specifically , the White House has refused to back the Syrian opposition against an Iranian ally in a war that is ongoing , is certain to continue , is likely to expand , and whose outcome will matter .\n`` We have confronted the Russians about stopping their continued arms shipments to Syria , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week . The attack choppers would `` escalate the conflict quite dramatically , '' she contended , rightly . Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov countered that it was only sending weapons for `` self-defense . '' No regrets . In fact , the Russians are extremely pleased with themselves \u2014 they 're being courted just as in the Soviet days .\nThe Chinese have tried to remain in Moscow 's shadow , but they are equally opposed to taking actions that would put the Assad regime in jeopardy . This is not just the usual Chinese whinging over `` sovereignty . '' This week French foreign minister Laurent Fabius proposed escalating economic sanctions on Syria , but in Beijing , spokesman Liu Weimin responded that `` China disapproves of one-sided sanctions and pressuring . ''\nThe Syria standoff has already become a full-blown balance of power tussle , sucking in regional and global powers on both sides . China , Russia , and Iran back Assad , while the Syrian opposition is funded and armed by a variety of Gulf states . Turkey and Iraq are both inundated with Syrian refugees , and Ankara is increasingly angry that the Assad regime hosts Kurdish terrorists . In sum , Syria is becoming exactly the kind of nightmare that the region and the world have come to expect the United States to prevent , and which , indeed , until now , American administrations of both parties have taken great pains to preclude .\nUntil now . Obama has insisted that the `` tide of war '' across the Middle East is `` receding . '' It 's not just that American troops have been withdrawn from Iraq , are being more rapidly withdrawn from Afghanistan , or were not employed on the ground in Libya . It is the president 's belief that they need not \u2014 should not \u2014 be used again . This is an unrealistic belief , one that ignores balance-of-power politics . The survival of the Assad regime , saved by its Russian , Chinese , and Iranian sponsors , would upset the international order far beyond the troubles created by the regime 's demise .",
