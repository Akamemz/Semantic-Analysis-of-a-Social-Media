The 40 percent figure is an old and bogus statistic that was debunked a long time ago .\nIn January , the Washington Post fact checker gave Obama two pinocchios for using the figure .\nRather than being 30 to 40 percent ( the original estimate of the range ) or \u201c up to 40 percent \u201d ( Obama \u2019 s words ) , gun purchases without background checks amounted to 14 to 22 percent . And since the survey sample is so small , that means the results have a survey caveat : plus or minus six percentage points .\nMoreover , as we noted before , the survey was taken in late 1994 , eight months after the Brady law went into effect , and the questions were asked about gun purchases in the previous two years . So some of the answers concerned gun purchases that took place in a pre-Brady environment .\nDespite the figure being false , Obama has been using it to push for more gun control and will likely use it again today during his trip to Colorado where he we call for federal legislation criminilizing the private transfer of firearms .\nDuring a speech last week , Obama asked , \u201c Why wouldn \u2019 t we want to make it more difficult for a dangerous person to get his or her hand on a gun ?
