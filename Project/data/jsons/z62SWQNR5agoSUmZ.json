Mr. Jarrett , a massage therapist and actor , says this election changed the way he views American politics .\nDespite their numbers , only 46 percent of Millennials , 18-to-34 year olds , are likely to vote . They make up just 17 percent of likely voters in California .\nThat \u2019 s not unusual , as voters tend to participate more in elections as they grow older .
