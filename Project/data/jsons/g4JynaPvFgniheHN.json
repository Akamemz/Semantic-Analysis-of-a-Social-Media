    "content": "Donald Trump over the weekend delivered a closing argument against Hillary Clinton and the \u201c totally rigged system \u201d he says enables her \u2014 but the businessman \u2019 s presidential campaign expressed open frustration Sunday that a policy-centric message once again has been drowned out .\nTrailing badly in virtually all polls , Mr. Trump outlined plans for his first 100 days in office during a speech in Gettysburg on Saturday . In his attempt to put the focus on issues during the home stretch of the campaign , the Republican nominee offered himself as a \u201c once in a lifetime \u201d agent of change to revive the economy and stamp out Washington corruption , and he drew a stark contrast between his plan and the more-of-the-same government that he said Mrs. Clinton would run to benefit herself and her cronies .\nBut much of Mr. Trump \u2019 s pitch was lost as headlines instead focused on his vow to sue the 11 women that have come forward in recent weeks to accuse him of sexual assault . The Republican certainly contributed to such media coverage by calling the women liars and charging that the news media presented their claims \u201c with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever . \u201d\n\u201c All of these liars will be sued when the election is over , \u201d the New York billionaire said in Gettysburg .\nMr. Trump said the smears used against him underscore the corrupt power wielded by the political establishment , which he said poses an even greater threat to working Americans .\n\u201c If they can fight somebody like me with unlimited resources to fight back , just look at what they can do to you \u2014 your jobs , your security , your education , your health care , the violation of religious liberty , the theft of your Second Amendment , the loss of your factories , your homes and much more , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nAs was the case during his final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night , debates about issues took a backseat over the weekend . At the debate , his back-and-forth with Mrs. Clinton over gun rights , abortion , and the economy was overshadowed by his refusal to say he \u2019 ll accept the results of the Nov. 8 election .\nIn the case of his Saturday speech , headlines were dominated by his lawsuit threat , not his detailed policy prescriptions .\nTrump campaign officials also have struggled to fend off a growing narrative that says the race is all but over .
