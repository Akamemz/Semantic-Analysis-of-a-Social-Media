    "content": "Federal health officials rushed Friday to assure a frightened public that Ebola does not pose a serious threat in the U.S. , even as the first \u2014 and thus far only \u2014 diagnosis on American soil exposed potential flaws in border screening , treatment and disposal of contaminated items .\nAs Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan , who showed symptoms of the often-fatal disease shortly after arriving from Liberia , was in serious condition and being treated in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital , relatives in Dallas resisted a quarantine amid reports that cleanup specialists were balking at disinfecting their home .\nStill , Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , insists he 's confident Ebola can be contained in the U.S. , unlike in Africa where it has killed more than 3,300 since the current outbreak began late last year .\n\u201c I have no doubt we will control this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely , \u201d Frieden said .\nSo far , Duncan 's diagnosis is the only verified one in the U.S. A man who was isolated in a Hawaii hospital after showing symptoms consistent with Ebola has been cleared , although on Friday , a spokeswoman for Howard University in Washington said the university 's hospital has admiteed a patient who had been in Nigeria and showed possible symptoms .\nFrieden 's assurances came amid calls for better screening of U.S.-bound passengers from Ebola-affected nations and word that Duncan 's initial triage was bungled at the hospital .\nAt a Dallas apartment where Duncan stayed after arriving Sept. 20 , family members were legally quarantined Thursday after refusing to comply with Dallas health officials requests that they stay home . Doctors are taking the temperatures of four family members in the unit where Duncan was staying twice a day to monitor symptoms as part of the health surveillance efforts being led by CDC officials and local Dallas authorities .\nTexas health officials told reporters during a press conference Thursday that the family would be quarantined in their apartment unit for the next 20 days until the potential incubation period for Ebola is over .\nOn Thursday , a Springfield , Mo. , microbiologist and emergency trauma physician who runs a charity in Guatemala , appeared at Atlanta \u2019 s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport dressed in protective gear to protest what he called mismanagement of the crisis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\u201c If they \u2019 re not lying , they are grossly incompetent , \u201d said Dr. Gil Mobley , who cleared airport security wearing a mask , goggles , gloves , boots and a hooded white jumpsuit emblazoned on the back with the words , \u201c CDC is lying ! \u201d\nIn Duncan 's homeland , authorities vowed to prosecute him for allegedly lying on an airport screening form by answering \u201c no \u201d to questions about whether he had \u201c cared for an Ebola patient or touched the body of someone who had died in an area affected by Ebola . '' In truth , Duncan reportedly had helped carry a 19-year-old pregnant woman to a taxi to go to the hospital just five days before he boarded a U.S.-bound flight . The woman later died .\n\u201c There were no signs of any disease when the gentleman boarded the flight , \u201d said Dr. Tom Kenyon , director of the CDC \u2019 s Center for Global Health . \u201c This was not a failure of the screening process at the airport . \u201d\nBut the ease at which Duncan passed the screening , coupled with the fact that Ebola victims may not become symptomatic for weeks after exposure , raised questions about how best to keep the disease off American soil . Jessica Vaughn , a researcher affiliated with the nonprofit Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , said officials have the right to ban anyone from entering the U.S. if they pose a potential threat to public health or safety .\n\u201c Other countries are banning travellers from outbreak countries , and we should , too , \u201d Vaughn told The Washington Post . \u201c In the middle of a health crisis , the government should be setting up more robust screening protocols . \u201d\nMeanwhile , health officials in Dallas acknowledged that Duncan \u2019 s clothing and bedding were still in plastic bags and had not been removed , The Dallas Morning News reports . Officials were seemingly unsure how to delegate the removal of contaminated items from the apartment .\nAsked why Duncan 's items and clothing were still at the location , the county 's Health and Human Services director responded that it was n't his agency 's responsibility .\nThe items will soon be `` appropriately disposed of , '' a county judge said .\nHealth officials widened their search Thursday to 100 individuals possibly exposed to the disease \u2014 tracing contacts of the patient and medical staff who initially treated him . Also on Thursday , officials said three more young children potentially had contact with Duncan , bringing the number of kids being monitored to eight .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to break that risk down to high-risk , no-risk and low-risk , and that \u2019 s going to be the basis of our contact tracing , \u201d said David Daigle , associate director for communications , public health preparedness and response at the CDC .\nDaigle expressed concern about infection control at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital , where Duncan is currently in isolation , and said that a team was dispatched to conduct the same kind of contact tracing officials are doing in the local community .\nZachary Thompson , director of Dallas County Health and Human Services , tried to quell fears in the community of the virus spreading and stressed transparency during the investigation .\n\u201c A lot of the individuals that we come in contact with will not have any symptoms , they will not have any association other than the fact that someone said they were there , or they might have had contact , \u201d Thompson said . \u201c This is local public health surveillance at its best , in what we do day in and day out . \u201d\nPolice were stationed at the Ivy Apartment complex where the family lives Thursday to keep the peace and assist residents and health officials in the community during the investigation .\n\u201c We want to make sure we create a calm and safe environment for [ health officials ] to do their work \u2014 that \u2019 s our primary focus .
