    "content": "The U.S. , Iran and five world powers on Thursday reached a preliminary deal designed to contain Iran \u2019 s nuclear program , one that would restrict Iran \u2019 s ability to enrich uranium and subject it to international inspections , but which also would gradually remove harsh economic sanctions from the Islamic Republic .\nThe agreement , if it holds , could prove to be President Barack Obama \u2019 s biggest foreign policy achievement , a success stemming from his conviction that it \u2019 s worth engaging even longtime adversaries such as Tehran . But while the framework won praise for its surprising level of detail , it failed to quell sharp skepticism from many Republicans as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\n\u201c It is a good deal , \u201d Obama declared Thursday , calling it \u201c a historic understanding with Iran which , if implemented , will prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon .\n\u201c I am convinced that if this framework leads to a final deal , it will make our country and the world safer , \u201d Obama said in a appearance at the White House Rose Garden . The deal , unveiled in Lausanne , Switzerland , would \u201c cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon . \u201d\nObama struck a confident tone , directly engaging potential critics including Netanyahu and Republicans in Congress . Pointing to the possibility for military conflict should the talks ultimately fail , Obama said , \u201c I welcome a robust debate . \u201d\nNetanyahu , speaking several hours after the deal was announced , said \u201c The concessions offered to Iran in Lausanne would ensure a bad deal that would endanger Israel , the Middle East and the peace of the world . Now is the time for the international community to insist on a better deal . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , who has been on a trip to the Middle East , questioned elements of the deal related to sanctions relief . The Republican insisted : \u201c It would be naive to suggest the Iranian regime will not continue to use its nuclear program , and any economic relief , to further destabilize the region . \u201d\nObama said he saw three options : The first , the U.S. \u2019 current path of a negotiated agreement with Iran . Second , bombing Iran \u2019 s nuclear facilities , a move he warned would set its program back only \u201c by a few years. \u201d The third option , Obama said , was to \u201c pull out of negotiations \u2026 and hope for the best . \u201d\n\u201c Iran is not going to dismantle its program because we demand it do so , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s not how the world works . \u201d\nObama said he had already called Saudi Arabia \u2019 s King Salman before his Rose Garden speech . But Obama did not call Netanyahu until well after his remarks \u2014 during a flight to Louisville , Kentucky , aboard Air Force One . According to the White House , the president told Netanyahu the deal \u201c in no way diminishes our concerns with respect to Iran \u2019 s sponsorship of terrorism and threats towards Israel. \u201d Obama also directed his national security team to \u201c increase consultations \u201d with the Israeli government . The Israeli readout of the call said that Netanyahu stressed that the deal would threaten Israel \u2019 s existence .\nThe agreement itself was announced in Lausanne by European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif .\nWhat was laid out Thursday was essentially a broad a framework ; a more comprehensive , technical deal is expected by June 30 . Still , the result caught many close observers by surprise after reports from the shores of Lake Geneva suggested talks were heading toward a vague press statement of principles \u2014 or outright impasse .\n\u201c I was expecting either no agreement today or a much thinner one , \u201d said Richard N. Haass , president of the Council on Foreign Relations . \u201c It is more substantive and more comprehensive than many us thought would be the case . \u201d\nHaass specifically praised the extent of monitoring of the nuclear supply chain and concessions on the number of centrifuges . But given the amount of work to be done before June 30 , \u201c no one should be popping champagne today , \u201d Haass cautioned . \u201c For all we know , there will be backtracking . \u201d\n\u2014 Iran will dismantle two-thirds of its 19,000 installed centrifuges . Those devices , which spin uranium into material that can be used for a nuclear weapon , will be stored under International Atomic Energy Agency oversight . Tehran will be left with 6,104 centrifuges , lower than some reported offers by the U.S. , and 5,060 of those can be used to enrich uranium .\n\u2014 Iran can keep open an underground nuclear facility at Fordow , a controversial site because it was built in secret and only revealed by the U.S. in 2009 . Iran will not be required to close the facility but could use it only for research that does not include the enrichment of uranium .\n\u2014 Rigorous transparency and inspection measures to ensure that Iran doesn \u2019 t cheat on any deal . They include granting the IAEA intrusive access to Iran \u2019 s nuclear facilities and supply chain , including to its domestic uranium mines and mills . The inspections would continue even after many elements of the deal have expired in 2025 , including surveillance of Iran \u2019 s centrifuge rotors until 2035 . Iran has also agreed to some indefinite transparency measures .\n\u2014 In return for the limits on Iran \u2019 s program , the U.S. and EU will suspend sanctions after the IAEA has verified Iran \u2019 s compliance with the deal ; those sanctions can automatically \u201c snap back \u201d if Iran violates the agreement at any time . ( Obama can temporarily suspend sanctions passed by Congress , although only Congress can permanently repeal them . ) The United Nations will also lift its sanctions on Iran after it meets the deal \u2019 s requirements .\nSpeaking in Lausanne , Secretary of State John Kerry called the framework \u201c a critical milestone \u201d and \u201c a solid foundation for the good deal we are seeking . \u201d\nThe exact timing of sanctions relief , he noted , \u201c remains one of those issues that is going to be negotiated over the course of the next three months. \u201d In general , he said , \u201c Iran has the responsibility to get the breakout time to one year \u201d \u2014 meaning it has to prove to the satisfaction of international inspectors that it would take at least a year to develop a nuclear weapon , so there would be plenty of advance warning if Iran tried to do that . Once IAEA inspectors certify that Iran has met those conditions , Kerry said , sanctions will begin to be reduced .\nThe deal , key points of which were sent out to reporters by the White House , was unclear on some crucial questions that critics are sure to pounce on :\n\u2014 Although the agreement specifies that Iran will dramatically \u201c reduce \u201d its current stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 97 percent , from 10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms , details of the agreement provided by the Obama administration do not say how that will happen . U.S. officials are expected to require Iran to ship that material \u2014 which is more than halfway to the potency needed for a bomb \u2014 out of the country . But Iran has proposed to retain the material and simply dilute it to a form unsuitable for a nuclear weapon , although that dilution is reversible .\nKerry , however , said in Lausanne that negotiators have a resolution on what to do with Iran \u2019 s uranium : \u201c It has to be either diluted or sold on the international market , one of the two . \u2026 That is agreed upon at this point in time , \u201d he said .\n\u2014 Iran has refused to answer a list of IAEA questions about its suspected past research into nuclear weapons technology , like explosives that can detonate highly enriched uranium . The agreement does not specify how or when that will happen , saying only that \u201c Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address the IAEA \u2019 s concerns \u201d on the military research question . Mogherini said only that the nuclear agency \u201c will have enhanced access through agreed procedures , including to clarify past and present issues . \u201d\nOil-rich Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is for scientific , medical and other purposes , not for making weapons . On Thursday , Zarif said Iran has agreed to take steps to assure the world \u201c that our program is exclusively peaceful , that our program always has been and always will be exclusively peaceful. \u201d But , he added , Iran will not close any of its nuclear facilities \u2014 a condition it said would have been unacceptable . \u201c We have done significant work . We have made achievements . We have made progress , \u201d Zarif said .\nObama stressed in particular the inspection and verification aspects of the agreement .\n\u201c If Iran cheats , the world will know it . If we see anything suspicious , we will inspect it , \u201d Obama said . He said Iran will face \u201c more inspections than any other country in the world. \u201d And he said the relief from sanctions will be \u201c phased \u201d as long as Iran proves it is complying with the terms of an agreement .\n\u201c If there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians , \u201d he said , \u201c there will be no deal . \u201d\nKerry contended that the deal has no sunset date . In reality , most of its provisions \u2014 how many centrifuges Iran can run , for instance \u2014 will expire after a decade . But Iran has agreed to a special arrangement with the IAEA known as the Additional Protocol , which grants the international agency \u2019 s inspectors enhanced information about and access to the country \u2019 s nuclear activities and infrastructure . The Additional Protocol has no time limit .\nThe deal \u2019 s announcement came after a final round of negotiations in Lausanne , following a grueling marathon session that kept officials talking until 6 a.m. Thursday \u2014 and two days after a self-imposed deadline to reach a political agreement . Aside from the U.S. and Iran , countries participating include Germany , France , Britain , Russia and China .\nEarlier this week , the Obama administration started signaling its impatience with the Iranians , with White House press secretary Josh Earnest warning Wednesday that the negotiations would not be \u201c open-ended. \u201d The Iranians also dug in , repeatedly pointing to sanctions relief as a major concern .\nThe agreement could end up at the mercy of U.S. domestic politics , and it was fast fodder for Republicans hoping to succeed Obama in the White House .\n\u201c This attempt to spin diplomatic failure as a success is just the latest example of this administration \u2019 s farcical approach to Iran , \u201d Florida Sen.
