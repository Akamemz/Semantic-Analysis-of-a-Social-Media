Since the 2013 address when Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage , 17 states and six major cities have taken action , including Los Angeles last week .\nObama 's state-and-local strategy may be unprecedented in its scope and ambition .

We think we can have a more substantial impact if we collaborate , '' said Valerie Jarrett , the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs .\n`` I think the president has always had the perspective that change always happens from the ground up , and our state and local officials are oftentimes more influenced by the will of the American people than the politics in Washington would seem to indicate , '' Jarrett said in an interview .\nObama has no formal authority over state and local lawmakers , so his persuasion is a form of soft power \u2014 the `` phone '' part of what Obama has described as a `` pen-and-phone '' strategy to take action in the absence of congressional cooperation .\nHe 's found fertile ground in Democratic-run cities such as Seattle , where Mayor Ed Murray helped push for a minimum wage and paid leave laws that have gone into effect since April .\n`` President Obama recognizes that good ideas are being incubated at the local level , and those are ideas that are going to go to scale nationally , '' Murray said . That recognition can go a long way in a city such as Seattle , which often does n't get the national attention East Coast cities do . `` The president of the United States recognizing us only helps us .

Jon Russell is a councilman in Culpeper , Va. , and the director of the American City County Exchange , a year-old initiative of the small-government American Legislative Exchange Council .\nRussell said states \u2014 not cities , not Congress and not the president \u2014 should be the primary regulator of labor conditions . Obama , he said , is `` hop-skipping over the states . ''\n`` With the number of states that have now turned to the opposite political party , he does n't have the allies there that he used to , '' Russell said . `` To work with the urban areas to push his agenda is not surprising . It 's the only allies he really has . ''\nThe strategy has been more effective on some policies than others . Since last September , more than 200 mayors have signed on to the My Brother 's Keeper initiative , a commitment to help boys and young men of color . But since Obama called for states to offer free community college in January , only a handful have moved in that direction .\nThe state-and-local strategy effort has been particularly effective on paid leave policies , which Obama championed in his State of the Union Address this year . `` Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave \u2014 43 million . Think about that , '' Obama said . `` So I 'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own . ''\nThat pledge came with a $ 1 million budget from the Department of Labor to help fund feasibility studies for state and local governments , which will begin to be awarded this summer .\nObama dispatched Jarrett and Labor Secretary Tom Perez on a `` Lead on Leave '' tour of cities that have adopted paid leave policies . Jarrett went to Philadelphia and Chicago ; Perez has been to Portland , Ore. , Pawtucket , R.I. , St. Petersburg , Fla. , and Seattle .\nTuesday , Perez will be in Minneapolis , which just adopted a paid leave policy for city employees this month .\nPerez said it 's a mistake to view the state-and-local strategy as separate from a larger effort . `` Our strategy is an all-of-the-above-and-then-some strategy , '' he said .\nHe said Obama will continue to use executive orders , as he did when he increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $ 10.10 an hour .\n`` We want Congress to act , and I 'm confident that it 's a when question , not an if question . But we 're also not going to wait around for Congress to act , '' Perez said .\nAlthough focusing on city councils may seem small compared with the sweeping congressional legislation early in Obama 's presidency , state minimum wage laws will raise the pay of more than 7 million people by 2017 . ( That number , which comes from the White House Council of Economic Advisers , includes people making just above minimum wage who were helped indirectly because their wages are increased accordingly . )\nSan Francisco passed the first paid sick time law in the nation in 2006 , requiring all employers to grant one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked .
