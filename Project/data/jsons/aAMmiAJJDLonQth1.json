Here 's a step-by-step look at what happens inside the body when it takes hold .\nAccording to the CDC , the virus can spread person-to-person within 6 feet through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes .\nIt \u2019 s also possible for the virus to remain on a surface or object , be transferred by touch and enter the body through the mouth , nose or eyes .\nDr. Martin S. Hirsch , senior physician in the Infectious Diseases Services at Massachusetts General Hospital , said there \u2019 s still a lot to learn but experts suspect the virus may act similarly to SARS-CoV from 13 years ago .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a respiratory virus and thus it enters through the respiratory tract , we think primarily through the nose , \u201d he said . \u201c But it might be able to get in through the eyes and mouth because that \u2019 s how other respiratory viruses behave . \u201d\nWhen the virus enters the body , it begins to attack .\nIt can take two to 14 days for a person to develop symptoms after initial exposure to the virus , Hirsch said . The average is about five days .\nOnce inside the body , it begins infecting epithelial cells in the lining of the lung .

A case of `` mild '' COVID-19 includes a fever and cough more severe than the seasonal flu but does not require hospitalization .\nThose milder cases are because the body \u2019 s immune response is able to contain the virus in the upper respiratory tract , Hirsch says . Younger patients have a more vigorous immune response compared to older patients .\nThe 13.8 % of severe cases and 6.1 % critical cases are due to the virus trekking down the windpipe and entering the lower respiratory tract , where it seems to prefer growing .\nAs the virus continues to replicate and journeys further down the windpipe and into the lung , it can cause more respiratory problems like bronchitis and pneumonia , according to Dr. Raphael Viscidi , infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine .\nPneumonia is characterized by shortness of breath combined with a cough and affects tiny air sacs in the lungs , called alveoli , Viscidi said .
