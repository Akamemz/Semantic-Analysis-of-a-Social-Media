    "content": "Rep. John Ratcliffe , a Trump loyalist without intelligence experience nominated by the U.S. president to become the nation \u2019 s top intelligence chief , faced a deeply divided panel of U.S. senators on Tuesday . Over the course of his Senate confirmation hearing , Democratic lawmakers questioned his fitness for the post in the wake of his fiery support for President Donald Trump during the impeachment trial and the president \u2019 s own chronic misrepresentation of facts that has put him at odds with the U.S. intelligence community in the past .\nRatcliffe , a Republican from Texas who at one point was considered unqualified for the job by some fellow Republicans as well as Democrats , sought to portray himself as a director of national intelligence who would leave politics at the door to deliver \u201c unvarnished \u201d truth to the president .\nBut some critics , wary of his lack of experience in the intelligence community , are worried that he \u2019 ll put political loyalty ahead of his responsibilities to deliver intelligence assessments to the president . Ratcliffe withdrew himself from consideration for the post in August 2019 , after facing criticism that he lacked the right qualifications and embellished his resume . Trump resubmitted his nomination in February .\n\u201c I think he is the most unqualified person ever formally nominated to this position , \u201d said Larry Pfeiffer , who spent 32 years in the U.S. intelligence community and served as chief of staff to CIA Director Michael Hayden .\nRatcliffe , if confirmed , would take the helm of the U.S. intelligence community as it faces unprecedented levels of political pressure from the president and his allies . His rocky path to the nomination came in the wake of a hyperpartisan impeachment investigation started by a whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official , as well as years of simmering discord between Trump and other senior officials inside the intelligence community . Those tensions led to the firing or forced resignation of key senior intelligence officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) , leaving the office without a single Senate-confirmed official .\nRatcliffe became one of Trump \u2019 s fiercest defenders during the impeachment inquiry , accusing Democrats of helping write the whistleblower complaint when there was no evidence they had done so and misrepresenting other facts and statements from witnesses throughout the Democratic-led investigation in the House .\nVeteran intelligence officials have voiced concerns over the health of the ODNI under Richard Grenell , Trump \u2019 s acting intelligence chief . Grenell , a political loyalist with no prior experience in intelligence , has overseen a hiring freeze and reorganization of the office and engaged in high-profile Twitter spats with political rivals that former intelligence officials view as unbecoming of the office .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s best if the DNI has actually served in an intelligence position , preferably as an Agency director , as a minimum , \u201d said James Clapper , who served as director of national intelligence for nearly seven years .\nRatcliffe sought to allay concerns about his nomination during the hearing , held in a sparse hearing room on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to adhere to social distancing measures during the coronavirus pandemic .

John Cornyn , who introduced Ratcliffe at the hearing .\nIf the senators fail to give their seal of approval to Ratcliffe , a law on government vacancies stipulates that the acting director of national intelligence can remain in the position for another seven months , effectively forcing lawmakers to choose between Ratcliffe and Grenell , who also has no previous intelligence experience .\nSenators in the hearing also grilled Ratcliffe on his record during the impeachment investigation , intelligence on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic , foreign interference in the 2020 elections , and how he would protect the intelligence community and whistleblowers from political pressures .\nUnder questioning from Democratic Sen.
