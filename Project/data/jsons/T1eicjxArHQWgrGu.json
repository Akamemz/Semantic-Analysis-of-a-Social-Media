    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has not spared any aspect of American society , including the criminal justice system . Eight of the 10 biggest clusters of COVID-19 cases currently are in jails and prisons . The Cook County jail in Illinois , for example , has confirmed nearly 1,000 cases . In Ohio , more than 25 percent of the 16,000 statewide cases are in prisons , which includes the nearly 2,200 confirmed cases in the Marion Correctional Institution alone . As of April 30 , 2020 , 1,692 individuals in federal custody and 349 Bureau of Prisons staff have tested positive for COVID-19 , and there have been 33 deaths among incarcerated people .\nThis troubling trend does not come as much of a surprise . Many public health experts and criminal justice advocates have pointed to the heightened risk of the novel coronavirus \u2019 s rampant spread in jails and prisons given the confined nature of those facilities and how they are operated . Physical distancing in corrections facilities is nearly impossible , especially due to overcrowding and confined quarters , and infirmaries do not have adequate resources . What \u2019 s more , individuals in prisons may be at higher risk for health complications due to the prevalence of chronic illnesses and the vulnerability of the aging prison population .\nThe spread of the coronavirus also is not limited to the inside of the walls of a prison or jail . Corrections officers and staff have regular interactions with those they are charged with supervising , and exposure to the virus has already affected their families and surrounding communities . Moreover , jail populations are continually revolving because they include people who are awaiting trial or have been sentenced to a relatively short term . And nearly 95 percent of those in prisons eventually return to their communities after serving their sentence .\nIn order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in prisons and jail\u2014and subsequently in communities\u2014state and local governments and their federal counterpart must significantly and safely reduce their corrections populations . They can do so through a variety of authorities\u2014including early parole and expanded use of home confinement\u2014but an overlooked power that they should use more aggressively is commutations . Each governor as well as the president of the United States has the power to grant commutations that shorten the sentence of a person incarcerated within their jurisdiction , allowing them to be released early . This is a ready-made authority for situations such as the current pandemic where public health and safety dictate the need to significantly reduce corrections populations . Yet , public officials\u2014and especially the president of the United States\u2014are not using this tool in significant enough ways .\nCommutations and other forms of clemency such as pardons have always been an important tool for remedying individual instances of injustice , such as cases of wrongful convictions or sentences that outweigh the severity of an offense . However , then-President Barack Obama , who issued 1,715 commutations over the course of his presidency , explained how commutations can also be used for large-scale changes :\nBy shifting the narrative to the way clemency can be used to correct injustices in the system \u2014 and reminding people of the value of second chances \u2014 I worked to reinvigorate the clemency power and to set a precedent that will make it easier for future Presidents , governors , and other public officials to use it for good .\nThe process of granting commutations is not necessarily free of bureaucracy . In most jurisdictions , the governor grants a commutation after review by relevant state agencies and officials . Governors in some states , such as Alabama , Connecticut , and Louisiana , delegate to or share power with a clemency board . At the federal level , the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has historically been heavily involved with vetting who is eligible for commutations\u2014a process that has come under heavy criticism from advocates , researchers , and practitioners .\nNevertheless , the ultimate power to grant commutations resides with the president and the governors , and those bureaucratic hurdles can be streamlined and possibly eliminated altogether given current circumstances and the public support for lowering jail and prison populations in response to the pandemic . For example , a recent Data for Progress poll showed that 66 percent of likely voters , including 59 percent of those who identify themselves as \u201c very conservative , \u201d agreed that \u201c elected officials should be considering measures to reduce overcrowding in prisons and jails as a response to coronavirus . \u201d\nThe Trump administration has lagged behind governors \u2019 modest efforts to commute sentences\nSeveral governors have recognized the need to utilize the power of commutations . Washington Gov . Jay Inslee ( D ) issued an emergency commutation that will allow for the release of more than 1,000 individuals . Oklahoma Gov . Kevin Stitt ( R ) , who notably granted commutations and pardons to more than 1,000 people in his first year in office prior to the pandemic , commuted the sentences of more than 450 additional people . And Gov . Andy Beshear of Kentucky ( D ) issued commutations in early April for 186 individuals who were at high risk for serious complications or death if they contracted COVID-19 ; he followed that up by granting an additional 352 commutations later that month . These are significant starts , but more needs to be done to address this surging aspect of the pandemic\u2014especially considering there are more than 2.2 million people in America \u2019 s jails and prisons .\nAt the federal level , President Donald Trump has not granted a single commutation in the last two months to any of the more than 170,000 people incarcerated in the federal Bureau of Prisons . This is unsurprising , since he granted a total of only 10 commutations during the more than three years he has been in office . Trump did make a splashy announcement in February that he was assembling a White House task force to ramp up the number of people to whom he would grant commutations and pardons .
