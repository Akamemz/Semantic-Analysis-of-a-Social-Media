    "content": "Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Marco Rubio on Saturday won the endorsement of The Des Moines Register , the most prominent daily newspaper in Iowa , with just over a week until voters caucus on Feb. 1 and begin the process of selecting their parties \u2019 presidential nominees .\nIn the dual editorials , the paper said Democratic voters had `` one outstanding candidate deserving of their support , '' citing Clinton 's `` depth '' of `` knowledge and experience '' and her ability to work across party lines as a New York senator , while stating that the `` whip smart '' Rubio could `` chart a new direction '' for the GOP .\nThe paper \u2019 s editorial board acknowledged that Clinton is \u201c not a perfect candidate , \u201d detailing her email furor and changing stances on gay marriage and immigration , but it argued she is much more qualified than both Bernie Sanders and Martin O \u2019 Malley . Of Rubio , the paper argued that he still faces questions over his experience and ability to unite the party but that he could offer , above other GOP contenders , \u201c an uplifting message \u2018 of a new American century . \u2019 \u201d\nBoth campaigns quickly blasted out the respective editorials in emails to their supporters . But strategists and observers have raised questions about whether the paper \u2019 s approval can do much to influence voters \u2014 and in some cases could even be counterproductive .\nThe Register has been endorsing candidates ahead of Iowa 's presidential caucuses since 1988 , but this cycle \u2019 s blessings came amid an upside-down political atmosphere in which once-vaunted traditions have become unwelcome reminders of insiderdom .\nThe two Republican candidates likeliest to win the caucuses \u2014 Donald Trump and Ted Cruz \u2014 did n't even bother to court the paper 's endorsement . And it 's unclear whether they would \u2019 ve have wanted it anyway . Republican strategists and political observers predicted that unlike in previous years , a Register endorsement is an instant talking point for rivals , proof that the winners are aligned with a mainstream media outlet 's moderate-to-liberal lean .\n`` The Register \u2019 s endorsement is like being endorsed by The Washington Post or NY Times , if you \u2019 re a conservative , '' argued former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele . `` For Trump and Cruz it will give them a chance to sound off \u2014 to diminish any potential positive impact the endorsement could have \u2014 against the 'establishment ' endorsing one of their own . In short , it \u2019 s like a car accident : 'Move along , nothing to see here . ' ''\nDavid Yepsen , who covered politics for the Register for 34 years , also predicted that the Republican endorsement could backfire .\n`` I think it will become a point to needle , '' said Yepsen . `` 'See , we told you he was too liberal . ' ''\nThe biggest benefit from an endorsement would likely occur outside of Iowa , argued one veteran Iowa Republican strategist . For Rubio \u2014 who is seeking to run as an establishment-oriented alternative to Trump or Cruz \u2014 the endorsement could signal to voters in New Hampshire and more moderate enclaves that establishment Republicans are coalescing behind him .\nThe endorsement enables him to say ' I \u2019 m the establishment pick , ' and yeah , that \u2019 s going to be really valuable , '' the strategist said . `` That campaign is going to try to use it to say , \u2018 Look at me , East Coasters , this is the beginning of the meshing of the establishment behind me . \u2019 ''\nThe Democratic endorsement , Yepsen noted , may be more influential since the paper 's left-leaning editorial board tends to connect better with Democrats . The Register , he added , would have been hard-pressed to ditch Clinton , whom it backed over then-Sen. Barack Obama in late 2007 . The paper that year described her `` readiness '' to lead the country . `` We believe as president she 'll do what she 's always done in her life : Throw herself into the job and work hard , '' the board wrote . `` We believe Hillary Rodham Clinton can do great things for our country . '' ( If Sanders wins , it probably turns this story upside-down , since that would be a big surprise . )\nClinton won the endorsement , Yepsen noted , even though the paper 's editorial board has almost entirely turned over since her last campaign .\nThe Register 's Saturday endorsements were its 10th and 11th since it first backed Democrat Paul Simon in 1988 .
