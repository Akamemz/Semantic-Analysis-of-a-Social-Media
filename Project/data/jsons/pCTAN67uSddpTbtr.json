We 've solved a lot of problems and we 're in the process of solving a lot of problems , '' Trump said .\n`` She told me probably six months ago , 'You know maybe at end of the year -- at the end of the two year period -- but by the end of the year I want to take a little time off , I want to take a break , ' '' he added .\nHowever , a source familiar with the situation told CNN that Haley notified Trump about her decision last week and did not tell Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or White House national security adviser John Bolton .\nBoth Bolton and Pompeo were surprised by the announcement , a source familiar told CNN .\nOfficials inside the White House , who had little indication Haley was resigning on Tuesday , are questioning her timing .\nWhile Trump said she told him six months ago she wanted time off , there are questions among senior administration aides about why Haley chose this moment -- four weeks before midterms , and right after a bruising political battle involving gender -- to take her leave .\nOne official says there was little coordination on the announcement and sources tell CNN that almost all senior administration officials found themselves caught off guard by the announcement .\nStill , Trump lavished praise on Haley during the Oval Office event , saying she has `` been very special to me '' and calling her `` somebody that gets it . ''\nThe President also said Haley could have her `` pick '' of administration posts if she ever decides she wants to rejoin his administration .\n`` We 're all happy for you in one way , but we hate to lose -- hopefully you 'll be coming back at some point but in a different capacity . You can have your pick , '' Trump said as Haley smiled broadly .\nYet , in the wake of her resignation , two sources familiar with Haley 's relationship with Trump told CNN that she had lost clout with the President in recent months .\nWhen Rex Tillerson was still secretary of state , Trump sought out Haley 's advice often and she was regularly seen in the Oval Office .

I 've heard Ivanka . How good would Ivanka be ? '' Trump said . `` I think Ivanka would be incredible but it does n't mean I 'd pick her . Because I 'd be accused of nepotism even though I 'm not sure there 's anybody more competent in the world . ''\nHe then said his daughter would be `` dynamite '' as UN ambassador .\nSoon after the President 's remarks , Ivanka Trump took to Twitter to rule herself out of the running :\n`` It is an honor to serve in the White House alongside so many great colleagues and I know that the President will nominate a formidable replacement for Ambassador Haley . That replacement will not be me .
