Ron Johnson told reporters in Ferguson early Tuesday that 31 people had been arrested during a night of unrest that followed a day of largely peaceful protest . As Johnson spoke , two handguns and a Molotov cocktail that he said had been confiscated during the night by authorities lay on a table in front of him .\nThe majority-black town of approximately 21,000 has been roiled by unrest since the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown , who was fatally shot by a white police officer following a confrontation of some kind on the afternoon of August 9 . Local authorities have fired tear gas and smoke canisters on an almost daily basis at protesters upset with the response to the shootings by Ferguson Police .\nA visibly angry Johnson said that officers had come under heavy gunfire from protesters and at least two people had been shot . Johnson said he did not know the condition of the shooting victims . Four officers had been injured when they were struck by rocks or bottles , though Johnson claimed that police had not fired a single shot .\nCiting what he called a `` dangerous dynamic in the night , '' Johnson requested that protests take place during the daylight hours , so that officers could effectively isolate any troublemakers . However , Johnson said that his forces could not make protesters leave the streets after sunset if they did not want to .\n`` This nation is watching each and every one of us , '' said Johnson . `` I am not going to let the criminals that have come here from across this country , or live in this neighborhood , define this community . '' Johnson added that some of those who had been arrested overnight had come from as far afield as New York and California . The trooper also directed his wrath at the assembled media , saying that they had put themselves and officers in danger by failing to clear areas when asked before imploring them to `` not glamorize the acts of criminals . ''\n`` We do not want to lose another life in this community , '' Johnson added .\nShortly before midnight local time , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that police fired tear gas at a group of protesters who had reportedly defied orders to leave the parking lot of a burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that has been near the center of demonstrations over the past eight day . St. Louis County Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters that shots had been fired in the area and media members were told to go to a designated area about a quarter of a mile away .\nLate Monday , reporters estimated that the number of protesters had dropped to around 100 , far fewer than the number of media members who were covering them .\nA photographer for the Getty photo agency was arrested while covering the demonstrations and later released . Two German reporters were arrested and detained for three hours .
