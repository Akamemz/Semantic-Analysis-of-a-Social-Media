    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : On Thursday afternoon , Donald Trump held his first solo press conference as president . Trump began by announcing he had nominated Alexander Acosta to be labor secretary nominee , but then Trump soon began an extended attack on the media , accusing CNN and other outlets of peddling fake news . The press conference went on for 77 minutes . Here are some of the excerpts of what happened .\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : The press has become so dishonest that if we don \u2019 t talk about it , we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people . Tremendous disservice . We have to talk about it . We have to find out what \u2019 s going on , because the press , honestly , is out of control . The level of dishonesty is out of control . \u2026\nAs you know , our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy . To be honest , I inherited a mess . It \u2019 s a mess , at home and abroad . A mess . \u2026\nI turn on the TV , open the newspapers , and I see stories of chaos . Chaos . Yet it is the exact opposite . This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine , despite the fact that I can \u2019 t get my Cabinet approved . \u2026\nPETER ALEXANDER : Mr. President , you said today that you had the biggest electoral margin since Ronald Reagan , with 304 , 306 electoral votes . In fact , President Obama got 365 in 2008 .\nPETER ALEXANDER : And George H.W . Bush , 426 , when he won as president . So , why should Americans trust you ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , no , I was told\u2014I was given that information . I don \u2019 t know . I was just given it . We had a very , very big margin .\nPETER ALEXANDER : I guess my question is : Why should Americans trust you when you accuse the information they receive of being fake , when you \u2019 re providing information that \u2019 s not accurate ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , I don \u2019 t know . I was given that information . I was given\u2014I \u2019 ve\u2014actually , I \u2019 ve seen that information around . But it was a very substantial victory . Do you agree with that ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : OK , thank you . That \u2019 s a good answer .\nJOHN ROBERTS : What will you do on the leaks ? You have said twice today\u2014\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Yes , we \u2019 re looking at them very , very , very seriously . I \u2019 ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies , and we \u2019 re\u2014I \u2019 ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks . Those are criminal leaks .\nJONATHAN KARL : On the leaks , is it fake news , or are these real leaks ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , the leaks are real . You \u2019 re the one that wrote about them and reported them . I mean , the leaks are real . You know what they said . You saw it . And the leaks are absolutely real . The news is fake , because so much of the news is fake . \u2026\nI can handle a bad story better than anybody , as long as it \u2019 s true . And , you know , over a course of time , I \u2019 ll make mistakes , and you \u2019 ll write badly , and I \u2019 m OK with that . But I \u2019 m not OK when it is fake . I mean , I watch CNN . It \u2019 s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred .\nKRISTEN WELKER : Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador\u2014\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Excuse me . No , I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence . Very simple . Mike was doing his job . He was calling countries and his counterparts . So it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it . I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn \u2019 t doing it . I didn \u2019 t direct him . But I would have directed him , because that \u2019 s his job .\nJIM ACOSTA : You said that the leaks are real , but the news is fake . I guess I don \u2019 t understand . It seems that there \u2019 s a disconnect there . If the information coming from those leaks is real , then how can the stories be fake ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , the reporting is fake . Look , look\u2014\nJIM ACOSTA : And if I may ask\u2014I just want to ask one other question .\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Jim , you know what it is ? Here \u2019 s the thing . The public isn \u2019 t\u2014you know , they read newspapers . They see television . They watch . They don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s true or false , because they \u2019 re not involved . I \u2019 m involved . I \u2019 ve been involved with this stuff all my life . But I \u2019 m involved . So I know when you \u2019 re telling the truth or when you \u2019 re not . I just see many , many untruthful things . And I \u2019 ll tell you what else I see . I see tone . You know the word \u201c tone. \u201d The tone is such hatred . I \u2019 m really not a bad person , by the way . No , but the tone is such\u2014I do get good ratings . You have to admit that . The tone is such hatred . \u2026\nI certainly didn \u2019 t win by people listening to you people . That \u2019 s for sure . But I am having a good time . Tomorrow they will say , \u201c Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. \u201d I \u2019 m not ranting and raving . I \u2019 m just telling you , you know , you \u2019 re dishonest people . But\u2014but I \u2019 m not ranting and raving . I love this . I \u2019 m having a good time doing it . But tomorrow the headlines are going to be \u201c Donald Trump rants and raves. \u201d I \u2019 m not ranting and raving . \u2026\nThe whole Russian thing , that \u2019 s a ruse . That \u2019 s a ruse . And , by the way , it would be great if we could get along with Russia , just so you understand that . Now , tomorrow you \u2019 ll say , \u201c Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia . This is terrible. \u201d It \u2019 s not terrible . It \u2019 s good . \u2026\nJON SOPEL : On the travel ban , would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government\u2014\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Let me tell you about the travel\u2014\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Wait , wait , wait .

We had a court that \u2019 s been overturned\u2014again , may be wrong , but I think it \u2019 s 80 percent of the time . A lot . We had a bad decision . We \u2019 re going to keep going with that decision . We \u2019 re going to put in a new\u2014a new executive order next week sometime . \u2026\nREPORTER : Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election ?\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , I told you , General Flynn , obviously , was dealing , so that \u2019 s one person .

Nobody that I know of .\nREPORTER : So you \u2019 re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election .\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Look , look , look . How many times do I have to answer this question ?\nREPORTER : Can you just say yes or no on it ?\nAre you a friendly reporter ? Watch how friendly he is . Wait , wait . Watch how friendly he is . Go ahead .\nJAKE TURX : What we are concerned about , and what we haven \u2019 t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it . There has been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks . There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to\u2014\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You see , he said he was going to ask a very simple , easy question .
