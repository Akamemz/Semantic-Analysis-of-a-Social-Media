    "content": "The Republican nominee 's campaign might be unprecedented , but a key element of his stump schtick is rooted in a rhetorical device pioneered by the Ancient Greeks .\nFor campaign watchers in 2016 , the trope has become so familiar it typically slides by without notice . It is most commonly known among linguists as `` paralipsis '' ( `` to leave to the side '' ) , a tool employed by the great Roman debater Cicero and Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift that allows a speaker to effectively say two things at once .\nThe pattern has played out repeatedly over the past 15 months of campaigning : Trump tells you he wo n't say something negative about a rival , and in so promising , does it anyway . He 's used the device in talking about Bill and Hillary Clinton , a former Miss Universe , and past primary opponents including Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson , among others .\nMore than 80 million people heard it Monday night , in the closing minutes of Trump 's first face-off with Hillary Clinton , when he told viewers that , despite plans to level an `` extremely rough '' charge against Clinton and her family , `` I said to myself , I ca n't do it . I just ca n't do it . It 's inappropriate . ''\nA few minutes later , Trump turned it up a notch .\n`` I 'm very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton , '' he told CNN 's Dana Bash in the spin room as he raised the infidelity issue he 'd skirted on stage , `` because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton , and I just did n't want to say what I was going to say . ''\nAnd there it was : Trump had not discussed the former president 's extramarital affairs , except , of course , that he was quite obviously standing there , discussing the former president 's extramarital affairs .\n`` Donald Trump uses paralipsis , repeatedly , and he does it in combination with another rhetorical figure , which is called argumentum ad baculum -- or threats of force , '' Dr. Jennifer Mercieca , an expert on political discourse at Texas A & M University , told CNN . `` He implied that there was something that he was going to say , that he wanted to say , about Bill Clinton and infidelity , but that he was n't . ''\n`` It was a threat , '' she said , `` be nice to me or I 'm going bring out these terrible things . And I think that 's what we 've seen from the surrogates , and from him , since the debates , so it keeps being lorded over the Clinton campaign 's head -- that this thing is coming . ''\nThe device may be thousands of years old , but Trump has employed it in new and , at least in the modern American context , surprising ways .\n`` I 've never seen anyone in public life use paralipsis the way he does , '' Mercieca said . `` It 's a clearly demagogic move . It allows him to recirculate information without being held accountable for it . ''\nSuch was the purpose during Trump 's Wednesday night interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News , which followed more than a day of being questioned and criticized for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado .\n`` So a lot of things are coming out about her , '' he said . `` I 'm not going to say anything . ''\nPressed to comment on whether Clinton had taken a `` cheap shot '' by bringing up Machado during the debate , Trump started in on the former beauty queen after vowing he would n't .\n`` A lot of things are coming out that I was n't aware of , like they say that she threatened the life of a judge and got involved in all sorts of problems , '' he said .\nDuring an August 2015 rally in New Hampshire , when Fiorina was enjoying a brief uptick in the GOP primary race , Trump observed that she had been `` a little nasty '' to him .\n`` So I promised that I would n't say , so I said it to myself , I promised I would n't say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground , '' he said to hoots from supporters . `` I said I will not say it -- that her stock value tanked .
