    "content": "Rep. Steve Israel ( D-NY ) , chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , has orders for all those House Democrats who had considered attending the convention in Charlotte this fall : swim away ! Yes , rather than go to the DNC in a big display of party unity , the guy tasked with getting Democrats elected to the House wants them to avoid it .\n`` If they want to win an election , they need to be in their districts , '' New York congressman Steve Israel , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , told the Reuters Washington Summit on Tuesday . Israel emphasized that Democratic President Barack Obama 's poll ratings - which have hovered around 50 percent - have little to do with his stance . `` I do n't care if the president was at 122 percent favorability right now , '' he said . `` I think ( candidates ) should be in their districts , '' rather than spend time at the convention , which will be in Charlotte , North Carolina , September 3-6 . `` A trip to Charlotte may be interesting , '' Israel said , `` but why leave your districts ? ''\nOf course , this is ONLY because they need to stay in their districts to campaign , and has nothing to do with Obama 's tanking popularity . Or the fact that the Dems ' chances of reclaiming House majority status are tenuous at best . Or that association with the current president would only further jeopardize that effort . No , of course not !\nSen. Claire McCaskill -- one of Obama 's most ardent supporters in 2008 -- is skipping , although she denies it has anything to do with distancing herself from the president . Joe Manchin , too , preemptively announced his abstention , and a handful of other Democratic lawmakers have already declined to join in the fun .\nNow , the convention lasts for three days . How preposterous that no one running for office could spare the time to make an appearance , and show support for the president . Typically , this would be their opportunity to ride his coattails , and get a little boost from the media exposure and donor networking that will abound .\nUnless , of course , these lawmakers felt that association with him would tarnish their images . So despite what Rep. Israel says , it sure does look like the Democrats are cutting their losses : perhaps they 'll lose the presidency , but if they play it safe , maybe they can keep a few seats in Congress .",
