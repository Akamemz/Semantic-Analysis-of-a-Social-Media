General Assembly on Thursday marked Mr. Netanyahu 's latest public challenge to President Barack Obama to more aggressively confront Tehran .\nBut Mr. Netanyahu also implied that Israel would n't consider attacking Iran at least until the spring . By then , he argued , Iran will have amassed enough medium-enriched uranium to convert into fuel for a nuclear bomb in a matter of weeks or months .\nStanding before world leaders , the Israeli leader held a drawing of a round bomb with a lighted fuse and , with a thick red marker , drew a line he said Iran should n't be permitted to cross .\n`` I believe that , faced with a clear red line , Iran will back down , '' Mr. Netanyahu said .\nThe Israeli leader 's comments damped fears among some Western and Arab officials that Israel might strike Iran 's nuclear facilities before the U.S. presidential election in November . These officials said they believed that any possible military action has been put off until at least next year .\n`` I do n't believe any longer that we will see an attack before November , '' said a senior Arab official . `` This was n't the case a few weeks ago . ''\nThe comments were seen similarly by Israeli analysts . `` The pressure was focused on the possibility that Israel might attack before the elections , '' said Shlomo Brom , a fellow at Tel Aviv University 's Institute for National Security Studies and a former brigadier general in the Israeli military . `` Now it seems like it 's off the table . ''\nTehran denies it is trying to build nuclear weapons , and late Thursday called Mr. Netanyahu 's accusations `` entirely baseless . ''\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , speaking in New York this week , said he did n't take Israeli threats seriously\u2014and said any strike on his country would be seen as a joint Israeli-U.S. operation .\n`` The Islamic Republic of Iran is strong enough to defend itself and reserves its full right to retaliate with full force against any attack , '' Tehran 's mission to the U.N. said in a statement Thursday night .\nMr. Netanyahu in recent months has repeatedly threatened military strikes against Iran , while asking Mr. Obama to lay down his own red line , including during a phone conversation earlier this month , according to U.S. officials .\nMr. Obama and his aides have rebuffed the Israeli leader 's demands , saying such a pronouncement could constrict Washington 's ability to use diplomacy to contain Iran 's nuclear threat . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met on Thursday with representatives of the global powers seeking to contain Iran 's nuclear program through talks with Tehran , which U.S. officials said they expected would resume in the coming months .\nMrs. Clinton met one-on-one with Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday evening for 75 minutes to discuss Iran . They agreed to continue `` close consultation '' on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , a senior State Department official said .\nWhite House officials on Thursday played down any differences between Messrs. Obama and Netanyahu . `` As the prime minister said , the United States and Israel share the goal of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon , '' said U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor .\nIsrael 's prime minister sought and failed to secure a meeting with Mr. Obama in New York this week .

Should he make such a decision , according to U.S. intelligence , it still could take a year to 18 months for Iran to develop a crude nuclear bomb , a longer timeline than that outlined by Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday .\nThe Obama administration also is confident that sanctions are significantly weakening Iran 's economy . Treasury officials say the sanctions are costing Tehran $ 15 billion a quarter in lost oil revenue and that Iran 's energy sales have dropped by a million barrels a day .\nMr. Netanyahu said on Thursday that sanctions are having an impact , but stressed that he did n't believe sanctions alone would be enough to make Iran give up its nuclear program\u2014implying the country 's rulers wo n't make rational decisions .\nIran could produce enough of 20 % -enriched uranium by next spring or early summer , Mr. Netanyahu estimated , adding it would be just `` a few months , possibly a few weeks '' before it could develop a crude nuclear device .\nThe U.N. 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , estimated last month Iran had amassed 190 kilograms of uranium enriched to 20 % purity . Of this , 71 kilograms have been converted into fuel rods for Iran 's research reactor in Tehran , according to the IAEA .\nNuclear experts believe Iran would need 250 kilograms of uranium enriched to 20 % to make one crude bomb . Iran would need to reprocess the fuel to 90 % purity to have the fissile material for a nuclear bomb .\nU.S. officials believe that any effort by Tehran to begin producing the most highly enriched uranium would be detected by IAEA monitors based at Iran 's nuclear facilities in the cities of Natanz and Qom .\nMr. Netanyahu , however , stressed Thursday that he did n't believe Western intelligence was good enough to run the risk of allowing Iran to push forward with its enrichment efforts .
