    "content": "President Obama 's affection for the New York Times op-ed section is pretty well-documented at this point . David Brooks and Tom Friedman are regulars at Obama 's occasional off-the-record conversations with columnists , and attended one right before the start of airstrikes against ISIS , along with fellow columnist Frank Bruni ; Brooks in particular has been a longtime White House favorite .\nBut according to David Axelrod 's new memoir , Obama reserves an intense loathing for their colleague Maureen Dowd . Here 's how Axelrod remembers an encounter during Obama 's campaign trip to Europe in the summer of 2008 :\nMaureen Dowd , the talented but tart columnist for the Times , was traveling with us and was granted a brief interview with Obama . When we brought her to the front of the plane for the interview , however , Obama proceeded to blister her for a previous column she had written . No one got under Barack 's skin more than Maureen , whose penchant for delving into the psyches of her subjects was particularly irritating to the self-possessed Obama . Normally polite under any circumstances , he was patronizing and disrespectful to Maureen in a way that I had rarely seen . This was not well received by Dowd who , like most journalists , was accustomed to firing off salvos , yet decidedly uncomfortable when fired upon herself . After that awkward encounter , she seemed to take particular delight in psychoanalyzing Barack and belittling him in print , which only deepened his contempt . Maureen , who is as gracious and loyal to her friends as she is rough on the high and mighty , would become a friend of mine in Washington , which became a minor source of tension with Obama . `` Why are you friends with her ? '' he would demand after Maureen sent one of her acid darts his way .\nIn an email to the Huffington Post 's Michael Calderone , Dowd denied that her writing was motivated by a desire to avenge Obama 's slight , writing `` The idea that I punished him for giving me his opinion is not true and plays into an unfortunate stereotype of women , the Furies swooping down . ''\nIn any case , Obama 's certainly not the first person to lodge this particular complaint against Dowd , that she is excessively interested in psychoanalyzing political figures while neglecting what it is they 're actually advocating , that , in her own words , she `` focuses too much on the person but not enough on policy . '' In a 2005 profile by Ariel Levy in New York Magazine , Dowd dismissed this criticism as sexist : `` All the great traumatizing events of American history\u2014 Watergate , Vietnam , the Iran/contra stuff \u2014 have always been about the president \u2019 s personal demons and gremlins . So I always thought that criticism was just silly \u2026 as if it was a girlish thing to be focused on the person . ''",
