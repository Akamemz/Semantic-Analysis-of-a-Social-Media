One of the biggest knocks on him, including from the right, is that he is a legacy to a dynasty.\n\nWith Mitt Romney\u2019s withdrawal from the contest last week, Bush is now the only truly wealthy figure in the top tier of the GOP field. The 61-year-old said he recognizes that being rich and powerful can make some people suspicious of whether he truly cares about them.\n\nHe tried to address this issue head on in one of his first major public appearances since expressing interest in the presidency, likening the experience of running for president in 2016 to unsuccessfully running for governor in 1994. His dad was less than two years out of office, and his brother was running for governor of Texas simultaneously.\n\n\u201cI had these deeply held views about education, but people didn\u2019t connect with me,\u201d Bush recalled. \u201cSo when the attacks started, they didn\u2019t shrug their shoulders. That\u2019s a problem in politics: You\u2019ve got to care for people before you can get their vote.\u201d\n\nBush ran again four years later and won.\n\n\u201cIn 1998, I had the same views about education, but I went to visit 250 schools,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me, by the end of that journey, people knew that I wasn\u2019t just the brother of George W. and the son of my beloved dad. I was my own person. I earned it by working hard to connect with people on a level that truly mattered.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that experience on a national scale has got to be part of the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nBush conceded that definite advantages come from his family name. \u201cOn one level, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to watch history unfold,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s given me some perspectives that are helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut on another level,\u201d he went on, \u201cI know it\u2019s an interesting challenge for me.
