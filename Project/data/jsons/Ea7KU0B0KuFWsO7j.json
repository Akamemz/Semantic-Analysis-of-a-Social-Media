The NYT claimed that U.S. intelligence officials intercepted communications between the Trump campaign and senior Russian intelligence officials in the year leading up to the election .

The story quickly fizzled from Trump-Russia collusion to standard preparation for an incoming presidential administration .\nThree CNN employees resigned over a poorly-sourced story on the Trump transition team in June . Relying on a single , unnamed congressional source , CNN claimed that Trump adviser Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation over a meeting with a Russian banker that took place shortly before Trump \u2019 s inauguration .
