Ted Cruz wrongly claimed that the immigration bill Sen. Marco Rubio cosponsored in 2013 would have allowed the president to admit refugees without \u201c any background checks whatsoever. \u201d And Cruz claimed that the FBI director told Congress \u201c they can not vet [ Syrian ] refugees. \u201d That \u2019 s not exactly what the director said .\n\u2022 Sen. Rand Paul was wrong when he said that Rubio supported an \u201c open border \u201d policy .\n\u2022 Rubio and Cruz disagreed over the impact of the USA Freedom Act , which amended government surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act . But their argument was mainly over which system of information collection each candidate favors .\n\u2022 Sen. Lindsey Graham repeated the claim that the U.S. spends $ 350 billion \u201c to buy oil from people who hate our guts. \u201d Thirty-seven percent of those oil imports in 2014 came from Canada , with another 9 percent from Mexico .\n\u2022 Former senator Rick Santorum was incorrect in claiming Muslim immigration to the U.S. has doubled since 9/11 . Estimated legal immigration by Muslims has gone up that much from 1992 to 2012 .\n\u2022 Santorum also said \u201c 10 years ago I put the sanctions on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program. \u201d He sponsored a bill that largely codified existing sanctions .\n\u2022 Trump said the mother of the San Bernardino shooter had advance knowledge of her son \u2019 s plans , but officials have made no such charges or accusations .\nThe CNN Republican debate in Las Vegas featured nine candidates on the main stage : businessman Donald Trump , retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , Sen. Marco Rubio , former Florida governor Jeb Bush , former CEO Carly Fiorina , Sen. Ted Cruz , Ohio Gov . John Kasich , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul . Four candidates debated in the earlier undercard debate : former senator Rick Santorum , Sen. Lindsey Graham , former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former New York governor George Pataki .\nIn a contentious back-and forth , Bush insisted that three months ago , Trump said that \u201c ISIS was not our fight \u201d and that \u201c ISIS was not a factor. \u201d Trump grimaced and claimed he never said that , and we agree that Bush misconstrued Trump \u2019 s position .\nThe comments Bush assigned to Trump seem to be starkly at odds with Trump \u2019 s recent comments about the Islamic State group , also known as ISIS \u2014 just last month he was saying that he would \u201c bomb the s\u2014 out of em \u201d \u2014 but Trump \u2019 s comments back in September were more focused on whether to fight ISIS in Syria . Trump said he would be happy to let ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , with the backing of Russia , duke it out , while the U.S. took on ISIS in Iraq . We \u2019 ll let readers decide if that amounts to saying ISIS is \u201c not our fight , \u201d but it is inaccurate to say that Trump \u2019 s comment was that ISIS is \u201c not a factor . \u201d\nBush was making the point that Trump displayed a \u201c lack of seriousness \u201d as a presidential candidate and cited the comments Trump made about ISIS in late September as an example .\n\u201c Look , two months ago Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight , \u201d Bush said .\nOn a split-screen , Trump was seen shaking his head and saying , \u201c Never said that . \u201d\nAfter some back and forth , Bush continued , \u201c You said on Sept. 30 that ISIS was not a factor . \u201d\nWe reached out to the Bush campaign to clarify to which Trump comments Bush was referring , and the campaign cited a Sept. 29 article in the Washington Times that ran under the headline \u201c Donald Trump : \u2018 Let Russia fight ISIS \u2019 in Syria. \u201d The article cites a Sept. 28 interview on CNN in which Trump said that while the U.S. ought to fight ISIS in Iraq , it should let Assad and the Russians take on ISIS in Syria ( starting at the 8:48 mark ) .\nTrump , Sept. 28 on CNN : `` We have ISIS , and ISIS wants to go after Assad , but we \u2019 re knocking the hell out of \u2019 em \u2014 even though it \u2019 s not a very full-blown thing , we \u2019 re still dropping bombs all over the place and , you know , look , they \u2019 re not exactly loving life over in Syria . So we \u2019 re stopping them , to a certain extent , from going after Assad . You have Russia that \u2019 s now there . Russia \u2019 s on the side of Assad , and Russia wants to get rid of ISIS as much as we do , if not more , because they don \u2019 t want \u2019 em coming into Russia . And I \u2019 m saying , \u2018 Why are we knocking ISIS and yet at the same time we \u2019 re against Assad ? \u2019 Let them fight , take over the remnants . But more importantly , let Russia fight ISIS , if they want to fight \u2019 em \u2026 in Syria . \u2026 `` Let Syria and ISIS fight . Why do we care ? Let ISIS and Syria fight . And let Russia , they \u2019 re in Syria already , let them fight ISIS . Now look , I don \u2019 t want ISIS \u2026 ISIS is bad , they \u2019 re evil \u2026 I don \u2019 t want them . But let them fight it out . Let Russia take care of ISIS . How many places can we be ? \u2026 `` We have to get rid of ISIS , very importantly , but I look at Assad , and Assad to me looks better than the other side . And you know , this has happened before . We back a certain side , and that side turns out to be a total catastrophe . Russia likes Assad , seemingly a lot \u2014 let them worry about ISIS . Let them fight it out . Now in Iraq , we have to do it . ''\nAgain , Bush claimed Trump said \u201c ISIS was not our fight \u201d and that \u201c ISIS was not a factor. \u201d Bush could rightly argue that Trump was saying the U.S. should sit out the fight with ISIS in Syria , but in the same interview , Trump made it clear he thought the U.S. ought to combat ISIS in Iraq . And he never suggested ISIS was \u201c not a factor . \u201d\nCruz repeated his false claim that the immigration bill Rubio co-sponsored in 2013 would have allowed the president to admit refugees into the U.S. without \u201c any background checks whatsoever . \u201d\nCruz : `` Border security is national security , and you know one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees \u2014 including Syrian refugees \u2014 without mandating any background checks whatsoever . ''\nThe bill , sponsored by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer , S. 744 , would have authorized the president , under Section 3403 , to declare certain groups with common characteristics refugees for special humanitarian purposes .\nIn order to qualify for refugee status , individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president instead of demonstrating , as required under current law , that they can \u2019 t or won \u2019 t return to their home country because of \u201c persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group , or political opinion . \u201d\nBut those individuals would still be subject to the required screening process of refugees before they could come to the U.S .\n\u201c Even if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out ( including having a specific vulnerability , justified in the national interest , etc . ) and be designated as a group , they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees , \u201d wrote Joanne Kelsey , assistant director for advocacy with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service , in an email to FactCheck.org .\nMark Hetfield , president and CEO of HIAS , another migration and refugee resettlement agency in the U.S. , said the same thing .\n\u201c The provision does NOT waive or ease any of the security or other admissibility requirements . So , in fact , it would allow the Department of Homeland Security to focus on security concerns , not whether or not the applicant has a well founded fear of persecution . It makes the process faster and more efficient for designated groups , but not less secure . \u201d\nThe process for admitting a refugee has multiple steps including background checks .\nFirst , the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , or sometimes a U.S. embassy , refers a refugee for resettlement in the U.S. After that , there \u2019 s an initial multi-step security clearance that is followed by an in-person interview abroad with U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , which has to approve the application . That \u2019 s followed by a medical screening and a match with one of the voluntary agencies in the U.S. that sponsor refugees . And then there \u2019 s another security clearance to complete the process .\nAccording to the State Department , on average , the process , from the UNHCR referral to finally being admitted into the U.S. , takes 18 to 24 months .\nIn discussing his legislation to ban the U.S. from accepting Syrian refugees for three years , Cruz claimed that FBI Director James Comey told Congress \u201c they can not vet those refugees. \u201d That \u2019 s not exactly what Comey said . He said he could not give an \u201c absolute assurance that there \u2019 s no risk \u201d associated with admitting Syrian refugees .\nAt an Oct. 22 House Judiciary Committee hearing , Rep. Raul Labrador asked Comey about \u201c security gaps \u201d in vetting Syrian refugees ( at 1:47:28 into the hearing ) . Comey recalled that some \u201c serious actors \u201d from Iraq were admitted to the U.S. as refugees during the Iraq War , but he said the intelligence community \u201c has gotten much better \u201d since then about working together to review the available records .\n\u201c We learned some good lessons from the less than excellent screening of Iraqi refugees eight years ago , \u201d he said .\nBut , he acknowledged , there are unique challenges with Syrian refugees . The U.S. military controlled Iraq and as a result the U.S. had a rich data set of fingerprints , iris scans and other records of Iraqi citizens . That \u2019 s not the case in Syria .\n\u201c The challenge we face with Syria is that we don \u2019 t have that richest set of data , so even though we have gotten better , in querying what [ records ] we have we certainly will have less , \u201d Comey said .\nComey disagreed with Labrador \u2019 s characterization of the database for Syrians as \u201c obsolete. \u201d Comey said it is a \u201c less robust database , dramatically \u201d than what was available from Iraq , but the intelligence community is committed to mitigating the risk by \u201c querying well \u201d the records that do exist and seeking additional sources of information .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there \u2019 s no risk associated with this , \u201d Comey said .\nCruz has a point that the FBI director expressed concerns about how to effectively vet Syrian refugees when little or no records are available , but Comey didn \u2019 t say that the U.S. intelligence community \u201c can not vet those refugees . \u201d\nAs we have written before , the refugee review process is lengthy and involves multiple federal agencies .\nPaul went too far with his false claim that Rubio is \u201c for an open border , \u201d which essentially means anyone who wants to come to the country could do so .\nIn fact , the Senate immigration bill that Rubio co-sponsored in 2013 ( but has since distanced himself from ) includes numerous border security measures including the construction of hundreds of miles of border fencing and thousands of new border patrol agents . If Rubio supported an open border , what need would there be for that ?\nAccording to Paul , Rubio \u201c thinks he wants to be this , \u2018 Oh , I \u2019 m great and strong on national defense. \u2019 But he \u2019 s the weakest of all the candidates on immigration . He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless . \u201d\nPaul has criticized Rubio for his one-time support of S. 744 , the Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act , which included a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally . While some have argued that border security measures in the bill were inadequate , the bill did include $ 46 billion worth of border security enhancements , including 700 miles of barriers/fencing , the addition of more than 38,000 border security agents and the requirement that employers use an electronic employment eligibility verification system ( E-Verify ) .\nThe immigration plan that Rubio currently espouses on his campaign website outlines a departure from a comprehensive plan to one that begins with better border enforcement .\n\u201c The first step must be enforcement measures that are effective and verifiable , \u201d Rubio states . \u201c Such measures would include securing the most vulnerable and most trafficked sectors of the southern border , mandatory E-Verify and the full implementation of an entry-exit tracking system. \u201d Then , he said , the country should transition from a family based system to one that prioritizes \u201c merit-based , high-skilled immigration. \u201d None of that is consistent with an open-border policy .\nRubio and Cruz disagreed over the impact of the USA Freedom Act , which renewed and amended provisions of the Patriot Act related to government surveillance . But their argument boils down to which record-collection method each thinks is better for combating terrorism .\nCruz : `` [ T ] he prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls . When you had a terrorist , you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers , primarily land lines . `` The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones , now we have Internet phones , now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys . \u2026 `` What [ Rubio ] knows is that the old program covered 20 % to 30 % of phone numbers to search for terrorists . The new program covers nearly 100 % . That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism , and he knows that that \u2019 s the case . \u2026 '' Rubio : `` There is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before . `` This bill did , however , take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law \u2014 and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling . ''\nThere \u2019 s a mix of facts and opinions here : Cruz is right that the old program \u2014 in which the government collected bulk phone call data from phone companies \u2014 only affected a percentage of phone numbers . But the USA Freedom Act , which Cruz supported and Rubio didn \u2019 t , limits government access to those phone records . In that regard , the legislation did \u201c take away a \u2026 tool \u201d of the NSA , as Rubio said . But it \u2019 s a matter of opinion just how \u201c valuable \u201d that tool was .\nThe USA Freedom Act ended the government \u2019 s controversial bulk collection of phone customer data , carried out under the Patriot Act . Instead of a sweeping collection of data from phone carriers , the NSA must now make specific requests of certain data , limited \u201c to the greatest extent reasonably practicable \u201d by a \u201c specific selection term. \u201d That term could be \u201c a person , account , address , or personal device , or any other specific identifier , \u201d according to the legislation .\nThe government can \u2019 t request information based on a zip code , or ask for everything from a certain carrier , and it must demonstrate \u201c reasonable \u201d suspicion that the matter concerns terrorist activity . The legislation , which became law in June and was implemented in late November , also included provisions for increased transparency , requiring the disclosure of proceedings from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \u2014 unless they could affect national security .\nCruz said that \u201c the old program covered 20 % to 30 % of phone numbers , \u201d and it \u2019 s true that major news organizations , including The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post , reported in February 2014 that the bulk collection wasn \u2019 t rounding up even half of Americans \u2019 phone records . The Post reported : \u201c The National Security Agency is collecting less than 30 percent of all Americans \u2019 call records because of an inability to keep pace with the explosion in cellphone use , according to current and former U.S. officials . \u201d\nUnder the USA Freedom Act , the NSA would potentially have access to all records , but as we explained , it would have to make a specific request for certain records , not automatically receive bulk data from phone carriers , as it did in the past .\nRubio said the recent legislation took away \u201c a valuable tool , \u201d but whether it \u2019 s more valuable to collect bulk records or have a process to request specific records is a matter of opinion .\nGraham repeated an exaggerated and shopworn claim about oil imports that we debunked after the first GOP debates in August .\nGraham : `` I \u2019 d like to stop sending $ 350 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts , wouldn \u2019 t you ? ''\nIt \u2019 s true that the U.S. spent nearly $ 351 billion in 2014 on imported crude oil and other petroleum products , according to the U.S. Commerce Department \u2019 s Bureau of Economic Analysis .\nBut 37 % of that came from Canada , by far the biggest supplier , and another 9 % came from neighboring Mexico . That \u2019 s according to annual figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration .\nAnd according to the most recent polling by the Pew Research Center , 68 % of Canadians and 66 % of Mexicans view the U.S. favorably .\nAll Persian Gulf countries combined supplied only a little over 20 % of what the U.S. imported . And most of that came from Saudi Arabia , which just announced it has formed a coalition of 34 Muslim nations to fight terrorism and counter Islamic extremism .\nFurthermore , the $ 350 billion figure for all petroleum imports will be far lower this year , due to falling oil prices . U.S. refiners paid an average of $ 41.61 per barrel for imported oil in October , close to half the $ 82.75 price paid a year earlier , according to the EIA .\nSantorum incorrectly claimed that Muslim immigration to the U.S. has doubled since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 :\nSantorum : The reality is that under this president , since 9/11 , this anti-Muslim United States of America has doubled the rate of Muslim immigration . Since 9/11 .\nNote that first Santorum started to say Muslim immigration has doubled \u201c under this president [ Obama ] , \u201d who took office in January 2009 . Then he caught himself and moved the date back to \u201c 9/11\u2033 \u2014 in 2001 .\nEither way , he \u2019 s wrong about the date . There has indeed been a doubling of legal immigration to the U.S. by Muslims , according to a 2013 estimate by the Pew Research Center . But the increase \u2014 from about 50,000 per year to about 100,000 \u2014 occurred in the two decades starting in 1992 , Pew said . That was nine years before 9/11 , and 17 years before \u201c this president \u201d first took office .\nOther reports have said the number of Muslims living in the U.S. has doubled since 9/11 . But that \u2019 s not only due to immigration . Populations grow when births outnumber deaths , as well as from immigration . They can also grow when people convert from one religion to another .\nIn his closing statement , Santorum said \u201c 10 years ago I put the sanctions on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program. \u201d As we have written before , that \u2019 s an overstatement .\nSantorum sponsored a bill that largely codified existing sanctions . He did not put them in place .\nThe Iran Freedom Support Act , which President George W. Bush signed into law Sept. 30 , 2006 , was sponsored in the House by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and in the Senate by Santorum . It did three major things with respect to Iran :\n\u2022 \u201c [ C ] odified the ban on U.S. investment in Iran , \u201d which was imposed on May 6 , 1995 , by President\nClinton , through Executive Order 12959 , according to an Oct. 23 , 2014 , Congressional Research Service report .\n\u2022 Authorized funding for pro-democracy groups , which was a goal of earlier legislation introduced by Santorum .\n\u2022 Allowed for new sanctions against \u201c any entity that contributes to Iran \u2019 s ability to acquire chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , \u201d as described by The Washington Post . But the president has the ability to waive those sanctions . The CRS report says no sanctions have been imposed on any entities under that provision .\nAs the CRS report documents , there were more sanctions in later years that were put in place by legislation and executive orders \u2014 so for Santorum to describe his legislation as \u201c the sanctions \u201d is also a stretch .\nTrump \u2014 without proof \u2014 flatly accused the mother of the San Bernardino shooter of having advance knowledge of her son \u2019 s plans .\nAfter being asked to defend his earlier call to kill the families of terrorists , he said :\nTrump : `` We have to be much stronger than we \u2019 ve been . We have people that know what is going on . You take a look at just the attack in California the other day . There were numerous people , including the mother , that knew what was going on . `` They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor . They saw ammunition all over the place . They knew exactly what was going on . ''\nThe FBI is currently investigating what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the mother of Syed Farook knew prior to the mass shooting on Dec. 2 that officials say was the work of Syed and his wife , Tashfeen Malik , who later died in a shootout with police .\n\u201c Obviously , it \u2019 s something that we \u2019 re looking at very , very closely , \u201d U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on NBC \u2019 s Meet the Press on Dec. 6 . But she also said , \u201c I can \u2019 t characterize the knowledge of any of the other witnesses in the case . \u201d\nNBC has reported that the mother , Rafia Farook , lived in the same house where her son and his wife were building pipe bombs and stockpiling ammunition . The London Daily Mail later reported that FBI agents found shooting targets inside a car owned by the mother .\nBut so far officials have not brought any charges or made any accusation against the mother , whose lawyer says that his client didn \u2019 t know what her son was planning . So Trump was jumping to a conclusion , and his opinion may or may not be supported by the facts as they unfold .\nContributing : Joe Nahra . For a full list of sources , see FactCheck.org .",

Let Russia take care of ISIS. How many places can we be? \u2026 \"We have to get rid of ISIS, very importantly, but I look at Assad, and Assad to me looks better than the other side. And you know, this has happened before. We back a certain side, and that side turns out to be a total catastrophe. Russia likes Assad, seemingly a lot \u2014 let them worry about ISIS. Let them fight it out. Now in Iraq, we have to do it.\"\n\nAgain, Bush claimed Trump said \u201cISIS was not our fight\u201d and that \u201cISIS was not a factor.\u201d Bush could rightly argue that Trump was saying the U.S. should sit out the fight with ISIS in Syria, but in the same interview, Trump made it clear he thought the U.S. ought to combat ISIS in Iraq. And he never suggested ISIS was \u201cnot a factor.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump and Ted Cruz shake hands as they are introduced during the CNN presidential debate on Dec. 15, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images)\n\nCruz on Refugee Background Checks\n\nCruz repeated his false claim that the immigration bill Rubio co-sponsored in 2013 would have allowed the president to admit refugees into the U.S. without \u201cany background checks whatsoever.\u201d\n\nCruz: \"Border security is national security, and you know one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees \u2014 including Syrian refugees \u2014 without mandating any background checks whatsoever.\"\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, S. 744, would have authorized the president, under Section 3403, to declare certain groups with common characteristics refugees for special humanitarian purposes.\n\nIn order to qualify for refugee status, individuals would only have to prove that they were a member of the refugee group designated by the president instead of demonstrating, as required under current law, that they can\u2019t or won\u2019t return to their home country because of \u201cpersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d\n\nBut those individuals would still be subject to the required screening process of refugees before they could come to the U.S.\n\n\u201cEven if they somehow were found to fit the criteria as laid out (including having a specific vulnerability, justified in the national interest, etc.) and be designated as a group, they would still need to go through all of the same security vetting as other refugees,\u201d wrote Joanne Kelsey, assistant director for advocacy with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nMark Hetfield, president and CEO of HIAS, another migration and refugee resettlement agency in the U.S., said the same thing.\n\n\u201cThe provision does NOT waive or ease any of the security or other admissibility requirements. So, in fact, it would allow the Department of Homeland Security to focus on security concerns, not whether or not the applicant has a well founded fear of persecution. It makes the process faster and more efficient for designated groups, but not less secure.\u201d\n\nThe process for admitting a refugee has multiple steps including background checks.\n\nFirst, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or sometimes a U.S. embassy, refers a refugee for resettlement in the U.S. After that, there\u2019s an initial multi-step security clearance that is followed by an in-person interview abroad with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which has to approve the application. That\u2019s followed by a medical screening and a match with one of the voluntary agencies in the U.S. that sponsor refugees. And then there\u2019s another security clearance to complete the process.\n\nAccording to the State Department, on average, the process, from the UNHCR referral to finally being admitted into the U.S., takes 18 to 24 months.\n\nCruz Twists FBI Director\u2019s Words\n\nIn discussing his legislation to ban the U.S. from accepting Syrian refugees for three years, Cruz claimed that FBI Director James Comey told Congress \u201cthey cannot vet those refugees.\u201d That\u2019s not exactly what Comey said. He said he could not give an \u201cabsolute assurance that there\u2019s no risk\u201d associated with admitting Syrian refugees.\n\nAt an Oct. 22 House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Raul Labrador asked Comey about \u201csecurity gaps\u201d in vetting Syrian refugees (at 1:47:28 into the hearing). Comey recalled that some \u201cserious actors\u201d from Iraq were admitted to the U.S. as refugees during the Iraq War, but he said the intelligence community \u201chas gotten much better\u201d since then about working together to review the available records.\n\n\u201cWe learned some good lessons from the less than excellent screening of Iraqi refugees eight years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, he acknowledged, there are unique challenges with Syrian refugees. The U.S. military controlled Iraq and as a result the U.S. had a rich data set of fingerprints, iris scans and other records of Iraqi citizens. That\u2019s not the case in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe challenge we face with Syria is that we don\u2019t have that richest set of data, so even though we have gotten better, in querying what [records] we have we certainly will have less,\u201d Comey said.\n\nComey disagreed with Labrador\u2019s characterization of the database for Syrians as \u201cobsolete.\u201d Comey said it is a \u201cless robust database, dramatically\u201d than what was available from Iraq, but the intelligence community is committed to mitigating the risk by \u201cquerying well\u201d the records that do exist and seeking additional sources of information.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there\u2019s no risk associated with this,\u201d Comey said.\n\nCruz has a point that the FBI director expressed concerns about how to effectively vet Syrian refugees when little or no records are available, but Comey didn\u2019t say that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccannot vet those refugees.\u201d\n\nAs we have written before, the refugee review process is lengthy and involves multiple federal agencies.\n\nRand Paul speaks during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the Venetian Hotel & Casino on Dec. 15, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nPaul on Rubio\u2019s Border Policy\n\nPaul went too far with his false claim that Rubio is \u201cfor an open border,\u201d which essentially means anyone who wants to come to the country could do so.\n\nIn fact, the Senate immigration bill that Rubio co-sponsored in 2013 (but has since distanced himself from) includes numerous border security measures including the construction of hundreds of miles of border fencing and thousands of new border patrol agents. If Rubio supported an open border, what need would there be for that?\n\nAccording to Paul, Rubio \u201cthinks he wants to be this, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m great and strong on national defense.\u2019 But he\u2019s the weakest of all the candidates on immigration. He is the one for an open border that is leaving us defenseless.\u201d\n\nPaul has criticized Rubio for his one-time support of S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which included a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally. While some have argued that border security measures in the bill were inadequate, the bill did include $46 billion worth of border security enhancements, including 700 miles of barriers/fencing, the addition of more than 38,000 border security agents and the requirement that employers use an electronic employment eligibility verification system (E-Verify).\n\nThe immigration plan that Rubio currently espouses on his campaign website outlines a departure from a comprehensive plan to one that begins with better border enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe first step must be enforcement measures that are effective and verifiable,\u201d Rubio states. \u201cSuch measures would include securing the most vulnerable and most trafficked sectors of the southern border, mandatory E-Verify and the full implementation of an entry-exit tracking system.\u201d Then, he said, the country should transition from a family based system to one that prioritizes \u201cmerit-based, high-skilled immigration.\u201d None of that is consistent with an open-border policy.\n\nCruz and Rubio on NSA\n\nRubio and Cruz disagreed over the impact of the USA Freedom Act, which renewed and amended provisions of the Patriot Act related to government surveillance. But their argument boils down to which record-collection method each thinks is better for combating terrorism.\n\nCruz: \"[T]he prior program only covered a relatively narrow slice of phone calls. When you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines. \"The USA Freedom Act expands that so now we have cell phones, now we have Internet phones, now we have the phones that terrorists are likely to use and the focus of law enforcement is on targeting the bad guys. \u2026 \"What [Rubio] knows is that the old program covered 20% to 30% of phone numbers to search for terrorists. The new program covers nearly 100%. That gives us greater ability to stop acts of terrorism, and he knows that that\u2019s the case. \u2026\" Rubio: \"There is nothing that we are allowed to do under this bill that we could not do before. \"This bill did, however, take away a valuable tool that allowed the National Security Agency and other law \u2014 and other intelligence agencies to quickly and rapidly access phone records and match them up with other phone records to see who terrorists have been calling.\"\n\nThere\u2019s a mix of facts and opinions here: Cruz is right that the old program \u2014 in which the government collected bulk phone call data from phone companies \u2014 only affected a percentage of phone numbers. But the USA Freedom Act, which Cruz supported and Rubio didn\u2019t, limits government access to those phone records. In that regard, the legislation did \u201ctake away a \u2026 tool\u201d of the NSA, as Rubio said. But it\u2019s a matter of opinion just how \u201cvaluable\u201d that tool was.\n\nThe USA Freedom Act ended the government\u2019s controversial bulk collection of phone customer data, carried out under the Patriot Act. Instead of a sweeping collection of data from phone carriers, the NSA must now make specific requests of certain data, limited \u201cto the greatest extent reasonably practicable\u201d by a \u201cspecific selection term.\u201d That term could be \u201ca person, account, address, or personal device, or any other specific identifier,\u201d according to the legislation.\n\nThe government can\u2019t request information based on a zip code, or ask for everything from a certain carrier, and it must demonstrate \u201creasonable\u201d suspicion that the matter concerns terrorist activity. The legislation, which became law in June and was implemented in late November, also included provisions for increased transparency, requiring the disclosure of proceedings from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \u2014 unless they could affect national security.\n\nCruz said that \u201cthe old program covered 20% to 30% of phone numbers,\u201d and it\u2019s true that major news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, reported in February 2014 that the bulk collection wasn\u2019t rounding up even half of Americans\u2019 phone records. The Post reported: \u201cThe National Security Agency is collecting less than 30 percent of all Americans\u2019 call records because of an inability to keep pace with the explosion in cellphone use, according to current and former U.S. officials.\u201d\n\nUnder the USA Freedom Act, the NSA would potentially have access to all records, but as we explained, it would have to make a specific request for certain records, not automatically receive bulk data from phone carriers, as it did in the past.\n\nRubio said the recent legislation took away \u201ca valuable tool,\u201d but whether it\u2019s more valuable to collect bulk records or have a process to request specific records is a matter of opinion.\n\nLindsey Graham arrives on stage before the start of the undercard debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. (Photo: L.E. Baskow, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nGraham\u2019s Shopworn \u2018Hate Our Guts\u2019 Claim\n\nGraham repeated an exaggerated and shopworn claim about oil imports that we debunked after the first GOP debates in August.\n\nGraham: \"I\u2019d like to stop sending $350 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts, wouldn\u2019t you?\"\n\nIt\u2019s true that the U.S. spent nearly $351 billion in 2014 on imported crude oil and other petroleum products, according to the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nBut 37% of that came from Canada, by far the biggest supplier, and another 9% came from neighboring Mexico. That\u2019s according to annual figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nAnd according to the most recent polling by the Pew Research Center, 68% of Canadians and 66% of Mexicans view the U.S. favorably.\n\nAll Persian Gulf countries combined supplied only a little over 20% of what the U.S. imported. And most of that came from Saudi Arabia, which just announced it has formed a coalition of 34 Muslim nations to fight terrorism and counter Islamic extremism.\n\nFurthermore, the $350 billion figure for all petroleum imports will be far lower this year, due to falling oil prices. U.S. refiners paid an average of $41.61 per barrel for imported oil in October, close to half the $82.75 price paid a year earlier, according to the EIA.\n\nSantorum\u2019s Immigration Claim\n\nSantorum incorrectly claimed that Muslim immigration to the U.S. has doubled since the attacks of September 11, 2001:\n\nSantorum: The reality is that under this president, since 9/11, this anti-Muslim United States of America has doubled the rate of Muslim immigration. Since 9/11.\n\nNote that first Santorum started to say Muslim immigration has doubled \u201cunder this president [Obama],\u201d who took office in January 2009. Then he caught himself and moved the date back to \u201c9/11\u2033 \u2014 in 2001.\n\nEither way, he\u2019s wrong about the date. There has indeed been a doubling of legal immigration to the U.S. by Muslims, according to a 2013 estimate by the Pew Research Center. But the increase \u2014 from about 50,000 per year to about 100,000 \u2014 occurred in the two decades starting in 1992, Pew said. That was nine years before 9/11, and 17 years before \u201cthis president\u201d first took office.\n\nOther reports have said the number of Muslims living in the U.S. has doubled since 9/11. But that\u2019s not only due to immigration. Populations grow when births outnumber deaths, as well as from immigration. They can also grow when people convert from one religion to another.\n\nMike Huckabee shakes hands with Rick Santorum prior to the undercard debate on Dec. 15, 2015. (Photo: L.E. Baskow, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSantorum Exaggerates Role in Sanctions\n\nIn his closing statement, Santorum said \u201c10 years ago I put the sanctions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d As we have written before, that\u2019s an overstatement.\n\nSantorum sponsored a bill that largely codified existing sanctions. He did not put them in place.\n\nThe Iran Freedom Support Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law Sept. 30, 2006, was sponsored in the House by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and in the Senate by Santorum. It did three major things with respect to Iran:\n\n\u2022 \u201c[C]odified the ban on U.S. investment in Iran,\u201d which was imposed on May 6, 1995, by President\n\nClinton, through Executive Order 12959, according to an Oct. 23, 2014, Congressional Research Service report.\n\n\u2022 Authorized funding for pro-democracy groups, which was a goal of earlier legislation introduced by Santorum.\n\n\u2022 Allowed for new sanctions against \u201cany entity that contributes to Iran\u2019s ability to acquire chemical, biological or nuclear weapons,\u201d as described by The Washington Post. But the president has the ability to waive those sanctions. The CRS report says no sanctions have been imposed on any entities under that provision.\n\nAs the CRS report documents, there were more sanctions in later years that were put in place by legislation and executive orders \u2014 so for Santorum to describe his legislation as \u201cthe sanctions\u201d is also a stretch.\n\nDonald Trump walks on stage during the CNN presidential debate at The Venetian on Dec. 15, 2015, in Las Vegas. (Photo: Ethan Miller, Getty Images)\n\nTrump\u2019s Premature Jump\n\nTrump \u2014 without proof \u2014 flatly accused the mother of the San Bernardino shooter of having advance knowledge of her son\u2019s plans.\n\nAfter being asked to defend his earlier call to kill the families of terrorists, he said:\n\nTrump: \"We have to be much stronger than we\u2019ve been. We have people that know what is going on. You take a look at just the attack in California the other day. There were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on. \"They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.\"\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the mother of Syed Farook knew prior to the mass shooting on Dec. 2 that officials say was the work of Syed and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who later died in a shootout with police.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at very, very closely,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Dec. 6. But she also said, \u201cI can\u2019t characterize the knowledge of any of the other witnesses in the case. \u201d\n\nNBC has reported that the mother, Rafia Farook, lived in the same house where her son and his wife were building pipe bombs and stockpiling ammunition. The London Daily Mail later reported that FBI agents found shooting targets inside a car owned by the mother.\n\nBut so far officials have not brought any charges or made any accusation against the mother, whose lawyer says that his client didn\u2019t know what her son was planning. So Trump was jumping to a conclusion, and his opinion may or may not be supported by the facts as they unfold.\n\nContributing: Joe Nahra.
