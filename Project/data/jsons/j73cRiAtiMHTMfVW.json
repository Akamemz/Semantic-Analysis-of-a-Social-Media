    "content": "From The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today : A former Senate aide to Joe Biden has accused him of assaulting her in 1993 . My colleague Lisa Lerer examines the allegation . It \u2019 s Tuesday , April 14 . Lisa , when did you begin reporting this story ?\nSo about a year ago , we were reporting on allegations from a number of women who came out and said that Joe Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable .\narchived recording Tonight , Joe Biden is facing troubling accusations . Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores claims the former vice president inappropriately touched and kissed her head before a rally in 2014 .\nMaybe it was a squeeze on the shoulder , maybe he smelled their hair \u2014\narchived recording ( lucy flores ) \u2014 out of nowhere , I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders , get up very close to me from behind , lean in , smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head .\nBut this was all happening in public , at campaign rallies , at fund-raisers .\narchived recording 1 He put his hands around my head and pulled me in . archived recording 2 Former congressional aide Amy Lappos told CBS News tonight that Joe Biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a fundraiser in Greenwich , Connecticut in 2009 .\nAnd we in the newsroom and in the media , we \u2019 re really grappling with how to think and talk about this behavior . This wasn \u2019 t anything like what had normally come up in a lot of these discussions around # MeToo , like Harvey Weinstein or any of that .\narchived recording ( lucy flores ) And for the record , I don \u2019 t believe that it was a bad intention . I \u2019 m not in any way suggesting that I felt sexually assaulted or sexually harassed . I felt invaded . I felt that there was a violation of my personal space . There was no \u2014\nThe women talking about these allegations weren \u2019 t quite sure what to call it . Some of them said quite vehemently that they didn \u2019 t consider it sexual harassment . But they wanted the former vice president to be aware of his behavior and how it could make people feel . Others had a slightly different perspective . They thought it was something closer to sexual harassment . So this goes on for really a couple weeks . And in the end , Biden \u2014 he doesn \u2019 t quite apologize .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) Today , I want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement that I \u2019 ve made to women and some men , and it made them uncomfortable .\nBut he comes out and he makes an online video where he says that he has a very touchy feely kind of political style .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) In my career , I \u2019 ve always tried to make a human connection . That \u2019 s my responsibility , I think . I shake hands , I hug people , I grab men and women by the shoulders and say , you can do this .\nBut he recognizes that times have changed , and perhaps he needs to change with them and be more respectful of people \u2019 s space .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) You know , social norms have begun to change , they \u2019 ve shifted , and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset . And I get it . I get it . I hear what they \u2019 re saying . I understand it . And I \u2019 ll be much more mindful . That \u2019 s my responsibility . My responsibility . And I \u2019 ll meet it .\nAnd then , I met Tara Reade . And she had called me with sort of similar kind of story . Joe Biden had touched her , he \u2019 d put his hands in her hair , he touched her shoulders , all in public , in ways that really made her feel uncomfortable . But her story had a little bit of a different twist . So she , at the time , had been working in his Senate office . And this was about \u2014 I think December 1992 to August 1993 . She was a low-level staffer , a staff assistant . And she said that the touching had gone beyond just hands in the hair and squeezes of the shoulder . That there had been harassment .\nShe says he had asked her to serve drinks at a cocktail party . He had commented on her looks in the office , in front of other people . And that she felt that he had cultivated a culture in his office that fostered and permitted this kind of sexual harassment .\nAnd what did you do with Reade \u2019 s story , with that reporting ?\nWell , I talked to her . I talked to her friend , who corroborated a lot of what she was telling me . We did use her allegations to call a whole bunch of people who had worked in Joe Biden \u2019 s office in the 1990s \u2014 particularly the early 1990s , which was the period that Tara Reade was working there \u2014 to see if they remembered any kind of harassment , what the environment of the office was at the time . But we didn \u2019 t really come up with anything all that surprising or explosive . Nobody really confirmed her account at that time . So we actually didn \u2019 t end up reporting them in the paper . We had already reported on a number of allegations from these women who said that they were uncomfortable with Joe Biden \u2019 s touching . And we just sort of moved on . And the political world did too . Everyone moved on to the next battle . There was the Mueller report to contend with , and then a really competitive primary , presidential debates started . So this issue of the unwanted touching and Tara \u2019 s story just never came back up .\nMm hmm . And Lisa , do you think that has something to do with the fact that Biden confronted this , talked about it and said he was learning from it ?\nOh , for sure . But he was really forced into confronting it . I mean , this was a period in March , in April , before Biden had formally announced his presidential bid , where he was going through the process of reconciling a lot of his record with the current mores of the Democratic Party . He was dealing with his criminal justice record , he was dealing with his positions on abortion and sort of moving to the left with the party . And so I think that quasi-apology video was part of that process . You have a Democratic Party that \u2019 s acutely aware of issues of racial and gender bias , and Biden had to eventually reconcile those criticisms \u2014 whether he felt they were fair or not \u2014 with where the party was . But ultimately , he didn \u2019 t pay much of a price for it . He announced his campaign a couple three or so weeks later . His opponents never made an issue of this and everything sort of moved on .\nWell , you have the primary race . So Biden , as we all know , nosedives . Then he comes back up , he becomes the front-runner . And around that time \u2014\narchived recording ( katie halper ) Hello , and welcome to the Katie Halper Show .\narchived recording ( katie halper ) Where would you like to start ? Where does the story start for you ? archived recording ( tara reade ) Well , the story starts when I went to work for Joe Biden .\nAnd levels a really serious , serious accusation against Joe Biden , which is basically that he sexually assaulted her .\narchived recording ( tara reade ) And my body \u2014 I was shaking everywhere , because it was cold all of a sudden , and I was \u2014 I don \u2019 t know , I feel like I was shaking , just everywhere . And I was trying to grasp what had just happened , and what I should do .\nAnd that woman , who tells her story in great detail on this podcast , is Tara Reade .\nSo what are you thinking at this point ? Because you had already talked to this woman , and she had not mentioned this kind of accusation , right ?\nWell , I must admit , I \u2019 m a little confused , because it didn \u2019 t come up at all . And so the first thing I did was pull up my notes . And when I look over my notes and I read the story she had told me a year ago , there \u2019 s some holes in that story she told me . Things I remember thinking that her reaction was maybe a bit extreme for what she said she was experiencing in the office at the time . That maybe make a little more sense if this other thing had in fact happened \u2014 this sexual assault . So I wondered , first of all , had she been truthful the first time around ? Was she being truthful now ? And also , whether I had asked the right questions . Did I miss something because I hadn \u2019 t called back , because I got caught up with the dynamics of this primary ?\nSo at this point \u2014 after Tara Reade has gone on this podcast , she has made this claim , and you \u2019 re trying to figure out why she didn \u2019 t first tell you that same information \u2014 how are you now approaching this story , journalistically ?\nSo I think we all quickly agreed that it wasn \u2019 t a question of whether we would approach the story , but how . This was a woman who was making very serious allegations of sexual assault with her name attached , publicly , against the man who is more than likely to become the Democratic nominee for president . So we had to grapple with these claims . The question was , how ? And I think the natural thing to do \u2014 really , the human thing to do \u2014 is to go into a story like this and say , do you believe or not believe the person who \u2019 s making the accusation ? But that \u2019 s not the journalistic thing to do . We \u2019 re not judges , we \u2019 re not the jury , we \u2019 re not the police department . I was really focused on what we could show to be true and what we could show to not be true . What we had corroboration on , and what we didn \u2019 t have corroboration on . And what kind of facts we could give voters and the American public about this whole incident , that \u2019 s already out in the world and being passed around quite actively on social media . People knew about it .\nBut they didn \u2019 t know the details , and they didn \u2019 t really know what was true or not .\nAnd so where do you begin as you \u2019 re trying to figure this all out ?\nWell , so the main thing I needed to do was get Tara Reade back on the phone . So that \u2019 s where I began .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . So Lisa , tell me about this , I guess , second round of communications that you have with Tara Reade , after she claims that Joe Biden has assaulted her .\nSo I call her , and we start talking every day . And the obvious first question I ask her is why she didn \u2019 t tell me about these allegations when we talked a year ago . And she tells me that even though they weren \u2019 t published in The New York Times , they were published in a local paper . And the feedback she got from that being out there , the kind of death threats and harassment online , made her reluctant to tell the rest of her story . So we talk through all that , and then eventually , I say to her that I need her to tell me the story that she told on that podcast in a way that we can use on the record . And I start recording her .\ninterposing voices Hello ? Can you hear me ? Yeah , I hear you . Yep , I got you .\nlisa lerer So where do you want to start ? tara reade OK . So let \u2019 s start with the assault .\nSo the story that I \u2019 m about to tell you is all according to Tara Reade . So it \u2019 s 1993 , in the spring some time , and she \u2019 s working as a staff assistant in Joe Biden \u2019 s Senate office . And one day , she \u2019 s at work , and her supervisor comes up to her and has this athletic bag \u2014 this gym bag \u2014 and asks her if she would find the senator and bring him his gym bag .\ntara reade She just said , take him his gym bag , hurry ! And she was like , he \u2019 ll meet you , he \u2019 s down towards the Capitol .\nSo she heads down and finds him somewhere in the Capitol complex of offices .\ntara reade And I ran into him , like I saw him , and I \u2014 he acknowledged me , he was talking to someone , they walked away . And then he said , come here , Tara . And then he smiled at me , greeted me .\ntara reade I called him \u201c Senator. \u201d I didn \u2019 t call him \u201c Joe. \u201d And I handed him the bag with my right hand , I remember that .\nAnd the next thing she remembers , he \u2019 s pinned her up against a wall , which she remembers as being very , very cold . And he \u2019 s kissing her .\ntara reade It happened at once , and that \u2019 s what \u2019 s so hard about telling this story . Like he \u2019 s talking to me , and his hands are everywhere , and everything \u2019 s happening at once very quickly . This happened , like , in under two minutes .\nAnd according to Tara , he reaches his hand under her shirt \u2014 she remembers she was wearing a cream-colored blouse \u2014 grabs her left breast .\ntara reade He used his knee to part my knees , because my legs went together . And he went kind of down my skirt , and then as he \u2019 s parting my legs with his knee , he like went up , and then just went under . And then , of course , yeah , he was able to do what he did , which was he took \u2014 it felt like one or two fingers , and inserted them in my vagina .\nAnd at that point , he \u2019 s kissing her and he says to her , she says , do you want to go somewhere else ? And he tried \u2014 she said \u2014 to kiss her on the mouth , but she moves her head .\ntara reade And then he pulled back , because I wasn \u2019 t responding to him , I wasn \u2019 t kissing him back . I completely froze up , and he had kind of lifted me up , so I was like up on my tippy toes almost . And then he looked back and he looked at me \u2014\nAnd he looks at her , and he says , according to her \u2014\ntara reade Come on , man . I heard you liked me . Then he smiled , but then when I looked at his eyes , he was angry . Like there \u2014\nAnd she said she remembers standing there , just kind of frozen , and she felt almost a little bad , like she had put him in a bad position . And she was wondering what she did to make him think that she would be interested in this . And according to Tara , he looked her and he said \u2014\ntara reade He pointed his finger at me and he just goes , you \u2019 re \u2014 you \u2019 re nothing to me . And then he looked at me , and he goes , nothing .\nYou \u2019 re nothing to me . Nothing . And she thinks she must have looked a certain way or had a certain expression in her eye , because then he kind of took her by the shoulders and patted her shoulders , and said , you \u2019 re OK , you \u2019 re fine . And he kind of almost set her down , she said , and then he walked off and walked down the hall .\ntara reade I know I went to the restroom , I know I did , to clean up . But I don \u2019 t remember which restroom I went to in the Russell Building or there \u2014 I don \u2019 t know . But I know I did . But my vivid memory next is sitting \u2014 I was trying to pull myself together in the back stairs at the Russell Building with those big windows . I remember just sitting on the stairs , and nobody was there . And just like my whole body was literally \u2014 I couldn \u2019 t control my shaking . I remember just being so cold . So cold .\nAnd then she headed home . She doesn \u2019 t remember how she got there . She doesn \u2019 t remember whether she went back into the office and got her bag or talked to anybody . But she made it home to her apartment .\ntara reade The next thing I remember is being on the phone with my mom and crying and then arguing with her .\nAnd her mother tells her in fairly firm language that she needs to immediately file a police report .\ntara reade You know , she even swore at me . She was not being gentle and supportive , and I understand , because she wanted me to have evidence . And now I understand what she was trying to do , and I didn \u2019 t then .\nAnd does she say why she did not go to the police ?\nWell , what she says is that she basically just wanted the whole thing to go away , is what she told me . That after it happened , she took a shower . She says she threw out all her clothes that she was wearing at the time .\ntara reade I threw everything out . Even the shoes . Everything . Like , I just \u2014 that \u2019 s how I felt about it . lisa lerer Really ? What kind of \u2014\nShe tells me that she called in sick to work , that she was sobbing uncontrollably .\ntara reade It \u2019 s like I just didn \u2019 t want it to have happened . It just didn \u2019 t happen .\nAnd what does she say happens in the days and maybe even weeks after this alleged incident ?\nSo she tells me eventually she does go back to work . And when she does , she says that she tells her immediate supervisor , who \u2019 s Biden \u2019 s personal secretary , as well as two top staffers in the office \u2014 the deputy chief of staff and the chief of staff \u2014 that she feels uncomfortable around Joe Biden . She never mentions the alleged assault , but she talks more about feeling uncomfortable with him touching her shoulders or tangling his hands in her hair . And in her telling , the staff don \u2019 t really do anything about that . In fact , she feels that they kind of penalize her for bringing that forward . She says they strip her of one of her duties , which is supervising the interns . She says they put her in a windowless office , far from the rest of the staff . So at some point , she says that she goes to a Senate personnel office and files a formal complaint .\nShe said that complaint really detailed the harassment and what she saw as retaliation in the office . But she believes that that forum eventually was returned to Biden \u2019 s office , which would have been a flouting of what the official protocol was at that time . And once that complaint was returned to Biden \u2019 s office , she says , she was given a month to find a new job , and basically eased out of her position . And so she started looking for another position on Capitol Hill , she says , and never ended up getting hired or finding anything .\nSo Lisa , once Tara Reade has given you this account of an alleged attack , what do you do next ?\nSo at this point , she \u2019 s told me a lot of information . And some really detailed information too . So I start thinking about what can be corroborated , what we can show to be true and what we can show to be not true . And one thing that Tara mentions to me is that at the time , she had called a friend and told her the whole story . So I tracked down the friend .\nAnd in large part , she corroborates the story that Tara had told me . Tara tells me she also told her mother . Her mother is deceased , so she can \u2019 t be called . And she told a version of her story to her brother , though not all the details . So I start trying to track down her brother . And she tells me she told a friend in 2008 , after Joe Biden had been picked as Barack Obama \u2019 s vice president . She had told a version of this story to that friend , without all the details , but that something had happened to her . So I tracked down that friend , and she confirms that account and some of the things that Tara tells me .\nSo it leaves us with something , but certainly not enough to corroborate this entire story . We really only have the one friend with the full story , and everyone else is just giving us bits and pieces . So that \u2019 s not the kind of full corroboration that you \u2019 re looking for as a journalist , when you \u2019 re trying to confirm really serious allegations and also really politically explosive allegations . But at this point , it \u2019 s time to turn to the Biden side of things . So along with my colleague Sydney Ember , we start looking at who we can talk to . And we start by calling the three top staffers in the office at the time that Tara had mentioned she had spoken with , and she had raised those complaints of harassment to . All three of them say that a woman named Tara Reade never approached them with these kind of allegations , and two of them said they didn \u2019 t remember her at all even working in the office .\nSo just to be clear , the three people that Tara Reade said she went to and told of Biden \u2019 s behavior that made her uncomfortable , pretty senior people in his office , they say they have no recollection of that ever happening ?\nExactly . They have no recollection . And a lot of the former staffers are mystified by her account too . They don \u2019 t remember anything like this , or even the hint of anything like this . So they \u2014 when Sydney and I call them , they \u2019 re trying to reconcile themselves her story with what they remember from working in that office . A lot of them didn \u2019 t want to talk on the record . One who did said that at the time , you knew who the good guys and bad guys were on the Senate . The places where \u2014 offices where women would and would not want to work , and she described Biden as one of the good guys .\nSo after that , we reached out to another group of people , which is the interns . And that \u2019 s because Tara had told me that she supervised the interns , and that she shared an office with these interns . So I reached two of them , and they both tell me that they \u2019 d never heard of anything , never saw anything like the kind of harassment and assault Tara had been alleging . But that they did remember midway through their internship , sometime in April , she had been suddenly removed as their boss . And they never knew why , and they never saw her again . So amid all this confusion , I remember that there \u2019 s one thing that really could cut through all this and clarify exactly what did or did not happen .\nAnd that \u2019 s this complaint that Tara had told me she filed in 1993 with the Senate office \u2014\n\u2014 and that someone had written down . So we start trying to track down that complaint . And we call the Federal Office of Personnel Management , and they tell us to file a Freedom of Information request , which would take months , if not years . And anyhow , we don \u2019 t really know exactly what we \u2019 re asking for , because she doesn \u2019 t remember the name of the office where she filed this complaint .\nWe call over to the Senate and we \u2019 re able to get some employment records , but not this complaint . So we basically look for this document and come up empty . It \u2019 s unfindable in the end .\nWhat about other aspects of Reade \u2019 s life that might feel relevant ? I mean , possible political affiliations or motivations . How do you begin to think and report on those ?\nWell , so one thing that we want to be really sure of is that she is who she says she is . And that this isn \u2019 t someone in the midst of a heated presidential campaign \u2014 that \u2019 s only , of course , going to get more heated by all expectations \u2014 that is trying to push an agenda , or possibly pull a fast one on the media to try to get claims that are untrue out there in the public . So I really talked to her a lot about her political affiliation . She describes herself as a third-generation Democrat , but walks me through the fact that she liked Marianne Williamson . She really liked Elizabeth Warren . and when California voted in the primary over Super Tuesday , she backed Bernie Sanders . But she insists that her motivation for this is not political , even though I had watched as supporters of Sanders and supporters of President Trump , really , are the ones pushing this allegation out there on social media , and really keeping the drumbeat up for people to investigate it . So that \u2019 s one concern . And there is this other unusual detail .\nWell , she had written a fair amount in Medium posts and on Twitter about her support for Russia and her respect for Vladimir Putin . And so we read through all those Medium posts . Some of them had been pulled down off the internet , but we found them . We looked through those old Twitter posts , and we really tried to investigate whether there could be some kind of nefarious agenda there . And she says that she was misguided . Tara Reade says that she had been working on a novel \u2014 she \u2019 s not anymore \u2014 about Russia , and this was all part of her research . And she says that she doesn \u2019 t have any respect for Vladimir Putin now , has never been to Russia . So we decide that that \u2019 s not so disqualifying that it prevents us from putting a version of her story in the paper .\nSo how are you thinking about everything that you have reported at this point ? And I assume , in consultation with your editors , how are you planning to proceed ?\nWell , one thing we know is that we can \u2019 t corroborate her story beyond the two friends and her brother .\nWe know we can \u2019 t find any documents , and we know that everyone who worked for Joe Biden is denying that anything like this ever happened , or could have happened .\nAnd we also know one other thing . And this is really important . As far as we \u2019 ve learned in our reporting , there is no pattern of this kind of behavior from Joe Biden . What we had seen a year ago was a very different thing . It was touching in public , rubbing of shoulders , or maybe touching of hair that made some women feel uncomfortable . This is an allegation of a sexual assault . Those things are not at all similar . And in fact , what Tara Reade is alleging is a fairly singular act , as far as we know . But the Democratic Party , they \u2019 ve really set a very high standard for taking these cases seriously , for taking allegations of sexual abuse seriously . Even Joe Biden has taken a strong position on this , and it \u2019 s worth remembering the Kavanaugh hearings . And one thing that Joe Biden said when that was all going on was this , he said : \u201c For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus , nationally , you \u2019 ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she \u2019 s talking about is real , whether or not she forgets facts , whether or not it \u2019 s been made worse or better over time . But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron .\nThat \u2019 s exactly right . Biden essentially saying , believe women . And I think that explains part of the approach to these allegations that you \u2019 ve seen from his campaign . Joe Biden himself has not spoken about them at all , and I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s been asked directly , although I suppose that could come . But his campaign has been very careful in all their public statements to say that they believe women , that they think coming out like this is a credible thing to do . But in this case , they say the allegations are false . But they \u2019 re really walking a tightrope when they talk about this politically , with many in the base of the Democratic Party .\nWell , help me understand that . I mean , with all that history in mind that you just described , of the Democratic Party setting such a high standard for itself \u2014 and Biden himself , the presumptive Democratic nominee , saying , believe women \u2014 how is the Democratic establishment , how is the Democratic Party responding to what Tara Reade has alleged happened to her ?\nThey \u2019 re not responding . Nobody in the Democratic establishment , elected officials , party leaders , has discussed this at all .\nWhy do you think that is ? I mean , is that a function of the conflicting information here ? Is that party loyalty to the de facto nominee ? Is that about the fact that there is just one of these accusations , not a pattern , as you just said ? How do you explain that ?\nWell , honestly , I think it \u2019 s some of all of that . When I talk to people who are close to Joe Biden , and I \u2019 ve now talked to quite a lot of them , they say that this is something that \u2019 s just so completely out of character for him . They describe a man who \u2019 s fiercely devoted to his wife and his kids . That he would spend a lot of time focusing on when he could get the quickest train , the soonest train , home to Delaware so he could see them . And they just can not reconcile these allegations that are out with the guy that they have known for all these decades . So they say they can \u2019 t believe it \u2019 s true . But when you look at the political calendar , we \u2019 re in the spring of an election year , Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee . So you have to figure that many , many Democrats also just don \u2019 t want this to be true .\narchived recording ( bernie sanders ) So today , I am asking all Americans \u2014 I \u2019 m asking every Democrat , I \u2019 m asking every independent , I \u2019 m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy , which I endorse .\nOn Monday , Joe Biden was endorsed by his former rival , Senator Bernie Sanders .\narchived recording ( joe biden ) Well , Bernie I want to thank you for that . It \u2019 s a big deal . I think that your endorsement means a great deal . It means a great deal to me .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today .\nOn Monday , France said it would extend a nationwide lockdown until the middle of May . Britain was expected to extend its lockdown . And Russia \u2019 s president offered his darkest assessment yet of the virus \u2019 s impact there .\nDuring a meeting with his advisors , Vladimir Putin said , quote , \u201c We see the situation changing daily . And unfortunately , not for the better . \u201d\narchived recording ( andrew cuomo ) Thank you very much . Good afternoon to everyone . Let me welcome my fellow governors , who are on the telephone , who you \u2019 ll hear from in a moment .\nIn the U.S. , two groups of governors \u2014 one on the east coast , the other on the west coast \u2014 said they would decide regionally when and how to reopen their state \u2019 s economies , and emphasized that they would not do so until experts and data showed that it would be safe .\narchived recording ( andrew cuomo ) Again , we anticipate different facts , different circumstances for different states , different parts of states .

    "content_original": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Today: A former Senate aide to Joe Biden has accused him of assaulting her in 1993. My colleague Lisa Lerer examines the allegation. It\u2019s Tuesday, April 14. Lisa, when did you begin reporting this story?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo about a year ago, we were reporting on allegations from a number of women who came out and said that Joe Biden had touched them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable.\n\narchived recording Tonight, Joe Biden is facing troubling accusations. Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores claims the former vice president inappropriately touched and kissed her head before a rally in 2014.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nMaybe it was a squeeze on the shoulder, maybe he smelled their hair \u2014\n\narchived recording (lucy flores) \u2014 out of nowhere, I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nBut this was all happening in public, at campaign rallies, at fund-raisers.\n\narchived recording 1 He put his hands around my head and pulled me in. archived recording 2 Former congressional aide Amy Lappos told CBS News tonight that Joe Biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut in 2009.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd we in the newsroom and in the media, we\u2019re really grappling with how to think and talk about this behavior. This wasn\u2019t anything like what had normally come up in a lot of these discussions around #MeToo, like Harvey Weinstein or any of that.\n\narchived recording (lucy flores) And for the record, I don\u2019t believe that it was a bad intention. I\u2019m not in any way suggesting that I felt sexually assaulted or sexually harassed. I felt invaded. I felt that there was a violation of my personal space. There was no \u2014\n\nlisa lerer\n\nThe women talking about these allegations weren\u2019t quite sure what to call it. Some of them said quite vehemently that they didn\u2019t consider it sexual harassment. But they wanted the former vice president to be aware of his behavior and how it could make people feel. Others had a slightly different perspective. They thought it was something closer to sexual harassment. So this goes on for really a couple weeks. And in the end, Biden \u2014 he doesn\u2019t quite apologize.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Today, I want to talk about gestures of support and encouragement that I\u2019ve made to women and some men, and it made them uncomfortable.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nBut he comes out and he makes an online video where he says that he has a very touchy feely kind of political style.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) In my career, I\u2019ve always tried to make a human connection. That\u2019s my responsibility, I think. I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say, you can do this.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nBut he recognizes that times have changed, and perhaps he needs to change with them and be more respectful of people\u2019s space.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) You know, social norms have begun to change, they\u2019ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what they\u2019re saying. I understand it. And I\u2019ll be much more mindful. That\u2019s my responsibility. My responsibility. And I\u2019ll meet it.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd then, I met Tara Reade. And she had called me with sort of similar kind of story. Joe Biden had touched her, he\u2019d put his hands in her hair, he touched her shoulders, all in public, in ways that really made her feel uncomfortable. But her story had a little bit of a different twist. So she, at the time, had been working in his Senate office. And this was about \u2014 I think December 1992 to August 1993. She was a low-level staffer, a staff assistant. And she said that the touching had gone beyond just hands in the hair and squeezes of the shoulder. That there had been harassment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nShe says he had asked her to serve drinks at a cocktail party. He had commented on her looks in the office, in front of other people. And that she felt that he had cultivated a culture in his office that fostered and permitted this kind of sexual harassment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did you do with Reade\u2019s story, with that reporting?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, I talked to her. I talked to her friend, who corroborated a lot of what she was telling me. We did use her allegations to call a whole bunch of people who had worked in Joe Biden\u2019s office in the 1990s \u2014 particularly the early 1990s, which was the period that Tara Reade was working there \u2014 to see if they remembered any kind of harassment, what the environment of the office was at the time. But we didn\u2019t really come up with anything all that surprising or explosive. Nobody really confirmed her account at that time. So we actually didn\u2019t end up reporting them in the paper. We had already reported on a number of allegations from these women who said that they were uncomfortable with Joe Biden\u2019s touching. And we just sort of moved on. And the political world did too. Everyone moved on to the next battle. There was the Mueller report to contend with, and then a really competitive primary, presidential debates started. So this issue of the unwanted touching and Tara\u2019s story just never came back up.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm hmm. And Lisa, do you think that has something to do with the fact that Biden confronted this, talked about it and said he was learning from it?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nOh, for sure. But he was really forced into confronting it. I mean, this was a period in March, in April, before Biden had formally announced his presidential bid, where he was going through the process of reconciling a lot of his record with the current mores of the Democratic Party. He was dealing with his criminal justice record, he was dealing with his positions on abortion and sort of moving to the left with the party. And so I think that quasi-apology video was part of that process. You have a Democratic Party that\u2019s acutely aware of issues of racial and gender bias, and Biden had to eventually reconcile those criticisms \u2014 whether he felt they were fair or not \u2014 with where the party was. But ultimately, he didn\u2019t pay much of a price for it. He announced his campaign a couple three or so weeks later. His opponents never made an issue of this and everything sort of moved on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so what happens next?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, you have the primary race. So Biden, as we all know, nosedives. Then he comes back up, he becomes the front-runner. And around that time \u2014\n\narchived recording (katie halper) Hello, and welcome to the Katie Halper Show.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nA woman goes on a podcast \u2014\n\narchived recording (katie halper) Where would you like to start? Where does the story start for you? archived recording (tara reade) Well, the story starts when I went to work for Joe Biden.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd levels a really serious, serious accusation against Joe Biden, which is basically that he sexually assaulted her.\n\narchived recording (tara reade) And my body \u2014 I was shaking everywhere, because it was cold all of a sudden, and I was \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I feel like I was shaking, just everywhere. And I was trying to grasp what had just happened, and what I should do.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd that woman, who tells her story in great detail on this podcast, is Tara Reade.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what are you thinking at this point? Because you had already talked to this woman, and she had not mentioned this kind of accusation, right?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, I must admit, I\u2019m a little confused, because it didn\u2019t come up at all. And so the first thing I did was pull up my notes. And when I look over my notes and I read the story she had told me a year ago, there\u2019s some holes in that story she told me. Things I remember thinking that her reaction was maybe a bit extreme for what she said she was experiencing in the office at the time. That maybe make a little more sense if this other thing had in fact happened \u2014 this sexual assault. So I wondered, first of all, had she been truthful the first time around? Was she being truthful now? And also, whether I had asked the right questions. Did I miss something because I hadn\u2019t called back, because I got caught up with the dynamics of this primary?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point \u2014 after Tara Reade has gone on this podcast, she has made this claim, and you\u2019re trying to figure out why she didn\u2019t first tell you that same information \u2014 how are you now approaching this story, journalistically?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo I think we all quickly agreed that it wasn\u2019t a question of whether we would approach the story, but how. This was a woman who was making very serious allegations of sexual assault with her name attached, publicly, against the man who is more than likely to become the Democratic nominee for president. So we had to grapple with these claims. The question was, how? And I think the natural thing to do \u2014 really, the human thing to do \u2014 is to go into a story like this and say, do you believe or not believe the person who\u2019s making the accusation? But that\u2019s not the journalistic thing to do. We\u2019re not judges, we\u2019re not the jury, we\u2019re not the police department. I was really focused on what we could show to be true and what we could show to not be true. What we had corroboration on, and what we didn\u2019t have corroboration on. And what kind of facts we could give voters and the American public about this whole incident, that\u2019s already out in the world and being passed around quite actively on social media. People knew about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nBut they didn\u2019t know the details, and they didn\u2019t really know what was true or not.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so where do you begin as you\u2019re trying to figure this all out?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, so the main thing I needed to do was get Tara Reade back on the phone. So that\u2019s where I began.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Lisa, tell me about this, I guess, second round of communications that you have with Tara Reade, after she claims that Joe Biden has assaulted her.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo I call her, and we start talking every day. And the obvious first question I ask her is why she didn\u2019t tell me about these allegations when we talked a year ago. And she tells me that even though they weren\u2019t published in The New York Times, they were published in a local paper. And the feedback she got from that being out there, the kind of death threats and harassment online, made her reluctant to tell the rest of her story. So we talk through all that, and then eventually, I say to her that I need her to tell me the story that she told on that podcast in a way that we can use on the record. And I start recording her.\n\ninterposing voices Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Yep, I got you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does she say?\n\nlisa lerer So where do you want to start? tara reade OK. So let\u2019s start with the assault.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo the story that I\u2019m about to tell you is all according to Tara Reade. So it\u2019s 1993, in the spring some time, and she\u2019s working as a staff assistant in Joe Biden\u2019s Senate office. And one day, she\u2019s at work, and her supervisor comes up to her and has this athletic bag \u2014 this gym bag \u2014 and asks her if she would find the senator and bring him his gym bag.\n\ntara reade She just said, take him his gym bag, hurry! And she was like, he\u2019ll meet you, he\u2019s down towards the Capitol.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo she heads down and finds him somewhere in the Capitol complex of offices.\n\ntara reade And I ran into him, like I saw him, and I \u2014 he acknowledged me, he was talking to someone, they walked away. And then he said, come here, Tara. And then he smiled at me, greeted me.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd she says, hello, Senator.\n\ntara reade I called him \u201cSenator.\u201d I didn\u2019t call him \u201cJoe.\u201d And I handed him the bag with my right hand, I remember that.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd the next thing she remembers, he\u2019s pinned her up against a wall, which she remembers as being very, very cold. And he\u2019s kissing her.\n\ntara reade It happened at once, and that\u2019s what\u2019s so hard about telling this story. Like he\u2019s talking to me, and his hands are everywhere, and everything\u2019s happening at once very quickly. This happened, like, in under two minutes.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd according to Tara, he reaches his hand under her shirt \u2014 she remembers she was wearing a cream-colored blouse \u2014 grabs her left breast.\n\ntara reade He used his knee to part my knees, because my legs went together. And he went kind of down my skirt, and then as he\u2019s parting my legs with his knee, he like went up, and then just went under. And then, of course, yeah, he was able to do what he did, which was he took \u2014 it felt like one or two fingers, and inserted them in my vagina.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd at that point, he\u2019s kissing her and he says to her, she says, do you want to go somewhere else? And he tried \u2014 she said \u2014 to kiss her on the mouth, but she moves her head.\n\ntara reade And then he pulled back, because I wasn\u2019t responding to him, I wasn\u2019t kissing him back. I completely froze up, and he had kind of lifted me up, so I was like up on my tippy toes almost. And then he looked back and he looked at me \u2014\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd he looks at her, and he says, according to her \u2014\n\ntara reade Come on, man. I heard you liked me. Then he smiled, but then when I looked at his eyes, he was angry. Like there \u2014\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd she said she remembers standing there, just kind of frozen, and she felt almost a little bad, like she had put him in a bad position. And she was wondering what she did to make him think that she would be interested in this. And according to Tara, he looked her and he said \u2014\n\ntara reade He pointed his finger at me and he just goes, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re nothing to me. And then he looked at me, and he goes, nothing.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nYou\u2019re nothing to me. Nothing. And she thinks she must have looked a certain way or had a certain expression in her eye, because then he kind of took her by the shoulders and patted her shoulders, and said, you\u2019re OK, you\u2019re fine. And he kind of almost set her down, she said, and then he walked off and walked down the hall.\n\ntara reade I know I went to the restroom, I know I did, to clean up. But I don\u2019t remember which restroom I went to in the Russell Building or there \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But I know I did. But my vivid memory next is sitting \u2014 I was trying to pull myself together in the back stairs at the Russell Building with those big windows. I remember just sitting on the stairs, and nobody was there. And just like my whole body was literally \u2014 I couldn\u2019t control my shaking. I remember just being so cold. So cold.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd then she headed home. She doesn\u2019t remember how she got there. She doesn\u2019t remember whether she went back into the office and got her bag or talked to anybody. But she made it home to her apartment.\n\ntara reade The next thing I remember is being on the phone with my mom and crying and then arguing with her.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd her mother tells her in fairly firm language that she needs to immediately file a police report.\n\ntara reade You know, she even swore at me. She was not being gentle and supportive, and I understand, because she wanted me to have evidence. And now I understand what she was trying to do, and I didn\u2019t then.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nBut Tara doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd does she say why she did not go to the police?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, what she says is that she basically just wanted the whole thing to go away, is what she told me. That after it happened, she took a shower. She says she threw out all her clothes that she was wearing at the time.\n\ntara reade I threw everything out. Even the shoes. Everything. Like, I just \u2014 that\u2019s how I felt about it. lisa lerer Really? What kind of \u2014\n\nlisa lerer\n\nShe tells me that she called in sick to work, that she was sobbing uncontrollably.\n\ntara reade It\u2019s like I just didn\u2019t want it to have happened. It just didn\u2019t happen.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does she say happens in the days and maybe even weeks after this alleged incident?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo she tells me eventually she does go back to work. And when she does, she says that she tells her immediate supervisor, who\u2019s Biden\u2019s personal secretary, as well as two top staffers in the office \u2014 the deputy chief of staff and the chief of staff \u2014 that she feels uncomfortable around Joe Biden. She never mentions the alleged assault, but she talks more about feeling uncomfortable with him touching her shoulders or tangling his hands in her hair. And in her telling, the staff don\u2019t really do anything about that. In fact, she feels that they kind of penalize her for bringing that forward. She says they strip her of one of her duties, which is supervising the interns. She says they put her in a windowless office, far from the rest of the staff. So at some point, she says that she goes to a Senate personnel office and files a formal complaint.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does she say was in this complaint?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nShe said that complaint really detailed the harassment and what she saw as retaliation in the office. But she believes that that forum eventually was returned to Biden\u2019s office, which would have been a flouting of what the official protocol was at that time. And once that complaint was returned to Biden\u2019s office, she says, she was given a month to find a new job, and basically eased out of her position. And so she started looking for another position on Capitol Hill, she says, and never ended up getting hired or finding anything.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Lisa, once Tara Reade has given you this account of an alleged attack, what do you do next?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo at this point, she\u2019s told me a lot of information. And some really detailed information too. So I start thinking about what can be corroborated, what we can show to be true and what we can show to be not true. And one thing that Tara mentions to me is that at the time, she had called a friend and told her the whole story. So I tracked down the friend.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd in large part, she corroborates the story that Tara had told me. Tara tells me she also told her mother. Her mother is deceased, so she can\u2019t be called. And she told a version of her story to her brother, though not all the details. So I start trying to track down her brother. And she tells me she told a friend in 2008, after Joe Biden had been picked as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. She had told a version of this story to that friend, without all the details, but that something had happened to her. So I tracked down that friend, and she confirms that account and some of the things that Tara tells me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhere does that leave you?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo it leaves us with something, but certainly not enough to corroborate this entire story. We really only have the one friend with the full story, and everyone else is just giving us bits and pieces. So that\u2019s not the kind of full corroboration that you\u2019re looking for as a journalist, when you\u2019re trying to confirm really serious allegations and also really politically explosive allegations. But at this point, it\u2019s time to turn to the Biden side of things. So along with my colleague Sydney Ember, we start looking at who we can talk to. And we start by calling the three top staffers in the office at the time that Tara had mentioned she had spoken with, and she had raised those complaints of harassment to. All three of them say that a woman named Tara Reade never approached them with these kind of allegations, and two of them said they didn\u2019t remember her at all even working in the office.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo just to be clear, the three people that Tara Reade said she went to and told of Biden\u2019s behavior that made her uncomfortable, pretty senior people in his office, they say they have no recollection of that ever happening?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nExactly. They have no recollection. And a lot of the former staffers are mystified by her account too. They don\u2019t remember anything like this, or even the hint of anything like this. So they \u2014 when Sydney and I call them, they\u2019re trying to reconcile themselves her story with what they remember from working in that office. A lot of them didn\u2019t want to talk on the record. One who did said that at the time, you knew who the good guys and bad guys were on the Senate. The places where \u2014 offices where women would and would not want to work, and she described Biden as one of the good guys.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nSo after that, we reached out to another group of people, which is the interns. And that\u2019s because Tara had told me that she supervised the interns, and that she shared an office with these interns. So I reached two of them, and they both tell me that they\u2019d never heard of anything, never saw anything like the kind of harassment and assault Tara had been alleging. But that they did remember midway through their internship, sometime in April, she had been suddenly removed as their boss. And they never knew why, and they never saw her again. So amid all this confusion, I remember that there\u2019s one thing that really could cut through all this and clarify exactly what did or did not happen.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd that\u2019s this complaint that Tara had told me she filed in 1993 with the Senate office \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nlisa lerer\n\n\u2014 and that someone had written down. So we start trying to track down that complaint. And we call the Federal Office of Personnel Management, and they tell us to file a Freedom of Information request, which would take months, if not years. And anyhow, we don\u2019t really know exactly what we\u2019re asking for, because she doesn\u2019t remember the name of the office where she filed this complaint.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWe call over to the Senate and we\u2019re able to get some employment records, but not this complaint. So we basically look for this document and come up empty. It\u2019s unfindable in the end.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat about other aspects of Reade\u2019s life that might feel relevant? I mean, possible political affiliations or motivations. How do you begin to think and report on those?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, so one thing that we want to be really sure of is that she is who she says she is. And that this isn\u2019t someone in the midst of a heated presidential campaign \u2014 that\u2019s only, of course, going to get more heated by all expectations \u2014 that is trying to push an agenda, or possibly pull a fast one on the media to try to get claims that are untrue out there in the public. So I really talked to her a lot about her political affiliation. She describes herself as a third-generation Democrat, but walks me through the fact that she liked Marianne Williamson. She really liked Elizabeth Warren. and when California voted in the primary over Super Tuesday, she backed Bernie Sanders. But she insists that her motivation for this is not political, even though I had watched as supporters of Sanders and supporters of President Trump, really, are the ones pushing this allegation out there on social media, and really keeping the drumbeat up for people to investigate it. So that\u2019s one concern. And there is this other unusual detail.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is what?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, she had written a fair amount in Medium posts and on Twitter about her support for Russia and her respect for Vladimir Putin. And so we read through all those Medium posts. Some of them had been pulled down off the internet, but we found them. We looked through those old Twitter posts, and we really tried to investigate whether there could be some kind of nefarious agenda there. And she says that she was misguided. Tara Reade says that she had been working on a novel \u2014 she\u2019s not anymore \u2014 about Russia, and this was all part of her research. And she says that she doesn\u2019t have any respect for Vladimir Putin now, has never been to Russia. So we decide that that\u2019s not so disqualifying that it prevents us from putting a version of her story in the paper.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how are you thinking about everything that you have reported at this point? And I assume, in consultation with your editors, how are you planning to proceed?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, one thing we know is that we can\u2019t corroborate her story beyond the two friends and her brother.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWe know we can\u2019t find any documents, and we know that everyone who worked for Joe Biden is denying that anything like this ever happened, or could have happened.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nAnd we also know one other thing. And this is really important. As far as we\u2019ve learned in our reporting, there is no pattern of this kind of behavior from Joe Biden. What we had seen a year ago was a very different thing. It was touching in public, rubbing of shoulders, or maybe touching of hair that made some women feel uncomfortable. This is an allegation of a sexual assault. Those things are not at all similar. And in fact, what Tara Reade is alleging is a fairly singular act, as far as we know. But the Democratic Party, they\u2019ve really set a very high standard for taking these cases seriously, for taking allegations of sexual abuse seriously. Even Joe Biden has taken a strong position on this, and it\u2019s worth remembering the Kavanaugh hearings. And one thing that Joe Biden said when that was all going on was this, he said: \u201cFor a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it\u2019s been made worse or better over time. But nobody fails to understand that this is like jumping into a cauldron.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo it\u2019s Biden himself saying, essentially, believe women.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right. Biden essentially saying, believe women. And I think that explains part of the approach to these allegations that you\u2019ve seen from his campaign. Joe Biden himself has not spoken about them at all, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been asked directly, although I suppose that could come. But his campaign has been very careful in all their public statements to say that they believe women, that they think coming out like this is a credible thing to do. But in this case, they say the allegations are false. But they\u2019re really walking a tightrope when they talk about this politically, with many in the base of the Democratic Party.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, help me understand that. I mean, with all that history in mind that you just described, of the Democratic Party setting such a high standard for itself \u2014 and Biden himself, the presumptive Democratic nominee, saying, believe women \u2014 how is the Democratic establishment, how is the Democratic Party responding to what Tara Reade has alleged happened to her?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nThey\u2019re not responding. Nobody in the Democratic establishment, elected officials, party leaders, has discussed this at all.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy do you think that is? I mean, is that a function of the conflicting information here? Is that party loyalty to the de facto nominee? Is that about the fact that there is just one of these accusations, not a pattern, as you just said? How do you explain that?\n\nlisa lerer\n\nWell, honestly, I think it\u2019s some of all of that. When I talk to people who are close to Joe Biden, and I\u2019ve now talked to quite a lot of them, they say that this is something that\u2019s just so completely out of character for him. They describe a man who\u2019s fiercely devoted to his wife and his kids. That he would spend a lot of time focusing on when he could get the quickest train, the soonest train, home to Delaware so he could see them. And they just cannot reconcile these allegations that are out with the guy that they have known for all these decades. So they say they can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true. But when you look at the political calendar, we\u2019re in the spring of an election year, Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. So you have to figure that many, many Democrats also just don\u2019t want this to be true.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLisa, thank you very much.\n\nlisa lerer\n\nThanks for having me.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders) So today, I am asking all Americans \u2014 I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, Joe Biden was endorsed by his former rival, Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Well, Bernie I want to thank you for that. It\u2019s a big deal. I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (emmanuel macron) [SPEAKING FRENCH]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, France said it would extend a nationwide lockdown until the middle of May. Britain was expected to extend its lockdown. And Russia\u2019s president offered his darkest assessment yet of the virus\u2019s impact there.\n\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring a meeting with his advisors, Vladimir Putin said, quote, \u201cWe see the situation changing daily. And unfortunately, not for the better.\u201d\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Let me welcome my fellow governors, who are on the telephone, who you\u2019ll hear from in a moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the U.S., two groups of governors \u2014 one on the east coast, the other on the west coast \u2014 said they would decide regionally when and how to reopen their state\u2019s economies, and emphasized that they would not do so until experts and data showed that it would be safe.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Again, we anticipate different facts, different circumstances for different states, different parts of states. But let\u2019s be smart and let\u2019s be cooperative. And let\u2019s learn from one another.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring a conference call, the governors, including Tom Wolfe of Pennsylvania, said that it was their role, not the federal government\u2019s, to make that decision.\n\narchived recording (tom wolfe) Well, seeing as how had the responsibility for closing the state down, I think we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nA few hours later, President Trump was asked about the governor\u2019s announcement.\n\narchived recording Just to clarify your understanding of your authority, vis-\u00e0-vis governors, if a governor issued a stay at home \u2014 archived recording (donald trump) You say my authority. The president\u2019s authority. Not mine, because it\u2019s not me. This is \u2014 when somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe president insisted that the decision was his.\n\narchived recording Your authority\u2019s total? archived recording (donald trump) It\u2019s total. It\u2019s total. And the governors know that. archived recording So if a \u2014 archived recording (donald trump) The governors know that. You know, you have a couple of bands of \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me.\n\nmichael barbaro",
