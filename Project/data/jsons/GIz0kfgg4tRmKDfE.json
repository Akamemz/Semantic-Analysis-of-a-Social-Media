A state official called Kapoor the next day and told him to get tested at the Agra District Hospital .\nHe was positive - and so were his father , mother , son , wife and brother .

On April 11 , Lav Agarwal , a senior official in India 's federal health ministry , held up Agra as an example of how India was working `` to defeat the pandemic . ''\nBut a resurgence was already in the works .

Eventually , 104 people from this group tested positive in Agra .\nThe effort was helped by the nationwide lockdown on March 25 that stopped all public transport , shut businesses and kept residents at home .\n`` Without a lockdown , we could not have done anything , '' Singh said .\nBy early April , a patient linked to the Tablighi group showed up at an Agra hospital and later tested positive for COVID-19 , officials said . The disease spread rapidly among patients and staff who went on to infect their families and relatives . New cases also popped up in Agra 's other healthcare facilities .\nWorst hit was Paras Hospital , the source of at least 92 coronavirus cases , Singh said . One staff member infected 14 others in a two-room home , he said .

Late last month , a chart tracking contacts of positive patients linked to the facility still stood next to Singh 's desk .\nAgra now has about 600 coronavirus cases and 14 deaths , according to local authorities . As of the end of April , there were 39 infection hotspots and tests had been conducted on 6,848 samples , with some people tested multiple times .\nSingh said he is confident the city will defeat the virus , thanks in part to its aggressive contact-tracing system .\n`` The good part is that for all the cases , we know the source , '' he said .\nStill , eradicating COVID-19 in Agra 's crowded neighbourhoods will remain difficult , particularly without testing large groups of people , said Dr Rajib Dasgupta , an epidemiologist who teaches at New Delhi 's Jawaharlal Nehru University .\n`` Even within a containment zone , for some conceivable time , it 's not going to go away very rapidly , '' said Dasgupta .",
