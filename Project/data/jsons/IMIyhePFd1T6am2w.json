    "content": "\u201c In 2014 , [ Colorado ] became the first state to impose its own regulation on methane emissions , which are 25 times worse for climate change than carbon dioxide , and we did it by working with both environmentalists and industry . We implemented new standards for low-emission vehicles and expanded Colorado \u2019 s renewable energy standard , doubling the goal for rural electric producers . We also built public support for unprecedented expansions of light rail and the retrofitting of buildings to save energy . At the same time , we created more than 10,000 clean-energy jobs \u2014 just as we can create millions of clean-energy jobs across the country if we take the right steps. \u201d John Hickenlooper , Washington Post\nSenator Doug Jones ( D-AL ) writes , \u201c This week , the Senate voted on one idea : the Green New Deal . Unfortunately , it was too broad and went too far . It tried to address such a diverse set of problems facing our country \u2014climate change , lack of access to health care , and stagnant wages , for example \u2014that it was not practical and collapsed under its own weight . I voted against it for this reason\u2026 \u201c Our leaders and the media spend too much time bickering about unrealistic ideas and not enough time talking about real steps we can take to protect our environment and grow our economy . While the Green New Deal is not a feasible way to move forward , I hope we can come together at every level of government and industry and find a path forward to secure our future. \u201d Sen. Doug Jones , al.com\nSome note that \u201c Tuesday \u2019 s Senate vote rejecting the Green New Deal masks a striking reality : In a matter of months , liberal activists have upended the conversation about climate change among both parties in Washington \u2026 even as Republicans seek to exploit that divide , many GOP lawmakers are offering climate solutions of their own . And few besides President Donald Trump still dispute that the changing climate is a problem. \u201d Zack Colman and Anthony Adragna , Politico\n\u201c McConnell tried to rush the # GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing . The real question we should be asking : Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change ? \u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , Twitter\n\u201c During floor debate ahead of a vote on the Green New Deal , Sen. Mike Lee ( R-Utah ) told his colleagues that if they really want to address environmental concerns they \u2019 ll encourage people to couple off and have more babies\u2026 This recommendation , to add more people to the planet , doesn \u2019 t track with science or reason . A 2017 research article determined that one way an individual could contribute to eliminating greenhouse gases is to have one fewer child .

But for all its flaws , it is a more promising first step than the Republican leaders \u2019 chosen strategy of inaction and sneering denial. \u201d Michelle Cottle , The New York Times\n\u201c McConnell wanted to put moderate Senate Democrats on the spot by making them publicly vote yes or no on the resolution .
