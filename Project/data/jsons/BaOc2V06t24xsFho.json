Describing the thrust of a speech by the UN Secretary-General, Ban-Ki Moon, in 2011, he writes, \"The world is dying\". The culprit, he argues, is metabolic syndrome \u2013 the term for a suite of ailments including heart disease, diabetes, cancer and dementia \u2013 and he pushes hard on the big changes we must make in order to turn the situation around.
