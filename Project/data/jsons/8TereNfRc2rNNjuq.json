    "content": "Rand Paul is just hilariously trolling Republicans now -- and inadvertently revealing the two words behind the GOP 's biggest lie Kentucky senator seemed adrift before Tuesday 's debate , but he seems to have found his cause , and it 's a good one\nFox Business 's Tuesday night Republican debate was equal parts thuddingly dull and thoroughly truth-averse , save for one interesting moment when Rand Paul took a moment to troll Marco Rubio about defense spending , and not just because Paul managed to unnerve the usually slick as a snail Rubio . Admitting that we spend a lot of money and that 's not very `` fiscally conservative '' is a third rail in Republican politics and yet there Paul was , looking alive , hollering , `` We need a safe country , but did you know , we spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined . I want a strong national defense , but I don \u2019 t want us to be bankrupt . ''\nIt was n't like he declared himself an atheist or anything , but in a debate format geared towards maximum tedium , it was pretty entertaining . Indeed , for people who do n't live in the conservative bubble , it helped make Rand Paul seem like the sanest person on the stage last night , though that 's like a 2-year-old beating a bunch of newborns in a foot race . But the audience was n't really having it . Paul got a smattering of applause , but it 's not clear if it 's because anyone agreed with him or that they just liked that someone was bothering to entertain them for a moment .\nAt this point , the only reasonable cause Paul has to run for president is that he hates Republicans and enjoys exposing , every chance he gets , how they are a bunch of lying hypocrites with this entire `` small government '' talking point . It ca n't be that he wants to win , since trolling people about their delusions is not known as a way to win friends .\nTo hear conservatives talk , this principle of `` small government '' is sacred , inviolable and the supposed Democratic opposition to it stems no doubt from their ideological commitment to evil . Why we are supposed to love `` small government '' is rarely explained . Like daylight savings time or that rule about not taking the Lord 's name in vain , it just is , and not for we mere mortals to question .\nIf you do start to question it , it becomes immediately apparent that finding a Republican who legitimately wants to shrink the size of the government , on principle , is harder than finding a Republican who has warm things to say about Planned Parenthood . On the contrary , one strong consistent trend over the past century is that Republican presidential administrations contribute more to the federal debt than Democratic ones . Even though almost no one knows it , deficit spending under President Obama has been consistently dropping , now shrunk by a $ 1 trillion compared to what the federal government had to spend to recover from the Bush recession . Principled adherence to `` small government '' would simply not lead to voting Republican , if only out of fear that all that war-mongering rhetoric would lead to more expensive adventure wars like the previous President Bush gave us .\nAnd , as Paul compulsively points out , this is partially because Republicans love the military . Watching Tuesday 's debate , you would get the strong impression that cutting even one dollar of military spending is the equivalent of sending a cruise ship full of free weapons to ISIS and bringing them over to the United States to be let loose in Miami . When you actually start to prod conservatives , you will quickly discover that `` small government '' is n't a principle at all , and does n't even touch the truly sacred principles like profligate defense spending .\nThat 's because `` small government '' is and always will be a cover story for the real principle at stake , which is halting government activities aimed at ameliorating injustice and inequality . If you listen carefully to any Republican who is not Rand Paul , you 'll see that the concept of `` big government '' only encompasses two ideas : Regulations on business that protect workers or the environment and social spending .\nTo be clear , even the category of `` social spending '' that qualifies as `` big government '' is exceedingly limited . Anything spent on middle class or wealthy people is not `` big government , '' but if the money goes to help lower income people -- -especially if they are perceived as disproportionately people of color -- -then all hell breaks loose . In practice , this means that Republican voters do n't treat Medicare and Social Security or other social safety net programs for the middle class as `` big government '' . In numbers , that means that only about 10 % of federal welfare spending is considered `` big government '' by your average Republican politician .\nConsider : The term `` big government '' does n't cover Social Security , which is a quarter of the federal budget . But it is used frequently to slur `` Obamaphones '' -- -a program that provides low cost cell phones to low income people -- -which costs our federal government $ 0 , because it 's paid for directly by telecom companies and not through federal taxes .\nAnd , of course , `` big government '' is rarely , if ever , used by conservatives to slur unnecessary regulations passed on abortion clinics for the sole purpose of reducing abortion access , or to raise the alarm about police overreach , such as `` stop and frisk '' .\n`` Big '' and `` small '' government are never defined by expenditures or by levels of government intrusiveness . The terms instead reflect whose interests are being served . Are wealthy people being served at the expense of working people , or is white privilege being protected ? Then it 's `` small '' government . Are underprivileged people getting a leg up or are workers being protected ? Then it 's `` big '' government . In conservative parlance , it 's `` big '' government to tell Hobby Lobby they ca n't interfere with their employee 's reproductive choices , but it 's `` small '' government if legislators pass a bunch of laws interfering with women 's reproductive choices . The consistent theme here is not the actual size of the government , but whether the goal -- -interfering with women 's reproductive choices -- -is being advanced .\nNone of this is new or particularly hard to figure out . Which is why it remains such a mystery that Rand Paul is running for president . Surely he must know that `` small government '' is a code term for `` squash the little guy '' and not an actual declaration of principles about government spending and overreach . You ca n't spend more than five minutes around Republicans without seeing that quite clearly . Nor does he really articulate why you should want a literal small government if it 's not to advance the `` squash the little guy '' principle . There is no converting people to his point of view , since `` small government '' does n't appeal as a principle without this overarching need to reassert unjust power systems .
