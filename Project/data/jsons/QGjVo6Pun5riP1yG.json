    "content": "Indeed , national Republicans have done far worse than simply march along to Mr. Trump \u2019 s beat . Their defense of him is imbued with an ugliness , a meanness and a willingness to attack and slander those who have shed blood for our country , who have dedicated their lives and careers to its defense and its security , and whose job is to preserve the nation \u2019 s status as a beacon of hope .\nCongressional Republicans have embraced and copied Mr. Trump \u2019 s cruelty and defended and even adopted his corruption . Mr. Trump and his enablers have abandoned conservatism and longstanding Republican principles and replaced them with Trumpism , an empty faith led by a bogus prophet . In a recent survey , a majority of Republican voters reported that they consider Mr. Trump a better president than Lincoln .\nMr. Trump and his fellow travelers daily undermine the proposition we as a people have a responsibility and an obligation to continually bend the arc of history toward justice . They mock our belief in America as something more meaningful than lines on a map .\nOur peril far outstrips any past differences : It has arrived at our collective doorstep , and we believe there is no other choice . We sincerely hope , but are not optimistic , that some of those Republicans charged with sitting as jurors in a likely Senate impeachment trial will do likewise .\nAmerican men and women stand ready around the globe to defend us and our way of life . We must do right by them and ensure that the country for which they daily don their uniform deserves their protection and their sacrifice .\nWe are reminded of Dan Sickles , an incompetent 19th-century New York politician . On July 2 , 1863 , his blundering nearly ended the United States .\n( Sickles \u2019 s greatest previous achievement had been fatally shooting his wife \u2019 s lover across the street from the White House and getting himself elected to Congress . Even his most fervent admirers could not have imagined that one day , far in the future , another incompetent New York politician , a president , would lay claim to that legacy by saying he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it . )",
