Now it is increasing. Note: Gray areas indicate recessions. 2018 GDP uses a projection provided by the Treasury and Office of Management and Budget. For each selected year, the unemployment rate in September is provided. Wage growth is calculated by the change in average hourly earnings in September from a year earlier of total private production and nonsupervisory employees. The Treasury's fiscal years begin on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30. Before fiscal 1997, the federal fiscal year began on July 1 and ended on June 30. We have omitted the transition quarter between July and September 1976.
