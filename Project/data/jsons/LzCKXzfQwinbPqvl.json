And it might not be a bad strategy , if a recent poll is any indication .\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey , 71 percent of voters said they are opposed to overturning Roe , the landmark 1973 case protecting the right to an abortion . That \u2019 s a remarkable figure considering how polarizing abortion is in American political debate . Only 23 percent of voters said they want to see Roe overturned .\nSupport for Roe v. Wade is overwhelming among Democrats and independents : 88 percent and 76 percent , respectively . But even a majority of Republicans \u2014 52 percent \u2014 don \u2019 t want to see the court ruling overturned .\nThat \u2019 s a gap that \u2019 s been widening since 1991 , according to the Wall Street Journal . Margins are also opening up among voters who say they support pro-abortion rights candidates : 44 percent of voters , versus 26 percent who preferred anti-abortion candidates .\nThe WSJ/NBC News poll questioned 900 registered voters from July 15 to 18 , with a margin of error of 3.27 percent .\nThis latest survey mirrors other polling that suggests the majority of Americans do not want to roll back abortion rights \u2014 even as Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination to the Supreme Court makes it more likely than it has been in decades that Roe ( and Casey v. Planned Parenthood , the 1992 decision that partly affirmed Roe ) could be reversed or gutted . Justice Anthony Kennedy , whom Kavanaugh would replace , served as the conservative swing vote on the Court , but he often sided with the liberal wing when it came to social issues , including abortion access .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Dylan Matthews wrote , Kavanaugh \u2019 s presence on the Court could definitely put Roe at risk :\nKavanaugh will pretend this isn \u2019 t the case .
