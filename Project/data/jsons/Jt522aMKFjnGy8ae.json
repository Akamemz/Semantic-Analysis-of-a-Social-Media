Bob Corker says the only pledge he will keep is his oath of office . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says no one in his home state of Virginia is talking about what leaders in Washington refer to simply as `` The Pledge , '' a Norquist invention that dates to 1986 . Georgia Sen.

And while GOP leaders insist they still do n't want to see taxes go up , the reality of a nation in a debt crisis is forcing some to moderate their opposition to any movement on how much Americans pay to fund their government . Republican legislators and Democratic President Barack Obama 's White House are haggling vigorously as they look for ways to reach agreement on detailed tax adjustments and spending cuts before automatic , blunt-force changes occur at the new year .\n`` Oh , I signed it , '' Sen.
