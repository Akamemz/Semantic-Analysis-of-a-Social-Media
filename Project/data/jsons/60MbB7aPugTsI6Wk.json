    "content": "President Obama came armed with an arsenal of biting one-liners at the final presidential debate Monday night , trying to paint Mitt Romney as `` all over the map '' on foreign affairs , but he encountered a Republican rival who returned fire in moderation -- at times chiding the president for \u201c weakness \u201d on the world stage but also finding common ground with the man he \u2019 s been running against for nearly two years .\nThe debate in Boca Raton , Fla. , the last before a feverish two-week blitz of campaigning , was a departure from the candidates \u2019 previous bout .
