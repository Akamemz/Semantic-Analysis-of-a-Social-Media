We are living off the investments that were made by our parents \u2019 and grandparents \u2019 generations . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s plan , by contrast , doesn \u2019 t offer any \u201c credible solutions to the very real economic challenges we face \u201d , she said .\n\u201c He would give trillions in tax cuts to corporations \u2026 that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education , healthcare and environmental protection , \u201d Clinton said .\nClinton \u2019 s campaign said her plan would add more than 10m jobs across the US . It would include employment opportunities for outgoing prison inmates and youth , as well as billions of dollars for infrastructure projects . Despite embracing a more upbeat view of the nation \u2019 s outlook compared to her opponent , Clinton noted that income inequality has continued to increase in recent years .\n\u201c It is just too hard to get ahead today , \u201d she said . \u201c But there are commonsense things that your government can do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed . Why don \u2019 t we do it ? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s 50-minute speech in south-east Michigan followed an economic policy rollout on Monday by her opponent \u2013 whose remarks in Detroit were interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters . Trump \u2019 s subdued speech ( by his standards ) took repeated shots at Clinton , in particular by saying her \u201c failed \u201d economic agenda is indicative of problems in Detroit , which emerged from municipal bankruptcy just under two years ago .\nThe former secretary of state vehemently pushed back against Trump on Thursday , saying his plan is a rehashed playbook of trickle-down economics , and will only benefit millionaires and billionaires . In particular , she dubbed one aspect of her opponent \u2019 s plan as the \u201c Trump loophole \u201d : a proposal to slash income taxes for corporations by more than half .\n\u201c It would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate in income for many of his companies , \u201d she said . \u201c He \u2019 d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families. \u201d One analyst , she noted , said Trump \u2019 s plan would be a \u201c really nice deal \u2013 for Donald Trump \u201d .\nTrump \u2019 s proposal to eliminate the estate tax , which applies to estates larger than $ 5.45m for individuals , would also shore up his family \u2019 s finances , Clinton said .\n\u201c That alone would save the Trump family $ 4bn , \u201d she claimed . \u201c It would do nothing for 99.8 % of Americans . So they \u2019 d get a $ 4bn tax cut , and 99.8 % of Americans would get nothing . Just think of what we could do with those four billion . \u201d\nThe Democratic nominee \u2019 s speech didn \u2019 t highlight new significant economic proposals , instead taking aim at Trump \u2019 s pledge for immense deregulation , including a temporary moratorium on federal agency rules . She said Trump \u2019 s plan would eliminate regulations that \u201c stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe , and the water we drink \u201d . In Michigan , the city of Flint has been reeling from a two-year water contamination crisis , an issue Clinton has repeatedly highlighted on the campaign trail this year .\n\u201c Now there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and powerful because , somehow , he \u2019 s really on the side of the little guy , \u201d she said . \u201c Don \u2019 t believe it . Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable . \u201d\nShe also hit back on Trump \u2019 s intense criticism to US trade deals supported by Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton .\n\u201c It is too often that past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that did not pan out , \u201d she said . But the answer , she added , isn \u2019 t to \u201c rant or rave and cut ourselves off from the world \u201d .\n\u201c That would end up killing even more jobs ; the answer is to finally make trade work for us , not against us , \u201d she said . \u201c So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this : I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages , including the Trans-Pacific Partnership . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s trade remarks were , perhaps , the latest in a move to appeal to progressives who remain skeptical of her policy stances , following the exit of Senator Bernie Sanders from the Democratic presidential race . In public , Clinton \u2019 s support for the TPP has wavered since last fall , when she broke from the Obama administration and came out against the 12-country deal . Still , last month , Clinton ally and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe said he believes the candidate will support TPP , albeit with some changes .\nPolitical observers viewed the stop in Macomb County \u2013 famous for producing so-called \u201c Reagan Democrats \u201d , who propelled the former president \u2019 s candidacy in the 1980s \u2013 as a sign of Clinton mounting the beginnings of a competitive campaign in Michigan .\nClinton showed signs of weakness in the primary , when Sanders dramatically won by a nail-biting 1.5 % . But local officials believe that , despite an expected close race in Michigan , Clinton has turned a corner .\nEd Bruley , chairman of the Macomb County Democratic party , told the Detroit News that Clinton was \u201c outworked in the primary but she \u2019 s making the right moves now \u201d by focusing on the middle class and economic policies .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s going to be close . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a walk-away , \u201d he told the newspaper of the Clinton-Trump race in Macomb County . \u201c But I think Clinton is doing the right stuff . By coming here , she \u2019 s demonstrating that she \u2019 s committed. \u201d Clinton opened up a near double-digit lead on Trump in recent state polls .\nClinton \u2019 s state campaign shouldn \u2019 t relax a moment , though , said Michigan \u2019 s former Democratic governor James Blanchard .\n\u201c I once won an election by 70 % and I didn \u2019 t know I was going to do that until the day after . I once lost an election by a quarter of a point and everyone told me I was going to win by 20 . So you really have to be careful on polls , \u201d Blanchard said .\nThe former governor and US congressman said the close primary race in Michigan with Sanders was a \u201c good wake-up call \u201d for the Clinton campaign .\n\u201c They didn \u2019 t really spend any time here , \u201d Blanchard said . \u201c I think the polls , again the polls showed a big lead .
