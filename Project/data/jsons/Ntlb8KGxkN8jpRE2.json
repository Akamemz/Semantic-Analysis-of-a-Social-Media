    "content": "In the end , the story told by the two articles of impeachment approved on Friday morning by the House Judiciary Committee is short , simple and damning : President Donald Trump abused the power of his office by strong-arming Ukraine , a vulnerable ally , holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid until it agreed to help him influence the 2020 election by digging up dirt on a political rival .\nWhen caught in the act , he rejected the very idea that a president could be required by Congress to explain and justify his actions , showing \u201c unprecedented , categorical and indiscriminate defiance \u201d in the face of multiple subpoenas . He made it impossible for Congress to carry out fully its constitutionally mandated oversight role , and , in doing so , he violated the separation of powers , a safeguard of the American republic .\nTo quote from the articles , \u201c President Trump , by such conduct , has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office , and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule of law . \u201d\nThe case now moves to the full House of Representatives , which on Wednesday will decide , for just the third time in the nation \u2019 s history , whether to impeach a president .\nTo resist the pull of partisanship , Republicans and Democrats alike ought to ask themselves the same question : Would they put up with a Democratic president using the power of the White House this way ? Then they should consider the facts , the architecture and aspirations of the Constitution and the call of history . In that light , there can be only one responsible judgment : to cast a vote to impeach , to send a message not only to this president but to future ones .\nBy stonewalling as no previous president has , Donald Trump has left Congress with no choice but to press ahead to a Senate trial . The president insists he is innocent of any wrongdoing , yet he refuses to release any administration documents or allow any administration officials to testify \u2014 though , if his assertions are in fact true , those officials would presumably exonerate him . He refused to present any defense before the House whatsoever , asserting a form of monarchical immunity that Congress can not let stand .\nIt \u2019 s regrettable that the House moved as fast as it did , without working further through the courts and through other means to hear from numerous crucial witnesses . But Democratic leaders have a point when they say they can \u2019 t afford to wait , given the looming electoral deadline and Mr. Trump \u2019 s pattern of soliciting foreign assistance for his campaigns . Even after his effort to extract help from Ukraine was revealed , the president publicly called on China to investigate his rival . Asked as recently as October what he hoped the Ukrainians would do in response to his infamous July 25 call with their president , Mr. Trump declared : \u201c Well , I would think that , if they were honest about it , they \u2019 d start a major investigation into the Bidens . It \u2019 s a very simple answer . \u201d\nBarring the persuasive defense that Mr. Trump has so far declined even to attempt , that simple answer sounds like a textbook example of an impeachable offense , as the nation \u2019 s framers envisioned it .\nA president \u201c might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression , \u201d James Madison said of the need for an impeachment clause . \u201c He might betray his trust to foreign powers . \u201d\nMadison and his fellow framers understood that elections \u2014 which , under normal circumstances , are the essence of democratic self-government \u2014 could not serve their purpose if a president was determined to cheat to win .\nAs the constitutional scholar Noah Feldman testified before the Judiciary Committee last week , \u201c Without impeachment , the president would have been an elected monarch . With impeachment , the president was bound to the rule of law . \u201d\nAt the same time , the framers were well aware of the dangers inherent in impeachment . That \u2019 s why they made it a two-step process : First is the House \u2019 s vote on impeachment , which is akin to an indictment and requires only a majority to pass . Second is a trial in the Senate , which decides the president \u2019 s ultimate fate , and thus has a much higher bar to clear \u2014 two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove the president from office .\nSo far , Republican legislators have shown little sign of treating this constitutional process with the seriousness it demands .\nBy stonewalling as no previous president has , Donald Trump has left Congress with no choice but to press ahead to a Senate trial .\nInstead , they have been working overtime to abet the president \u2019 s wrongdoing . They have spread toxic misinformation and conspiracy theories to try to justify his actions and raged about the unfairness of the inquiry , complaining that Democrats have been trying to impeach Mr. Trump since he took office .\nNo doubt some Democrats were too eager to resort to impeachment before it became unavoidable . Mr. Trump has been committing arguably impeachable offenses since the moment he entered the Oval Office , including his acceptance of foreign money at his many businesses ; his violations of campaign-finance law in paying hush money to a woman who claimed to have had a sexual affair with him ; and , of course , his obstructions of justice in the Russia investigation , which were documented extensively by the special counsel , Robert Mueller .\nDemocrats could have pursued impeachment in any or all of these cases , but for various reasons decided not to . That changed in September , when a whistle-blower \u2019 s complaint , initially suppressed by the Justice Department , revealed the outline of Mr. Trump \u2019 s Ukraine scheme . That made it impossible to ignore the president \u2019 s lawlessness because it sounded an alarm that he was seeking to subvert the next election , depriving the voters of their right to check his behavior .\nThe Republicans \u2019 most common defenses of Mr. Trump \u2019 s behavior fall flat in the face of the evidence .\nThere is , above all , the summary of the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky , the Ukrainian president . Mr. Trump still insists that summary exonerates him . It doesn \u2019 t \u2014 which is why White House officials promptly locked it in a special computer system .\nThen there is the sworn testimony of multiple government officials , including several appointed by Mr. Trump himself , all of whom confirmed the essential story line : For all the recent claims about his piety regarding Ukrainian corruption , Mr. Trump did not \u201c give a shit about Ukraine. \u201d He only wanted the \u201c deliverable \u201d \u2014 the announcement of an investigation into the Bidens , and also into a debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election .\nThe argument that Mr. Trump cared about anything other than hurting Joe Biden and helping himself is undercut by several facts . Even though calling on the Ukrainians to fight corruption was part of his prepared talking points , he never mentioned the subject in his calls with Mr. Zelensky ; he also didn \u2019 t hold up the military aid in 2017 or 2018 , even though everyone knew about Hunter Biden \u2019 s Ukraine connection at the time . ( What changed this year ? Joe Biden emerged as his leading Democratic opponent . ) By the time Mr. Trump intervened to block the money for Ukraine , the Defense Department had already certified that Ukraine had made enough progress fighting corruption to qualify for this year \u2019 s funds .\nRepublicans and Democrats ought to ask themselves the same question : Would they put up with a Democratic president using the power of the White House this way ?\nWithout any substantive defense of Mr. Trump \u2019 s behavior , several Republicans have taken to arguing that he committed no actual crime , and so can \u2019 t be impeached for \u201c high crimes and misdemeanors. \u201d Putting aside a strong case that Mr. Trump has , in fact , broken at least one law , this isn \u2019 t how impeachment works . \u201c High crimes \u201d refers to severe violations of the public trust by a high-ranking official , not literal crimes . A president can commit a technical crime that doesn \u2019 t violate the public trust ( say , jaywalking ) , and he can commit an impeachable offense that is found nowhere in the federal criminal code ( like abuse of power ) .\nRepublicans \u2019 sole remaining argument is : \u201c So what ? It wasn \u2019 t that big a deal. \u201d Or , as acting White House chief of staff , Mick Mulvaney said in October , \u201c Get over it. \u201d This stance at least has the virtue of acknowledging the president \u2019 s vice , but that doesn \u2019 t make it O.K .\nAssuming Mr. Trump is impeached , the case will go to the Senate , where he will have the chance \u2014 on far more friendly territory \u2014 to mount the defense he refused to make to the House . Rather than withholding key witnesses , he should be demanding sworn appearances by people like Mike Pompeo , the secretary of state , and John Bolton , the former national security adviser .\nAs recently as a few weeks ago , some Republicans seemed to want to get to the bottom of things .
