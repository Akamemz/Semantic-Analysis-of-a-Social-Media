    "content": "Negotiations toward a nuclear deal between Iran and the P+5 nations ( the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , plus Germany ) will continue through June , according to reports from Lausanne , Switzerland on Tuesday . The announcement was made to satisfy the self-imposed deadline of March 31 for a provisional agreement , with \u201c technical \u201d details to be agreed by July 1 . However , major differences appear to have been redefined as \u201c technical \u201d to keep talks going .\nThe chief sticking point remains the question of what will happen to Iran \u2019 s stockpile of enriched uranium . Iran had initially agreed to export the stockpile abroad , but reversed its position at the 11th hour . In addition , Iran wants UN sanctions lifted immediately , rather than at the end of several years . The parties have not yet agreed on a system of monitoring compliance , and the U.S. appears to have given up a demand for Iran to reveal possible military dimensions ( PMDs ) of its program .\nThe announcement of a new sort of interim agreement will suit the Obama administration \u2019 s political purposes , providing a ceremonious display of diplomatic progress for domestic consumption . The real winner , however , is Iran , which will have reason to feel proud of the concessions its negotiators have won , including an apparent agreement to allow it to maintain centrifuges at the fortified underground site at Fordow . Iran will also have three more months to build its nuclear capacity .\nThe lack of a more specific agreement , however , may provide American critics of the negotiations with an opportunity to press for new legislation in Congress\u2013both for new sanctions in the event of failed talks , and for requiring any final deal to be ratified by the Senate . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the terms of the emerging deal as \u201c even worse \u201d than he had expected , and Tuesday \u2019 s deal may make the question of military force far more urgent than before .",
