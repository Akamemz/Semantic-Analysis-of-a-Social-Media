    "content": "With Israel 's final pre-election polls pointing to a difficult road for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stay in power , he spent his final days on the campaign trail throwing red meat to his base .\nPro-Likud robocalls warned Israeli voters that only Mr. Netanyahu has the strength to stand up to `` Hussein Obama . '' Campaign ads compared Israeli dock workers and regulators to Hamas militants and called his opponents tools of shadowy foreign financiers ( a strange charge given his own close ties to US casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson ) .\nBut on Monday the prime minister delivered his show stopper : Vote for me and I 'll kill what 's left of the peace process stone dead .\nThough not his precise words , that was their meaning . And this is one campaign promise that voters could probably take to the bank . If that promise helps tip the electoral balance in his favor , it would mean the road to a Palestinian state that was at the heart of the Oslo Accords signed over 20 years ago has come to a dead end .\n`` I think that anyone who moves to establish a Palestinian state and evacuate territory , gives territory away to radical Islamic attacks against Israel , '' he told NRG , a pro-settler news website owned by Mr. Adelson .\nHe warned in the interview that if the more dovish Zionist Union headed by Isaac Herzog won , the new government would `` do the bidding '' of the international community . That was code for freezing settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and focusing on a Palestinian peace deal drawn on the borders that prevailed before 1967 's Arab-Israeli war \u2013 all leading to the creation of a `` Hamastan '' in Jerusalem .\nWithout a Palestinian state and Israel 's evacuation of at least some of the settlements it has built on land captured in 1967 , what 's left of the so-called peace process becomes a farce . There simply is n't that much more to talk about .\nTo be sure , it 's a somewhat academic question at this point . There has been no process to speak of for years , US Secretary of State John Kerry 's protestations to the contrary notwithstanding . When it was announced that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was stepping down from his role as the so-called Quartet 's special envoy on Middle East peace \u2013 after 8 years on the job \u2013 it was the first he 'd been heard from on the issue in quite some time .\nWhile spending most of his tenure talking about `` transformational change '' for Palestinians through investment promotion , Mr. Blair was also tending to his growing consulting empire , whose clients include companies like JPMorgan Chase and governments like Kazakhstan and Abu Dhabi . Middle East peace , particularly the creation of the Palestinian state that the `` Quartet '' \u2013 the UN , EU , US and Russia \u2013 says is key , steadily receded from view .\nBut at least lip service was paid to that ultimate goal by all concerned \u2013 including Netanyahu . In 2009 , in a speech following President Barack Obama 's Cairo address , in which the then-new US leader spoke of a new chapter for the Palestinians , Netanyahu said as long as there were strong US security guarantees for Israel and a recognition of the Jewish state by the Palestinian Authority that `` we will be ready ... to reach a solution where a demilitarized Palestinian state exists alongside a Jewish state . ''\nIt was no mistake that one of his last campaign stops Monday was in Har Homa , a Jewish settlement of 20,000 people wedged between Jerusalem and the ancient Palestinian town of Bethlehem . Netanyahu approved construction work on Har Homa during his first term as prime minister , in 1997 . On Monday he confirmed what has long been suspected \u2013 that settlements like Har Homa were established to make any Palestinian claims on parts of Jerusalem impossible .\n`` We will preserve Jerusalem 's unity in all its parts , '' he told voters . `` We will continue to build and fortify Jerusalem so that its division wo n't be possible and it will stay united forever . ''\nThe Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas views East Jerusalem as its future capital , and that portion of the city is considered occupied by Israel under international law .\nSince the late 1990s a network of concrete walls , checkpoints , Israeli-only roads , and settlements in the West Bank has hemmed in and divided Palestinian population centers , effectively chopping into pieces the territory that was meant to be the heartland of a Palestinian state .

And Netanyahu has now promised he will never make those concessions .\nTurnout in voting Tuesday has been brisk . Haaretz reports that about 14 percent of eligible Israelis had voted by 10 AM local time , a clip 20 percent faster than in the country 's two previous elections .
