    "content": "Several media outlets reported Thursday that the U.S. now has more cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world has been hit with , ignoring the fact that numbers from the Communist Party of China \u2014 the country from where the virus originated \u2014 can not be believed or confirmed .\nRegardless , one journalist reacted to the news of America becoming the new COVID-19 epicenter by asking , `` Who 's the s * * thole country now ? ''\nOn Thursday , the New York Times reported that `` in the United States , at least 81,321 people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus , including more than 1,000 deaths \u2014 more cases than China , Italy , or any other country has seen , '' according to their own data .\nJulia Ioffe , a correspondent for GQ Magazine , posted the Times ' story and asked her 230,000-something Twitter followers in an apparent gloat : `` Who 's the s * * thole country now ? ''\nIoffe 's `` s * * thole country '' comment is in reference , of course , to a report from the Washington Post two years ago , which cited unnamed sources claiming that during a meeting about `` immigrants from Haiti , El Salvador and African countries '' President Donald Trump asked , `` Why are we having all these people from s * * thole countries come here ? ''\nMocking the United States did not go over well on Twitter for Ioffe . But her post is still proudly posted on her account .\nTurning Point USA 's Benny Johnson replied , `` People are sick and dying . Frontline medical professionals are working 24/7 . Americans are risking their lives to help each other . You are a s * * thole person . ''\nAnother Twitter user pointed to a Johns Hopkins University and World Bank graph showing that COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants indicate that Switzerland , Italy , Spain , Germany , France , Iran ( whose numbers are also disputed ) , and South Korea all showed higher case counts by that metric than the United States .\nThat same user also shared a recent Gallup poll showing that U.S. adults overwhelmingly approve of the coronavirus response by U.S. hospitals , their state governments , and their employers by more than 80 % . President Trump was given a 60 % approval rating in that poll , and Congress was at 58 % .\nOnly the media was given a negative approval rating , at 44 % .\nWe all know that the numbers from China are n't accurate , but regarding the topic of this article , it does n't matter . Cheering on an epidemic in the United States is beneath contempt .\nTrying to dunk on President Trump for clicks is one thing . It 's a popular thing to do in many circles \u2014 I can understand that , and I understand why . But using his alleged words to trash America is disgusting .\nWe need unity right now , we need encouragement , and we need optimism . We 're seeing it across our country , and there are countless stories of citizens , businesses , and organizations making enormous contributions of time and resources to stave off this epidemic and to help those impacted by it the most .\nI 'm so proud of my country , even when I 'm frustrated with its politics . And I 've been even more proud of its people during this crisis . The fact that comments like Ioffe 's are accepted in mainstream media is , to me , an indication of why the media has lost so much respect . Deservedly so .",
