Our veterans deserve the opportunity for personal and professional success long after their military service .\nFor most , that means having the opportunity to work and move up in the world , a journey that is usually undertaken not as an individual , but as a family . So our national commitment must be to make sure not only that every veteran can find a job , but also that military spouses have a fair shot at building successful careers . Doing so will not only repay a debt we owe , but also deliver enormous benefits to our entire economy .\nThe good news is that progress has been made to address veteran unemployment . From September 2013 to September 2014 the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans was cut from 10.1 percent to 6.2 percent due to both an improving jobs market , as well as focused hiring efforts .\nAs just a few examples , JPMorgan Chase and over 170 other companies work together as part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission , which is on pace to hire 200,000 veterans by the end of the year , while Starbucks committed to hiring 10,000 veterans and spouses by 2018 and is well on the way toward that goal .\nIn addition to employing veterans , it \u2019 s equally important to be aware of and bring attention to their plight as companies such as HBO have done through an effective mix of programming that spotlights their tremendous sacrifices and many contributions .\nMore must still be done . Nearly 160,000 post-9/11 veterans remain unemployed and their unemployment rate is still above the civilian rate . That is both shameful and illogical .
