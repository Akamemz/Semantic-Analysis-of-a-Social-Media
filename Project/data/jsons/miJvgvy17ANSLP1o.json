Donna Campbell shouted to a security guard , pointing to the thundering crowd in the gallery overhead that had already been screaming for more than 10 minutes .\n`` Time is running out , '' Campbell pleaded . `` I want them out of here ! ''\nIt did n't work . The noise never stopped and despite barely beating the midnight end-of-session deadline with a vote to pass the bill , Lt. Gov .

'' Democrats who urged them on called the outburst democracy in action .\nIn either point of view , a raucous crowd of chanting , singing , shouting demonstrators effectively took over the Texas Capitol and blocked a bill that abortion rights groups warned would close most abortion clinics in the state .\n`` They were asking for their voices to be heard , '' said Sen.
