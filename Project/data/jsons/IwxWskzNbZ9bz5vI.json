    "content": "President Barack Obama fumbled the ball on responding to Russian meddling during the 2016 election . That appears to be the growing consensus among Democrats . Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) , the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , mentioned last week that the Obama administration could have done more . On CNN \u2019 s GPS with Fareed Zakaria , co-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee Sen. Mark Warner ( D-VA ) , said that President Obama \u201c choked \u201d on Russia .\n\u201c Do you think that the Obama administration choked and should have done more when they knew the Russians were interfering [ in the 2016 election ] ? \u201d asked Zakaria .\nYet , the Virginia Democrat tried to offer some cover , saying that there were many threads of information coming in and no one seemed to have been able to put them together . Really ? The Washington Post \u2019 s bombshell article reported that the Obama White House knew as soon as August of 2016 that Russia was interfering , and that they feared what the Russians might do if they responded . Hence , the bunker mentality , coupled with a weak post-election response , which amounted to a slap on wrist , according to former acting CIA Director Michael Morrell . He told CBS \u2019 s Face The Nation on June 25 that the Obama administration actually did a decent job coordinating with other states to shore up security efforts with their voting systems . Yet , he noted the response to all of this was an abject failure and did nothing to deter the Russians from engaging in other interference activities in the future [ emphasis mine ] :\nI think they get a high grade , because I think they prevented this from being worse than it would have been otherwise . That 's first thing .\nThe second thing is the decision not to share fully with the American people what was happening . So , the Obama administration did not tell the American people that Putin was behind this and did not tell the American people what Putin was trying to do , hurt Hillary Clinton , support Donald Trump . That 's a big , big decision .\nYou know , the White House , I think , was exactly where David [ Ignatius of The Washington Post , another guest ] said they were , which is they did n't want to make this worse . But by not entering the playing field , they ceded it to Vladimir Putin . So , I give them a C on that , and I think historians are going to debate this for a long time .\nThe third issue is how to deter the Russians in the future from doing this again , and here I think they failed miserably . I give them an F , because the package they put together , the kicking the diplomats out , intelligence officers out , closing down a couple of compounds , putting limited sanctions on in no way -- it was a slap on the wrist to Vladimir Putin . He sees it that way . It will not deter him in the future .\nWas this an election hack ? No . The 21 election systems that were targeted were not related with vote tabulations . The vote tallies were also not altered by the Russians . Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch said no \u201c technical interference \u201d occurred on election night , and DHS did not detect any spikes in malicious cyber activity that would have suggested an attack that night either . It was an interference game mostly grounded in the peddling of fake news by state-funded media outlets and social media trolls\u2014and those fake news stories played no pivotal role in the election . Just like with Ukraine , Obama virtually did nothing with Russia , a nation that supposedly was no longer a threat and relic of the Cold War era . Now , borderline Russophobia permeates the Democratic Party .\nAlso , before we draw conclusions regarding Russia , Putin , and the interference campaign , it was only the Director of National Intelligence , the FBI , the CIA , and the NSA who said they had high confidence that Putin ordered this interference campaign .
