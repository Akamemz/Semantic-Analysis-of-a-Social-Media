    "content": "As part of his new effort to focus on school safety in response to the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School , President Trump has returned to an old punching bag : his predecessor . Trump 's school safety commission will investigate an Obama policy originally meant to help minority students avoid disciplinary discrimination . The policy , despite its success in some areas , has come under fire in conservative circles because of a perception that it lets dangerous individuals avoid punishment .\nTrump said the commission will look into a `` repeal of the Obama administration 's 'Rethink School Discipline ' policies , '' The New York Times reported . \u2588\u2588\u2588 has reached out to the White House for comment .\nThe `` Rethink School Discipline '' guidelines originally came in the form of a letter jointly filed by the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education . It relies on research from those departments that points to systematic discrimination that minority students suffer in terms of school discipline , and it suggests ways for school to be more careful in handing out punishment .\nSen. Marco Rubio pointed to the Obama policy as a reason why the alleged Parkland shooter might have slipped through the disciplinary cracks . However , critics said Rubio 's argument was a weak one , given that the shooter is white and was disciplined to the full extent of the school 's capability when he was expelled .\nAccording to a December 2016 White House report , the Rethink School Discipline policies aim to `` support all students and promote a welcome and safe climate in schools '' by guiding schools to limit the number of suspensions that they handed out . The research presented there had found that minority and disabled students were given out-of-school suspensions at a much higher rate than their peers , so the policy laid out numerous ways that schools could work with other stakeholders to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all students .\nWhen schools bought into the policies , they saw some growth and change in their school atmospheres . However , fixing a problem with so many layers inevitably takes time and hard work , so the policies did n't solve everything immediately \u2014 especially because , as The American Prospect reports , many of the schools with the most disciplinary problems also have issues with funding . Connecting this effort with the similarly necessary effort to stop school shootings , however , has critics saying that the administration is conflating two entirely separate issues .\nOne point that critics have brought up is that school shooters , unlike the minority students at the receiving end of discriminatory disciplinary practices , are usually white . Many of the mass school shootings that most deeply shook the nation \u2014 Columbine , Sandy Hook , Parkland \u2014 had nothing to do with students who would have been affected by this policy , and instead were carried out by white men . As Catherine Lhamon , the Education Department assistant secretary for civil rights in the Obama administration , told USA Today , solving the problem of discrimination in schools `` is completely divorced and should be completely divorced from how to address external shooters . ''\nThe New York Times reports , however , that the Trump administration has targeted this set of policies because of a belief that they allow potential shooters to essentially slip through the cracks . This is part of the administration 's set of guidelines meant to improve school safety , which gun control advocates had hoped would include pledges that the president had mentioned in the past , like a higher minimum age for buying rifles . Instead , the guidelines largely toed the NRA 's desired line and focused on `` hardening '' schools rather than toughening gun control . The suggestion that this Obama-era policy could be repealed is a perfect example of that spirit .",
