    "content": "Dr. Anthony Fauci was careful not to directly rebuke President Donald Trump during Tuesday \u2019 s Senate hearing on the coronavirus pandemic . Even so , the totality of his testimony undermined talking points Trump has used to downplay the pandemic while pushing for the premature opening of businesses and schools .\nFauci \u2014 who as director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is the government \u2019 s top infectious disease expert \u2014 made clear that he thinks states should pump the brakes on reopening until the number of new cases per day starts going down . And with one notable exception , senators \u2014 even the Republican ones \u2014 seemed appreciative of his input .\nThe tone for the hearing was set immediately , when Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-TN ) \u2014 chair of the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 kicked things off by talking about people going \u201c back to school and back to work , \u201d even though he \u2019 s currently self-quarantining in Tennessee after one of his staffers tested positive for Covid-19 . Fauci didn \u2019 t waste any time pouring cold water on a question Alexander asked about the possibility of universities reopening in the fall .\n\u201c The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate the re-entry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far , \u201d he said .\nMinutes later , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) used his questioning time to guide Fauci through the demolition of two of Trump \u2019 s favorite talking points .\nTrump , for instance , has repeatedly insisted that the coronavirus \u201c is going to disappear , \u201d including as recently as last week . But in response to a question from Sanders , Fauci made clear that is not going to happen .\n\u201c When you talk about \u2018 will this virus just disappear \u2019 \u2014 and I \u2019 ve said publicly many times , that is just not gon na happen because it \u2019 s such a highly transmissible virus , \u201d he said . \u201c And even if we get better control over several months , it is likely that there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will eventually get back to us . \u201d\nFauci with a subtle rebuke of Trump : `` When you talk about 'will this virus just disappear ' -- and I 've said publicly many times , that is just not gon na happen because it 's such a highly transmissible virus .

Mitt Romney ( R-UT ) asked Fauci if Obama did anything that \u201c made the likelihood of creating a vaccine less likely. \u201d Fauci quickly dismissed the question \u2014 and , by implication , Trump \u2019 s talking point .\nROMNEY : The president said the other day that Obama is responsible for our lack of a vaccine .
