A federal court in California ordered the Trump administration to release all documents relating to its decision to terminate the program . The government counters that it need not publicize its sensitive internal deliberations .\nThe order appears to be the product of a compromise , as the justices split five to four along ideological lines on Dec. 8 over the same issue . This time , however , it appears all the justices agreed that the California court \u2019 s order was \u201c overly broad , \u201d and that the breadth of the order warrants a slight rapping on the knuckles .\n\u201c The government makes serious arguments that at least portions of the district court \u2019 s order are overly broad , \u201d the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling reads .

That the Court reviewed this matter at all suggests that at least some of the justices believe lower courts have treated the administration with imprudence or intemperance , warranting a reprimand .\nThe Court has elsewhere flashed impatience with the lower court hearing challenges to the travel ban . In early December the justices issued a pair of rulings allowing the president \u2019 s latest travel sanctions to take full effect , overturning two lower courts that initially barred their enforcement .\nThe rulings , which drew dissents from Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor , are terse and straightforward , suggesting the Court sees little ambiguity in the cases and believes the Trump administration will ultimately prevail .
