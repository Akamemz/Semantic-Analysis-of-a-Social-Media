    "content": "DALLAS \u2014 Former president George W. Bush , who has written a book he calls `` a love letter '' to his father ( that would be former president George H.W . Bush ) , also has a message in mind for brother Jeb .\n`` I think he 'd be a superb president and I think he 'd be a very good candidate and I think he could heal wounds , '' Bush told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview Friday about 41 : A Portrait of My Father , being published Tuesday by Crown Publishers . `` Dad very much wants him to run , '' though he acknowledges , `` Mother , of course , has had a different point of view . ''\nThe 294-page book , which offers an affectionate and anecdotal account of the elder Bush 's rise in politics and tenure as the nation 's 41st president , underscores the historic status the Bush dynasty already has achieved . John Adams and John Quincy Adams , from the republic 's early days , are the only other father-and-son to have both won the White House .\nA successful bid by former Florida governor Jeb Bush , who says he 's now weighing whether to seek the presidency himself in 2016 , would break ground .\nSpeaking of unprecedented : That also might set up a family rematch from 1992 , when then-Arkansas Gov . Bill Clinton ousted George H.W . Bush from the White House . This time , spouse Hillary Rodham Clinton is the favorite for the Democratic nomination , and son Jeb Bush instantly would become one of the most serious contenders for the Republican one .\nIn the book , Bush describes the deep sadness his father felt after losing his campaign for a second term in 1992 \u2014 followed , unexpectedly , by a friendship that developed between him and Clinton , whose father had been killed in a car accident before he was born .\n`` Many who watched the relationship would say that in some ways Dad 's like a father figure to him , '' Bush says , calling the bond between the two formal rivals `` very poignant . '' Says Bush : `` I think Bill found in George Bush a person that he could trust and an older person with whom he could relax and have confidence in . ''\nEven so , he says the Bush clan would feel no need to pull their punches against Hillary Clinton in a campaign .\n`` I 'd be all out '' in campaigning for Jeb , Bush vows . `` If he wants me to , I 'd be helping him as best I can . And I think Bill Clinton would be all in , obviously , for his bride . ''\nHe says some of the so-called Bush fatigue and the pitched debate over the wisdom of the Iraq War , factors that might have dogged a campaign by Jeb Bush in 2008 and 2012 , have eased . `` Time fades a lot of memory , and the emotions get wrung out of the system , '' he says . `` The new president comes and there 's a lot of focus on him . It 's kind of like Dad , you know . With time , people are taking a second look at him , a different appreciation of his contributions and how he conducted his life . ''\nIndeed , a Gallup Poll in June found the elder Bush lagging only Clinton in favorable ratings among living former and current presidents , at 64 % and 63 % . The younger Bush ranked next , at 53 % , ahead of Jimmy Carter ( 52 % ) and Barack Obama ( 47 % ) .\nGeorge W. Bush got the idea of writing 41 when he learned that John Quincy Adams , to the dismay of historians , had never written a book about his father .\n`` He did start to write such a book about his father and his relationship with his father , but he could not complete it , '' says Fred Kaplan , a professor emeritus at the City University of New York and author of John Quincy Adams : American Visionary , published by HarperCollins in May . `` He had a deep , deep devotion to his father 's memory , and especially to the great accomplishments of his father . ''\nJohn Quincy Adams also felt his father was n't getting the credit he deserved , Kaplan says .\nAll that sounds familiar to Bush , whose admiration for his father is open and emotional . He argues his father 's contribution to the country , including his role in the peaceful end of the Cold War , has n't yet been fully acknowledged .\nOne reason might be the elder Bush 's decision not to write a traditional presidential memoir when he left office in 1993 . He did co-author a book on global challenges in 1999 with his former national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , titled A World Transformed , and a compilation of his letters was published last year .\nBush speculates that his father did n't write a more personal memoir because of his reluctance to do anything that might sound like what his mother decried as braggadocio and because he did n't want to re-live the painful days of the 1992 election , when many voters saw him as insensitive or unaware of their economic anxieties .\n`` I 'm confident that he will get credit as time goes on , '' Bush says . `` I just want to be the first one out of the barn . I think people will look back and say what a good man George Bush was . ''\nWhat many do n't realize , he says , is what a risk taker his father has been throughout his life . A child of privilege , he enlisted in the Navy at age 18 to fight in World War II , then turned down invitations from Wall Street when he finally graduated from Yale . Instead , he and wife Barbara moved , young George in tow , to pursue business opportunities in the wilds of west Texas .\nHe took an unlikely path to the White House , his son notes , holding a succession of four jobs that no other president has held , before or since : national party chairman , United Nations ambassador , top diplomat to China , CIA director .\nThrough it all , the elder Bush demonstrated an impulse to reach out to former enemies in a way that seems particularly remarkable at a time of today 's poisonous partisanship . Years after the Reagan-Bush ticket won re-election in 1984 , Bush and his vanquished vice-presidential rival , then-New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro , became friends . `` I hope it 's OK if I say I love you , '' he told her in an e-mail shortly before she died in 2011 .\nIn 2000 , after the torturous presidential campaign had been settled in his son 's favor by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision , Bush made a conciliatory phone call to the defeated Al Gore , the book reports . `` I 've lost a few times myself , '' he told him , `` and I know how you feel . ''\nIndeed , Bush as president decided to attend the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito , even though his forces had shot him down over the Pacific in World War II . He became friends with Clinton after losing the White House to him . Just about the only person he seems not to have forgiven is Ross Perot , blamed by both father and son for siphoning off enough votes as a third-party candidate in 1992 to have cost the elder Bush a second term .\nSince Tuesday 's midterms , the younger Bush has felt empathy of his own for his successor in the White House .\nPresident Obama watched his fellow Democrats lose control of the Senate , giving opposition Republicans unified control of Congress for the final two years of his tenure . That 's precisely what happened to Bush in 2006 , the sixth-year midterm of his presidency , when his fellow Republicans lost the Senate and opposition Democrats won control of Congress . Indeed , the same thing happened to Ronald Reagan in 1986 , his sixth-year midterm .\n`` There 's a reality about every two-term presidency : Toward its end , Americans grow weary of the president , '' Bush writes in the book , adding in parentheses , `` ( Tell me about it ! ) ''\n`` I remember the 2006 campaign well and people were used to the president ; they were n't excited about the agenda so much ; they were beginning to think about who 's going to be on our TV screens next , '' he recalls in the interview . ( The Iraq War also had become deeply unpopular . ) `` It does n't matter who the person is . There 's a certain : 'Surely , we can do better . ' ''\nSince leaving the Oval Office , Bush generally has refused to critique Obama as president . In the book , Bush writes only that he was `` disappointed '' when Obama decided not to retain CIA Director Michael Hayden in the job when he took over . He also expresses regret that `` subsequent developments and decisions '' after he left office contributed to the rise of the terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , imperiling Iraq 's struggling democracy .\n`` For the sake of our security and the Iraqi people , I hope we will do what it takes to succeed , '' he writes . In the interview , though , he declines to discuss precisely what that might entail . `` I 'm not going to second-guess our president , '' he says .\nThat was a policy the elder Bush seems to have followed during his son 's presidency , even during deliberations over Iraq . Some analysts contrasted the elder Bush 's caution during the first Gulf War , when Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait , with the younger Bush 's decision to launch a U.S.-led invasion to depose Saddam Hussein . He cited the threat from weapons of mass destruction that in the end were n't found , and the U.S. involvement in Iraq continues even now . Obama announced Friday he was doubling the small U.S. deployment there , sending 1,500 more U.S. troops to help deal with the Islamic State threat .\nOn this and other issues , Bush says he had learned lessons from watching his father . But he rarely asked him for his views , and the elder Bush offered him no policy advice but unconditional love .\nThat said , Bush does offer some advice to Obama or any two-term president on how to handle the final two years of a tumultuous tenure , when your approval rating is falling and the political landscape is a less friendly place .\n`` You 've got to pick and choose your issues that are important to you and work as best as you can with the Congress , '' he says . `` In other words , people have got to know you 're going to make a good-faith effort , but on certain cases stand firm . ''\nHe cautions that unexpected developments could change things in an instant \u2014 as the financial meltdown in 2008 dominated his final months in office . `` You never know what 's going to affect the last two years of President Obama 's presidency , '' he says .\nBush also advises Obama to be ready for a tough transition when he leaves the White House .\n`` I 'm confident all presidents go through a let-down period ; it 's impossible not to , '' Bush says . He wrote a memoir titled Decision Points , established a presidential library and foundation on the campus of Southern Methodist University , and unexpectedly took up painting . `` My advice is to find interests , things that will keep you occupied and interested , and do it . ''\nAt 68 , Bush 's physical resemblance to his father has only gotten more striking over time . He poses in the courtyard of The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in front of bronze statues of the two of them , standing side by side . `` I used to say I had my daddy 's eyes and my mother 's mouth , which is really true , '' he says , a reference to his tendency to wisecrack .\nOn Tuesday at The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station , on the campus of Texas A & M , he formally will present his father with a copy of the book .
