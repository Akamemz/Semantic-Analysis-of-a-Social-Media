For anyone still doubting, you need look no further than the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s just-released estimates for the next decade. The verdict: Federal outlays spiked with the recession, remained high and will rise from there \u2013 even with their recent hike, revenues simply cannot keep pace.\n\nLike a connect-the-dot picture, CBO\u2019s \u201cThe Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2013 to 2023\u201d lays out the salient points of Washington\u2019s fiscal dilemma. The image is not pretty.\n\nWhat passes for good news comes this year. The federal deficit is projected to fall below $1 trillion for the first time in five years. It is expected to remain a staggering $845 billion \u2013 roughly $400 billion more than the amount for which the Bush administration was assailed in 2008.\n\nThen the bad news really begins: \u201cDeficits are projected to increase later in the coming decade, however, because of the pressures of an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt.\u201d\n\nThe key point from that fearsome foursome is that all of these are due to growing spending.\n\nYet could not falling revenues, as occurred during the recession and subsequent \u201cslow recovery seen since the recession ended in mid-2009\u201d still be a culprit?\n\nAccording to CBO estimates, the New Year\u2019s tax hike has addressed that issue \u2013 but good. \u201cFederal revenues will increase by roughly 25 percent between 2013 and 2015\u2026[and] revenues are projected to grow from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2015 \u2013 compared with an average of 17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s fiscal problem is that spending will also be above its past levels \u2013 only more so. \u201cAlthough outlays are projected to decline from 22.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 21.5 percent of GDP by 2017, they will still exceed their 4-year average of 21 percent.\u201d They also resume growing \u2013 reaching 22.9 percent of GDP by decade\u2019s end \u2013 while revenues on the other hand stay at their current GDP ratio.\n\nTo underscore that spending, not falling revenues, is driving the deficit: \u201cUnder CBO\u2019s baseline projections, most of the decline in the deficit in the next two years is the result of a projected significant rise in revenues, which are estimated to increase by 25 percent between 2013 and 2015.\u201d\n\nOK, that\u2019s \u201cthen,\u201d but isn\u2019t the present deficit the fault of revenues?
