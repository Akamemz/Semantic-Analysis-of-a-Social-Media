    "content": "The last days of Washington , D.C. : America can no longer mask its steep decline No matter how relentlessly we couch our military defeats , all empirical evidence point to a single conclusion\nThe dishonesty of words illustrates the dishonesty of America \u2019 s wars .\nSince 9/11 , can there be any doubt that the public has become numb to the euphemisms that regularly accompany U.S. troops , drones , and CIA operatives into Washington \u2019 s imperial conflicts across the Greater Middle East and Africa ? Such euphemisms are meant to take the sting out of America \u2019 s wars back home . Many of these words and phrases are already so well known and well worn that no one thinks twice about them anymore .\nHere are just a few : collateral damage for killed and wounded civilians ( a term used regularly since the First Gulf War of 1990-1991 ) . Enhanced interrogation techniques for torture , a term adopted with vigor by George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and the rest of their administration ( \u201c techniques \u201d that were actually demonstrated in the White House ) . Extraordinary rendition for CIA kidnappings of terror suspects off global streets or from remote badlands , often followed by the employment of enhanced interrogation techniques at U.S. black sites or other foreign hellholes . Detainees for prisoners and detention camp for prison ( or , in some cases , more honestly , concentration camp ) , used to describe Guant\u00e1namo ( Gitmo ) , among other places established offshore of American justice . Targeted killings for presidentially ordered drone assassinations . Boots on the ground for yet another deployment of \u201c our \u201d troops ( and not just their boots ) in harm \u2019 s way . Even the Bush administration \u2019 s Global War on Terror , its label for an attempt to transform the Greater Middle East into a Pax Americana , would be redubbed in the Obama years overseas contingency operations ( before any attempt at labeling was dropped for a no-name war pursued across major swathes of the planet ) .\nAs euphemisms were deployed to cloak that war \u2019 s bitter and brutal realities , over-the-top honorifics were assigned to America \u2019 s embattled role in the world . Exceptional , indispensable , and greatest have been the three words most commonly used by presidents , politicians , and the gung ho to describe this country . Once upon a time , if Americans thought this way , they felt no need to have their presidents and presidential candidates actually say so -- such was the confidence of the golden age of American power . So consider the constant redeployment of these terms a small measure of America \u2019 s growing defensiveness about itself , its sense of doubt and decline rather than strength and confidence .\nTo what end this concerted assault on the words we use ? In George Orwell \u2019 s classic 1946 essay \u201c Politics and the English Language , \u201d he noted that his era \u2019 s equivalents for \u201c collateral damage \u201d were \u201c needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. \u201d Obviously , not much has changed in the intervening seven decades . And this is , as Orwell intuited , a dangerous way to go . Cloaking violent , even murderous actions in anodyne language might help a few doubting functionaries sleep easier at night , but it should make the rest of us profoundly uneasy .\nThe more American leaders and officials -- and the media that quotes them endlessly -- employ such euphemisms to cloak harsh realities , the more they ensure that such harshness will endure ; indeed , that it is likely to grow harsher and more pernicious as we continue to settle into a world of euphemistic thinking .\nIn the future , some linguist or lexicographer will doubtless compile a dictionary of perpetual war and perhaps ( since they may be linked ) imperial decline , focusing on the grim processes and versions of failure language can cloak . It would undoubtedly explore how certain words and rhetorical devices were used in twenty-first-century America to obscure the heavy burdens that war placed on the country , even as they facilitated its continuingfailed conflicts . It would obviously include classic examples like surge , used in both Iraq and Afghanistan to obscure the way our government rushed extra troops into a battle zone in a moment of failure only ensuring the extension of that failure , and the now-classic phrase shock and awe that obscured the reality of a massive air strike on Baghdad that resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians ( \u201c collateral damage \u201d ) , but not the \u201c decapitation \u201d of a hated regime .\nDon \u2019 t think , however , that the language of twenty-first-century American war was only meant to lull the public . Less familiar words and terms continue to be used within the military not to clarify tasks at hand but to obscure certain obvious realities even from those sanctioned to deal with them . Takeasymmetrical warfare , the gray zone , and VUCA . Unless you spend time in Department of Defense and military circles , you probably haven \u2019 t heard of these .\nAsymmetrical warfare suggests that the enemy fights unfairly and in a thoroughly cowardly fashion , regularly lurking behind and mixing with civilians ( \u201c hostages \u201d ) , because that enemy doesn \u2019 t have the moxie to don uniforms and stand toe-to-toe in a \u201c kinetic \u201d smack-down with U.S. troops . As a result , of course , the U.S. must be prepared for underhanded tactics and devious weaponry , including ambushes and IEDs ( improvised explosive devices , or roadside bombs ) , as well as a range of other \u201c unconventional \u201d tactics now all too familiar in a world plagued by violent attacks against \u201c soft \u201d targets ( aka civilians ) . It must also be prepared to engage an enemy mixed in with a civilian population and so brace itself for the inevitable collateral damage that is now so much the essence of American war .\nThat groups like the Islamic State ( ISIS ) would choose to fight \u201c asymmetrically \u201d should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who \u2019 s ever been confronted by a much bigger and better armed kid in a schoolyard . Misdirection , a sucker punch , a slingshot , even running away to fight another day are \u201c asymmetrical \u201d approaches that are sensible indeed for any outgunned and overmatched opponent . The term is a truism , nothing more , when it comes to the realities of our world . It is , however , a useful way of framing matters for those in the Pentagon and the military who don \u2019 t want to think seriously about the grim course of action , focused significantly on civilian populations , they are pursuing , which often instills anger and the urge for revenge in such populations and so , in the end , runs at cross purposes to stated U.S. aims .\nThe \u201c gray zone \u201d is a fuzzy term used in military circles to describe the perplexing nature of lower-level conflicts , often involving non-state actors , that don \u2019 t qualify as full-fledged wars . These are often fought using non-traditional weapons and tactics ranging from cyber attacks to the propagandizing of potential terror recruits via social media . This \u201c zone \u201d is unnerving to Pentagon types in part because the vast majority of the Pentagon \u2019 s funding goes to conventional weaponry that \u2019 s as subtle as a sledgehammer : big-ticket items like aircraft carriers , nuclear submarines , main battle tanks , strategic bombers , and wildly expensive multi-role aircraft such as the F-35 ( now estimated to cost roughly $ 1.4 trillion through its lifecycle ) . Much of this weaponry is \u201c too big to fail \u201d in the funding wars in Washington , but regularly fails in the field precisely because it \u2019 s too big to be used effectively against the latest crop of evasive enemies . Hence , that irresolvable gray zone which plagues America \u2019 s defense planners and operatives .\nThe question the gray zone both raises and obscures is : Why has the U.S. done so poorly when , by its own definition , it remains the biggest , baddest superpower around , the one that outspends its non-state enemies by a factor so large it can \u2019 t even be calculated ? Keep in mind , for instance , that the 9/11 attacks on American soil were estimated to have cost Osama bin Laden at most a half-million dollars . Multiply that by 400 and you can buy one \u201c made in America \u201d F-35 jet fighter .\nIf the gray zone offers little help clarifying America \u2019 s military dilemmas , what about VUCA ? It \u2019 s an acronym for volatile , uncertain , complex , and ambiguous , which is meant to describe our post-9/11 world . Of course , there \u2019 s nothing like an acronym to take the sting out of any world . But as an historian who has read a lot of history books , let me confess that , to the best of my knowledge , the world has always been , is now , and will always be VUCA .\nFor any future historian of the Pentagon \u2019 s language , let me sum things up this way : instead of honest talk about war in all its ugliness and uncertainty , military professionals of our era have tended to substitute buzz words , catchphrases , and acronyms . It \u2019 s a way of muddying the water . It allows the world of war to tumble on without serious challenge , which is why it \u2019 s been so useful in these years to speak of , say , COIN ( Counterinsurgency ) or 4GW ( Fourth-Generation Warfare ) .\nMuch like its most recent enthusiast , General David Petraeus , COIN has once again lost favor in the military , but Fourth-Generation Warfare is still riding high and sounds so refreshingly forward-looking , not like the stale Vietnam-era wine in a post-9/11 bottle that it is . In reality , it \u2019 s another iteration of insurgency and COIN mixed and matched with Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong \u2019 s people 's war . To prevail in places like Afghanistan , so 4GW thinkers suggest , one needs to win hearts and minds -- yes , that classic phrase of defeat in Vietnam -- while securing and protecting ( a definite COINage ) the people against insurgents and terrorists . In other words , we \u2019 re talking about an acronym that immediately begins to congeal if you use older words to describe it like \u201c pacification \u201d and \u201c nation-building. \u201d The latest 4GW jargon may not help win wars , but it does sometimes win healthy research grants from the government .\nThe fact is that trendy acronyms and snappy buzz words have a way of limiting genuine thinking on war . If America is to win ( or , far better , avoid ) future wars , its war professionals need to look more honestly at that phenomenon in all of its dimensions . So , too , do the American people , for it \u2019 s in their name that such wars are allegedly waged .\nThese days , Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter often resorts to cancer imagery when describing the Islamic state . `` Parent tumor '' is an image he especially favors -- that is , terrorism as a cancer that America \u2019 s militarized surgeons need to attack and destroy before it metastasizes and has \u201c children. \u201d ( Think of the ISIS franchises in Libya , where the organization has recently doubled in size , Afghanistan , and Yemen . ) Hence the proliferation of \u201c surgical strikes \u201d by drones and similarly \u201c surgical \u201d Special Ops raids , both of which you could think of as America \u2019 s equivalent of white blood cells in its war on the cancer of terrorism .\nBut is terrorism really a civilizational cancer that can be \u201c cured \u201d via the most aggressive \u201c kinetic \u201d treatments ? Can the U.S. render the world cancer-free ? For that \u2019 s what Carter \u2019 s language implies . And how does one measure \u201c progress \u201d in a \u201c war \u201d on the cancer of ISIS ? Indeed , from an outsider \u2019 s perspective , the proliferation of U.S. military bases around the world ( there are now roughly 800 ) , as well as of drone strikes , Special Ops raids , and massive weapons exports might have a cancerous look to them . In other words , what constitutes a \u201c cancer \u201d depends on one \u2019 s perspective -- and perhaps one \u2019 s definition of world \u201c health , \u201d too .\nThe very notion of progress in America \u2019 s recent wars is one that a colleague , Michael Murry , recently critiqued . A U.S. Navy Vietnam War Veteran , he wrote me that , for his favorite military euphemism , \u201c I have to go with \u2018 progress \u2019 as incessantly chanted by the American military brass in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2026\n\u201c We go on hearing about 14 years of \u2018 progress \u2019 which , to hear our generals tell it , would vanish in an instant should the United States withdraw its forces and let the locals and their neighbors sort things out . Since when do \u2018 fragile gains \u2019 equate to \u2018 progress \u2019 ? Who in their right mind would invest rivers of blood and trillions of dollars in \u2018 fragility \u2019 ? Now that I think of it , we also have the euphemistic expression of \u2018 drawdown \u2019 substituting for \u2018 withdrawal \u2019 which in turn substitutes for \u2018 retreat. \u2019 The U.S. military and the civilian government it has browbeaten into hapless acquiescence simply can not face the truth of their monumental failures and so must continually bastardize our language in a losing -- almost comical -- attempt to stay one linguistic step ahead of the truth . \u201d\nProgress , as Murry notes , basically means nothing when such \u201c gains , \u201d in the words of David Petraeus during the surge months in Iraq in 2007 , are both \u201c fragile \u201d and \u201c reversible. \u201d Indeed , Petraeus repeated the same two words in 2011 to describe similar U.S. \u201c progress \u201d in Afghanistan , and today it couldn \u2019 t be clearer just how much \u201c progress \u201d was truly made there . Isn \u2019 t it time for government officials to stop banging the drums of war talk in favor of \u201c progress \u201d when none exists ?\nThink , for instance , of the American-trained ( and now re-trained ) Iraqi security forces . Each year U.S. officials swear that the Iraqi military is getting ever closer to combat readiness , but much like one of Zeno \u2019 s paradoxes , the half-steps that military takes under American tutelage never seem to get it into fighting shape . Progress , eternally touted , seems always to lead to regress , eternally explained away , as that army regularly underperforms or its units simply collapse , often abandoning their American-supplied weaponry to the enemy . Here we are , 12 years after the U.S. began training the Iraqi military and once again it seems to be cratering , this time while supposedly on the road to retaking Iraq \u2019 s second largest city , Mosul , from its Islamic State occupiers . Progress , anyone ?\nIn short , the dishonesty of the words the U.S. military regularly wields illustrates the dishonesty of its never-ending wars . After so many years of failure and frustration , of wars that aren \u2019 t won and terrorist movements that only seem to spread as its leaders are knocked off , isn \u2019 t it past time for Americans to ditch phrases like \u201c collateral damage , \u201d \u201c enemy noncombatant , \u201d \u201c no-fly zone \u201d ( or even worse , \u201c safe zone \u201d ) , and \u201c surgical strike \u201d and adopt a language , however grim , that accurately describes the military realities of this era ?\nWords matter , especially words about war . So as a change of pace , instead of the usual bloodless euphemisms and vapid acronyms , perhaps the U.S. government could tell the shocking and awful truth to the American people in plain language about the realities and dangers of never-ending war .",

After so many years of failure and frustration, of wars that aren\u2019t won and terrorist movements that only seem to spread as its leaders are knocked off, isn\u2019t it past time for Americans to ditch phrases like \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d \u201cenemy noncombatant,\u201d \u201cno-fly zone\u201d (or even worse, \u201csafe zone\u201d), and \u201csurgical strike\u201d and adopt a language, however grim, that accurately describes the military realities of this era?\n\nWords matter, especially words about war. So as a change of pace, instead of the usual bloodless euphemisms and vapid acronyms, perhaps the U.S. government could tell the shocking and awful truth to the American people in plain language about the realities and dangers of never-ending war.",
