    "content": "One of the reasons that Mary Katharine Ham and I wrote End of Discussion in 2015 was our rising concern that Americans -- younger ones in particular -- are gradually adopting an increasingly hostile posture toward free speech and the open debate . One of the Left 's most cynical ploys in stifling political discussions is to brand ideas they oppose as hateful and offensive , and therefore morally unworthy of further consideration . They seek to `` win '' debates , we wrote , by short-circuiting the process and preventing those debates from happening in the first place . Ours is largely a cultural critique , leaving detailed constitutional analyses and journalistic exposes of bureaucratic abuses to others . But citizens ' views of what the constitution does , or should , protect can be heavily influenced by cultural pressures , which is why some key bits of this survey of American high school students conducted by the Knight Foundation are rather alarming :\nYikes . Some of these results are open to interpretation because the question does n't really drill down too far . If kids think that `` bullying '' is synonymous with `` specific threats of physical violence , '' they 'd be right that free speech protections would n't apply . But if they think that `` you 're fugly '' taunts or `` gay people are degenerate sinners '' assertions rise to the level of speech that can be banned or criminalized , we 're in more serious trouble . One of the positive data points in this poll is that 91 percent majority atop the bar graph . Allahpundit notes that the percentage of students who believe that unpopular speech is a protected right ( to reiterate , so much of this comes back to the degree of under-explored overlap between `` unpopular '' and `` offensive '' or `` bullying '' ) has risen by eight points since this survey 's 2004 installment . That 's real , heartening progress , as is the slow but steady incline in the blue line on this chart :\nStudents are less disposed than ever to believe that the First Amendment 's safeguards of fundamental rights are too excessive . That 's reassuring , but only to a point . AP mines another nugget from the results : `` Worse yet , when the Knight Foundation asked students whether free speech is more important than protecting someone from being offended , just 64 percent said yes \u2014 a majority , sure , but not even a two-thirds majority . '' That top line result is dragged down by smaller majorities of high schoolers of color ( Asians , Hispanics and especially blacks ) who believe that the value of upholding free speech trumps the value of insulating somebody from taking offense . One of the more insidious tactics of the anti-discussion mob has been to conflate offensive speech with physical violence , rooted in a capacious definition of what constitutes `` safety . '' To the extent that this trick successfully and lastingly manipulates younger generations may determine whether free speech and expression remains a core American value . Remember , it 's unpopular/offensive/bullying speech that tests the principle . It 's relatively easy to protect anodyne , civilly-expressed speech ; it 's the nasty stuff that is much harder , and therefore especially vital , to shield from the bipartisan authoritarian impulse to ban and silence . All said , findings of this survey are enough of a mixed bag as to nurture some cautious optimism and stave off outright despair , but there are some red flags flying , too .
