    "content": "Hillary Clinton has never felt comfortable with the traveling political press .\nAs first lady , she would sometimes arrange travel for herself and daughter Chelsea separate from her husband , partly to avoid the protective pool of reporters assigned to the president . In 2008 , she \u201c fought tooth and nail , \u201d former aides said , to avoid sharing the plane with her press corps and relented only when her campaign was running out of money and had to either bring the reporters on board or downgrade to commercial .\nAnd in 2016 , with plenty of cash and a winning position in the race , Clinton has managed to keep the press at arm \u2019 s length \u2014 preserving her private plane as a refuge where the only people around are her trusted campaign aides .\nThat changes on Labor Day , when the reporters and their press-leery candidate will for the first time board a \u201c Stronger Together \u201d -wrapped 737 and fly from New York to Ohio to Iowa , and remain flying companions for the final stretch of the campaign .\nHer team insists Clinton is on board with the setup , despite her distrust of the national media . `` She does understand that there is very good reason why it 's important for everyone to be together in the thick of a general election , \u201d said her traveling spokesman , Nick Merrill . \u201c We 're going to wrap the plane in blue and get on it together . There 's a desire to be efficient and be able to do things a little more impromptu . \u201d\nBut closer quarters are no guarantee of a new level of access . \u201c The times she 'll go back and schmooze will be few and far between , \u201d predicted one longtime Clinton ally . \u201c She 'll send other people back there , instead . \u201d\nIndeed , trailing Clinton since she became the Democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience .\nWhen she \u2019 s speaking at a fundraiser , reporters camped outside can sometimes hear a muffled voice but can rarely make out her actual words . When she \u2019 s greeting voters at a coffee shop or on a rope line after a rally , the former secretary of state often looks right through the reporters hovering around her , like they don \u2019 t exist . And when she does acknowledge their physical presence , she smiles through the questions barked at her and encourages reporters to sample a coffee , or a chocolate , instead .\nThere are full days when the rotating pool of traveling press does not even set eyes on Clinton . In one instance last month , Clinton slipped out to Martha \u2019 s Vineyard from New York , ditching the pool of reporters assigned to cover her altogether .\nCertainly , the past month has been somewhat out of the ordinary for the campaign \u2014 Clinton has been on a cash dash , spending the bulk of the end of summer at private , closed-press fundraisers rather than public events . ( Twice , she popped up to call in to cable television programs . ) But there has hardly been a halcyon period of accessibility since she launched her campaign 18 months ago .\nAs she enters the final stage of the race , sparking new hopes of accessibility onboard Hill Force One , here is a sampling from life on the road with Clinton , culled from the print pool reports for the past 20 days :\nDrowned Out By a Jet Engine , Aug. 31 : Clinton \u2019 s plane landed in Cincinnati , from East Hampton , New York , ahead of her speech to the American Legion .

While she raked in the cash , the pool didn \u2019 t have much to report on . \u201c Pool was unable to hear a word of HRC 's remarks at first cocktail party .
