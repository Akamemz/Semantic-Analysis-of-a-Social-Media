( July 12 ) AP\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans Thursday released a revised version of their plan to replace Obamacare \u2014 dumping some tax cuts for the wealthy , allowing for more insurance policies with limited coverage and increasing funding to fight the opioid addiction epidemic .\nBut it 's unclear whether the changes are enough to win over moderates concerned that the bill \u2019 s cuts to Medicaid and private insurance subsidies will leave millions without care , or whether conservatives are satisfied the bill would repeal enough of the Affordable Care Act 's taxes and regulations .\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , had to scrap a planned Senate vote at the end of June because he could not round up the 50 Republican votes he needs to advance the legislation . Thursday he said the Senate will vote on the bill next week , even though there are still wavering Republican senators who have not committed to vote for it .\nHere \u2019 s a look at what is in the revised bill , and how it could affect you .\nThe revised version keeps the taxes imposed by the ACA on investment income , on high earners . And it no longer eliminates the ACA \u2019 s limit on how much of the executive \u2019 s pay an insurance company can write off as a corporate tax deduction . The bill would still repeal other ACA taxes , including those on tanning beds , sectors of the health care industry and on high-cost employer-provided insurance plans .\nWould you still receive a subsidy to reduce the cost of premiums ?\nYou could still lose all or some of your subsidy , which is now available to people earning up to $ 84,650 for a family of three . That income limit would still be lowered slightly and would become less generous . But people who have tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts can use their HSA contributions to pay for premiums , instead of just for health services and products as they can now .\nThe bill would let anyone buy catastrophic plans , including those who qualify for subsidies . Those plans have low premiums , but high deductibles and limited benefits .\nWhat if you need a lot of health care services ?\nIf an insurer offers plans that meet the ACA \u2019 s requirements \u2014 including covering minimum benefits and not charging sicker people more \u2014 theinsurer could receive funding to help cover the cost of sick customers . But it \u2019 s unclear whether the funding would be enough to keep the plans affordable . Because insurers would also be able to sell plans that don \u2019 t meet the ACA \u2019 s requirements , that would segment the market into sick and healthy people . Insurance companies say that would destabilize the market and increase costs for people with pre-existing conditions .\nBut would insurers have to cover you if you have a pre-existing condition ?\nThe plans that don \u2019 t meet the ACA \u2019 s requirements would not have to accept sick people , according to Larry Levitt , senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation . And the bill would make it easier for states to waive requirements that insurance plans cover specific benefits , which could make it difficult for those with expensive health conditions to find affordable plans . Like the earlier version , the new bill would also still end the ACA 's requirement that insurers spend a specific amount of the premiums they collect on benefits , instead of on profits , administration and other expenses\nWould you still get help paying for deductibles and co-payments ?\nThe bill would still sunset in two years cost-sharing subsidies for low- and middle-income people who purchase insurance on an exchange . But it now includes an additional $ 70 billion \u2013 up from $ 112 billion \u2013 for states to reduce insurance costs in other ways . States would have to match the funds .\nThe bill would still eliminate the ACA 's requirement that insurers ca n't charge older customers more than three times what younger customers pay for the same coverage . Instead , those in their 60s could be charged five times as much , or more .\nWould young adults be able to stay on their parents \u2019 plan ?\nThe bill would not change the ACA \u2019 s rule that dependent children can stay on a parent 's plan until age 26 .\nIf you are among the more than 14 million Americans who gained eligibility through the ACA , you could still lose it . Enhanced federal funding for the low-income adults who became newly qualified would be phased out , ending after 2024 .\nFederal support for traditional Medicaid would also still be scaled back . States , which pay a portion of the cost of Medicaid , would have to find new funding or cut the program through restricting enrollment , curbing benefits , reducing payments to health care providers or finding efficiencies .\nThe revised bill does include changes to the way hospitals are paid by the federal government to help cover the bills of the uninsured , which are expected to increase . And if a state has a health emergency , the extra spending needed would not count toward the state \u2019 s new limit on federal Medicaid dollars .\nThe bill still effectively removes the ACA \u2019 s requirement that most people buy insurance by eliminating the tax penalties for failing to do so . But those who have a gap in their insurance coverage would have to wait six months before they can re-enroll .\nThe bill would still end the ACA \u2019 s penalties for larger employers who do n't offer insurance to workers . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said fewer employers will offer coverage if that change is made .\nWhat if you or a family member are struggling with addiction ?\nThe revised bill increases funding to states for addiction services , including $ 45 billion instead of the $ 2 billion in the initial version . That \u2019 s how much GOP Sens . Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia were seeking to help fight the opioid epidemic in their hard-hit states .
