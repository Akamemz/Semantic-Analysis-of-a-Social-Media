Marco Rubio says the mushrooming controversies surrounding the Obama administration reflect a `` culture of intimidation '' created by President Barack Obama.In an exclusive interview Thursday with \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV , the Florida Republican explained : `` You have a president and an administration and a political apparatus around him that has decided the way to win the political battles of the day is to destroy your political opponents , to basically impugn their motives , to talk bad about them , to convince people that they 're bad people , and that they 're doing things for bad reasons . `` That take-no-prisoners attitude , he said , `` permeates throughout their entire organization . `` On Thursday , the president said he had no warning about an inspector general 's report on the Internal Revenue Service 's selective scrutiny of small-government advocacy groups . The report details how IRS staffers targeted for scrutiny conservative groups that had applied for nonprofit status . News reports have detailed that liberal and progressive groups often got a pass.Obama stressed during a news conference that `` whether you 're a Democrat or a Republican , you should be outraged . `` But Rubio believes the IRS scandal is only the tip of the iceberg . He highlighted the recent revelation that a Romney donor became the subject of two IRS audits just weeks after the Obama campaign publicly attacked him . He added that there are `` everyday Americans who were simply exercising their constitutional rights to participate in the political process '' who were targeted for their views by a range of government departments.Rubio also cited a National Labor Relations Board decision against Boeing . `` That 's the culture of intimidation that permeates throughout this administration and that trickles down to these agencies . We have a long list of people that say the EPA is targeting them , the National Labor Relations Board is targeting them , the IRS we know is targeting them , the Labor Department is targeting them . `` When you have a White House that 's all about politics , all about demonizing your opponents , this is what you 're going to get from the people that work underneath you , '' he added.Rubio said the scandals have undermined people 's fundamental trust in government , a problem , he argued , which could stall progress on other big issues , such as proposals for immigration reform currently being debated in Congress . Rubio is part of the bipartisan `` Gang of Eight '' in the Senate pushing the immigration reform package.Rubio says his efforts are being undermined by the IRS debacle and other scandals surrounding the administration . `` In the last few days we 've seen not one but two Democrats in the Senate come forward who say they 're not voting for the [ immigration ] bill unless the border security measures are stronger , and so what that tells you is that people just do n't trust the federal government to secure the border . `` They want it ironclad , and of course , when you see stories about the IRS and the government subpoenaing the records of The Associated Press and things like that , it further undermines people 's trust in the government . `` Rubio , a proponent of establishing a path to citizenship for the nation 's 11 million undocumented workers , said that despite the disputed claims by the Heritage Foundation about the costs of immigration reform , the bill before the Senate will not cost the government anything . `` I can tell you that the bill that we have will actually not cost the government any money , but , in fact , help the economy grow and save us money . `` He said there are costs to keeping the current system in place , and that some of the costs identified by the Heritage study would exist with or without immigration reform . `` One of the costs , for example , that are built into the Heritage study is 4.5 million U.S. citizen children born to folks who are here illegally . They 're going to be here with or without immigration reform , '' Rubio said . `` They 're entitled to whatever a U.S. citizen is entitled to . `` `` On the other hand , we know that these folks , about 40 to 50 percent of the people illegally here , are not paying Social Security and Medicare taxes . If we pass immigration reform , they will be paying Social Security and Medicare taxes , but they wo n't be allowed to take anything out of the federal government . So there 's a cost right there . That runs in the hundreds of billions . ''",
