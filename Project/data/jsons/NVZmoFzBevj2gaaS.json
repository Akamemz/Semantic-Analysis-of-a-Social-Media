    "content": "The Trump administration Friday slapped sanctions on Russian senior officials , oligarchs and the companies they own , going after those closest to President Vladimir Putin to punish Moscow \u2019 s sinister activities around the world .\nIn a significant escalation of the sanctions , President Trump targeted oligarchs and companies in the energy sector that are the lifeblood of the Russian economy .\nHe also hit Mr. Putin \u2019 s son-in-law who became a major energy sector player after marrying into the Putin family .\nThe sanctions froze all assets for seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control , 17 senior Russian government officials , and a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary , a Russian bank .\nTreasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said they went after the oligarchs and government elites because they are the ones who profit from the Kremlin \u2019 s operations .\n\u201c The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe , including continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence in eastern Ukraine , supplying the Assad regime with material and weaponry as they bomb their own civilians , attempting to subvert Western democracies , and malicious cyber activities , \u201d he said . \u201c Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government \u2019 s destabilizing activities . \u201d\nThe sanctions are part of increasingly strong moves by the Trump administration . They follow previous sanctions on Russian officials and the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats last month over Moscow \u2019 s nerve-agent assassination attempt on a former Russian double agent in the U.K .\nThe U.S. now has hit 189 Russian individuals and entities with various sanctions .\nThe new sanctions brought a swift condemnation from senior Russian officials , who accused the Trump administration of lashing out to mask America \u2019 s own mounting problems .\n\u201c This is complete lawlessness , impotence and insanity that we \u2019 re seeing from the side of the Americans , \u201d said Gen. Vladimir Dzhabarov , deputy head of the International Affairs Committee of the upper house of the Russian parliament , according to a report in the Moscow Times . \u201c It \u2019 s all because [ U.S. ] projects on the international arena are failing , one after the other . \u201d\nIndustry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said of the Russian companies facing sanctions , \u201c We will support them even more . \u201d\nPresident Trump , dogged by special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s Russia collusion probe , also has struggled to shake the perception that he \u2019 s soft on Mr. Putin .\n\u201c Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have , \u201d Mr. Trump insisted Tuesday .\nThe administration would not say why Mr. Putin was not included on the sanctions list , but stressed that he would feel the impact .\n\u201c This will be noticed far and wide , \u201d said a senior administration official .\nThe Treasury has been preparing the sanctions for a long time , and they are directed at the \u201c full range of Russian activities , \u201d said another senior official .\nThe official said the moves are not a direct response to the assassination attempt in England , which triggered punitive action from governments around the world .\nSen.
