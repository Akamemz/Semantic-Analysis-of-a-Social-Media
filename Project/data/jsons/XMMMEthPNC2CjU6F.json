    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Mitch McConnell is the Senate majority leader -- and he 'd like to keep it that way .\nHeading into the final year of his first session leading the chamber -- which begins Monday when the Senate returns from its winter recess -- the Kentucky Republican is developing a carefully tailored legislative agenda . It is designed to support his top priority , which is not losing power to Democrats , who controlled the Senate for most of the past decade and who are committed to reclaiming it in the November elections .\nTo complicate his effort , the soft-spoken and methodical McConnell must accomplish this against the backdrop of a wildly unpredictable 2016 GOP presidential nominating campaign that has two anti-Washington agitators -- businessman Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- leading the pack . The controversial tone of their campaigns has mainstream Republicans deeply concerned about the impact on down-ticket candidates -- such as moderate GOP senators from purple states who must be re-elected if Republicans are to hold the Senate -- especially if Trump or Cruz win the Republican nomination .\nRepublicans currently have a narrow 54-46 advantage and must defend 24 seats this fall , seven in swing states that voted for President Barack Obama . Democrats need to protect just 10 seats , only one of which is considered competitive .\nA constant and challenging task in the months ahead for McConnell will be to protect incumbent senators like Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , Mark Kirk of Illinois , Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania , Rob Portman of Ohio , and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin from politically difficult votes on free trade , guns , abortion , and other sensitive social issues that could cause them trouble back home .\nMcConnell , who is firmly rooted in the establishment wing of the GOP , spent his first year running the chamber with a strategic eye toward the 2016 Senate elections . He believes he made an important down payment to voters by proving Republicans can govern more effectively and successfully than Democrats .\n`` By any objective standard , I think the Senate is clearly back to work , '' McConnell said at a year-end news conference .\nHe pushed through a number of major bills -- such as highway funding and education reform -- that were signed into law by Obama and he diligently prevented any real threat of government shutdowns or other dramatic `` fiscal cliffs '' that have shaken voters ' nerves in recent years .\n`` I wanted to end those sort of rattling experiences that the American people do n't like . It never produces a positive result anyway , '' McConnell said . `` I took those off the table the day after the election and we began to figure out how to get the Senate working again . ''\nMcConnell is tight-lipped about exactly which bills he will put on the floor and when ahead of the November election . Aides say many of those decisions need to be made after a joint House and Senate Republican retreat in Baltimore later this week . But he 's made clear that restoring a regular appropriations process -- where all 12 government spending bills will be debated and voted on separately -- is key .\nDemocrats fought that approach last year because Republicans were demanding higher spending for defense needs than domestic programs , a standoff that led to a breakthrough budget deal that set top-line government spending figures for 2016 and 2017 . Because of that , Democratic leaders believe McConnell 's ambition to take up all the spending bills may be doable .\n`` That seems to be pretty fertile ground for bipartisan compromise , '' said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-New York ) .\nIt may be ambitious to believe all these bills can actually pass the partisan Congress , especially with a legislative calendar truncated by the political conventions and other campaign activities . But if the parties could agree on some individual spending bills it would lower the risk of major government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins October 1 . That would be a relief to GOP leaders and a sign to voters they kept their word to avoid calamity .\nWhile there is a laundry list of other bills the Senate could take up this year -- including a massive international trade deal and sweeping criminal justice reform -- McConnell might be reluctant to negotiate anything major with a lame duck Democratic president and hold out to see if a Republican can win back the White House .\n`` I think no matter which party controls the White House , during a presidential year everything is overtaken by that election , '' said Brian Walsh , a former top official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee , which works to elect GOP Senate candidates . `` I think both parties are in a wait-and-see mode in terms of who is going to control the White House in the following year . I think it 's only prudent to hold off on big issues like this and see where things are in 12 months .
