I asked Johnson about his immigration policies from the perspective of a border state governor (:30), and pressed him on his previously-stated support for Obama's unilateral executive amnesty (6:45). Along the way, we also sparred over the term \"illegal immigrant,\" to which Johnson strenuously objected (4:20) as \"incendiary\" and offensive:\n\nJohnson laid out a pro-immigration platform, making the case that a robust legal immigration regime, featuring permissive work permit standards, is a boon to the US economy. And he again defended Obama's 'DAPA' executive order as \"appropriate,\" although he hedged on its constitutionality. In another segment of our chat, Johnson offered an \"elevator pitch\" to undecided right-leaning Americans, offered indictments against both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and explained his greatest government-constraining achievement over eight years as the Land of Enchantment's chief executive. Plus, why does he, a libertarian, keep saying that he agrees with Bernie Sanders, a socialist, '73 percent' of the time? And how might this assignment of agreement percentages apply to other major political figures on the scene today? Watch:\n\nJohnson described his ticket's outlook as \"fiscally conservative and socially inclusive,\" adding that unlike the two major party nominees, he and his running mate support free trade. He assailed Mrs. Clinton as an ethically compromised (\"pay for play\") and dishonest statist, and sharply criticized Trump's ideas on immigration and trade.
