The play has won 11 Tony Awards and a Pulitzer Prize for drama , and , according to Forbes , has generated over $ 1 billion in income from Broadway/London/United States tour ticket sales , publishing , cast recording and merchandising . A filmed version was released on the Disney+ streaming service on Friday .\nBut clearly it has landed in a different landscape from 2015 , when `` Hamilton '' premiered on Broadway . What Lauren Michele Jackson , writing in the New Yorker , calls the `` righteous , multicultural patriotism '' of the play seems now at odds with Black Lives Matter 's strident call for radical change to an America where the legacy of white supremacy lives on . In addition to demanding an end to anti-Black violence from police , many protesters have focused on removing or toppling various statues and monuments of Confederate leaders , as well as Andrew Jackson , Teddy Roosevelt , Christopher Columbus and even one of Abraham Lincoln , because of their symbolism .\nSome eyebrows were raised when `` Hamilton 's '' creator and lead actor , Lin-Manuel Miranda , and its producer , Jeffrey Seller , admitted in late May that they were guilty of the `` moral failure '' of not speaking up about the George Floyd protests . Last week , in a profile published in WSJ Magazine , Miranda 's father , Democratic political consultant Luis Miranda , spoke vaguely of having reached out to Black Lives Matter leaders `` to begin to have dialogue '' about how Hamilton and its `` family '' can work together with them .\nBut while there has been at least one report of the use of a `` Hamilton '' quote `` History is watching '' at a BLM protest , to reassess `` Hamilton '' now is to note a crucial incompatibility with our current moment : Its hero and its message are essentially ambivalent while today 's politics around America 's racial sins requires taking a strong stance . Indeed , `` Hamilton '' is a minefield of mixed messages : Is our takeaway about its main character that he is a revolutionary hero or flawed philanderer ? Is its strategy of non-traditional casting a triumph that allows people of color to `` rise up '' or are they undermined by the irony of how their embodiment as founding fathers ignores the fact that most of the characters they play were slave owners ?\n`` Hamilton '' was the perfect play for the Obama era because it fed into Democratic liberalism 's shift away from heroes like Thomas Jefferson -- who represented a figure of rugged pastoral individualism -- to Hamilton , the master banker/whiz kid financial planner . Miranda crafts `` Hamilton '' as an immigrant `` who gets the job done , '' an outsider . But Hamilton in reality faced none of the discrimination wielded against immigrants that he is drawn as a model for : for example , he had his elite education at Kings College in New York paid for by a trading company in his Caribbean island of St. Croix that had some dealings with the slave trade .\nThe ambivalence of Hamilton in the play is camouflaged by the love story at its center that seems also to be at the core of its appeal . First , his romance with Elizabeth Schuyler distracts our attention from the fact that the Schuylers were one of the largest and most notorious slave-owning families in New York state . The name is so scandalous that last month the mayor of Albany ordered the removal of a statue honoring Phillip Schuyler , Hamilton 's father-in-law .\nA similar bit of camouflage is carried out in the scene where Hamilton has an extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds .
