    "content": "Here 's How 2 Schools Have Made Free College Work \u2014 For Decades\nTwo colleges in Kentucky offer something that most university administrators can only dream of . Berea College and Alice Lloyd College charge students nothing for tuition .\nWhile each developed unique business models that do n't transfer easily to other schools , they do have some tips to help reduce the price of college tuition . More precisely \u2014 two tips and one caution .\nLocated in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains in central Kentucky , Berea College was founded by an abolitionist in 1855 . It was the first interracial and coeducational college in the South .\nWhen students could n't afford to pay for tuition , school officials eliminated it .\n`` Berea College has not been collecting tuition from students since 1892 , '' says Jeff Amburgey , Berea 's vice president of finance .\nTo cover costs without tuition revenue , Berea 's board of trustees did something almost 100 years ago that impacts its financial situation today . In 1920 , the board ruled that any unrestricted money given to the college would be invested in an endowment to grow over time .\nThe endowment is now worth around $ 1.2 billion , and profits from the investments cover a large portion of what it costs to educate more than 1,600 students .\nMost students come from Appalachia . They all come from low-income families . And none pays for tuition .\n`` A lot of people say , 'This has got ta be fake . ' But I came here . And it 's legit , '' says 22-year-old Hollie Jameson , who is finishing a nursing degree . She 's the first in her family to go to college . `` I will leave in May of 2020 with a free education as an RN . Absolutely no debt . ''\nThat 's not normal . At least , not compared with her hometown friends . Jameson says , `` I have friends in nursing schools here in Kentucky that say , 'Oh , my gosh , you 're so lucky . Like , I already have $ 20,000 in debt and I 'm where you are , and you have zero . ' ``\nTakeaway No . 1 : If a college does n't have one already , it should fund an endowment designed to reduce the cost of tuition .\nStill , even with good investment decisions and some luck , it could take 50 to 75 years before an endowment completely offsets tuition revenue .\nFor the impatient who ca n't wait for 75 years , the next example \u2014 Alice Lloyd College \u2014 shows what 's possible without a massive endowment .\nThe school started when Alice Lloyd relocated in the early 1900s from New England to the town of Pippa Passes in eastern Kentucky . An Appalachian mountain man persuaded her to educate the local kids . He gave her a barren strip of land along a creek , where Lloyd founded a school that would grow into a college .\nLocals had no money for tuition , and students were n't asked to pay . Instead , they provided labor , building the campus and staffing it .\nMoney was always tight . In perhaps its most famous fundraising windfall , Lloyd appeared on the show This Is Your Life in 1955 . At the end , the host asked viewers to send a few dollars to the college . Bags of mail overwhelmed the local post office , delivering around $ 200,000 in donations .\nBut while Lloyd never asked students to pay , she did ask them to go home and serve their neglected communities . Lloyd kept framed pictures of students on the wall . `` If someone chose not to come back , she would turn the picture around backwards , so you could n't see their face , '' says Jim Stepp , executive vice president at Alice Lloyd College .\nToday , the college serves around 600 mostly low-income students . According to Stepp , about 85 % of alumni return to live and work in Appalachia .\nTaLaura Mathis , 21 , from Manchester , Ky. , is finishing a degree in biology . Next , she plans to study dentistry . `` Where I come from , it 's very poverty-stricken , '' says Mathis . `` I really want to help blue-collar , hardworking people that just ca n't afford dentistry . ''\nStudent like Mathis are able to study at Alice Lloyd because of its unconventional budgeting method .\n`` When you begin with the concept that you 're not going to charge out-of-pocket tuition , everything you do has to be built around that concept , '' says Stepp .\nThe college has a decent endowment , worth around $ 44 million . Alice Lloyd also relies heavily on fundraising .\nProfessors teach a heavier class load than at similar colleges . Also , Alice Lloyd does n't give tenure , which might spark a revolt at other schools .\nBut there is one thing other colleges could learn from Alice Lloyd \u2014 the way it pays for new buildings .\n`` Typically , when colleges build buildings and they go into a lot of debt , you build that into tuition costs . Students have to bear that ultimately , '' says Stepp . `` Here , we raise the money from private donors before we build . ''\nOn a campus tour , marketing director Katie Westerfield points out a new recreational center with a 550-seat gymnasium , which is still under construction .\n`` Even though it is not completed and wo n't be until the end of 2019 , [ this building ] is fully funded at $ 20 million , '' says Westerfield .\nStepp says he understands how competition for students can make new facilities seem urgent . At the same time , he wonders , `` How much debt should a college really go into as an institution ? Do you need to put as much money into the facilities when students ultimately are going to pay for that through tuition ? ''\nTakeaway No . 2 : Do n't do debt \u2014 it 's too expensive .\nFinally , the last lesson is really more like a caution .\nAlice Lloyd and Berea do something that , at first glance , may seem like a good way for a college to save money . Both are work colleges \u2014 requiring students to work at least 10 hours a week .\nThe act of working is considered more important than learning any specific skill . Many students come from tiny towns where jobs are scarce . So these college labor programs may be a student 's introduction to the culture of work .\nAdministrators at both Berea and Alice Lloyd praise the work program for building character , instilling values and helping young adults develop a professional mindset .\nOn the downside , students often work just two- or three-hour shifts . And every year , when seniors graduate , a quarter of the workforce must be replaced and trained all over again .\n`` It 's not one of those items you would implement to offset some financial difficulties , '' says Berea 's Amburgey .\nAnd while college labor programs receive some federal funds , he says , `` It is a lot of work to do this . It costs money to [ run ] the labor program . ''\nSome colleges have tried to adopt the work-college approach only to give up because implementing the labor program was too expensive .\nAlso , research suggests that the work-college model is best suited for smaller institutions . In a chapter titled `` 'Work Colleges ' as an Alternative to Student Loan Debt '' in The Neoliberal Agenda and the Student Debt Crisis in U.S. Higher Education , Nicholas Hartlep , chair of Berea 's Education Studies department , and Diane Dean , an Illinois State University associate professor , write , `` creating mandatory jobs for all students may not be feasible in institutions that have larger enrollments .
