This is the core strength of conservatism, and it is the message that will save this nation from the bureaucratic central planners destroying it right now.\n\nWhile there are differences of opinion on certain policy issues, there is a common foundation all conservatives share and that is a love and commitment to freedom. Liberals projecting their own identity crisis on their opponents got a bit of a shock from the vision emerging out of CPAC. Whether it be Scott Walker or Mia Love or Carly Fiorina, Americans heard messages about freedom, speaking up and pushing back. There will be no more ceding the moral high ground to liberals.\n\nVery often you hear the legacy media, liberal social and political groups and Democrat politicians insist there is a \u201ccivil war\u201d among conservatives about what the term even means. They wish. Fulminating about the tea party being against someone, or libertarians against everyone, or gasp, Sarah Palin makes another speech. Anything to distract you from your own strength.
