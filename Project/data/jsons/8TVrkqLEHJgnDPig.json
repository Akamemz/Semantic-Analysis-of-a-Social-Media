The U.S. political system is a presidential system based on the division of powers . South Korea has the same type of political system.The basic difference between the presidential and parliamentary systems is that in the former , the head of the executive body is the head of state and exercises stronger power than the legislative and judicial branches in reality . In the cabinet system it is very difficult for the head of government to exercise the same degree of power . Moreover , the presidential term is fixed , while that of the prime minister in the cabinet system is not.All the Western European countries except France are based on the cabinet system and , in many cases , the cabinet is formed by a coalition of parties . In contrast , under a presidential system , the president is in complete control of the executive branch . In view of these differences , it is not difficult to see why two-party politics is more prevalent under presidential systems than parliamentary system , where multiparty politics is more common . This is the main reason major political parties in the presidential system engage in a cutthroat struggle with each other to occupy the presidency , while minor parties are helpless.Another reason American and South Korean politics are becoming more polarized is that the conservative and liberal parties in both countries have almost diametrically opposed views and advocate quite different policies in the above-mentioned fields .

Only in the security field do they differ.America \u2019 s main security interest is global , whereas South Korea \u2019 s main security concerns are regional and inter-Korean relations . Therefore , their security strategies are bound to be different . The Korean conservatives and the liberals are divided on how to deal with North Korea.One noteworthy phenomenon is that in both countries the number of swing voters is increasing . In South Korea , approximately 31 percent of the people were conservatives , 29 percent liberals and 35 percent were in the middle in 2010 , while their percentages changed to 29 , 21 and 47 respectively in 2015.A similar phenomenon has happened in America : Less than 30 percent of voters identify themselves with the Republican Party and less than 30 percent with the Democratic Party , while more than 40 percent see themselves as unaligned . Another similarity is that in both countries the sizes of the middle classes have decreased recently and the people in the middle class have become more distrustful of both the conservative and liberal parties , becoming independent or apolitical.This phenomenon is closely related to the fact that the people of the middle class in both countries are more distrustful of their respective governments than people of the upper and lower class . It does not necessarily mean that the upper and lower class peoples in both countries are trustful of their respective governments.Overall , voters in both countries have become more distrustful of their respective governments , including the executive and the legislative bodies .
