But in some ways , it was a surprising choice : He had just returned to Washington from cancer treatment to vote in favor of a motion to proceed on Obamacare repeal efforts . Yet just a few days later , he was opposing the legislation .\nSome of McCain \u2019 s liberal sympathizers came up with a compelling story to explain it : By voting for the motion to proceed , and against the actually skinny repeal proposal itself , McCain had blocked Republicans from using budget reconciliation to pass any legislation in 2017 . In this telling , McCain didn \u2019 t just block the health care proposal he voted against \u2014 he made it impossible for Republicans to repeal Obamacare while avoiding a filibuster , because any additional health care plans would need 60 votes in the Senate . Here \u2019 s a version of the highly viral Reddit post that explained this theory :\nAmazing . Also clear now that McCain 's yes on motion to proceed is what killed the bill . https : //t.co/4CRz8VABeE pic.twitter.com/jzqVqmiZmJ \u2014 Steve Simitzis \u24cb ( @ s5 ) July 28 , 2017\nThe only problem is that none of this is true . Republicans \u2019 plan to use budget reconciliation to pass health reform and tax reform still works , as a matter of Senate rules . They can still move legislation with only 50 votes .\nNone of the health proposals rejected in the Senate \u2014 not the Better Care Reconciliation Act ( BCRA ) ( the repeal-and-replace plan that Republicans had been crafting for months ) , nor Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act ( which would have entirely repealed all the coverage and tax parts of Obamacare ) , nor the Health Care Freedom Act ( skinny repeal , targeting the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax but leaving most of the rest of Obamacare in place ) \u2014 were actual bills . All of those were amendments to an underlying bill , the American Health Care Act .\nBecause that underlying bill has not failed yet , the Obamacare repeal effort can still proceed through reconciliation .\n\u201c The failed vote was on the \u2018 skinny repeal \u2019 amendment , not on passage of the bill , \u201d Alan Frumin , who served as parliamentarian of the United States Senate from 1987 to 1995 and then from 2001 to 2012 , including during the original Obamacare fight , says ( emphasis his ) . \u201c The reconciliation bill , H.R . 1628 , is on the calendar , reachable on a non-debatable majority vote motion to proceed ; all 20 hours of debate have expired ; amendments are still in order . \u201d\nIn other words , the Senate can still pass a health care bill with a bare majority and avoid a Democratic filibuster . All Republicans have to do is come up with a plan .\nShortly after Donald Trump 's shocking victory , congressional Republicans in November 2016 devised a strategy that would enable them to achieve their two biggest legislative priorities : repealing the Affordable Care Act and slashing tax rates .\nThe plan would proceed in two steps . First , Congress would pass a dummy budget resolution as soon as it convened . What that resolution said about spending wouldn \u2019 t matter ; all that mattered was that it contained \u201c reconciliation instructions. \u201d Those instruct committees in each house to produce legislation . Democrats could not filibuster that legislation as long as it stuck to a given set of budget-related topics . So the legislation could pass the Senate with 51 votes , or even 50 plus the vice president , without needing any Democratic support .\nThe plan was to use this power to quickly pass an Obamacare repeal bill along party lines , hopefully by spring . Then Congress would pass another , real budget , with detailed spending levels and more reconciliation instructions . This time , reconciliation would be used to pass a big tax reform package , cutting rates for individuals and corporations , among other big changes . This , too , could pass with only Republican support . So Republicans would be able to easily , without any cooperation from Democrats , accomplish two big policy goals .\nThat , obviously , has not happened . The dummy budget was passed swiftly in January . But after repeated attempts , Senate leaders have not been able to come up with a health care bill that would get 50 Republican votes .\nThe process , however , is not over . Republicans can still open debate on the House health care bill again , introduce another health care amendment with a novel proposal ( like Graham-Cassidy , which would block-grant Obamacare money to the states ) , and pass the bill with 50 or 51 votes .\nThe only problem is that reconciliation authority lapses eventually . And no one is entirely sure when \u201c eventually \u201d is .\nThe reconciliation process is tied to budget resolutions , and currently Congress is operating on the fiscal year 2017 budget they passed in January . The reconciliation instructions are clearly usable right now . But everything else is a matter of controversy :\nSome think that reconciliation expires on September 30 , 2017 , the last day of FY 2017 . After that , according to this theory , the House and Senate will have to pass a new resolution to pass reconciliation legislation . Others argue that reconciliation doesn \u2019 t expire until a new resolution is passed . Under that theory , Republicans can keep working on health care under the 2017 budget as long as they like , so long as they don \u2019 t pass a FY 2018 budget resolution with separate reconciliation instructions in the meantime . Still others have contended that Congress could pass a FY 2018 budget resolution and still work on its FY 2017 reconciliation bill . This would enable them to work on two reconciliation bills simultaneously ; say , health care and tax reform .\nThe budget procedure experts I spoke with thought the second interpretation \u2014 that reconciliation lasts until a new budget resolution is passed \u2014 was the most plausible , but acknowledged there \u2019 s considerable uncertainty on the question . \u201c Many think Sept 30 . Others think not until new resolution passes or 115th Congress adjourns , \u201d Marc Goldwein , senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a leading budget procedure expert , says .\nAsked for comment , Frumin , the former parliamentarian , simply replied , \u201c ? ? ? ? \u201d\nSarah Binder , a professor of political science at George Washington University , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , and a leading congressional procedure expert , says the likeliest option is No . 2 : Reconciliation lasts until the next budget resolution . \u201c My sense has been that a reconciliation bill remains \u2018 alive \u2019 until a conference agreement on the next fiscal year 's budget resolution is adopted by both chambers , \u201d she says , noting that in 2006 , congressional Republicans rushed to pass a tax cut bill through reconciliation before a FY 2007 budget resolution was adopted .\n`` Once that occurred , '' according to a contemporaneous article in CQ Almanac , `` the reconciliation protections afforded the tax bill in the fiscal 2006 resolution would end . ''\n\u201c I suppose it 's possible that the parliamentarian would advise that the bill \u2018 expires \u2019 Sept. 30 at the end of FY17 regardless of whether or not a FY18 budget resolution has been adopted , but I 'm skeptical , \u201d Binder continues . \u201c We are on uncharted ground . The Congressional Budget Act does n't explicitly address this , and so the question is subject to interpretation by the parliamentarian . \u201d\nReporting by my colleague Tara Golshan suggests that most congressional Republicans also buy the interpretation wherein they can pass something until a new 2018 resolution is prepared ; you don \u2019 t need to pass a budget to keep the government funded , so Congress could under this interpretation just keep delaying a new resolution until they \u2019 re done with health care and want to move on .\nThat gives Republicans lots of time , if they want it , to try to craft yet another Obamacare repeal package . The main obstacle isn \u2019 t the rules but the actual viewpoints of Republican senators , and the fact that the most persuadable person on the issue , John McCain , is not going to be in Washington for weeks , if not months .\nIt \u2019 s possible , however , that Republicans will eventually want to just cut their losses and move on from health reform to tax reform . To do that , though , they \u2019 d likely need to pass a new budget resolution first .\nThe problem is that Republicans are halfway through the process . The House has already passed its reconciliation bill , the American Health Care Act . But the 2017 budget resolution that started this process in the first place required significant savings from two Senate committees : the Finance Committee and the Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee . Tax reform isn \u2019 t likely to involve the latter committee at all .\nThe Senate bill also has to save about as much money as the House bill ( $ 133 billion in on-budget savings over 10 years ) . Tax reform is meant to be budget-neutral , not deficit-reducing , which makes reaching that number through tax provisions very tough .\nCongress could react by passing a new fiscal year 2017 budget with different instructions , wiping the slate clean . But it \u2019 d probably be easier to just move ahead with the fiscal year 2018 budget . After all , if they \u2019 ve given up on health care , then tax reform is basically the only major priority they have left . They can include changes to social safety net programs to pay for tax cuts , if they want to reform food stamps , Supplemental Security Income , and the like in the process . Once they conceded defeat on health care , they would only really need one reconciliation bill to try to do tax reform with .\nOf course , tax reform is itself a massively complex undertaking that could prove just as difficult to crack as health care has . But that \u2019 s a matter of politics , not Senate rules . The rules are clear that Republicans can use reconciliation to pass permanent tax changes ( provided they don \u2019 t increase the deficit after 10 years ) with only 50 votes .\nAre you an Obamacare enrollee interested in what happens next ?
