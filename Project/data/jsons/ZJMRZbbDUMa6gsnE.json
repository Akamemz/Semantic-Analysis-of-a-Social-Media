More than a half-dozen friends and advisers to the two , speaking mostly anonymously to reveal private and frank conversations , said the Murdoch-Romney relationship could be summed up simply : They do not have much of one .\nThey have met only a handful of times . Their lukewarm feelings toward each other stem from their encounter at a meeting of The Journal editorial board in 2007 , when Mr. Romney visited to pitch himself as the most capable conservative candidate about two months before the Iowa caucuses .\nRomney and Journal staff members who attended said that despite being deeply prepared and animated \u2014 particularly on his love for data crunching \u2014 Mr. Romney failed to connect with either Mr. Murdoch or The Journal \u2019 s editorial page editor , Paul A. Gigot . Instead of articulating a clear and consistent conservative philosophy , he dwelled on organizational charts and executive management , areas of expertise that made him a multimillionaire as the head of his private equity firm , Bain Capital .\nAt one point , Mr. Romney declared that \u201c I would probably bring in McKinsey , \u201d the management consulting firm , to help him set up his presidential cabinet , a comment that seemed to startle the editors and left Mr. Murdoch visibly taken aback .\nThe Journal \u2019 s write-up of that meeting would later glibly refer to Mr. Romney as \u201c Consultant in Chief . \u201d\nMr. Romney followed up later in the campaign with a second meeting in Mr. Murdoch \u2019 s office , but that , too , failed to light a spark . \u201c I don \u2019 t think he ever got excited about Romney , \u201d said one associate of Mr. Murdoch \u2019 s .\nBy the time the first Republican primaries of 2012 were closing in , Mr. Romney met again with The Journal \u2019 s editorial board .
