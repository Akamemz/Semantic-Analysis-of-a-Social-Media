    "content": "A recent New York Times story that slams the free market approach to education policy is rife with inaccuracies . Amazingly , the author of the piece misrepresents the very data she is using to build her erroneous case against school choice .\n`` Free Market for Education ? Economists Generally Do n't Buy It , '' claims Susan Dynarski , a professor of education , public policy , and economics at the University of Michigan , in The Times . This is a betrayal of expectations , according to Dynarski , because economists generally understand that free markets produce better outcomes than central planners ( much to the chagrin of education professors ) . Economists are usually the ones calling for less regulation and more unrestricted capitalism ; if they 're super conflicted about markets in education , that would be a serious indictment of the school choice approach . Dynarski writes :\nYou might think that most economists agree with this overall approach , because economists generally like free markets . For example , over 90 percent of the members of the University of Chicago 's panel of leading economists thought that ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft made consumers better off by providing competition for the highly regulated taxi industry . But economists are far less optimistic about what an unfettered market can achieve in education . Only a third of economists on the Chicago panel agreed that students would be better off if they all had access to vouchers to use at any private ( or public ) school of their choice .\nThat does sound bad for school choice\u2014it suggests that two-thirds of surveyed economists disagree that students with vouchers would be better off .\nA chunk of economists\u201437 percent\u2014could n't say for sure whether vouches would improve educational outcomes . That 's not so surprising : education reform is a complicated issue and economists are thorough , cautious people . Moreover , it 's true that vouchers do n't always make things better for every kid\u2014providing more choices is not the same thing as magically reversing decades of poverty , racial inequality , and bad incentives .\nBut among economists who did take a position on the issue , school vouchers were a big winner . As Slate Star Codex explains :\n36 % of economists agree that vouchers would improve education , compared to 19 % who disagree . The rest are unsure or did n't answer the question . The picture looks about the same when weighted by the economists ' confidence . A more accurate way to summarize this graph is `` About twice as many economists believe a voucher system would improve education as believe that it would n't . '' By leaving it at `` only a third of economists support vouchers '' , the article implies that there is an economic consensus against the policy . Heck , it more than implies it \u2013 its title is `` Free Market For Education : Economists Generally Do n't Buy It '' . But its own source suggests that , of economists who have an opinion , a large majority are pro-voucher . ( note also that the options are only `` agree that vouchers will improve education '' and `` disagree that vouchers will improve education '' , so that it 's unclear from the data if any dissenting economists agree with the Times ' position that vouchers will make things worse . They might just think that things would stay the same . ) I think this is really poor journalistic practice and implies the opinion of the nation 's economists to be the opposite of what it really is . I hope the Times prints a correction .\nI would also note that I read through most of the surveyed economists ' comments , and it seems pretty clear that those who were `` uncertain '' did think school vouchers would improve outcomes for a lot of kids ; they just thought it was hard to quantify the overall effect . `` I think the majority of public school students would be better off , but certainly not all , '' wrote one economist . `` The question is ambiguous about the percent . '' You can judge for yourself whether the responses should be further weighted toward the pro-voucher position .\nBut that 's not even everything that 's wrong with the article . Having smeared school choice as something the Trump administration will push despite the learned skepticism of `` economists generally , '' Dynarski then goes on to point out a number other policy issues where the consensus is against the free market :\nWhile economists are trained about the value of free markets , they are also trained to spot when markets ca n't work alone and government intervention is required . A classic example is pollution . Factories and cars that spew toxins ruin the air for everyone . Pollution is what economists call a `` negative externality '' : Drivers get the benefits of the gas they burn when they drive to work , but everyone else gets the bad emissions . Economists recommend governments use taxes and regulations to minimize this negative externality . In most markets , in fact , economists advocate striking a balance between free competition and regulation . While they vary considerably in where they would strike that balance , it 's unusual for an economist to claim that private markets can serve every need without any government intervention at all .\nAt this point I 'm not sure readers should trust Dynarski 's impression of what economists think\u2014and in fact , there are plenty of economists who say markets and property rights would reduce all sorts of environmental problems\u2014but let 's assume she 's right : Economists agree that there are some things the free market just ca n't handle on its own . *\nEarlier , Dynarski associated the free market position with school vouchers . Now she is saying that the free market position is `` private markets can serve every need without any government intervention at all . '' That 's an incredible contradiction . Dynarski , I suppose , wants her readers to believe that school vouchers are an anarcho-capitalist delusion that would gut public education and leave children to become feral and illiterate . In reality , school vouchers represent exactly the sort of `` balance between free market competition and regulation '' that economists support . Under a voucher system , education is still publicly funded . Many schools are still run by the government . Those that are not explicitly run by the government are still subjected to considerable regulation .\nDynarski is making the case that smart , reasonable people support market competition as long as it 's accompanied by significant government intervention . Dynarski is also , for some \u2588\u2588\u2588 , making the case against school vouchers\u2014even though vouchers are the perfect example of the kind of thing she claims is smart and reasonable .\nSupporters of school choice are not extremists . They do not want to destroy public funding for education , or leave children to fend for themselves . They have merely observed that a specific model\u2014forcing kids to attend a specific school that comports with the zip code assigned to them at birth\u2014is inefficient , immoral , and prone to abuse . There has been too much top-down government management , and not enough competition , in the American education system . Reforms , like the voucher system , are a necessary corrective . They provide balance between government and privatization .\nIf you 're against this kind of thing , it 's your own views that are squarely at odds with most economists .\nBut wait , there 's more .
