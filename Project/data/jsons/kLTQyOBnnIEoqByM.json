It 's more a review of the decisions she made as the nation 's top diplomat .\nThat the book looks backward is proof , she said , that it 's not a campaign document because , echoing an often-used line of her husband , former President Bill Clinton , `` I 'm experienced enough to know that political campaigns are about the future , not the past . ''\nBut she acknowledged that the book tour gives her a chance `` to work really hard to get out around the country to talk about what 's on people 's minds . '' In short , it sounds like she 's embarking on another listening tour of the kind she used to launch her career in electoral politics in 1999 before she ran for a U.S. Senate seat from New York .\nIn any event , a review of her years traveling the globe as secretary of state during President Obama 's first term gives her the chance to define her accomplishments even as her Republican critics ask , `` What achievements ?

We were flat on our back when I walked in there the first time .\n`` We were viewed as being untrustworthy , as violating our moral rules and values , as being economically hobbled . And we had to get out there and once again promote American values and pursue our interests and protect national security . Because of the eight years that preceded us \u2014 it was the economic collapse , it was two wars , it was the war on terror that led to some very unfortunate , un-American actions being taken .
