The famous three-step strategy that every campaign attempts to implement was popularized by former congressman Dave Nagle and is often summarized as : Organize , organize , and get hot at the end .

In 2008 , the late surges of Barack Obama , who won , and John Edwards , who zipped past Hillary Clinton , were visible in their final crowds .
