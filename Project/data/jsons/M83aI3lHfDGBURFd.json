Last evening we highlighted new Romney-friendly numbers out of Wisconsin and Michigan -- states Obama won in 2008 by 14 and 16 points, respectively. Today we're seeing more polling data from Florida and Nevada:\n\n\n\nA new Gravis Marketing survey shows Mitt Romney leading Barack Obama, 49%-45%, in Florida. Other stats of note: Romney wins both Catholics and Protestants, while Obama wins religious affiliations outside of those two groups, non-affiliated voters, and Jews. This is the latest in a series of strong swing state polls for Romney, and the third consecutive poll showing him slightly ahead in Florida.\n\n\n\nThe Sunshine State remains a crucial and heavy lift for Romney, but it appears early analysis that Republicans could \"kiss Florida goodbye\" due to the Ryan pick was misplaced and premature.
