No cellphones , no talking allowed for senators in the chamber . For reporters , no \u201c walk and talk \u201d interviews with senators in the hallways . Instead , the media were to be confined to roped-off pens at the Senate exits .\nBut like water flowing downhill , it \u2019 s hard to stop lawmakers and media from finding each other , or senators from getting their message out .\n\u201c Any political figure that has something to say will find a way to say it . If they want the press to find them , they will be found , \u201d says Mo Elleithee , former communications director for the Democratic National Committee , and now at Georgetown University .\nDuring an afternoon break on Wednesday , at least seven senators stopped to talk with reporters penned behind ropes and stanchions near a Senate exit . Democratic presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota advised her Republican colleagues to \u201c start acting like a juror \u201d and allow witnesses in the trial . Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas declared \u201c nothing new \u201d after more than two hours of opening arguments .\nThe arguments were a \u201c tour de force ! \u201d responded Minority Leader Charles Schumer , waiting for Senator Cornyn to finish so he could have his say . The New Yorker made sure to repeat his message in front of television cameras and other media at a stakeout near the Senate basement .\nSenators from both sides are talking informally with reporters in these locations and elsewhere , as well as holding press conferences and doing television interviews . Most notably , many are filing daily updates on Twitter , including sharing tips on how they are enduring hours on end of presentations .\nFood and drink other than water ( plain or fizzy ) or milk ( originally for health reasons ) are forbidden in the chamber . Sen. Chris Murphy , a Democrat from Connecticut , joked on Twitter that \u201c milk is the big news today , \u201d as his seatmate , Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , went for the white stuff . He also shared an impeachment survival trick : \u201c During the short breaks , unwrap a few hard candies and put them in your desk drawer . That way you avoid the noise of unwrapping them when you sneak one mid-trial . \u201d\nMany Democrats have been sharing their views of the day \u2019 s events in brief , conversational videos that they post to Twitter , speaking directly to constituents . \u201c It was a long , long day and night last night , \u201d started out Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama , the most endangered Democrat in the Senate , on Wednesday .\n\u201c Yesterday was bananas , \u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris of California , a Democratic presidential candidate , in another Twitter video . In a brief interview later , she explains that the videos are meant to \u201c keep people engaged , and to remind them that they are part of this process ... and what it \u2019 s really like . \u201d\nThe video strategy fits with today \u2019 s reality TV ethos , says Mr. Elleithee , where people want to see more than fixed cameras focused on the Senate chamber . Democrats want voters to be invested in the impeachment process , and they are hoping to speak to a broader electorate that includes independents .\nFewer Republicans have been doing speak-to-camera videos . But they \u2019 re still finding ways to get their messages out .\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has been tweeting out a daily diary of sorts . \u201c House began presenting their case over course of 8 hours , \u201d he wrote Wednesday on Twitter . \u201c Offered detailed timeline of the events underpinning their case .

A hard congressional pass allows reporters to roam freely in the corridors of the Capitol and its office buildings . During the trial , senators can visit a pen \u2013 if they choose . But reporters aren \u2019 t able to find other viewpoints when they \u2019 re locked into a few square feet for 30 minutes or an hour during a break .\nLawmakers can jump over the media , but \u201c what we say has more credibility , I would hope , \u201d says veteran New York Times reporter Carl Hulse . \u201c We \u2019 re serving a real purpose here , trying to sort out a pretty confusing mess that a lot of people don \u2019 t understand . \u201d\nThe restrictions have forced news organizations to adjust , taking more time to try to reach senators by phone and adding reporters to be in more places to try to catch them . That \u2019 s doable for a news giant like The New York Times , but it \u2019 s harder for smaller outlets .\nTake the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette . It has one reporter on the Hill , Daniel Moore . \u201c The restrictions make it really difficult , \u201d he says , preventing him from getting \u201c anything meaningful \u201d from either of the senators he covers from the swing state of Pennsylvania \u2013 Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey .\nAs of Day 3 of the trial , Mr. Moore had not been able to reach either senator during a break or on the phone .

When swarmed by reporters as he entered the Capitol \u2019 s internal subway , the senator commented only that the candy in the Senate cloakroom was running low .\nMr. Moore had better success on Thursday , speaking with Senator Casey on a phone press conference for Pennsylvania reporters , and gleaning some insight on Senator Toomey \u2019 s views from a television interview .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want this to sound just like reporters whining , \u201d says Sarah Wire , who is chair of the Standing Committee of Correspondents on the Hill . \u201c We have a responsibility to the American people , to our readers and to viewers , and that \u2019 s my concern . \u201d\nStill , since the trial started , things have loosened up a bit \u2013 both on the Senate floor and with journalists .
