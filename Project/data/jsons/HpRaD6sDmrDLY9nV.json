When a new president is on the way , traditional adversaries might test the waters a bit by , say , seizing a U.S. unmanned research drone . Just to see what happens .

And here comes Trump , freaking the hell out of everybody .\nAs Trump veers from one surprise tweet to the next\u2014at times misspelled 140-character statements that seem to contradict decades of U.S. foreign policy , State Department bureaucrats are facing a unique challenge : How to follow the lead of a president who seems uninterested in consistency , protocol and nuance ? In Trump \u2019 s November phone call to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , for example , he called Pakistan a \u201c fantastic country , fantastic place of fantastic people , \u201d neglecting to mention Pakistan \u2019 s involvement in fomenting terrorism against U.S. interests , a major point of tension for American presidents since Al Qaeda and its affiliates set up shop in Pakistan after the September 11 attacks . On December 2 , Trump spoke by phone with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen , a move breaking with nearly four decades of protocol in U.S.-China relations . This seemingly impulsive personal style makes it extremely difficult for the State Department bureaucracy to interpret Trump and follow his example .
