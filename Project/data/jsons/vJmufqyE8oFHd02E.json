President Barack Obama barely mentioned Friday\u2019s weak jobs numbers and said he\u2019s leading a recovery from an economic hole he didn\u2019t create. Mitt Romney said the president has not done enough to help the economy over three and a half years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe lofty rhetoric on display at the party conventions in Tampa and Charlotte the past two weeks gave way within hours to more familiar campaign attacks at events in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada.\n\nSure, the president worked in a reference to the 30th straight month of private sector job growth during a New Hampshire stump speech, but the thrust of his remarks echoed what he\u2019d said the night before at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C.\n\n\u201cLast night, I did my best to lay out the stakes in this election,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, now that both sides have made their argument, there\u2019s a big choice to make. And I honestly believe this is the biggest choice, the clearest choice, of any time in our generation, because it\u2019s not just a choice between two candidates or two political parties.

Each would hit areas traditionally partial to their side: Obama with an afternoon rally at the University of Iowa here and on New Hampshire\u2019s more liberal Seacoast and Romney in the epicenter of Iowa\u2019s conservative west, and in Nashua, N.H.\n\nRomney\u2019s running mate, Rep.
