Rosa DeLauro ( D-Conn. ) , who \u2019 s become the leader of the opposition to President Barack Obama \u2019 s trade agenda . \u201c You give back the toys at the end . \u201d\nFor those out to sink Obama \u2019 s free trade push , highlighting the lack of public information is becoming central to their opposition strategy : The White House isn \u2019 t even telling Congress what it \u2019 s asking for , they say , or what it \u2019 s already promised foreign governments .\nThe White House has been coordinating an administration-wide lobbying effort that \u2019 s included phone calls and briefings from Secretary of State John Kerry , Labor Secretary Tom Perez , Treasury Secretary Jack Lew , Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and others . Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has been working members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro has been talking to members of his home state Texas delegation .\nOfficials from the White House and the United States trade representative \u2019 s office say they \u2019 ve gone farther than ever before to provide Congress the information it needs and that the transparency complaints are just the latest excuse for people who were never going to vote for a new trade deal anyway .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve worked closely with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to balance unprecedented access to classified documents with the appropriate level of discretion that \u2019 s needed to ensure Americans get the best deal possible in an ongoing , high-stakes international negotiation , \u201d said USTR spokesman Matt McAlvanah .\nObama \u2019 s seeking a renewal of fast-track authority , which would empower him to negotiate trade deals that then go to Congress for up-or-down votes but not amendments . He says he needs that authority to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a 12-country free trade agreement that he calls essential to stopping China from setting trade , labor and environmental standards in the Asia-Pacific region .\nAdministration aides say they can \u2019 t make the details public because the negotiations are still going on with multiple countries at once ; if for example , Vietnam knew what the American bottom line was with Japan , that might drive them to change their own terms . Trade might not seem like a national security issue , they say , but it is ( and foreign governments regularly try to hack their way in to American trade deliberations ) .\nMoreover , many of the leaders of the opposition , administration aides argue , are people who aren \u2019 t used to dealing with classified information and don \u2019 t realize how standard this secrecy is . And by the way , they note , neither congressional conference committees nor labor contract talks allow even this level of access to negotiations while in process .\nBut those arguments aren \u2019 t making much headway among trade skeptics , who feel they are being treated with disrespect and condescension . And they increasingly are pinning the blame directly on United States Trade Representative Mike Froman , who \u2019 s been headlining the classified briefings , in addition to smaller meetings with members .\n\u201c The access to information is totally at the whim of Ambassador Froman , \u201d said Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( D-Texas ) , who \u2019 s a hard no on fast track but says he \u2019 d like to see other ways of promoting international trade . \u201c He likes to make available information that he thinks helps his case , and if it conflicts , then he doesn \u2019 t make the information available , \u201d Doggett said .\nDoggett , like other critics , pointed out that the cover sheets of the trade documents in that basement room are marked only \u201c confidential document \u201d and note they \u2019 re able to be transmitted over unsecured email and fax \u2014 but for some reason are still restricted to members of Congress .\n\u201c My chief of staff who has a top secret security clearance can learn more about ISIS or Yemen than about this trade agreement , \u201d Doggett said .\n\u201c He \u2019 s incredibly condescending . It \u2019 s like , \u2018 You \u2019 d be all for this if only you hadn \u2019 t gotten an F in economics , \u2019 \u201d said Rep. Brad Sherman ( D-Calif. ) , who said he \u2019 s opposed to what he \u2019 s seen because it lacks labor standards and measures to address currency manipulation .\n\u201c We know when we \u2019 re being suckered , \u201d said Rep. Alan Grayson ( D-Fla. ) , who said he believes that the USTR quotes percentages instead of absolute values on trade statistics that give an overly positive impression . \u201c It \u2019 s not only condescending , it \u2019 s misleading . \u201d\nAsked about those criticisms , Froman responded by praising his adversaries .\n\u201c I have great respect for the critics , many of whom have shown great leadership on progressive causes , and I look forward to a continued dialogue with members of Congress based on facts and substance , \u201d Froman told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nRep. Ron Kind ( D-Wis. ) , who supports giving Obama fast-track authority , says the division among Democrats is between members who are looking for a reason to say no and those that are actually trying to work on the deal .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve been very engaging with Congress and to members who want to be in the room and engaging them on the text \u2026 so we can ask questions but , more importantly , so we can provide input , \u201d Kind said .\nAs for Froman , Kind said , \u201c he \u2019 s very cordial , he \u2019 s very respectful and listening to other people \u2019 s opinion . \u2026 I don \u2019 t get a sense of condescension and arrogance . \u201d\nKind says he expects several more Democrats to announce their support for the president \u2019 s efforts in the coming days , some of them because of what they \u2019 ve heard from Froman .\nDoggett insisted that the outreach is costing the White House support .\n\u201c The more people hear Ambassador Froman but feel they get less than candid and accurate answers , I think it loses votes for them , \u201d Doggett said .\nAdministration officials point to other members who \u2019 ve publicly praised Froman for his responsiveness and his accessibility .
