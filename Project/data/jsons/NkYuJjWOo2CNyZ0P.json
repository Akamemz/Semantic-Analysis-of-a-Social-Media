' But he stands by his decision on the Clinton probe .\nFBI Director James Comey returned to the Hill on Wednesday to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee , one day after Hillary Clinton blamed him for upending her presidential campaign and the morning after President Donald Trump declared Comey \u201c the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nComey opened up about why he sent his Oct. 28 letter about new evidence in the Clinton probe . It came down to \u201c speak \u201d or \u201c conceal , \u201d Comey said . \u201c Speak , \u201d he reasoned , \u201c would be really bad . There \u2019 s an election in 11 days . Lordy , that would be really bad . Concealing in my view would be catastrophic , not just to the FBI but well beyond . And , honestly , as between really bad and catastrophic , I said to my team : \u2018 We \u2019 ve got to walk into the world of really bad . I \u2019 ve got to tell Congress that we \u2019 re restarting this , not in some frivolous way \u2014 in a hugely significant way . \u201d\nSending that letter to Congress was \u201c one of the world \u2019 s most painful experiences , \u201d the FBI director said . \u201c It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election , but honestly , it wouldn \u2019 t change the decision , \u201d he said . \u201c Even in hindsight \u2014 and this has been one of the world \u2019 s most painful experiences \u2014 I would make the same decision . I would not conceal that . \u201d\n\u201c Was it appropriate for you to comment on one investigation repeatedly and not say anything about the other ? \u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) asked , questioning whether it was fair to speak on Clinton \u2019 s email probe but stay quiet about the Trump-Russia investigation during the campaign . \u201c I think so , \u201d Comey replied .\nBut there won \u2019 t be another \u201c peep \u201d about the Trump investigation , according to Comey , who insisted he treated investigations into both Trump and Clinton \u201c consistently under the same principles \u201d and suggested that will continue to be the case . \u201c With respect to the Russia investigation , we treated it like we did with the Clinton investigation , \u201d Comey said . \u201c We didn \u2019 t say a word about it until months into it , and then the only thing we \u2019 ve confirmed so far about this is the same thing with the Clinton investigation : that we are investigating , and I would expect we \u2019 re not gon na say another peep about it until we \u2019 re done . And I don \u2019 t know what \u2019 ll be said when we \u2019 re done , but that \u2019 s the way we handled the Clinton investigation as well . \u201d\nComey denied giving Clinton a \u201c free pass , \u201d as the president \u2019 s tweet claimed . \u201c No , that was not my intention , certainly , \u201d Comey said . \u201c We conducted a competent , honest and independent investigation , closed it while offering transparency to the American people . I believed what I said : There was not a prosecutable case there . \u201d\nComey used the term \u201c intelligence porn \u201d to describe WikiLeaks , which published stolen emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee during the campaign . \u201c It crosses a line when it moves from being about trying to educate a public and instead just becomes about intelligence porn , frankly , just pushing out information about sources and methods without regard to interest , without regard to the First Amendment values that normally underlie press reporting and simply becomes a conduit for the Russian intelligence services or some other adversary of the United States just to push out information to damage the United States , \u201d he said .\nComey said Russia backed Trump because he wasn \u2019 t Clinton . \u201c He wasn \u2019 t Hillary Clinton , who [ Russian President Vladimir ] Putin hated and wanted to harm in any possible way , \u201d Comey said , adding that \u201c Putin believed he would be more able to make deals , reach agreements with someone with a business background than someone who had grown up in more of a government environment . \u201d\nRussia will continue to interfere in U.S. elections , Comey predicted . \u201c I think one of the lessons that the Russians may have drawn from this is that this works , and so as I said last month or so ago , I expect to see them back in 2018 , especially in 2020 , \u201d he said . Russia , in his view , is \u201c the greatest threat of any nation on earth given their intention and their capability . \u201d\nComey said the impromptu meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton was the \u201c capper \u201d for him . \u201c A number of things had gone on \u2026 that made me worry that the department leadership could not credibly complete the investigation and decline prosecution without grievous damage to the American people \u2019 s confidence in the justice system , \u201d he said . \u201c I then said : \u2018 You know what , the department can not by itself credibly end this . The best chance we have as a justice system is if I do something I never imagined before : step away from them and tell the American people \u2019 \u201d what the FBI did and what it found .\nIt was a \u201c hard call \u201d to keep Lynch out of the loop on the FBI \u2019 s conclusion , said Comey , who phoned the attorney general the morning of his planned July news conference at which he recommended no charges against Clinton . \u201c That was a hard call for me to make to call the attorney general that morning and say : \u2018 I \u2019 m about to do a press conference and I \u2019 m not gon na tell you what I \u2019 m gon na say , \u2019 \u201d he testified . \u201c And I said to her , \u2018 I hope you \u2019 ll understand someday why I think I have to do this. \u2019 But look , I wasn \u2019 t loving this . I knew this would be disastrous for me personally , but I thought this is the best way to protect these institutions that we care so much about . \u201d\n\u201c Never \u201d has Comey leaked information , he said in response to pointed questioning from Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , nor has he ever authorized anyone to leak information to the press regarding its investigation . Comey , however , wouldn \u2019 t say whether the agency is investigating leaks within the intelligence community . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to answer that question for reasons I think you know , \u201d he said .\nBut Comey did commit to cracking down on leaks . \u201c If I find out that people were leaking information about our investigations , whether to reporters or to private parties , there \u2019 ll be severe consequences , \u201d he warned .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
