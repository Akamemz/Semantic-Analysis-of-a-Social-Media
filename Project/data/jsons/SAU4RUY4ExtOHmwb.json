Marco Rubio , the Cuban-American and Florida Republican who has emerged as the most vocal critic of the administration \u2019 s move this week to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba .\nA clearly prepared White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters at Thursday \u2019 s daily briefing that Mr. Rubio \u2019 s own past statements on diplomatic relationships with other dictatorial regimes conflicted with his harsh remarks on re-opening ties with Havana .\n\u201c It occurs to me that it seems odd Sen. Rubio would be reluctant and , in fact , actively seeking to block the appointment of an ambassador to Cuba when earlier this year he voted to confirm the ambassador to China that the president nominated , \u201d Mr .
