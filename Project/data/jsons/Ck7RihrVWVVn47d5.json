And what it shows affirms what has been leaked through sources to the media for several weeks : Comey believed that Trump was unduly attempting to influence an investigation , that he wanted Comey 's `` loyalty , '' and that he wanted Comey to somehow clear the Russia discussion off the table .\nThe full seven-page document may be read here . But below are some pivotal highlights .\nComey establishes early on that did n't ever feel compelled to document private conversations with President Barack Obama because there were only ever two :\nI felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo . To ensure accuracy , I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting . Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward . This had not been my practice in the past . I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person ( and never on the phone ) \u2014once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time , briefly , for him to say goodbye in late 2016 . In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions . I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months\u2014three in person and six on the phone .\nTrump and Comey 's first one-on-one meeting was at a dinner in the Green Room in the White House . Here is where Comey claims that Trump demanded Comey 's loyalty . The president did n't seem to grasp that the FBI is supposed to maintain a level of independence from the White House :\nI added that I was not `` reliable '' in the way politicians use that word , but he could always count on me to tell him the truth . I added that I was not on anybody 's side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense , a stance I said was in his best interest as the President . A few moments later , the President said , `` I need loyalty , I expect loyalty . '' I did n't move , speak , or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed . We simply looked at each other in silence . The conversation then moved on , but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner .\nAgain Trump said he wanted loyalty . Comey responded that he would offer honesty . Trump apparently decided to combine the words and say that he wanted `` honest loyalty . '' Comey let that sit without correcting further . Trump also asked Comey to consider investigating the whole `` Russian hookers '' story to prove it did n't happen .

He then said , `` I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . '' I replied only that `` he is a good guy .

But Comey also notes that the Justice Department did n't want to make public statements to that effect in the event that circumstances changed and they did have to investigate Trump , because then they 'd have to make another public statement .\nAnd then there 's their final phone call , dated April 11 ( Comey was fired on May 9 ) :\nOn the morning of April 11 , the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I `` get out '' that he is not personally under investigation .
