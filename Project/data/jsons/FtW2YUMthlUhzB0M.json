It warned that if emissions of heat-trapping gases continue at current levels , labor costs in outdoor industries during heat waves could cost $ 155 billion in lost wages per year by 2090 .\nMr. Trump has weathered criticism for his skepticism about climate science since before he won the White House . He provoked fresh attacks from environmentalists for quietly releasing the 1,656-page report on the day after Thanksgiving .\nJust before the report was released , Mr. Trump pointed to record-low temperatures that had been expected in some parts of the country on Thanksgiving .\n\u201c Brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records \u2014 whatever happened to global warming ? \u201d the president wondered on Twitter .\nHowever , the president didn \u2019 t balk at other findings in the report , including that there was no doubt that human activity contributed to the rising temperatures on Earth .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen it . I \u2019 ve read some of it . It \u2019 s fine , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House .\nThe report blamed climate change for worsening natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires , and they predicted as many as 9,300 more people could die each year in the U.S. because of events related to extreme heat and cold .\nBut the scientists said if everyone in coastal regions can learn to adapt to weather as if they were in a climate such as that of Dallas , those fatality rates could be cut in half .\nCritics of the report said it was alarmist , exaggerated the economic impact and focused narrowly on imposing an energy tax to curb carbon dioxide emissions .\nThe president said that preparing for climate change will take more than the U.S. cutting carbon emissions .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to have China and Japan and all of Asia and all of these other countries .
