    "content": "The GOP holds majorities in both houses of Congress , the president is a Republican , and only a tiny minority of the voters support Obamacare in its present form . It should be possible , under these propitious circumstances , for the Republicans to honor their pledge to repeal the rapidly imploding \u201c reform \u201d law . Yet the party that ended slavery and successfully championed women \u2019 s suffrage , both in the face of violent Democratic opposition , can \u2019 t muster the courage to repeal even the worst provisions of the Affordable Care Act . This cowardice has now inspired the law \u2019 s apologists to openly mock the GOP and President Trump .\nIn fact , the man whose name is inextricably linked to the failed health-care law recently derided Trump for the failure to get repeal done during his first 100 days . CNN reported , \u201c Obama noted to an audience in midtown Manhattan that \u2018 the Affordable Care Act has never been more popular \u2014 and it \u2019 s more popular than the current president. \u2019 \u201d This , it will come as no surprise , is another of the former president \u2019 s trademark whoppers . Fox News just released a poll three days ago showing that only 16 percent of registered voters support Obamacare as is , while 57 percent of voters want it fully or partially repealed .\nThis renders the diffidence of the GOP even more inexplicable .

Second , every member of the GOP \u2014 including the timorous members of the Tuesday Group \u2014 ran in 2016 on repealing Obamacare . Thus , the real \u201c difference between being the majority and the minority \u201d is inexorably tied to their willingness to honor that pledge .
