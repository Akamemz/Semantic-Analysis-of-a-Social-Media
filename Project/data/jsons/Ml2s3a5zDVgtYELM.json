    "content": "Republicans have erased the Democratic advantage on the generic congressional ballot in a new \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll that , for the first time since April , also shows President Donald Trump \u2019 s approval rating equaling the percentage of voters who disapprove of his job performance .\nFully 39 percent of registered voters say they would support the GOP candidate for Congress in their district , while 38 percent would back the Democratic candidate . Nearly a quarter of voters , 23 percent , are undecided .\nVoters are split almost evenly along party lines . Democratic voters break for their party , 85 percent to 5 percent , while Republicans similarly favor the GOP , 84 percent to 8 percent . Among independent voters , 26 percent would vote for the Democrat , 25 percent for the Republican and nearly half , 49 percent , are undecided .\nThe GOP \u2019 s 1-point advantage comes after three months of tracking in which Democrats maintained a lead ranging between 2 and 10 points on the generic ballot . That has been generally smaller than the party \u2019 s lead in other public surveys : The most recent RealClearPolitics average shows Democrats ahead by 7 points on the generic ballot , though that \u2019 s down from a high of 13 points late last year .\nThe new year has also produced a Trump polling bump . In the new poll , 47 percent of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president , while the same percentage disapprove .\nAmong Democrats , 16 percent approve of Trump \u2019 s job performance and 80 percent disapprove . The numbers are almost exactly inverted among Republicans : 82 percent approve , while 16 percent disapprove .
