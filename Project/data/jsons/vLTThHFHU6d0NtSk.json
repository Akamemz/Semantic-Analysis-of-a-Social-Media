Jeff Flake unburdened himself and burdened the rest of us Tuesday with what may rank as one of the worst-delivered nationally televised speeches in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n\nHis message: I will not seek a second term.\n\nIt took him 17 minutes to say that. He stumbled oh-so-many times over oh-so-many of the 2,400 words he and/or his speechwriter(s) composed for him that you have to think he was unaccountably overconfident of his speechifying abilities, despite years of evidence to the contrary. He might have read the thing over a few times before attempting to utter its content.\n\nOk, he loused up the speech, but why is he not seeking a second term?\n\nPresident Trump is to blame, he said without mentioning him by name.\n\nMr. Trump has so lowered the tone and content of discourse in the world, in the U.S. and, most intolerably, in the Senate (where Mr. Trump does not have seat to sit on, as I recall) that it\u2019s now beneath Mr. flake\u2019s dignity to remain seated in the Senate seat he does have until January 2019.\n\nSeems Mr. Trump out-insulted the junior senator from Arizona, who had written and published a book devoted to insulting Mr. Trump.
