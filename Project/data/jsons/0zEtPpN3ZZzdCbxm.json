    "content": "Nine months after belittling the Islamic State as a \u201c JV \u201d terrorist group , President Obama will devote an urgent prime-time address Wednesday to his plan for defeating the suddenly resurgent militants , a strategy that will rely heavily on U.S. partnership with an untested Iraqi government and unproven Syrian rebels .\nIn a speech from the White House at 9 p.m. , Mr. Obama will tell Americans that the Islamic State is now a \u201c high national security priority , \u201d aides said . And the president will try to marshal public and international support for what would likely be a yearslong counterterrorism campaign , launched little more than a year after he declared that the large-scale fight against Islamist terrorism was all but over .\nThe president briefed House and Senate leaders of both parties at the White House on Tuesday , though it didn \u2019 t appear he laid out many specifics . An aide to GOP House Speaker John A. Boehner said the president went over some of the ideas he \u2019 s already floated , and a White House statement Tuesday that Mr. Obama believed he had the power to act without congressional approval angered many on Capitol Hill .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s address will have to reconcile his past statements with his present course of action , analysts said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to be a huge challenge for President Obama , version 2014 , to disagree with President Obama , version 2013 , who suggested that we had won the battle against terrorism , \u201d said Danielle Pletka , a foreign policy and defense analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington .\n\u201c With sufficient humility and a genuine strategy , I believe he could persuade the American people of the importance of this mission , \u201d she said . \u201c The question is : Does he have the strategy ? Does he have the humility ? That \u2019 s not entirely clear . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : World religious leaders urge unity in stopping Islamic State\nWhile White House officials underlined that Mr. Obama told the congressional leaders he already has the authority he needs to conduct the kind of operation he will lay out on Wednesday , they said he welcomed a gesture by Congress expressing support for his policy .\nA senior White House official said Mr. Obama asked the congressional leaders to authorize training and equipment for the Syrian opposition before lawmakers depart Washington for midterm election campaigning later this month . In May , Mr. Obama proposed $ 500 million in assistance .\nThat claim of authority doesn \u2019 t sit well with some in Congress , including many Democrats , who say any expansion of attacks must be put up for a vote on Capitol Hill .\n\u201c If the president intends to prolong the military campaign in Iraq or extend it into Syria , he needs to make the case directly to the American people and secure authorization from Congress , \u201d said California Rep. Adam B. Schiff , the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence .\nTennessee Sen. Bob Corker , the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , also said he thought President Obama should seek congressional \u201c buy-in \u201d on any major new mission , but said he was skeptical of the president \u2019 s intentions .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s going to ask for that , and I \u2019 m dismayed by that , \u201d Mr. Corker told CNN . \u201c I think most people here want to deal with [ the Islamic State ] in a strong manner that exterminates them . But I think not seeking that approval on the front end is extremely lacking in judgment . \u201d\nMr. Obama approved strikes last month against Islamic State militants , who have made startling gains across broad swaths of Iraq since the spring . The U.S. campaign began on Aug. 8 and totaled 153 strikes as of Tuesday afternoon , all of them in Iraq .\nThe administration \u2019 s plan for fighting the terrorists in Syria will lean on moderate Syrian rebels who are also engaged in a brutal civil war to topple the regime of President Bashar Assad . Mr. Obama hasn \u2019 t said whether he \u2019 ll expand airstrikes into Syria , and he has vowed not to send U.S. combat troops into the fight .\n\u201c Ramping up our assistance to \u2026 elements of the moderate Syrian opposition would have the effect both of taking the fight to [ the Islamic State ] but also taking the fight to the Assad regime , \u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest .\nBut vetting the various Syrian rebel groups to find reliable , moderate partners has been a slow and frustrating process for the administration . Adding to that uncertainty , the family of slain U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff said this week that the hostage was sold to the Islamic State by a supposedly moderate Syrian rebel group .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s top counterterrorism adviser , Lisa Monaco , returned from the Middle East Tuesday and told colleagues that she was encouraged by the response from governments in the region to join the fight against the Islamic State .

Arab governments such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar thus far have avoided a prominent role for fear of provoking retaliatory attacks from the Sunni militants who control major regions of both Syria and Iraq .\nThe crosscurrents of the conflict are daunting , with the regimes in Syria and Iran , which are hostile to Washington , also determined foes of the Islamic State movement , and reliable allies for the United States on the ground hard to find .\nNews reports Tuesday indicated that the leader of an ultraconservative Islamic rebel group in Syria was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing along with others of its top officials , its allies said , thereby weakening the ranks of the country \u2019 s already shaky armed opposition .\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack that killed Hassan Aboud and other leading members of Ahrar al-Sham , part of the strongest front to challenge the Islamic State .
