    "content": "Immigration is not a partisan issue , but the mainstream media and Congress have framed this current effort to fix our broken system as a partisan game , appealing to our lowest common denominators .\nBy all meaningful accounts , immigration reform needs to be addressed by Congress , and yet , our elected leaders double down on their partisan narratives , further dividing the country , giving oxygen to the extreme voices who offer no chance of solving this crisis .\nThis issue did n't start with President Trump , it 's been a decades long battle that will continue long after the current administration is gone .\nIn 1995 , President Bill Clinton received bi-partisan praise and support during in his State of the Union speech in which he announced , `` In the budget I will present to you , we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes , to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace ... We are a nation of immigrants . But we are also a nation of laws . It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years , and we must do more to stop it. \u201d ~ Bill Clinton , 1995 State Of The Union Speech\nIn 2014 , President Barack Obama made an impassioned speech from the White House declaring our immigration system is `` broken . '' He talked about a bipartisan immigration plan that was stuck in the house for a year and a half as then Speaker John Boehner refused to allow a vote be taken on the reforms . In his speech below Obama told Congress to , `` Pass A Bill ! I wan na work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution . ''\nIn the speech Obama noted , `` Even as we are a nation of immigrants , we 're also a nation of laws . Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws , I believe that they must be held accountable , especially those who may be dangerous . Let 's be honest , tracking down , rounding up and deporting millions of people is n't realistic , anyone who suggests otherwise is n't being straight with you . It 's not who we are as Americans . '' ~ Barack Obama , 2014 DACA Speech\nIn 2006 , George W. Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office . `` For decades , '' Bush started , `` the United States has not been in complete control of its borders , as a result many in our economy have been able to sneak across our border and millions have stayed . Once here illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society . Illegal immigration strains state and local budgets and brings crimes to our communities . Yet , the vast majority of illegal immigrants are decent people who work hard , support families and lead responsible lives . But we 're a nation of laws and we must enforce those laws . '' ~ George W. Bush , Immigration Reform Speech 2006\nPresident Bush had a 5-point plan that secured the border , expanded border patrol with National Guard troops , built a wall and high-tech fencing , created a temporary worker program with a path to citizenship , and held employers accountable for hiring illegal immigrants . President Bush was opposed to amnesty and catch and release . Bush said , `` The steps I 'm taking will improve our ability to catch those entering our country illegally . We must ensure that every illegal immigrant we catch is returned to their home . The process of Catch and Release is unacceptable and we will end it . In order to meet this goal we 've expanded the number of beds in our facilities , expedited the legal process to cut the deportation time , and making it clear governments must accept their citizens that have violated our immigration laws . ''\nOn June 29 , 2007 , this effort , like so many others before it , died in the Senate .",
