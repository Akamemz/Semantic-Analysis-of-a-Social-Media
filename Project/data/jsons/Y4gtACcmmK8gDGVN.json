Last time , the California senator \u2019 s well-aimed strike against the former vice president over his past opposition to busing rocked him on his heels , and gave her a big boost in the polls \u2013 though it has since slipped somewhat .\nUnderlying that tactical question , however , is an even bigger and as yet unsettled one : Is Senator Harris planting herself to Mr. Biden \u2019 s left \u2013 as her previous ambush seemed to do , implying she is more progressive than he ? Or is she laying the groundwork to try to topple him as the most viable \u201c moderate \u201d in the race ?\nIt \u2019 s a critical question , not only for Senator Harris , but for the top tier of Democratic candidates generally . Lately , many political observers have been warning that the party \u2019 s overall leftward drift could hurt them in the general election . Remember 1972 , they say , when the liberal senator from South Dakota , George McGovern , lost in a landslide to an unpopular incumbent , President Richard Nixon . Or just think back to 2016 , when Donald Trump lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in key battleground states in the Rust Belt . That could happen again .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very dangerous , \u201d says Phil Trounstine , co-editor and publisher of Calbuzz , speaking of the progressive tilt of many of the candidates . Democrats nationally are more moderate than the Twitterverse , the liberal caucus in Washington , and many of the presidential candidates , he maintains . \u201c I don \u2019 t think socialism is going to be that popular in Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , and Michigan . \u201d\nThe president is already defining his campaign as one against \u201c socialism. \u201d A top issue among the Democrats \u2019 more progressive candidates , \u201c Medicare for All , \u201d does not poll well nationally , according to a July NPR-PBS Marist poll . Only 41 % of registered voters think that a national health insurance program that replaces private health insurance is a good idea , while 54 % think it \u2019 s a bad idea . Of the leading four candidates , only Mr. Biden does not support Medicare for All .\nAll hands went up in the second June debate when candidates \u2013 including Mr. Biden and Senator Harris \u2013 were asked if they supported health coverage for unauthorized immigrants . Yet the NPR/PBS Marist poll shows only 33 % of Americans think that \u2019 s a good idea , while 62 % think it \u2019 s a bad one . Some candidates , including Senator Harris , have suggested decriminalizing illegal border crossings . That \u2019 s \u201c tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders , \u201d Jeh Johnson , former Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama , told The Washington Post .\nLast week , the senator showcased her progressive \u2013 and prosecutorial \u2013 credentials when she said that under her presidency , the Justice Department would have \u201c no choice \u201d but to pursue criminal charges against a former President Trump for obstruction of justice . She supports impeachment .\n\u201c It is not surprising that she is now articulating the more progressive policies that she has supported in recent years , \u201d says Dianne Bystrom , a longtime observer of women candidates and presidential campaigns in Iowa . Senator Harris \u2019 critique of the vice president \u2013 and its positive impact on her polling numbers \u2013 is evidence that moving to the left can create positive results for her campaign , she says in an email .\nMr. Trounstine believes that Senator Harris \u2019 primary strategy is to do \u201c well enough \u201d in Iowa and New Hampshire , try to win in South Carolina , and then attempt to use California as a slingshot to victory in other states . A post-debate July poll by Quinnipiac University saw her overtake the former vice president in her home state , though voters who identified themselves as Democrats or Democratic-leaning still said Mr. Biden would be the best leader and had the best chance of beating President Trump .\nIf the senator \u2019 s strategy works , \u201c the danger for the Democratic Party is that Kamala Harris would not have been tested in any of the industrial Midwestern states that one has to win in order to beat Trump , \u201d says Mr. Trounstine .\nRoger Salazar , a Democratic consultant in Sacramento , does not see 2020 unfolding as a 1972-like liberal trouncing . \u201c This is not the same country that McGovern and Nixon were battling it out over . This is a much different country , \u201d he says . People used to be more \u201c flexible \u201d in their positions . Now , \u201c what you see is a lot less of a battle for the middle , because the middle seems to be shrinking . \u201d\nStill , he is concerned about the battleground states of Wisconsin , Michigan , and Pennsylvania . Progressives need to do a better job of communicating to working-class voters there that they have their best interests at heart , says Mr. Salazar . They need to focus on issues of affordability and job creation .\nSenator Harris proposes giving working families a tax credit of up to $ 6,000 a year , raising teacher pay , and ensuring equal pay for women .\nOf course , it \u2019 s textbook campaign strategy to run to the left ( or right ) in primaries to appeal to base voters , and then pivot in a general election to win over a broader ideological spectrum . But can a candidate like Senator Harris pivot ? Is pivoting even possible in today \u2019 s divided America ?\nOn Monday , she seemed to be trying to lay the groundwork for such a move , unveiling a Medicare for All plan that includes a role for private insurance , as long as it meets Medicare standards and is within the Medicare system . Today , about a third of Medicare enrollees have private insurance , known as Medicare Advantage . Her plan would also extend Medicare services to include , for instance , mental health care , and it would move quickly to universal coverage by immediately signing up newborns and the uninsured . While Sen. Bernie Sanders would allow four years to transition to his Medicare for All plan , her plan would take 10 years . And it would be paid for partly by taxing stock and bond trades , rather than the middle class .\n\u201c Right now she \u2019 s looking for the center of the Democratic primary electorate , and she hasn \u2019 t quite figured out how that matches or doesn \u2019 t match with the balance that she did in California , where she was a bit center-right when she ran for Senate , \u201d says Marcia Godwin , of the University of La Verne , in La Verne , Calif .\nSome wonder if it \u2019 s already too late . \u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s room to move back to the center , \u201d given how far left many of the candidates are and the nature of the primary turnout , says pollster G. Terry Madonna of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster , Pennsylvania . Even Mr. Biden is moving further to the left , though he is in the best position to tack back to the center later on , says Mr. Madonna .\nDemocrats retook the House last year by running more moderate candidates who could win in swing districts . But Mr. Madonna points out that Democrats also won by driving up turnout among young voters , as well as with college-educated women . Those cohorts are culturally very liberal , and not opposed to having the government play a major role in many areas of the economy , he says . Add in hostility to President Trump and it explains the progressive shift .\nSince Senator Harris was elected to the Senate in 2016 , she has built a strong , progressive voting record \u2013 if a short one . Progressive Punch ranks her as the third most liberal member of the Senate for her \u201c lifetime \u201d voting record , just below Elizabeth Warren . With many more years under his belt , Sen. Bernie Sanders ranks seventh .\nBut some question how firm her beliefs are . Over the course of her prosecutorial career in California , for instance , she changed positions on the death penalty , opposing it as the San Francisco district attorney when a police officer was killed , then defending it as state attorney general . Last week she lambasted the Trump administration for resuming federal capital punishment as \u201c misguided and immoral \u201d and called for a national moratorium . And she has stepped back from her controversial policy to punish parents for their children \u2019 s truancy , which resulted in a few parents going to jail .\n\u201c Her own record is ambiguous , \u201d says Mr. Trounstine . \u201c She can make it sound left , she can make it sound moderate , depending on what she has to be emphasizing at any given moment . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThat ideological flexibility can be useful , but it can also open her up to attacks from other candidates , and it could prompt voters to question her authenticity .\nIn the end , political observers still expect a desire to defeat the president will override all else for Democrats . And that may be the biggest risk for progressive candidates , says Mr. Madonna . \u201c You can \u2019 t rule out that [ President Trump ] can \u2019 t win the electoral college again . So for the Democrats , they \u2019 re in a sense trapped in their own agenda. \u201d They don \u2019 t want to hinder the enthusiasm of their base voters , but that may not play well enough in the Rust Belt .",
