    "content": "The Democrats have spent well over two years asking themselves what they did wrong in the last presidential election and how to avoid those mistakes in 2020 . But they seem to suffer from a collective learning disability that prevents them from absorbing the obvious : Their party will lose again if they continue to insult the voters by insisting that the president they elected isn \u2019 t worthy of the office and that their country was founded on oppression and remains rife with racism , cruelty , and injustice . Yet this false and dispiriting vision seems once again to have become the Democratic Party line .\nThe lesson the Democrats seem to have learned from 2016 isn \u2019 t that they failed to earn the people \u2019 s votes , but rather that the electorate didn \u2019 t deserve the benign leadership offered by their standard-bearer , Hillary Clinton . Or , as she herself put it , \u201c I won the places that are optimistic , diverse , dynamic , moving forward . And his whole campaign , \u2018 Make America Great Again , \u2019 was looking backwards. \u201d One would think that , after two years of such self-flattering rationalization , the Democrats would wake up to reality and stop denigrating the people whose votes they must have to win elections .\nInstead , they have managed to convince themselves that they lost in 2016 because President Trump and his supporters are bigots . They stand on the floor of the House and refer to the president \u2019 s supporters as \u201c just plain dumb. \u201d Democratic representatives appear on talking-head shows and call Trump himself a racist . Democratic presidential candidates accuse him of \u201c using race like a weapon to divide our country against itself. \u201d They even stand in the pulpits of churches and denounce Trump and his supporters . Here is part of a January sermon delivered by Rep. Hank Johnson ( D-Ga. ) :\nTyranny in the form of slavery has been the reality in this country before and we must be diligent to ensure it does not happen again.\u2026 Americans elected an authoritarian , an anti-immigrant , racist strongman to the nation \u2019 s highest office .
