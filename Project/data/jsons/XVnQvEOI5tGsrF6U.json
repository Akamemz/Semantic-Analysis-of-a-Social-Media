It was a long 2017 .\nWhat we miss in those stories is what doesn \u2019 t happen . But what doesn \u2019 t happen matters too . Time , energy , and money are limited . Opportunity costs are real , and that \u2019 s particularly true in a White House as unfocused , understaffed , and ill-managed as this one .\nAnd so , in my 2017 retrospective , I want to explore some of the things the Trump administration didn \u2019 t do , and the price we may pay for it .\nIn 2016 , the most recent year for which we have data , a record 63,000 Americans died from drug overdoses \u2014 and two-thirds ( and possibly more ) of those deaths were opioid-related . To put that in perspective , that \u2019 s more Americans than died from HIV/AIDS in the worst year of the epidemic , more Americans than die annually from motor accidents or gun violence . If current trends continue , opioids could kill 650,000 over the next decade .\nThis is a crisis that needs not just money but also focus , leadership , and creativity . Progress is possible \u2014 Vermont \u2019 s success has proven that . The federal government could be scaling up Vermont \u2019 s program ; it could be throwing its vast scientific and public health resources into research and support ; it could be spending real money on a race-to-the-top program to fund , study , and expand promising state and local responses ; it could be working to change our cultural understanding of addiction , our counterproductive tendency to treat it as a moral failure .\nInstead , capital \u2014 both financial and political \u2014 that could have gone toward solving the opioid epidemic was plowed into undermining the Affordable Care Act and funneling trillions in tax cuts to corporations . Trump eventually declared a state of emergency over the opioid crisis , but didn \u2019 t even ask for new funding to fight it .
