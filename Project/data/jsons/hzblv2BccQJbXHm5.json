    "content": "On the twenty-seventh day of the coronavirus lockdown in Chengdu , in southwestern China , five masked men appeared in the lobby of my apartment building in order to deliver a hundred-inch TCL Xclusive television . It was late morning , and I was taking my nine-year-old twin daughters , Ariel and Natasha , outside to get some air . The three of us also were wearing surgical masks , and we stopped to watch the deliverymen . I had never seen such an enormous TV ; it arrived in an eight-foot-long box that weighed more than three hundred pounds . Two of the deliverymen stood inside an elevator with a tape measure , trying to figure out whether the box would fit . Otherwise , it was going to be a long haul up the stairs to the twenty-eighth floor .\nBy that point , the country was deep into the most ambitious quarantine in history , with at least seven hundred and sixty million people confined largely to their homes . The legal groundwork had been established on January 20th , when the National Health Commission designated the highest level of treatment and control to fight the new coronavirus , which eventually became known as COVID-19 . After that , provinces and municipalities issued their own regulations , and the Chengdu government passed its first measures on January 24th . They were tightened seven days later , when it became clear that the epidemic had reached a point of crisis : during that week , the number of reported deaths in China had increased more than sixfold . By the end of January , there were a total of 11,791 confirmed cases , with two hundred and fifty-nine deaths .\nMy family rents an apartment in a nine-building complex not far from the center of Chengdu , where I teach writing at a local university . We chose the place , last September , primarily for its location : the apartment blocks are situated beside a pleasant , tree-lined stretch of the Fu River , and there \u2019 s a subway stop outside one of the side gates . But , after the quarantine began , the subway was deserted and both side entrances were chained shut . Anybody who arrived at the main gate was greeted by an infrared temperature gun to the forehead . The gun was wielded by a government-assigned volunteer in a white hazmat suit , and , behind him , a turnstile led to a thick plastic mat soaked with a bleach solution . A sign read \u201c Shoe Sole Disinfecting Area , \u201d and there was always a trail of wet prints leading away from the mat , like a footbath at a public swimming pool .\nCompared with other places , our compound \u2019 s restrictions were relatively light . We could leave and return as often as we pleased , provided that we carried passes that had been issued by the neighborhood committee , the most local level of the Communist Party . The majority of my friends in other parts of China were restricted to one individual per household going out every two days , and often that person had to tell the authorities where she was headed . Even at our complex , which has few foreign residents , it was rare for people to go outside . All restaurants , government offices , and most shops had been closed , and , after the Lunar New Year holiday ended , in February , all schools would be suspended indefinitely .

In my lobby , the most packages I counted at any time was a hundred and twenty-five , all of them marked with apartment numbers in black ink . Sometimes it was possible to see what was inside . On the morning that the Xclusive TV was delivered , the contents of other packages reinforced the impression that people had settled in for the long haul : two electric power strips for Apartment 1101 , three bottles of Omo laundry detergent for 3003 , a huge box of fresh ginger for 3704 .\nI tried to strike up a conversation with one of the TV deliverymen .
