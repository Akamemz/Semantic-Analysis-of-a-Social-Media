Diversify your media diet\n\nPew also found in its 2014 study that certain media habits correlated with political identity and polarization. Consistent liberals consumed news from a variety of sources they expressed general trust in, while 47 percent of conservatives reported relying on Fox News alone for their political news. The study also found that liberals were more likely to block or \u201cunfriend\u201d people they disagreed with on social media, while conservatives were more likely to have friends who shared their opinions.\n\nThat\u2019s problematic because a core tenet of democracy is to work through differences by challenging opposing opinions and ideas.\n\nDiversifying the kind of news and information someone consumes helps in understanding the other side\u2019s point of view. Listening only to passionate pundits furthering conspiracy theories rather than facts can also lead to an \u201cus vs. them\u201d attitude \u2014 something MIT Technology Review called an \"insidious problem.\"\n\nFor liberals and conservatives alike, being well-informed means seeking out and reading respectable publications from both sides of the political spectrum, according to the Review, because it leaves more opportunity for people to connect even when they disagree.\n\n\"Connecting people is important when they share similar interests but arguably even more so when their views clash,\" the review stated.\n\n2. Don\u2019t rely solely on social media or search engines\n\nGetting personalized recommendations online may be convenient, but it\u2019s not ideal when it comes to news and media. The key to being informed is understanding an issue well from multiple viewpoints. That\u2019s where relying just on social media and online algorithms for news can become a problem, Obama administration social media adviser Caleb Gardner told students at Northwestern University this fall.\n\nGardner argued that because social media isn't dedicated to balancing news feeds with varying points of view and instead tailors news to users based on what they like, it's dangerous if it's the only source of news. The most obvious reason is that the news items found on social media are often fake, which can confuse users about what the facts actually are.\n\n\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t frigten you, you don\u2019t know enough about Facebook\u2019s algorithm. If you have a parent who\u2019s a Trump supporter, they are seeing a completely different set of news items than you are,\u201d he said\n\nThat has many leaders, including European authorities, worried about the future of political debate. \u201cThis is a development that we need to pay careful attention to,\u201d German chancellor Angela Merkel told an international media conference in Munich this fall. \u201cThe big internet platforms, through their algorithms, have become an eye of a needle which diverse media must pass through [to access their users].\u201d\n\nSocial media is particularly fraught because of the complexity of news feeds. Even if users are friends of people of differing opinions, that\u2019s no guarantee of being exposed to opposing view points, as what appears in a user\u2019s news feed is determined by engagement. So if users haven\u2019t \u201cliked\u201d or commented on something in awhile on someone\u2019s profile, that person will eventually disappear from their news feed.\n\nAnd while 44 percent of Americans get their news via Facebook, the news items found there are often fabricated and incentivized to go viral, something Facebook has come under serious scrutiny for in recent months.\n\n3. Humanize your conversations\n\nQuartz magazine recently spoke to Dian Killian, a collaborative communications consultant, about scientifically proven methods to help people converse effectively across ideological divides.\n\nCalled the \u201cRosenberg method\u201d after the civil rights-era psychologist who invented it, the main goal is to make sure both parties feel that they\u2019ve been heard and respected, even if the two sides disagree vehemently.\n\nThe key ingredient is empathy \u2014 seeing the person with a different opinion as a person first, rather than a problem to be corrected.\n\nUsing emotional phrases in conversations or in online exchanges such as, \u201cI hear you \u2026\u201d or \u201cI feel like \u2026\u201d or asking, \u201cWhy do you feel this way?\u201d helps people to feel they\u2019re having a conversation rather than an argument. Killian told Quartz that leaves people with a positive exchange that makes it hard to demonize people of different viewpoints.\n\nAs she put it, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect someone who\u2019s been injured to hear my side until they felt that I had fully understood the depth of their pain.\u201d\n\n4. Take the conversation offline\n\nLimiting political conversations and interactions to social media gives users more chances to see people out of their true context.\n\nFor those more focused on eliminating polarization in their own lives, some nonprofit groups like Village Square and Living Room Conversations are specifically dedicated to bringing people of different viewpoints together in real life to reach a deeper understanding of one another.\n\nYou never know who you\u2019ll meet, and you might just find you have more in common than you thought with someone of a different political or ideological persuasion.",
