    "content": "An Obama administration health official said Sunday that U.S. protocols on Ebola failed because they originally were intended for African field hospitals , while the White House came under another round of attacks for its refusal to restrict travel from nations suffering epidemic outbreaks .\nDr. Anthony Fauci , head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instructions for dealing with the virus were taken from the World Health Organization \u2019 s protocol for Africa , where conditions are much different from those in U.S. hospitals .\nTwo nurses caring for an Ebola patient flown into the U.S. from Africa have contracted the virus as a result of those flawed rules , and dozens more people are under observation or could be threatened by contact with those nurses .\n\u201c The answer is that the protocol that was originally recommended was a protocol that \u2019 s a WHO protocol that \u2019 s best fitted for out in the field . It doesn \u2019 t cover every single aspect of your skin , \u201d Dr. Fauci said on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\n\u201c That worked in the field , \u201d Dr. Fauci said . \u201c What \u2019 s very clear now , if you \u2019 re in an intensive care setting , doing things you would never do in the bush or in the field in Africa , very invasive-type procedures , that that is not the optimal way . \u201d\nOfficials at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital took out full-page ads in two newspapers Sunday to apologize for \u201c mistakes \u201d in their treatment of Ebola patient Thomas Duncan of Liberia , who died Oct. 8 after flying to Dallas to visit family .\nDr. Fauci said the CDC will issue new guidelines soon to state explicitly that no part of the skin should be exposed to the air .\n\u201c Very clearly , when you go into a hospital , have to intubate somebody , have all of the body fluids , you \u2019 ve got to be completely covered . So that \u2019 s going to be one of the things to be complete covering with no skin showing whatsoever , \u201d he said Sunday .\nThe American Nurses Association and other groups have called for clearer guidelines , though the association \u2019 s president lamented the delay in issuing them \u2014 they were expected this weekend .\n\u201c We \u2019 re disappointed that the recommendations are still not available , \u201d Pamela Cipriano said . \u201c Having a lag in official direction from the CDC doesn \u2019 t instill the greatest confidence in their ability to rapidly respond . \u201d\nThe exact means through which Dallas nurses Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson caught the disease remains unknown .\nRepublican lawmakers said Sunday that those missteps could have been prevented with a temporary travel ban on those with visas from Ebola hot zones such as Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .\n\u201c The first mistake that was made was allowing Thomas Duncan to get on an airplane and fly to the United States , \u201d Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union. \u201d \u201c If he hadn \u2019 t flown to the United States , none of the other mistakes would have happened . \u201d\nMore than two dozen countries in Africa , the Caribbean and elsewhere have instituted Ebola-related travel bans , but public health officials continued to insist Sunday that entry restrictions would do little to prevent an outbreak on U.S. soil .\nDr. Fauci , who made the rounds on the Sunday talk shows , said a travel ban would have downsides .\n\u201c The strongest argument against it is that when people are coming into the country , you know exactly , you can track them , \u201d Dr. Fauci said . \u201c If you say , \u2018 Nobody comes in from Sierra Leone , Liberia or Guinea , \u2019 there are so many other ways to get into the country . You can go to one of the other countries and then get back in . So when they come in from a place where you know you can track them , you know . \u201d\nRep. Tim Murphy , the Pennsylvania Republican who helped lead an oversight hearing Thursday on the Ebola outbreak , argued that a travel restriction was needed to \u201c protect and defend the people of the United States . \u201d\n\u201c The president has sealed off Israel in the past . We \u2019 ve sealed off other areas temporarily . We can have travel restrictions until we get the rest right , and the rest is not right , \u201d Mr. Murphy said on \u201c Fox News Sunday. \u201d \u201c Assumptions that they have \u2014 for example , that it will lead to the collapse of the economy in Africa \u2014 I don \u2019 t agree with . \u201d\nThe International SOS website reports that 28 countries have implemented entry restrictions on those with visas from Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , and in some cases Nigeria .\nMost of the travel bans are within Africa , and they include land neighbors of the three most afflicted countries . Other countries with restrictions include several Caribbean nations , including Jamaica , as well as Belize and Guyana .\nThe Ivory Coast has closed its land borders , but recently lifted its prohibition on passenger flights from Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , according to International SOS .\nMr. Cruz argued that the current method of checking the temperatures of passengers from affected nations works only if those individuals are exhibiting symptoms .

Duncan would have traveled right through the screenings , \u201d Mr. Cruz said . \u201c The screenings wouldn \u2019 t have stopped him because he wasn \u2019 t presenting symptoms at that time . \u201d\nDr. Fauci noted that Sunday marks the end of the 21-day incubation period for Ebola since Duncan arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital , meaning that the people who first cared for him there now either have become sick with Ebola or will not get the disease .\n\u201c The ones now today that are going to be \u2018 off the hook \u2019 are the ones that saw him initially in the emergency room , \u201d he said .

The ability of the U.S. military to move goods and supplies is pretty massive . We all want to stop Ebola in Africa , but we also don \u2019 t want it to come here . \u201d\nMr. Obama said Saturday that a travel ban \u201c could actually make the situation worse , \u201d but Democrats are increasingly joining Republicans in calling for a temporary halt to commercial travel from the region .
