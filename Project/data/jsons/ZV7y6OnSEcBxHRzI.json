    "content": "While Democrats want the press and voters to concentrate on President Trump \u2019 s phone call with Ukraine , \u201c the problem for Democrats is that a review of Hunter Biden \u2019 s career shows clearly that he , along with Joe Biden \u2019 s brother James , has been trading on their family name for decades , cashing in on the implication \u2014 and sometimes the explicit argument \u2014 that giving money to a member of Joe Biden \u2019 s family wins the favor of Joe Biden , \u201d argues Ryan Grim at The Intercept . Trump \u2019 s behavior may be shameless , Grim says , but that doesn \u2019 t mean Biden \u2019 s history isn \u2019 t an issue , he writes in this excerpt :\nIn trading on his father \u2019 s name and power to advance his career , Hunter Biden is following in the footsteps of James Biden , Joe \u2019 s younger brother .\nIt began small . In 1973 , one year after Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at age 29 , James Biden opened the nightclub Seasons Change with what Politico , referencing contemporaneous local reporting in Delaware , called \u201c unusually generous bank loans . \u201d\nWhen James ran into trouble , Joe , as a senator , later complained that the bank shouldn \u2019 t have loaned James the money . \u201c What I \u2019 d like to know , \u201d Biden told the News Journal in 1977 , \u201c is how the guy in charge of loans let it get this far. \u201d The paper investigated , and sources at the bank said that the loan was made because James was Joe \u2019 s brother .\nJames , in the \u2019 90s , founded Lion Hall Group , which lobbied for Mississippi trial lawyers involved in tobacco litigation . According to Curtis Wilkie \u2019 s book \u201c The Fall of the House of Zeus , \u201d the trial lawyers wanted James Biden \u2019 s help pushing Joe Biden on tobacco legislation .\nThat same decade , in 1996 , Hunter Biden got in the game . Fresh out of law school , with thousands of options before him , he chose to go work for MBNA , then a dominant issuer of credit cards , while also serving as Biden \u2019 s deputy campaign manager .\nMBNA was one of the most powerful corporations in Delaware , a state with no shortage of major companies thanks to its lax tax and regulatory approach , and has since been absorbed by Bank of America . Biden in the 1990s was known half-jokingly as the senator from MBNA , though he didn \u2019 t find it funny . \u201c I \u2019 m not the senator from MBNA , \u201d he said in 1999 .\nHe was , however , MBNA \u2019 s greatest champion in the Senate . Throughout the 1990s , bankruptcies were on the rise , and MBNA began pushing hard to reform the law to make it harder for people to discharge debt . The controversy brought Elizabeth Warren into politics ; a well-known bankruptcy law professor , she was appointed to a commission to review the law , which began her decades-long clash with Biden .\nIn 2001 , Hunter Biden transitioned full-time to a federal lobbyist , though he stayed on the payroll of MBNA as a consultant until 2005 , when President George W. Bush signed Biden \u2019 s Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act into law .\nIt was a savage piece of legislation , and Joe Biden even worked to block an amendment that would have offered bankruptcy protection to people with medical debt . The bill also blocked people from discharging private student loan debt under bankruptcy . Total student loan debt was under $ 400 billion in 2005 ; it surged in the wake of the law \u2019 s passage and is now over $ 1.5 trillion .\nHunter Biden \u2019 s transparent cashing-in on his name was becoming a political liability for his father , so Joe Biden pushed him to find non-lobbying work , Anthony Lotito , a New York financial adviser , said in a complaint he filed in a New York state court . ( James and Hunter , in a separate filing , denied that Joe Biden had made the call to Lotito . )\nThat Joe Biden saw Hunter \u2019 s work as politically damaging enough to him in 2005 demonstrates that he was entirely aware of the appearance it gave of corruption . His solution was to help Hunter and James into their positions at a financial firm , Paradigm Global Advisors .\nsee also Joe Biden is as cool as you think he is It was a family affair at the launch of Ashley ...\nIn 2007 , James Biden teamed up again with some of the tobacco lawyers from the previous decade , planning to launch a lobbying firm that Hunter would also be involved in .\nAgain , the affair became a political problem for Biden , thanks to a sordid moment in which James Biden \u2019 s two prospective partners were caught on an FBI wiretap saying , \u201c We really need to push on the Senate bill , \u201d and \u201c We \u2019 re going to meet with the Bidens around noon , \u201d apparently in reference to legislation to compensate black farmers for discrimination . The firm never came to fruition because one of the Bidens \u2019 potential partners was arrested .\nThat year , Biden launched his second failed presidential bid , but he wound up on the ticket with Barack Obama , serving the next eight years as vice president .\nHunter \u2019 s relationship with MBNA became a political problem again . A 2008 New York Times story , headlined , \u201c Obama Aides Defend Bank \u2019 s Pay to Biden Son , \u201d reads like deja vu : \u201c Obama aides said he had never lobbied for MBNA and that there was nothing improper about the payments , \u201d which were reported to be $ 100,000 per year .\nNews that the University of Delaware had paid Biden \u2019 s firm millions , and gotten many millions more in earmarks , also caused the vice presidential nominee trouble .\nIn the meantime , Paradigm Global Advisors fared poorly and shut down in 2010 . James quickly found new work , joining a construction firm in November 2010 . In June 2011 , while Joe Biden was overseeing Iraq policy , the firm won a $ 1.5 billion contract building homes in Iraq .\nThe company \u2019 s founder , Irvin Richter , told Fox Business Network that having James on board helped .\n\u201c Listen , his name helps him get in the door , but it doesn \u2019 t help him get business , \u201d he said . \u201c People who have important names tend to get in the door easier but it doesn \u2019 t mean success . If he had the name Obama , he would get in the door easier . \u201d\nHunter , meanwhile , went into business with the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry , Chris Heinz , forming the firm Rosemont Seneca , along with partners Devon Archer and Eric Schwerin .\nIn 2012 , Archer and Hunter Biden connected with Jonathan Li , who ran a Chinese private equity fund , Bohai Capital , and began talks about working together . They did a large real estate deal together in 2013 and began setting up a joint fund . In late 2013 , Hunter Biden traveled with his father on official business to China , where he introduced the vice president to his partner , Li .\nThe new firm , Bohai Harvest RST , as The Intercept reported earlier this year , would go on to invest in facial-recognition technology used to surveil China \u2019 s Muslim population as part of its ongoing cultural genocide operation . The firm , according to the Wall Street Journal , planned to raise $ 1.5 billion in capital .\nTrump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani have since contorted that reality into the notion that China simply handed Hunter Biden $ 1.5 billion . \u201c I wonder where the hell that money is , man , because I \u2019 ve got to pay tuitions , \u201d Biden has since responded . \u201c God bless me ! \u201d\nAnd then there \u2019 s Ukraine .
