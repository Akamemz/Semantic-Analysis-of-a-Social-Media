His schizophrenic jaunt from Mexico to Arizona\u2014I love the Mexican people ! I love them so much I \u2019 m creating a police force to send them home to Mexico ! \u2014was a mess .\nThat great Mother Jones expose on how foreign-born girls working for the Trump modeling agency worked in the United States illegally\u2014for a man who wants to throw the illegals out\u2014was jaw-dropping . It would have finished him off , in a rational world .\nAnd yet he \u2019 s closer than he \u2019 s been for months . Why ?\nBecause Hillary Clinton is more unpopular than she \u2019 s been in a long time\u2014or ever , if you believe the spin on the the new Washington Post/ABC poll . In that one , she \u2019 s 15 points underwater . Other recent polls have been both better and worse\u2014she \u2019 s minus-17 in YouGov/Economist but only minus-8 in Fox . But the picture is pretty consistent overall , and it \u2019 s bleak .\nHer unfavorable numbers over the course of the last several months tell an interesting and mostly overlooked tale . The conventional wisdom is that her numbers went south after the Times broke the story in March 2015 of the email server , and they \u2019 ve been lower-hemispheric ever since . That \u2019 s true\u2014but there are variations within that are worth examining .\nThrough the summer of 2015 , she was barely underwater\u2014three to five points . By December and January it was marginally worse , six or seven in most polls . But she didn \u2019 t hit double digits until March and April , and then she really bottomed out around minus-20 in late May and early June .\nWhat was happening ? Well , she and Bernie Sanders were going at it pretty good , which surely reduced some liberals \u2019 opinions of her . But mostly she was getting buffeted about on the winds of scandal\u2014the Benghazi committee was leaking a steady trail of morsels , and in late May the State Department inspector general came out with its report saying she hadn \u2019 t gotten White House approval for using the private server .\nIn other words , there looks to be a link between fresh Clinton scandal stories in the newspapers and her approval numbers dropping from a still-lamentable-but-manageable minus-8 or 10 to a ( gulp ! ) minus-15 or 17 . And in the last two weeks , of course , as we \u2019 ve seen a new batch of such articles , her negatives have inched back up , and the head-to-head polls have tightened .\nWhat does this tell you to look forward to ?
