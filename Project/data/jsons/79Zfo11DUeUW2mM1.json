What we knew is that The Washington Post reported that President Trump actually tried to get Dan Coats to pressure the F.B.I . to shut down its investigation . But we didn \u2019 t know anything that suggested there was something going on behind the scenes when the special counsel showed up to interview these three senior intelligence officials . So it really makes me wonder : Does Bob Mueller know something ? Does he have some indication that something went on behind the scenes ? Or is this just kind of an open-ended question ? It seems far more likely that Bob Mueller thinks there \u2019 s a reason for lifting up this rock . This question is toward the bottom of the list , but it gets at the heart of Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation . His mandate is to look at Russian election interference and whether the Trump campaign was complicit . We \u2019 ve already seen evidence that a Trump campaign adviser was told that the Russians had compromising emails about Hillary Clinton . This question gets at whether the candidate himself knew . President Trump has said repeatedly to the public that there is no collusion . \u201c There \u2019 s been no collusion. \u201d \u201c No collusion. \u201d \u201c No collusion whatsoever with Russia. \u201d Will he say the same thing when he \u2019 s asked by federal investigators ? We \u2019 ll see . Well , if you remember , President Trump met with the Russian ambassador to the United States , Sergey Kislyak , inside the White House . And during their meeting he told the Russian ambassador , quote : I think this question stands out to me because it really goes to the heart of this case . Did President Trump try to end the Russia investigation into whether any of his associates colluded with that country by firing James Comey . This question cuts at one of the most sacred powers the president has : the ability to pardon someone . But in this case , was the president using that power as a way of stopping his former national security adviser from cooperating with Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation ?",
