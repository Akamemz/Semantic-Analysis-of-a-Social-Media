One of those emails has generated a lot of interest in conservative circles because \u2014 conservatives say \u2014 it shows that polls are being systematically biased in Clinton 's favor . In the email , Thomas Matzzie , an operative for the 2008 Clinton primary campaign , asked advisers at a progressive group called the Atlas Project to `` recommend oversamples for our polling . '' Bloggers like Zero Hedge and Gateway Pundit pounced on this as evidence that the Clinton campaign was working with mainstream media organizations to rig public polls in Clinton 's favor . That would be a big story if it were true . But as I 'll explain below , it 's not \u2014 people were misinterpreting a banal discussion about the campaign 's internal polling .

Social media sites like Facebook have democratized the media landscape , allowing anyone to create and distribute content to their friends and family . There are a lot of good things about this , but it 's also proving to have a serious downside : Without the quality filters traditionally supplied by mainstream media outlets , there 's a lot more room for total nonsense to circulate widely .

In that case , you 've probably never heard of oversampling , you do n't know that campaigns run internal polls , and you might not notice that the email was from 2008 rather than 2016 . And so if someone shares a Facebook post arguing that the email shows the Clinton campaign is rigging public polls \u2014 and that this explains why Trump is behind in the polls even though most of your friends support Trump \u2014 you 're going to be inclined to believe it . And you might even share it with your friends . So this conspiracy theory has rocketed around the conservative internet , passing from one conservative Facebook user to another .

But it 's a problem that social media is now making much worse . The Washington Post and other mainstream media organizations have written stories explaining why the `` oversampling '' conspiracy theory is wrong . But because these stories challenge conservatives ' biases instead of confirming them , they 're much less likely to get traction among conservatives on social media .
