'' It called for the players involved to be disciplined and for both the league and team to issue a `` very public apology . ''\nThe so-called `` hands up , do n't shoot '' gesture has been commonly used by demonstrators protesting the decision of a St. Louis County grand jury to not indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in suburban Ferguson . Some witnesses said Brown , who was black , had his hands up before being fatally shot by Wilson , who is white .\nPrior to kickoff of their game against the Oakland Raiders , Rams wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together and raised their hands , but the move was obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the Edward Jones Dome . Jared Cook , Stedman Bailey and Chris Givens then came out and stood together with hands raised in the fog .\n`` I just think there has to be a change , '' Cook said after the Rams ' 52-0 win . `` There has to be a change that starts with the people that are most influential around the world .\n`` No matter what happened on that day , no matter how the whole situation went down , there has to be a change . ''\nCoach Jeff Fisher said he 'd not been aware the gesture had been planned by the players , all of them black .\nCook said players have been too busy to go to Ferguson , plus `` it 's kind of dangerous down there and none of us want to get caught up in anything . ''\n`` It takes some guts , it takes some heart , so I admire the people around the world that have been doing it , '' he added .\nSLPOA Business Manager Jeff Roorda was quoted in a statement released by the organization as saying `` All week long , the Rams and the NFL were on the phone with the St. Louis Police Department asking for assurances that the players and the fans would be kept safe from the violent protesters who had rioted , looted , and burned buildings in Ferguson ... then , as the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis 's finest , they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer , that is way out-of-bounds , to put it in football parlance . ''\nAcross the street from the stadium , about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a distance . Protesters chanted `` Hands up , do n't shoot !
