This happens because people will go to great lengths to qualify their worldviews , regardless of whether or not it \u2019 s true .

One of them , for example , involved showing 174 participants who either opposed or supported same-sex marriage supposed facts that either bolstered or refuted their opinions . When they were shown facts that opposed their views , regardless of their stance , they were more likely to say it wasn \u2019 t about the facts but rather about their own moral opinions .

In one of the experiments , some participants were told President Obama \u2019 s policy performance could be empirically testable while others weren \u2019 t told anything ; they were then asked to rate his performance in five areas , such as job creation . When the researchers compared supporters and opponents responses , they found that , among those who were told his performance was testable , the amount of people who fell on either extreme dropped by 40 percent .\nThe fourth experiment also showed how people will bolster their beliefs especially when they don \u2019 t have a factual basis to rely on .
