Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that .

Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\n\u201c American pundits with [ only a ] cursory understanding of British politics are making simplistic comparisons , suggesting that Corbyn \u2019 s landslide loss dooms Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders . The reality is that we don \u2019 t know if it means anything at all . What we can say is that Corbyn \u2019 s train-wreck candidacy confirms that it \u2019 s not a good idea to nominate someone who is liked by only 23 percent of voters ( who knew ? ) and that there are electoral risks to far-left candidates . ( It \u2019 s worth noting that Corbyn is much further left than Warren or Sanders . ) \u201d Brian Klaas , Washington Post\nSome , however , contend that Johnson \u201c is quietly forging a new conservatism \u2014 appealing to the working poor and aspiring middle classes , tough on immigration and crime , but much more generous in spending on hospitals and schools and science\u2026 \u201c [ Johnson ] has done what no other conservative leader in the West has done : He has co-opted and thereby neutered the far right . The reactionary Brexit Party has all but collapsed since Boris took over . Anti-immigration fervor has calmed . The Tories have also moved back to the economic and social center\u2026 [ They ] now favor tax cuts for the poor , have a strong program for climate change , and have proposed an Australian-style immigration policy to defuse native panic\u2026 the Johnson strategy is one every other major democracy should examine. \u201d Andrew Sullivan , New York Magazine\n\u201c This election could also signal the end of the United Kingdom as a political entity .

The Scottish National Party \u2019 s leader , Nicola Sturgeon , will redouble her efforts to hold a new referendum on independence . Northern Irish nationalists , too , earned significant victories , while unionists continue to denounce Johnson \u2019 s Brexit deal , which erects a customs wall with Great Britain\u2026 Brexit was never a project of the whole country , and only England and Wales endorsed it . Its dependence on nostalgia , anti-immigrant sentiment and the language of global buccaneering and domestic control profoundly alienates other parts of the U.K. \u201d Jonathan Lis , Washington Post\n\u201c The voters who gave Mr. Johnson the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher share few of the free-trade or deregulatory instincts of the Brexiteers who masterminded Mr. Johnson \u2019 s campaign or filled his last cabinet . These voters want safe jobs , protection from imports and the restoration of a Britain that vanished in the contrails of the global economy . That is worlds away from the agile , economically open , lightly regulated Britain that Mr. Johnson \u2019 s Downing Street brain trust envisions \u2014 Singapore-on-Thames , to use their preferred marketing slogan .

That 's a quick turnaround , especially if he seeks to diverge significantly from EU rules , as he has indicated\u2026 \u201c And the second phase of Brexit negotiations is set to be more trying than the last . For months we have watched Westminster for make or break votes , but the ratification process will turn our collective attention to parliaments all across the European Union -- every member state will get a vote and veto on the framework of the UK 's future relationship. \u201d Eliza Mackintosh , CNN\n\u201c Every year since the referendum , the average company in Ireland \u2014 which trades heavily with Britain \u2014 has seen its growth in investment reduced by 4.2 percent , and hiring is 15 percent less than it otherwise would have been because of uncertainty , [ a new paper ] concludes . Yet even across the Atlantic , the average American company has seen investment growth limited by 0.5 percent a year and hiring slowed by 1.7 percent\u2026 If Brexit uncertainty has been damaging , what replaces it is the near certainty of weaker economic growth and diminished living standards . \u201d Peter S.
