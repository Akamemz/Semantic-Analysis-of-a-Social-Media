Obama would also pick up four potentially crucial electoral votes .\n`` We have held hundreds of events targeting women voters , '' said Harrell Kirstein , a spokesman for the Obama campaign in New Hampshire .\nThese have ranged from `` Women 's Wednesdays '' mixers to visits by fair pay advocate Lilly Ledbetter and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . On Wednesday , Cecile Richards , president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund , visited New Hampshire to kick off a multitown phone-banking effort .\nRepublican Mitt Romney also has made New Hampshire a focus of his campaign , both in ad spending and on-the-ground appearances . He has an event scheduled on Oct. 30 in Manchester , just a week before the election , and his campaign is focusing on a get-out-the-vote effort .\nRomney also has used New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte as a prolific surrogate for Romney in the state . Ayotte , who at one point was discussed as a potential running mate for Romney , helped the GOP do well with women locally in 2010 , when she was easily elected to the Senate .\n`` This is an important state . It 's an important state in large part because of the state Legislature , '' Richards said .\nIt 's no coincidence Richards makes that argument .
