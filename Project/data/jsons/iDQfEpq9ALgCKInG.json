    "content": "Now what ? The Supreme Court vacancy created by Antonin Scalia \u2019 s death blows everything wide open . It gives\u2014in theory\u2014President Obama a chance to put a third justice on the court , but much more than that , it would be a third appointment that would change the ideological balance of the court . The question many are asking , then , is : What sort of nominee could Obama put forward whom the Republican Senate might approve ?\nBut it \u2019 s the wrong question . Or , it \u2019 s a fair question , but it \u2019 s a question with a depressing answer , because the answer is probably : no sort whatsoever .\nThat is to say , it \u2019 s nearly impossible to imagine this Senate\u2014and this majority leader , the intensely political Mitch McConnell\u2014letting Obama tilt the balance of the court in his last year , an election year . And sure enough , McConnell put out a statement Saturday evening before Scalia \u2019 s body was even cold . \u201c The American people\u200e should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice . Therefore , this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president , \u201d he said in a statement .\nAnd that would seem to be that . Alas , according to legal scholars I consulted Saturday evening , there is no constitutional imperative requiring the Senate to act according to any timetable . So McConnell can do what he wants . He controls the calendar .\nBut there are two things he doesn \u2019 t control . He doesn \u2019 t control public opinion . And he doesn \u2019 t control the chess moves Obama can make on the other side of the board . It could prove to be a bad public relations error for McConnell to have made this Shermanesque statement at this early juncture . Obama will come out and say : Hey , wait a minute here . I am the president . I was elected to a four-year term , not a three-year term . We have a Constitution . It dictates a process . I plan to follow that process .\nAnd presumably , he will . With who ? We \u2019 ll get to that . But first , here \u2019 s another key procedural point to bear in mind . Any Supreme Court nominee needs 60 votes to clear cloture , not just 51 . The deal the parties struck on the use of the filibuster a couple of years ago specifically excluded Supreme Court justices , so any nominee will need 60 votes . And that seems like Mission Impossible times 10 .\nThen the political question becomes , with 46 Democrats ( including independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King ) , is there any remote way to get 14 Republicans to sign on to a justice who might vote to overturn Citizens United , restore the Voting Rights Act , support Roe v. Wade , support public-employee unions in the Friedrichs case , and the many other matters on which the conservative majority has in essence been 5-4 for all these years ?\nFourteen is a big number . The election factors into this . There are some Republican senators from purple or blue states who might be hurt in their re-election bids by balls-to-the-wall obstruction . But there aren \u2019 t 14 . There are four . Rob Portman of Ohio , Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania , and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin .\nSo it \u2019 s a big climb . But bear in mind\u2014we are presumably going to see a series of deadlocked 4-4 decisions on a number of contentious issues . Will the American public sit still for that ? And bear further in mind\u2014the court may already have decided some of these cases , because they \u2019 ve heard them , and they \u2019 ve quite possibly voted on them . What happens after they vote is that they assign an opinion to someone . But they \u2019 re decided , so it \u2019 s not impossible that Scalia could reach up from the grave and have a part in deciding , by 5-4 , to dismantle public-employee unions . How would that sit with the public ?\nHere \u2019 s another weird scenario : a recess appointment . The Senate is going to be on Easter recess from March 21 to April 1 . What if Obama put somebody in during those 10 days ? There \u2019 s precedent\u2014in 1956 , another election year , Dwight Eisenhower made a recess appointment out of William Brennan . He stayed on the court until 1990 .\nDeval Patrick has been high on the White House \u2019 s list of court nominees before . The former Massachusetts governor is clearly qualified . But let \u2019 s face it\u2014the simple fact that he \u2019 s black would increase the opposition to him . I hate to write that sentence , but it \u2019 s true . That \u2019 s not because a guy like McConnell is a racist , but the GOP base , which is currently so animated by fears of white decline , would on some level hurt Patrick \u2019 s prospects .\nSri Srinivasan is a federal judge on the DC Circuit . He \u2019 s a past solicitor general who \u2019 s argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court , and he was fairly recently confirmed to his current job , in 2013 , by 97-0 . It might be hard for Republicans to explain how they \u2019 re backing away from 97-0 .\nSpeaking of the DC Circuit , it \u2019 s headed by Merrick Garland , appointed to the DC Circuit by Bill Clinton . He became the chief judge in 2013 . He \u2019 s considered a judicial moderate , and back in 2010 , Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch , always a big player in Supreme Court deliberations , said that Garland would be confirmed for the high court on a bipartisan basis , \u201c No question . \u201d\nNow let \u2019 s have some fun . Is there a respected Washington-insider type , a Washington lawyer , who is respected on both sides of the aisle in the way John Roberts was ? A Ron Klain type . Klain is a lawyer , and while he does have a political background , his most recent foray into public service involved helping to save hundreds of thousands of lives in West Africa , as the Ebola czar . There are surely others in this category , but my point is that it \u2019 s not a bad category for Obama to think about : A person senators know personally , who has the Washington stamp of approval .\nAnd speaking of people senators know personally : What about a senator ? Here \u2019 s a thought for you . Chuck Schumer . I ran this by two Democratic Senate aides , and they said ha ha\u2014but they didn \u2019 t say no . Schumer has been in the Senate almost 20 years . Most Republicans respect him . He actually tries to work across the aisle . They all know how smart he is . And he \u2019 s a lawyer . Harvard Law . Not even Ted Cruz could say with a straight face that he isn \u2019 t qualified . The NRA would go apeshit . And he \u2019 s in line to be the next Democratic leader .

But it brings the court to the fore , which is to say that it brings the question of electability to the fore .
