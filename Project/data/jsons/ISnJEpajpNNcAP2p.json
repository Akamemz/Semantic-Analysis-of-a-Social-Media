He also unveiled a new theme , saying that the U.S. would \u201c finally have a coherent foreign policy \u201d based on narrow self-interest , economic gain and global stability .\nBut Trump offered few specifics about his strategy , focusing on the alleged \u201c disasters \u201d created by past presidents and a foreign policy establishment who \u201c frankly don \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re doing , even though they may look awfully good writing for The New York Times or talking on television . \u201d\nTrump said he would surround himself with \u201c talented experts \u201d and \u201c new people \u201d to help him chart a global strategy .
