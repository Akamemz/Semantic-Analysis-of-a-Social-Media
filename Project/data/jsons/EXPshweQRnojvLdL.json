That \u2019 s set off a complicated race between hawks and the White House to win over an eclectic group of senators , each with his or her own particular concerns .\nAny casual sports fan can attest that an almost .800 winning percentage is no easy feat , but that \u2019 s what Obama and his Hill allies need to pull off . And people on both sides of the rancorous Iran debate concede they have no idea whether Obama and his congressional allies can get there .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine a liberal stalwart like Sen.

Among the enigmas are the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee , Maryland \u2019 s Ben Cardin , and Cory Booker , the star freshman from New Jersey caught between his loyalty to Obama and fierce opposition from Jewish groups .\n\u201c Each has their own particular or unique approach , \u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) . \u201c We \u2019 re going after any Senate Democrat . \u201d\n\u201c One of the reasons is that I \u2019 m confident we \u2019 re going to get 60 votes against the agreement , \u201d said former Sen.

A Jewish lawmaker from Baltimore, Cardin helped draft the law to give Congress a vote on the Iran deal with his triangulation between a White House that feared congressional oversight and Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), now an opponent of the deal.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat is a more conciliatory figure than Sen.

We share the desire for the Senate to appropriately vote on this issue,\u201d Corker said in a phone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re both grown-ups.\u201d\n\nCory Booker of New Jersey\n\nBooker is getting buffeted on Iran probably more than any of the remaining undecided Democrats \u2014 including by his state\u2019s voluble Republican governor and 2016 contender, Chris Christie.\n\nAt a news conference this week with Jewish leaders who oppose the pact, Christie called on all New Jersey lawmakers to oppose the Iran accord. But his real target was clear.\n\n\u201cFor Sen. Booker this morning, the people of your state, the people of this country and the people of the world are counting on you to be a strong, direct and powerful moral voice,\u201d Christie said at the event, held at the Chabad House at Rutgers University. \u201cTo look your president in the eye \u2014 to look our president in the eye \u2014 and say, \u2018No, Mr. President.

Coons has been one of the most publicly skeptical undecided Democrats and has spoken more with the White House on Iran than perhaps any other issue during his five-year run in the Senate.\n\nHe\u2019s also not settling for a mere press release to make news, instead holding a public announcement on Tuesday at the University of Delaware.\n\nAside from Cardin, he\u2019s the only undecided Democrat left on the Foreign Relations Committee. Obama spoke with Coons while the senator was on vacation earlier in August, and last week the senator met with constituent groups that included strong opponents of the deal, an aide said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been very responsive to the extent I\u2019ve got concerns and questions,\u201d Coons said of the White House before Congress left for its August recess. \u201cI\u2019ve had opportunities to raise them and try to resolve them.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, his senior colleague, Sen. Tom Carper, endorsed the agreement as a \u201cgood deal.\u201d\n\nMichael Bennet of Colorado\n\nThe sole vulnerable Democratic senator up for reelection in 2016, Bennet faces an added layer of pressure that\u2019s made him a prime target for both sides ahead of the Senate vote in September.\n\nThe first-term senator hinted this week he\u2019s leaning \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion that there is not a better deal available,\u201d he said at an energy event in Denver, though he added he\u2019s still making up his mind. \u201cWe are faced with a lot of bad choices now because we eliminated a lot of choices along the way.\u201d\n\nJ Street, a liberal pro-Israel group backing the deal, commissioned a poll earlier this month that showed 62 percent of Jewish voters in Colorado support the agreement \u2014 and called out Bennet for his noncommittal stance on the accord.\n\nBut he\u2019s also been pounded with pressure campaigns from anti-deal groups such as Secure America Now, which has orchestrated thousands of calls to Bennet\u2019s office urging the senator to oppose the agreement.\n\nBennet\u2019s support for the deal would be \u201ca clear indication that he will follow Obama\u2019s troubling direction on national security issues,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nRichard Blumenthal of Connecticut\n\nOn one hand, Blumenthal is hearing from the ultimate Democratic hawk, Joe Lieberman. On the other, his fellow home-state senator, Democrat Chris Murphy, is an active participant on the pro-deal whip team.\n\nBlumenthal has been a strong backer of congressional sanctions aimed at crippling Iran\u2019s economy. But he\u2019s keeping a low profile as Congress prepares to vote on the nuclear deal.\n\nIn an interview this summer, Blumenthal said he wouldn\u2019t be swayed by the decision of Schumer or any of the Democratic boosters of the agreement. \u201cThis issue is so consequential that the real guides here are going to be my personal conscience and conviction and all of the facts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Connecticut lawmaker is up for reelection in 2016 and may not want to cause waves among many of his liberal constituents. But Lieberman, who spoke with the senator this month, isn\u2019t letting him off easy.\n\n\u201cI hope and pray he opposes the agreement,\u201d Lieberman said. \u201cThis is the kind of agreement that Dick Blumenthal never would have negotiated.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal also met with liberal activists from MoveOn and other advocacy groups on Wednesday. The organizations have been deploying demonstrators to the offices of undecided Democratic senators.\n\n\u201cHe raised the expectations of the people there, that he\u2019s going to do the right thing,\u201d said Tom Swan, executive director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, who met with Blumenthal in Hartford.\n\nBlumenthal also spoke with opponents of the Iran deal who were holding their own protests on Wednesday, an aide said.\n\nManu Raju contributed to this report.",
