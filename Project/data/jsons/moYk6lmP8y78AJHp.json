During the heated political battle, conservative fiscal hawks must focus on protecting the two-year-old spending limits, or taxpayers could be burdened with an increasingly voracious and unrestrained federal budget.\n\nTo keep the federal government operating, Congress must pass some sort of funding legislation between now and Sept. 30, which marks the end of the 2013 fiscal year.
