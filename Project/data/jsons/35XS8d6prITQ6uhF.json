    "content": "The coronavirus lockdowns are starting to end across the country . Restaurants , bars , and offices are starting to reopen , and people are starting to go back to work .\nPresumably some of the economic damage caused by President Trump 's failure to contain the virus will begin to be undone . And because we are now at such a low point \u2014 more than 20 percent unemployment , GDP that has fallen off a cliff \u2014 the economic statistics for the third quarter of this year could conceivably show large figures in both growth and new jobs . Thus Democratic Party economist Jason Furman suggests Trump could have a strong political tailwind as election day approaches , and Democrats should be worried .\nBut there are reasons to be skeptical of this . Trump very well could win , but it will likely be in spite of a horrible economy , not because of it .\nThe background here is that roughly 40 million people have filed for unemployment , and about 30 million are collecting benefits under the expanded CARES Act unemployment insurance . The first quarter of 2020 saw the economy shrink at an estimated 4.8 percent annualized rate ( which will likely be revised downward when further data comes in ) , and the second quarter will surely be much , much worse . But now that people are starting to go back about their normal activities , there may be some recovery . Since the economy is flat on its back , even a partial recovery will be recorded as a huge improvement from the terrible baseline .\nFurman is likely drawing on the latest conventional wisdom in political science , which holds that voters are innumerate morons who have almost no idea what is happening to them . For instance , in the 2016 book Democracy for Realists , political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels present data that in the 1936 election , voters tended to reward Franklin Roosevelt myopically , voting for him in greater numbers if their state saw income gains in that year only \u2014 giving him little credit for growth in 1935 or 1934 . Their case is overstated , but that has n't stopped their general argument from being embraced by liberals like Matt Yglesias and Furman \u2014 if the growth numbers are good right before the election , then by this view voters will mechanically reward Trump even if it 's a partial bounce-back from a collapse he caused himself through his own ineptitude .\nThere are several other problems with this argument in the current situation .

Though both new cases and deaths have fallen from the heights of April , daily new cases have averaged about 20,000 per day , daily deaths over 1,000 , for the past two weeks . Some states , like Vermont , Hawaii , Montana , and Alaska , have nearly eradicated the disease . But in others , like Florida , North Carolina , Wisconsin , and Alabama , they are still increasing .\nInsofar as easing lockdowns leads to people congregating in confined spaces and talking close to one another for a long time \u2014 like going out to dinner \u2014 all evidence suggests the pandemic will be fueled . That will surely be worsened by the developing ideology on the right that wearing a mask is for beta male liberals . It 's quite surprising that so far New York City is the only place in the U.S. that has suffered a fully out-of-control outbreak , but neither is there any sign that rural or suburban states are immune .

Trump has done almost nothing to contain the virus nationally , and he is n't going to start .
