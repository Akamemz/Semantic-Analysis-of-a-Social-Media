It `` confirms , in our view , that there is no remaining doubt that it was the regime that used chemical weapons . ''\nAnd Samantha Power , the U.S. ambassador , said a preliminary review of the report points toward forces loyal to al-Assad .\n`` The regime possesses sarin , and we have no evidence that the opposition possesses sarin , '' Power said . `` It defies logic '' to think members of the opposition would have infiltrated a regime-controlled area to fire on opposition-controlled areas .\nBritain , France , and NATO have also said al-Assad 's regime was behind the attack . But Russia is Syria 's leading ally , and Russian U.N . Ambassador Vitaly Churkin maintained Moscow 's stance that Syrian rebels might be to blame .\nSuch suggestions `` can not be simply shrugged off , '' Churkin said , and statements insisting that the opposition could not have launched the attack `` are not as scientific and grounded in reality as the actual situation could be . '' He questioned why rebel forces did n't report major losses in the August 21 chemical attack , which the United States says may have killed more than 1,400 , including hundreds of civilians .\nThe August 21 attack led to U.S. calls for military action against Syria , which denies its forces unleashed chemical weapons and blamed rebel fighters for the deaths . Syria has since agreed to join the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and hand over its chemical arsenal to international inspectors , with the United States and Russia laying out a fast-paced framework for Damascus to follow .\nMonday 's report presents a stark picture of the damage that can be inflicted by a nerve agent like sarin , one of three types of poison gas Syria is believed to have stockpiled\n`` Survivors reported that following an attack with shelling , they quickly experienced a range of symptoms , including shortness of breath , disorientation , eye irritation , blurred vision , nausea , vomiting and general weakness , '' Ban said . `` Many eventually lost consciousness . First responders described seeing a large number of individuals lying on the ground , many of them dead or unconscious . ''\nThe weather made things worse . Falling temperatures at the time of the attack meant the downward movement of air , allowing the gas `` to easily penetrate the basements and lower levels of buildings and other structures where many people were seeking shelter , '' Ban said .\nInspectors interviewed survivors and first responders , collected hair , urine and blood samples and took soil and environmental samples from the sites where the rockets fell . The secretary-general said the team `` adhered to the most stringent protocols available for such an investigation , including to ensure the chain of custody for all samples . ''\nMore than 100,000 people had already been killed in Syria before August 21 , according to the United Nations .
