That 's not much changed from a June AP-GfK survey , when the split was 47 percent for the president to 44 percent for Romney .\nAfter just over a week on the campaign trail , Ryan has a 38 percent favorable rating among adults , while 34 percent see him unfavorably . Among registered voters , his numbers are slightly better -- 40 percent favorable to 34 percent unfavorable . Ryan remains unknown to about a quarter of voters .\nThe Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed a similar dynamic . The survey out Wednesday showed Obama leading Romney 48-44 percent , about where the race was a month ago . The margin of error was 3 percentage points , in the poll of 1,000 registered voters taken Aug. 16-20 .\nVoters were closely divided on the question of Ryan . Twenty-two percent said the Ryan choice made them more likely to back Romney , while 23 percent said the opposite . More than half said it would make no difference in their vote .\nRomney put the 42-year-old conservative chairman of the House Budget Committee on the ticket Aug. 11 .

The Democrats hold their convention the following week in Charlotte , N.C .\nThe closely locked contest reflects deep partisan divisions across the country .\nAmong true independents in the AP-GfK poll , those who say they do not lean toward either party , the share of undecided voters is declining , with each candidate picking up new support at about the same pace . However , Romney maintains a small advantage with the group , with the backing of 41 percent of independents to Obama 's 30 percent . Some 21 percent still say they support neither candidate .\nAmong all voters , 23 percent are undecided or say they have not yet committed to their candidate .\nRegistered voters split about evenly between the two candidates on whom they 'd trust more to handle the economy , with 48 percent favoring Romney and 44 percent Obama .

Among independent voters , Romney has a big lead over the president on handling the economy -- 46 percent to 27 percent .\nObama holds a clear edge among voters on handling social issues such as abortion , 52 percent to 35 percent , and a narrow one on handling Medicare , 48 percent to 42 percent .
