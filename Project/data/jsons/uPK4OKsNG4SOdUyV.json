By August 2011, the rule was amended to exempt certain religious employers, such as churches, synagogues and other houses of worship, from offering such coverage.\n\nBut other religiously affiliated organizations, including colleges and hospitals, were not exempt, and religious groups objected.\n\nSo, in February, the Obama administration announced what it called a compromise in which free contraception coverage still must be offered to employees of religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals, but health insurers -- rather than the employers -- would have to cover the cost.\n\nChurches and other houses of worship retained the full exemption, meaning women who worked there had no guarantee of full contraception coverage\n\nThe requirement went into effect August 1, though the non-exempt religiously affiliated institutions such as colleges and hospitals can have up to August 1, 2013, to comply.\n\nSome conservatives and religious groups, including some affiliated with the Catholic Church, continued to object, saying the rule still infringed on religious liberty and set a dangerous precedent by distinguishing between church and church-affiliated groups for conscience clauses.\n\nRomney has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, which includes the contraceptives rule.\n\nHe also opposes the contraceptives rule specifically.

Romney, while not opposing the availability of contraception, opposes the contraception rule, arguing it forces some religious institutions to go against their faith.",
