Bobby Jindal of Louisiana fiercely shot back at Mitt Romney \u2019 s claim Wednesday that President Barack Obama outmatched the 2012 Republican presidential nominee by offering `` gifts '' to African-Americans , Hispanics and young voters .\n\u201c I absolutely reject that notion , \u201d Jindal , who was a surrogate for Romney \u2019 s campaign , said at the Republican Governors Association conference in Las Vegas . \u201c I think that 's absolutely wrong . \u201d\n\u201c I do n't think that represents where we are as a party and where we 're going as a party , \u201d he continued . \u201c That has got to be one of the most fundamental takeaways from this election . \u201d\nRomney made the comments on a call with top donors Wednesday afternoon , various news outlets have reported . The former Massachusetts governor also made similar arguments on a separate call earlier in the morning , CNN confirmed .\n`` What the president , president 's campaign did was focus on certain members of his base coalition , give them extraordinary financial gifts from the government , and then work very aggressively to turn them out to vote , '' Romney said in the afternoon call , according to audio aired on ABC News .\nRomney , who lost to Obama by 126 electoral votes , said the president courted voters by offering policies - some of them this election year - that appealed to key constituencies .\n`` With regards to the young people , for instance , a forgiveness of college loan interest , was a big gift , '' Romney said , according to The New York Times .\n`` Free contraceptives were very big with young college-aged women , '' he continued . `` And then , finally , Obamacare also made a difference for them , because as you know , anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents ' plan , and that was a big gift to young people . They turned out in large numbers , a larger share in this election even than in 2008 . ''\nThe president 's health care reform plan , he added , also brought out support from African Americans and Hispanic voters .\n`` You can imagine for somebody making $ 25,000 or $ 30,000 or $ 35,000 a year , being told you 're now going to get free health care , particularly if you do n't have it , getting free health care worth , what , $ 10,000 per family , in perpetuity , I mean , this is huge , '' he said . `` Likewise with Hispanic voters , free health care was a big plus . But in addition with regards to Hispanic voters , the amnesty for children of illegals , the so-called Dream Act kids , was a huge plus for that voting group . ''\nBut Jindal , when asked about Romney \u2019 s remarks , said in order for the GOP to be \u201c competitive , \u201d it has to \u201c go after 100 percent of the votes , not 53 percent .
