    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Attorney General William Barr said he would form a team to examine the origins of a 2016 counterintelligence investigation that conducted what he termed as \u201c spying \u201d on people affiliated with the Trump campaign , a characterization Democrats said was politically motivated and echoed the president \u2019 s longstanding criticism of the Justice Department \u2019 s Russia probe .\nAt a Senate hearing on Wednesday , Mr. Barr said the team would look at what lay behind the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2019 s probe of the Trump campaign \u2019 s possible ties to Russia , which included surveillance , and was later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller .\n\u201c I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal , \u201d Mr. Barr said , invoking Vietnam-era intelligence abuses such as the surveillance of antiwar activists as a reason to raise these questions . \u201c Spying did occur . The question is whether it was adequately predicated . \u201d\nPresident Trump and his Republican congressional allies have long alleged that his associates were unfairly targeted for surveillance , and that investigators in the Justice Department and the FBI were politically prejudiced against Mr. Trump in a way that could have affected their work .\nTwo FBI employees , a lawyer and top counterintelligence official , left the bureau after it was revealed they exchanged text messages critical of Mr. Trump while working on matters related to the Russia investigation . A critical watchdog report said their texts \u201c sowed doubt \u201d about the FBI \u2019 s work but that their political views didn \u2019 t affect their decisions .\nMr. Barr \u2019 s move immediately provoked questions on Capitol Hill from Democrats who rebuked Mr. Barr for his implication that legitimate investigative activities into Russian interference should be considered \u201c spying . \u201d\n\u201c The president has already done tremendous damage to our institutions , to the Justice Department , to the FBI , to the intelligence community , and I would hope the attorney general as the top law enforcement officer in the land wouldn \u2019 t make careless suggestions about the FBI spying on a political campaign , \u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff ( D. , Calif. ) , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .\nThe inquiry by Mr. Barr \u2019 s team will mark the third ongoing investigation\u2014including one being conducted by the Justice Department \u2019 s inspector general\u2014of the department \u2019 s actions in connection with the 2016 counterintelligence probe .\nMr. Barr \u2019 s confirmation as attorney general less than two months ago was viewed by many Justice Department employees as a chance to steady an agency rocked recently by political storms . But his Wednesday remarks and his handling of Mr. Mueller \u2019 s report on any Russian ties to the Trump campaign have opened Mr. Barr to criticism , especially from Democrats , that he is further pushing the traditionally independent department into the political fray .\nDavid Laufman , who oversaw the early stages of the Russia investigation as a supervisor at the Justice Department , said he was disturbed by Mr. Barr \u2019 s comments . \u201c It appears to be a weaponization of the department in service of political retribution by the White House and congressional Republicans , \u201d Mr. Laufman said . Some of Mr. Laufman \u2019 s decisions may now be re-examined .\nReferencing Mr. Barr \u2019 s appearances on Capitol Hill this week , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) said Wednesday it is \u201c very , very dismaying and disappointing that the chief law enforcement officer of our country is going off the rails , yesterday and today. \u201d The California Democrat added that Mr. Barr is \u201c the attorney general of the United States of America and not the attorney general of Donald Trump . \u201d\nMr. Barr didn \u2019 t elaborate on what he meant by spying . A person familiar with his thinking said he wasn \u2019 t using the word in a pejorative sense but rather to refer to \u201c intelligence collection \u201d generally . Several matters that occurred during the 2016 campaign and its aftermath have been referred to as spying by critics of the investigation\u2014including the use of a human informant to collect information on Trump associates and the application for four surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page .\nThe counterintelligence investigation opened in the summer of 2016 against four Trump campaign aides eventually morphed into the two-year probe conducted by Mr. Mueller , which concluded last month . Mr. Trump himself wasn \u2019 t part of the initial counterintelligence probe\u2014but the special counsel did investigate whether he obstructed justice .\nThe attorney general told members of Congress he was concerned about the possibility that not all of the decisions made by Justice Department officials were proper in the counterintelligence probe . \u201c I want to satisfy myself that there was no abuse of law enforcement or intelligence powers , \u201d Mr. Barr said .\nMr. Trump praised the move by his new attorney general on Wednesday . \u201c What has been found during this period of time are the illegal acts of getting this whole phony investigation started , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c And hopefully that \u2019 s where people are going now . \u201d\nRepublican allies of Mr. Trump said Mr. Barr was taking needed steps to hold officials accountable . \u201c We have been calling for this for a long time , and now that this has played out as it has\u2014no collusion whatsoever\u2014it begs the question : how did this two year witch hunt get initiated ? \u201d said Chris Collins ( R. , N.Y. ) .\nMr. Mueller \u2019 s inquiry ultimately led to the convictions of five Trump advisers , several of whom admitted to misleading investigators about their contacts with Russian officials or intermediaries , and the indictment of two dozen Russian citizens , including numerous intelligence officers .\nNone of the charges against Trump associates were directly related to conspiracy or collusion with Russia . Several of Mr. Trump \u2019 s associates have been convicted on crimes related to trying to impede the investigation , such as witness tampering , obstruction and lying to investigators . Numerous Russians were charged with crimes related to election interference , but most are unlikely to be extradited or arrested .\nMr. Barr , who has been reviewing Mr. Mueller \u2019 s roughly 400-page report , said in a four-page summary sent to Congress on March 24 that Mr. Mueller \u2019 s team didn \u2019 t find that Mr. Trump and his campaign had conspired or coordinated with Russia \u2019 s interference in the 2016 election , but hadn \u2019 t made a \u201c traditional prosecutorial decision \u201d on whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice during the probe .
