    "content": "This has nothing to do with Minneapolis , but there appears to be a real lack of understanding about police work on the part of many of the general public . Mainly because no one ever took the time to try to explain how cops do their jobs . Most people form their opinions about the police and how they operate based on what they see on TV or in the movies .\nSo here \u2019 s a chance to test your knowledge on exactly how police do their jobs , and why police officers do certain things that often times don \u2019 t look so good on television .\n1 ) Why do police officers take people down to the ground ? Because they \u2019 re taught that it is easier to control a resisting suspect , or a suspect who is just starting to resist once you have them down on the ground . You can pin them down and get them handcuffed . This is also done to not only help prevent injury to the officer that might occur during a protracted struggle , but injuries to the suspect as well . And sometimes both officers and suspects just fall down . Feet often get tangled up , and weight shifts with someone who is struggling and resisting , balance is lost and suddenly everyone ends up in a pile on the ground . Once on the ground an officer does his best to recover control of and hold the suspect down until help can arrive .\n2 ) Do suspects often still try to fight and resist after being handcuffed ? The short answer is \u2018 yes , and often. \u2019 It also regularly happens as a suspect is being escorted to and gets next to the police vehicle . It suddenly dawns on them that they really are going to jail and many will fight violently at that point . Handcuffed suspects can also still be dangerous ( \u2018 St . Louis Police Officer Robert Stanze \u2019 a case in point . He was shot and killed by a suspect who had a hidden gun and who was handcuffed behind his back and seated in the police car . Or Missouri State Trooper James Froemsdorf who was shot and killed by his own gun by a suspect who was able to slip out of the handcuffs due to a previous hand injury and grabbed the Trooper \u2019 s gun and shot him several times , killing him on the side of a Missouri highway ) . Other handcuffed suspects have slipped out of their cuffs and escaped , or killed the officer , or perhaps even took an innocent bystander as a hostage after they escaped .\n3 ) Do suspects stop fighting only to resume fighting after catching their breath ? Yes . Which is why police officers will maintain control over them , using tactics like leverage , take down and control techniques , batons , pepper spray , and tasers that they are trained in and certified to use . Sometimes it comes down to just brute strength and additional officers piling onto a particularly violent or large and strong suspect . None of this looks particularly good to the uninformed TV viewer , and to an untrained and uninformed eye may appear to be excessive force when often really it \u2019 s a struggle for the officer \u2019 s very life .\nAll police departments maintain and update regularly a Policy Manual , SOP , General Orders Manual ( different names , same thing ) , that gives guidance , and department rules and regulations governing everything an officer does , including a \u2018 Use of Force \u2019 policy . Each officer has a personal copy of this manual . These manuals are continually under review by department legal experts and officers regularly received updates , deletions , corrections , or further guidance to their manuals . Use of Force policies receive a thorough legal review and are based on court rulings and precedent , up to and including the U.S. Supreme Court which may ultimately rule , or has ruled already on the Constitutionality of the use of force .\nAll officers receive basic training in the police academy on most of these tactics . By successfully completing academy training police officers are considered trained and competent , and are then authorized to use these tactics while doing their job .\nAs new tactics and techniques or technologies are introduced into police work , officers are trained to use them and then certified as having successfully completed the training . With a certificate usually going into their personnel file . This is recorded in order to protect the officer and his department from lawsuits claiming an officer was not trained to use a certain technique or type of equipment , and a suspect was injured as a result .\nIn essence , if a tactic , technique , or piece of equipment is formally approved for officers to use , a policy is written guiding its use and is placed into the Policy Manual . If he is operating within the department \u2019 s policies then his actions are considered as being done in good faith , and following department policy and regulations . Officers are expected to abide by department policy , and with regards to techniques and tactics , \u201c to employ them to the best of an officer \u2019 s ability . \u201d\n4 ) Do officers have discretion and can choose not to arrest people for committing a crime ? Yes . Police Officers do have a limited amount of discretion when it comes to how they handle a minor offense . Which is why people are often let go with a warning instead of a speeding ticket . Rarely if ever is a person who is committing a felony not placed under arrest and conveyed to the police station for further investigation , or eventual transport to and confinement in the county jail . It varies from state to state , but officers have a limited amount of time to present their case to the prosecutor \u2019 s office for warrant application , and then it must be signed by a judge setting bail and release conditions .\nDo police officers often go ahead and arrest someone for what may seem to be a minor offense that doesn \u2019 t seem to be worth getting involved in a `` resisting '' event ? Ever heard of `` hunches \u201d ? Yes , police will often make a full custody arrest for a minor offense because they suspect there may be more going on , and they need to buy themselves some time to investigate more thoroughly . This often leads to solving a major crime . Think of Ted Bundy and many other notorious criminals who were at first arrested for something minor , but later their true identity or criminal activity was discovered . It happens often and what started out as an arrest for a minor offense turns out to be `` damn good police work . ''\n5 ) Why do officers shoot a suspect multiple times , it seems excessive ? Because officers are trained to \u201c shoot until the threat is over. \u201d If an officer shoots someone ten times it \u2019 s because he was still standing and shooting at them , or charging towards them and still a threat when that tenth bullet hit them .\n6 ) Can citizens file a complaint on a police officer ? Yes , it happens all the time . Officers are expected to maintain professional conduct both on and off duty . They are expected to carry out their duties in a professional and fair manner , and abide by all laws and department regulations . The nature of the complaint that is `` sustained against the officer '' ( found credible or proved ) will determine the level of departmental disciplinary action , or even a criminal complaint if appropriate . An officer can receive a counseling from a supervisor , a verbal reprimand , a written reprimand , suspension , termination , and also be arrested .\nOfficers also receive countless false charges levied against them all the time . The criminal element and those that associate with them know full well that they can ruin an officer \u2019 s day and cause grief by making a false allegation . Any allegation made has to be investigated by Internal Affairs . Officers are often charged with \u201c Unprofessional Conduct \u201d because for good reason they told a citizen to depart an area , or something similar , and the citizen didn \u2019 t want to do it . So the officer spoke louder and more forcefully , perhaps threatening arrest for noncompliance . Next thing you know a complaint is then filed for \u201c Unprofessional Conduct , \u201d with both sides being interviewed . Usually complaints of this nature are quickly dismissed for lack of evidence . Oftentimes citizens wishing to complain are required to come to the police station to put the complaint in writing , and they very often decline . No written complaint ? Complaint dismissed . Often \u201c excessive force \u201d is claimed because an officer had to use force to effect an arrest . This is always a judgement call for Internal Affairs . Are there injuries to the citizen , or to the officer ? Do the injuries reflect excessive force ? If not and there are no other witnesses or evidence , the complaint is generally dismissed or `` unsustained . '' Officers are allowed to use force necessary to arrest and to defend themselves . Many people view `` any '' force as excessive because it doesn \u2019 t look good on TV .\nPolice officers themselves want dirty cops gone . They reflect poorly on all the good ones . But they also know that false allegations , or unfair allegations , also happen far too often .\n7 ) Shouldn \u2019 t police officers be able to defend themselves without resorting to weapons or force ? Police officers come in all shapes and sizes . Both men and women . Most departments have fitness standards and officers are expected to do their best to maintain department standards . Unfortunately police officers spend much of their careers sedentary , riding around in a police car . Not unlike many of us , police officers often lead an unhealthy lifestyle . Eating unhealthy fast food meals , eating quickly , not exercising . Also , physiologically most men are larger , stronger , and more powerful than most women . Do we relegate women to being Meter Maids , or not allow them to be police officers because they may not be strong enough to defend themselves without resorting to using guns or other weapons ? My guess is a lot of people would be unhappy with that . And justifiably so .\nDo police officers make mistakes ? Absolutely , they \u2019 re human , not RoboCop machines . They work in mostly `` gray '' areas where they have to make decisions , often without any help or guidance , and only their instincts and best judgment and training to rely on .\nEveryone has a `` what about '' or `` what if '' comment . Or the `` bad cop '' story they like to share . Most stories likely aren \u2019 t firsthand accounts , aren \u2019 t true , or are embellished greatly . Some people have a visceral dislike for authority and the police in general , and they will never believe anything other than the negative perceptions and comments they hear that line up with their own thinking . No sense in wasting time trying to convince them of anything .\nBut for the rest of you reading this , most police officers are honorable men and women who serve their communities in a very difficult , often dangerous , and ever changing landscape . They deserve our support , just as those corrupt individuals within their ranks deserve our contempt . But the good ones far outnumber the bad ones .\nSo take a moment during these tough times to let good police officers know that you \u2019 ve got their back .",
