People are not at all willing to give up , '' one activist told Fox News from the streets of Iran .\n`` Their patience has come to an end and they have nothing to lose . Iran will surely not fall down and people will not retreat from their demands . ''\nThe defiance comes as President Trump announced Friday that he is waving sanctions against Iran under the controversial 2015 nuclear deal one last time , and gave the European allies four months to change the terms of the agreement or he may seek to scrap it .\n`` They should impose major sanctions on the regime , '' one protester demanded . Another added there `` should be sanctions for human rights violations . ''\nThe protesters are members of the long banned opposition group , the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI , also known as the MEK ) . The group 's leader , Maryam Rajavi , has been directly blamed by the Iranian government for fomenting the unrest .\nSocial media videos show supporters unveiling large banners with Rajavi 's photo over highway overpasses , and continuing their opposition .\nThe group is calling for Iran \u2019 s oil exports to also be subject to sanctions , the ability of the Tehran regime to access the international banking system to be cut off , as well as other punitive measures .\nThe activists predict stronger methods will work , and are thanking the president and the American public for keeping up the pressure .\n`` We thank you President Trump . We call on all of the supporters of the people who press this regime from different fronts , to put pressure with you and overthrow with us , '' the activist told Fox News in broken English .\nHe and others said they are grateful that the Trump administration is expressing support for the resistance that has been staging many of the protests . The demonstrations started Dec. 28 , and the government claims that they have largely been quelled .\nThat is why the activists are looking to the United States for inspiration -- and more help .\n`` Iranian people want to achieve a democratic and independent government , and play a role in it , '' said one .\n`` In Iran taxis and buses and public places , you heard people talking that they are happy that the United States and President Trump is actually taking actions on the side of the Iranian people and as you know , the overthrow of this regime and establishment of a free country is in the interest of the entire world .\n\u201c This support should continue , and years of appeasement should end . People are very determined and do not retreat despite this severe crackdown . ''\nThe demonstrators deny the protests are largely over . Videos posted on social media show activists attacking government outposts , such as firebombing police stations , destroying government property , and chanting anti-regime slogans .\nFox News interviewed the protesters through a social media app that demonstrators have been using to evade the government crackdown on the internet .\nThe protesters we interviewed asked that their locations remain hidden , and their voices altered or not even used at all , out of fears that they could be identified by the government and arrested .\nBut they all expressed a common goal . They insisted the movement will not end until the hardline theocratic regime is finally ousted .\n`` To reach this goal they know the value of the support , '' one activist told us .\nThe support from the White House has included President Trump 's harsh criticism of the regime and its treatment of the demonstrators .\nOn Jan. 3 , Trump tweeted : `` Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government . You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time ! ''\nEarlier this week a White House statement condemned the regime and its mass arrests of protesters . It also said `` reports that the regime has tortured or killed some of these demonstrators while in detention are even more disturbing .
