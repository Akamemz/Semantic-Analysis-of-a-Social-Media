The previous Times/Zogby polls showed the race a dead heat \u2014 including just before the national party conventions , when they were tied with 45.7 percent of the vote each . Even with third-party candidates added to the mix , the results barely changed .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s support is growing even as voters are split on whether they are better off than they were four years ago \u2014 the key question Mr. Romney poses on the campaign trail \u2014 and even as voters said they weren \u2019 t happy with the president \u2019 s handling of the attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts three weeks ago .\n\u201c If Obama were running against himself , \u2018 Would you vote for Obama , yes or no , ? \u2019 this would be a much closer race . To a great degree , it \u2019 s all about Mitt Romney right now , and the judgment today is he doesn \u2019 t appear to be a suitable alternative , including for people who don \u2019 t want to vote for Obama , \u201d said John Zogby , the pollster who conducted the survey .\n\u201c Now , it \u2019 s not over \u2014 oh , absolutely , it \u2019 s not over . No prediction here . But [ Mr. Romney ] is on the ropes , \u201d he said .\nThe poll of 800 likely voters , taken Thursday through Saturday , has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points . Those who didn \u2019 t have a definitive choice for president were asked which way they leaned , and those were included in the head-to-head tally .\nThe survey , which was weighted for demographic purposes , tracks with other national surveys that show Mr. Obama gaining momentum as the election nears , and shows Mr. Romney \u2019 s window closing .\nIndeed , 57 percent of voters now say they expect Mr. Obama to cruise to re-election , which is up 10 percentage points from just before the parties \u2019 national conventions . The higher expectations hold true across the ideological spectrum , with Democrats , Republicans and independents becoming more convinced of Mr. Obama \u2019 s success .\nAnalysts said Mr. Obama got an initial bump out of his convention in early September , and then Mr. Romney stumbled for several weeks , particularly with the release of a video of him telling a closed-door group of donors this year that 47 percent of voters are dependent on government and see themselves as \u201c victims. \u201d He said he didn \u2019 t expect to win the support of those people .\nAsked in the poll , 41 percent of voters agreed with Mr. Romney \u2014 about equal to the support he is getting overall .\nMeanwhile , 40 percent of voters , including 68 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of independents , \u201c strongly disagreed \u201d with Mr. Romney \u2019 s remark .\nSpeaking on \u201c Fox News Sunday , \u201d Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan said Mr. Romney had been \u201c inarticulate \u201d with the comment , but added that Republicans believe the president has fostered an atmosphere of dependence on the federal government .\n\u201c Here and there , we have not been able to frame that choice as clearly [ as we have wanted ] , \u201d he said . \u201c I really believe that by the end of this day , people are going to understand what they \u2019 ve got and the choices that they have . \u201d\nThe Times/Zogby poll had good news for Mr. Obama across the board . He led Mr. Romney in each of five areas : jobs and the economy , national security , immigration , energy and foreign affairs .\nIn fact , Mr. Obama has gained ground on every one of those areas since The Times/Zogby poll last asked about them in May , including an 8-percentage-point leap when voters are asked who would do better on jobs and the economy . In May , Mr. Romney led that category 52 percent to 46 percent , but Mr. Obama now leads 49 percent to 44 percent .\nMr. Romney also is hurting because of the number of voters who feel they don \u2019 t know him as well as Mr. Obama .\nThe poll asked voters to rank how well they felt they knew Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama on a scale of one to five , with five being \u201c very well. \u201d About 42 percent ranked Mr. Romney a four or five , while 71 percent ranked Mr. Obama a four or five .\nMr. Zogby said that is both a problem and a potential opportunity , particularly when the two men face off Wednesday in the first debate of the season .\n\u201c Essentially , Romney still has a net negative in terms of favorable-unfavorable ; however , there \u2019 s still a considerable number of people who know him or don \u2019 t know him , \u201d he said . \u201c This race should be closer than it is , and perhaps it will be .
