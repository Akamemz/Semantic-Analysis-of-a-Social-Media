''\nRecent incidents of anti-Semitic tweets and posts from sports and entertainment celebrities are a very troubling omen for the future of the Black Lives Matter movement , but so too is the shocking lack of massive indignation . Given the New Woke-fulness in Hollywood and the sports world , we expected more passionate public outrage . What we got was a shrug of meh-rage .\nWhen reading the dark squishy entrails of popular culture , meh-rage in the face of sustained prejudice is an indisputable sign of the coming Apatholypse : apathy to all forms of social justice . After all , if it \u2019 s OK to discriminate against one group of people by hauling out cultural stereotypes without much pushback , it must be OK to do the same to others . Illogic begets illogic .\nIce Cube \u2019 s June 10 daylong series of tweets , which involved some creepy symbols and images , in general implied that Jews were responsible for the oppression of blacks . NFL player DeSean Jackson tweeted out several anti-Semitic messages , including a quote he incorrectly thought was from Hitler ( not your go-to guy for why-can \u2019 t-we-all-get-along quotes ) stating that Jews had a plan to \u201c extort America \u201d and achieve \u201c world domination. \u201d Isn \u2019 t that SPECTRE \u2019 s job in James Bond movies ?\nThese statements would be laughed at by anyone with a middle-school grasp of reason , but then former NBA player Stephen Jackson , a self-proclaimed activist , undid whatever progress his previous advocacy may have achieved by agreeing with DeSean Jackson on social media . Then he went on to talk about the Rothschilds owning all the banks and his support for the notorious homophobe and anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan . That is the kind of dehumanizing characterization of a people that causes the police abuses that killed his friend , George Floyd .\nJune continued to bust out all over with anti-Semitism when performer Chelsea Handler , herself Jewish , posted videos of Farrakhan to her 3.9 million followers . That means almost 4 million people received a subliminal message that even some Jews think being anti-Jewish is justified .\nThat same month , President Donald Trump \u2019 s reelection campaign also has been criticized for exploiting anti-Jewish biases , even though Trump \u2019 s son-in-law and campaign honcho Jared Kushner is Jewish and his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism before they married . Playing on the same Rothschild \u2019 s trope , they issued a letter accusing three billionaires of Jewish descent of using their fortunes to \u201c rig the November election. \u201d This is the kind of \u201c very fine people on both sides \u201d Trump has employed throughout his political career \u2014 pandering to hate groups that has emboldened racists who feel like they \u2019 ve gotten the presidential OK to attack people they don \u2019 t like .\nThese famous , outspoken people share the same scapegoat logic as all oppressive groups from Nazis to the KKK : all our troubles are because of bad-apple groups that worship wrong , have the wrong complexion , come from the wrong country , are the wrong gender or love the wrong gender . It \u2019 s so disheartening to see people from groups that have been violently marginalized do the same thing to others without realizing that perpetuating this kind of bad logic is what perpetuates racism .\nYes , some of the above have apologized \u2014 DeSean Jackson , Stephen Jackson , Chelsea Handler \u2014 while others continue to defiantly marinate in their own prejudice . Their arrogant and irrational response to accusations of anti-Semitism , rather than dissuade us , actually confirmed people \u2019 s worst opinions . Ice Cube \u2019 s response was remorseless : \u201c What if I was just pro-Black ? This is the truth brother . I didn \u2019 t lie on anyone . I didn \u2019 t say I was anti anybody . DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE . I \u2019 ve been telling my truth. \u201d His \u201c truth \u201d was clearly anti-Semitic but , like Trump , he believes his truth exists outside facts .
