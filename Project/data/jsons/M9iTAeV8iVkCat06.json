He also said he was dismayed that the Alabama Republican did not commit to following through on the recommendations outlined in a forthcoming report by the justice department\u2019s civil rights division on the Chicago police department\u2019s use of force.\n\nBefore the meeting ended, Durbin said he offered Sessions the book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide by Carol Anderson. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll take a look at it,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Tillerson met members of the foreign relations committee on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, one week before he is scheduled to testify before them.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said he was \u201cgenerally encouraged\u201d by his conversation with Tillerson, although he said he wanted to hear more before deciding whether to support his nomination.\n\nSeveral senators, including Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, have raised concerns about Tillerson\u2019s posture towards Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.\n\nCoons took issue with the confirmation schedule, saying next week seemed too soon for members to hold a hearing on Tillerson, given Republicans\u2019 current plans to also vote on repealing Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law.\n\nTo rush the confirmation process \u201cstrikes me as trying to get too many things done at the same time\u201d, he said, adding that he had been up all night preparing for his meeting with Tillerson.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 list also includes Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier and prospective head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Tom Price, a prominent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, for secretary of health and human services, Andy Puzder, a fast food executive and critic of raising the minimum wage, as labor secretary, Congressman Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal conservative, as director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Betsy DeVos, a staunch supporter of school choice, Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee.\n\nAfter a meeting with DeVos on Wednesday, Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, said in a statement that she continued to have \u201cserious concerns\u201d about DeVos\u2019s \u201clong record of working to privatize and defund public education, expand taxpayer-funded private school vouchers, and block accountability for charter schools, including for-profit charter schools\u201d.\n\nConfirmation hearings are scheduled to begin for Trump\u2019s cabinet picks next week, with several already slated for 11 January. But before they get under way, Democrats are demanding at least two days of hearings for each cabinet nominee and have requested that they do not overlap so that members can \u201cspend a lot of time studying\u201d for them.\n\n\u201cI would like to succeed in negotiating something where we get full and fair hearings \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to be dilatory \u2013 and hear what these nominees have to say,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere are so many issues about so many of them that to rush them through would be a disservice to the American people.\u201d\n\nIn response, Republicans are now accusing Democrats of obstructionism, an echo of the charge levied by Democrats against Republicans during the Obama years.\n\nThe majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he expected the Senate to be ready to confirm a number of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees shortly after Inauguration Day, on 20 January, adding that in 2009 the Senate approved seven of Barack Obama\u2019s nominees.\n\n\u201cI believe all the president-elect\u2019s cabinet appointments will be confirmed,\u201d McConnell told reporters on Wednesday, speaking before Schumer. \u201cI think it would be great if the Democrats would understand that, particularly with regard to the national security team, the secretary of defense, CIA, homeland security, it would make a lot of sense to have those folks in place on day one and I hope we\u2019re getting to the point where that will be possible.\u201d\n\nSchumer scoffed at the notion of a precedent. \u201cLeader McConnell has talked about the fact that a lot of nominees were approved in President Obama\u2019s first few days after he was inaugurated, but they all had their paperwork in early, their ethics reports, their 90-day plan to extricate themselves from conflicts, their FBI briefings,\u201d he said.\n\nAbsent from the list of nominees Democrats are targeting is Marine General James Mattis, Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary, who will need a congressional waiver to be confirmed.\n\nAfter meeting privately with Mattis on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, said she still opposed a waiver of the law that requires that defense secretaries be removed from the military for at least seven years.\n\n\u201cHe has served our country admirably,\u201d Gillibrand told reporters after their meeting. \u201cHe is well-regarded as an extraordinary general, and I am very grateful for that service, and I\u2019m very grateful that he\u2019s willing to continue his service for the president-elect. But I still believe that civilian control of our military is fundamental to the American democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Senate is also preparing for a pitched battle over Trump\u2019s future choice to replace Antonin Scalia on the supreme court, which will require 60 votes.\n\n\u201cApparently, there\u2019s yet a new standard which is to not confirm a supreme court nominee at all,\u201d McConnell said on Wednesday, referring to a remark Schumer made the previous evening on MSNBC that Democrats would \u201cabsolutely\u201d keep the vacancy open if the nominee were outside the mainstream. \u201cI think that\u2019s something the American people simply will not tolerate.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Schumer moderated his comments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see who they nominate,\u201d Schumer told reporters. \u201cIf they\u2019re in the mainstream, we\u2019ll give them a very careful look. If they\u2019re out of the mainstream, we\u2019ll oppose them tooth and nail.\u201d\n\nAsked how he would define mainstream, Schumer replied: \u201cYou know it when you see it.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans blocked Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to replace Scalia for more than nine months.",
