Take it ! \u201d Californians have done just that \u2014 and most of the time their political leaders haven \u2019 t had to worry too much about the result .\nBut in the fourth year of the Golden State \u2019 s epic drought , the water shortage is having real consequences , not only for the everyday lives of residents , but for the policies and political fortunes of their elected officials as well . A crisis that is estimated to have cost the state \u2019 s economy more than $ 2 billion last year alone has upended an unsustainable status quo and raised uncomfortable questions for politicians from Gov . Jerry Brown to local mayors .\nBrown \u2019 s executive order last month ordering mandatory reductions averaging 25 percent for water use in urban areas was widely praised , if almost certainly overdue . But the governor has also been faulted for not asking for comparable conservation from the state \u2019 s vast agribusiness industry , which requires a gallon of water to produce a single almond , more than 20 gallons to grow an ounce of asparagus and more than 100 gallons to raise an ounce of beef . ( In fairness , growers have already had water supplies cut \u2014 in some cases sharply \u2014 by longstanding rules and market forces . )\nFor her part , Dianne Feinstein , the state \u2019 s senior Democratic senator , has struggled to reconcile the views of liberal environmental groups with her longstanding support for growers in the Central Valley , including her billionaire Beverly Hills campaign contributors Stewart and Lynda Resnick , makers of POM Wonderful pomegranate juice and the state \u2019 s largest producers of almonds and pistachios , lucrative orchard crops that can \u2019 t be fallowed to save water in dry years .\nConservatives like Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield , the House majority leader , have seized on the drought to call for relaxation of the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws that he contends keep California from more fully exploiting its biggest in-state source of water , the sprawling Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta . Carly Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and GOP presidential hopeful , has repeatedly called the drought the \u201c man-made \u201d result of excessive environmental regulation \u2014 a claim that The Washington Post \u2019 s \u201c Fact Checker \u201d awarded \u201c Two Pinocchios \u201d for oversimplification .\nAnd Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles has twice ripped up the front lawn of Getty House , his official residence in the Windsor Square neighborhood , to plant a low-water garden of flowering yarrow plants , even as LA Weekly , the city \u2019 s leading alternative newspaper , was reporting last fall that his house had been using 2,100 gallons of water a day \u2014 more than five times as much as the average local home .\n\u201c Politicians are paying attention , because some people \u2014 mainly the media and interest groups \u2014 are paying attention , \u201d said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe , a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California . \u201c But I \u2019 m not at all sure it \u2019 s really hitting home yet with the average voter . When they start to see rate increases , and fines for overuse , and brown lawns , then they will be paying a lot of attention . I think the politicians are smart to be trying to get ahead of it , because this is the new normal . We are a desert , and we should have remained a desert . \u201d\nIndeed , as long ago as 1947 , when Evelyn Waugh published \u201c Death in Hollywood , \u201d an essay about Forest Lawn Cemetery , in Life magazine , he predicted that when archaeologists of a future era descended on Los Angeles they would find \u201c much the same scene as confronted the Franciscan missionaries . \u201d\n\u201c A dry landscape will extend from the ocean to the mountains , \u201d he wrote . \u201c Bel Air and Beverly Hills will lie naked save for scrub and cactus , all their flimsy multitude of architectural styles turned long ago to dust , while the horned toad and the turkey buzzard leave their faint imprint on the dunes that will drift on Sunset Boulevard . \u201d\nConditions here are not that bad \u2014 yet . But it is hard not to believe that California is in the midst of yet another radical transformation in its existence , one that \u2019 s likely to affect the state for decades to come and force a long-lasting reallocation of resources , heightening longstanding tensions between north and south , environmentalists and businesses , farmers and fishermen , and residential and commercial water customers .\nArtificial turf companies have sprung up like crabgrass \u2014 some of them just as disreputable \u2014 spurred by promised consumer rebates of $ 2 to $ 3 a square foot from local water districts to customers who tear out their old water-hogging lawns . Here , too , the rewards and benefits are not necessarily being shared equally . For example , about 60 percent of the money set aside for rebates by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California \u2014 a consortium of cities and districts that provides water to about 17 million people \u2014 has been reserved for commercial users , while 90 percent of the requests for turf removal subsidies have come from residential customers .\nCalifornia \u2019 s water supply has long been controlled by a complex network of federal , state and local authorities . Washington has a powerful role , not only because of environmental laws but also because of its major investment in dams and aqueducts , including Hoover Dam and the Colorado River system , and the massive Central Valley Project , which transports water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers to the state \u2019 s agricultural heartland .\nFeinstein \u2019 s behind-the-scenes attempt to broker a bipartisan bill that would allow temporary flexibility to supply additional water to both urban and rural areas from the delta after big rains , rather than diverting into the ocean , foundered in Congress late last year . Her efforts raised alarm among some environmentalists , who worried that she would bow to agricultural interests , something a longtime adviser told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u201c she has no intention of doing. \u201d Feinstein resumed her work on a bill in the current Congress , and while her spokesman declined to offer a timetable for its unveiling , she is almost certainly serving her last term and could presumably spend the political capital needed to craft a complex compromise .\nLast December , the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill backed by McCarthy and others to authorize temporary measures to maximize water flows from the delta during the drought , even if they exceed certain requirements set by the Endangered Species Act to protect smelt and salmon . The bill was opposed in the Senate by Feinstein and her California colleague , Barbara Boxer , and the Obama administration threatened a veto on the grounds that it contained conflicting mandates and would lead to litigation and uncertainty . But the drive for a temporary easing of the rules is not going away with the GOP now in control of both houses .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been pressure on the part of the constituencies in the San Joaquin Valley to ease up on the Endangered Species Act , \u201d said Ellen Hanak , director of the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California . \u201c An exemption doesn \u2019 t mean overhauling the act as a whole , and therefore it \u2019 s more possible it would happen . \u201d\nBrown also opposed the GOP bill , but he himself was forced last week to scale back the size of the fish and wildlife habitat \u2014 to 30,000 acres from more than 100,000 \u2014 that he proposes to restore in the delta via construction of two giant water tunnels .\nMeantime , not all Californians are suffering equally . Some enclaves in the Central Valley are almost completely without water , having to truck in supplies for showers and cooking , while lush municipalities like Beverly Hills continue to use more than their share and would face reductions of 36 percent under Brown \u2019 s recent order . It will be up to local water authorities to decide how to enforce the cutbacks , through higher rates or fines and penalties for overuse . Brown imposed the mandatory reductions because earlier efforts at voluntary conservation had not produced the needed results , but the evidence so far suggests that hitting his targets will not be easy .\nThe State Water Resources Control Board reported this week that cumulative water savings since last summer have totaled just under 9 percent , while most of the state \u2019 s water suppliers issued only a handful of waste notices in March , despite receiving thousands of complaints .\nSince 1928 , the California State Constitution has had an amendment requiring that all water use in the state be \u201c reasonable and beneficial , \u201d but that has long meant different things to different constituencies . Water rights are complex , and those with so-called \u201c senior rights \u201d get supplies first . In normal years , such users might be expected to sell their reserves to needy growers down the food chain , but now they themselves are experiencing such shortages that they have none left to sell , with the result that some citrus growers are plowing under trees that will take years to replace , simply because they can \u2019 t buy water at a price that makes economic sense .\nRich enclaves like Palm Springs have built sprawling golf courses in the desert , while residents of the Owens Valley , whose water Mulholland diverted to create the modern metropolis of L.A. , have contended with dust and pollution on their once verdant land for decades .\nEnvironmentalists have long believed that farmers get too much water .
