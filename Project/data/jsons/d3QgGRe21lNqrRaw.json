Detectives in Philadelphia , Miami and elsewhere said they are increasingly conducting interviews of suspects , witnesses and victims out in the street and six feet apart , instead of indoors . In Clearwater , Florida , for instance , they \u2019 re often doing so in the parking lot outside of their station .\nAnd when officers do bring people back to the precinct , many have started questioning people from another room , via Zoom or Skype\u2014or at least from the other end of a large conference table .\nThis is frustrating to some police who say they rely on physical proximity to intimidate suspects into telling the truth , or to read their facial expressions and eye contact for clues as to whether they are lying . The fact that masks are now largely required during interrogations , some say , is also obstructing this sort of nonverbal information-gathering .\n\u201c We \u2019 re social animals .

Trying to convince a witness to a traumatizing crime to speak up is clearly more difficult in public than in private.
