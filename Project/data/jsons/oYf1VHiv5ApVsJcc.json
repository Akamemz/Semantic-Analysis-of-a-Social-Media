    "content": "The US Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear two racial gerrymandering cases out of Texas after a federal district court found the state \u2019 s political maps intentionally discriminate against minority voters . This is the third major redistricting case the court will hear this term that has the power to shape political maps across the country .\nThis summer , a three-judge panel in San Antonio found that Texas Republicans intentionally weakened the voting power of African American and Latino voters when it drew multiple state House and congressional districts . This was the ninth racial discrimination in voting case the state has lost since 2011 , which includes a long legal battle over its stringent voter ID requirement . Now , the Supreme Court will determine whether Texas \u2019 maps can stand .\nThe Supreme Court \u2019 s decision to take the case is not surprising . The court \u2019 s conservative majority signaled sympathy with Texas Republicans in September when the five conservatives , including Justice Anthony Kennedy , blocked the lower court \u2019 s order to redraw Texas \u2019 maps until the high court could rule on the case . The four liberal justices dissented from the order . This means Democrats and voting rights advocates will face an uphill battle when the court hears this case .\nAfter Texas created new maps in 2011 , a federal district court in Texas this year found that certain districts in those maps\u2014as well as slightly altered maps adopted in 2013\u2014were drawn in a way that discriminated against Hispanic and African American voters . The court also found that the Republican-controlled legislature intentionally discriminated in creating those districts . The issue of intentionality is important because it allows the courts to place Texas under a process laid out by the 1965 Voting Rights Act called \u201c preclearance , \u201d under which all changes to elections would have to be approved by the federal government . Courts have repeatedly found that Texas sought to undercut the power of minority voters through its political maps , voter ID law , and other election reforms . The state has lost nine racial discrimination cases since 2011 .\nBefore the end of the Supreme Court \u2019 s term this summer , the justices will have weighed in on racial gerrymandering in Texas and partisan gerrymandering in Wisconsin and Maryland .
