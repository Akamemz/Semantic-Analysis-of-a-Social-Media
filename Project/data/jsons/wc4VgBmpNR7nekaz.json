Mary Landrieu , D-La. , turned out to be paid actors . Now in Michigan , they 've found a genuinely sympathetic character -- Leukemia patient Julie Boonstra -- who seems to earnestly dislike the Affordable Care Act . But neither Boonstra nor AFP can quite put their fingers on why she 's worse off under the law than she was before . That 's not to say she should be an Obamacare fan -- who am I to tell her that ? But there 's almost no denying that she 's more protected now than she was before , and probably better off financially as well .\nBoonstra 's central complaint is that she lost her old healthcare plan because of Obamacare , just like an untold number of other individual market patrons .

It turns out that she kept her doctor , and in a separate interview with the Detroit News , acknowledged that her premiums under Obamacare ( $ 571 a month ) are half as much as they were last year ( $ 1,100 ) . Her annual savings -- $ 6,348 -- are actually just $ 2 shy of the Affordable Care Act 's $ 6,350 `` Out of Pocket Maximum '' for an individual plan , above which the insurance company must pay every penny .\nEither she 's unaware of that , or does n't want to admit it , because she told Kessler , `` the premiums are half , but the out\u2011of\u2011pocket costs are so high that , for me , it \u2019 s unaffordable .
