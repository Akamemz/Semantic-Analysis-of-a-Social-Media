Even so , some Muslim American and civil rights leaders said much of Wednesday \u2019 s session of the White House \u2019 s three-day Countering Violent Extremism summit \u2014 which focused on the threat from domestic radicals \u2014 was based on flawed premises .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s summit confirmed that there are significant reasons for concern about [ such ] approaches and that none of the hard questions about protection of civil rights and privacy have yet been answered , \u201d said Hina Shamsi , director of the American Civil Liberties Union \u2019 s national security project . Shamsi , who attended Wednesday \u2019 s proceedings , said that while White House officials had listened to such concerns in private meetings , they were given little airing at the summit .\nWith Americans joining ISIL and Al Qaeda in Syria , and after recent domestic terror attacks in Europe and Canada , the Obama administration is on high alert for terror attacks staged from within . A plan to counter domestic radicalism launched in 2011 under the supervision of Denis McDonough , now Obama \u2019 s chief of staff , aimed to identify possible terrorists before they struck through education about risk factors and greater dialogue and trust between law enforcement and local communities . On Wednesday , Obama touted pilot programs in Boston , Los Angeles and Minneapolis-St. Paul that embody such efforts .\nMany Muslim leaders protest that they are the obvious focus of the initiatives , even if they are described in the generic , non-religious terms that annoy conservatives . And they say the difficult art of discerning emerging terrorists from brooding social misfits is outweighed by the risk of civil liberties violations .\n\u201c Since Sept. 11 , Muslims have been targeted and profiled , and we have created this narrative that we need to \u2018 watch out \u2019 for the Muslim community , \u201d said Jaylani Hussein , executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on Muslim-American Relations .\nIn his remarks on Wednesday , Obama took care to address such anxieties .\n\u201c I know some Muslim Americans have concerns about working with government , particularly law enforcement . And their reluctance is rooted in the objection to certain practices where Muslim Americans feel they \u2019 ve been unfairly targeted , \u201d Obama said .\n\u201c So , in our work , we have to make sure that abuses stop , are not repeated , that we do not stigmatize entire communities . Nobody should be profiled or put under a cloud of suspicion simply because of their faith . Engagement with communities can \u2019 t be a cover for surveillance . \u201d\n\u201c The idea that you \u2019 re tying outreach to terrorist activity is both offensive to the community and specious from a counterterrorism research perspective , \u201d said Mike German of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law .\nThe frustration extends beyond civil liberties advocates and into the Muslim-American communities the Obama administration hopes to reach .\nOne of them is the Minneapolis-St. Paul area , home to a large Muslim immigrant population and the site of one of three counter-radicalism pilot programs featured by the White House during Wednesday \u2019 s program . CAIR \u2019 s Hussein said many Muslims there mistrust government outreach \u2014 especially after recent efforts appeared to be doubling as a means of surveillance .\nAfter 22 Somali-Americans left the area to join the radical Islamic group Al Shabab in Somalia from 2007 to 2009 , the FBI helped the Justice Department expand a longstanding community policing effort with no particular terrorism focus known as the Community Outreach program .\nUnknown to local residents , according to a September 2014 report by the Brennan Center that drew from government documents , that program was funded and run by FBI counterterrorism officials in Washington collecting data on possible radicals .\nThe FBI revised its policies in 2010 to draw a clearer line between outreach and intelligence . \u201c [ M ] embers of the public contacted through a community outreach activity , \u201d one internal memo noted , \u201c generally do not have an expectation that information about them will be maintained in an FBI file or database . \u201d\nThe mistrust lingers within Muslim communities , Hussein said : \u201c People believe that even talking about foreign policy puts you on some kind of watch list . \u201d\nCritics of community outreach programs say little data exists to demonstrate their effectiveness in spotting terrorists . One academic guest at Wednesday \u2019 s summit admitted as much , Shamsi said .\nNor , they argue , is there reason to believe Muslim-American communities are shy about reporting would-be radicals : A 2011 study by a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill sociologist found that \u201c the largest single source of initial information [ about terror plots ] \u2026 involved tips from the Muslim-American community . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not enough , White House homeland security advisor Lisa Monaco recently argued .
