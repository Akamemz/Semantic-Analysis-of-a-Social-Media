That \u2019 s a benchmark that dates back to F.D.R . of course . In his first 100 days F.D.R . pushed 15 major pieces of legislation through Congress . This unprecedented burst of activity established federal insurance of bank deposits and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 regulated Wall Street . It created US agricultural supports and the Civilian Conservation Corps . It laid the foundation for today \u2019 s federal government structure .\nTrump \u2019 s list is neither that sweeping nor , needless to say , that liberal . It includes potentially big changes nonetheless .\nSome aren \u2019 t likely to actually take effect \u2013 for instance , Trump said in October that he \u2019 s going to propose a constitutional amendment to put term limits on Congress . The process to approve that would be lengthy and complex .\nBut others can be done easily . Trump has promised that he \u2019 ll immediately terminate what he terms Obama \u2019 s \u201c illegal amnesties \u201d for unauthorized immigrants . That would include the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which allows unauthorized immigrants brought to the US as kids to stay in the country . He \u2019 s said he \u2019 ll withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal Obama officials have worked on for eight years .\nPresidents have lots of power to levy tariffs on imports of specific products or from particular countries , as Trump has threatened to do . They have plenty of leeway on foreign policy as well . In that regard Trump has vowed that on Day 1 he \u2019 ll go after China by labeling it a currency manipulator \u2013 a move that may have little actual effect but will annoy Beijing . And he insists that at the earliest possible moment the US will begin working on Trump \u2019 s Great Wall for the southern border ( a barrier Obama has called \u201c half-baked \u201d ) .\nThe new president has not changed his position in regard to where the funding for this project is coming from .\n\u201c Mexico will pay for the wall , \u201d insists Trump \u2019 s website still , highlighting the vow in red type .\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/AP President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in November .\nIn some ways obama \u2019 s legacy is uniquely vulnerable to reversal or alteration by a new chief executive . That \u2019 s because a substantial portion of it is built on a foundation of executive orders and other direct manifestations of presidential power .\nObama did not feel he had much choice . In his first two years in office he enjoyed safe congressional majorities , and he was able to get Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill through Congress . But in the 2010 midterm elections Democrats lost control of the House and barely held onto the Senate . After that the route through Capitol Hill for Obama \u2019 s legislative agenda was pretty much blocked .\nSo he turned to executive actions . DACA is a case in point : There was no way Obama could get a bill through Congress allowing unauthorized immigrants brought here as youngsters to stay in the US . Instead , he invoked his authority as the boss of federal law enforcement and ordered US prosecutors to use their discretion to leave such people alone . Republicans fumed ( and sued ) but now that \u2019 s a moot point .\n\u201c The great thing about executive power is that you can use it with efficiency and speed . The bad thing is that the next president can attack it with the same efficiency and speed , \u201d says Mr. Zelizer .\nThe Iran nuclear deal is another example of this approach . It \u2019 s not a treaty approved by the Senate and enacted into US law . Instead , Obama used his presidential authority to lift Iranian sanctions , his ability to strike political international agreements , and the US vote in the United Nations Security Council to stitch together an accord aimed at curbing Iran \u2019 s uranium enrichment activities .\nIranian Presidency Office/AP President Hassan Rouhani ( right , c. ) and other Iranian leaders listen to the national anthem at the University of Tehran . Whether Donald Trump will pull the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran , as he \u2019 s said he wants to , will be a foreign-policy decision watched around the world .\nTrump could reverse much of that . During his campaign he vowed he would , saying that his \u201c No . 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal \u201d and extract more concessions from Tehran . Whether he \u2019 ll fulfill this promise is an open question \u2013 at a recent \u2588\u2588\u2588 breakfast the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee , said ripping up the agreement would create an international \u201c crisis \u201d and isn \u2019 t likely to happen . But Trump \u2019 s unpredictable . The power to act on this issue is in his hands .\nWhoever follows Trump into the Oval Office may have the same sort of leeway on other important matters . Heavy reliance on executive actions has become a feature of the modern presidency , says former Senate historian Donald Ritchie . Given the GOP \u2019 s current hold on the House and Senate , it might be hard to foresee a day when Trump finds the legislative pathway blocked . But disputes can be intraparty as well as partisan . And the American electorate seems to have become used to punishing the party in power in midterm elections .\n\u201c If you look at the last couple of years of every president ... once they lose control of Congress they have got to turn to executive orders if they want to leave a stamp on things , \u201d Mr. Ritchie says .\nFor now , though , the US government is in united Republican hands . And the congressional GOP is more ideologically unified than ever . The party has moved to the right on many overarching domestic issues such as government spending and taxes . The few moderate Capitol Hill Republicans that remain could caucus in the back of a compact car .\nTrump \u2019 s constructed a cabinet along similar lines . Even his picks from outside Washington are generally in concert with the congressional GOP \u2019 s thinking on domestic issues . Some nominees \u2013 such as the secretary-designate of Health and Human Services , Rep. Tom Price \u2013 were plucked from Congress itself .\nIt \u2019 s almost certain that Congress will move a tax cut bill , probably shaped along lines long favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan .\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters Donald Trump introduces his wife , Melania , before delivering his remarks at a luncheon with his cabinet members and congressional leaders at Trump International Hotel in Washington .\nIt \u2019 s also virtually certain that lawmakers will repeal Obamacare and enact some sort of GOP health plan in its place . It \u2019 s likely that they \u2019 ll also try to substantially alter Medicaid and perhaps Medicare .\nTrump continues to talk about an infrastructure bill , but that seems to be dropping on his list of priorities . Transition officials say it is no longer \u201c core \u201d and is likely to be addressed only after the Trump administration \u2019 s initial burst of action .\nOn most of these issues Democrats will be involved only on the margins . The US isn \u2019 t entering an era of bridge building . It \u2019 s continuing a period of partisan divide and rule in government .\nTrump won \u2019 t transform Washington as a Republican who builds a new coalition with Democrats , says Zelizer . \u201c He \u2019 ll transform it as a Republican who might achieve what his Republican predecessors were unable to do in terms of cutting down a lot of government and in some ways using the military more aggressively , \u201d says the Princeton professor .\nBut there is a wild card here , a known unknown , an X-factor . That \u2019 s Donald Trump himself . As president , Trump is singular . Some historians compare him to Andrew Jackson , the first populist president , a man whose supporters the elite felt to be uncouth .\nBut Jackson had been a state governor and a general . Trump \u2019 s the only US chief executive in history who has never held political office or been a military officer . He \u2019 s the first to use social media to attack his adversaries . His blunt campaign style has been unique and refreshing to some , and horrifyingly transgressive to others .\nWhat will he actually do ? That remains an open question . Some of his recent tweets , if serious , have vast policy implications . In December he tweeted that the US \u201c must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability , \u201d for instance . That implies he will propose a large new atomic weapons program , perhaps launching a new arms race . Unless the tweet was just a random musing thought , the kind all presidents probably have but haven \u2019 t previously made public .\nTrump \u2019 s also tweeted that flag burners should face loss of US citizenship or some other sort of legal punishment . That would likely run afoul of First Amendment protections . Is he serious ? He often complains about unfair media treatment and labels particular newspapers or TV programs \u201c failing. \u201d He \u2019 s talked about loosening libel laws . Will he use legal powers to go after the press ?\nThe Trump Cabinet is conservative \u2013 predictably so , says David Greenberg , a professor of history and journalism at Rutgers University . With a few exceptions , its members are the same sort of people any of the Republican presidential candidates would have picked .\nBut Trump has also selected for his inner circle some \u201c wild outsiders \u201d who want to blow up the current political system , says Mr. Greenberg , such as former Breitbart News chair Steve Bannon . In that sense the 2017 transition might be similar to the 1969 handover of power from Lyndon Johnson to Richard Nixon .\nNixon picked a conservative cabinet but generally ignored it and dealt mostly with a favored few aides , such as Chief of Staff H.R . Haldeman . Nixon \u2019 s temperament wasn \u2019 t so much conservative as authoritarian , Greenberg adds . \u201c The worry most people have about Trump is along those lines , \u201d he says . \u201c People worry he will govern the way he has campaigned ... [ that ] he will show the same contempt for norms that he has throughout the campaign . \u201d\nIn that sense the transition from Obama to Trump will involve more than just a change in policies , says the Rutgers historian .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that Trump is less a breaker of Washington \u2019 s crockery and more a rookie politician who hasn \u2019 t yet figured out how to translate his business experience into presidential leadership .\nIf that \u2019 s the case , the best comparison might not be Nixon , but Jimmy Carter . President Carter was an outsider who knew little about how to get things done in the nation \u2019 s capital . To some extent , he never did figure it out . Carter , a former Georgia governor , treated Congress as if it were the Georgia state legislature \u2013 something you could go around via direct appeals to voters . That just did not work on the national level after he won the presidency .\n\u201c He had huge Democratic majorities and didn \u2019 t make the most of [ them ] , \u201d says Ritchie , the former Senate historian .\nThat example would foreshadow friction between Trump and the congressional Republican majority . There have been some examples of that in the pre-inaugural period : Trump objected to the timing of the House GOP effort to downgrade the independent Office of Congressional Ethics . Many Republican lawmakers have questioned Trump \u2019 s developing geopolitical \u201c bromance \u201d with Russian leader Vladimir Putin .\nFor now , the GOP congressional leadership appears willing to accommodate Trump \u2019 s tweets and other eccentricities to get his presidential signature on long-sought conservative legislation . But this accommodation has shallow roots . Remember that back in June Mr. Ryan called Trump \u2019 s complaints about a Hispanic judge a \u201c textbook definition of a racist comment . \u201d\n\u201c Who is going to check [ Trump ] ? It might be his own party in Congress , \u201d says former House historian Raymond Smock , director of the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education .\nShannon Stapleton/Reuters Donald Trump smiles as he is applauded by his son Eric Trump ( l. ) , daughter Ivanka Trump , and son Donald Trump Jr. ( r. ) at a recent press conference at Trump Tower in New York .\nThe US government isn \u2019 t actually a Ford Mustang ( American made ! ) that a new president can whip into a tight slide and turn . It \u2019 s more like a container ship , a behemoth of the seas that has lots of inertia and takes miles to stop . Not exactly maneuverable .\nAll presidents come into office wanting to make an immediate impact . But that is harder than it looks .\n\u201c There is a lot more continuity than people think , \u201d says George Edwards III , a presidential expert and distinguished professor of political science at Texas A & M University .\nFor one thing , the bureaucracy resists . This is a matter of procedure as much as obstinacy . It \u2019 s easy for a new president to sign an executive order undoing a predecessor \u2019 s executive order . But will there be a new regulation replacing an old one ? Does it need to be published in the Federal Register for public comment ? What \u2019 s its effect on the budget ? And so forth .\nFor another , existing laws and/or regulations usually develop constituencies . Take Obamacare . Republicans might want to go back to the era prior to the ACA , but doing so would involve taking health insurance away from millions of Americans . It would mean insurers could again deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions . Whatever its faults , the Obama health effort has moved the goal posts on the issue . Trump and the GOP need to take that into account .\nMike Segar/Reuters/File A website shows the sign-up page for the Affordable Care Act ( \u2018 Obamacare \u2019 ) , something that Mr. Trump wants to repeal immediately .\nCongressional Republicans are struggling with that right now as they try to put together an Obamacare replacement as quickly as possible . \u201c You might make some adjustments , but they \u2019 ll provide health care to those millions of people , \u201d Mr. Edwards predicts .\nNor do American interests in foreign policy change just because the nation held an election . A new president , taking office , often finds that there are good reasons the US has taken the international positions it has . The Iran deal might be a good example of this . If Trump rips it up , what will he do next ? Lots of other nations had a say in its creation and aren \u2019 t eager to return to what existed before . That will greatly lessen US leverage . Meanwhile , Iran will demand changes of its own .\nNorth Korea remains one of the biggest problems facing US diplomacy . Trump has already vowed that North Korean development of an intercontinental ballistic missile \u201c won \u2019 t happen. \u201d But as it happens , China is a huge influence on North Korea . It \u2019 s Pyongyang \u2019 s biggest neighbor and only friend . Will plunging into a trade war with Beijing help the US control Kim Jong-un ?\nFinally , presidential honeymoons are short . Trump is working with congressional majorities , which is good news for him , but he is also not particularly popular with voters for an incoming president , which is bad news . That will lessen his ability to get difficult things through Capitol Hill .\n\u201c Once he does things that really irritate people and there is pushback \u2013 \u2018 here is the guy who wants to make the air dirty \u2019 or \u2018 business leaders say this will be bad for jobs \u2019 \u2013 he is going to be even less popular , \u201d says Edwards .\nAll presidential transitions are uncertain . The new president and the new executive branch team are untested . Other countries ( Russia ? ) may see the transition period as a time to prod and test the US . Others ( Israel ? ) may see it as an opportunity to get on better terms with the American administration . \u201c But this one seems more uncertain . Trump has never held public office and he doesn \u2019 t have a long history of opinions in public policies , \u201d says David Clinton , chair of the political science department at Baylor University .\nStevo Vasiljevic/Reuters STEVO VASILJEVIC/REUTERS Mr. Trump \u2019 s charitable comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 the two men are shown here on a billboard in Montenegro \u2013 continue to stir a row in Washington .\nToday \u2019 s situation might be comparable when Eisenhower took over from Truman in 1953 , according to Mr. Clinton . Eisenhower had vowed during the campaign to go to Korea , then the theater of a shooting war . He hinted there would be a dramatic change in US strategy . He also instituted Project Solarium , a famous discussion in which three groups argued for three different US grand strategies in the developing confrontation with the Soviet Union .\nIn the end , Ike made tweaks in the US approach in these areas , but they were minimal . Containment remained the White House watchword for the cold war . \u201c As it turns out , there wasn \u2019 t as much change as people thought there might be , \u201d says Clinton .\nThat \u2019 s the way it has often been with transitions , he says . New presidents discovered that the US ship of state has so much inertia , and takes so much energy to change course , that it is best to single out priorities and work hardest on those .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

Transition officials say it is no longer \u201ccore\u201d and is likely to be addressed only after the Trump administration\u2019s initial burst of action.\n\nOn most of these issues Democrats will be involved only on the margins. The US isn\u2019t entering an era of bridge building. It\u2019s continuing a period of partisan divide and rule in government.\n\nTrump won\u2019t transform Washington as a Republican who builds a new coalition with Democrats, says Zelizer. \u201cHe\u2019ll transform it as a Republican who might achieve what his Republican predecessors were unable to do in terms of cutting down a lot of government and in some ways using the military more aggressively,\u201d says the Princeton professor.\n\nBut there is a wild card here, a known unknown, an X-factor. That\u2019s Donald Trump himself. As president, Trump is singular. Some historians compare him to Andrew Jackson, the first populist president, a man whose supporters the elite felt to be uncouth.\n\nBut Jackson had been a state governor and a general. Trump\u2019s the only US chief executive in history who has never held political office or been a military officer. He\u2019s the first to use social media to attack his adversaries. His blunt campaign style has been unique and refreshing to some, and horrifyingly transgressive to others.\n\nWhat will he actually do? That remains an open question. Some of his recent tweets, if serious, have vast policy implications. In December he tweeted that the US \u201cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,\u201d for instance. That implies he will propose a large new atomic weapons program, perhaps launching a new arms race. Unless the tweet was just a random musing thought, the kind all presidents probably have but haven\u2019t previously made public.\n\nTrump\u2019s also tweeted that flag burners should face loss of US citizenship or some other sort of legal punishment. That would likely run afoul of First Amendment protections. Is he serious? He often complains about unfair media treatment and labels particular newspapers or TV programs \u201cfailing.\u201d He\u2019s talked about loosening libel laws. Will he use legal powers to go after the press?\n\nThe Trump Cabinet is conservative \u2013 predictably so, says David Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism at Rutgers University. With a few exceptions, its members are the same sort of people any of the Republican presidential candidates would have picked.\n\nBut Trump has also selected for his inner circle some \u201cwild outsiders\u201d who want to blow up the current political system, says Mr. Greenberg, such as former Breitbart News chair Steve Bannon. In that sense the 2017 transition might be similar to the 1969 handover of power from Lyndon Johnson to Richard Nixon.\n\nNixon picked a conservative cabinet but generally ignored it and dealt mostly with a favored few aides, such as Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. Nixon\u2019s temperament wasn\u2019t so much conservative as authoritarian, Greenberg adds. \u201cThe worry most people have about Trump is along those lines,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople worry he will govern the way he has campaigned ... [that] he will show the same contempt for norms that he has throughout the campaign.\u201d\n\nIn that sense the transition from Obama to Trump will involve more than just a change in policies, says the Rutgers historian.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Trump is less a breaker of Washington\u2019s crockery and more a rookie politician who hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to translate his business experience into presidential leadership.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, the best comparison might not be Nixon, but Jimmy Carter. President Carter was an outsider who knew little about how to get things done in the nation\u2019s capital. To some extent, he never did figure it out. Carter, a former Georgia governor, treated Congress as if it were the Georgia state legislature \u2013 something you could go around via direct appeals to voters. That just did not work on the national level after he won the presidency.\n\n\u201cHe had huge Democratic majorities and didn\u2019t make the most of [them],\u201d says Ritchie, the former Senate historian.\n\nThat example would foreshadow friction between Trump and the congressional Republican majority. There have been some examples of that in the pre-inaugural period: Trump objected to the timing of the House GOP effort to downgrade the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. Many Republican lawmakers have questioned Trump\u2019s developing geopolitical \u201cbromance\u201d with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nFor now, the GOP congressional leadership appears willing to accommodate Trump\u2019s tweets and other eccentricities to get his presidential signature on long-sought conservative legislation. But this accommodation has shallow roots. Remember that back in June Mr. Ryan called Trump\u2019s complaints about a Hispanic judge a \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is going to check [Trump]? It might be his own party in Congress,\u201d says former House historian Raymond Smock, director of the Robert C. Byrd Center for Congressional History and Education.\n\nShannon Stapleton/Reuters Donald Trump smiles as he is applauded by his son Eric Trump (l.), daughter Ivanka Trump, and son Donald Trump Jr. (r.) at a recent press conference at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nReality might checkTrump\u2019s policy ambitions, too.\n\nThe US government isn\u2019t actually a Ford Mustang (American made!) that a new president can whip into a tight slide and turn. It\u2019s more like a container ship, a behemoth of the seas that has lots of inertia and takes miles to stop. Not exactly maneuverable.\n\nAll presidents come into office wanting to make an immediate impact. But that is harder than it looks.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more continuity than people think,\u201d says George Edwards III, a presidential expert and distinguished professor of political science at Texas A&M University.\n\nFor one thing, the bureaucracy resists. This is a matter of procedure as much as obstinacy. It\u2019s easy for a new president to sign an executive order undoing a predecessor\u2019s executive order. But will there be a new regulation replacing an old one? Does it need to be published in the Federal Register for public comment? What\u2019s its effect on the budget? And so forth.\n\nFor another, existing laws and/or regulations usually develop constituencies. Take Obamacare. Republicans might want to go back to the era prior to the ACA, but doing so would involve taking health insurance away from millions of Americans. It would mean insurers could again deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions. Whatever its faults, the Obama health effort has moved the goal posts on the issue. Trump and the GOP need to take that into account.\n\nMike Segar/Reuters/File A website shows the sign-up page for the Affordable Care Act (\u2018Obamacare\u2019), something that Mr. Trump wants to repeal immediately.\n\nCongressional Republicans are struggling with that right now as they try to put together an Obamacare replacement as quickly as possible. \u201cYou might make some adjustments, but they\u2019ll provide health care to those millions of people,\u201d Mr. Edwards predicts.\n\nNor do American interests in foreign policy change just because the nation held an election. A new president, taking office, often finds that there are good reasons the US has taken the international positions it has. The Iran deal might be a good example of this. If Trump rips it up, what will he do next? Lots of other nations had a say in its creation and aren\u2019t eager to return to what existed before. That will greatly lessen US leverage. Meanwhile, Iran will demand changes of its own.\n\nNorth Korea remains one of the biggest problems facing US diplomacy. Trump has already vowed that North Korean development of an intercontinental ballistic missile \u201cwon\u2019t happen.\u201d But as it happens, China is a huge influence on North Korea. It\u2019s Pyongyang\u2019s biggest neighbor and only friend. Will plunging into a trade war with Beijing help the US control Kim Jong-un?\n\nFinally, presidential honeymoons are short. Trump is working with congressional majorities, which is good news for him, but he is also not particularly popular with voters for an incoming president, which is bad news. That will lessen his ability to get difficult things through Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cOnce he does things that really irritate people and there is pushback \u2013 \u2018here is the guy who wants to make the air dirty\u2019 or \u2018business leaders say this will be bad for jobs\u2019 \u2013 he is going to be even less popular,\u201d says Edwards.\n\nAll presidential transitions are uncertain. The new president and the new executive branch team are untested. Other countries (Russia?) may see the transition period as a time to prod and test the US. Others (Israel?) may see it as an opportunity to get on better terms with the American administration. \u201cBut this one seems more uncertain. Trump has never held public office and he doesn\u2019t have a long history of opinions in public policies,\u201d says David Clinton, chair of the political science department at Baylor University.\n\nStevo Vasiljevic/Reuters STEVO VASILJEVIC/REUTERS Mr. Trump\u2019s charitable comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 the two men are shown here on a billboard in Montenegro \u2013 continue to stir a row in Washington.\n\nToday\u2019s situation might be comparable when Eisenhower took over from Truman in 1953, according to Mr. Clinton. Eisenhower had vowed during the campaign to go to Korea, then the theater of a shooting war. He hinted there would be a dramatic change in US strategy. He also instituted Project Solarium, a famous discussion in which three groups argued for three different US grand strategies in the developing confrontation with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the end, Ike made tweaks in the US approach in these areas, but they were minimal. Containment remained the White House watchword for the cold war. \u201cAs it turns out, there wasn\u2019t as much change as people thought there might be,\u201d says Clinton.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it has often been with transitions, he says. New presidents discovered that the US ship of state has so much inertia, and takes so much energy to change course, that it is best to single out priorities and work hardest on those.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
