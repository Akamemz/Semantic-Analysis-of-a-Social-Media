As we went to press the next morning , Boris Johnson \u2019 s Conservative Party was heading for a majority of well over 70 , the largest Tory margin since the days of Margaret Thatcher . Labour , meanwhile , was expecting its worst result since the 1930s . Mr Johnson , who diced with the possibility of being one of Britain \u2019 s shortest-serving prime ministers , is now all-powerful .\nThe immediate consequence is that , for the first time since the referendum of 2016 , it is clear that Britain will leave the European Union . By the end of January it will be out\u2014though Brexit will still be far from \u201c done \u201d , as Mr Johnson promises . But the Tories \u2019 triumph also shows something else : that a profound realignment in British politics has taken place .

Blyth Valley , an ex-mining community in the north-east where Tories have for generations been the enemy , fell before midnight . Wrexham , Labour turf for more than 80 years , declared for the Conservatives at 2am . Great Grimsby , a struggling northern port held by Labour since the second world war , was taken soon after . By dawn it was clear that the \u201c red wall \u201d of Labour constituencies , which stretched unbroken from north Wales to Yorkshire , had been demolished .\nMr Johnson was lucky in his opponent .

Some of them switched to the Tories , others to the Brexit Party , but the effect was the same : to deprive Labour of its majority in dozens of seats .\nFive years ago , under David Cameron , the Conservative Party was a broadly liberal outfit , preaching free markets as it embraced gay marriage and environmentalism .
