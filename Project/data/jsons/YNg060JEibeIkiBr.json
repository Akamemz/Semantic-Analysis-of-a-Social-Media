''\nTrump and Schumer -- both flamboyant , media savvy , outspoken , deal-making larger-than-life New York personalities have history . In fact , Schumer is one of the few political figures in Washington who Trump actually knows well , and the billionaire contributed to several of his new rival 's election campaigns .\nSchumer even rode to Trump 's defense when he got embroiled in a primary spat earlier this year with Ted Cruz over `` New York values . '' Schumer ( Brooklyn ) and Trump ( Queens , then Manhattan ) , had common cause against the Texas senator .\nSchumer could never have expected he would be matching wits against Trump in the White House -- but the next stage of their political relationship promises to be one of the most intriguing stories of 2017 .\nGiven their common experience in the New York fishbowl , where business and politics mix , both probably have an idea of what makes the other tick . That alone contrasts with the awkward relationship between President Barack Obama and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell , who lacked a common political language .
