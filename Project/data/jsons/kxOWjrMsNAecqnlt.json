    "content": "Pope Francis is the most Democratic president the papacy has ever seen . He arouses the ire of conservatives and traditionalists , while his more liberal constituency wishes he 'd do more . Maybe that 's why I have so much sympathy for the guy \u2014 because when it comes to his relationships , it 's complicated .\nThe pope just released his first major statement on family of his three-year tenure as leader of the Catholic Church . The paper , released on Friday , is a 263-page call for greater inclusion and tolerance called `` Amoris Laetitia '' \u2014 `` The Joy of Love . '' To some , it reads as a groundbreaking step forward from the Vatican for previously shunned individuals like single parents , couples living together outside of marriage and divorced people . To critics , though , it does n't go far enough , still focusing , as a USA Today headline put it , on `` good news for divorced , but not for gays . ''\nThe document , two years in the making , offers no groundbreaking new proclamations , no official changes in Church policy . It affirms that `` every person regardless of sexual orientation\u2026 be respected in his or her dignity and treated with consideration '' while it also insists that `` There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God \u2019 s plan for marriage and family . '' It lightly acknowledges that `` the upright consciences of spouses who have been generous in transmitting life may lead them , for sufficiently serious reasons , to limit the number of their children '' but does n't come out with any new directives for reproductive rights .\nIt is not an earth-shattering message . It is not a call for sweeping reform . And to the many whose own lives are not affected by what a bunch of men working in an incredibly old and flawed institution say , it 's not a big deal . But it is nevertheless , to those invested in the Catholic Church and the way it conducts itself in the world , a progressive statement . The letter urges that `` Seeing things with the eyes of Christ inspires the Church \u2019 s pastoral care for the faithful who are living together , or are only married civilly , or are divorced and remarried\u2026 . The Church turns with love to those who participate in her life in an imperfect manner\u2026 . The Christian community \u2019 s care of such persons is not to be considered a weakening of its faith and testimony to the indissolubility of marriage . ''\nAnd maybe this does n't have the tone of a Hillary rally , but as an eternally conflicted feminist Catholic woman , I found this a real mic drop : `` I think particularly of the shameful ill-treatment to which women are sometimes subjected , domestic violence and various forms of enslavement which , rather than a show of masculine power , are craven acts of cowardice . The verbal , physical , and sexual violence that women endure in some marriages contradicts the very nature of the conjugal union . I think of the reprehensible genital mutilation of women practiced in some cultures , but also of their lack of equal access to dignified work and roles of decision-making . ''\nAnd this , in its own way , is also pretty rad : `` Young married couples should be encouraged to develop a routine that gives a healthy sense of closeness and stability through shared daily rituals . These could include a morning kiss , an evening blessing , waiting at the door to welcome each other home , taking trips together and sharing household chores\u2026 . As long as we can celebrate , we are able to rekindle our love , to free it from monotony and to color our daily routine with hope . '' Run and tell that , pontiff .\nNaturally , Chill Pope 's crazy notions that `` A pastor can not feel that it is enough to simply apply moral laws to those living in '' and advice that `` Each country or region can seek solutions better suited to its culture and sensitive to its traditions and local needs '' has critics fuming . Catholic marriage counselor and writer Rose Sweet told the Washington Post Friday that `` We \u2019 re dealing with very immature , uninformed people who want Papa Francisco to give them what they want . '' And it 's not hard to find FOX News comments fretting that `` He 's taking the foundation of stone that Christianity is built upon and replacing it with sand because he thinks it 's the thing of the day . ''\nMeanwhile , the sentiments of more liberal Catholics can be summed up with the observation of Catholicism scholar Lucetta Scaraffia , who told the New York Times , `` It wasn \u2019 t as innovative as many had hoped . The result is quite modest with respect to the investment and expectations that the world had . '' Ca n't please everybody . Possibly ca n't please anybody . Well , if that does n't does like every Democratic president , governor , or mayor I 've ever lived under , I do n't know what does .\nRunning a large institution \u2014 a country , a city , a church \u2014 is always mired in the politics of compromise . It 's always going to be a game of appeasement . Do I want so much more for women and LGBT persons ? Do I want their rights to live and love in safety and dignity recognized ? Oh , you bet . And I 'm going to keep pushing for that . But I 'm also psyched to have someone in a position of leadership who is n't actively scary , who is n't trying to undo the gains made and turn back the clock . And like Francis , I 'm trying to have hope , even in something that continues to chug along , as he 'd say , in an imperfect manner .",
