It 's become a test of wills between two of the world 's most powerful men , each of whom has political interests that are more likely to deepen the conflict than to quickly ease it .\nBoth view themselves as strongmen . Both have imposed their power on their domestic governing systems by force of will . Both have the authority to trigger global shock waves -- as they did when markets plunged following Trump 's tariff hikes last week and China 's multi-billion dollar retaliation on Monday .\nBoth see the honor of their nation at stake at a crucial moment in the history of US-China relations , as the emerging competition between two great powers becomes sharper than ever .\nWhile Trump has said the two sides were on the verge of a deal last week before China backed out , the gulf in intention between the two giant economies will complicate future talks .\nTrump -- lambasting Chinese intellectual property theft and support for state industries -- believes he has to change the global trading system itself because it is a massive ripoff for the United States .\nAnd Trump thinks the strength of the US economy gives him an edge and the ability to pin the blame for the impasse on Xi .\n`` We are now a much bigger economy than China , and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election . We are the 'piggy bank ' that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of . NO MORE ! '' Trump said Tuesday in an early morning volley of tweets about the trade faceoff .\nXi sees US demands as an infringement on Chinese sovereignty and has an incentive to keep globalization intact since China has profited handsomely from the status quo in a stunning 20-year growth explosion .\nThe Chinese leader is no keener to climb down than Trump .\n`` China feels it does not have to give in , '' Max Baucus , a former US ambassador to China told CNN 's Kate Bolduan on Monday .\n`` Add to that , saving face is a big deal in China . President Xi Jinping does not want to appear to have backed down . I do n't think Americans understand that , '' the former Montana senator said .\nWhile Trump said Monday he will talk to Xi at the G20 summit in Japan in late June -- which is now looming as a massively consequential meeting -- the gaps may be too wide to bridge by then .\nJUST WATCHED Dow dives as markets react to Trump 's trade war with China Replay More Videos ...
