    "content": "People are explaining the San Bernardino massacre in different ways . Some people say it is about gun laws . Others say it is about Islamic terrorism or mental health . Whatever the case , one thing is clear : Everyone , conservatives and liberals alike , grieved for the victims . No one wants such a thing to happen again .\nSadly , it \u2019 s only a matter of time before the United States suffers another mass shooting . For now , the country just can \u2019 t agree on a policy to address such shootings . And if you want to understand why , take a careful look at the image that accompanies this article .\nThe image was created in the hours after San Bernardino by data scientists at a company called Betaworks in New York City . It is composed of a series of dots , or nodes , that represent different accounts on the social media site Twitter ( TWTR ) . Most importantly , it shows how news and comments about the shooting spread among three clusters of users , labeled here as \u201c Second Amendment Defenders \u201d ( the blue dots ) , \u201c Firearms and Hunting \u201d ( the purple dots ) and \u201c Gun Safety Advocates \u201d ( the red dots ) .\nThe image shows how there was an intense burst of activity among the respective clusters as people spread news of the shooting within their \u201c social graph , \u201d a term that describes the chain of relationships in any social media system . And within each cluster , there were some nodes that act as information super-vectors . Betaworks identified the most significant , in terms of each group , as Trident Arms ( @ Trident_Arms ) , Conceal & CarryNetwork ( @ ConcealnNCarrynt ) and Brady Campaign ( @ Bradybuzz ) .\nAs you can see , each of the three groups shared information internally . Two of the groups\u2014the purple and blue ones\u2014passed news between their respective networks but shared almost zero with those in the red group .
