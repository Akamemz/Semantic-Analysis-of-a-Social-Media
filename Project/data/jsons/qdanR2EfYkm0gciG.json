    "content": "Sixty years after Brown v. Board of Education said separate schools for children of color were unacceptable , the same deep-seated inequalities that drove parents to the courtroom in 1954 haunt classrooms across the country .\nSaturday marks the anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling that spawned hundreds of federal desegregation orders \u2014 largely the result of parent lawsuits \u2014 that forced integration in schools one district at a time . But the will to enforce these edicts zigzagged depending on who occupied the White House . Some presidents pushed integration while others stopped it in its tracks .\nThe Obama administration has revived a federal interest in desegregation issues . In a few places , it has managed to leverage the court orders or federal agreements to fight inequities that otherwise would be hard to remedy \u2014 though plenty would fault the Obama White House for not doing enough to fight resegregation and the lack of opportunity afforded to many students . The federal government can intervene in districts with court orders so long as it can prove that minority children are at a disadvantage . Building a case is much harder in other places .\nThose relics have been invoked to integrate a mostly white charter school in South Carolina , reintroduce a banned Mexican-American studies curriculum in Arizona and keep black students in Mississippi from being jailed for acting out at school .\nThe first step to enforcing a federal desegregation order is knowing it exists .\nEveryone seems to have a different explanation about how the feds lost track of hundreds of legal pacts : Some say many documents were destroyed when an attorney \u2019 s office caught fire decades ago . Others point to the passage of time , saying new generations of school district administrators and federal lawyers simply don \u2019 t remember dusty old orders \u2014 especially those rendered meaningless because a district has become too racially lopsided to integrate .\nToday , the Education and Justice departments don \u2019 t actively track all of the orders . But the Obama administration is trying to fix that .\nThe Education Department began asking districts for the first time in 2009 to report whether they are under a desegregation order or plan .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t even have records , \u201d said Russlynn Ali , the Education Department \u2019 s assistant secretary for civil rights in Obama \u2019 s first term .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of the department \u2019 s data shows that more than 1,250 school districts answered yes when asked if they are under a desegregation order or plan . The Education Department could not confirm that information , however , and civil rights experts questioned it . A Department of Justice list of about 200 federal court orders \u2014 each of which can include multiple school districts \u2014 requested by \u2588\u2588\u2588 took weeks to produce .\nPushing school integration can be politically perilous : It inevitably riles parents , school districts and local officials .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t think of any administration that was in love with school desegregation efforts , \u201d said Columbia Law School Professor Ted Shaw , who worked as a trial attorney at the Justice Department during the Carter and Reagan administrations .\nThe Nixon and Carter administrations were aggressive in enforcing the orders in the years after the 1964 Civil Rights Act . Nixon even put together a task force , spearheaded by Labor Secretary George Shultz , to integrate states that had taken few steps to integrate schools after Brown , including several in the Deep South .\nIn the fall of 1981 , a deputy assistant attorney general wrote a memo claiming that black students are \u201c on average \u201d more disruptive in the classroom and \u201c would benefit \u201d from programs for emotionally disturbed students , which alarmed many career lawyers at DOJ . More than a hundred of them wrote a letter protesting administration decisions that included extending tax-exempt status to racially discriminatory private schools .\n\u201c Many of these schools were established for the purpose of perpetuating racial segregation in communities which were in the process of desegregating their schools , \u201d the letter said . \u201c Their existence demonstrates approval , if not encouragement , of racial prejudice . \u201d\nSome lawyers at the Justice Department , including Columbia professor Shaw , eventually resigned . At the same time , a crop of lawyers bound to become leading conservative voices on civil rights issues were cutting their teeth in the same agency including the conservative Goldwater Institute \u2019 s Clint Bolick and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts .\nBolick and Roberts have since gone on to argue for race-neutral policies and against affirmative action . And Roberts has since written majority opinions in Supreme Court cases that steered desegregation law such as a 2007 case that struck down voluntary desegregation plans in Seattle and Louisville , Kentucky .\nIn the early 1990s , a series of Supreme Court decisions made it easier for districts to shake off federal desegregation orders . Hundreds would do so in the coming decades .\nStanford University researchers studying midsize and large districts found that during the Clinton administration , 70 districts were released from federal court supervision . The George W. Bush administration doubled that pace , releasing 140 such districts .\nDuring Bush \u2019 s presidency , the Justice Department encouraged school districts to seek unitary status , said Dennis Parker , director of the American Civil Liberties Union \u2019 s Racial Justice Program . \u201c They were literally writing letters to school districts inviting them to apply , \u201d he said .\nIn the first year of the Obama administration \u2014 the only year with equivalent data \u2014 10 districts were declared unitary , compared with an average 22 per year during the Bush administration . Unitary status means a judge says the district did away with a dual system of education and is free from most federal oversight .\nBy the time President Barack Obama got to office , there were far fewer resources for enforcing the remaining court orders , said Shaw , who worked on the transition team for the Department of Justice at the time .\nToday , the Justice Department counts at least 43 school desegregation interventions during Obama \u2019 s first term .\n\u201c DOJ has recently used some of these existing desegregation orders to go after what you might call second- or third-generation racial segregation , \u201d said Jim Eichner , managing director of the civil rights group the Advancement Project and a former attorney at the Education Department \u2019 s Office for Civil Rights .\nThat was the case in Meridian , Mississippi , where a federal order says black students were being punished more severely than white students , \u201c even where the students were at the same school , were of similar ages and had similar disciplinary histories. \u201d DOJ cited the district \u2019 s 1965 federal desegregation order as its grounds to get involved .\nToo often , the district was calling the police to handle minor incidents \u2014 spitballs , talking back to teachers , slapping classmates \u2014 said Randle Jennings , education chairman for the Meridian/Lauderdale County branch of the NAACP . Black students , especially young men , were amassing criminal records .\nThe district signed an agreement with DOJ pledging to stop calling the police every time students misbehaved .\nThe Justice Department also very loudly invoked desegregation orders to intervene in a private school voucher program in Louisiana .\nAnd the Tucson , Arizona , school district created a Mexican-American studies curriculum years ago to target low achievement and high dropout rates among Latino students , who make up more than half of the student body . But anti-immigration sentiment in the state led to a 2010 state law that targeted Tucson \u2019 s curriculum .\nTucson continued teaching the courses until state education leaders ordered the district to stop its use and threatened to withhold state funding if the courses continued .\nThe district brought back Mexican-American studies last year as part of an agreement with DOJ as one step to getting out from under the court order .\nThe desegregation order has been a \u201c powerful tool \u201d in Tucson , said Thomas Saenz , president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund : Without the federal involvement over desegregation in Tucson , it would have been nearly impossible to reinstate Mexican-American studies .\nNearly 2,000 miles away , Beaufort County , South Carolina , is home to the lush golf courses of mostly white , retiree-filled Hilton Head on one side , and the largely black rural communities north of the Broad River on the other . When the district opened Riverview Charter School in 2009 , it was nearly all white . The committee that created the school was nearly all white , too .\n\u201c It did not even come close to meeting the standards of the [ U.S. Education Department \u2019 s ] Office for Civil Rights , \u201d county School Board Chairman Bill Evans said .\nThe federal government was able to swoop in thanks to Beaufort County \u2019 s 1970 Plan to Eliminate the Dual School System .\nThe changes were dramatic : During the school \u2019 s first year , the school was 72 percent white , 14 percent black and 5 percent Latino . This year , the enrollment is 58 percent white , 22 percent black and 9 percent Latino .\nEighth-grade classes are mostly full of white students . But the younger classrooms are far more diverse .\nYou can see the change , Evans said , as you walk from one end of the school to the other .",
