''\nIt was vintage Obama , blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders .\nThere were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code , spend more to rebuild roads and bridges , bolster education and avoid war if at all possible .\nHe brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt . First Class Cory Remsburg , a disabled war veteran who sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation .\nEven Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill .\n`` A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex , '' said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos . `` The worst there ever was is still excellent . ''\nAccording to a snap CNN/ORC International poll , 44 % of respondents had a `` very positive '' response to Obama 's speech , while 32 % described a `` somewhat positive '' response and 22 % did n't like it at all . Last year , 53 % of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive .\nThe underlying theme of Obama 's fifth State of the Union address was his call on Tuesday for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014 , and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year .\n`` Let 's make this a year of action , '' Obama said . `` That 's what most Americans want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations . ''\nIt 's an optimistic goal for a President with a 43 % approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the Republican-led House of Representatives with congressional elections looming in November .\n`` What I offer tonight is a set of concrete , practical proposals to speed up growth , strengthen the middle class , and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class , '' Obama said . `` Some require congressional action , and I 'm eager to work with all of you .

The first 40 were plenty . ... We all owe it to the American people to say what we 're for , not just what we 're against . ''\nIn her response , though , McMorris Rodgers continued the GOP attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment .\nThe CNN/ORC poll indicated 59 % of respondents thought Obama 's policies as presented in the speech would help the economy , a lower figure than in recent years .\nObama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA , a savings bond that would guarantee `` a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in .

''\n-- Equal pay for women , noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns , which he called `` wrong '' and `` an embarrassment '' to prompt loud and long applause .\n-- Setting new fuel standards for American trucks to help reduce U.S. oil imports `` and what we pay at the pump . ''\n-- Reworking the corporate tax code . He urged Congress to work with him to close `` wasteful , complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here '' and instead `` lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home . ''\n-- Congress to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay so the prison cna be closed in 2014 .\nObama also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from Congress that would derail talks on preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon , adding that `` for the sake of our national security , we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed . ''\nEven as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits , Obama said average wages have been flat . Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts , Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $ 10.10 per hour .\nRepublicans largely oppose any federal increase , saying it will place a burden on employers .\n`` This is definitely the President 's agenda and has been for some time now , '' said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley , who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore , it was hard to see big things happening in 2014 .",
