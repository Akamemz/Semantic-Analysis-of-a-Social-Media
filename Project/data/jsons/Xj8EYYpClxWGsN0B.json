    "content": "Donald Trump has never been known primarily as a man of faith . But in his first appearance Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast , President Trump reaffirmed that he will be a strong advocate for the priorities of conservative Christians \u2013 a key part of his political base .\nThe first days of Trump \u2019 s presidency have been marked by a series of actions demonstrating that commitment . And on Thursday , he added another : a pledge to overturn a law that forbids political speech by tax-exempt churches .\n\u201c I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment , and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution , \u201d Trump said , referring to a 1954 measure that bars churches from endorsing and opposing political candidates . Congress would have to approve a repeal .\nTrump had made such a pledge during the campaign , but his reference Thursday added new urgency to that goal . And it builds on an already-robust record of advocacy for the priorities of religious conservatives :\n\u2022 The Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch , a strong social conservative . Judge Gorsuch has never ruled in an abortion case , but he has sided with religious conservatives in key cases and wrote a book opposing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia .\n\u2022 The appearance by Trump \u2019 s vice president , Mike Pence , and a top adviser , Kellyanne Conway , at last week \u2019 s annual antiabortion march . Vice President Pence was the highest-level government official ever to appear in person at the March for Life .\n\u2022 The reinstatement , by executive order , of a US government ban on funding for international groups that provide abortion counseling .\n\u2022 Agreement , in a TV interview , that \u201c persecuted Christians \u201d would be given priority as refugees .\nTrump is also reportedly considering an executive order titled \u201c Establishing a Government-Wide Initiative to Respect Religious Freedom. \u201d Such a move would reassure religious conservatives , though critics say it could curtail the rights of gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people .\n\u201c Evangelicals are particularly important to Trump , \u201d says John Green , an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio . \u201c On two issues \u2013 abortion and the Supreme Court \u2013 he made some pretty strong promises during the campaign , and at least so far he has kept them . \u201d\nThe irony is lost on no one . Trump \u2019 s personal background \u2013 a thrice-married , casino-owning billionaire who at times has spoken of women in crude terms \u2013 does not suggest a pious man . Trump himself referred to his past at the Republican National Convention last summer . He thanked \u201c the evangelical and religious community \u201d for its support on his way to the GOP nomination , then added : \u201c I \u2019 m not sure I totally deserve it . \u201d\nAs a crucial part of the Republican coalition , white evangelicals delivered for Trump on Election Day . They made up between 35 and 40 percent of the Republican vote , according to exit polls . All told , Trump won 80 percent of the white evangelical vote \u2013 the highest percentage for a Republican presidential nominee since 2004 .\n\u201c During the campaign some polls seemed to show there would be a falloff in the [ evangelical ] vote for Trump , \u201d says James Guth , an expert on religion and politics at Furman University in Greenville , S.C. \u201c But when it came to Election Day , they fell in line . \u201d\nDislike of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , and her strong support for abortion and gay rights , also helped . But evangelical voters could have just stayed home .
