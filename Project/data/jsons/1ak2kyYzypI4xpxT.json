So here's a recap for all those trying to keep track of the flurry of last-minute legal activity involving state voting laws:\n\nArkansas: The Arkansas Supreme Court has struck down the state's voter ID law. A county circuit court judge found the law unconstitutional in May but stayed his decision pending appeal. That meant that the ID law would have been in effect for the November elections. Now it won't be. The state's high court found that requiring voters to show a photo ID imposed a new qualification for voting, violating the state's constitution.\n\nOhio: The U.S. Supreme Court voted 5-4 to block a lower court ruling that would have prevented the state from cutting back its early-voting period. That means that instead of starting early voting on Sept. 30, Ohio voters had to wait a week. The decision also cut out early voting during evening hours and on Sunday, Oct. 26. However, there will still be early voting in Ohio on the weekend right before Election Day. Opponents said the early-voting cuts would hurt minority voters the most. The state countered that Ohio still offers more early voting than other states.\n\nNorth Carolina: The U.S. Supreme Court stayed a federal appeals court decision to block part of the state's sweeping new voting law.

So, at least for now, Wisconsin voters do not have to show a photo ID at the polls. Three justices dissented \u2014 Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Even so, Alito expressed concern about imposing the new ID requirement \u2014 which had been on hold \u2014 so close to the election. He said it was \"troubling\" that the state sent out thousands of absentee ballots without the ID requirement. Those ballots were at risk of being rejected but will now be counted.\n\nTexas: Civil rights groups have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the state's new voter ID law \u2014 one of the strictest in the nation \u2014 from remaining in effect this year, while the law is being challenged.
