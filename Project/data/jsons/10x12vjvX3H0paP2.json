The issue has dominated the U.S. political conversation during the week since gunmen and suicide bombers terrorized Paris on a Friday night .\nAll Republican presidential candidates called on President Barack Obama to renege on his pledge to admit 10,000 refugees fleeing Syria 's brutal civil war into the U.S. and argued instead for a full stop , fearing terrorists could infiltrate their ranks .\nThirty-one governors have declared Syrian refugees unwelcome in their states and on Thursday the House passed a bill to bar refugees from Syria and Iraq from entering the U.S. Nearly 50 Democrats joined 242 Republicans to pass the bill , which the White House has threatened to veto . Sen. Ted Cruz , a Republican presidential candidate , suggested the U.S. only accept Christian refugees . Ben Carson , another candidate , likened refugees to `` rabid dogs '' threatening the neighborhood .\nBut those responses ignore one very important fact : the refugee program is quite simply the toughest way for a foreigner to legally enter the United States . There are other security gaps that would be easier for would-be terrorists to exploit .\nAs of now , none of the Paris attackers have been confirmed as having entered Europe as refugees .\nIn fact , most of the Paris attackers were European citizens born in France or Belgium . Two of them appear to have entered Europe through Greece although it does n't appear that they came in through a refugee program .\nA Syrian passport found next to one of the attackers ' bodies stoked fears that the man had been a refugee . That has not yet been confirmed , although top European officials have suggested the passport was doctored , which raises its own set of questions , but does not confirm the suspected attacker was a refugee . Others have definitively been shown to be European citizens\nPerhaps more importantly , the European refugee admission system is dramatically different from the U.S. system for Syrians , in large part because the U.S. is geographically separated from Syria .

It 's a process Mark Toner , a State Department spokesman , recently called `` the most stringent security process for anyone entering the United States . ''\nAnd Syrian refugees get an additional , more targeted layer of screening involving the U.S. Intelligence agency , according to a government official .\nSounds pretty rigorous .
