It would be impossible to destroy the entire stockpile instantly , but that task must be done with care and speed because those weapons can not be allowed to fall into other murderous hands in the conflict .\nMr. Obama , who is expected to speak to the nation on Tuesday night , spent the past week making the case for a limited strike , but he has won little support for his plan internationally , in Congress or with the American public .\nThe diplomatic proposal creates at least a pause in the action . It could mean that the United States would not have to go it alone in standing firm against the Syrian regime . And it could open up a broader channel to a political settlement between Mr. Assad and the rebels \u2014 the only practical way to end this war .
