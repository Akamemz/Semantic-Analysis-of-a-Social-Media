On June 22 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that The Washington Post espoused this same liberal talking point , claiming that the Supreme Court created an individual right to keep and bear arms via the District of Columbia v. Heller ( 2008 ) decision .\nIn other words , prior to 2008 , there was no individual right to keep and bear arms . It wasn \u2019 t what our Founding Fathers intended and it wasn \u2019 t what generation upon generation of Americans from 1791 to 2008 believed and lived by . It \u2019 s all based on a decision by a group of justices .\nWe have a long tradition of gun rights and gun ownership in this country . The Second Amendment has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean the people have the right to bear arms . There are a lot of law-abiding , responsible gun owners who use it for protection or sport . They handle their weapons properly . There are traditions of families passing down [ hunting ] from father to son , or daughter \u2026 and that is important ; that \u2019 s part of who we are . But what we also have to recognize is , is that our homicide rates are so much higher than other industrialized nations\u2013by like a mile . And most of that is attributable to the easy , ready , availability of firearms , particularly handguns .\nHowever , the gun control lobby \u2019 s relentless claim that America \u2019 s homicide rate is so much higher than other industrialized countries breaks down under scrutiny .\nFor example , in August 2013 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported on a study in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy which showed that the murder rate in heavily gun-controlled Russia was approximately 20.52 per 100,000 people in 2002 . A high point for America was 6.6 per 100,000 people in 1993 , and that rate fell to 3.2 per 100,000 by 2011 , after the number of privately owned guns in America went from 192 million in 1994 to 310 million in 2009 .\nSo , 20.52 per 100,000 people are murdered in Russia versus America \u2019 s 6.6 per 100,000\u2013later to be 3.2 per 100,000\u2013yet , according to President Obama , America \u2019 s murder rate is , \u201c like a mile \u201d higher than that of other industrialized countries .",
