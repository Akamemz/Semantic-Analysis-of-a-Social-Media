    "content_original": "(CNN) President Donald Trump ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller last June, only to be talked out of doing so when White House general counsel Don McGahn refused to follow through because he disagreed with the President's reasoning, a source told CNN Thursday night .\n\nThat's a wow.\n\nEspecially because time and time again over the past year, Trump -- and his senior advisers -- have insisted that he had never, ever, never, not once considered anything like firing Mueller.\n\n\"I haven't given it any thought,\" Trump replied in August -- two months after he reportedly ordered Mueller fired --- to a question from a reporter as to whether he had considered firing the special counsel.\n\nSo, besides the fact that Trump -- contrary to his public assertions -- not only thought about firing Mueller but asked that it be done, what else does The New York Times story teach us (or remind us) about Trump?\n\n1. Trump has a tin ear\n\nRemember the timeline here. Trump fires then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. That same month -- May 17 to be exact -- Mueller is appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and tasked with overseeing the investigation into Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign.\n\nIt's right around that time that Trump ordered the firing of Mueller. McGahn objected because, according to the Times : \"McGahn disagreed with the President's case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on Mr. Trump's presidency.\"\n\nWhich is, of course, 100% right. And yet, somehow, Trump, the self-proclaimed political genius of our time, wasn't able to grasp the effect that firing Mueller might have on his presidency.\n\n2. Trump is paranoid\n\nThis isn't something we learned from the Times story, but something the story should remind us all.\n\nThe reasons that Trump believed Mueller should be fired, according to the Times, were: a) Mueller carried a grudge over membership fees at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia.

Mueller would risk his entire career and reputation solely to get back at Trump for golf dues?\n\nOn its face it's laughable. And yet, Trump believed it.\n\n3. Trump can be talked down\n\nThere's a tendency to assume that once Trump makes his mind up about something -- or someone -- that's the final word. The Mueller episode suggests that's not true.\n\nMcGahn essentially called Trump's bluff on Mueller. As a lawyer, he thought it was a bad idea that would create many more problems than it would be worth. You want him fired, do it yourself, McGahn dared Trump. \"Mr. McGahn also told White House officials that Mr. Trump would not follow through on the dismissal on his own,\" reads the Times report. \"The President then backed off.\"\n\nThat's instructive.
