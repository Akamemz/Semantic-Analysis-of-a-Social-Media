''\nHowever , Arizona Sen. John McCain , the expected incoming chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said on local Arizona radio station KFYI 550 's `` The Mike Broomhead Show '' that he spoke with Hagel last week and the Defense secretary was `` frustrated . ''\n`` They 're gon na say well it was time for a change and all that ... but I can tell you he was in my office last week , he was very frustrated , '' McCain said , with a lack of strategy to combat ISIS , help the Ukranians and what McCain called `` a lack of U.S. influence ... unknown in history . ''\nMcCain said , despite the fact `` White House people are leaking , 'Well , he was n't up to the job , ' believe me , he was up to the job '' \u2014 and that the real issue was the White House itself .\n`` It was the job that he was given where he really was never really brought into that real tight circle inside the White House that makes all the decisions , '' he said .\nThroughout the day Monday , administration officials continued to insist the decision for Hagel to step down was mutual and had nothing to do with his feelings on the administration 's defense strategy .\nPentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour that `` the secretary 's decision to resign has nothing to do with Iraq policy or strategy . ''\n`` He 's very much a strong advocate for the policy and the strategy that we 're executing there , '' he said .\nHe added that Hagel 's resignation does n't hint at any `` major changes '' to the nation 's strategy in Iraq , including the president 's decision not to put boots on the ground there in a combat role .\nBehind the scenes , administration officials told CNN there were a series of discussions over the past several weeks with the President , initiated by Hagel . The talks covered a `` broader discussion of national security for the next two years , '' a defense official said .\nThe two came to realize that `` a different focus was needed and a change is in order , '' the official added . `` It is wrong to conclude that this was a protest by Hagel or it was over policy differences .
