Oh , they backtracked a little when the extent of their killing fantasies got exposed , scampering like their insect analogy , the roach , when someone flips on the kitchen light . But that kid in DC with the Frigidaireborne reefer ranger banging that drum in his baffled mug ? They wanted that kid to die for having a Wrong Smile .\nCue the excuse chorus : \u201c That \u2019 s nonsense ! We just wanted to pummel that kid and then destroy him , his family and and all his classmates ! Don \u2019 t look behind the curtain at the woodchipper comments and bomb threats , you cisnormative monsters ! \u201d\nAccept that that kid was you , and me . If they \u2019 ll ice a kid for not having the right grin , they \u2019 ll waste you or me in a heartbeat . Murder is , after all , how leftists roll . The USSR , Red China , Cambodia , North Korea , Cuba \u2013 that cadaver-strewn litany teaches what \u2019 s lurking at the bottom of the slope we \u2019 re sliding down . The Dems are spooning with socialism , and the goal of socialism is written in blood on the pages of history . The unapproved must be liquidated , and they are making no secret that you are unapproved .\nI know it \u2019 s hard . It goes against everything you \u2019 ve been taught to believe to acknowledge that that a significant and influential group of other Americans \u2013 not that they identify that way \u2013 want you dead or enslaved . But they do . The Fredocons will scoff , but the conservaquisling collaborators \u2019 actions speak louder than their weasel words \u2013 they \u2019 re currying favor with the enemy , betting that their abject groveling and supine submission will mean that they get the chop last .\nYou better get your head in the game or you \u2019 ll find your head in a guillotine \u2013 definitely figuratively , maybe literally .\nYou want to reject this reality , to dismiss it , to wave it off as crazy talk . But listen to what they say . Watch what they do . Have the strength to accept the harsh truth that is punching you in the face .\nThey hate you for not submitting , for being an obstacle to their rule .\nThe problem is that you are nice , and you project your niceness . Projection is human nature . So while leftist spittle-spewing sociopaths project their own shriveled morality when they shriek about how we \u2019 re all racist fascists of fascist racism when racist fascism is actually their jam , we Normals tend to project our decency when we assume that our opponents are just confused friends who are in the throes of a grievous misunderstanding about us that we can remedy with facts and evidence .\nThat \u2019 s 100 percent wrong . Facts and evidence don \u2019 t matter because the trial is already over and you \u2019 ve already been condemned because of who you are . You can \u2019 t ever clear yourself with the left because they don \u2019 t hate you for what you did or will do , but for who you are . That \u2019 s where the babble about \u201c white privilege \u201d comes from \u2013 if you \u2019 re white and conservative you \u2019 re wrong , and if you \u2019 re not white and conservative , you \u2019 re even\u2026wronger .\nIt \u2019 s not about race or gender or orientation , but about power \u2013 they want to take yours , to strip you of your sovereignty and make you kneel . Their SJW posturing is all a lie and a scam . They don \u2019 t care about ending racism , sexism , homophobia , or any of the myriad other -isms and -phobias they blather about . Those poses are just weapons to be used to capture what they really want \u2013 total power over you . They seek to shame you into submission , and if that won \u2019 t work , then they \u2019 ll do whatever it takes .\nDo you think the Democrats of yesterday spent a lot of time weighing the evidence before lynching black men ? Those Democrats murdered black men for two reasons \u2013 because they wanted to send a message to other black men about the price of resistance , and because they enjoyed doing it .\nWhen the Democrats of today were on Twitter mobbing those children from Kentucky for daring not to submit , couldn \u2019 t you sense the hideous joy they felt screeching for the heads of those kids ?
