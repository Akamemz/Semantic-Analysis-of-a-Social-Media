    "content": "After a student protest at Vermont 's Middlebury College managed to shut down an event last week featuring conservative writer Charles Murray , a liberal professor who had agreed to engage Murray onstage described the `` hatred '' unleashed upon her by protesting students , how she feared for her life \u2014 and that the incident is `` a metaphor for what is wrong with our country . ''\nAllison Stanger , a Middlebury political science professor and a known Democrat , wrote on Facebook days later that she viewed her appearance with Murray \u2014 author of `` The Bell Curve '' \u2014 as `` a chance to demonstrate publicly my commitment to a free and fair exchange of views in my classroom . ''\nThat apparently is more than can be said for some of her faculty colleagues , whom Stanger revealed had already judged `` Murray \u2019 s work and character '' before the event `` while openly admitting that they had not read anything he had written . ''\nStanger went on to describe what she witnessed from the stage Thursday :\nI want you to know what it feels like to look out at a sea of students yelling obscenities at other members of my beloved community . There were students and faculty who wanted to hear the exchange , but were unable to do so , either because of the screaming and chanting and chair-pounding in the room , or because their seats were occupied by those who refused to listen , and they were stranded outside the doors . I saw some of my faculty colleagues who had publicly acknowledged that they had not read anything Dr. Murray had written join the effort to shut down the lecture . All of this was deeply unsettling to me . What alarmed me most , however , was what I saw in student eyes from up on that stage . Those who wanted the event to take place made eye contact with me . Those intent on disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so . It was clear to me that they had effectively dehumanized me . They couldn \u2019 t look me in the eye , because if they had , they would have seen another human being . There is a lot to be angry about in America today , but nothing good ever comes from demonizing our brothers and sisters .\nStanger and Murray eventually exited the venue and livestreamed their Q & A from a private location \u2014 a contingency plan agreed upon ahead of time in case things got out of control . You can even faintly hear protesters still shouting outside the new venue in the video of their talk .\nAllison Stanger ( left ) chats with Charles Murray . ( Image source : Middlebury College video screen cap )\nBut when Stanger and Murray exited the room , protesters were ready for them .\n`` We confronted an angry mob as we tried to exit the building , '' Stanger wrote . `` Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray , but when I took his right arm both to shield him from attack and to make sure we stayed together so I could reach the car too , that \u2019 s when the hatred turned on me . ''\nStanger said that a `` thug grabbed me by the hair and another shoved me in a different direction . I noticed signs with expletives and my name on them . ... For those of you who marched in Washington the day after the inauguration , imagine being in a crowd like that , only being surrounded by hatred rather than love . I feared for my life . ''\nMurray also wrote about the experience , noting the mob attack came despite the presence of `` two large and capable security guards . '' Seems that among the mob `` a big man with a sign was standing right in front of us and wasn \u2019 t going to let us pass , '' Murray said . Their only option ? Walking right toward the guy as a security guard `` pushed him aside , '' he recalled .\n`` The three of us got to the car , with the security guards keeping protesters away while we closed and locked the doors , '' Murray said . `` Then we found that the evening wasn \u2019 t over . So many protesters surrounded the car , banging on the sides and the windows and rocking the car , climbing onto the hood . ''\nThey actually had to take a `` decoy route '' to their post-event dinner , Stanger wrote , adding she told a colleague she `` felt proud of myself for not having slugged someone . '' But the respite was short-lived . Stanger said they were told the protesters knew where they were and that they should leave .\n`` We raced back to the car , driving over the curb and sidewalk to escape quickly , '' Stanger recalled . `` It was then we decided that it was probably best to leave town . ''\nAfter all was said and done , Stanger needed a trip to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a concussion .\n`` This was the saddest day of my life , '' she added .\nA college \u2019 s faculty is the obvious resource for keeping the bubble translucent and the intellectual thugs from taking over . A faculty that is overwhelmingly on the side of free intellectual exchange , stipulating only that it be conducted with logic , evidence , and civility , can easily lead each new freshman class to understand that \u2019 s how academia operates . If faculty members routinely condemn intellectual thuggery , the majority of students who also oppose it will feel entitled to say \u201c sit down and shut up , we want to hear what he has to say \u201d when protesters try to shut down intellectual exchange . That leads me to two critical questions for which I have no empirical answers : What is the percentage of tenured faculty on American campuses who are still unambiguously on the side of free intellectual exchange ? What is the percentage of them who are willing to express that position openly ? I am confident that the answer to the first question is still far greater than fifty percent . But what about the answer to the second question ? My reading of events on campuses over the last few years is that a minority of faculty are cowing a majority in the same way that a minority of students are cowing the majority .\nPeter Beinart , a journalism and political science professor at City University of New York \u2014 and a liberal \u2014 wrote a piece for The Atlantic condemning the Middlebury incident , saying it `` suggests that something has gone badly wrong on the campus left .
