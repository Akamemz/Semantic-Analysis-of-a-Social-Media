    "content": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president . The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers .\nAmerica had just elected a Democratic president . The Senate was majority-Democratic . The House of Representatives had more Democrats than at any time since 1992 .\nThe Republicans could either change themselves -- by embracing the young , diverse and tolerant America of the 21st century -- or they could try to change whose voices count in our democracy .\nWe all know the cynical path they chose . Six years ago Thursday , the Supreme Court 's decision in Citizens United transformed our politics by allowing corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections .\nThe effect was immediate . In the 2010 midterms , outside groups spent nearly 60 % more than in 2006 . In 2014 , the top 100 donors spent nearly as much as all 4.75 million small donors combined . National networks of big-money donors funneled mountains of cash into targeted state races . By 2014 , one party controlled both the governor 's mansion and the state legislature in 36 states -- the most since the 1950s .\nMeanwhile , Republicans launched an aggressive campaign to restrict voting rights across the country . After the 2010 election , lawmakers in 41 states introduced at least 180 measures designed to make it harder for people to vote . This ugly effort got a boost in 2013 when the Supreme Court made another disastrous ruling , striking down hard-won Voting Rights Act protections . Today , 21 states have new laws restricting voting rights .\nAnd some of the greatest damage to voting rights has come in states with single-party control -- like North Carolina , which eliminated same-day voter registration and slashed early voting ; Florida , which instituted such heavy restrictions on voter registration drives that the League of Women Voters had to shut down operations ; and Alabama , which passed a strict photo ID requirement and then closed dozens of driver 's license offices across the state , making it much harder for citizens to get the IDs they now need to vote .\nPut it all together -- the flood of corporate money in our elections , the rise of single-party control of state governments , the sharp increase in voting-rights restrictions -- and the result is unmistakable . Our democracy is being hollowed out . And that should offend every American , no matter what party you belong to .\nWe ca n't let this continue . It 's time to reclaim our democracy , reform our distorted campaign finance system and restore access to the ballot box in all 50 states .\nThat starts with reversing Citizens United . And that 's where my comprehensive plan to restore common sense to campaign finance begins . As president , I 'll appoint Supreme Court justices who recognize that Citizens United is bad for America . And if necessary , I 'll fight for a constitutional amendment that overturns it .\nMeanwhile , we need more transparency in our politics . In the last three elections , more than $ 600 million in donations came from unknown , untraceable sources . That 's a lot of secret , unaccountable money . As president , I 'll require federal contractors to fully disclose their political spending . I 'll call on the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that publicly traded companies do the same .
