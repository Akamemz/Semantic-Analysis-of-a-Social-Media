Ted Cruz , another insurgent candidate .\nMr. Cruz has run a more traditional campaign than the New York billionaire , who has focused on drop-in rallies rather than zeroing in on the diner circuit in New Hampshire or Pizza Ranches in Iowa .\nWith tight nominating races in both the Democratic and Republican parties , the votes Monday are shaping up to be late-night cliffhangers that could set up the trajectory toward the November presidential election .\nWith even Mr. Cruz warning that an Iowa-New Hampshire sweep for Mr. Trump could make the billionaire unstoppable , Mr. Trump rallied supporters in this Iowa city on the Nebraska border with Christian conservative Jerry Falwell Jr. at his side , boasting of the fervor and commitment of his voter base .\n\u201c The Trump voter is the most loyal by far , \u201d Mr. Trump said to cheers and applause from a rowdy crowd of 1,000 people in a high school gym . \u201c My people \u2014 I adore you . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Marco Rubio reportedly wins Sen.

Marco Rubio with 15 percent , retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson with 10 percent and Sen. Rand Paul with 5 percent .\nMr. Trump also leads the field in New Hampshire , according to Real Clear Politics , which shows him with 18 percentage points over his nearest rival , Ohio Gov .
