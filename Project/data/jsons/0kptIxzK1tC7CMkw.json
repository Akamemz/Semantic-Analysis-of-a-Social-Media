Placebos aren \u2019 t just sugar pills disguised as medicine , though that \u2019 s the literal definition ; they are any intervention , benign but believed by the recipient to be potent , that produces measurable physiological changes . Placebo effects are a striking phenomenon and still not all that well understood .

Neuroscientists are charting what \u2019 s going on in the brain when expectations alone reduce pain or relieve Parkinson \u2019 s symptoms . More traditionally minded health researchers acknowledge the role of placebo effects and account for them in their experiments . But Langer goes well beyond that . She thinks they \u2019 re huge \u2014 so huge that in many cases they may actually be the main factor producing the results .\nAs an example , she points to a study she conducted in a hair salon in 2009 . She got the idea from a study undertaken nearly a decade earlier by three scientists who looked at more than 4,000 subjects over two decades and found that men who were bald when they joined the study were more likely to develop prostate cancer than men who kept their hair . The researchers couldn \u2019 t be sure what explained the link , though they suspected that androgens ( male hormones including testosterone ) could be affecting both scalp and prostate . Langer had another theory : \u201c Baldness is a cue for old age , \u201d she says . \u201c Therefore , men who go bald early in life may perceive themselves as older and may consequently be expected to age more quickly. \u201d And those expectations may actually lead them to experience the effects of aging . To explore this relationship between expectations of aging and physiological signs of health , Langer and her colleagues designed the hair-salon study . They had research assistants approach 47 women , ranging in age from 27 to 83 , who were about to have their hair cut , colored or both . They took blood-pressure readings . After the subjects \u2019 hair was done , they filled out a questionnaire about how they felt they looked , and their blood pressure was taken again . In a paper published in 2010 in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science , they reported that the subjects who perceived themselves as looking younger after the makeover experienced a drop in blood pressure .\nA few years earlier , Langer and one of her students , Alia Crum , conducted a study , published in the journal Psychological Science , involving 84 hotel chambermaids . The maids had mostly reported that they didn \u2019 t get much exercise in a typical week . The researchers primed the experimental group to think differently about their work by informing them that cleaning rooms was fairly serious exercise \u2014 as much if not more than the surgeon general recommends . Once their expectations were shifted , those maids lost weight , relative to a control group ( and also improved on other measures like body mass index and hip-to-waist ratio ) . All other factors were held constant .

Just before winter break , in her final meeting with two dozen or so students and postdocs , Langer went around the table checking the progress of nearly 30 experiments , all of which manipulated subjects \u2019 perceptions .
