This is critical to our national security for two reasons that bear directly on the question of which aliens should , and which should not , be allowed into our country .\nFirst , reform is essential because the broader Islamic religion includes a significant subset of Muslims who adhere to an anti-American totalitarian political ideology that demands implementation of sharia \u2014 Islamic law .
