    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The White House is making a concerted effort to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci as he becomes increasingly vocal about his concerns over reopening the country amid a national surge in coronavirus cases . The moves to undercut Fauci come just days after he gave an unvarnished look at his relationship with President Donald Trump , including that they have not spoken in weeks .\nThe tension between the two men -- who are no longer speaking , CNN reported last week -- has grown publicly as they have responded to one another through interviews and statements .\nTrump does not plan to dismiss Fauci , and probably could n't directly fire him if he wanted to , White House officials have determined . He insisted on Monday that his relationship with the doctor remains strong .\n`` I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci , I 've had for a long time , '' Trump said at the White House during a roundtable event honoring police officers . `` I find him to be a very nice person . I do n't always agree with him . ''\nBut recent moves by the White House to publicly diminish the nation 's top infectious disease expert amounts to a significant escalation as it seeks to divert attention from the government 's failure to contain the coronavirus and instead push Trump 's call to reopen the country . That effort continued Monday morning , when the President retweeted a baseless claim by game show host Chuck Woolery that `` everyone is lying '' about the coronavirus -- including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nIn a statement Saturday , a White House official told CNN that `` several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things . '' The official went on to provide a lengthy list of examples , citing Fauci 's comments early in the pandemic and linking to past interviews .\nThese bullet points , which resembled opposition research on a political opponent , included Fauci downplaying the virus early on and a quote from March when Fauci said , `` People should not be walking around with masks , '' among other comments . Not included were previous statements from the surgeon general urging people not to buy masks or an acknowledgment of the President 's own false claims and misstatements about the virus .\nOn Monday , the White House insisted it was not trying to discredit Fauci . Speaking during a midday briefing , press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said officials simply `` provided a direct answer to what was a direct question '' when they issued the list of Fauci 's statements .\n`` There 's no opposition research being dumped to reporters , '' she said , insisting later that Trump and Fauci have `` always had a very good working relationship . ''\nAsked about Trump 's retweet slamming the CDC , McEnany said Trump was simply going after `` rogue individuals . ''\n`` Overall the notion of the tweet was to point out the fact that when we use science , we have to use it in a way that is not political , '' she said .\nFauci did not return a request for comment by CNN . But he has at times openly disagreed with Trump in a series of recent newspaper and radio interviews .\nIn particular , a recent interview with the Financial Times in which Fauci disclosed that he has not briefed the President in weeks prompted the White House to distribute the list of Fauci statements , an aide familiar with the matter said . Among other things , Fauci disputed Trump 's claim that `` 99 % '' of coronavirus cases in the United States were `` totally harmless '' -- saying that was `` obviously not the case '' -- and drew a connection between his insistence on `` speaking the truth at all times '' to his noticeably diminished television appearances .\nDespite the ongoing White House attempts to discredit Fauci , Trump has not expressed interest in firing the infectious disease specialist , according to a senior administration official .\nEven if he wanted to , White House officials said they believed it would be difficult to dismiss Fauci from his position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , a position he has held since 1984 . As a member of the Senior Executive Service , Fauci could only be fired for cause and only by a direct supervisor , such as Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar or National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins .\nWhile Trump could instruct Azar to fire Fauci and could concoct a cause , that would likely be subject to a lengthy process that Fauci could appeal . Officials said they believed it highly unlikely the President would take that step and say he has not voiced a desire to do so at this point .\nAside from the regulatory hurdles , Trump has also recognized it would be politically damaging if he sought Fauci 's removal because Fauci is considered credible by a large swath of Americans and by members of Congress . Though he seems comfortable with publicly discrediting him , Trump has also acknowledged in private that Fauci is well regarded .\nInstead , officials said it was more likely Fauci is left to twist in the wind , as other administration officials have done previously as they come under fire from Trump and the White House . Trump could also potentially remove Fauci from the White House coronavirus task force -- a body comprised at his own order , without any statutory mandate -- though Trump has not engaged personally with the task force in months .\nA person familiar with the situation acknowledged that Fauci has been appearing on television less frequently because Trump is annoyed by his public statements . Though Trump was already miffed by Fauci 's television appearances early on , the White House has sought to downplay tension between the two for several months . The press shop stopped approving Fauci 's television appearances , believing it would help alleviate the situation , though they continued to allow him to give interviews with print outlets .\nAnother person familiar has said the rare in-person meetings between Trump and Fauci are not awkward and do n't involve raised voices , but Trump has complained about Fauci privately .
