Their principal , Krystal Hardy , looks on .\n\u201c Pay attention ! I \u2019 ve seen these kinds of questions on the PARCC test , \u201d says math teacher Tiffany Labrie , referring to the Common Core tests that most students in Louisiana take this month . \u201c This calls for converting ounces to pounds , so you can use your reference sheet , \u201d she tells them , indicating a handout on every desk .\n\u201c Don \u2019 t forget , you can use the reference sheet today , but also on the what ? \u201d asks Ms. Labrie , rhetorically .\n\u201c PARCC ! \u201d echoes Labrie . \u201c You \u2019 ll have those reference sheets during the PARCC tests . Remember to use them ! \u201d\nMs. Hardy \u2013 who is in her first year as principal \u2013 has staked her career on improving the culture and upping the test scores at this struggling elementary school , located in a gritty part of New Orleans ' Central City neighborhood . At the start of the academic year in August , 50 percent of the approximately 400 students , nearly all of whom are African-American and most of whom are poor , scored below grade level in reading and math . Their road to improvement is paved with tests .\nIndeed , like most public school students across America , pupils at Sylvanie Williams get tested often \u2013 although Hardy is trying to balance the \u201c data-driven instruction \u201d with a strong social justice curriculum .\nThe earliest tests this year helped teachers figure out which students had learned the material and which ones needed that lesson again . After five months , Hardy and her staff began diving deeper , comparing test results with worksheets that students completed in class . When they saw patterns of errors , the teachers themselves worked through the problems , trying to figure out exactly where the students were going wrong .\nTheir findings have already dramatically changed the way teachers teach . And the teachers are noticing that student achievement is picking up .\n\u201c Instead of saying , \u2018 Some of these students aren \u2019 t good at multiplying , \u2019 \u201d she says , \u201c we could start to say , for example , that 40 percent of these students in this class don \u2019 t seem to understand the place-value concept in three-digit numbers and about 40 percent , say , understand the concept but are not paying attention to details when they compute . \u201d\nStudents at Sylvanie Williams take annual tests in science and social studies aligned to the state \u2019 s standards , plus two rounds of Common Core tests in English and math developed by the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ( PARCC ) . In some grades , students also take three sets of benchmarking tests three or four times a year . In the end , third-graders , who get tested the most , take a whopping 14 standardized tests per year , in addition to \u201c exit tickets \u201d \u2013 teacher-generated assessments at the end of a unit of study .\nTesting infuses many aspects of the school day . The walls of Hardy \u2019 s office and the teachers \u2019 conference room are hung with posters sporting bar charts that show test results . Students and teachers talk about the test , the test day , and \u201c reaching basic . \u201d\nOutside a third-grade classroom , a colorful hand-drawn poster names the children who have achieved the advanced , mastery , and basic levels on one test . In another classroom , a teacher has written out in magic marker a several-foot-long list of standards ( 4.NF.5 : Express equivalent fractions and add fractions with denominators of 10 and 100 ) \u2013 presumably to keep his own teaching on target for the Common Core math test .\nAlthough a vocal minority of parents whose children tend to be enrolled in more affluent schools around the country have refused to let their kids take the Common Core tests , no Sylvanie Williams families have opted out .
