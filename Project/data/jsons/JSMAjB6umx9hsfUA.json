    "content": "Boris Johnson and EU leaders have hailed the deal they have struck to take the UK out of the bloc on 31 October in an `` orderly '' fashion .\nThe prime minister now faces a battle to get the deal through Parliament on Saturday , with the DUP opposing it .\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds accused Mr Johnson of being `` too eager by far to get a deal at any cost '' .\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk did not rule out an extension to the Brexit deadline if MPs rejected it .\nEU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker earlier said : `` We have a deal so why should we have a prolongation . ''\nBut his Brussels colleagues have been more cautious , with Mr Tusk saying he would `` consult '' the leaders of EU member states about a possible extension if one was requested by the UK .\nHe said Boris Johnson 's acceptance of customs checks at the point of entry into Northern Ireland , which the DUP objects to , had made a deal possible .\nMr Johnson has repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October and he urged MPs to `` come together '' and `` get this excellent deal over the line '' .\nHe added : `` Now is the moment for us to get Brexit done and then together work on building our future partnership , which I think can be incredibly positive both for the UK and for the EU . ''\nThe EU and UK negotiating teams worked round-the-clock on the legal text of the deal , but it will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments .\nIn a statement , the Democratic Unionist Party , which the government relies on for support in key votes , said : `` These proposals are not , in our view , beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union . ''\nThe DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds criticised Mr Johnson , telling \u2588\u2588\u2588 : `` If he 'd held his nerve - and held out - he would , of course , have got better concessions which kept the integrity , both economic and constitutional , of the UK . ''\nHe said he expected a `` massive vote '' against Mr Johnson 's deal on Saturday in the House of Commons - and the DUP expected to `` play a crucial role '' in amending the legislation .\nThe winning post for votes in the House of Commons is 320 if everyone turns up - seven Sinn Fein MPs do n't sit and the Speaker and three deputies do n't vote .\nThere are currently 287 voting Conservative MPs . The prime minister needs to limit any rebellion among them .\nThen , if the DUP wo n't support his deal , he 'll need the backing of 23 former Conservative MPs who are currently independents . Most will probably support the deal , but not all .\nThat 's still not quite enough , though , so the PM will also need the backing of some Labour MPs and ex-Labour independents . In March , when MPs voted on Theresa May 's deal for the third time , five Labour MPs backed it , plus two ex-Labour independents .\nThis time it 's likely to be a bit higher than that because several MPs have said they would now back a deal .\nAll this still leaves the vote very close . And it 's possible some MPs could abstain , making it even harder to predict the outcome .\nMost of the deal is the same as the one agreed by Theresa May last year - the main change is the Northern Ireland proposal .\nThe UK will continue to abide by EU rules until the end of 2020 , and possibly longer , to allow businesses to adjust\nThe UK will still pay an estimated \u00a333bn `` divorce bill ''\nThe rights of EU citizens living in the UK , and UK citizens in the EU , will be guaranteed\nNorthern Ireland will be aligned to the EU single market\nThe controversial `` backstop '' - that critics feared could have kept the UK in a customs union with the EU indefinitely - has been removed\nNorthern Ireland will instead remain a part of the UK 's customs territory , so it will be included in any future trade deals struck by the government after Brexit\nBut Northern Ireland will also remain an entry point into the EU 's customs zone .
