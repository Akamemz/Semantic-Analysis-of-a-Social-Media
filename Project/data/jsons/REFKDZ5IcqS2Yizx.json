The line got hearty applause\u2014but it also cut to the core of one of the defining lines of attacks against the former first lady and Democratic presidential frontrunner . After nearly forty years in public life , what exactly has she accomplished ?\nIt \u2019 s a question that even , at times , has tripped up Clinton herself : During her 2014 book tour , when ABC \u2019 s Diane Sawyer asked her about her \u201c marquee achievement , \u201d Clinton changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a women \u2019 s forum in Manhattan last year . \u201c I see my role as secretary\u2014in fact leadership in general in a democracy\u2014as a relay race . You run the best race you can run , you hand off the baton . Some of what hasn \u2019 t been finished may go on to be finished , \u201d she told Thomas Friedman . \u201c I \u2019 m very proud of the [ economic ] stabilization and the really solid leadership that the administration provided that I think now leads us to be able to deal with problems like Ukraine because we \u2019 re not so worried about a massive collapse in Europe . \u201d\nThe question Fiorina posed has also tripped up members of the Obama administration . When State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki was asked last year to \u201c identify one tangible achievement \u201d accomplished through one of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s key projects as Secretary of State\u2014the first-ever audit of the department\u2014Psaki punted , \u201c I am certain that those who were here at the time , who worked hard on that effort , could point out one . \u201d\nHillary \u2019 s supporters have been stumped too . When Bloomberg Politics \u2019 Mark Halperin asked a focus group of Iowans this summer about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s accomplishments , one Democratic supporter said , \u201c I honestly can \u2019 t say I followed along [ with ] everything that was going on . \u201d\nSo is Fiorina right ? Are Democrats really unable to defend Clinton \u2019 s record on the merits ? To find out , \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine on Thursday asked the nation \u2019 s top Democratic leaders and thinkers to name Hillary Clinton \u2019 s biggest accomplishment .\nWhat is the most impressive item on Clinton \u2019 s record ? Which legislative or policy triumph from her many years in office will be most important on the campaign trail ? Not surprisingly , those surveyed all came up with an answer to defend their party \u2019 s likely presidential nominee . Whether these count as \u201c marquee , \u201d \u201c significant , \u201d or \u201c tangible \u201d ? You be the judge .\nBy Bill Burton , former senior strategist for Priorities USA Action , a super PAC in support of President Barack Obama .\nIt \u2019 s kind of hard to pick one accomplishment for Hillary Clinton . Personally , I \u2019 m sure she \u2019 d say her daughter and grandchild are her greatest accomplishments . Professionally , how about these three ?\n3 . Management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China , aggressive work on climate ( particularly at Copenhagen ) , and the effort to create and implement the toughest sanctions ever on Iran\u2014helping to lead us to the agreement currently on the table .\n\u2018 The sanction on Iran that brought them to the table \u2019\nHoward Dean is the former governor of Vermont and the former chair of the Democratic National Committee .\nHillary Clinton was the principal author of the sanction on Iran that brought them to the table . We can not afford any Know Nothings like Carly in the White House .\n\u2018 Nearly every foreign policy victory of President Obama \u2019 s second term has Secretary Clinton \u2019 s fingerprints on it \u2019\nAmerican foreign policy was stronger when Hillary Clinton left the State Department than when she arrived . She took the reins from a Bush administration that had left America \u2019 s reputation deeply damaged and planted the seeds for the foreign policy successes we see today . From the agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , to the landmark normalization of relations with Cuba , nearly every foreign policy victory of President Obama \u2019 s second term has Secretary Clinton \u2019 s fingerprints on it .\nHer accomplishments extend to health care , as well . As First Lady , she helped create and guide through Congress Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program , a key program that brought health care coverage to millions of children . As a Senator , she worked across the aisle to provide full military health benefits to reservists and National Guard members .\nSecretary Clinton was also an outspoken champion for women around the world . She set records for travel while leading the State Department and used every trip to empower the women of the 112 countries she visited . She made gender equality a priority of U.S. foreign policy . And she created the ambassador at large for global women \u2019 s issues , a post charged with integrating gender throughout the State Department .\n\u2018 The SCHIP program \u2026 which expanded health coverage to millions of lower-income children \u2019\nAfter universal health care failed in 1994 , the Clinton Administration was reluctant to go anywhere near healthcare again\u2014Democrats lost the Senate and the House in 1994 , and losing the house was for the first time in 40 years . Then-First Lady Hilary Clinton ended up being the White House ally and inside player who worked with Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch to create the SCHIP program in Clinton 's second term , which expanded health coverage to millions of lower-income children . She has other accomplishments but this one made a huge difference , and came at a time when politically the Administration was cutting deals with Newt Gingrich on the budget and not necessarily all that enthusiastic about revisiting health care .\nThis obviously is n't her only accomplishment but it is meaningful because she took a political battering after the failure in 1994 but came back to fight again , and was able to work on a bipartisan basis during a very polarized time to get this done .

Senator for New York , Democratic party .\nHillary Clinton is one of the most accomplished people ever to run for the Presidency . I \u2019 m lucky enough to have seen those accomplishments up close from her time as Senator from New York and as Secretary of State . Hillary Clinton was instrumental in helping secure $ 21 billion in federal aid to help New York rebuild after 9/11 . She fought tooth and nail to protect the first responders who rushed into danger when the towers collapsed and was pivotal in the passage of legislation that helped those first responders who got sick get the care and treatment they deserved .

She helped secure the START treaty \u2019 s ratification , and has advanced women \u2019 s rights in countries around the globe . That \u2019 s just a snapshot of what Hillary Clinton has accomplished over a lifetime of public service to New York and the country .
