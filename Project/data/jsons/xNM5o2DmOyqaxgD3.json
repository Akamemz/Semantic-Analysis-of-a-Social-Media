    "content": "As liberal networks debate whether to pull broadcasting pressers from the president of the United States because they don \u2019 t like him , one anti-Trump network might not have a choice if they want to boost ratings . CNN had quite a dismal first quarter , with not a single one of their programs cracking the top 20 in the rating chart . President Trump has made the network his top punching bag , and rightfully so . It \u2019 s no secret that the top brass at CNN hate Trump .\nFox News continues to dominate , but even MSNBC , who hates Trump , even more , was able to break into the top 20 on multiple fronts . As John Nolte of Breitbart noted , maybe trying to forcibly mainline the impeachment nonsense into the American bloodstream was just bad for the health of the country\u2014and it was ( via Breitbart ) :\nFox News placed eight shows in the top ten and 14 in the top 20 . The openly left-wing MSNBC filled those other slots . CNNLOL finally arrives way behind its cable news competitors , at number 22 , with Jake Tapper \u2019 s basement-rated The Lead , which still only managed to attract 1.387 million viewers . And Tapper probably only did that well because some of President Trump \u2019 s popular daily briefings aired during his otherwise anemic timeslot . Sean Hannity topped everyone during the quarter with an average of 4.22 million viewers , which more than triples CNN \u2019 s top show . In fact , the only Fox program CNN was able to beat was Fox and Friends First , which broadcasts before dawn and still managed to come in 40th with 721,000 average viewers . The pre-dawn Fox and Friends First humiliated CNNLOL \u2019 s disastrous morning show , New Day , which was only able to attract 580,000 average viewers . Overall , Fox News had its biggest viewing quarter in the network \u2019 s history , averaging 3.4 million primetime viewers and 1.9 million total-day viewers . CNNLOL was only able to average 1.43 million primetime viewers , with MSNBC coming in at 1.93 million . Fox News beat both combined . During primetime , CNNLOL managed to lose to ESPN ( 1.43 million compared to 1.5 million ) , even though sports events have been dead for weeks due to coronavirus cancellations .\nThat \u2019 s brutal any way you cut it . And it \u2019 s not like this is a new thing . For years , CNN has been in a ratings slump . If it weren \u2019 t for CNN International , which isn \u2019 t nearly as Trump deranged , then it \u2019 s possible that this noted anti-Trump network would probably have to close up shop . And while that may sound like a good thing in terms of curbing the anti-Trump nonsense that 's spewed daily by the liberal opposition press , CNN is just one actor in that Axis of Evil . It \u2019 s a massive enemy that \u2019 s well-connected , well-financed , and still has reach . And no , CNN isn \u2019 t going away anytime soon , but the president has some more ammunition to unload on them when their reporters get cute at pressers in the future .",
