    "content": "So much for all those promises . Leading politicians in the campaign to pull the U.K. out of the European Union are back-pedaling fast on a number of pledges , particularly over extra money for health care .\nThe retreat has prompted howls of outrage , from politicians who wanted Britain to stay in the EU as well as some Leave voters who say they feel `` cheated . ''\nHere are three pledges that are crumbling days after the historic Brexit vote :\nCampaign promise # 1 : We 'll give EU cash to the National Health Service\nThe official Vote Leave campaign claimed that membership in the EU cost the U.K. \u00a3350 million a week , `` enough to build a brand new , fully staffed ... hospital every week . ''\nThe slogan was painted on the side of the campaign 's bright red bus . Pro-Brexit politicians continued to make the claim , despite being repeatedly admonished by the independent statistics watchdog for misleading voters .\nIain Duncan Smith , a leading figure in Vote Leave , told the BBC that the campaign did n't say `` all '' of it would go to the NHS but `` a significant amount of it '' would .\nNigel Farage , leader of the U.K . Independence Party and who campaigned for Brexit said implying that money sent to the EU could be spent on the health service in the future was a mistake .\n`` No I ca n't [ guarantee it ] , and I would never have made that claim . That was one of the mistakes that I think the Leave campaign made , '' he said on British TV after the vote .\nAbout half of the money Britain hands over to the EU is returned to the country via subsidies for farmers , grants for research and funding for infrastructure . And that money is already committed .\nBrexiteers told Britain 's farmers and poor regions such as Cornwall that they would n't lose out financially once those funds are cut off . They made similar commitments to support U.K. universities and scientists -- the second biggest beneficiaries of research grants from the EU .\nCornwall , in southwest England , voted in favor of leaving the EU . Local officials are already seeking confirmation from the government that the county wo n't be worse off as a result .\nCampaign promise # 2 : We 'll take control of the UK 's borders\nDuring the campaign , Brexiteers attacked the U.K. government for missing its target to cut net migration to tens of thousands ( it was 333,000 last year ) , saying that only by leaving the EU could Britain control immigration .\nMany voters say they backed Brexit because they expected immigration to fall .\nLeave campaigner and lawmaker Nigel Evans told BBC radio that there had been `` some misunderstanding '' over the Leave campaign 's position on reducing immigration .\nWhen asked if the number of people coming into the country would fall significantly , Evans said that a new Australian-style points system for EU migrants meant the U.K. would be able to control immigration -- but he did n't say it would fall .\nBrexit voters have another problem : Negotiations on the terms of Britain 's exit have n't even begun . The U.K. may have to keep its borders open to EU workers if it wants to trade freely with the rest of Europe -- a view articulated on Friday by Daniel Hannan , another leading voice in the Leave campaign .\n`` Do n't care what you said Mr Hannan . We just voted to stop mass immigration . Now deliver for us , '' tweeted Vote Leave Derbyshire .\n@ DanHannanMEP @ PaulDBrant @ jreedmp I DO N'T CARE WHAT YOU SAID MR HANNAN . WE JUST VOTED TO STOP MASS IMMIGRATION . NOW DELIVER FOR US . \u2014 VoteLeave Derbyshire ( @ DerbyshireLeave ) June 25 , 2016\nBoris Johnson , a leading Leave campaigner and frontrunner to be next prime minister , wrote on Sunday that British citizens will still have access to the EU single market .\n`` British people will still be able to go and work in the EU ; to live ; to travel ; to study ; to buy homes ; and to settle down , '' he wrote for the Telegraph .\nThe problem , of course , is that such continued freedom of movement for Brits will require freedom of movement for Europeans .\nThe U.K. government and just about every independent forecaster , including the International Monetary Fund , said that a vote for Brexit would trigger financial and economic turmoil .\nThose warnings were dubbed `` Project Fear '' by Brexiteers , who said the U.K. would thrive outside the EU .\nConsider this : Since the results of the vote became known early Friday , the pound has crashed 12 % against the U.S. dollar to its lowest level in decades , U.K. bank stocks have collapsed , and growth forecasts for the British economy have been slashed .\nCompanies are putting investments on hold , and warning of lower profits .
