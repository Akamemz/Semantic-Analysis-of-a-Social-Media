''\nHealth officials have said it 's possible that someone who had close contact with that first patient after he became ill \u2014 the only time that Ebola is contagious \u2014 might also get sick . But they say further spread is unlikely because of the public health steps now underway .\n`` We respect your concern . We understand your concern . But the evidence base tells us that that is not going to happen , '' Fauci said .\nThe White House said Obama planned to meet with his national security advisers on Monday to discuss the Ebola outbreak and the administration 's response .\nThe administration has long contended that the best way to contain Ebola is to attack it at its source . The Pentagon 's spokesman said Friday that up to 4,000 troops could be deployed to West Africa , a number that has been slowly climbing as military leaders arrive and assess the need .\nNavy Rear Adm. John Kirby said the military has begun medical testing for Ebola at two new labs in Liberia . Also , service members are starting to build two treatment centers there for victims of the deadly disease , and that a hospital for infected medical personnel should be finished by the end of the month .\nKirby said that the service members are not going to treat patients and are not expected to come in contact with anyone who is infected .
