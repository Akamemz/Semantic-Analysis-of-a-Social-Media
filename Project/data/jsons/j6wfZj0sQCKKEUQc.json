    "content": "RIYADH , Saudi Arabia \u2014 King Salman bin Abdul Aziz came to the airport himself Tuesday to greet President Barack Obama and lead him through a show of Saudi pomp on the tarmac that showed no signs of just how quickly assembled it was .\nThe surprise appearance of the new king seemed designed to answer questions swirling around the relationship \u2014 even as they flew in from India , White House aides acknowledged that the president barely knows the new king , and would not directly discuss whether they think Salman is in good physical and mental health .\nObama and Salman spoke through an interpreter , then greeted a procession of Saudi dignitaries after listening to a military band play first the \u201c Star Spangled Banner , \u201d then the Saudi national anthem .\nThe timing could hardly be more delicate , with the U.S. approaching a potential endgame in nuclear negotiations with Saudi Arabia \u2019 s archenemy , Iran , and conflicts flaring on Saudi Arabia \u2019 s borders with Yemen and Syria that threaten both countries .\nIn a sign of the high stakes , a visit that began as a hastily scheduled condolence call for King Abdullah , who died last week , has now been stretched to include a bilateral meeting and formal dinner for Obama with Salman , Abdullah \u2019 s successor .\n\u201c It \u2019 ll be important to the president to establish that relationship with King Salman , \u201d deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One as they flew here from New Delhi .\nObama \u2019 s relationship with Abdullah had its problems but was close , Rhodes said , and \u201c he \u2019 ll want to develop the same kind of relationship with King Salman where we \u2019 re able to move forward on areas of common interest and able to be very candid and frank with one another about developments in the region . \u201d\nPrime on that list , Rhodes said , is the effort to counter the terrorist group in Syria known as Islamic State in Syria and the Levant , or ISIL .\nThough originally Vice President Joe Biden was going to fly in for the condolence call , the White House canceled Obama \u2019 s planned tourist stop at the Taj Mahal so he could personal make a visit that \u2019 s become a major event of American diplomacy .\nObama was met here by a U.S. delegation that also includes Secretary of State John Kerry , former Secretaries of State James Baker and Condoleeza Rice ; former National Security Advisers Brent Scowcroft , Sandy Berger and Stephen Hadley ; CIA director John Brennan and Obama \u2019 s homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco ; who just concluded a trip to Afghanistan . Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) is also part of it , along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) and the other members of Congress traveling back with Obama from India .\nObama is scheduled to be on the ground for just over four hours \u2014 crucial face time in a country that places a particularly high value on in-person diplomacy , experts say . Obama has so far only had glancing encounters with Salman , who spent most of his government career focused on internal matters that provided little reason to work with Americans . The interaction could be particularly important given speculation that the 79-year-old monarch is in frail health and something less than lucid .\nAsked directly whether the White House believes Salman is in good mental and physical health , Rhodes paused and ducked a straight answer .\n\u201c We certainly do believe , uh , that he is ready to assume the duties of king of Saudi Arabia , \u201d Rhodes said , quickly moving to talk about the closer relationship that the United States has with the new second and third in line to the throne , Prince Mohammed bin Nayaf and Prince Muqrin .\nThe brief stop here is also an opportunity to take stock of how badly the two countries need one another . After an often-uncomfortable relationship with Abdullah , Obama will be looking to establish a better comfort level with his younger brother , said Simon Henderson , a Saudi expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy . Henderson said the U.S.-Saudi relationship \u201c needs to be reset \u201d and reevaluated \u201c from first principles . \u201d\nThe U.S. president also will need to do a gut-check and decide whether , before leaving office , he wants to more openly challenge the values of a repressive theocracy that he described in a 2002 speech as America \u2019 s so-called allies .\nEarlier Tuesday , Obama spoke in a national address to India about the need for religious tolerance and equality\n\u201c When women are able to work , families are healthier , communities are wealthier and entire countries are more prosperous , \u201d Obama said . \u201c So if nations really want to succeed in today \u2019 global economy , they can \u2019 t simply ignore the talents of half of their people .\nSuch a message is unlikely to play as well in Saudi Arabia . Rhodes would only commit to that same kind of urging being in the background of what Obama will say to Salman .\n\u201c Places don \u2019 t change overnight , but I think with Saudi Arabia , what we \u2019 ve said we support is a reform process that does provide for greater respect for those types of universal values , \u201d Rhodes said . \u201c But clearly , much more work needs to be done to realize the types of values that the president was talking about in India . \u201d\nBy many measures the bond is nonetheless strong : Saudi Arabia has provided the U.S. with vital assistance against terrorism , helping to disrupt multiple terror plots . It is also what a senior administration official calls a \u201c strategic partner \u201d against ISIL , which has seized large swaths of northern Iraq and eastern Syria . The U.S. also has cooperated with Saudi Arabia on other security issues like Middle East peace and Egypt \u2019 s post-revolution political transition .\nAnd Riyadh \u2019 s decision not to prop up plunging oil prices with production cuts has pummeled the economies of Russia and Iran \u2014 much to Washington \u2019 s delight .\nObama and Abdullah never quite saw eye-to-eye \u2014 and the same may go for the mostly like-minded Salman . The late Saudi king , already frustrated that the U.S. wasn \u2019 t doing more to aid Syrian rebels fighting the Iran-backed Syrian dictator Bashar Assad , was dismayed when Obama abruptly decided not to strike Assad in September 2013 after his regime detonated chemical weapons in rebel-controlled areas , killing many civilians . Saudi leaders who had been hearing talk of a \u201c pivot to Asia \u201d were left questioning Obama \u2019 s commitment to Middle East security . Abdullah questioned whether a president just over half his age and with little prior foreign policy experience understood the Middle East \u2019 s harsh realities .\nThat was especially true when it came to Iran . The Saudi royals are devout Sunni Muslims who compete with Iran \u2019 s Shiite regime for regional power . Abdullah doubted Obama \u2019 s diplomatic outreach to Tehran from the start , thinking it na\u00efve , and was then infuriated to learn that the U.S. had secretly begun the nuclear talks in early 2013 without notifying him . The mistrust grew serious enough for some prominent Saudis to suggest that Obama wanted to swap Iran for their country as America \u2019 s key regional ally .\n\u201c They fear a \u2018 grand bargain \u2019 with Iran in which a nuclear deal also cedes influence in Iraq , and perhaps Syria to Iran , \u201d said Robert Jordan , George W. Bush \u2019 s first ambassador to Saudi Arabia who is now diplomat in residence at the John Tower Center for Political Studies at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .\nJune 30 is the current deadline for a nuclear agreement between Iran , the U.S. and five international powers involved in the talks aimed at curbing Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions that began in late 2013 .\nU.S. officials call the notion of a grand strategic shift toward Iran premature \u2014 a message Obama sought to convey during his final visit with Abdullah in Riyadh last March . At the time , Obama repeated his determination to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb , and his insistence that any nuclear deal he strikes achieve that \u2014 themes he \u2019 s sure to repeat while visiting Salman .\n\u201c While a part of the condolence is to share in the sadness of the occasion , the other and arguably more important part is a re-commitment among friends , \u201d said Jim Smith , Obama \u2019 s former ambassador to Riyadh . The Saudi monarch \u2019 s repression and human rights violations continue to trouble senior Obama officials . Saudi Arabia has provided critical intelligence about terrorism , helping foil a pair of Yemen-based Al Qaeda plots against U.S.-bound airliners in 2010 and 2012 and hosting a secret U.S. base for drone strikes against the terror group .\nBut some experts and officials worry about the long-term effects of what Human Rights Watch calls \u201c arrests , trials and convictions of peaceful dissidents \u201d seeking political reforms .\nObama himself has alluded to the concern , warning in a 2011 address that Arab societies \u201c held together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time , but they are built upon fault lines that will eventually tear asunder . \u201d\nObama was even more blunt as an Illinois state senator in his famous October 2002 speech opposing the Iraq War .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle East , the Saudis and the Egyptians , stop oppressing their own people , and suppressing dissent , and tolerating corruption and inequality , and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education , without prospects , without hope , the ready recruits of terrorist cells , \u201d Obama told a Chicago crowd .\nAs president , however , Obama has prioritized issues like security and the economy in his dealings with foreign allies like Saudi Arabia , Egypt and China , despite their dubious human rights records . In November 2013 , for instance , Secretary of State John Kerry dodged a chance to criticize the Saudi ban on female drivers , saying that \u201c [ i ] t \u2019 s up to Saudi Arabia to make its own decisions about its own social structure . \u2026 There \u2019 s a healthy debate in Saudi Arabia about this issue , but I think that debate is best left to Saudi Arabia . \u201d\nFor Obama , pressing Salman on rights and reform won \u2019 t be any easier than it was with Abdullah . Saudi Arabia \u2019 s neighbor , Yemen , has descended into dangerous chaos . And the U.S. is about to begin a new Saudi-based training program for moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIL .
