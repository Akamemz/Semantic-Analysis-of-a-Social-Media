    "content_original": "President Obama named Susan Rice as his national security adviser on Wednesday, despite persistent criticism from Republicans over her initial account of the Benghazi terror attack.\n\nObama, speaking in the Rose Garden, called Rice a \"tireless advocate\" for advancing America's interests.\n\n\"She is at once passionate and pragmatic,\" Obama said.\n\nRice will replace Tom Donilon, who is resigning from the post.
