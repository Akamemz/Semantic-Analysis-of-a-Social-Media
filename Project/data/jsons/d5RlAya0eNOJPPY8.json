    "content": "The United Nations Security Council is watching the greatest global health crisis in a century unfold from the sidelines , quarreling over the wisdom of working online , batting down proposals to help organize the response to the pandemic , and largely ignoring the U.N. secretary-general \u2019 s appeal for a global cease-fire .\nThe paralysis comes at a time when the United States is pressing the 15-nation council to adopt a resolution that would largely blame China for unleashing the pathogen on the world . The initiative\u2014which appears to be part of a broader U.S. strategy to deflect responsibility for its own sluggish response to the spread of the virus\u2014is certain to be blocked by China , which wields veto power .\nThe council \u2019 s inaction marks a stark contrast from the Security Council \u2019 s previous response to international threats , from al Qaeda \u2019 s 9/11 attack on the United States to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa . During that health crisis , the Obama administration rallied the council behind a plan to flood the region with medical workers and to shift the mandate of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in the region\u2014working with the support of the U.S. military\u2014to help contain the spread of disease , which killed over 10,000 people .\nIn an effort to fill the current political vacuum , U.N.
