Cory Booker published Thursday morning in supposed defiance of Senate rules had already been cleared for release .\n\u201c All of this drama this morning apparently was for nothing and it \u2019 s unfortunate , \u201d Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , told reporters after a chaotic start to the third day of Kavanaugh \u2019 s hearing .\nEarlier Thursday , Booker dramatically said he would \u201c knowingly \u201d violate Senate rules to release emails marked `` committee confidential '' that showed Kavanaugh discussing racial profiling as a White House lawyer in 2002 . Booker referred to his actions as an act of \u201c civil disobedience \u201d and said he was prepared to face punishment .\n\u201c I am going to release the e-mail about racial profiling and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate , \u201d said Booker , a possible 2020 Democratic candidate for president .\nAt another point , Booker said , \u201c This is about the closest I 'll probably ever have in my life to an , \u2018 I am Spartacus \u2019 moment . \u201d\nBut it turns out , Booker didn \u2019 t actually break any rules with that release . The Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said they worked with the George W. Bush library and the Justice Department overnight to clear the emails . The restrictions were waived early Thursday morning .\n\u201c We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker \u2019 s staff asked us to , \u201d said Bill Burck , a lawyer for Bush involved in the release of documents . \u201c We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker \u2019 s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly . ''\n`` Apparently , some just wanted to break the rules and make a scene , but didn \u2019 t check their email , '' a spokesman for committee Republicans said in a statement . The committee posted the same documents .\n`` Clearly , he is running for president , '' GOP Sen. John Thune later told Fox News , speaking of Booker .\nA spokeswoman for Booker said the lawmaker and Senate Democrats \u201c were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night \u2019 s documents publicly available. \u201d But she did not address when Booker first learned the materials had been cleared .\n\u201c Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents , and that \u2019 s exactly what he \u2019 s done , \u201d Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said .\nLater Thursday , speaking to Fox News , Booker still insisted he violated the rules of the Senate .\n\u201c I released the documents last night by reading from them in violation of the Senate rules , \u201d he said .\nFurther , he posted even more emails via Twitter later Thursday afternoon which may have been designated `` confidential . ''\nThe emails related to Kavanaugh 's comments on racial profiling appeared to be cleared in part because of the involvement of Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve said it before and I \u2019 ll say it again : I will happily work with any of my colleagues from across the aisle to go through the necessary steps and processes to try and get specific classified documents released to the public , \u201d Lee tweeted .\nBooker released 12 pages of emails \u2013 which had been marked \u201c committee confidential \u201d \u2013 online for the public to read . The emails included internal post-9/11 discussions surrounding issues of racial profiling .\nIn a 2002 email , Kavanaugh , who was working as a lawyer in the Bush White House , said he \u201c generally \u201d favored race-neutral security measures , but said they need to \u201c grapple \u201d with the \u201c interim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehensive race-neutral system is developed and implemented . \u201d\nKavanaugh wrote that the \u201c interim question \u201d is of \u201c critical importance to the security of the airlines and American people in the next 6 months or so , especially given Al Qaeda \u2019 s track record of timing between terrorist incidents . \u201d\nThe episode began a day earlier when Booker first implied Kavanaugh had been open to racial profiling tactics , citing the email exchange between Kavanaugh and a colleague .\nHowever , Booker at the time did not provide Kavanaugh a copy of the emails to review while questioning him about it , prompting an objection from Lee , who charged that it was inappropriate to \u201c cross-examine \u201d Kavanaugh about documents that he \u201c can \u2019 t see . \u201d\nThe emails had been marked `` committee confidential . '' But Booker said Thursday he would release them anyway , saying the document is a \u201c great illustration of the absurdity of the process \u201d because there \u2019 s nothing in it that \u2019 s \u201c national security-related . \u201d\n\u201c Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate or of confidentiality of the documents that we are privy to , \u201d Cornyn told Booker , before he was informed there was no violation .\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , dinged Booker for repeating his point .\n\u201c Can I ask you how long you \u2019 re going to say the same thing three or four times ? \u201d Grassley asked .\n\u201c I \u2019 m saying I \u2019 m knowingly violating the rules , \u201d Booker replied . \u201c Senator Cornyn has called me out for it . \u201d\n\u201c How many times are you going to tell us that ? \u201d Grassley replied .\nCornyn , at one point , read the Senate rule that said senators who disclose confidential business could suffer expulsion from the body .\nA number of Democrats , including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , threw their support behind Booker \u2019 s move .\n\u201c I completely agree with you . I concur with what you are doing\u2026So if there is going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey , count me in , \u201d Durbin said .\n\u201c We support what Sen. Booker is doing here , \u201d Klobuchar said .\nMeanwhile , outbursts from protesters continued to interrupt the proceedings , as they have all week .\n\u201c Confirmation hearings are supposed to be an opportunity for the American people to hear from the nominee , '' Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , said . `` Unfortunately , it seems that some on the political left have decided to try to turn this hearing into a circus . \u201d\nIt came as Kavanaugh entered the final stretch of questioning in his confirmation hearing Thursday with Democrats springing a series of cryptic questions \u2013 in an apparent attempt to box the nominee into an embarrassing admission or at least throw him off what has been a relatively steady performance .\nUnder questioning , Kavanaugh denied that he once suggested the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion rights is not settled law . Kavanaugh has repeatedly described the abortion ruling as important Supreme Court precedent difficult to overturn .\nKavanaugh was asked about a 2003 email which was disclosed Thursday , where he wrote : `` I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent , and three current Justices on the Court would do so . ''\nKavanaugh said he was not discussing his views , but rather `` what legal scholars might say . ''\nOther lines of questioning from Democrats have been more mysterious , suggesting an effort to lay a trap .\nIn an especially combative moment late Wednesday , Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif. , asked Kavanaugh whether he ever had discussed Special Counsel Robert Mueller or his Russia probe with anyone at Kasowitz Benson Torres , the law firm founded by Marc Kasowitz , a former personal attorney to President Trump .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t recall any conversations of that kind with anyone at that law firm\u2026 I haven \u2019 t had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone , \u201d Kavanaugh said Thursday , when given the chance to elaborate on Harris ' question from a day earlier .\nHe added , \u201c I \u2019 ve never given anyone any hints , forecasts , previews , winks , nothing about my view as a judge or how I would rule as a judge on that or anything related to that . \u201d\nFor the most part , the hearings have focused on Kavanaugh \u2019 s writings and , in particular , key opinions he authored while serving on the nation \u2019 s most prestigious appellate court .\nThe confirmation hearing has been chaotic at times , with Democrats trying to delay the proceedings as they complain they haven \u2019 t received enough records from Kavanaugh \u2019 s past work .\nKavanaugh served for more than a decade on the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals and , before that , for five years as a lawyer in the White House Counsel \u2019 s office in the George W. Bush administration . He also worked for independent counsel Ken Starr for three years during the probe that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton .\nKavanaugh \u2019 s elevation from the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court would mark a generational rightward shift on the Supreme Court , raising the stakes beyond those of last year \u2019 s nomination of Neil Gorsuch .\nThe judge \u2019 s nomination , though , will ultimately succeed or fail depending on a handful of swing-vote senators , including vulnerable red-state Democrats and moderate pro-choice Republicans who have all said that they would withhold judgment on the nominee .\nRepublicans command a narrow 51-49 Senate majority . Party leaders have said they hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed by a floor vote by early October , when the next Supreme Court term begins .",
