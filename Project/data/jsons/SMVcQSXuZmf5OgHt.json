He \u2019 s against abortion and for gun rights . And in an area that pulses with religious feeling , many say Mr. Trump is the pro-Christian choice , whatever his personal behavior . They don \u2019 t see any 2020 Democrat who might win them back .\nNow this coal-rich region is experiencing change similar to the rest of the region . True , many voters still pull the lever for Democratic local officials . They \u2019 ve opposed the state \u2019 s Republican senior senator , Mitch McConnell , the last two times he \u2019 s run . But many voters here love President Donald Trump .\nThat \u2019 s because east Kentucky Democrats are perhaps Democrats from another era . Their partisanship is part of their geographic identity , handed down from mother to son . Most Southern Democrats flipped to the GOP during the civil rights era \u2013 but not this region . That \u2019 s because it was heavily white to begin with , and civil rights just wasn \u2019 t a big issue , say political scientists .\nIn seven counties of eastern Kentucky , Democratic voters vastly outnumber Republicans \u2013 by as much as 6 to 1 . But in 2016 candidate Donald Trump swept the area by large margins . In 2020 it \u2019 s quite likely he \u2019 ll do so again .\nEarl Kinner Jr. chuckles , imagining what his father would say .\nHis father , Earl Kinner Sr. , bought the Licking Valley Courier in the mid-1940s to cover local news in West Liberty , a town of fewer than 4,000 on the banks of the Licking River . Mr. Kinner Sr. was clear that his paper would lean left . No one was surprised . West Liberty had been a Democratic town for as long as anyone could remember .\nIn some important ways it still is . Like land , accents , and professions , political identity is passed down through generations here . Eastern Kentuckians like Mr. Kinner Jr. call themselves Democrats to this day because their fathers , grandfathers , and great-grandfathers were Democrats : the party of the workingman .\nBut in recent years this tradition has confronted a new political reality . As the economy got worse for Kentucky Democrats ( as they call themselves ) over the last two decades , it seems like Washington Democrats ( as they call them ) just got louder about guns and abortion \u2013 two issues that already put Kentucky Democrats on the fringe of the party .\nSo prior to the 2016 presidential election , Mr. Kinner , who took over the Courier from his father more than three decades ago , found himself writing opinion pieces from his one-room newsroom in support of a New York real estate tycoon running as a Republican .\nThe tycoon promised to bring back the coal industry , eastern Kentucky \u2019 s economic mainstay . He was on the region \u2019 s side of social issues like abortion and seemed to talk their language of Christian faith .\nEastern Kentucky Democrats like Mr. Kinner say that in 2016 they finally found a conservative Democrat they could support : Donald Trump . Candidate Trump swept the region . Voters here say that so far , there \u2019 s no 2020 Democratic candidate that can win them back .\n\u201c The Democratic Party leadership in Washington has left \u2013 just completely left \u2013 people like us , \u201d says Mr. Kinner . \u201c We \u2019 re no longer a priority . \u201d\nTo a Democratic Party staffer flipping through statistics at a desk in Washington , there is a core area of rural eastern Kentucky that appears as if it might be fruitful territory in the 2020 presidential election .\nIn the seven counties that make up this area \u2013 Morgan , home to Mr. Kinner \u2019 s Licking Valley Courier ; Nicholas , Bath , Menifee , Rowan , Elliott , and Wolfe \u2013 Democratic registered voters vastly outnumber Republican ones , sometimes by margins of 6 to 1 . All seven counties voted against Kentucky GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell , the Senate majority leader , when he last ran for reelection in 2014 . They all voted against Senator McConnell in his race before that , in 2008 , as well .\nBut President Donald Trump swept the area in 2016 . More than two-thirds of Morgan County voted Trump , for instance .\nSome of the counties have gone Republican at the presidential level in the past , so in that sense weren \u2019 t a big surprise . But Elliott County had voted Democratic in every presidential ballot since the county was organized in 1869 . It voted for President Barack Obama twice .\nIn 2016 Elliott County voted for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by 70.1 % to 25.9 % .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been a Democrat since I was old enough to register , \u201d says Mike Reynolds , a maintenance lineman , as he finishes his lunch in the Frosty Freeze , a landmark in the town of Sandy Hook . \u201c And I \u2019 ll vote for Trump again . \u201d\nStory Hinckley/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Elliott County has voted for a Democratic president in every election since its founding 150 years ago . But in 2016 , more than 70 % of its 7,500 residents voted for Donald Trump .\nIn Elliott County the biggest town is Sandy Hook , and in Sandy Hook , the biggest spot is the Frosty Freeze : a wood-paneled diner offering four varieties of fried potatoes . Diners filter in and out , greeting each other by their first names . It \u2019 s open seven days a week , 365 days a year , says Mr. Reynolds .\nBut he quickly corrects himself . Actually , he says to clarify , it \u2019 s closed on Christmas .\nSo , why did the few thousand residents of this small county vote against 147 years of tradition in 2016 ? The Obama era is what changed people , says Mr. Reynolds .\n\u201c The coal really hurt us , then throw guns and abortion in and it \u2019 s game over , \u201d says Mr. Reynolds .\nThe area \u2019 s pipefitters and boilermakers are now also out of business , he says , with nearby factories closing in recent years .\nAs Mr. Reynolds talks about his recent voting history during his lunch break at the Frosty Freeze , it seems to parallel with Elliott County \u2019 s larger shift . In 2008 Mr. Reynolds voted for President Obama , who won more than 60 % of the county that year . In 2012 , unhappy with Obama \u2019 s first term but not ready to vote for a Republican , Mr. Reynolds decided not to vote as Mr. Obama eked out a second victory .\nThen in 2016 , for the first time in his life , Mr. Reynolds voted for a Republican presidential candidate . And Mr. Trump won Elliott County with 70 % of the vote .\nSOURCE : Atlas of U.S .

That dynamic never quite took hold in Kentucky , says Mr. Cross . He suspects it \u2019 s because of the all-white population of Kentucky in general , and eastern Kentucky in particularly .
