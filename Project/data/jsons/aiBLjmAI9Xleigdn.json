Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena , including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House , shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House \u2019 s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President . \u201d\n\u201c The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression , as well as any efforts to cover up these matters , \u201d the letter continues , with increasingly loaded language .\n\u201c Our inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the President in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President . A growing public record , including your own statements , indicate that the President , you , and others appear to have pressed the Ukrainian government to pursue two politically -motivated investigations . The first is a prosecution of Ukrainians who provided evidence against Mr. Trump \u2019 s convicted campaign chairman , Paul Manafort . The second relates to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who is challenging President Trump for the presidency in 2020 .\n\u201c For example , on September 19 , 2019 , you admitted on national television that you personally asked the government of Ukraine to target Vice President Biden . During an interview on CNN , Chris Cuomo asked you , \u2018 Sir , you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden ? \u2019 You responded , \u2018 Of course I did. \u2019 In addition to this stark admission , you stated more recently that you are in possession of evidence\u2014in the form of text messages , phone records , and other communications\u2014indicating that you were not acting along and that other Trump Administration officials may have been involved in this scheme . The subpoena requires you to produce all of those communications , and other related documents , to the Commmittees in order to determine the full extent of this effort by the President and his Administration to press Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 presidential election . \u201d\nThe letter concludes by ordering Giuliani to contact staff for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \u201c to arrange for the production of documents . \u201d\nThough Democrats are accusing Trump of trying to \u201c cover up \u201d his July 25 call to his Ukrainian counterpart , which Trump has repeatedly defended as a \u201c perfect \u201d call , Trump authorized release of the transcript of the call last week . In the call , Trump asked Zelensky to \u201c look into \u201d the alleged corruption scandal involving the Ukraine-based company Burisma Holdings that hired Hunter Biden just weeks after his father was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to oversee Ukraine-U.S. relations . Biden eventually used the threat of withholding $ 1 billion in aid to Ukraine to force the removal of the country \u2019 s top prosecutor , who had been investigating Burisma for alleged corruption .\n\u201c I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down , and that \u2019 s really unfair , \u201d Trump told Zelensky , according to the transcript of the call . \u201c A lot of people are talking about that , the way they shut your very good prosecutor down and you had some very bad people involved . Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man . He was the mayor of New York City , a great mayor , and I would like him to call you . I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General . Rudy very much knows what \u2019 s happening and he is a very capable guy . If you could speak to him that would be great .
