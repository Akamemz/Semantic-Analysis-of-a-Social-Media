    "content": "CNN had a weird Friday night after Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his Russia investigation and delivered his report . Analyst Jeffrey Toobin repeatedly had to explain to viewers and fellow contributors that , yes , the investigation really is over and no , there are no arrests forthcoming .\nBut it was n't just the contributors and analysts , Democrats from the House and Senate appeared on CNN to discuss the implications of the report and their reactions to it , among them Rep. Eric Swalwell of California , also known as `` the Starbucks Martyr . ''\nSwalwell was noticeably angry in the wake of the report , and the reporting about the report , and testily told CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer how angry he was about President Trump never going under oath before the investigation . He also said that Trump will `` taint '' the report by looking at it , that they ca n't take Attorney General Barr 's `` word for it '' when it comes to conclusions in the report , and , most amazingly , that we should n't even listen to any response from Trump , and that such response should be `` deemed irrelevant . ''\nBlitzer pressed Swalwell on why the congress should get the report before or to the exclusion of the executive branch , and that 's when the temper kicked in .\n`` The president is a subject . He 's a subject of an investigation , '' said Swalwell . `` There is an honor code that presidents when they are subject to investigations back off but they followed the rule of law . It is inappropriate he would even touch this . ''\n`` If he did n't do anything wrong he would keep his hands off of it , say the public can read every word , every sentence , every comma , every period . He 's not going to do that . I think it will taint its release , '' said Swalwell . This is a Democrat member of congress stating in advance that the report will be `` tainted '' , laying the groundwork to not accept it . A trial balloon ?\nBlitzer then asked the angry congressman if he has confidence in Barr to give congress the maximum amount of detail from the report that he legally can . Swalwell answered that he could trust but verify , and dismissed the caveat about what is permissible under the law by saying that Democrats `` outnumber '' the president and can subpoena what they want .\n`` I also think we 'll have to hear from Bob Mueller himself . I do n't know how we could just accept it at Mr. Barr 's word without the lead investigator telling us whether he was limited in any way , '' said Swalwell . Rep. Adam Schiff on Friday already floated the idea of a subpoena for Mueller .\nSwalwell added without prompting by Blitzer that Trump 's opinion and comments about the report about him and his campaign , which followed a two-year investigation into him and his associates and family and campaign , should be considered irrelevant .\n`` I just want to say this , Wolf . I do not want to hear from a president who was unwilling to go under oath as a subject of this investigation , attack a report where others so willingly did go under oath , '' said Swalwell . `` He has no credibility . The state of the evidence will not include his testimony , so anything he says about it I think should be deemed irrelevant . ''\nLater in the exchange Blitzer notes that if there are no indictments forthcoming the Justice Department guideline is that you do n't `` release negative information about someone who is in charge .
