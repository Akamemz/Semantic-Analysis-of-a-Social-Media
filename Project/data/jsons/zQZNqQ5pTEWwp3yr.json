    "content": "Former FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s new book will be released next week . It \u2019 s already causing a buzz in the D.C. swamp . Both sides have vilified Comey . The Right thinks Comey should have prosecuted Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information , which was sent through her private , unsecure , and unauthorized email server . Clinton used this for all official business as out secretary of state . The Left thinks the email probe is what caused Hillary to lose , especially when the embattled director informed Congress that emails from then-Secretary Clinton were found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , husband to Hillary top aide Huma Abedin .\nIn the book , he described President Trump as mafia boss , who is \u201c untethered to truth \u201d ( via AP ) :\nFormer FBI Director James Comey blasts President Donald Trump as unethical and \u201c untethered to truth \u201d and calls his leadership of the country \u201c ego driven and about personal loyalty \u201d in a forthcoming book . Comey reveals new details about his interactions with Trump and his own decision-making in handling the Hillary Clinton email investigation before the 2016 election . He casts Trump as a mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference . The book adheres closely to Comey \u2019 s public testimony and written statements about his contacts with the president during the early days of the administration and his growing concern about the president \u2019 s integrity . It also includes strikingly personal jabs at Trump that appear likely to irritate the president . The 6-foot-8 Comey describes Trump as shorter than he expected with a \u201c too long \u201d tie and \u201c bright white half-moons \u201d under his eyes that he suggests came from tanning goggles . He also says he made a conscious effort to check the president \u2019 s hand size , saying it was \u201c smaller than mine , but did not seem unusually so. \u201d The book , \u201c A Higher Loyalty , \u201d is to be released next week . The Associated Press purchased a copy this week .\nThe New York Timeswent a bit further detailing the book , namely his reactions to former top Bush officials , and his annoyance with former Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who more than hinted that Comey should refer to the Hillary email probe as a \u201c matter \u201d and not an investigation , which it was\u2014but there was something else he admitted that was bound to set off liberals [ emphasis mine ] :\nA Higher Loyalty \u201d also provides sharp sketches of key players in three presidential administrations . Comey draws a scathing portrait of Vice President Dick Cheney \u2019 s legal adviser David S. Addington , who spearheaded the arguments of many hard-liners in the George W. Bush White House ; Comey describes their point of view : \u201c The war on terrorism justified stretching , if not breaking , the written law. \u201d He depicts Bush national security adviser and later Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as uninterested in having a detailed policy discussion of interrogation policy and the question of torture . He takes Barack Obama \u2019 s attorney general Loretta Lynch to task for asking him to refer to the Clinton email case as a \u201c matter , \u201d not an \u201c investigation. \u201d ( Comey tartly notes that \u201c the F.B.I . didn \u2019 t do \u2018 matters. \u2019 \u201d ) And he compares Trump \u2019 s attorney general , Jeff Sessions , to Alberto R. Gonzales , who served in the same position under Bush , writing that both were \u201c overwhelmed and overmatched by the job , \u201d but \u201c Sessions lacked the kindness Gonzales radiated. \u201d Comey is what Saul Bellow called a \u201c first-class noticer. \u201d He notices , for instance , \u201c the soft white pouches under \u201d Trump \u2019 s \u201c expressionless blue eyes \u201d ; coyly observes that the president \u2019 s hands are smaller than his own \u201c but did not seem unusually so \u201d ; and points out that he never saw Trump laugh \u2014 a sign , Comey suspects , of his \u201c deep insecurity , his inability to be vulnerable or to risk himself by appreciating the humor of others , which , on reflection , is really very sad in a leader , and a little scary in a president. \u201d [ \u2026 ] As for his controversial disclosure on Oct. 28 , 2016 , 11 days before the election , that the F.B.I . was reviewing more Clinton emails that might be pertinent to its earlier investigation , Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinton was going to win . He has repeatedly asked himself , he writes , whether he was influenced by that assumption : \u201c It is entirely possible that , because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president , my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls . But I don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nYeah , the head of our nation \u2019 s preeminent federal domestic law enforcement agency decided to uphold the rule of law by polling . That \u2019 s messed up , though liberals seem to be more incensed . Our friends at Twitchy caught some good reactions :\nthe only thing more infuriating than Comey refusing to acknowledge his role in Trump 's presidency is Comey acknowledging it and not giving a shit https : //t.co/wOke3wxEgg \u2014 Ashley Feinberg ( @ ashleyfeinberg ) April 12 , 2018\nNeedless to say , when I worked did Janet Reno , she never consulted polls before she made decisions on how to handle a criminal case . https : //t.co/V7pyAhB8bg \u2014 Ronald Klain ( @ RonaldKlain ) April 13 , 2018\nBurns it all in a cleansing fire . https : //t.co/sfwtWXYxEl \u2014 jess mcintosh ( @ jess_mc ) April 12 , 2018\nSo basically we have Trump as president because Comey couldn \u2019 t read poll probabilities right ?

In October 2016 , Michael Kortan , who was serving as the FBI 's public affairs chief but has since retired , shared the transcript of Comey 's comments on the Clinton case delivered behind closed doors to special agents in charge .
