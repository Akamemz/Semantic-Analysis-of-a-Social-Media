    "content": "The Obama administration is reportedly considering air strikes in Syria against the terrorist group ISIS . The New York Times quotes \u201c a top national security adviser \u201d to the president as saying the U.S. is \u201c \u2018 not going to be restricted by borders \u2019 to protect its interests\u2026 \u201d\nWhat about American cities ? If ISIS attacks one or more U.S. cities , as it has threatened to do , what then ? We can \u2019 t bomb ourselves . How would we counter a nosedive in the stock market or the ensuing chaos and fear ?\nThe U.S. and Europe are vulnerable because of a false belief that we can somehow \u201c convert \u201d ideological and religious fundamentalists into pluralistic , tolerant people by exposing them to our way of life .\nSo we let them into our nations . They build mosques , often with funding from Saudi Arabia , which practices and teaches a radical brand of Islam known as Wahhabism , and allow them to set up Islamic schools , at least some of which teach hatred of Jews , Christians and Western values .\nFrance has seen its Muslim population explode to more than 8 million , and growing , according to the Gatestone Institute . It is the same in other European nations . While not all of these immigrants are terrorists , no doubt terrorists immigrated along with those looking for a better life , or were radicalized after arriving . Many Muslim immigrants have lived in isolation from Western cultures and values which their faith has taught them to hate .\nAccording to the Pew Research Religion & Public Life Project , \u201c the estimated share of legal Muslim immigrants entering the U.S. each year has roughly doubled , from about 5 percent of legal immigrants in 1992 to about 10 percent in 2012 . \u201d\nWhile it is a diverse group with not all holding to the same ideology or hatred of the West , there are enough radicals among them to constitute a clear and present danger . Groups like the Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) intimidate some politicians and the media with cries of \u201c Islamophobia \u201d whenever anyone warns of the radicals \u2019 agenda .\nAs the Center for Immigration Studies points out , \u201c Since the November 1990 assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane by an Egyptian , the immigrant Muslim community has been associated with a great number of violent incidents \u2014 all these even before the atrocities on September 11 , 2001 . In its long history of immigration , the United States has never encountered so violent-prone and radicalized a community as the Muslims who have arrived since 1965 . \u201d\nSo , if even a small number of Muslim immigrants \u2014 or American citizens who have been radicalized by imams \u2014 attack a shopping mall , killing and terrorizing shoppers , what will the president do ?\nWill he treat it as a crime , \u201c workplace violence , \u201d or call it by its right name ?\nWill civil libertarians have their way in opposing further surveillance of potential and actual radicals , deporting some and stripping others of their U.S. citizenship , if they travel to align themselves with ISIS fighters and try to return to the U.S. ?\nThese and many other questions must be answered before another attack , which our leaders repeatedly warn is coming .\nWhy is it coming ?
