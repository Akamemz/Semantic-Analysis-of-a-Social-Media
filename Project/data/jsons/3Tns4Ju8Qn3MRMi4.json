The vote was 357-60.The one-week measure came after 52 angry conservative and tea party-backed Republicans joined with Democrats to reject a bill Boehner put forth to extend Homeland Security 's funding for three weeks.The 224-203 vote proved to be a stinging rebuke to the speaker , who has represented Ohio in the House since 1991.Boehner , 65 , won election to his third term as House leader in January \u2014 after a small group of conservatives voted against him.The Senate quickly passed the one-week bill on a voice vote after the negative House vote .
