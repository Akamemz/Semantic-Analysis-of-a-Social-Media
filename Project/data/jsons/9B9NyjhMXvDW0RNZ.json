    "content": "Last October , when the Supreme Court began its term , liberals had good reason to be despondent .\nThe Court \u2019 s most recent term , which ended Thursday , was the first full term since Justice Brett Kavanaugh , a staunch conservative , replaced his more moderate predecessor Justice Anthony Kennedy . It was also the first term where Kavanaugh helped select every case that would be heard by the justices .\nBy all outward signs , the Court \u2019 s conservative majority approached its docket like they were children turned loose in a toy store . The Court planned to hear a case that presented an existential threat to the right to an abortion . It seemed likely to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program \u2014 which benefits hundreds of thousands of immigrants \u2014 potentially doing so permanently , so that no future president could revive it . And the Court appeared ready to expand the Second Amendment , a longtime project of Kavanaugh \u2019 s .\nIn the end , the Court took a far more measured approach to each of these cases . The right to terminate a pregnancy survives , although Chief Justice John Roberts signaled pretty clearly that it is unlikely to survive much longer . DACA also survives , although only due to a paperwork error that the Trump administration may correct . The guns case ended , not with a bang but with a whimper .\nThis is still an extremely conservative Supreme Court . The just-completed term was a disaster for voting rights . It imposed significant new limits on Congress \u2019 s ability to investigate President Trump . The religious right walked away with several big victories . The Court opened up a new front in the war on Obamacare .\nBut the Court also showed that there is at least some daylight between its interpretations of the law and the policy preferences of the Republican Party .\nA partial explanation for the liberal victories this term is that conservative advocates got ahead of their skis . As Brendan Nyhan , a professor of government at Dartmouth College , wrote in 2015 \u2014 the last time the Court had a surprisingly liberal term \u2014 \u201c the court \u2019 s recent decisions may reflect a change in the cases being considered by the court rather than a shift in the preferences of the justices . \u201d\nWhen the Court moves rightward , conservative advocates are more likely to bring dubious cases \u2014 and conservative lawmakers are more likely to enact laws of dubious constitutionality \u2014 out of a belief that an ideologically sympathetic Court is likely to rule in their favor . Liberal lawyers , meanwhile , will be more likely to avoid federal court unless they are sure their arguments are airtight . As a result , the Supreme Court will tend to hear weaker claims from conservatives and stronger claims from liberals .\nAdditionally , at least two members of the Court \u2014 Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2014 do not always share the same ideological commitments as their fellow Republican justices . Roberts is less active with movement conservatism than his four most conservative colleagues . And Gorsuch \u2019 s commitment to a particular method of deciding cases sometimes overrides his conservative preferences .\nBecause Republicans control only five of the nine seats on the Supreme Court , conservative advocates often need to win the vote of every single conservative justice in order to prevail . So if either Roberts or Gorsuch is unpersuaded by a conservative argument , that \u2019 s frequently enough to hand a loss to that argument \u2019 s proponents .\nConservatives brought several exceedingly weak cases to the Supreme Court this term\nHere \u2019 s a good rule of thumb for new law school graduates : It \u2019 s a bad idea to make a case that is literally identical to one that you recently lost in the Supreme Court . Yet that \u2019 s more or less what anti-abortion advocates did in June Medical Services v. Russo .\nIn Whole Woman \u2019 s Health v. Hellerstedt ( 2016 ) , the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law requiring abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital \u2014 a credential that is very difficult for abortion doctors to obtain and that does little or nothing to improve health outcomes . June Medical asked the Supreme Court to uphold a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital . As Justice Stephen Breyer noted in his June Medical opinion , the two laws were \u201c almost word-for-word identical . \u201d\nConservatives undoubtedly hoped that , with Kennedy , who joined the majority in Whole Woman \u2019 s Health , no longer on the Court , they could get a different outcome in an interchangeable case . But Roberts was unwilling to endorse such an attempt to treat his Court as a purely political body . \u201c The result in this case is controlled by our decision four years ago invalidating a nearly identical Texas law , \u201d Roberts concluded in an opinion that reluctantly agreed to strike down the Louisiana law .\nMuch of Roberts \u2019 s opinion laid out his objections to the Court \u2019 s existing abortion rights cases , so Roberts remains likely to uphold significant restrictions on abortion in the future . He \u2019 s just not willing to uphold the exact same law that the Court struck down a few years earlier .\nSimilar things can be said about Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California , where Roberts joined his four liberal colleagues in holding that the Trump administration didn \u2019 t complete the proper paperwork when it decided to terminate the DACA program , which allows nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants to live and work in the United States . The nation \u2019 s highest court typically does not exist to excuse high-level government officials who do not want to do their homework .\nIf the Trump administration wanted to end DACA , it should have just fixed its paperwork error , rather than spending years litigating this case through the federal court system .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Trump v. Vance , where the Supreme Court held that the president of the United States does not enjoy total immunity from state criminal investigations . Many of Trump \u2019 s legal arguments in this case were so absurd that they bordered on self-parody .\nHere is Trump 's lawyer , William Consovoy , telling Judge Denny Chin that if Trump were to shoot someone on fifth avenue , he could not be criminally investigated while in office .\nVery normal argument . pic.twitter.com/xlDBwmCUnR \u2014 Erick Fernandez ( @ ErickFernandez ) October 23 , 2019\nNone of this means that conservative lawyers have nothing to gain from bringing audacious arguments to a conservative Court . Twenty years ago , many justices believed that it is unconstitutional for the government to fund religious schools . But in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue , the Supreme Court held this term that states are required to fund such schools if they provide similar funding to secular private schools .\nSimilarly , in Trump v. Mazars , the president sought new protections against congressional immunity that were entirely at odds with existing precedents . He won anyway , although the Court didn \u2019 t go quite as far as Trump \u2019 s lawyers asked it to go .\nNor did conservatives really lose anything meaningful in June Medical , Regents , or Vance . Roberts is still likely to uphold nearly any anti-abortion law that \u2019 s brought before him . The paperwork error in Regents can be cured . And Vance largely just maintained a status quo that says the president isn \u2019 t completely above the law .\nBut if conservatives ask for too much , too fast from this Supreme Court , they will eventually find the justices \u2019 limits .\nRoberts is very conservative , but he \u2019 s divorced himself somewhat from the conservative movement\nIn the fall of 2007 , Chief Justice Roberts had just celebrated the second anniversary of his appointment as the nation \u2019 s highest-ranking judge when he delivered the \u201c 7th Annual Barbara K. Olson Memorial Lecture \u201d to the conservative Federalist Society . According to the society \u2019 s website , that was the last time the chief justice spoke to this organization , which forms the locus of legal conservatism within the United States .\nIn this sense , Roberts is quite unlike his four Republican colleagues . Justices Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito , Neil Gorsuch , and Brett Kavanaugh are all frequent speakers at the Federalist Society \u2019 s events \u2014 both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh took a victory lap at the society \u2019 s annual black-tie dinner not long after their confirmation to the Supreme Court . Indeed , the Court \u2019 s rightmost justices frequently attend this dinner even when they are not on the speaking program and are just there to enjoy a meal with friends .\nIt \u2019 s hard to minimize the importance of the Federalist Society , which plays an outsize role in selecting President Trump \u2019 s judicial nominees , and in maintaining ideological discipline among conservative legal elites .\nResearch shows that sitting justices are \u201c very prestige hungry \u201d and they \u201c care a lot about their reputations , \u201d according to Maya Sen , a professor at Harvard \u2019 s Kennedy School of Government who studies the Supreme Court . The justices , Sen told me , \u201c want to be viewed well by their peers \u201d within the elite echelons of the legal profession , a privileged cohort that includes many \u201c liberal academics . \u201d\nThe Federalist Society , moreover , was born out of many conservative legal elites \u2019 perception that their ideas were not taken seriously within the legal profession and especially within academia . As then-Solicitor General Ted Olson told the Federalist Society in 2002 , \u201c the best measure of our success is the sound of gnashing teeth and lamentations by those who feel threatened \u201d \u2014 he then proposed a toast to the society \u201c for sowing such delightful despair among the legal , political and academic establishment . \u201d\nAt the same event , Federalist Society president Eugene B. Meyer complained that conservatives on law school campuses \u201c have trouble finding faculty advisers \u201d and that \u201c certain ideas are not being heard in law schools . \u201d\nThe Federalist Society , according to Sen , creates a \u201c safe space \u201d for conservative lawyers \u2014 up to and including sitting Supreme Court justices \u2014 where they can feel professionally validated without having to seek such validation from the kind of liberal thinkers who often fill the pages of the Harvard Law Review .\nThe society succeeds not just by doling out plum jobs to loyal conservatives , but also by satiating its members \u2019 very human need to feel loved and respected by their professional colleagues \u2014 by surrounding those members with colleagues who love and respect people who advance conservative causes .\nAmanda Hollis-Brusky , a politics professor at Pomona College and the author of Ideas with Consequences : The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution , agreed that Roberts \u2019 s apparent distance from the Federalist Society distinguishes him from his fellow Republican justices , but she added that she \u2019 s not sure if Roberts \u2019 s cooler relationship with the powerful conservative organization is a \u201c cause or an effect \u201d of the fact that he sometimes votes to the left of justices like Alito or Kavanaugh .\nHollis-Brusky pointed to Roberts \u2019 s vote to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius ( 2012 ) as the \u201c first time that Roberts deviated from what was clearly the Federalist Society \u2019 s preferred outcome. \u201d Roberts \u2019 s decision to keep Obamacare alive , she says , may have created a rift between the chief justice and the society .\nOnce a rift forms , it can be self-reinforcing . Roberts \u2019 s vote at NFIB may have alienated him from conservative legal elites , but that makes it less likely that he \u2019 ll seek validation from them in the future , which in turn makes it less likely that he \u2019 ll vote with his fellow Republicans .\nHollis-Brusky also pointed to another factor that may drive Roberts \u2019 s occasional flirtations with the left . Justice Kennedy , she noted , voted more conservatively when Justice Sandra Day O \u2019 Connor was the Court \u2019 s \u201c swing \u201d justice \u2014 the justice in the Court \u2019 s ideological center \u2014 than he did when Kennedy took up the \u201c mantle \u201d of the swing vote . It \u2019 s possible that Roberts feels the same pressure now that he \u2019 s at the Court \u2019 s center . And this pressure may be accentuated because of his role as chief justice .\nIt is , after all , the \u201c Roberts Court , \u201d not the \u201c Alito Court \u201d or the \u201c Kavanaugh Court , \u201d that historians will write about if this age is remembered as an era of unbridled judicial partisanship .\nYet , whatever the reason for Roberts \u2019 s relative moderation , there are some outward signs that Roberts \u2019 s own Republican colleagues view him as an unsteady ally .\nWhen the term began , New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York appeared likely to be a landmark Second Amendment case that would expand the scope of that amendment well beyond its current bounds , but the case fizzled due to a jurisdictional problem and wound up having little to say about gun rights .\nJustices Thomas , Alito , Gorsuch , and Kavanaugh have all , at various times , called for the Court to take a more expansive approach to the Second Amendment . And , when the New York State Rifle case reached its anticlimactic conclusion , Kavanaugh even called upon his Court to take up \u201c one of the several Second Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending before the Court. \u201d The Court decided to turn away all these cases .\nIt only takes four votes for the Court to hear a case , which means that Thomas , Alito , Gorsuch , and Kavanaugh could have joined together to hear any case they wanted . It \u2019 s likely they decided not to hear another guns case because they were unsure if Roberts was on their side .\nIn several other cases , Justice Alito did not hide his rage at decisions where Roberts joined the liberals . He claimed that the June Medical decision \u201c twists the law. \u201d And , in an unusually angry dissent , Alito described a landmark LGBTQ rights decision , which Roberts joined , as \u201c deceptive \u201d and \u201c preposterous . \u201d\nNone of which means that Roberts isn \u2019 t an extremely conservative justice . On voting rights , in particular , he is as doctrinaire a conservative as they come . He joined several decisions this term that will make it difficult \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 for many voters to cast a ballot during the Covid-19 pandemic .\nBut Roberts , according to Hollis-Brusky , also appears concerned that his Court should not appear to be the \u201c handmaiden of the Trump administration . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that he \u2019 s become a raging liberal , by any means , \u201d said Hollis-Brusky , but at least he can claim that \u201c he \u2019 s beholden to no one . \u201d\nJustice Neil Gorsuch , meanwhile , voted with the liberal justices in two major cases : Bostock v. Clayton County , which held that the federal ban on \u201c sex \u201d discrimination in employment encompasses anti-LGBTQ discrimination ; and McGirt v. Oklahoma , which establishes that a huge swath of land encompassing half the state of Oklahoma is what federal law anachronistically refers to \u201c Indian country \u201d \u2014 Native American reservations where tribal governments retain considerable sovereign authority .\nGorsuch is much more conservative than Roberts . Indeed , on some important issues , he is probably the most conservative justice to sit on the Supreme Court since the Great Depression . But Gorsuch is also one of the Court \u2019 s proudest evangelists for \u201c textualism , \u201d the belief that , in his words , a law should be read according to its \u201c ordinary meaning at the time of its enactment. \u201d And his commitment to this method of interpreting federal laws sometimes overcomes his commitment to conservatism .\nFrom a textualist perspective , Bostock was an easy case . As Shannon Minter , legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , told me , \u201c if it were possible ( which of course it \u2019 s not ) to disregard the fraught social and political context of the case , Bostock would be an entirely unremarkable decision , doctrinally speaking . \u201d\nThe case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , which prohibits employment discrimination \u201c because of [ an employee \u2019 s ] race , color , religion , sex , or national origin. \u201d As Gorsuch wrote in Bostock , a ban on \u201c sex \u201d discrimination necessarily encompasses anti-LGBTQ discrimination simply as a matter of textual interpretation :\nConsider , for example , an employer with two employees , both of whom are attracted to men . The two individuals are , to the employer \u2019 s mind , materially identical in all respects , except that one is a man and the other a woman . If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men , the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague .\nSimilarly , if an employer \u201c fires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female \u201d but also \u201c retains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth , \u201d that employer is engaged in sex discrimination . \u201c Again , \u201d Gorsuch wrote , \u201c the individual employee \u2019 s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision . \u201d\nYet if you attended the oral argument in R.G . & G.R . Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC , a companion case to Bostock that was argued the same day , you could watch Gorsuch \u2019 s struggle between his textualist methodology and his conservative political views play out in real time . \u201c Assume for the moment I \u2019 m ... with you on the textual evidence , \u201d Gorsuch told the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer arguing in favor of transgender rights . Should courts \u201c take into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed \u201d in a judicial decision prohibiting anti-LGBTQ employment discrimination ?\nUltimately , however , Gorsuch \u2019 s commitment to textualism overcame his apparent belief that LGBTQ equality could trigger \u201c massive social upheaval . \u201d\nA similar dynamic played out in McGirt , where the state of Oklahoma claimed that if half of its lands were held to be tribal reservations , such a decision \u201c would decimate state and local budgets \u201d because \u201c the State generally lacks the authority to tax Indians in Indian country . \u201d\nBut Gorsuch wrote that such consequences are irrelevant . \u201c Dire warnings are just that , \u201d according to Gorsuch \u2019 s majority opinion in McGirt , \u201c and not a license for us to disregard the law . \u201d\nThe fact that Gorsuch is so committed to a particular methodology that he \u2019 s sometimes willing to break with his fellow Republicans is significant , but it would be an enormous mistake for liberals to think of Gorsuch as an ally , or even as a swing vote .\nAt the time of his nomination to the Supreme Court , Sen told me , empirical studies placed Gorsuch at the 85th percentile of conservatism among his colleagues on the federal bench . And this rough empirical measure misses much of the nuance of his opinions .\nWhen Gorsuch swings right , he frequently swings hard to the right . For example , he is the strongest proponent of the \u201c right to contract \u201d \u2014 often a euphemism for employers \u2019 right to exploit their employees \u2014 to sit on the Supreme Court since the Franklin Roosevelt administration . In the past , this discredited \u201c right \u201d was used to strike down minimum wage laws and laws protecting workers \u2019 right to unionize , among many other things , on the theory that the right to contract includes the \u201c right \u201d to agree to be paid insignificant wages , or the \u201c right \u201d to sign away your ability to join a union .\nSo long as the Court \u2019 s current panel of nine justices sits , in other words , conservatives have a lot to gain \u2014 and liberals have a lot to fear \u2014 from the Supreme Court . The lesson of this past term is not that the Court is liberal . It \u2019 s that conservatives can not expect to win every single case they bring , no matter how weak their arguments .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .

Meyer complained that conservatives on law school campuses \u201chave trouble finding faculty advisers\u201d and that \u201ccertain ideas are not being heard in law schools.\u201d\n\nThe Federalist Society, according to Sen, creates a \u201csafe space\u201d for conservative lawyers \u2014 up to and including sitting Supreme Court justices \u2014 where they can feel professionally validated without having to seek such validation from the kind of liberal thinkers who often fill the pages of the Harvard Law Review.\n\nThe society succeeds not just by doling out plum jobs to loyal conservatives, but also by satiating its members\u2019 very human need to feel loved and respected by their professional colleagues \u2014 by surrounding those members with colleagues who love and respect people who advance conservative causes.\n\nAmanda Hollis-Brusky, a politics professor at Pomona College and the author of Ideas with Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution, agreed that Roberts\u2019s apparent distance from the Federalist Society distinguishes him from his fellow Republican justices, but she added that she\u2019s not sure if Roberts\u2019s cooler relationship with the powerful conservative organization is a \u201ccause or an effect\u201d of the fact that he sometimes votes to the left of justices like Alito or Kavanaugh.\n\nHollis-Brusky pointed to Roberts\u2019s vote to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) as the \u201cfirst time that Roberts deviated from what was clearly the Federalist Society\u2019s preferred outcome.\u201d Roberts\u2019s decision to keep Obamacare alive, she says, may have created a rift between the chief justice and the society.\n\nOnce a rift forms, it can be self-reinforcing. Roberts\u2019s vote at NFIB may have alienated him from conservative legal elites, but that makes it less likely that he\u2019ll seek validation from them in the future, which in turn makes it less likely that he\u2019ll vote with his fellow Republicans.\n\nHollis-Brusky also pointed to another factor that may drive Roberts\u2019s occasional flirtations with the left. Justice Kennedy, she noted, voted more conservatively when Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was the Court\u2019s \u201cswing\u201d justice \u2014 the justice in the Court\u2019s ideological center \u2014 than he did when Kennedy took up the \u201cmantle\u201d of the swing vote. It\u2019s possible that Roberts feels the same pressure now that he\u2019s at the Court\u2019s center. And this pressure may be accentuated because of his role as chief justice.\n\nIt is, after all, the \u201cRoberts Court,\u201d not the \u201cAlito Court\u201d or the \u201cKavanaugh Court,\u201d that historians will write about if this age is remembered as an era of unbridled judicial partisanship.\n\nYet, whatever the reason for Roberts\u2019s relative moderation, there are some outward signs that Roberts\u2019s own Republican colleagues view him as an unsteady ally.\n\nWhen the term began, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York appeared likely to be a landmark Second Amendment case that would expand the scope of that amendment well beyond its current bounds, but the case fizzled due to a jurisdictional problem and wound up having little to say about gun rights.\n\nJustices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh have all, at various times, called for the Court to take a more expansive approach to the Second Amendment. And, when the New York State Rifle case reached its anticlimactic conclusion, Kavanaugh even called upon his Court to take up \u201cone of the several Second Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending before the Court.\u201d The Court decided to turn away all these cases.\n\nIt only takes four votes for the Court to hear a case, which means that Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh could have joined together to hear any case they wanted. It\u2019s likely they decided not to hear another guns case because they were unsure if Roberts was on their side.\n\nIn several other cases, Justice Alito did not hide his rage at decisions where Roberts joined the liberals. He claimed that the June Medical decision \u201ctwists the law.\u201d And, in an unusually angry dissent, Alito described a landmark LGBTQ rights decision, which Roberts joined, as \u201cdeceptive\u201d and \u201cpreposterous.\u201d\n\nNone of which means that Roberts isn\u2019t an extremely conservative justice. On voting rights, in particular, he is as doctrinaire a conservative as they come. He joined several decisions this term that will make it difficult \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 for many voters to cast a ballot during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Roberts, according to Hollis-Brusky, also appears concerned that his Court should not appear to be the \u201chandmaiden of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s become a raging liberal, by any means,\u201d said Hollis-Brusky, but at least he can claim that \u201che\u2019s beholden to no one.\u201d\n\nGorsuch has competing ideological commitments\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, voted with the liberal justices in two major cases: Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that the federal ban on \u201csex\u201d discrimination in employment encompasses anti-LGBTQ discrimination; and McGirt v. Oklahoma, which establishes that a huge swath of land encompassing half the state of Oklahoma is what federal law anachronistically refers to \u201cIndian country\u201d \u2014 Native American reservations where tribal governments retain considerable sovereign authority.\n\nGorsuch is much more conservative than Roberts. Indeed, on some important issues, he is probably the most conservative justice to sit on the Supreme Court since the Great Depression. But Gorsuch is also one of the Court\u2019s proudest evangelists for \u201ctextualism,\u201d the belief that, in his words, a law should be read according to its \u201cordinary meaning at the time of its enactment.\u201d And his commitment to this method of interpreting federal laws sometimes overcomes his commitment to conservatism.\n\nFrom a textualist perspective, Bostock was an easy case. As Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, told me, \u201cif it were possible (which of course it\u2019s not) to disregard the fraught social and political context of the case, Bostock would be an entirely unremarkable decision, doctrinally speaking.\u201d\n\nThe case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination \u201cbecause of [an employee\u2019s] race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d As Gorsuch wrote in Bostock, a ban on \u201csex\u201d discrimination necessarily encompasses anti-LGBTQ discrimination simply as a matter of textual interpretation:\n\nConsider, for example, an employer with two employees, both of whom are attracted to men. The two individuals are, to the employer\u2019s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman. If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague.\n\nSimilarly, if an employer \u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a male at birth but who now identifies as a female\u201d but also \u201cretains an otherwise identical employee who was identified as female at birth,\u201d that employer is engaged in sex discrimination. \u201cAgain,\u201d Gorsuch wrote, \u201cthe individual employee\u2019s sex plays an unmistakable and impermissible role in the discharge decision.\u201d\n\nYet if you attended the oral argument in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC, a companion case to Bostock that was argued the same day, you could watch Gorsuch\u2019s struggle between his textualist methodology and his conservative political views play out in real time. \u201cAssume for the moment I\u2019m ... with you on the textual evidence,\u201d Gorsuch told the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer arguing in favor of transgender rights. Should courts \u201ctake into consideration the massive social upheaval that would be entailed\u201d in a judicial decision prohibiting anti-LGBTQ employment discrimination?\n\nUltimately, however, Gorsuch\u2019s commitment to textualism overcame his apparent belief that LGBTQ equality could trigger \u201cmassive social upheaval.\u201d\n\nA similar dynamic played out in McGirt, where the state of Oklahoma claimed that if half of its lands were held to be tribal reservations, such a decision \u201cwould decimate state and local budgets\u201d because \u201cthe State generally lacks the authority to tax Indians in Indian country.\u201d\n\nBut Gorsuch wrote that such consequences are irrelevant. \u201cDire warnings are just that,\u201d according to Gorsuch\u2019s majority opinion in McGirt, \u201cand not a license for us to disregard the law.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Gorsuch is so committed to a particular methodology that he\u2019s sometimes willing to break with his fellow Republicans is significant, but it would be an enormous mistake for liberals to think of Gorsuch as an ally, or even as a swing vote.\n\nAt the time of his nomination to the Supreme Court, Sen told me, empirical studies placed Gorsuch at the 85th percentile of conservatism among his colleagues on the federal bench. And this rough empirical measure misses much of the nuance of his opinions.\n\nWhen Gorsuch swings right, he frequently swings hard to the right. For example, he is the strongest proponent of the \u201cright to contract\u201d \u2014 often a euphemism for employers\u2019 right to exploit their employees \u2014 to sit on the Supreme Court since the Franklin Roosevelt administration. In the past, this discredited \u201cright\u201d was used to strike down minimum wage laws and laws protecting workers\u2019 right to unionize, among many other things, on the theory that the right to contract includes the \u201cright\u201d to agree to be paid insignificant wages, or the \u201cright\u201d to sign away your ability to join a union.\n\nSo long as the Court\u2019s current panel of nine justices sits, in other words, conservatives have a lot to gain \u2014 and liberals have a lot to fear \u2014 from the Supreme Court. The lesson of this past term is not that the Court is liberal. It\u2019s that conservatives cannot expect to win every single case they bring, no matter how weak their arguments.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
