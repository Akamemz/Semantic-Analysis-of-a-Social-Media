DHS will have to employ thousands of bureaucrats to process those who `` come forward and register , submit biometric data , pass background checks , pay fees , and show that their child was born before the date of this announcement . `` In addition , applicants will have to prove they have been in the country for at least five years and will have to pay taxes , Gingrich noted . `` Well , a brand new program that hands out three-year work authorizations and processes more paperwork than many state DMVs is not merely saying , as the President put it in his speech , that `` we 're not going to deport you , '' said Gingrich.In addition , the president said his executive action will offer relief to a narrow number of people , but the policy memo says the DHS will `` direct all of its enforcement resources at pursuing '' people who are `` national security threats , serious criminals , and recent border crossers . `` So while one group of 4 million will be eligible for the work authorization program , `` there will be no resources directed at enforcing immigration law against the other 7 million people here illegally as long as they do not fall into a few narrow categories , according to the policy memo.Meanwhile , Gingrich says , Obama is assuring the nation his actions are lawful and the same kind taken by presidents over the past half century.Gingrich says Obama does n't have any congressional sanction like the predecessors he cites and his actions are `` are an order of magnitude larger '' than those previous actions.Gingrich describes the address as `` a Gruber speech , and was designed to sound acceptable , even if it was a lie , a reference to Obamacare co-architect Jonathan Gruber 's statements on how the Obama administration depended on `` the stupidity of the American voter '' to enable the healthcare reform plan . `` Listening to a speech in which the President lied about what he was proposing and lied about his authority to implement it , it was hard not to think of the Gruber model \u2013 which is really the Obama model , after all , '' writes Gingrich . `` He said what he needed to say to do what he wants to do . `` The problem is , in the past few years Obama has described on video 22 times how he does not have the legal and Constitutional authority to enact the reforms he announced Thursday night.In 2011 , Gingrich said , Obama said that there are `` laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President . `` But that has all changed , and `` it 's a shame he apparently thinks , like Gruber , that Americans are all so stupid we wo n't figure out he 's not telling us the truth today , '' Gingrich concluded .",
