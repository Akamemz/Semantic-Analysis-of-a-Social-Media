Two years before , a nationwide study of college graduates had shown that more than a third had made no significant gains in such mental abilities during their four years in school .\nMr. Daniels , a former governor of Indiana , needed to justify the high cost of attending Purdue to its students and their families . After all , the percentage of Americans who say a college degree is \u201c very important \u201d has fallen from 75 percent in 2010 to 44 percent today .\nPurdue now has a pilot test to assess the critical thinking skills of students as they progress .

This week , the results of a nationwide experiment were released showing for the first time that professors can use standardized metrics to assess the actual coursework of students \u2013 across many schools and disciplines \u2013 and measure how well they do in three key areas : critical thinking , written communication , and quantitative literacy .\nThe project involved more than 125 professors judging 7,000 samples of students \u2019 class work from 59 institutions in nine states .
