Negotiations have ground to a standstill .\n`` I 'm not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the top rate from going up for folks in the top 2 percent , '' Obama said during a visit with a middle class family in northern Virginia .\n`` I 'm encouraged to see that there 's been some discussion by Republicans acknowledging the need for additional revenue , '' he said . `` But the only way to get the kind of revenues we need is to modestly increase rates on folks like me . ''\nTreasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , the lead Democratic negotiator in `` cliff '' talks , said Wednesday the administration is `` absolutely '' willing to allow the package of deep automatic spending cuts and across-the-board tax hikes to take effect Jan. 1 if they do n't get some increase in top rates .\nObama spoke by phone with House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday , the first time both men had been in contact in one week . On Monday , Boehner attended a White House holiday party but did not greet Obama .

''\nRepublicans say Obama has fixated on tax hikes for the rich at the exclusion of entitlement program reforms to curb spending , which they are seeking as part of a `` balanced '' deal .\n`` The president talks about a balanced approach , but he 's rejected spending cuts that he has supported previously and refuses to identify serious spending cuts he is willing to make today , '' Boehner said Wednesday . `` This is preventing us from reaching an agreement . ''\nObama 's roadtrip to Virginia amid the showdown was unlikely to win over any Republicans on taxes , though he used the photo op to stress the importance of doing what both sides agree : extending current , lower tax rates for 98 percent of U.S. earners .\nThe average American family of four would pay an estimated $ 2,200 more in taxes next year if the rates for middle-income earners are not extended .\n`` It 's very important we get this done now , we do n't wait , '' Obama said . `` The closer it gets to the brink , the more stressed were going to be .
