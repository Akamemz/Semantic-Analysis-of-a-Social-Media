    "content": "One hundred years ago , the U.S. government declared war on the First Amendment .\nIt all started with President Woodrow Wilson . On April 2 , 1917 , Wilson urged the nation into battle against Germany in order to `` make the world safe for democracy . '' But the president also set his sights on certain enemies located much closer to home . `` Millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy\u2026live among us , '' Wilson observed . `` If there should be disloyalty , it will be dealt with with a firm hand of repression . ''\nThat firm hand came in the form of the Espionage Act , which Congress passed in June 1917 and Wilson eagerly signed into law . Among other things , the act made it illegal to `` convey information with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the armed forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies . '' That sweeping language effectively criminalized most forms of anti-war speech . If convicted of obstructing the war effort , the guilty party faced up to $ 10,000 in fines and up to 20 years in prison .\nWith that law in place , Wilson 's threats of repression soon became reality . In August , the federal government arrested and imprisoned Charles Schenck , the general secretary of the Socialist Party . His crime ? Printing and distributing thousands of anti-war leaflets . Schenck maintained that the First Amendment clearly protected his right to speak out in that manner against U.S. militarism , but his arguments fell on deaf ears .\nOn March 3 , 1919 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld his conviction . `` When a nation is at war , '' declared Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in Schenck v. United States , `` many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight . '' He waved away the First Amendment consideration . `` The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic , '' he wrote . Censors have been quoting that sentence ever since .\nOne week later , Holmes dismissed the First Amendment yet again , this time upholding an Espionage Act conviction of the union leader and perennial Socialist Party presidential candidate Eugene Debs , who had been arrested in 1917 after giving a mildly anti-war speech at an afternoon picnic . `` This man is the palpitating pulse of the sedition crusade , '' federal prosecutor F.B .
