    "content": "CORAL GABLES , Fla. \u2014 A new Donald Trump took the stage Thursday at the Republican presidential debate , delving into policy , avoiding personal insults and refusing to take the bait when prodded by his rivals .\nThe billionaire businessman and front-runner for the nomination made good on a pledge to adopt a softer tone , cognizant that his rebellious persona threatened to become a liability and he needed to act presidential .\n\u201c So far , I can not believe how civil it has been up here , \u201d Mr. Trump said at the University of Miami in a debate sponsored by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , CNN and Salem Media Group .\nHe adopted the new debate style at an opportune moment . The debate , just days before big primaries in Florida and Ohio , marked a crucial juncture in the race when either Mr. Trump will solidify his lead or opposing forces will come together to block him .\nThe winner-take-all contests Tuesday also promise to narrow the field if Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Gov . John Kasich can \u2019 t win their home states . That would put Mr. Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in a mano-a-mano fight for the Republican nomination .\nIt was a dramatic change from the rowdy tenor and personal barbs traded at the debate last week in Michigan , where Mr. Trump alluded to the large size of his penis and branded Mr. Rubio as \u201c Little Marco . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Donald Trump says he doesn \u2019 t condone violence at rallies\nThis time , the candidates sparred over trade , immigration , Social Security and who has the wherewithal to stand up to the Washington establishment .\nMr. Trump moved quickly to preempt attacks on his business using immigration laws to bring highly skilled foreign workers into the United States , often at the expense of American workers .\n\u201c It \u2019 s something that I frankly use and I shouldn \u2019 t be allowed to use it , \u201d he said . \u201c We shouldn \u2019 t have it . Very , very bad for workers . And , second of all , I think it \u2019 s very important to say , well , I \u2019 m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do . \u201d\nHe called for a one- or two-year halt on the visa program for highly skilled workers , known as H-1B .\nEarly in the debate , Mr. Trump made a plea for the Republican Party establishment , which has skewed the tycoon , to embrace the movement he spurred and brought millions of new voters into the process to support him .\n\u201c They \u2019 re voting out of enthusiasm . They \u2019 re voting out of love , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c We \u2019 re taking people from the Democrat Party . We \u2019 re taking people as independents , and they \u2019 re all coming out and the whole world is talking about it . It \u2019 s very exciting . I think , frankly , the Republican establishment , or whatever you want to call it , should embrace what \u2019 s happening . \u201d\nHe said that his army of new voters would beat Hillary Clinton \u201c or whoever it may be . And we \u2019 re going to beat them soundly . \u201d\nMr. Rubio challenged Mr. Trump \u2019 s plan to leave Social Security intact and shore up the retirement program by cutting fraud and making foreign governments pay for U.S. military protection .\n\u201c It \u2019 s my absolute intention to leave Social Security as is , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nMr. Rubio , who wants to gradually raise the retirement age and reduce benefits , said the savings identified by Mr. Trump were a mere fraction of the deficit that will bankrupt Social Security in 20 years .\n\u201c You still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficits you have to make up , \u201d he said .\nMr. Trump responded that he can save money throughout the government by making good deals that are not manipulated by lobbyists .\n\u201c I \u2019 m self-funding my campaign . I don \u2019 t take anybody \u2019 s money , \u201d said Mr. Trump .\nMr. Cruz was the one to launch the sharpest attacks on Mr. Trump , including a challenge of the businessman \u2019 s willingness to stand up to lobbyists , the Washington establishment and Democrats , whom Mr. Trump funded in the past .\n\u201c If you are fed up with Washington , you should ask who is willing to take on Washington , \u201d he said . \u201c If you are funding the Democrats and funding Washington establishment , it \u2019 s hard to imagine how this person will stand up to Washington . \u201d\n\u201c I will say this : We are all in this together we are going to come up with solutions , we are going to find the answers to things , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nAt one point , Mr. Rubio schooled Mr. Trump on a foreign policy question . Asked whether the U.S. should open relations with Cuba , Mr. Trump remained vague , saying he would make \u201c a strong , solid , good deal. \u201d He added that he would close the embassy in Cuba until such a deal was met , as to avoid reparations and litigation .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know that Cuba is going to sue us , but if they sue in a court in Miami , they are going to lose , \u201d Mr. Rubio said to thunderous applause and laughs from the audience .\n\u201c Nothing will change for the Cuban people , \u201d said Mr. Rubio , the son of Cuban immigrants . \u201c Things are worse than they were before this opening . We \u2019 re getting nothing in return . \u201d\nMr. Cruz , whose father is Cuban , joined in against Mr. Trump , saying the businessman simply doesn \u2019 t understand the issues . \u201c His answer to everything is that everything would be better if only someone smarter were in government , \u201d he said .\nBut in another exchange , Mr. Trump doubled down on his claim that Islam \u201c hates \u201d America . Asked whether he meant that all 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide hate the United States , Mr. Trump replied , \u201c I mean a lot of them . I mean a lot of them . There \u2019 s tremendous hatred , and I will stick with exactly what I said . \u201d\nMr. Rubio criticized Mr. Trump , saying his comment has \u201c a real impact \u201d with Muslims worldwide and pointing out that Muslims serve in the U.S. military . \u201c They love America , \u201d Mr. Rubio said . \u201c As far as I know , no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military . \u201d\nMr. Cruz challenged Mr. Trump on his trade policy , noting that his proposed 45 percent tax on imports would hurt American consumers .\n\u201c If you can \u2019 t pay the bills , how does it help you to have a president to then come and say , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to jack up , I \u2019 m going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers , on automobiles when you buy automobiles , on clothing when you buy clothing , \u201d Mr. Cruz asked .\nMr. Trump hit back , saying his trade policy would actually have the opposite effect , but on the curious grounds that it \u2019 s only a threat . \u201c The 45 percent tax isn \u2019 t a tax , it \u2019 s a threat . It will be a tax if they don \u2019 t change . \u201d\nMr. Cruz , a tea party champion who nevertheless emerged as the establishment \u2019 s best bet to derail the runaway Trump train , has increasingly called for the party to unite behind him and possibly deliver him the nomination at a brokered convention in July in Cleveland .\nMr. Cruz has been the only contender to keep up with Mr. Trump in the delegate race .
