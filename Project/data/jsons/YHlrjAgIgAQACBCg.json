The Trump attorney had already emailed Emin Agalarov on 30 June asking Agalarov to contact him . \u201c Can you please give me a call at your convenience regarding certain matters , \u201d Futerfas said .\nText messages in Russian released by the committee showed Kaveladze and Veselnitskaya , the Kremlin-connected lawyer , sought another meeting with Trump \u2019 s team after the 2016 election but found doors closed to them .\nThe pair also discussed the public reaction in the US to the Trump-Russia saga . Of a dossier alleging that Trump took part in an orgy in a Moscow hotel , Kaveladze wrote : \u201c It \u2019 s nonsense . I can myself say as witness that nothing like that happened during the Miss Universe contest in Moscow . \u201d\nThe records show that Goldstone also offered to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin less than six weeks into Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign .\nThe publicist suggested in a July 2015 email to Rhona Graff , Trump \u2019 s executive assistant , that Trump may \u201c welcome a meeting with President Putin , which Emin would set up \u201d .

Show Hide Accusations Natalia Veselnitskaya is the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr , Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort at Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 . Trump Jr has published emails showing Veselnitskaya was introduced to him as a \u201c Russian government attorney \u201d who had damaging information about Hillary Clinton . Background Veselnitskaya is a defence lawyer based just outside Moscow , whose main client in recent years has been Denis Katsyv , a businessman accused of profiting from a major tax fraud uncovered by lawyer Sergei Magnitsky . She fought his case in US courts and mounted a PR campaign to try to clear Katsyv \u2019 s name and overturn the \u201c Magnitsky Act \u201d sanctions against Russian officials that followed . The big question Veselnitskaya is not a government official and portrays herself as a lawyer with a private client . The question , then , is how she was able to secure the meeting at Trump Tower during a presidential campaign and why she was introduced to Trump Jr as representing the Russian government .\nReports have said the president took a direct role in the preparation of the statement . Mueller is understood to want to ask Trump about his involvement .\nAsked in the interview if his father was involved in drafting the statement , Trump said : \u201c I don \u2019 t know . I never spoke to my father about it . \u201d\nAccording to the transcripts , Trump Jr also said he didn \u2019 t think there was anything wrong with attending the Trump Tower meeting in which he was promised dirt on Hillary Clinton .\nOn Wednesday Trump Jr said in a statement that he was \u201c candid and forthright \u201d in his interview with the committee .\nGoldstone told the committee he thought the meeting was a \u201c bad idea \u201d .\nHe said he reported back to Emin Agalarov that \u201c this was the most embarrassing thing you \u2019 ve ever asked me to do .
