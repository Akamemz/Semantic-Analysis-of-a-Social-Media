In addition , Europe will assign monitors to ensure that Greece will also have to give up control of the proceeds from government sales , with the bulk being earmarked for debt payments .\nGreece had been pushing for some of its massive debt load to be canceled . Europe rejected that , but said it would consider easing the terms with longer grace periods .\nStill , the deal is just a proposal , and it does not mark an immediate end to the crisis .
