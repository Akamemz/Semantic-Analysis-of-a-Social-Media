    "content": "Iran \u2019 s long record of hiding its nuclear and military programs from outside inspectors is coming under fresh scrutiny as the U.S. and other world powers race to meet a June 30 deadline for a final deal to curb Tehran \u2019 s program and open its nuclear sites to closer international inspection .\nWhile advocates say the deal represents the best chance to date for Western powers and Iran to overcome more than a decade of heated tension around program , critics argue that Tehran \u2019 s long record of cheating , evading and concealing its activities from U.N. inspectors renders any agreement worthless .\nThe question at the center of eleventh-hour negotiations opening in Geneva on Wednesday is whether Iran and the West can truly see eye to eye on a specific set of rules by which the main U.N. nuclear watchdog \u2014 the International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 will be allowed to access nuclear and other sites inside Iran after a deal is signed . The question of access to inspectors is just one of series about the Iran nuclear deal that The \u2588\u2588\u2588 will explore in the coming days .\nTehran is expected to play hardball down to the wire , as evidenced by the Iranian parliament \u2019 s passage in recent days of legislation calling for IAEA inspectors to be banned from any non-nuclear sites , such as sensitive military installations , under the terms of any final deal .\nMany see the move as a direct challenge to the nuclear talks because it butts up against more than a decade of Western suspicion that Iran is bent on the clandestine pursuit of a bomb .\nThe idea that IAEA officials won \u2019 t be allowed to visit military sites prompted a wave of uneasy remarks Monday from European diplomats in the so-called P5+1 \u2014 the negotiating group comprising the U.S. , China , Russia , Britain , France and Germany .\nSEE ALSO : Iran could enjoy sanctions relief before year \u2019 s end : report\nThe Obama administration has appeared undeterred . Administration officials have downplayed the Iranian parliament \u2019 s move and stuck to a rhetorical line laid down last week by Secretary of State John F. Kerry that Washington is looking ahead , not at the past .\nAlthough Iran may have spent years hiding its efforts from the IAEA , Mr. Kerry told reporters , the Obama administration is prepared to look beyond such history . \u201c We \u2019 re not fixated on Iran specifically accounting for what they did at one point in time or another , \u201d he said . \u201c We know what they did . We have no doubt . We have absolute knowledge with respect to the certain military activities they were engaged in . \u201d\nThe comments triggered outrage among some analysts , including Mark Dubowitz , executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , who once advised the administration on Iran policy .\n\u201c If you look forward without looking back , then you miss decades of Iranian nuclear mendacity and a well-established record of Iranian cheating and challenging the IAEA , \u201d Mr. Dubowitz said in an interview . \u201c I think Secretary Kerry should be more cautious in assuming that the U.S. intelligence community has \u2018 absolute knowledge \u2019 of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\n\u201c The Iranians stonewalled the IAEA for years . They \u2019 ve been denying inspectors access , and they \u2019 ve been building illicit nuclear facilities that we \u2019 ve been unable to detect , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 ve gone through six separate U.N. Security Council resolutions since 2006 , and time and time again , in every report , the IAEA has said it was unable to certify that Iran \u2019 s nuclear program is peaceful \u2014 that there are no undeclared sites or activities and there is no illicit diversion of nuclear material . \u201d\nIndeed , a timeline on the official website of the IAEA outlines a history of back-and-forth between the U.N. nuclear inspectors and Iranian authorities dating back to 2002 .\nAlthough there is sporadic evidence of cooperation from Tehran over the years , the period was highlighted by repeated incidents of frustration by IAEA inspectors , who felt they were either outright blocked or intentionally misled during investigative visits to Iran .\nSuch frustration reached a critical moment in 2006 , when the U.N. Security Council responding by passing a resolution demanding that \u201c Iran suspend uranium enrichment by 31 August or face possible economic [ and ] diplomatic sanctions . \u201d\nThe Security Council flatly asserted that , despite years of attempts by IAEA inspectors to gain access to sites inside Iran , the agency was \u201c still unable to provide assurances about Iran \u2019 s undeclared nuclear material and activities . \u201d\nEven with the resolution in place , Tehran continued to defy the agency , prompting the Security Council to level its first slate of sanctions banning foreign companies from selling nuclear-related materials and technology to Iran and freezing the assets of several officials tied to the nuclear program .\nIranian stonewalling of IAEA inspectors continued into 2007 , prompting an expansion of the sanctions and the establishment of a U.N. arms embargo against the Islamic republic .\nBy 2012 , the sanctions had been renewed and widened several more times and the Obama administration was pushing for a worldwide embargo on Iranian crude oil .\nThe goal , administration officials would say , was to pressure Iran to the negotiating table in hopes that Tehran \u2019 s tumultuous relationship with the IAEA might be reset along more positive lines .\nThe effort generated the momentum behind the nuclear talks that have played out over the past 18 months . Supporters of a prospective deal say the window is now open like never before to chart a new narrative between Tehran and the West .\n\u201c The question is , do you want to resolve this issue or not ? \u201d said Trita Parsi , who heads the National Iranian American Council and whose 2012 book , \u201c A Single Roll of the Dice , \u201d delved deeply into the Obama administration \u2019 s Iran policy .\n\u201c If the premise is that because of the history we can never trust anything , well then , OK , let \u2019 s prepare for war because that \u2019 s the logical line of thinking , \u201d Mr. Parsi said in an interview . \u201c The fact that there have been problems in the past is the very reason as to why we have to resolve those problems . \u201d\nThe difference today is that there is a real chance of achievement , Mr. Parsi said . He asserted that on two occasions over the past 12 years \u2014 in 2003 and in 2010 \u2014 authorities in Tehran made clear attempts to reach out to the West with overtures to resolve the nuclear crisis but were spurned both times by Washington .\n\u201c The bottom line is this : Neither side has had completely clean hands when it comes to this enmity that exists between the Iran and the U.S. , \u201d Mr. Parsi said .\nRegardless of the developments in Iran \u2019 s parliament , he said , Tehran will have no choice but to cooperate with the IAEA under terms of the deal in consideration .\n\u201c The process that has been put into place , \u201d he said , \u201c does not require trust in Iran . It requires that the mechanism for verification of what the Iranians have committed themselves to doing is done and that if the Iranians cheat , they will be caught . \u201d\nSkepticism still looms large , especially in light of evidence that Iranian authorities have continued to clash with the IAEA even as the past year and a half of negotiations have progressed .\nOne example was a confidential IAEA report in February that accused Iranian officials of failing to address accusations that they carried out explosives tests and other activities that could have been aimed at developing a nuclear bomb .
