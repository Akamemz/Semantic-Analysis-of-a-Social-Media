Hawkey , like a lot of his former colleagues , recalls the camaraderie of the place , the practical jokes that would break up a shift , how all the families would get together outside work for birthdays and barbecues .\nAnother thing the former steelworkers all remember : how good the health coverage was .\n\u201c When I was at Bethlehem Steel , we \u2019 d get billed zero , \u201d Hawkey said . \u201c And that was probably one of the biggest cultural shocks in the world , when we lost our healthcare . When they went bankrupt , we lost our insurance . \u201d\nThe steelworkers truly needed health insurance . The most common injuries in the plant were from collisions with moving objects , as iron ore and additives were smelted and shaped into super-hot beams that rolled through the mill , except when they jumped the track . Between 1965 and the mill \u2019 s closure , 45 people were killed at the plant , according to Frank Behum , a former steelworker and oral historian .\n\u201c This was the most dangerous steel mill in the United States , and the local people never knew it , \u201d Behum said . \u201c Osha [ the occupational safety and health administration ] didn \u2019 t come in until 1974 , and it actually wasn \u2019 t fully implemented until 1980 . And that made a big difference . \u201d\nThe steel era is gone , taking with it thousands of \u201c womb to tomb \u201d jobs that came with comprehensive health benefits . In Northampton County , fewer people are getting injured on the job , but residents now contend with new health challenges : obesity , heart disease , cancer , drug addiction .\nThe need for care is still there , but affordable coverage might not be . Judging by dozens of interviews in recent months , frustration about healthcare was a significant factor at the ballot box when , last November , Northampton County voted for Donald Trump for president , after having voted for Barack Obama twice .\n\u201c My healthcare payments just kept going up , every month , every year , \u201d recalled a lifelong Northampton resident named Rachelle , 36 , who did not want to give her last name because she works in education and wanted to keep politics out of it .\nRachelle was a Democrat who voted twice for Obama , before switching her party registration in March to vote for Trump during the Republican primary season , as many other Democrats in Northampton County did . \u201c I think I finally woke up , \u201d she said . \u201c I finally realized that Donald Trump \u2013 he spoke to the common folk . \u201d\nHours before Rachelle spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the Congressional Budget Office had released a report on the Trump-endorsed Republican plan to replace Obama \u2019 s healthcare law . It said that 14 million people would be ejected from insurance rolls by next year , healthcare costs for low-income patients would increase , while tax breaks would be delivered to top earners .\nRachelle said she did not believe the media reports . She trusted Trump to get healthcare right .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s still too early to determine , and I \u2019 d like to wait and see how this will roll out , \u201d she said . \u201c I trust whatever \u2019 s he \u2019 s going to do . I am sure they are going to make it work . \u201d\nFrank Hawkey , the steelman , did not vote for Trump , in part because he viewed the candidate \u2019 s promises to bring back American manufacturing as patently false . \u201c Trump says he \u2019 s going to restart the steel industry \u2013 well , I \u2019 ve got news for him , and it \u2019 s all bad , \u201d Hawkey said . \u201c The older guys , they don \u2019 t believe it . They \u2019 re realists . The steel mill \u2019 s not coming back . No two ways about it . \u201d\nStill , Hawkey said , some Democrats who lived through the heyday of steel bought into Trump \u2019 s promise . If you can say , \u201c I never knew a time when I didn \u2019 t have the best insurance in the world , \u201d the slogan Make America Great Again might resonate .\nThe realization that the Republican healthcare plan could be devastating for people who depend on healthcare subsidies has been attended by wrenching stories from across the country of low-income Trump supporters with major health problems who are alarmed at the idea that they could now lose care as a result of Trump \u2019 s win .\nThat \u2019 s not the main story in Northampton . Enrollment here in Medicaid , the subsidies program for low-income patients , is slightly below the national average . The top two employers in the county are healthcare networks , both of which have drawn on federal funds for their continued expansions , in exchange for which they are required to provide a significant amount of free or reduced-rate care . People say access to care and the care itself are generally good .\nWhat is unusual about Northampton County \u2013 and one reason healthcare was such an influential issue here in the 2016 election \u2013 is how immediate the pressures of the global marketplace can seem to the average voter . Many people here still remember how the dumping of foreign steel on the American market , beginning in the 1970s , hastened the decline of the local industry .\n\u201c One of the big things everybody voted for was healthcare , \u201d said Ken Kraft , a locally based business agent for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades . \u201c We \u2019 re competing in everything against companies that don \u2019 t pay for healthcare . Here we have to pay a certain percentage . That \u2019 s paying for the competition to compete against us . So that \u2019 s a strong reason to vote against the status quo . \u201d\nWhile a scathing Trump critic himself , Kraft said more than half the members of his union had voted for Trump , many because they bought Trump \u2019 s promise to make US businesses more competitive by controlling healthcare costs .\nWith its confluence of freeways , railroads and rivers , and its proximity to the ports of the eastern seaboard , Northampton has an unusually high number of homegrown firms that compete in global markets , including Victaulic ( industrial piping ) , Follett ( refrigeration ) , Crayola ( art supplies ) , and Martin Guitars ( great tunes ) .\nRichard Master is CEO and founder of MCS Industries , Inc , the leading US supplier of picture frames and decorative mirrors , with $ 170m in sales , 160 US employees and factories in Mexico and China . He started the business in Easton , in east Northampton County , on the remnants of a box company his father had founded in 1948 .\n\u201c Our healthcare bill for those 160 workers is $ 2m , and the average cost per hour is $ 8 to $ 10 an hour , \u201d Master said . \u201c Particularly for family plans , it is a huge , huge expense , a huge part of the overall compensation package for workers .\n\u201c We need to be competitive with the world , and that \u2019 s why healthcare , which is so expensive in the United States , is a major concern if we \u2019 re going to reindustrialize consumer products here in the US . \u201d\nMaster , a former Bernie Sanders supporter who produced a documentary film called Fix It : Health Care at the Tipping Point , believes that the announcement by the Pennsylvania health department last October that insurers had requested increases in premiums of 25 % or more had given a boost to Trump in the election .\n\u201c This information came out in the weeks preceding the election , \u201d Master said . \u201c Policies were being canceled . Old policies were being canceled . There were new policies that were proposed with high double-digit increases . And I think this had a very significant impact on this election . Nationally and certainly locally . There were front-page articles in the local newspapers about this . And it was alarming . \u201d\nAfter the steel plant closed , Frank Hawkey was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma . His insurer summarily dropped him , citing what it viewed as a pre-existing condition , he said . He went a couple of years without coverage before regaining insurance through his wife \u2019 s food distribution business . Now he \u2019 s on Medicare .\nBethlehem , Pennsylvania : the town that built America \u2013 in pictures Read more\nHawkey said protections in the Obama law for people with pre-existing conditions were reassuring to him . \u201c To this day , pre-existing conditions mean a lot to me , because \u2013 I don \u2019 t know if they could kick you off Medicare , but I \u2019 m sure they could stop treating you . \u201d\nComplaints about Obama \u2019 s healthcare law in Northampton County are easily come by . When the current executive , John Brown , took office in 2014 , the county faced a penalty under the so-called \u201c Cadillac tax \u201d provision of the law , which was designed to combat distorted tax incentives that led some employers to take out excessively costly healthcare plans .\nFor the coverage it offered its 1,850 full-time employees , Northampton County faced a penalty of $ 9.4m , to kick in from 2018 , a penalty that would have grown in future years , Brown said . \u201c It seemed to be an overly punitive part of the law for taking very good care of your employees , \u201d he said .\nTo avoid the penalty , he came up with a complex solution using multiple insurance policies to keep up the quality of care for his workers \u2013 but he was left feeling that a a system intended to put the care of ordinary workers first had failed by over-regulating a considerate employer .\nBut for all the complaints about Obama \u2019 s healthcare act , one doesn \u2019 t have to go far in Northampton County to find someone who loves the law , and views the current Republican effort with trepidation , or worse . Few of the stories are as dramatic as that of Jennifer Newland , who lives in Roseto , in the northern part of the county .\n\u201c Two years ago , I was diagnosed with stage 4 liver , colon and lymph node cancer , \u201d said Newland , who now works for a Democratic state representative . \u201c I had no symptoms at all . \u201d\nShortly before her diagnosis , Newland had left a job and had been offered coverage through Cobra for $ 354 a month , with a $ 2,500 deductible .\n\u201c I was like , \u2018 Oh my gosh , how is this going to work ? \u2019 \u201d Newland said . \u201c So I looked at the ACA [ Affordable Care Act ] . And I ended paying $ 149 for a $ 300 deductible plan . \u201d\nThen came the cancer diagnosis . Newland sought treatment in the Lehigh Valley hospital network .\n\u201c There were no hurdles . It was so smooth , \u201d she said . \u201c They would have a nurse call me . They would have a caseworker call me . They would check in all the time to make sure \u2013 Did I have any questions ? Did I need any more help ?\n\u201c At one point I said to them , could I have physical therapy , because I \u2019 m just not feeling strong ? And they were like , \u2018 absolutely \u2019 . It was kind of like , no questions asked . If this is the care that you feel you need to get back to 100 % , we \u2019 ll provide it for you . \u2019 \u201d\nNewland \u2019 s cancer is in remission . \u201c The ACA literally saved my life , and I couldn \u2019 t be prouder to stand up for it , \u201d she said .\n\u201c This whole repeal effort really has me worried for the people out there that continue to have it . That \u2019 s really a huge issue for me . I \u2019 m sad for the people who might lose their insurance .\n\u201c Even with Trump , I hope that he sees the light . I hope that he gets to hear stories of people that the ACA has touched . \u201d",
