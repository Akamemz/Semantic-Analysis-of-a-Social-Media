A new report out last week has triggered more debate about the haves and the have-nots.\n\nThe study, led by Raj Chetty of Harvard University, says it's not any harder to achieve economically in the U.S. today than it was 20 years ago. That flies in the face of growing criticism that the income gap is putting some opportunities beyond the reach of average Americans.\n\nA National Challenge\n\nPresident Obama last month called income inequality and economic mobility \"the defining challenge of our time.\" The president, who is set to deliver his State of the Union message on Tuesday, also promised to keep those issues front and center for the remainder of his presidency.\n\n\"While we don't promise equal outcomes, we've strived to provide equal opportunity,\" he said.\n\nHistorically, however, the country's policies have sought to address both. President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty created early childhood education programs and investments in poorer schools.

He says the rich get richer from investments in the financial markets, and secure better educations for their children.\n\nMinimum-wage and middle-income earners, meanwhile, cannot keep pace, making it less likely their children will have the opportunities to move up.\n\n\"The American dream is less robust than the Canadian dream,\" he says.\n\nChildren born in Canada and some European countries do, in fact, have a better shot at working their way out of poverty than American kids. But an academic study published last week found that, contrary to popular perception, it has not gotten harder to climb the income ladder in the U.S. in the past two decades.\n\nOr A Problem Of Perception?\n\nScott Winship, a fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, says that study debunks some commonly held misconceptions. Just because a handful of people at the top are making much more money than the rest of the workforce, he says, does not mean there are greater barriers to climbing the economic rungs.\n\n\"There's an intuition among a lot of people that inequality has these problematic effects, but when you really get down to the research that's been done, it's hard to find a reason to worry,\" Winship says.\n\nWinship says policy should aim to increase access to opportunities to those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.

And the discrepancy, while staggering, benefits a relative handful of those outliers.
