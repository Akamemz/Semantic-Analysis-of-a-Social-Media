    "content": "WEST PALM BEACH , Fla. \u2014 The 2016 Democratic primary effectively ended Tuesday night , with Hillary Clinton as the all-but-certain winner but Bernie Sanders barely acknowledging it .\nFor Clinton , a narrow win in Illinois and double-digit victories across the battleground states of Florida , North Carolina and Ohio provided deliverance from a humbling loss in Michigan a week earlier and finally gave her the space to begin her pivot to Donald Trump and the general election . That left the Vermont senator to deliver his standard 60-minute stemwinder in Phoenix without mentioning a single defeat .\nAfter noting that she now has a 300-delegate lead \u2013 which will make it essentially impossible for Sanders to catch up given the rules of the Democratic process -- Clinton turned her attention to the front-runner for the Republican nomination .\n\u201c Our commander-in-chief has to be able to defend our country , not embarrass it , \u201d she told her energetic supporters .\n\u201c When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants , banning all Muslims from entering the United States , \u201d Clinton said , discussing Trump \u2019 s most outrageous policies , \u201c when he embraces torture , that doesn \u2019 t make him strong , it makes him wrong . \u201d\nWith Trump sweeping Florida and knocking Marco Rubio out of the race , Clinton also highlighted the heightened stakes for Democrats , noting that \u201c tonight , it \u2019 s clearer than ever that this may be one of the most consequential campaigns of our lifetimes . \u201d\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean Sanders -- fueled by a money machine that never stalls -- will fade into the ether any time soon . The calendar now turns to a string of overwhelmingly white , caucus states like Idaho , Utah , Washington , and Alaska , where he is favored to collect the small piles of delegates available -- 244 delegates in total , counting Hawaii on March 26 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s amazing , he \u2019 s a cash machine , \u201d marveled a Clinton insider . \u201c If he loses , he says , \u2018 big bad Hillary is winning. \u2019 Boom , $ 5 million . If he wins , it \u2019 s like , \u2018 keep the revolution going ! \u2019 Boom , $ 5 million . We got 1.5 million more votes . But either way , he gets $ 5 million . \u201d\nClinton on Tuesday night crushed Sanders in Florida -- where there are more eligible voters in South Florida than in all four early nominating states combined -- with a 31-point victory . And she won North Carolina by a hefty 16-point margin , despite a $ 1 million Sanders ad blitz over the past week that tripled her spending there .\n`` Hillary Clinton 's wins tonight effectively ended the Democratic nomination for president , \u201d said Brad Woodhouse , the president of Correct the Record . \u201c It is all but mathematically impossible for Bernie Sanders to overtake her lead . Her message is resonating and hers is the real revolution -- a revolution that will break down barriers and that will get things done for the American people . ''\nBut if Florida was a bonanza that widened the delegate gap between them , Ohio was the wild card win that allowed Clinton to shift her gaze forward -- her 13-point victory represented a staggering blow to Sanders , who was not able to translate his economic message and opposition to foreign trade deals into success in Ohio and Illinois . In the other industrial Midwestern states to vote Tuesday , Clinton held a slight lead in Missouri with 99 percent of the vote in .\nDelegates Remaining : 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination\nThe Clintons had deeper roots in Ohio , which the Democratic frontrunner won eight years ago , and had more union backing there than she did in Michigan . That contributed to big wins across the state -- she won early voters by over 40 points in Cleveland ; by almost 30 in Columbus ; by almost 40 in Cincinnati ; and by over 40 in Dayton , a Clinton campaign aide said , crediting campaign manager Robby Mook \u2019 s game plan for the resounding win .\nEven as Clinton all-but-announced the next phase of her campaign Tuesday night , campaign operatives said they would continue to fight hard in the Arizona primary March 22 , in order to break up Sanders \u2019 expected string of caucus state wins that could follow .\nWhile Sanders booked $ 1.7 million in ads the week before the Arizona primary , Clinton \u2019 s campaign Tuesday night released its first Spanish-language ad , which draws a direct contrast with Trump . Arizona is where the campaign expects to begin ramping up and spending money beginning Wednesday .\nIf there 's one deficit left for the campaign to address , it 's cash . Clinton acknowledged as much Tuesday night , imploring her supporters to \u201c join the 950,000 supporters who already have contributed , most less than $ 100 \u201d and guiding them to her website to donate . The campaign followed up with a text signed `` H '' from Hillary , telling supporters : \u201c If you knocked on doors , talked to friends , pitched in , or voted -- tonight is your victory .
