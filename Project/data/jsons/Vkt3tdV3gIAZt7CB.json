A White House official tells The Brody File that on Monday they \u2019 ll announce a policy called , \u201c Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance , \u201d in which $ 8.8 billion will be appropriated through various federal agencies and departments . In essence , President Trump is taking the pro-life policy to a whole different level . This is much more extensive than when President George W. Bush reinstated it back in 2001 . Yet another evangelical victory under this administration . On a myriad of issues , Donald Trump has n't disappointed evangelicals since he 's taken office .\nLet \u2019 s explain .
