    "content": "Tuesday \u2019 s primaries featured the crucial state of Pennsylvania plus a smattering of contests in the not-so-crucial states of Nebraska , Idaho , and Oregon .\nThe realities of a complex array of races with their own local dynamics defy the construction of pat narratives . Left-wing Democrats won some races and lost others , while in other cases , former insurgents have not been entirely embraced ( or co-opted ) by the establishment .\nBut it \u2019 s clear the party is moving in a leftward direction , with even the most mainstream new Democratic candidates on the scene embracing views that would have been extremely daring five or 10 years ago . They are also simply riding positive momentum from the national political environment and \u2014 in the specific state of Pennsylvania , though not nationally \u2014 from some newly favorable district boundaries .\nA real sign of the shifting winds of American politics came from the victory of a pair of first-time candidates backed by the Democratic Socialists of America who knocked off two incumbent state legislators from a well-established Pittsburgh political family .\nBoth Dom and Paul Costa , the incumbent losers , were on the conservative side of modern Democratic Party politics but also seemingly well-entrenched .\nInstead , they lost \u2014 to Sara Innamorato , a 32-year-old nonprofit manager and former Apple retail store worker , and Summer Lee , a 2015 graduate of the Howard University School of Law . Their wins are ideological victories for the left but also reflect basic demographic dynamics . Women , and especially younger women and women with college degrees , are the core of the anti-Trump political mobilization , and candidates who can mirror and channel that specific demographic are well-positioned to win Democratic primaries this cycle .\nBy contrast to the Innamorato and Lee wins , Bernie Sanders endorsed Rich Lazer in the PA-5 primary , and Sanders and his Our Revolution organization invested heavily in Gregory Edwards \u2019 s campaign in PA-7 .\nEdwards ended up losing to a former Allentown solicitor named Susan Wild who ran with the support of Emily \u2019 s List , which works to get pro\u2013abortion rights Democratic women elected to office . ( The third candidate , longtime Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli \u2014 an anti-abortion , anti-immigrant Trump supporter \u2014 would have been a very awkward fit for the House Democratic caucus . ) And Lazer came up short against Mary Gay Scanlon .\nThe two winning women are plenty progressive , describing health care as a right and opposing Social Security cuts , especially by the standards of pre-2016 Democrats . But neither was a favorite of the organized left .\nJess King , another Our Revolution Democrat , won the nomination for a long-shot run in the heavily Republican PA-11 , while Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) favorite Chrissy Houlahan got the nod for what should be a very easy pickup in PA-6 . In addition , Bibiana Boerio is getting the nod for Democrats in what should be an extraordinarily difficult PA-14 race .\nThe bottom line is that while the current Pennsylvania House delegation contains no women , next year \u2019 s should feature at least three and quite possibly more .\nRemember Conor Lamb \u2019 s shocking win in the PA-18 special election a little while back ?\nWell , that district doesn \u2019 t exist anymore under Pennsylvania \u2019 s new election map . A chunk of it is slotted into what \u2019 s now PA-17 , a district that \u2019 s way bluer ( though still slightly red ) than the old PA-20 , and into which Lamb has slid over as an incumbent . The rest was folded into the new PA-14 , which is even redder than old PA-20 .\nThat was supposed to give the poor sap Lamb beat , Rick Saccone , a chance at vindication , since his organization and name recognition were supposed to make him the frontrunner for the GOP nomination there . Except instead , he lost to state Sen . Guy Reschenthaler because evidently Rick Saccone is not good at winning elections .\nAs the only Democratic governor of a state Trump carried up for reelection in 2018 , Pennsylvania \u2019 s Tom Wolf ought , on paper at least , to be somewhat at risk . He is , instead , the beneficiary of both a favorable national political environment for Democrats and also of the self-fulfilling prophecies that a favorable environment can create .\nYou can see that in the primary battle that played out in the GOP side where Scott Wagner , a two-term state senator from the suburbs of Harrisburg , won the nomination against two opponents who \u2019 ve never held elective office .\nWagner \u2019 s not a joke candidate by any means , but he \u2019 s a relatively weak recruit for a Pennsylvania GOP that boasts 11 members of the US House of Representatives , several of whom are retiring at relatively young ages . Wolf would likely have been favored against any possible GOP contender , but the very fact that he was favored scared off more formidable possible opponents , which in turn leaves him even more favored .\nIt \u2019 s rare to see an incumbent lieutenant governor attract vigorous primary challenges , but Mike Stack managed to land himself in an unusual sweet spot . Scandals related to his spending and treatment of state employees weren \u2019 t bad enough to drive him from office in disgrace but did cost him the confidence of the state party ( Gov . Wolf hasn \u2019 t endorsed him for reelection ) and drew a number of challengers into the race .\nThe winner is John Fetterman , the heavily tattooed mayor of the small town of Braddock outside Pittsburgh . He was also challenged by Nina Ahmad , a physician and former deputy mayor of Philadelphia . The two challengers were both avatars of competing visions of the future of the Democratic Party , with Fetterman emblematic of a back-to-the-future drive to connect with the white working class and Ahmad representing a vision of a diverse party firmly grounded in the classes of professionals and social service providers .\nFetterman ran for Senate in 2016 as a kind of Berniecrat ( though without really garnering support from Sanders himself ) and surprised observers by pulling 20 percent of the vote against two much better-known opponents . This won himself a reputation as a charismatic figure and potential rising star .\nThe office itself is not particularly powerful or significant , but it does provide a statewide platform from which to run for higher office , either governor or senator . Consequently , we are going to end up hearing more about John Fetterman in years to come .\nLook , Oregon is a nice state , and I had a really good time when I visited there a few years ago . Nice people , great food , and these days , the economy has basically recovered from a more-brutal-than-average dose of the Great Recession .\nBut Oregon \u2019 s 2018 primary is basically a huge dud . It \u2019 s way out there in Pacific time , with generous voting hours , so initial results don \u2019 t even begin to come in until 11 pm Eastern time . But it \u2019 s also a vote-by-mail state , and while making it easy and convenient for people to vote is great , it further delays the vote counting in many cases . In this particular case , though , nobody really cares .\nThe only race political observers were watching was a Republican primary for the gubernatorial nomination , and though it turned weirdly vicious \u2014 with retired Navy Capt . Greg Wooldridge and entrepreneur Sam Carpenter slamming the frontrunner , state Rep. Knute Buehler , as too moderate \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t really matter because incumbent Kate Brown is probably going to be reelected .\nThe last time a Republican won a governor \u2019 s race in Oregon was in 1982 ( really ) . While that streak will undoubtedly be broken someday , it \u2019 s going to require either a scandal-plagued Democratic nominee or a very different national political climate than the one that \u2019 s prevailing this year .\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee does not endorse primary candidates , per se , but it does maintain a roster of Red to Blue program members who are considered the party \u2019 s best prospects for flipping seats . It sometimes adds people to Red to Blue before nominations have been settled .\nOne such Red to Blue recruit , entrepreneur and former Air Force officer Chrissy Houlahan , is on a glide path to Congress with an uncontested primary and the chance to run in an open seat in a district Hillary Clinton carried , thanks to the redrawn map and the retirement of incumbent Republican Rep. Ryan Costello .\nBut Brad Ashford , who served one term in the US House of Representatives from the Omaha-based second district , has not had it so lucky . Ashford , a moderate who used to be a Republican state legislator and who ran for Omaha mayor as a nonpartisan independent , fits the DCCC recruiting model perfectly .\nLocal progressives rallied instead behind Kara Eastman , a more conventional liberal who runs a nonprofit called the Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance . In national politics , she secured support from Justice Democrats and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee .\nDespite running a platform of single-payer health care and a $ 15-per-hour minimum wage , Eastman didn \u2019 t snag an Our Revolution endorsement ( likely because she backed Clinton in 2016 ) but also didn \u2019 t secure support from Emily \u2019 s List or NARAL . They overlooked Ashford \u2019 s past as an anti-abortion state legislator in favor of his solidly pro-abortion rights record during his two years in the House .\nThe race was incredibly close ( and hadn \u2019 t yet been called at press time ) , a fact that doesn \u2019 t bode well for the DCCC \u2019 s top choices .",
