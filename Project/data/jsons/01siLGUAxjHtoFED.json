    "content": "The Weekly Standard shut down on Friday after 23 years of publication . In an unceremonious execution , MediaDC , the magazine \u2019 s owner , instructed staff to clear out their desks by the end of the day . According to co-founder John Podhoretz , MediaDC chose to kill the outlet so it could strip-mine its assets and subscriber list . The shuttering of the flagship conservative publication is a deeply unfortunate development in an era when right-leaning media is increasingly obsequious toward Donald Trump and hesitant to criticize his abuses of power . No critic of the president should cheer the Weekly Standard \u2019 s demise .\nTo many progressives , Friday \u2019 s news may seem to be just desserts for a magazine that has long espoused what the left views as noxious policy proposals . And there is no doubt that the Weekly Standard has published more than its share of dubious , specious , and offensive articles . The magazine was closely aligned with the George W. Bush administration and , notoriously , vigorously promoted the catastrophic war in Iraq . Its LGBTQ coverage is reliably atrocious\u2014recall this 2009 classic titled \u201c The Worst Thing About Gay Marriage , \u201d which claims without evidence that the \u201c most profound aspect of marriage \u201d is \u201c protecting and controlling the sexuality of the child-bearing sex . \u201d\nI could go on . The magazine is vehemently anti-abortion and anti-trans , pushing offensive falsehoods to mock and degrade transgender people . It has asserted that gay people , like me , who sought the right to marry will demand polyamory next . Writers routinely peddle climate change skepticism and denialism . These articles are dangerous and irresponsible .\nThere is obviously much to criticize here , and I do not expect liberals to praise a magazine that has derided their beliefs for more than two decades . But there is still nothing to celebrate about its untimely death . Over the last few years , the Weekly Standard has emerged as one of the very few conservative outlets to resist Trumpism , to defend a vision of conservatism that rejects Trump \u2019 s lawlessness , his authoritarian impulses , and his grotesque embrace of white nationalism . Even if the Never Trump movement represents a small segment of the Republican Party , it remains an important counter to the broader opportunistic conservative embrace of the president . And the Weekly Standard \u2019 s dissolution will only encourage other right-wing outlets to publish more irresponsible pro-Trump garbage .\nThat is not to say that every other conservative publication has entirely jettisoned its principles to defend Trump . If you \u2019 re interested in a reasonable take on , say , the Robert Mueller investigation or Trump \u2019 s trade wars , you can read David French in National Review or Gabriel Malor in the Federalist . But these voices are ever rarer and lonelier . As I write , the top story on National Review is an absurd defense of Michael Cohen \u2019 s crimes , which argues that prosecutors are \u201c twisting campaign-finance law \u201d to secure his conviction . Its purpose is not to defend Cohen himself , but the criminal acts to which he has confessed and in which he has implicated Trump . The Federalist has posted a similar article , as well as a dark warning that the FBI is \u201c hiding the truth \u201d about Michael Flynn , replete with a baseless intimation that Mueller \u2019 s team might be destroying documents that could exonerate Flynn .\nThe Federalist appears to be the new model for conservative media , a truly depressing development given its almost unrelenting dishonesty . In May , the Week \u2019 s Damon Linker wrote a devastating critique of the magazine \u2019 s many lies about the FBI . The Federalist , Linker wrote , \u201c is a leading disseminator of pro-Trump conspiracies and up-is-down , funhouse-mirror distortions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into Russian election meddling and potential Trump involvement. \u201d If anything , that \u2019 s an understatement . The Federalist led the push to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who long oversaw the probe . It has claimed , over and over again , that Mueller is leading a partisan \u201c witch hunt. \u201d Its authors have decried his \u201c obsessive pursuit \u201d of the president and condemned Mueller as \u201c the clown prince of federal law enforcement. \u201d At every turn , the Federalist seeks to reinforce Trump \u2019 s claim that the Mueller probe is illegitimate , if not illegal .\nThe Weekly Standard , by contrast , has remained profoundly skeptical toward Trump .\nClick over to National Review and you \u2019 ll find a more mixed bag ; French , for instance , writes eloquently and accurately about the investigation and its achievements . But his work is countered by Andrew McCarthy , a fantasist who describes Rosenstein as a \u201c weasel , \u201d declared that Mueller \u201c stacked his staff with partisans , \u201d wrote that Paul Manafort \u2019 s conviction was \u201c good news for President Trump , \u201d claimed Mueller set up Trump for a \u201c perjury trap , \u201d and indicated that the FBI is corrupt . McCarthy also champions the narrative that the Steele dossier \u201c was the driving force behind the Trump\u2013Russia investigation , \u201d which is false .\nThere are plenty more examples . Byron York at the Washington Examiner humiliates himself by lying to help Trump and spreading conspiracy theories about the FBI .
