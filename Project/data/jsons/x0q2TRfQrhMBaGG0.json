    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Brett Kavanaugh launched a bold effort to save his nomination to the US Supreme Court on Monday , lashing out at `` smears '' and a `` grotesque and obvious character assassination '' following the emergence of a new allegation of inappropriate sexual behavior .\nKavanaugh made clear that he was having no thoughts of folding his nomination , despite allegations dating to the 1980s , and warned that if his candidacy failed , it would deter people of all political persuasions from entering public service .\n`` There is now a frenzy to come up with something -- anything -- that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring , '' Kavanaugh wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee leaders , and made clear he intends to defend himself at a hearing Thursday that will also feature testimony from his original accuser , Christine Blasey Ford .\n`` The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out . The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out . The last-minute character assassination will not succeed , '' he wrote .\nKavanaugh 's firm personal defense came as President Donald Trump and other top Republicans made a show of rallying round his nomination , sending a signal that the fresh allegations would not , for now , derail his hopes of serving on the court .\n`` ( F ) or people to come out of the woodwork from 36 years ago and 30 years ago and never mentioned it and all of a sudden it happens , in my opinion it 's totally political , '' Trump said in New York . `` It 's totally political . ''\nThe President called his nominee `` a fine man with an unblemished past . ''\nHe said later on Monday that it would be `` sad '' if Kavanaugh 's nomination was upended by the allegations .\n`` His family has suffered , '' Trump said . `` His family has suffered . What 's going on is not something that should happen . Brett Kavanaugh is an absolute , outstanding person . Hopefully he will be confirmed quickly . ''\nKavanaugh was scheduled to appear with his wife for a sit down interview on Fox News Monday evening . In a clip aired before the full interview , Kavanaugh said he would not let the allegations kill his nominations .\n`` I 'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process , '' Kavanaugh told Fox News . `` We 're looking for a fair process where I can be heard defending my integrity , my life-long record ... of promoting dignity and equality for women , starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old . I 'm not going anywhere . ''\nKavanaugh quickly denied the new accusation by a female former fellow student about an alleged incident when he was at Yale University in the early 1980s . Ford had previously alleged that he sexually assaulted her at a house party in the Washington , DC , suburbs when they were teenagers in high school -- an accusation the judge strongly denies .\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Dianne Feinstein , responded to the new allegation on Sunday night by calling on the Republican committee chairman , Sen. Chuck Grassley , to order an `` immediate postponement '' of any further action on Kavanaugh 's nomination .\nHer intervention is likely to focus extra scrutiny on the accusation reported by The New Yorker and to raise the stakes even further for Thursday 's hearing at which Kavanaugh is expected to present a vehement defense , which now looms as crucial for his confirmation hopes .\n`` I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation , and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims , '' Feinstein wrote .\nGrassley 's office issued a statement accusing Democrats of again actively withholding information from the rest of the committee only to drop it at `` politically opportune moments . ''\n`` It increasingly appears that they are more interested in a political takedown than pursuing allegations through a bipartisan and professional investigative process , '' Grassley 's spokesman Taylor Foy said , while pledging to evaluate the new allegations .\nIn a sign that the GOP is not willing to cut Kavanaugh lose , at least yet , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , who sits on the Judiciary Committee , accused Democrats of causing the `` total collapse of the traditional confirmation process for a Supreme Court nominee . ''\n`` It is being replaced by a game of delay , deception , and wholesale character assassination , '' Graham said in a statement .\nKavanaugh was nominated by Trump to be the man who would enshrine a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a generation .\nBut the allegations against him have emerged as a severe complication for Republicans , who are under intense pressure from their grass roots to swiftly confirm him while they seek to mitigate further damage with women voters who strongly favor Democrats in November 's midterm elections .\nIf Kavanaugh is eventually confirmed , it will be by the tightest of margins because Republicans can only lose one vote in the Senate if all the Democrats stick together .\nSo Sunday 's developments and Thursday 's hearing will intensify pressure on two of the Republicans seen as the most likely to flip , Maine 's Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski . Outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake , who sits on the Judiciary Committee , is also a potential worry for the White House .\nThere was no immediate reaction to Sunday 's new allegation from any of that trio .\nThe New Yorker story focuses on an allegation made by Deborah Ramirez , 53 , who was at Yale with Kavanaugh and said she remembers him exposing himself to her at a dormitory party .\n`` This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen , '' he said in a statement . `` The people who knew me then know that this did not happen , and have said so . This is a smear , plain and simple . I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth , and defending my good name -- and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building -- against these last-minute allegations .
