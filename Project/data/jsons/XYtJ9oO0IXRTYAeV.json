    "content": "But before Jane Castor could speak , she was greeted by an organizer brandishing a bullhorn .\n`` Go home , Jane ! '' yelled Bernice Lauredan , 28 , an activist with Tampa Dream Defenders . `` You are not welcome here . ''\nMore than a thousand miles away , Dennis Maurice Dumpson has been helping to organize strategy sessions with activists in Philadelphia , a city where Democrats hope protests will ignite massive voter turnout and propel presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden to victory in battleground Pennsylvania . But Dumpson , 36 , has no intention of mobilizing his growing list of followers to help Biden or any other politician . The most he intends to do for the Democrats , if anything , is cast a reluctant vote .\n`` We 've seen enough to know how this goes and how this plays out , '' Dumpson said . `` I 'm tired of going into the same old room with the same old council member and the same state representative who have the same old mind-set . It 's why we keep getting the same old stuff . ''\nFloyd \u2019 s killing in Minneapolis last month ignited protests in more than 750 U.S. cities , an avalanche of outrage that echoes the moral overtones of the 1960s civil rights movement , with the added power of drawing support from participants of all races in every corner of the country .\nThe uprising is also a potential boon for Democrats , inspiring thousands of new grass-roots organizers , many in their 20s and 30s and new to activism , just as the party seeks to mobilize young voters and other core liberals to defeat President Trump and retake the Senate . Many of the country \u2019 s top Democrats , including former president Barack Obama , have exhorted the activists to channel their energy toward the election .\nBut the Democrats have so far failed to tap into the newly emerging protest movement , even turning off some activists who see early outreach efforts as hollow gestures , according to interviews with more than a dozen organizers who have been leading protests across the country in recent weeks . Many said they remain deeply skeptical of the traditional political system and the Democratic Party , which they said has a history of promising change and falling short .\nAlthough the activists agreed that Trump is a racist who should be defeated , many said they think neither party is equipped to address the roots of the fury in America \u2019 s streets . That , they said , would require a willingness to embrace changes that have historically been deemed too radical by many mainstream politicians , such as defunding police forces that routinely target black communities and rolling back drug laws that lead to mass incarceration . Biden and Democratic lawmakers have said they don \u2019 t support defunding police , though they have backed redirecting funding for public safety programs .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t believe just having a \u2018 D \u2019 by your name immediately makes you the savior , \u201d said Lauredan , the organizer who shouted down the Tampa mayor . \u201c And I would say that for every Democrat I know , we have to look at solutions that are really going to invest in our communities . . . . We need to change not just the surface-level issues . \u201d\nOrganizers noted that while some Democrats have made their presence known at various protests , activists are wary of political leaders who seek to capitalize on the outrage without giving a full hearing to their message .\n\u201c [ Politicians are ] kneeling but not meeting with the organizations that are responsible for moving voters on the ground , \u201d said Alicia Garza , principal for Black Futures Lab and co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement . \u201c When October comes along , they \u2019 re going to say can we have you on our [ Instagram ] live ? Can we have you come to this fundraiser ? And October is too late to start courting people . October is the time to begin capitalizing on the relationships you \u2019 ve made \u2014 not to start building them . \u201d\nObama took note of the emerging tension between activists and Democratic political leaders earlier this month , when he urged protesters to get involved in politics .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been hearing a little bit of chatter in the Internet about voting versus protest , politics and participation versus civil disobedience and direct action , \u201d Obama said . \u201c This is not an either-or \u2014 this is a both-and . To bring about real change , we both have to highlight a problem and make people in power uncomfortable . \u201d\nBut so far , efforts by some leading Democrats have done little to bring the movement into the political fold .\nSome activists , for instance , were turned off by the rollout last week of the Justice in Policing Act . Co-sponsored by more than 200 Democrats in both houses of Congress , the bill would ban neck restraints like the one that killed Floyd and no-knock warrants like the one that led to the death of Breonna Taylor . It also would make it easier to hold officers accountable for misconduct in civil and criminal courts .\nBut Abdul-Aliy Muhammad , a Philadelphia-based activist , had trouble seeing past the kente cloth . The Democratic leadership walked out in stoles made of the brightly colored fabric of Ghanaian origin . They also knelt for 8 minutes , 46 seconds \u2014 the amount of time Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin spent with his knee on Floyd \u2019 s neck .\nMuhammad saw it as a performative photo op , specifically because leaders intimated it may take months \u2014 and a new president as well as a Senate majority \u2014 for the bill to be passed .\n\u201c It was uber-pandering . It was like super-pander , or pandering on steroids , \u201d Muhammad said . \u201c You \u2019 re doing it to show some faux solidarity with black people and you failed miserably . \u201d\nHouse Majority Whip James E. Clyburn ( D-S.C. ) , the highest-ranking African American in House leadership , said he was irked by the criticism of the moment . He said he also worries that demonstrators energized by Floyd \u2019 s death are too quick to criticize people who seek to enact social change in a different way \u2014 or at a different pace .\n\u201c We all have a role to play , \u201d he said . \u201c My role is to pass legislation and count votes . You can \u2019 t reject my role because it doesn \u2019 t go as fast as you want it . \u201d\n\u201c What does it get us for anybody to be insulting to Nancy Pelosi , \u201d Clyburn added later , referring to the House speaker who , along with other lawmakers , appeared in kente cloth . \u201c We asked Nancy Pelosi to identify with us , to carry water for us . She made a gesture that identifies with us and we insult her . \u201d\nSen. Kamala D. Harris of California , who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination and is under consideration to be Biden \u2019 s running mate , said she shares the activists \u2019 concerns that change will come too slowly .\n\u201c But my optimism overrides that fear , because we are seeing people take to the streets who seemingly have nothing in common , but have this issue in common , and are unifying and coalition-building around this issue , \u201d she said .\nOther top Democrats have looked for ways to tap into the movement .\nBiden has expressed solidarity with the protesters \u2014 vowing to combat systemic discrimination , meeting with the Floyd family and saying in a video message to his funeral that America must \u201c turn away from racism that stings at our very soul . \u201d\nA Biden spokesman , Jamal Brown , said the former vice president is sympathetic with the frustration of activists as they combat racism in policing , housing , education and other aspects of society . \u201c He understands these problems won \u2019 t change overnight , but [ it \u2019 s ] not worth giving up the fight , \u201d Brown said , adding that Biden has worked for civil rights causes over the course of his career .\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , whose bid to take the majority in his chamber relies on mobilizing voters in a handful of races targeting vulnerable Republican members , said he has been in touch with some grass-roots organizations . He said many activists know that change requires their engagement in the country \u2019 s political debates .\n\u201c They understand you have to accept the idea that you have to push Washington around , \u201d Schumer said .\nSchumer added that he has sought advice from Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , whose two unsuccessful presidential campaigns were able to excite a movement of young activists .\n\u201c What are the things that we can get to motivate people ? \u201d Schumer said he asked Sanders , though he would not detail more of their conversation .\nNina Turner , a chief surrogate for Sanders \u2019 s presidential campaign , said those conversations seem redundant . The senator \u2019 s bid for the presidency identified many of the policies activists are asking lawmakers to enact .\n\u201c There are already a list of things . There \u2019 s no need to study , no need to have a task force ; the ideas are already out there , \u201d she said . \u201c You \u2019 re either going to do universal health care or you \u2019 re not . You \u2019 re going to legalize marijuana , take it off of Schedule I , or you \u2019 re not . You \u2019 re either going to have a $ 15 minimum wage or you \u2019 re not . \u201d\nTension around the pace of progress and disappointment in establishment politicians was also a hallmark of the civil rights protests of the past , said Matthew F. Delmont , a Dartmouth College professor who focuses on African American history . Malcolm X warned people that neither Democrats nor Republicans had adequate plans to help black Americans in his \u201c Ballot or the Bullet \u201d speech . And Martin Luther King Jr. called on his followers to not accept political stalling .\n\u201c It \u2019 s always come down to the question of time , \u201d Delmont said . \u201c Dr . King had so many great sermons or speeches about time and how that group of activists just could not wait . People feel the same way today . You can \u2019 t wait for Biden to get elected . You can \u2019 t wait four years . We can \u2019 t wait on politicians if we want to see these things change . \u201d\nBut while civil rights protesters of the 1960s were able to direct pressure on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to win landmark legislation rolling back state-sponsored discrimination , today \u2019 s protesters face the challenge of seeking changes that extend beyond the political realm \u2014 rooting out racism baked in at all levels of society over the course of centuries , or what Delmont called the \u201c unresolved policy issues from the 1960s movement . \u201d\nSome activists mobilized by Floyd \u2019 s death say they would have a hard time overcoming long-standing disappointment with Democrats .\nMarjaan Sirdar , a Minneapolis activist who lives a few blocks from where Floyd was killed , noted that his city has seen years of Democratic leadership that promoted initiatives to advance racial equality . At the same time , Sirdar said , the city was not working hard enough to root out racism in its police department .\n\u201c The Democrats created this problem , \u201d Sirdar said . \u201c Anybody can pay for a $ 200 , $ 300 training and learn how to sound anti-racist . They learn the language of anti-racism and they just become better gatekeepers of white supremacy . \u201d\nMichele Rayner-Goolsby , a lawyer who has advised activists and is now running for a Florida state House seat , said she understands demonstrators \u2019 distrust of many politicians but thinks a Biden election would be a step forward , particularly if he selects a black woman to be vice president .\n\u201c I hear the concerns of folks , and I don \u2019 t want to discount those concerns , but I also think we can \u2019 t get lost or caught up in the minutiae of he doesn \u2019 t do this or he doesn \u2019 t do that . We literally have an anti-black president in office right now . \u201d\nStephanie Keene , a Philadelphia organizer who wants to abolish the police and prison system , said many who are inspired to protest this year see politicians as part of the problem .\n\u201c Some people are like I \u2019 m . . . done accepting what the Democratic Party has offered us . It \u2019 s not getting better , \u201d said Keene , 37 . \u201c This current moment is a reflection of the United States \u2019 inability to meet any of the demands black people have put forward . I wish they would stop holding black people responsible for the failures of the Democratic Party . Why aren \u2019 t y \u2019 all responsible for not giving us a candidate worth voting for ? \u201d\nDumpson , the author and activist from Philadelphia , said he , too , is wary of politicians \u201c not really wanting to really sit down with us \u201d but is not yet ready to check out of the political system entirely . That is why , he said , Biden will have his vote but not his enthusiasm .",
