    "content": "The \u201c Resist \u201d movement spawned a shooting rampage Wednesday morning that targeted Republican lawmakers \u2014 an attack by a self-declared anti-Trump crusader that underscored the poisonous tenor of modern American politics .\nWhile police were silent about a motive , the Republicans who came under fire as they practiced for a charity baseball game said they were certain they were targets because of their political party . And the gunman \u2019 s biography backs them .\nThe shooter opened fire at a baseball field in Alexandria where the Republican team had been practicing for weeks , seriously wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise , a congressional staffer , a lobbyist and two U.S. Capitol Police officers from Mr. Scalise \u2019 s security detail .\nThe officers returned fire and killed the gunman , identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville , Illinois .\nHis brother said Hodgkinson was upset about the election of President Trump and traveled to the Washington area weeks ago to protest .\nAs leaders in both parties appealed for national unity and political civility , some supporters of Mr. Trump said the shooting by a supporter of Sen. Bernard Sanders \u2019 White House bid was a likely consequence of an increasingly hostile \u201c Resistance \u201d crusade against the president .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve had an increasing intensity of hostility on the left , \u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , an ally of Mr. Trump . \u201c You \u2019 ve had a series of things which send signals that tell people that it \u2019 s OK to hate . \u201d\nA day after falling just shy of winning his party \u2019 s gubernatorial nomination in Virginia , Corey Stewart was even blunter , accusing Democrats and liberal activists for encouraging supporters to take \u201c the fight to the streets . \u201d\n\u201c This is the fault of the left , \u201d Mr. Stewart , chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c They have blood on their hands . \u201d\nThe demonizing of Mr. Trump has become a contest of one-upmanship , which in just the past weeks involved comedian Kathy Griffin displaying a likeness of the president \u2019 s bloody severed head and the staging of a play in New York City that depicts the assassination of Mr. Trump .\nThe vitriol directed at Mr. Trump has extended to his Republican allies in Congress , whose support for the president \u2019 s agenda has sparked such a heated outcry that some lawmakers have debated the need for more security at town hall meetings in their districts .\nIt was in that increasingly polarized political culture that Hodgkinson opened fire with an assault rifle at Republican lawmakers and staffers at the baseball field at 7:09 a.m. Wednesday , after inquiring whether the players were Republicans or Democrats .\nMr. Scalise of Louisiana , the third-ranking House Republican , was wounded in the hip as he stood near second base . He dragged himself into the outfield grass , leaving a bloody trail in the dirt as the gunman methodically took aim at other players .\nMr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited Mr. Scalise at MedStar Washington Hospital on Wednesday night . Mrs. Trump brought flowers to the recovering lawmaker .\nThe hospital said in a tweet Wednesday afternoon that Mr. Scalise \u201c was critically injured and remains in critical condition . \u201d\nIn the evening , Mr. Scalise \u2019 s office said a single rifle shot traveled through his left hip , fracturing bones , damaging organs and causing severe bleeding . He received multiple blood transfusions , and his critical condition will require additional operations .\nAfter the visit , Mr. Trump took to Twitter to say that Mr. Scalise \u201c is in very tough shape . \u201d\n\u201c But he is a real fighter . Pray for Steve ! \u201d Mr. Trump wrote .\nLawmakers and other witnesses described the agonizing minutes they spent seeking cover at the athletic complex until Capitol Police officers were able to return fire .\nIn all , dozens of shots were fired , shattering car windows and whizzing over the heads of terrified residents who had brought their pets to a nearby dog park or visited a YMCA adjacent to the ballfield .\nRep. Mo Brooks , Alabama Republican , dove with other lawmakers into the first-base dugout .\n\u201c A couple of the people in the dugout had cellphones telling people we were under attack , and they \u2019 re screaming for reinforcements , \u201d Mr. Brooks said . \u201c We \u2019 re helpless . We \u2019 ve got bats versus a rifle \u2014 not good odds . So very intense moments . I don \u2019 t know how many dozens of shots , 50 to 100 , but there \u2019 s a lot of it . \u201d\nKatie Filous of Alexandria told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she was walking dogs to the dog park when she heard loud popping sounds and saw \u201c little puffs of dirt on the baseball field . \u201d\n\u201c People were screaming , \u2018 He has a rifle , he has a rifle , \u2019 \u201d she said . \u201c The gun was really , really loud . Everybody was screaming , \u2018 Lay flat. \u2019 It was terrifying . \u201d\nShe witnessed the shooting of one of the uniformed Capitol Police officers , who was returning fire against the gunman .\n\u201c I saw a person get out of a black Suburban . He or she had a handgun , saying , \u2018 Drop your weapon ! \u2019 \u201d Ms. Filous said . \u201c I saw the gunman shooting the agent . \u201d\nThough investigators wouldn \u2019 t say they had established a motive for the shootings , Hodgkinson , in addition to a record of run-ins with the law , had a history of lashing out at Republicans and belonged to a Facebook group called Terminate the Republican Party .\nHe had volunteered for Mr. Sanders \u2019 presidential campaign . A post on a Facebook page believed to be Hodgkinson \u2019 s stated : \u201c Trump is a Traitor . Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy . It \u2019 s Time to Destroy Trump & Co . \u201d\nFormer Navy SEAL and Trump supporter Carl Higbie of Connecticut placed the blame on Democratic leaders for fanning the flames of the \u201c Resist \u201d movement .\n\u201c We must examine why it has happened , \u201d Mr. Higbie said . \u201c It \u2019 s because the Democratic Party , led by Maxine Waters , Nancy Pelosi , my home-state U.S. senator Chris Murphy and the like have encourage [ d ] this childish , anarchist # Resist movement to the point where people are acting violently on behalf of it . \u201d\nHe said Democrats must \u201c stop this vitriolic # Resist narrative and start acting like adults because your words have consequences . \u201d\nOthers said it was premature to lay blame . Rep. Peter T. King , New York Republican , said there are unbalanced individuals on both ends of the political spectrum .\nMr. Sanders took to the Senate floor to condemn the attack . He said he was horrified to learn that the suspect had been a volunteer for his presidential campaign last year .\n\u201c I am sickened by this despicable act , \u201d Mr. Sanders said . \u201c Let me be as clear as I can be . Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society , and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms . \u201d\nHours after the attack , Rep. Claudia Tenney , New York Republican , said she contacted Capitol Police about a threatening email she received .\n\u201c One down , 216 to go , \u201d a Boonville , New York , resident wrote in the email , published by Politico .\n\u201c Did you NOT expect this ? \u201d the person wrote . \u201c When you take away ordinary peoples very lives in order to pay off the wealthiest among us , your own lives are forfeit . Certainly , your souls and morality were lost long before . Good riddance . \u201d\nMs. Tenney , a freshman lawmaker , told Syracuse.com that the nation should be having a robust debate about policy issues , but \u201d this is beyond another realm . \u201d\nRep. Rodney Davis , an Illinois Republican who was at the ballfield , pleaded for more political unity in the aftermath of the shooting .\n\u201c It \u2019 s my breaking point of civility in politics when you go to baseball practice for a game for charity and you have to dodge bullets and you watch your colleagues lay in [ the ] field , \u201d Mr. Davis said . \u201c Hate has to stop . We can disagree on policies as Republicans and Democrats , as Americans , but that \u2019 s what makes this country great . It \u2019 s a sad testament of what I now consider political rhetorical terrorism . \u201d\nBut Mr. Stewart wasn \u2019 t in a forgiving mood , saying Democrats have condoned violence against conservatives in the past , so he doesn \u2019 t buy their calls for unity now . He highlighted Miss Griffin \u2019 s \u201c Trump beheading \u201d publicity , which resulted in CNN breaking ties with the comedian .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t see conservatives attacking liberals or Democrats . It is always the vile , disgusting , animals that are attacking Republicans , \u201d Mr. Stewart said .\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , told a packed House chamber later that \u201c an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us . \u201d\nIn the most obvious display of unity , lawmakers in both parties said the annual charity baseball game will take place as scheduled at 7:05 p.m. Thursday .\nBut on a broader level , Mr. Gingrich and others said , the hostile political rhetoric is spinning out of control .\n\u201c I talk to college students regularly who say to me if they are openly for Trump , they get threatened , \u201d Mr. Gingrich said on Fox News . \u201c Some of them get death threats . The intensity on the left is very real , whether it is a so-called comedian holding up the president \u2019 s head in blood or it \u2019 s right here in New York City , a play that shows the president being assassinated . \u2026 This intensity has been building , I think , since election night . \u201d\nAfter the shooting , Donald Trump Jr. retweeted with approval a post from conservative political commentator Harlan Z. Hill : \u201c Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President . \u201d\nSince Mr. Trump \u2019 s election , many front lawns in the heavily Democratic neighborhood where the shooting took place have displayed signs proclaiming a generic message of \u201c Kindness. \u201d Sprinkled among them are some \u201c Resist \u201d signs , along with a few holdouts still defiantly sporting \u201c Clinton/Kaine \u201d signs .\nA Virginia poll watcher in Alexandria said she believed the shooting was a carryover of the anger displayed by the Resist movement during Tuesday \u2019 s primary elections in Virginia .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not as if I certainly expected this to happen or whatever , imagined or predicted this to happen , but in retrospect , yesterday I visited four or five precincts right around the immediate area where the shooting occurred , and the vitriol and the anger was palpable , \u201d Mari Estull said in a phone interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nMs. Estull , 51 , said she was spit upon and cursed at by the Resist protesters .\n\u201c Virginia was out in force yesterday voting , so it was kind of unusual because I got to see the actual voters . \u2026 I got to sort of have a glimpse of the tenor of the feeling in politics here and it just so happens the very next day this happens and I \u2019 m in shock . In retrospect , it \u2019 s almost like \u2018 aha , \u2019 \u201d said Ms. Estull , a mother of two . \u201c I certainly can \u2019 t say I saw this coming , but I sensed this seething anger yesterday , just 24 hours ago . \u201d\nLt. Gov . Ralph Northam won the Democratic gubernatorial primary , aided by a TV campaign ad in which he called Mr. Trump a \u201c narcissistic maniac \u201d and saying \u201c we \u2019 re not letting him bring his hate into Virginia . \u201d\nPartisan vitriol was still evident on social media hours after the shooting .\nSome people lashed out at David Axelrod , who served as an adviser to then-President Barack Obama , when he said on Twitter that he was \u201c saddened to read political responses among expressions of thoughts and prayers . Can we please hit pause on that for now ? \u201d\nOn the Facebook page called the Trump Resistance Movement , many people ridiculed Mr. Axelrod \u2019 s plea for unity .\n\u201c Turn about is fair play , \u201d wrote Steve Lubbs of Longmont , Colorado . \u201c The president [ Mr. Trump ] has shown us the way . \u201d",
