The revenue raised would be used to reduce deficits and to pay for the cost of lowering tax rates and simplifying the tax code . The new framework calls for tax reform to raise about one-quarter of the $ 2.4 trillion -- or $ 600 billion .\nMedicare : Reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending by cutting payments to health care providers , changing incentives for providers and beneficiaries , and increasing premiums for high earners , among other changes . Bowles and Simpson say Medicare changes should account for another $ 600 billion .\nInflation-adjusted payments : Adopting a less generous and some say more accurate inflation formula , known as `` chained CPI , '' for any federal payments that are adjusted for cost of living , such as Social Security benefits . Chained CPI would also apply to inflation adjustments for income tax brackets .\nOther measures : Curb farm subsidies and increase how much civilian and military personnel contribute to their health and retirement plans .\nThe framework calls for half of the $ 2.4 trillion to be raised through these savings , combined with stricter limits on discretionary spending , along with chained CPI and interest savings .\nIn addition , the new Bowles-Simpson framework calls for lawmakers to go beyond that $ 2.4 trillion for the long-term . Among other things , they recommend Congress agree to Social Security reforms this year and earmark future savings for the program .\nMany Democrats oppose changes to entitlement programs unless they only affect the wealthy .
