''\nThe prime minister 's spokesman has reiterated the government 's opposition to a customs union and another referendum , saying : `` Both of those have been voted on on a number of occasions in the House of Commons and neither have been successful . ''\nThe prime minister 's deal ditches the backstop - the controversial `` insurance policy '' designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border .\nInstead it will , in effect , draw a new customs border in the Irish Sea , because goods which could then travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax .\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay told a Lords committee Northern Irish businesses would also have to complete export declarations to send any goods to the UK mainland .\nThe EU is now considering how to respond to the UK 's request for a delay , but BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said it was `` virtually impossible '' for MEPs to approve the deal at the European Parliament session this week as they would not sign it off until all necessary steps had been taken in the UK Parliament .\nHe said the Strasbourg parliament could hold a special session next week to approve the deal , but it was more likely they would do it at the next planned session on 13 November - meaning an extension would be needed .\nOn Saturday , instead of answering the question , `` Do you support the deal or not ? '' MPs effectively chose to change the question , backing the so-called Letwin amendment instead , which delays approval for the deal until the WAB is passed .\nChief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said he `` very much hoped '' the Speaker would allow the government a second chance to get MPs to give a straightforward `` yes '' or `` no '' .\n`` What the Oliver Letwin amendment did is mean that Parliament has n't given its explicit positive support for the deal , '' Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .\n`` It was an observation on the deal happening and I think what people need is a substantive vote . ''\nFormer Conservative minister , now independent MP , Justine Greening said the proper process through Parliament had to be followed in order for the WAB - a `` huge bill '' - to be given sufficient scrutiny .\n`` We all know that rushed law is bad law , this is the political rewiring of our country and it has to be done properly , '' she told the BBC .\nBut Mr Sunak said : `` The substance of the withdrawal agreement has been public for a very long time , the bits that have changed - the backstop and the political declaration - were published last week .\n`` Parliament has shown time and time again ... an ability to move very quickly when it wants to . We can sit late sit , at weekends . And that 's of course what we should do . ''\nA straight vote on the deal today seems unlikely because the government did n't pull the vote on Saturday - they walked away from it . So , theoretically , the Commons did give a view on the issue , and it ca n't be asked to give a different one today - let 's see .\nThe government is desperate to have a vote on the whole shebang as soon as possible to show momentum , before getting into days of scrutiny where MPs will try to make changes to the deal .\nThat 's not just because they are worried about losing more votes - this government has barely won any - but because if MPs make any major changes to the legislation , then it might mean PM has to go back to EU and ask for a different deal - you can imagine how much No 10 wants that .\nIt also , of course , eats up time , making it harder and harder as the hours tick by for the government to be able to stick to the 31 October deadline - still not impossible , but looking increasingly unlikely .\nIf the WAB ends up not getting through or being changed , there is very little chance the government will be able to avoid a delay , so the smart bet is that No 10 will just go back to pushing very hard for an election .\nOnce a delay is agreed , it will be hard for opposition parties to block one - lots of individual MPs do n't want it , but the government is prepared to hold a vote of no confidence in itself , or go for a simple majority vote if they ca n't get it through under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 's two-thirds bar .\nThe UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM 's Brexit deal that will take the country out of the EU - in UK law .\nIt has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs - and then of peers in the House of Lords . And a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it .\nThe bill gives legal effect to the withdrawal deal , as well as any agreed transition period , and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit .
