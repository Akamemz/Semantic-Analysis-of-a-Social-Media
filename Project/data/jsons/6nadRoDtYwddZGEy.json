Bernstein 's article is meant to explain why it looks like Democrats do n't have a bench even though they do , and Salam 's article is meant to show who 's sitting on it .\nBernstein 's argument is related to the `` invisible primary '' theory of presidential elections . Hillary Clinton , he says , `` has earned the support of the bulk of Democratic party actors , and gained the acquiescence of other Democrats who aren \u2019 t as enthusiastic about her . '' The result is that the Democratic Party 's `` perfectly viable other candidates either dropped out or never seriously considered the race . ''\nPerhaps a slightly clearer way to put it is this : in the invisible primary , when the contest is as much a draft as it is a campaign , Clinton is `` opposed '' by essentially every Democrat fit for the presidency . If the party 's powerbrokers did n't want to support Clinton and instead really wanted Sen. Michael Bennet to run , or Gov . Andrew Cuomo to lead the field , they would be working toward that outcome . Instead , they 're lining up behind Clinton . In this telling , Clinton is n't winning by default . She 's winning by winning . The absence of competition is the product of Clinton 's strong , successful campaign to win over Democratic Party elites .\nHillary 's strength is evident in public polling , too . Gallup has a useful favorability-familiarity index , the upshot of which is that Clinton is both better known than anyone else in the race and viewed more favorably than almost anyone else in the race ( Ben Carson is viewed very favorably too , but as he becomes better known among Democrats , my guess is that his negatives will rise quickly ) :\nThis is the context for Hillary 's dominance on the Democratic side : she 's in a much stronger position not just than any Democrat going into 2016 , but also than any Republican . These are early polls and the numbers can and will change , but look where Clinton is compared to Jeb Bush or Scott Walker . That 's a big deal to Democrats , and a big reason they 're supporting her rather than looking for an alternative .\nSalam offers a `` wish list of Democratic presidential contenders . '' His list excludes possible candidates like ex-Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley or ex-Virginia Senator Jim Webb . Rather , it includes plausible candidates who seem to have no interest in becoming actual candidates .\n`` Any contest for the Democratic presidential nomination needs an earnest , nerdy liberal technocrat who appeals to the intelligentsia , '' writes Salam , and he nominates Sen. Ron Wyden , a favorite of wonks ( and civil libertarians ) everywhere :\nHis steadfast opposition to dragnet surveillance has won him many friends among civil libertarians , and that \u2019 s no small thing in a Democratic primary , particularly in dovish , independent-minded states like New Hampshire . A Pew survey from January found that 31 percent of Democrats hold an unfavorable view of the National Security Agency , which is not a bad little foundation for a Wyden campaign . Moreover , Wyden has proposed a universal health care plan more ambitious than Obamacare , and he \u2019 s championed the idea of allowing states like Vermont and Oregon to build their own single-payer health systems .\nSalam goes on to push Sen.
