Dawson smiled and triumphantly lifted a sign of her own .\n`` All the way ! '' Dawson shouted , shorthand for taking the pro-Sanders fight all the way to the Democratic convention .\nThe Democratic primary ended more than three weeks ago . Sanders himself , who wasn \u2019 t present at the rally , has toned down his criticism of Hillary Clinton , shifting his focus to defeating Donald Trump and admitting that his \u201c political revolution \u201d will almost certainly end without him in the White House .\nBut in California , the forever Sanders movement is still Berning full force .\n\u201c Here in California , people are very much more revved up and still revved up , \u201d said Steve Dunwoody , a Los Angeles-area Sanders volunteer who was recently elected as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention .\nActivists here point to a number of factors that are fanning the embers . There \u2019 s a general distrust of Clinton and of the system that has built up over the long primary campaign . But there are also more local grievances : anger at the slow pace of vote counting after Election Day , as well as a belief that Sanders \u2019 loss in the primary was driven in part by the media declaring Clinton the presumptive nominee the night before voters went to the polls .\nIt \u2019 s a fire that feeds itself . As elsewhere , Sanders supporters in California are a tight-knit group who stay in touch , back each other up on social media and push their revolution forward . To a person , they don \u2019 t want to let go of the feeling campaign 2016 has inspired in them .\nSome activists even insist that Sanders may yet win California , when all the votes are counted . While Clinton won California on election night , her margin has shrunk a bit , from about 12 percentage points to 8 percentage points . And , three weeks later , counting is not quite wrapped up . There were about 350,000 potential ballots still to be counted as of June 30 , according to the California secretary of state \u2019 s website . Officials have attributed the glacial pace to thousands of vote-by-mail and provisional ballots still being counted at a local level .\nThe lingering resentments don \u2019 t mean a rift in the Democratic Party will put California up for grabs in November . Democrats far outnumber Republicans here , a state so blue that its upcoming Senate race will be decided by a runoff between two Democratic candidates .\nInstead , the fear for Clinton is that the lingering far-left resentment may be shared by like-minded Sanders supporters in swing states , where she will be more dependent on party unity to defeat Trump .\nWhile Clinton and national Democrats evince confidence that Sanders supporters will eventually back her , national polling shows why the continued angst in California is problematic : A recent Bloomberg poll showed that only a bit more than half \u2014 55 percent \u2014 of Sanders supporters said they were planning to back Clinton . Some 22 percent said they would back Trump . Another recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found better support for Clinton among Sanders supporters , with 78 percent of Sanders voters backing Clinton , numbers that had improved from a previous poll .\nBut here , the pragmatic case for party unity has to compete with ubiquitous displays of pro-Sanders passion . In rallies and protests that have continued after the June 7 primary , and in social media posts and stubborn displays of bumper stickers and yard signs , the examples of continuing tension are all over the state . In cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco , murals of Sanders \u2019 image still beam down from walls .\nFor many activists , talk of surrendering the revolution to unite against a common enemy is infuriating .\nMichael Seaman , who lives in an unincorporated area outside of the state capital , Sacramento , said he still \u201c prays that Bernie ends up the nominee at the convention. \u201d He grows angry every time he gets an email from the Democratic National Committee , he says , because he views them as pestering him to give up . His wife , he says , plans to leave the Democratic Party because of what they see as an unfair process .\n\u201c I believe that both the alleged nominees are not good choices . And I 've spent my whole life voting for the lesser of two evils , and I 'm sick and tired of it , \u201d he said .\nHe would like to see the Democratic platform represent some of the progressive ideas Sanders championed . Even then , he said , he \u2019 s learned enough about Hillary Clinton that he \u2019 s fairly sure he can \u2019 t support her .\n\u201c The party is putting a lot at risk if it disrespects some of the people involved , people I have met who are previously uninvolved voters and independents , \u201d Seaman said . \u201c They could easily bring people into their tent .
