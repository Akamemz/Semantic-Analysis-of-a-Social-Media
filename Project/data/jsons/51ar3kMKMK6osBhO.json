Oh yes you are , \u201d Maddow said , also claiming that the article \u201c ends with this sort of war cry about how a country can \u2019 t work , how definitely democracy can \u2019 t work unless the country is defined by a unifying race . \u201d\nMenashi \u2019 s article does not say anything about democracy requiring that people be of the same race . What the article is about \u2013 and what Maddow does not mention \u2013 is the reconciliation of liberal democratic ideals with the concept of Israel as a Jewish state . Menashi , who is Jewish and of Iraqi descent , argues that Israel being a Jewish state is no different than other countries establishing a state for citizens of a common origin .

Maddow claimed that Menashi wrote about that story \u201c in the course of his academic career \u201d -- but lawyer Ed Whelan wrote in the National Review that not only was this taken out of context , but it was not during his academic career . Rather , Menashi discussed it in a book review prior to starting law school and after completing college , not when he was a law professor . Whelan also noted that Menashi did not endorse the methods described in the story .\n\u201c Nowhere in his book review does Menashi argue in favor of such anti-terrorism tactics , \u201d Whelan wrote . \u201c On the contrary , he faults the author whose book he is reviewing for promoting a view of American power that 'would divorce itself from a special concern for human rights ' and for amorally 'sanction [ ing ] brutal tactics for maintaining order .
