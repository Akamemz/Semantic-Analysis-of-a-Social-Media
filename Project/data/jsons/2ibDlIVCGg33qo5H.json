    "content": "Welcome to the GOP 's age of rage : Shocking new study shows how anger is fueling the Republican Party According to a new Pew Poll , Republicans do n't trust the government at all\u2014even while they control almost all of it\nAccording to the latest Pew poll , Republicans are mad as hell and they 're not going to take it anymore . They are , as usual , deeply confused about what government does and what they want it to do , but whatever it is , they 're very angry about it . Thirty-two percent of GOP voters say they are mad at the government , while only 12 percent of Democrats say the same . According to Pew , among the truly engaged ( like those , say , who go to a political rally a year before an election ) , 42 percent of Republicans are angry compared to 11 percent of Democrats .\nBoth sides say you can not trust the government , but Democrats ' views do n't change depending on who is in the White House while Republicans are far more trusting of government when one of their own is president :\nIn Barack Obama \u2019 s six years as president , 13 % of Republicans , on average , have said they can trust the government always or most of the time \u2013 the lowest level of average trust among either party during any administration dating back 40 years . During George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency , an average of 47 % of Republicans said they could trust the government . By contrast , the share of Democrats saying they can trust the government has been virtually unchanged over the two administrations ( 28 % Bush , 29 % Obama ) .\nIt does n't appear , then , that despite their constant bleating about the predations of big government , this mistrust is truly a matter of principle with Republicans . Republican voters simply believe that government is the enemy unless Republicans are in charge of every bit of it . This famous quote by Grover Norquist in the wake of the 2004 GOP victory perfectly expresses how they believe government is supposed to work :\n`` Once the [ Democratic ] minority of House and Senate are comfortable in their minority status , they will have no problem socializing with the Republicans . Any farmer will tell you that certain animals run around and are unpleasant , but when they 've been fixed , then they are happy and sedate . They are contented and cheerful . They do n't go around peeing on the furniture and such . ''\nAnd while one might think that having majorities of governors and state legislatures , running both houses of Congress and a majority on the Supreme Court would make them hate the government less , without having control of every branch , they are convinced that they are an aggrieved minority who are losing at every turn : `` large majorities of both conservative Republicans ( 81 percent ) and moderate and liberal Republicans ( 75 percent ) say their political side loses more often than it wins . '' And heaven forbid they might compromise to get some of what they want . If they ca n't have it all , it 's not worth anything .\nNone of this is really news to anyone who 's been watching the presidential race unfold this year . The Trump phenomenon alone is enough to convince observers that while a large chunk of the Republican base is ticked off at just about everything -- especially immigrants , Muslims and President Obama . But what really makes them see red , and what Trump ( and to some extent Carson ) articulates the best , is the visceral loathing for what they call `` political correctness . '' ( That 's what what people used to call `` good manners '' or `` basic human decency . '' ) The social disapprobation against being rude and demeaning completely enrages them .\nSome conservatives openly defy any restriction on their God-given right to be puerile jerks :\n( Helen Keller jokes were considered gross and out of bounds even when I was a kid and that was long before the term `` political correctness '' existed . )\nRush Limbaugh , Mark Levin , Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham come to mind as similarly infantile and crude . But mostly they are screaming mad . They are the leaders of the angry right who have been stoking the discontent of their audiences for many years , creating the subculture of right wing rage that is finding its political expression in the candidacy of Donald Trump .\nNo less than the Wall Street Journal made note of their influence and how they 've managed to turn it against the very establishment that helped create them :\nConsider the folks who regularly tune in to conservative talk radio . These listeners expect a steady diet of Obama-bashing , so it \u2019 s hardly surprising that not one surveyed for a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in late October approved of the job Barack Obama is doing as president . That anger translates to how these Americans view the country as a whole . Some 98 % think the country is headed in the wrong direction , a view regularly reinforced on the airwaves by the likes of Rush Limbaugh , Mark Levin and other talk-radio hosts who don \u2019 t have much nice to say about GOP leaders in Washington , either . A decade ago , Republicans touted conservative talk radio as a foolproof medium to communicate directly with their most ardent supporters . Democrats and liberal groups tried to replicate that success by building their own left-leaning television and radio stations , with far less success . Now , the tables have turned . Republican leaders in Washington are under siege from their own activists , in part , because conservative radio hosts are almost as likely to rail against the party brass in Congress as they are to lament Mr. Obama \u2019 s failings in the Oval Office .\nThis is a switch from the days when Rush would have the whole Bush family on his show in 2008 so they could kiss each other 's rings :\nRUSH : What are ... ?
