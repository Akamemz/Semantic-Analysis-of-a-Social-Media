During the tirade, West told the audience he had not voted on November 8, but if he had he would have voted for Donald Trump. He also told fans he was preparing for a 2020 presidential run, but using a \u201cdifferent model\u201d to Trump. He argued that his support for Trump did not mean he didn\u2019t support women\u2019s rights or the Black Lives Matter movement, though he did tell the crowd that black people should \u201cstop focusing on racism.\u201d \u201cWe are in a racist country \u2013 period,\u201d West exclaimed, adding that talking about racism was a distraction o other issues, and that no presidential candidate was going to change that. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 This video has been uploaded for use by Storyful's subscription clients with the permission of the content owner.
