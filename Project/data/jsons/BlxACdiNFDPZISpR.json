    "content": "Challenged from all sides , the US is losing its tight grip on international power , Noam Chomsky writes , as world public opinion becomes a \u2018 second superpower \u2019\nWhen we ask \u201c who rules the world ? \u201d we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states , primarily the great powers , and we consider their decisions and the relations among them . That is not wrong . But we would do well to keep in mind that this level of abstraction can also be highly misleading .\nStates , of course , have complex internal structures , and the choices and decisions of the political leadership are heavily influenced by internal concentrations of power , while the general population is often marginalized . That is true even for the more democratic societies , and obviously for others . We can not gain a realistic understanding of who rules the world while ignoring the \u201c masters of mankind \u201d , as Adam Smith called them : in his day , the merchants and manufacturers of England ; in ours , multinational conglomerates , huge financial institutions , retail empires and the like .\nStill following Smith , it is also wise to attend to the \u201c vile maxim \u201d to which the \u201c masters of mankind \u201d are dedicated : \u201c All for ourselves and nothing for other people \u201d \u2013 a doctrine known otherwise as bitter and incessant class war , often one-sided , much to the detriment of the people of the home country and the world .\nIn the contemporary global order , the institutions of the masters hold enormous power , not only in the international arena but also within their home states , on which they rely to protect their power and to provide economic support by a wide variety of means .\nWhen we consider the role of the masters of mankind , we turn to such state policy priorities of the moment as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , one of the investor-rights agreements mislabeled \u201c free-trade agreements \u201d in propaganda and commentary . They are negotiated in secret , apart from the hundreds of corporate lawyers and lobbyists writing the crucial details . The intention is to have them adopted in good Stalinist style with \u201c fast track \u201d procedures designed to block discussion and allow only the choice of yes or no ( hence yes ) .\nThe designers regularly do quite well , not surprisingly . People are incidental , with the consequences one might anticipate .\nThe neoliberal programs of the past generation have concentrated wealth and power in far fewer hands while undermining functioning democracy , but they have aroused opposition as well , most prominently in Latin America but also in the centers of global power .\nThe European Union ( EU ) , one of the more promising developments of the post-world war II period , has been tottering because of the harsh effect of the policies of austerity during recession , condemned even by the economists of the International Monetary Fund ( if not the IMF \u2019 s political actors ) .\nDemocracy has been undermined as decision-making shifted to the Brussels bureaucracy , with the northern banks casting their shadow over their proceedings .\nMainstream parties have been rapidly losing members to left and to right . The executive director of the Paris-based research group EuropaNova attributes the general disenchantment to \u201c a mood of angry impotence as the real power to shape events largely shifted from national political leaders [ who , in principle at least , are subject to democratic politics ] to the market , the institutions of the European Union and corporations \u201d , quite in accord with neoliberal doctrine .\nVery similar processes are under way in the United States , for somewhat similar reasons , a matter of significance and concern not just for the country but , because of US power , for the world .\nThe rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention : it sets aside the public , which often fails to accept the approved role of \u201c spectators \u201d ( rather than \u201c participants \u201d ) assigned to it in liberal democratic theory . Such disobedience has always been of concern to the dominant classes . Just keeping to American history , George Washington regarded the common people who formed the militias that he was to command as \u201c an exceedingly dirty and nasty people [ evincing ] an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people \u201d .\nIn Violent Politics , his masterful review of insurgencies from \u201c the American insurgency \u201d to contemporary Afghanistan and Iraq , William Polk concludes that General Washington \u201c was so anxious to sideline [ the fighters he despised ] that he came close to losing the Revolution \u201d . Indeed , he \u201c might have actually done so \u201d had France not massively intervened and \u201c saved the Revolution \u201d , which until then had been won by guerrillas \u2013 whom we would now call \u201c terrorists \u201d \u2013 while Washington \u2019 s British-style army \u201c was defeated time after time and almost lost the war \u201d .\nIt is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect . That seems incorrect to me\nA common feature of successful insurgencies , Polk records , is that once popular support dissolves after victory , the leadership suppresses the \u201c dirty and nasty people \u201d who actually won the war with guerrilla tactics and terror , for fear that they might challenge class privilege . The elites \u2019 contempt for \u201c the lower class of these people \u201d has taken various forms throughout the years .\nIn recent times one expression of this contempt is the call for passivity and obedience ( \u201c moderation in democracy \u201d ) by liberal internationalists reacting to the dangerous democratizing effects of the popular movements of the 1960s .\nSometimes states do choose to follow public opinion , eliciting much fury in centers of power . One dramatic case was in 2003 , when the Bush administration called on Turkey to join its invasion of Iraq .\nNinety-five percent of Turks opposed that course of action and , to the amazement and horror of Washington , the Turkish government adhered to their views . Turkey was bitterly condemned for this departure from responsible behavior . Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , designated by the press as the \u201c idealist-in-chief \u201d of the administration , berated the Turkish military for permitting the malfeasance of the government and demanded an apology . Unperturbed by these and innumerable other illustrations of our fabled \u201c yearning for democracy \u201d , respectable commentary continued to laud President George W Bush for his dedication to \u201c democracy promotion \u201d , or sometimes criticized him for his naivete in thinking that an outside power could impose its democratic yearnings on others .\nThe Turkish public was not alone . Global opposition to US-UK aggression was overwhelming . Support for Washington \u2019 s war plans scarcely reached 10 % almost anywhere , according to international polls . Opposition sparked huge worldwide protests , in the United States as well , probably the first time in history that imperial aggression was strongly protested even before it was officially launched .\nOn the front page of the New York Times , journalist Patrick Tyler reported that \u201c there may still be two superpowers on the planet : the United States and world public opinion \u201d .\nUnprecedented protest in the US was a manifestation of the opposition to aggression that began decades earlier in the condemnation of the US wars in Indochina , reaching a scale that was substantial and influential , even if far too late .\nBy 1967 , when the antiwar movement was becoming a significant force , military historian and Vietnam specialist Bernard Fall warned that \u201c Vietnam as a cultural and historic entity \u2026 is threatened with extinction \u2026 [ as ] the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size \u201d .\nBut the antiwar movement did become a force that could not be ignored . Nor could it be ignored when Ronald Reagan came into office determined to launch an assault on Central America . His administration mimicked closely the steps John F Kennedy had taken 20 years earlier in launching the war against South Vietnam , but had to back off because of the kind of vigorous public protest that had been lacking in the early 1960s .\nThe assault was awful enough . The victims have yet to recover . But what happened to South Vietnam and later all of Indochina , where \u201c the second superpower \u201d imposed its impediments only much later in the conflict , was incomparably worse .\nIt is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect . That seems incorrect to me .\nAgain , the invasion was horrifying enough , and its aftermath is utterly grotesque . Nevertheless , it could have been far worse .\nVice-President Dick Cheney , secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld , and the rest of Bush \u2019 s top officials could never even contemplate the sort of measures that President Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson adopted 40 years earlier largely without protest .\nThere is far more to say , of course , about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs . But with such nontrivial caveats as these , let us nevertheless adopt the convention , at least as a first approximation to reality . Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China \u2019 s rise to power and its challenge to the US and \u201c world order \u201d , the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe , the global war on terror , American hegemony and American decline , and a range of similar considerations .\nThe challenges faced by western power at the outset of 2016 are usefully summarized within the conventional framework by Gideon Rachman , chief foreign-affairs columnist for the London Financial Times . He begins by reviewing the western picture of world order : \u201c Ever since the end of the cold war , the overwhelming power of the US military has been the central fact of international politics . \u201d\nThis is particularly crucial in three regions : east Asia , where \u201c the US navy has become used to treating the Pacific as an \u2018 American lake \u2019 \u201d ; Europe , where Nato \u2013 meaning the United States , which \u201c accounts for a staggering three-quarters of Nato \u2019 s military spending \u201d \u2013 \u201c guarantees the territorial integrity of its member states \u201d ; and the Middle East , where giant US naval and air bases \u201c exist to reassure friends and to intimidate rivals \u201d .\nThe problem of world order today , Rachman continues , is that \u201c these security orders are now under challenge in all three regions \u201d because of Russian intervention in Ukraine and Syria , and because of China turning its nearby seas from an American lake to \u201c clearly contested water \u201d .\nThe fundamental question of international relations , then , is whether the US should \u201c accept that other major powers should have some kind of zone of influence in their neighborhoods \u201d . Rachman thinks it should , for reasons of \u201c diffusion of economic power around the world \u2013 combined with simple common sense \u201d .\nThere are , to be sure , ways of looking at the world from different standpoints . But let us keep to these three regions , surely critically important ones .\nBeginning with the \u201c American lake \u201d , some eyebrows might be raised over the report in mid-December 2015 that \u201c an American B-52 bomber on a routine mission over the South China Sea unintentionally flew within two nautical miles of an artificial island built by China , senior defense officials said , exacerbating a hotly divisive issue for Washington and Beijing \u201d .\nThose familiar with the grim record of the 70 years of the nuclear weapons era will be all too aware that this is the kind of incident that has often come perilously close to igniting terminal nuclear war . One need not be a supporter of China \u2019 s provocative and aggressive actions in the South China Sea to notice that the incident did not involve a Chinese nuclear-capable bomber in the Caribbean , or off the coast of California , where China has no pretensions of establishing a \u201c Chinese lake \u201d . Luckily for the world .\nChinese leaders understand very well that their country \u2019 s maritime trade routes are ringed with hostile powers from Japan through the Malacca Straits and beyond , backed by overwhelming US military force . Accordingly , China is proceeding to expand westward with extensive investments and careful moves toward integration .\nIn part , these developments are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) , which includes the central Asian states and Russia , and soon India and Pakistan with Iran as one of the observers \u2013 a status that was denied to the US , which was also called on to close all military bases in the region . China is constructing a modernized version of the old silk roads , with the intent not only of integrating the region under Chinese influence , but also of reaching Europe and the Middle Eastern oil-producing regions . It is pouring huge sums into creating an integrated Asian energy and commercial system , with extensive high-speed rail lines and pipelines .\nOne element of the program is a highway through some of the world \u2019 s tallest mountains to the new Chinese-developed port of Gwadar in Pakistan , which will protect oil shipments from potential US interference .\nThe program may also , China and Pakistan hope , spur industrial development in Pakistan , which the United States has not undertaken despite massive military aid , and might also provide an incentive for Pakistan to clamp down on domestic terrorism , a serious issue for China in western Xinjiang province . Gwadar will be part of China \u2019 s \u201c string of pearls \u201d , bases being constructed in the Indian Ocean for commercial purposes but potentially also for military use , with the expectation that China might someday be able to project power as far as the Persian Gulf for the first time in the modern era .\nAll of these moves remain immune to Washington \u2019 s overwhelming military power , short of annihilation by nuclear war , which would destroy the US as well .\nIn 2015 , China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) , with itself as the main shareholder . Fifty-six nations participated in the opening in Beijing in June , including US allies Australia , Britain and others which joined in defiance of Washington \u2019 s wishes . The US and Japan were absent .\nSome analysts believe that the new bank might turn out to be a competitor to the Bretton Woods institutions ( the IMF and the World Bank ) , in which the United States holds veto power . There are also some expectations that the SCO might eventually become a counterpart to Nato .\nTurning to the second region , eastern Europe , there is a crisis brewing at the Nato-Russian border . It is no small matter .\nIn his illuminating and judicious scholarly study of the region , Frontline Ukraine : Crisis in the Borderlands , Richard Sakwa writes \u2013 all too plausibly \u2013 that the \u201c Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 was in effect the first of the \u2018 wars to stop Nato enlargement \u2019 ; the Ukraine crisis of 2014 is the second . It is not clear whether humanity would survive a third . \u201d\nThe west sees Nato enlargement as benign . Not surprisingly , Russia , along with much of the Global South , has a different opinion , as do some prominent western voices . George Kennan warned early on that Nato enlargement is a \u201c tragic mistake \u201d , and he was joined by senior American statesmen in an open letter to the White House describing it as a \u201c policy error of historic proportions \u201d .\nThe present crisis has its origins in 1991 , with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union . There were then two contrasting visions of a new security system and political economy in Eurasia . In Sakwa \u2019 s words , one vision was of a \u201c \u2018 Wider Europe \u2019 , with the EU at its heart but increasingly coterminous with the Euro-Atlantic security and political community ; and on the other side there [ was ] the idea of \u2018 Greater Europe \u2019 , a vision of a continental Europe , stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok , that has multiple centers , including Brussels , Moscow and Ankara , but with a common purpose in overcoming the divisions that have traditionally plagued the continent \u201d .\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was the major proponent of Greater Europe , a concept that also had European roots in Gaullism and other initiatives . However , as Russia collapsed under the devastating market reforms of the 1990s , the vision faded , only to be renewed as Russia began to recover and seek a place on the world stage under Vladimir Putin who , along with his associate Dmitry Medvedev , has repeatedly \u201c called for the geopolitical unification of all of \u2018 Greater Europe \u2019 from Lisbon to Vladivostok , to create a genuine \u2018 strategic partnership \u2019 \u201d .\nThese initiatives were \u201c greeted with polite contempt \u201d , Sakwa writes , regarded as \u201c little more than a cover for the establishment of a \u2018 Greater Russia \u2019 by stealth \u201d and an effort to \u201c drive a wedge \u201d between North America and western Europe . Such concerns trace back to earlier cold war fears that Europe might become a \u201c third force \u201d independent of both the great and minor superpowers and moving toward closer links to the latter ( as can be seen in Willy Brandt \u2019 s Ostpolitik and other initiatives ) .\nThe western response to Russia \u2019 s collapse was triumphalist . It was hailed as signaling \u201c the end of history \u201d , the final victory of western capitalist democracy , almost as if Russia were being instructed to revert to its pre-world war I status as a virtual economic colony of the west .\nNato enlargement began at once , in violation of verbal assurances to Gorbachev that Nato forces would not move \u201c one inch to the east \u201d after he agreed that a unified Germany could become a Nato member \u2013 a remarkable concession , in the light of history . That discussion kept to East Germany . The possibility that Nato might expand beyond Germany was not discussed with Gorbachev , even if privately considered .\nSoon , Nato did begin to move beyond , right to the borders of Russia . The general mission of Nato was officially changed to a mandate to protect \u201c crucial infrastructure \u201d of the global energy system , sea lanes and pipelines , giving it a global area of operations . Furthermore , under a crucial western revision of the now widely heralded doctrine of \u201c responsibility to protect \u201d , sharply different from the official UN version , Nato may now also serve as an intervention force under US command .\nOf particular concern to Russia are plans to expand Nato to Ukraine . These plans were articulated explicitly at the Bucharest Nato summit of April 2008 , when Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership in Nato . The wording was unambiguous : \u201c Nato welcomes Ukraine \u2019 s and Georgia \u2019 s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in Nato . We agreed today that these countries will become members of Nato . \u201d\nWith the \u201c Orange Revolution \u201d victory of pro-western candidates in Ukraine in 2004 , State Department representative Daniel Fried rushed there and \u201c emphasized US support for Ukraine \u2019 s Nato and Euro-Atlantic aspirations \u201d , as a WikiLeaks report revealed .\nAs in the case of China , one does not have to regard Putin \u2019 s moves favorably to understand the logic behind them\nRussia \u2019 s concerns are easily understandable . They are outlined by international relations scholar John Mearsheimer in the leading US establishment journal , Foreign Affairs . He writes that \u201c the taproot of the current crisis [ over Ukraine ] is Nato expansion and Washington \u2019 s commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscow \u2019 s orbit and integrate it into the west \u201d , which Putin viewed as \u201c a direct threat to Russia \u2019 s core interests \u201d .\n\u201c Who can blame him ? \u201d Mearsheimer asks , pointing out that \u201c Washington may not like Moscow \u2019 s position , but it should understand the logic behind it \u201d . That should not be too difficult . After all , as everyone knows , \u201c The United States does not tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces anywhere in the western hemisphere , much less on its borders . \u201d\nIn fact , the US stand is far stronger . It does not tolerate what is officially called \u201c successful defiance \u201d of the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 , which declared ( but could not yet implement ) US control of the hemisphere . And a small country that carries out such successful defiance may be subjected to \u201c the terrors of the earth \u201d and a crushing embargo \u2013 as happened to Cuba .\nWe need not ask how the United States would have reacted had the countries of Latin America joined the Warsaw Pact , with plans for Mexico and Canada to join as well . The merest hint of the first tentative steps in that direction would have been \u201c terminated with extreme prejudice \u201d , to adopt CIA lingo .\nAs in the case of China , one does not have to regard Putin \u2019 s moves and motives favorably to understand the logic behind them , nor to grasp the importance of understanding that logic instead of issuing imprecations against it . As in the case of China , a great deal is at stake , reaching as far \u2013 literally \u2013 as questions of survival .\nLet us turn to the third region of major concern , the ( largely ) Islamic world , also the scene of the global war on terror ( GWOT ) that George W Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack . To be more accurate , re-declared .\nThe GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office , with fevered rhetoric about a \u201c plague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself \u201d ( as Reagan put it ) and a \u201c return to barbarism in the modern age \u201d ( the words of George Shultz , his secretary of state ) .\nThe original GWOT has been quietly removed from history . It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America , southern Africa , and the Middle East , with grim repercussions to the present , even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court ( which Washington dismissed ) . In any event , it is not the right story for history , so it is gone .\nThe success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection . When the war was declared , the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan . They were protected by Afghans , who mostly disliked or despised them , under the tribal code of hospitality \u2013 which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused \u201c to turn over Osama bin Laden for the , to them , astronomical sum of $ 25m \u201d .\nThere are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action , or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban , might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing . But such options were off the table . Instead , the reflexive choice was large-scale violence \u2013 not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban ( that came later ) but to make clear US contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden .\nHow serious these offers were we do not know , since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained . Or perhaps the US was just intent on \u201c trying to show its muscle , score a victory and scare everyone in the world . They don \u2019 t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose \u201d .\nThat was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq , one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as \u201c a big setback \u201d for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within , a goal they considered within their reach .\nHis judgment is confirmed by Richard A Clarke , who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made . As Clarke describes the meeting , when informed that the attack would violate international law , \u201c the president yelled in the narrow conference room , \u2018 I don \u2019 t care what the international lawyers say , we are going to kick some ass. \u2019 \u201d The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan , who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous .\nThe consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed .\nThe US-UK invasion , utterly without credible pretext , is the major crime of the 21st century . The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as \u201c genocidal \u201d by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them , and resigned in protest for this reason . The invasion also generated millions of refugees , largely destroyed the country , and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region . It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called , blandly , \u201c the liberation of Iraq \u201d .\nPentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3 % of Iraqis regarded the US security role in their neighborhood as legitimate , less than 1 % believed that \u201c coalition \u201d ( US-UK ) forces were good for their security , 80 % opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country , and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops . Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling , but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well . Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat , abandoning its official war aims , and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor , Iran .\nThe sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere , notably in Libya , where the three traditional imperial powers ( Britain , France and the US ) procured security council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it , becoming the air force of the rebels .\nThe effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful , negotiated settlement ; sharply increase casualties ( by at least a factor of 10 , according to political scientist Alan Kuperman ) ; leave Libya in ruins , in the hands of warring militias ; and , more recently , to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond .\nQuite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union , accepted in principle by Libya \u2019 s Muammar Gaddafi , were ignored by the imperial triumvirate , as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews . A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from west Africa ( now the champion for terrorist murders ) to the Levant , while the Nato attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe .\nYet another triumph of \u201c humanitarian intervention \u201d , and , as the long and often ghastly record reveals , not an unusual one , going back to its modern origins four centuries ago .\nThis piece was first published on TomDispatch.com . This is part one of an overview essay from Noam Chomsky \u2019 s new book on American power and the world , Who Rules the World ?",
    "content_original": "Challenged from all sides, the US is losing its tight grip on international power, Noam Chomsky writes, as world public opinion becomes a \u2018second superpower\u2019\n\nWhen we ask \u201cwho rules the world?\u201d we commonly adopt the standard convention that the actors in world affairs are states, primarily the great powers, and we consider their decisions and the relations among them.

The executive director of the Paris-based research group EuropaNova attributes the general disenchantment to \u201ca mood of angry impotence as the real power to shape events largely shifted from national political leaders [who, in principle at least, are subject to democratic politics] to the market, the institutions of the European Union and corporations\u201d, quite in accord with neoliberal doctrine.\n\nVery similar processes are under way in the United States, for somewhat similar reasons, a matter of significance and concern not just for the country but, because of US power, for the world.\n\nThe rising opposition to the neoliberal assault highlights another crucial aspect of the standard convention: it sets aside the public, which often fails to accept the approved role of \u201cspectators\u201d (rather than \u201cparticipants\u201d) assigned to it in liberal democratic theory. Such disobedience has always been of concern to the dominant classes. Just keeping to American history, George Washington regarded the common people who formed the militias that he was to command as \u201can exceedingly dirty and nasty people [evincing] an unaccountable kind of stupidity in the lower class of these people\u201d.\n\nIn Violent Politics, his masterful review of insurgencies from \u201cthe American insurgency\u201d to contemporary Afghanistan and Iraq, William Polk concludes that General Washington \u201cwas so anxious to sideline [the fighters he despised] that he came close to losing the Revolution\u201d. Indeed, he \u201cmight have actually done so\u201d had France not massively intervened and \u201csaved the Revolution\u201d, which until then had been won by guerrillas \u2013 whom we would now call \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2013 while Washington\u2019s British-style army \u201cwas defeated time after time and almost lost the war\u201d.\n\nIt is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect. That seems incorrect to me\n\nA common feature of successful insurgencies, Polk records, is that once popular support dissolves after victory, the leadership suppresses the \u201cdirty and nasty people\u201d who actually won the war with guerrilla tactics and terror, for fear that they might challenge class privilege. The elites\u2019 contempt for \u201cthe lower class of these people\u201d has taken various forms throughout the years.\n\nIn recent times one expression of this contempt is the call for passivity and obedience (\u201cmoderation in democracy\u201d) by liberal internationalists reacting to the dangerous democratizing effects of the popular movements of the 1960s.\n\nSometimes states do choose to follow public opinion, eliciting much fury in centers of power. One dramatic case was in 2003, when the Bush administration called on Turkey to join its invasion of Iraq.\n\nNinety-five percent of Turks opposed that course of action and, to the amazement and horror of Washington, the Turkish government adhered to their views. Turkey was bitterly condemned for this departure from responsible behavior. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, designated by the press as the \u201cidealist-in-chief\u201d of the administration, berated the Turkish military for permitting the malfeasance of the government and demanded an apology. Unperturbed by these and innumerable other illustrations of our fabled \u201cyearning for democracy\u201d, respectable commentary continued to laud President George W Bush for his dedication to \u201cdemocracy promotion\u201d, or sometimes criticized him for his naivete in thinking that an outside power could impose its democratic yearnings on others.\n\nThe Turkish public was not alone. Global opposition to US-UK aggression was overwhelming. Support for Washington\u2019s war plans scarcely reached 10% almost anywhere, according to international polls. Opposition sparked huge worldwide protests, in the United States as well, probably the first time in history that imperial aggression was strongly protested even before it was officially launched.\n\nOn the front page of the New York Times, journalist Patrick Tyler reported that \u201cthere may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An anti-war protester lays next to a flag-draped mock casket outside the White House in 2016. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUnprecedented protest in the US was a manifestation of the opposition to aggression that began decades earlier in the condemnation of the US wars in Indochina, reaching a scale that was substantial and influential, even if far too late.\n\nBy 1967, when the antiwar movement was becoming a significant force, military historian and Vietnam specialist Bernard Fall warned that \u201cVietnam as a cultural and historic entity \u2026 is threatened with extinction \u2026 [as] the countryside literally dies under the blows of the largest military machine ever unleashed on an area of this size\u201d.\n\nBut the antiwar movement did become a force that could not be ignored. Nor could it be ignored when Ronald Reagan came into office determined to launch an assault on Central America. His administration mimicked closely the steps John F Kennedy had taken 20 years earlier in launching the war against South Vietnam, but had to back off because of the kind of vigorous public protest that had been lacking in the early 1960s.\n\nThe assault was awful enough. The victims have yet to recover. But what happened to South Vietnam and later all of Indochina, where \u201cthe second superpower\u201d imposed its impediments only much later in the conflict, was incomparably worse.\n\nIt is often argued that the enormous public opposition to the invasion of Iraq had no effect. That seems incorrect to me.\n\nAgain, the invasion was horrifying enough, and its aftermath is utterly grotesque. Nevertheless, it could have been far worse.\n\nVice-President Dick Cheney, secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld, and the rest of Bush\u2019s top officials could never even contemplate the sort of measures that President Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson adopted 40 years earlier largely without protest.\n\nWestern power under pressure\n\nThere is far more to say, of course, about the factors in determining state policy that are put to the side when we adopt the standard convention that states are the actors in international affairs. But with such nontrivial caveats as these, let us nevertheless adopt the convention, at least as a first approximation to reality. Then the question of who rules the world leads at once to such concerns as China\u2019s rise to power and its challenge to the US and \u201cworld order\u201d, the new cold war simmering in eastern Europe, the global war on terror, American hegemony and American decline, and a range of similar considerations.\n\nThe challenges faced by western power at the outset of 2016 are usefully summarized within the conventional framework by Gideon Rachman, chief foreign-affairs columnist for the London Financial Times. He begins by reviewing the western picture of world order: \u201cEver since the end of the cold war, the overwhelming power of the US military has been the central fact of international politics.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly crucial in three regions: east Asia, where \u201cthe US navy has become used to treating the Pacific as an \u2018American lake\u2019\u201d; Europe, where Nato \u2013 meaning the United States, which \u201caccounts for a staggering three-quarters of Nato\u2019s military spending\u201d \u2013 \u201cguarantees the territorial integrity of its member states\u201d; and the Middle East, where giant US naval and air bases \u201cexist to reassure friends and to intimidate rivals\u201d.\n\nThe problem of world order today, Rachman continues, is that \u201cthese security orders are now under challenge in all three regions\u201d because of Russian intervention in Ukraine and Syria, and because of China turning its nearby seas from an American lake to \u201cclearly contested water\u201d.\n\nThe fundamental question of international relations, then, is whether the US should \u201caccept that other major powers should have some kind of zone of influence in their neighborhoods\u201d. Rachman thinks it should, for reasons of \u201cdiffusion of economic power around the world \u2013 combined with simple common sense\u201d.\n\nThere are, to be sure, ways of looking at the world from different standpoints. But let us keep to these three regions, surely critically important ones.\n\nThe challenges today: east Asia\n\nBeginning with the \u201cAmerican lake\u201d, some eyebrows might be raised over the report in mid-December 2015 that \u201can American B-52 bomber on a routine mission over the South China Sea unintentionally flew within two nautical miles of an artificial island built by China, senior defense officials said, exacerbating a hotly divisive issue for Washington and Beijing\u201d.\n\nThose familiar with the grim record of the 70 years of the nuclear weapons era will be all too aware that this is the kind of incident that has often come perilously close to igniting terminal nuclear war. One need not be a supporter of China\u2019s provocative and aggressive actions in the South China Sea to notice that the incident did not involve a Chinese nuclear-capable bomber in the Caribbean, or off the coast of California, where China has no pretensions of establishing a \u201cChinese lake\u201d. Luckily for the world.\n\nChinese leaders understand very well that their country\u2019s maritime trade routes are ringed with hostile powers from Japan through the Malacca Straits and beyond, backed by overwhelming US military force. Accordingly, China is proceeding to expand westward with extensive investments and careful moves toward integration.\n\nIn part, these developments are within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which includes the central Asian states and Russia, and soon India and Pakistan with Iran as one of the observers \u2013 a status that was denied to the US, which was also called on to close all military bases in the region. China is constructing a modernized version of the old silk roads, with the intent not only of integrating the region under Chinese influence, but also of reaching Europe and the Middle Eastern oil-producing regions. It is pouring huge sums into creating an integrated Asian energy and commercial system, with extensive high-speed rail lines and pipelines.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018China might someday be able to project power as far as the Persian Gulf.\u2019 Photograph: Claro Cortes Iv/Reuters\n\nOne element of the program is a highway through some of the world\u2019s tallest mountains to the new Chinese-developed port of Gwadar in Pakistan, which will protect oil shipments from potential US interference.\n\nThe program may also, China and Pakistan hope, spur industrial development in Pakistan, which the United States has not undertaken despite massive military aid, and might also provide an incentive for Pakistan to clamp down on domestic terrorism, a serious issue for China in western Xinjiang province. Gwadar will be part of China\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d, bases being constructed in the Indian Ocean for commercial purposes but potentially also for military use, with the expectation that China might someday be able to project power as far as the Persian Gulf for the first time in the modern era.\n\nAll of these moves remain immune to Washington\u2019s overwhelming military power, short of annihilation by nuclear war, which would destroy the US as well.\n\nIn 2015, China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), with itself as the main shareholder. Fifty-six nations participated in the opening in Beijing in June, including US allies Australia, Britain and others which joined in defiance of Washington\u2019s wishes. The US and Japan were absent.\n\nSome analysts believe that the new bank might turn out to be a competitor to the Bretton Woods institutions (the IMF and the World Bank), in which the United States holds veto power. There are also some expectations that the SCO might eventually become a counterpart to Nato.\n\nThe challenges today: eastern Europe\n\nTurning to the second region, eastern Europe, there is a crisis brewing at the Nato-Russian border. It is no small matter.\n\nIn his illuminating and judicious scholarly study of the region, Frontline Ukraine: Crisis in the Borderlands, Richard Sakwa writes \u2013 all too plausibly \u2013 that the \u201cRusso-Georgian war of August 2008 was in effect the first of the \u2018wars to stop Nato enlargement\u2019; the Ukraine crisis of 2014 is the second. It is not clear whether humanity would survive a third.\u201d\n\nThe west sees Nato enlargement as benign. Not surprisingly, Russia, along with much of the Global South, has a different opinion, as do some prominent western voices. George Kennan warned early on that Nato enlargement is a \u201ctragic mistake\u201d, and he was joined by senior American statesmen in an open letter to the White House describing it as a \u201cpolicy error of historic proportions\u201d.\n\nThe present crisis has its origins in 1991, with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. There were then two contrasting visions of a new security system and political economy in Eurasia. In Sakwa\u2019s words, one vision was of a \u201c\u2018Wider Europe\u2019, with the EU at its heart but increasingly coterminous with the Euro-Atlantic security and political community; and on the other side there [was] the idea of \u2018Greater Europe\u2019, a vision of a continental Europe, stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok, that has multiple centers, including Brussels, Moscow and Ankara, but with a common purpose in overcoming the divisions that have traditionally plagued the continent\u201d.\n\nSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was the major proponent of Greater Europe, a concept that also had European roots in Gaullism and other initiatives. However, as Russia collapsed under the devastating market reforms of the 1990s, the vision faded, only to be renewed as Russia began to recover and seek a place on the world stage under Vladimir Putin who, along with his associate Dmitry Medvedev, has repeatedly \u201ccalled for the geopolitical unification of all of \u2018Greater Europe\u2019 from Lisbon to Vladivostok, to create a genuine \u2018strategic partnership\u2019\u201d.\n\nThese initiatives were \u201cgreeted with polite contempt\u201d, Sakwa writes, regarded as \u201clittle more than a cover for the establishment of a \u2018Greater Russia\u2019 by stealth\u201d and an effort to \u201cdrive a wedge\u201d between North America and western Europe. Such concerns trace back to earlier cold war fears that Europe might become a \u201cthird force\u201d independent of both the great and minor superpowers and moving toward closer links to the latter (as can be seen in Willy Brandt\u2019s Ostpolitik and other initiatives).\n\nThe western response to Russia\u2019s collapse was triumphalist. It was hailed as signaling \u201cthe end of history\u201d, the final victory of western capitalist democracy, almost as if Russia were being instructed to revert to its pre-world war I status as a virtual economic colony of the west.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin before a meeting at the UN General Assembly in 2015. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nNato enlargement began at once, in violation of verbal assurances to Gorbachev that Nato forces would not move \u201cone inch to the east\u201d after he agreed that a unified Germany could become a Nato member \u2013 a remarkable concession, in the light of history. That discussion kept to East Germany. The possibility that Nato might expand beyond Germany was not discussed with Gorbachev, even if privately considered.\n\nSoon, Nato did begin to move beyond, right to the borders of Russia. The general mission of Nato was officially changed to a mandate to protect \u201ccrucial infrastructure\u201d of the global energy system, sea lanes and pipelines, giving it a global area of operations. Furthermore, under a crucial western revision of the now widely heralded doctrine of \u201cresponsibility to protect\u201d, sharply different from the official UN version, Nato may now also serve as an intervention force under US command.\n\nOf particular concern to Russia are plans to expand Nato to Ukraine. These plans were articulated explicitly at the Bucharest Nato summit of April 2008, when Georgia and Ukraine were promised eventual membership in Nato. The wording was unambiguous: \u201cNato welcomes Ukraine\u2019s and Georgia\u2019s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in Nato. We agreed today that these countries will become members of Nato.\u201d\n\nWith the \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d victory of pro-western candidates in Ukraine in 2004, State Department representative Daniel Fried rushed there and \u201cemphasized US support for Ukraine\u2019s Nato and Euro-Atlantic aspirations\u201d, as a WikiLeaks report revealed.\n\nAs in the case of China, one does not have to regard Putin\u2019s moves favorably to understand the logic behind them\n\nRussia\u2019s concerns are easily understandable. They are outlined by international relations scholar John Mearsheimer in the leading US establishment journal, Foreign Affairs. He writes that \u201cthe taproot of the current crisis [over Ukraine] is Nato expansion and Washington\u2019s commitment to move Ukraine out of Moscow\u2019s orbit and integrate it into the west\u201d, which Putin viewed as \u201ca direct threat to Russia\u2019s core interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cWho can blame him?\u201d Mearsheimer asks, pointing out that \u201cWashington may not like Moscow\u2019s position, but it should understand the logic behind it\u201d. That should not be too difficult. After all, as everyone knows, \u201cThe United States does not tolerate distant great powers deploying military forces anywhere in the western hemisphere, much less on its borders.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the US stand is far stronger. It does not tolerate what is officially called \u201csuccessful defiance\u201d of the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which declared (but could not yet implement) US control of the hemisphere. And a small country that carries out such successful defiance may be subjected to \u201cthe terrors of the earth\u201d and a crushing embargo \u2013 as happened to Cuba.\n\nWe need not ask how the United States would have reacted had the countries of Latin America joined the Warsaw Pact, with plans for Mexico and Canada to join as well. The merest hint of the first tentative steps in that direction would have been \u201cterminated with extreme prejudice\u201d, to adopt CIA lingo.\n\nAs in the case of China, one does not have to regard Putin\u2019s moves and motives favorably to understand the logic behind them, nor to grasp the importance of understanding that logic instead of issuing imprecations against it. As in the case of China, a great deal is at stake, reaching as far \u2013 literally \u2013 as questions of survival.\n\nThe challenges today: the Islamic world\n\nLet us turn to the third region of major concern, the (largely) Islamic world, also the scene of the global war on terror (GWOT) that George W Bush declared in 2001 after the 9/11 terrorist attack. To be more accurate, re-declared.\n\nThe GWOT was declared by the Reagan administration when it took office, with fevered rhetoric about a \u201cplague spread by depraved opponents of civilization itself\u201d (as Reagan put it) and a \u201creturn to barbarism in the modern age\u201d (the words of George Shultz, his secretary of state).\n\nThe original GWOT has been quietly removed from history. It very quickly turned into a murderous and destructive terrorist war afflicting Central America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, with grim repercussions to the present, even leading to condemnation of the United States by the World Court (which Washington dismissed). In any event, it is not the right story for history, so it is gone.\n\nThe success of the Bush-Obama version of GWOT can readily be evaluated on direct inspection. When the war was declared, the terrorist targets were confined to a small corner of tribal Afghanistan. They were protected by Afghans, who mostly disliked or despised them, under the tribal code of hospitality \u2013 which baffled Americans when poor peasants refused \u201cto turn over Osama bin Laden for the, to them, astronomical sum of $25m\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marines pick out enemy targets as they receive incoming fire in Main Poshteh, Afghanistan. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that a well-constructed police action, or even serious diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban, might have placed those suspected of the 9/11 crimes in American hands for trial and sentencing. But such options were off the table. Instead, the reflexive choice was large-scale violence \u2013 not with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban (that came later) but to make clear US contempt for tentative Taliban offers of the possible extradition of bin Laden.\n\nHow serious these offers were we do not know, since the possibility of exploring them was never entertained. Or perhaps the US was just intent on \u201ctrying to show its muscle, score a victory and scare everyone in the world. They don\u2019t care about the suffering of the Afghans or how many people we will lose\u201d.\n\nThat was the judgment of the highly respected anti-Taliban leader Abdul Haq, one of the many oppositionists who condemned the American bombing campaign launched in October 2001 as \u201ca big setback\u201d for their efforts to overthrow the Taliban from within, a goal they considered within their reach.\n\nHis judgment is confirmed by Richard A Clarke, who was chairman of the Counterterrorism Security Group at the White House under President George W Bush when the plans to attack Afghanistan were made. As Clarke describes the meeting, when informed that the attack would violate international law, \u201cthe president yelled in the narrow conference room, \u2018I don\u2019t care what the international lawyers say, we are going to kick some ass.\u2019\u201d The attack was also bitterly opposed by the major aid organizations working in Afghanistan, who warned that millions were on the verge of starvation and that the consequences might be horrendous.\n\nThe consequences for poor Afghanistan years later need hardly be reviewed.\n\nThe next target of the sledgehammer was Iraq.\n\nThe US-UK invasion, utterly without credible pretext, is the major crime of the 21st century. The invasion led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people in a country where the civilian society had already been devastated by American and British sanctions that were regarded as \u201cgenocidal\u201d by the two distinguished international diplomats who administered them, and resigned in protest for this reason. The invasion also generated millions of refugees, largely destroyed the country, and instigated a sectarian conflict that is now tearing apart Iraq and the entire region. It is an astonishing fact about our intellectual and moral culture that in informed and enlightened circles it can be called, blandly, \u201cthe liberation of Iraq\u201d.\n\nPentagon and British Ministry of Defense polls found that only 3% of Iraqis regarded the US security role in their neighborhood as legitimate, less than 1% believed that \u201ccoalition\u201d (US-UK) forces were good for their security, 80% opposed the presence of coalition forces in the country, and a majority supported attacks on coalition troops. Afghanistan has been destroyed beyond the possibility of reliable polling, but there are indications that something similar may be true there as well. Particularly in Iraq the United States suffered a severe defeat, abandoning its official war aims, and leaving the country under the influence of the sole victor, Iran.\n\nThe sledgehammer was also wielded elsewhere, notably in Libya, where the three traditional imperial powers (Britain, France and the US) procured security council resolution 1973 and instantly violated it, becoming the air force of the rebels.\n\nThe effect was to undercut the possibility of a peaceful, negotiated settlement; sharply increase casualties (by at least a factor of 10, according to political scientist Alan Kuperman); leave Libya in ruins, in the hands of warring militias; and, more recently, to provide the Islamic State with a base that it can use to spread terror beyond.\n\nQuite sensible diplomatic proposals by the African Union, accepted in principle by Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi, were ignored by the imperial triumvirate, as Africa specialist Alex de Waal reviews. A huge flow of weapons and jihadis has spread terror and violence from west Africa (now the champion for terrorist murders) to the Levant, while the Nato attack also sent a flood of refugees from Africa to Europe.\n\nYet another triumph of \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d, and, as the long and often ghastly record reveals, not an unusual one, going back to its modern origins four centuries ago.\n\nThis piece was first published on TomDispatch.com.
