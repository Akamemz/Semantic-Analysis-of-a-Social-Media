    "content": "Given public esteem for veterans , the campaign holds potential to influence civilian attitudes about gun safety as well . \u201c Everybody struggles \u2013 everybody , \u201d says Mr. Vargas . \u201c So as veterans , because of how we \u2019 re seen by the country , we have a chance to make a difference . \u201d\nThe fraught debate on firearms and a political stalemate that has blocked almost all public funding for gun violence research have made clinicians reluctant to bring up gun safety with suicidal patients . But suicide rates for veterans and the overall population have climbed over the past 20 years , giving impetus to the push to encourage everything from trigger locks to off-site gun storage .\nFormer Marine Brian Vargas was desperately rummaging through a box to find the key to unlock his gun and take his own life when he ran across photos of his wife and pieces of shrapnel that nearly killed him in Iraq . His despair lessened . He put down his gun and went on , instead , to found a suicide prevention program for veterans in the San Francisco Bay Area , emphasizing gun safety . The Department of Veterans Affairs is using a similar emphasis as part of its suicide prevention efforts .\nThe depression that settled over Tyler Solorio after his combat tour in Afghanistan gave rise to dark thoughts . He attended counseling at a Veterans Affairs clinic in his hometown of Modesto , California , where he had returned in 2012 following a yearlong deployment with the Army National Guard . Therapists prescribed medication to level out his moods and subdue his suicidal impulses , yet as he recalls , none of them ever asked if he owned a firearm .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a difficult conversation that a lot of clinicians don \u2019 t necessarily want to have , \u201d Mr. Solorio says . \u201c But I wish someone had brought it up because I was a risk to myself at times . \u201d\nThe polarized tenor of the country \u2019 s gun debate complicates the question of how \u2013 or whether \u2013 private clinicians and those at the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) discuss firearms with patients struggling with a mental health crisis . Raising the topic with combat veterans poses a thornier dilemma for therapists because of the life-or-death bond that troops form with their weapons in a war zone .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like a security blanket \u2013 it \u2019 s always with you , \u201d says Mr. Solorio , who belonged to an infantry unit . After coming home , he found that keeping a gun close at hand offered solace as he coped with panic attacks that provoked fear of imaginary threats . \u201c It took the edge off because I knew I could protect myself . \u201d\nGuns rank as the most lethal method of suicide , with 9 in 10 attempts proving fatal . Almost 70 % of veterans who take their own lives use a firearm \u2013 compared with about half of civilians who die by suicide \u2013 and one-third of former service members store guns loaded and unlocked in their homes .\nIn response , the VA has sought to promote firearm safety as part of its campaign to reduce suicide risk , urging veterans to consider precautions that include gun locks , removing a gun \u2019 s firing pin , or storing firearms outside the home .\nThe safety measures can slow a person \u2019 s ability to follow through on suicidal thoughts and preempt an irrevocable choice , explains Matt Miller , the VA \u2019 s acting director for suicide prevention . Research shows that 70 % of suicide attempts occur within an hour of a person deciding to act on the idea ; a quarter occur in less than five minutes .\n\u201c We know that creating more time and space within those impulsive periods can allow for a change of heart , \u201d he says . \u201c If we can buy some time , that can be life-saving . \u201d\nSuicide rates for veterans and the overall population have climbed over the past 20 years , and more than 6,100 former service members died by their own hand in 2017 . Mental health researchers suggest that , given the public \u2019 s esteem for veterans , the VA campaign holds potential to influence civilian attitudes about lethal means safety as a deterrent to suicide .\n\u201c Veterans are venerated in our society , \u201d says Dr. Joseph Simonetti , an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who has studied gun storage habits among veterans and civilians . \u201c To the extent that they make changes in their approach to gun safety , that could have an effect on the rest of the country . \u201d\nA survey last year of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans with mental health needs revealed that 20 % worried that seeking care from the VA could result in confiscation of their firearms .\nThe concern arises from the agency \u2019 s authority to provide a veteran \u2019 s records to the FBI for inclusion in its system of national background checks for gun purchases . Federal reports show that such referrals , based on a finding of \u201c mental incompetency , \u201d occur in less than 1 % of patient cases .\nThe misgivings among veterans hinder the VA \u2019 s efforts to persuade more of them to receive treatment and add to the complexity of discussing firearms with those in crisis . Clinicians work to defuse their wariness by framing gun safety as a self-preservation tactic that aligns with the military training principle of injury prevention . Several studies link unsafe gun storage to elevated suicide risk across demographic groups , including active-duty soldiers .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not talking about restrictions , \u201d Mr. Miller says . \u201c We \u2019 re talking about safety . \u201d\nA firearm can represent something akin to a fifth limb to veterans . The sense of attachment presents a chance for therapists to discuss secure storage practices as one element in a regimen of practical self-care . Dr. Simonetti likens the decision to apply a gun lock or stow a firearm outside the home to choosing to take medication or attend counseling .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been treating gun safety as a separate issue , \u201d he says . \u201c But it should be integrated into an overall course of care . \u201d\nBroaching guns in the context of injury prevention enables behavioral health providers to learn about the storage habits of their patients . Craig Bryan , who leads the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah , advises his team of clinicians to pose open-ended inquiries to elicit relevant details .\n\u201c We often ask questions like \u2018 How do you typically store your guns ? \u2019 and \u2018 Why do you store your guns that way ? \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Bryan , an Air Force veteran who deployed to Iraq in 2009 . Contrary to the common assumption that veterans will recoil from considering precautions , he adds , \u201c I \u2019 ve found that , on the whole , they \u2019 re open to the idea . \u201d\nIn a recent VA study , three-quarters of veterans receiving mental health care at its medical facilities endorsed at least one of four voluntary options for limiting access to their firearms . The choices ranged from clinicians providing guidance to a veteran \u2019 s family members on safe storage to VA programs for storing or disposing of guns .\nThe agency \u2019 s growing emphasis on firearm safety draws support from Mr. Solorio , a policy analyst with Swords to Plowshares , a veterans advocacy organization based in San Francisco . His generation has borne much of the burden of the country \u2019 s 21st-century wars , and he falls within the age group \u2013 18 to 34 \u2013 that had the highest suicide rate among veterans in 2017 .\n\u201c Guns are such a delicate topic . But they need to be talked about , \u201d he says . \u201c Too many of us are being lost here at home . \u201d\nResearchers with the American College of Physicians estimate that 4 in 5 doctors never raise gun safety measures with patients at risk of suicide . Their reluctance stems from the country \u2019 s fraught debate on firearms and the political stalemate that has blocked almost all public funding for gun violence research since the mid-1990s .\nThe excess of rancor and lack of fresh data have sown uncertainty among doctors about how to identify and treat patients who present a threat to themselves . As Dr. Simonetti says , \u201c We learned a lot about diabetes prevention in medical school . We didn \u2019 t hear anything about gun violence prevention . \u201d\nBetween 1999 and 2017 , suicides by firearm rose 44 % nationwide , increasing from 16,599 to 23,854 . In the view of mental health clinicians , the VA \u2019 s advocacy for lethal means safety \u2013 an effort that extends to disposal of surplus and unneeded medication \u2013 could prove vital to reversing the trend .\nMr. Bryan suggests that the lofty perch veterans occupy in American culture , coupled with evidence-based studies showing a correlation between gun safety and lower suicide risk , creates an opportunity for a more enlightened , less combative national discussion about firearms and suicide prevention .\n\u201c Military personnel and veterans are perceived to be especially knowledgeable about these issues , \u201d he says . An embrace of secure storage practices by more veterans \u201c could catalyze a much needed shift in our broader society that could save a lot of lives . \u201d\nThe example set by former service members could ease the trepidation of doctors who hesitate to ask patients in crisis about their access to guns at home . Dr. Christopher Barsotti has confronted that scenario as an emergency physician at hospitals in western Massachusetts and southern Vermont .\n\u201c Veterans can bring credibility to the idea of being safe and responsible with guns , \u201d says Dr. Barsotti , co-founder of the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine , or AFFIRM . The Massachusetts nonprofit is one of several research groups formed by physicians in recent years that approach gun violence as a public health crisis . \u201c That could open up the conversation around firearms and preventing suicide , \u201d he says .\nThe scourge of suicide almost claimed Brian Vargas .
