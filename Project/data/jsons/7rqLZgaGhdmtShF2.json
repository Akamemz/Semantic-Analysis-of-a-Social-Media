( Lucas Jackson/Reuters )\nRarely have you seen a Democratic presidential-primary debate where the interests of the candidates and the interests of the moderators were so at odds . CNN \u2019 s questioners wanted specific answers in a one-minute window . Most of the candidates wanted to pivot to their preferred messages \u2014 illegal immigrants are human beings too , I care about your health and insurance companies don \u2019 t , Trump is just the worst , etc . The words uttered most frequently tonight were a loud , sudden , interrupting \u201c thank you , Senator ! \u201d from the moderators .\nWith 60-second time limits on answers , the responses were brief and not all that illuminating . Most veteran debaters either deliberately or reflexively insert generic phrases such as \u201c we need a real solution \u201d or \u201c this is about who we are as Americans \u201d or \u201c we can \u2019 t get distracted , we need to focus on the American people \u201d or some such blather . CNN ( and much of the audience ) wanted to see lively and spirited disagreement , and few candidates had any time to really get their arguments rolling .\nCNN clearly also wanted the candidates to contrast with each other , and a handful of previously not-so-noticed , more moderate candidates came to play : Representative John Delaney , Montana governor Steve Bullock , former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper , Representative Tim Ryan . The bad news for these guys is that they amount to about 5 percent combined right now , and it \u2019 s hard to see any one of them breaking out , just based upon tonight .\nA lot of us are laughing about Marianne Williamson , but there \u2019 s some of that same dynamic that drove Trump to the nomination in 2016 . She \u2019 s a figure who \u2019 s famous for being connected to the entertainment world , who isn \u2019 t interested in policy details , and who emotes in a way that generates raucous applause from the audience . She \u2019 s the political candidate for people who aren \u2019 t that into politics . Ben Smith of BuzzFeed mentioned that a Marianne Williamson staffer told him , \u201c when she visits the networks , reporters and producers sneer at her , but the makeup artists always cry when they meet her . \u201d\nAnd her lack of interest in policy means she \u2019 s always talking about bigger , vaguer , more emotionally resonant themes in her own kooky way : \u201c This is part of the dark underbelly of American society , the rainfall , the bigotry , and the entire conversation that we \u2019 re having here tonight , if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country , then I \u2019 m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days. \u201d A chunk of the American people is going to find talk about \u201c dark psychic force \u201d as crystal-waving nonsense . Another chunk of the American people is going to hear Williamson and respond , \u201c finally , a candidate is addressing the real problem . \u201d\nSometimes her criticisms of her rivals on stage were nonsensical \u2014 \u201c I look at some of you and I almost wonder why you \u2019 re Democrats , you almost think something is wrong with using the instruments of government to help people \u201d \u2014 but they generated applause anyway , which should have those other nine candidates on stage freaking out right now .\nIt \u2019 s the second debate and already Bernie Sanders is exhausting . Why does he feel the need to shout every single sentence ? Every answer , on every topic , he sounded like he wasn \u2019 t sure if his microphone was working . ( Ryan had an okay delivery of a good line when he said to Sanders , \u201c you don \u2019 t have to shout. \u201d ) Sanders is the equivalent of getting e-mails from your great-uncle who FORGETS THAT HE HAD THE CAPS LOCK KEY DOWN . Also , I get the feeling a lot of Democratic officials have gotten sick and tired of Bernie \u2019 s holier-than-thou \u201c I \u2019 m the only one who is willing to be bold and stand up for the people \u201d schtick , particularly when he wasn \u2019 t formally a Democrat for most of his career .\nOn paper , Elizabeth Warren won , in the sense that she got through the night without any major gaffes . A lot of liberals will love her for her quip , \u201c I don \u2019 t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running to the president of the United States to talk about what we really can \u2019 t do and shouldn \u2019 t fight for. \u201d Of course , she \u2019 s celebrating one of the big problems in our political system \u2014 no presidential candidate wants to acknowledge the limits of the power of the office , the presence of the opposition party , judicial review , the inherent difficulties of enacting sweeping changes through legislation , or the limit of government policy to solve problems in society . One of the reasons Americans are so cynical is that they \u2019 ve seen plenty of politicians come and go , with almost every one of them promising the moon and very few living up to the hype .\nWarren shamelessly insisted that the government could pay for quality health care for every American \u2014 and illegal immigrants , too ! \u2014 just by raising taxes on billionaires and big corporations .
