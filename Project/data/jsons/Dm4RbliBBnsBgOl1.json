But it doesn \u2019 t portend victory . As Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes summed up Bannon \u2019 s appointment : \u201c Trump \u2019 s campaign has now entered the Hospice Phase . He knows he \u2019 s dying and wants to surround himself with his loved ones . \u201d\nThings could naturally change , because things always change . ( The debates are still over a month away . ) But defeat is in the air . Recently I tried to tease out what Hillary Clinton \u2019 s five-year plan might be . But what about the five-year plan for Trump ? Is there even one ?\nWe can say this much : even if Trump is elected , he \u2019 s unlikely to gun for a second term , and that \u2019 s not just because of how chaotic the first term would be . He would already be history \u2019 s oldest first-term president to take office , and , for all the comparisons to Mussolini , Trump has never betrayed a love of politics or lust for political power . He has also hinted at a one-term maximum . A few weeks ago , after Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump in Cleveland , Trump suggested that an endorsement would have left Cruz \u201c in better shape for four years from now. \u201d That adds up only if A ) you think you \u2019 ll lose , or B ) one term is your limit .\n\u201c Trump has flirted with financial disaster before , and he might be doing so again . If that \u2019 s the case , he \u2019 s either thinking about how to pull out of the dive or , if it \u2019 s too late , how to spin the coming crash . \u201d\n( That \u2019 s only small comfort to Trump \u2019 s enemies , of course . Presidents can do a lot in a short span . George W. Bush managed to pack budget deficits , ABM treaty withdrawal , two wars , Guantanamo , and Abu Ghraib into one busy term . But true tyrants start politics young and stick around forever , or at least until they \u2019 re executed and hung upside down in Milan . Trump is starting too late for that sort of career . )\nIf he wins , Trump is clear on two points : he intends to build a border wall , and he \u2019 ll push to revisit trade agreements . Beyond that , he is vague . Given how few efforts Trump has made to bone up on policy so far , he probably plans to listen to advisors for a few minutes and wing it . In foreign policy , the realm in which he frightens people most , Trump is a question mark , perhaps also unto himself . He rejects interventionism in theory but shows none of the self-control and coolness that such a stance requires in the face of inevitable foreign provocations , and he seems to have eschewed non-interventionists as advisors . He might like to put together a peace deal for Israel , but there are few signs that he thinks about it much .\nGiven his ego and his business interests , Trump has probably been thinking as much about a post-loss future as a post-victory one . That \u2019 s especially likely if he \u2019 s in financial trouble , a real possibility . Trump \u2019 s cheapness\u2014so fanatical that only repeated prodding by a journalist could get him to honor a million-dollar charitable pledge that Trump claimed he \u2019 d already paid\u2014suggests there is something more than ordinary cost consciousness at work .

Now , nobody , not even Trump , would go through the hell of running a presidential race simply to start a television network . But starting a cable network might at least allow Trump to salvage some money and dignity after his loss .
