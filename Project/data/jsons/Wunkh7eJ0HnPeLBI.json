That made her and her family members eligible for the only prize they were ever really after , according to Sun and immigration experts : A green card known to bureaucrats and applicants as the \u201c U \u201d visa , which would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and ultimately gain citizenship .\nImmigrants , whether legal or illegal , may apply for the U visa if they are victims of certain crimes , including stalking and domestic violence , and if they help law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution . The U visa , created as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 , allows the alleged victims to remain in the U.S. while assisting law enforcement , and they can then become eligible to adjust to lawful permanent resident status .\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security , the U visa is in place largely to protect women and children who may be victims of crimes such as human trafficking , domestic violence , sexual assault and other abuse , but are afraid to report the crimes due to factors including the language barrier , cultural differences , lack of knowledge of U.S. laws and deportation fears .\nFormer Arapahoe County ( Colo. ) District Attorney Michael Steinberg , who now specializes in such cases , said , `` anyone who enters the country illegally and can produce a restraining order or affidavit , even with no hard evidence of abuse , is likely to be approved for a work permit and permanent residency .
