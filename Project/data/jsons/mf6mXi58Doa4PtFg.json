    "content": "Four in 10 Democratic insiders in the early states warn that Hillary Clinton is not spending enough time on the campaign trail , making her vulnerable to possible challenges from the left and dampening the enthusiasm of progressives who are already committed to her .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus \u2014 our weekly bipartisan pulse-taking of the most important activists , operatives and elected officials in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 also finds Democrats almost evenly divided over whether Clinton needs to take a firmer position on the trade battle that \u2019 s gripped Washington this week , but many approve of Bill Clinton \u2019 s efforts to be a more silent partner in his wife \u2019 s campaign .\nClinton will return to Iowa and New Hampshire next week , amidst an aggressive fundraising swing . Her campaign said Thursday that the events will again be small and relatively private .\nBut insiders are clamoring for the former secretary of state to do more events that allow more voters to see her in person . There \u2019 s a pervasive belief that her campaign stops need to feel more authentic and open in order to fire up the base .\n\u201c She needs to step it up dramatically , \u201d said a pro-Clinton Iowa Democrat , who \u2014 like all 77 respondents \u2014 completed the questionnaire anonymously in order to speak candidly .\n\u201c We have this need to feel well-loved every four years , \u201d said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c If other candidates begin to make inroads , Clinton \u2019 s absence will be noted . \u201d\nSeveral Democrats said she should headline a rally or give a major speech soon . One key Democrat in Iowa , where she finished third in 2008 , explained that \u201c a big open-attendance event would go a long way because it would at least let people actually see her \u201d in person .\nTo escape the media scrum , a New Hampshire Democrat suggested Clinton show up unannounced in the less populous North Country . \u201c Drop in on breakfast at a couple local spots , and then let word trickle out , \u201d the uncommitted activist said . \u201c She can spend a few hours doing very normal , hassle-free retail campaigning and then hold some kind of press avail later in the day . \u201d\nOn the other hand , a lot of Democrats joked that their friends will never be satisfied no matter how much time Hillary puts in on the ground . \u201c There is more concern out there among Democrats than I would have thought , \u201d said one in New Hampshire . \u201c People feel freer to voice their concerns about the Big Crash that everyone thinks will happen to her campaign . \u201d\nSome establishment Democrats think there \u2019 s little upside to mixing it up at this stage , and they believe that the press is obsessed only with asking gotcha questions . \u201c The less time she can spend on the campaign trail , the better , \u201d said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c Events bring a lot of unwelcome attacks , \u201d said another . \u201c She \u2019 s on the money trail now , \u201d said a pro-Clinton Democrat in Iowa . \u201c There is time in the fall to wear out her shoes . \u201d\nEven some who want her on the trail more note a massive influx of field staff over the past month . \u201c In Des Moines , I always see three or four of them meeting for coffee at the Smokey Row coffee house , \u201d said a Democrat , referring to local hangout . \u201c As a matter of fact , the O \u2019 Malley guy hangs out there too ! \u201d\nSeven in 10 Republicans said Clinton spends too little time campaigning . \u201c But when she does , she is so horrible , dull , scripted and phony that the Hillary juggernaut should create plans to build a soundproof Rose Garden in Brooklyn , \u201d said a Granite Stater .\n\u201c Just about every other day I run into a Democrat who says , \u2018 Jeez , your side is having all the fun , \u2019 \u201d said an Iowan .\nOne-third of GOP insiders said she \u2019 s smart to limit her appearances .\n\u201c She has no credible opponents , \u201d said a New Hampshire Republican . \u201c She could hibernate for the next 10 months and be totally absent from the campaign trail . And still be fine . \u201d\nHere are eight other takeaways from this 14th edition of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus :\nJeb \u2019 s fumbling of questions about Iraq reminds insiders of Bush-name baggage .\nIt took until Thursday for Bush to clarify that , knowing now about intelligence failures in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq , authorized by his brother , he would not have gone to war there . Earlier this week , he dismissed that question as a \u201c hypothetical \u201d \u2014 a position that three-quarters of Republican insiders called problematic .\nSeveral insiders think the kerfuffle will make it harder for Bush to distance himself from his brother , former President George W. Bush .\n\u201c Pretty bad given that he \u2019 s already battling the Bush fatigue and dynasty issue , \u201d said one New Hampshire Republican .\nAn uncommitted Iowa Republican added , \u201c This would not be a big deal if he had a different last name . But since his name is Bush , it \u2019 s another log on the \u2018 Bush Fatigue \u2019 fire . \u201d\nAnd a New Hampshire Republican aligned with a rival camp piled on : \u201c It reminds everyone that he has been , is , and will be in his brother \u2019 s shadow , which not only raises policy concerns but also the specter of dynasty . \u201d\nThe Iraq episode also raises questions about whether Jeb \u2019 s ready for primetime .\nMany insiders from both parties expressed disbelief that Bush wasn \u2019 t better-prepared to answer questions about the war in Iraq .\n\u201c Take away whether you agree or disagree with his answer , hypothetical or not , the fact that he is so incredibly unprepared for the spotlight is very alarming , \u201d said one Iowa Republican who supports another candidate . \u201c As I answer this survey , he has changed his position for a third time . Hello ! ? \u201d\nAn unaffiliated Granite State Republican noted that New Hampshire is not a particularly hawkish state , and that the unpopularity of the war in Iraq cost Republicans a lot of New Hampshire seats , in Congress and the statehouse , back in 2006 and 2008 .\n\u201c If there was one topic Jeb Bush needed to have a good answer on during this campaign , this was it , \u201d the insider said . \u201c More than anything , these answers from Jeb this week were a reminder for Republicans about what they disliked most about his brother . \u201d\nOn the other side of the aisle , a New Hampshire Democrat aligned with Clinton sniped , \u201c He has handled talking about Iraq about as well as his brother handled the actual war . Jeb Bush is the obvious frontrunner , and he is stumbling out of the gate . \u201d\nMost Republican insiders didn \u2019 t think Bush did himself any harm when he recently called his brother his top adviser on U.S.-Israel policy ( though Democrats overwhelmingly did ) . But he should keep the references to his brother to a minimum , they said , and the overwhelming answer to how the former president could be helpful was through fundraising , preferably behind closed doors .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a fool to use W for anything other than shaking money out of people , \u201d said one Iowa Republican aligned with another candidate .\nA New Hampshire Democrat noted gleefully , \u201c Is this even a question on the Republican side ? As a Democrat , I heartily endorse the idea of George W. Bush coming to \u2026 campaign frequently for Jeb ! \u201d\nBut several respondents did note that the former president could be a helpful voice , in private , as his brother seeks to court pro-Israel and evangelical voters .\n\u201c Those voters who support Israel know that President Bush was a staunch , unequivocating ally of the nation , \u201d said one unaligned New Hampshire Republican . \u201c That Gov . Bush is taking his cues from him is a welcome development especially since so many Jewish people believe that President Obama is capitulating to anti-Israeli interests . For example , dispatching him to smooth things over with Sheldon Adelson was a smart move . \u201d\nAs for Bill , many Democrats also want him to keep a low profile .\nMost insiders see Bill Clinton as an excellent speaker who can rally the base and energize crowds . But for now , he should avoid overshadowing the actual candidate by sticking largely to fundraisers and lower-key events , they say .\n\u201c He needs to let Hillary get out more first and set the tone of her campaign , talk about her messages and connect with voters , \u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c Once she establishes her campaign more widely , he should sweep in on the latter half and campaign for her . He is an asset \u2014 for sure \u2014 but people also want to hear about her and her ideas . \u201d\nRepublicans , and some Democrats , noted that Bill Clinton has caused some problems for the Clinton campaign in the way he \u2019 s handled questions about donations to their family foundation . Staying out of the limelight for now , some said , would help .\n\u201c He needs to be supportive and in the background , \u201d an Iowa Democrat said . \u201c So far his comments have not helped , especially when questioned about the Clinton Foundation . \u201d\nSeveral noted his ability , for better and worse , to go off-script .\n\u201c He is a huge asset to Secretary Clinton . But at the same time , his likeability comes from his brilliance and ability to speak provocatively and not without a little thrilling unpredictability , \u201d said one New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c How do you solve a problem like Bill Clinton ? He must be putting quite few gray hairs on Robby Mook \u2019 s little head , \u201d the insider continued , referring to Clinton \u2019 s 35-year-old campaign manager .\nAnother New Hampshire Democrat called for fewer speeches and more retail : \u201c Put a loose leash on the Big Dog , but someone definitely needs to be holding the leash . \u201d\nDemocrats are divided over whether Hillary needs to take a firmer position on trade .\nAbout half of Democrats think Clinton must say outright whether she supports the 12-nation Pacific trade deal and giving President Barack Obama fast-track authority . She \u2019 s given nuanced answers that nod to both sides ; the White House has insisted that Clinton is on their side , and some opponents of the deal have said that her silence shows she \u2019 s with them .\nAs the issue blew up on Capitol Hill this week , there \u2019 s increasing pressure from both sides for Clinton to give a yes-or-no answer .\n\u201c Just days ago I would have said that most voters , even most base voters , didn \u2019 t have [ this ] on their radar at all , \u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c Between media coverage , candidates scrambling to stake out policy positions , and even the President sending desperate-sounding emails to try to muster grassroots support , this issue is now on the front burner . \u201d\n\u201c Democrats haven \u2019 t forgotten that her husband , who has been referred to as \u2018 Outsourcer-in-Chief , \u2019 is held largely responsible for NAFTA and the negative impacts of those trade agreements , \u201d the Democrat added . \u201c That puts Hillary in a difficult place . \u201d\nClinton allies argue that it \u2019 s unfair to say she hasn \u2019 t taken a position ; it \u2019 s just that she \u2019 s very carefully threaded the needle . Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership recently in New Hampshire , for example , she said : \u201c Well , any trade deal has to produce jobs , and raise wages , and increase prosperity and protect our security . And we have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive . \u201d\n\u201c Nothing wrong with Hillary not cutting POTUS off at knees , while expressing deep reservations , \u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat .\n\u201c In Iowa , her base is probably divided on the issue , \u201d added an Iowa Democrat . \u201c Rural communities tend to support trade deals , while organized labor tends to oppose them . \u201d\nSeven in 10 Republicans said she can not get away with not giving a more definitive answer .\nBacking up Obama on trade would hurt Hillary ; the question is how badly .\nThere \u2019 s a sense among several leading Democratic activists in the early states that Clinton standing with Obama might encourage Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) to reconsider running .\n\u201c Base voters would not want her to align herself with Obama on such a conservative issue , \u201d said an Iowa Democrat . \u201c All trade bills have played into the hands of conservatives in the past , and this one won \u2019 t be any different . \u201d\n\u201c She would lose a lot of support among the base , \u201d said another Iowa Democrat who backs her . \u201c This would become a litmus test for many Democratic activists , particularly organized labor . She needs to oppose it . \u201d\n\u201c It would move a non-trivial amount of support to Bernie Sanders , \u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat .\nClinton boosters argue that the damage would be limited because these are people who wouldn \u2019 t back her anyway .\n\u201c Progressives in Iowa that have already been reluctant to support her would use this as a rallying cry , \u201d said an Iowa Democrat who backs her . \u201c I think it wouldn \u2019 t lose her support but would make the opposition louder . \u201d\n\u201c Anyone who would be pressing Hillary on this is likely already in the Sanders/O \u2019 Malley/anti-Hillary faction , and they feel very awkward because they were all primary supporters of President Obama over Hillary in 2008 , \u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat .\nOthers pointed out that the last three Democratic governors of New Hampshire were pretty openly pro-free trade . \u201c Labor doesn \u2019 t have a big footprint here , and the people who are ardently opposed to the president \u2019 s trade agenda are unlikely to be big Clinton supporters to begin with , \u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat .\nDespite the events of this week , the Republican base does not really care about the trade fight .\nThis is the first huge , public intra-party fight in a while for Democrats , but most Republican insiders said their base is not paying attention in the early states .\n\u201c C \u2019 mon , there isn \u2019 t one voter in 100 who knows enough about these trade deals to explain them to someone else , \u201d said one in New Hampshire .\n\u201c It still feels like a D.C./Beltway/K Street issue , \u201d said another .\n\u201c The isolationist , [ Pat ] Buchanan wing of the party is fervently dead-set against it , but they are far outnumbered by those who favor it or don \u2019 t care , \u201d added an Iowa Republican .\nAgricultural interests are big proponents of the measure , and Iowa exports over $ 15 billion a year . But an Iowa Republican noted that fights over trade seem abstract for many voters . \u201c Maslow \u2019 s hierarchy of needs is on the low end with so many security-based concerns , \u201d he said . \u201c Trade is more self-actualization to voters . \u201d\nPaul should seize the spotlight in the Patriot Act brawl .\nSen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) has pledged to filibuster the reauthorization of the Patriot Act as the Senate takes up the matter again \u2014 a good move for him , at least in the more libertarian Granite State , insiders say . Nearly three-quarters of both New Hampshire Republicans and Democrats say Paul \u2019 s plan would help in their state .\n\u201c This is New Hampshire . Live Free or Die ! Don \u2019 t tread on me , and leave my phone records alone , \u201d said one Granite State Democrat who said the filibuster would be an asset .\nAdded an unaligned New Hampshire Republican : \u201c It enhances his standing with a vocal minority in a field with 19 candidates . To win New Hampshire you only have to be able to count to 25 percent . \u201d\nRespondents from Iowa were more divided about whether the move would be useful : nearly as many Iowa Republicans said it would help as said a filibuster would hurt ( less than one in 10 New Hampshire Republicans said the same ) . On the other side of the aisle , nearly half of Iowa Democrats said it would help ; roughly one-tenth said it would hurt .\n\u201c He is supposed to already have the libertarian vote share his father got , \u201d said one Iowa Republican who aligns with another candidate . \u201c He needs to moderate his views on this so he can attract voters who are more worried about national security . \u201d\nThese are the members of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus ( not all of whom participated this week ) :\nIowa : Tim Albrecht , Brad Anderson , Rob Barron , Jeff Boeyink , Bonnie Campbell , Dave Caris , Sam Clovis , Sara Craig , Jerry Crawford , John Davis , Steve Deace , John Deeth , Derek Eadon , Ed Failor Jr. , Karen Fesler , David Fischer , Doug Gross , Steve Grubbs , Tim Hagle , Bob Haus , Joe Henry , Drew Ivers , Jill June , Lori Jungling , Jeff Kaufmann , Brian Kennedy , Jake Ketzner , David Kochel , Chris Larimer , Chuck Larson , Jill Latham , Jeff Link , Dave Loebsack , Mark Lucas , Liz Mathis , Jan Michelson , Chad Olsen , David Oman , Matt Paul , Marlys Popma , Troy Price , Christopher Rants , Kim Reem , Craig Robinson , Sam Roecker , David Roederer , Nick Ryan , Tamara Scott , Joni Scotter , Karen Slifka , John Smith , AJ Spiker , Norm Sterzenbach , John Stineman , Matt Strawn , Phil Valenziano , Jessica Vanden Berg , Nate Willems , Eric Woolson , Grant Young\nNew Hampshire : Charlie Arlinghaus , Arnie Arnesen , Patrick Arnold , Rich Ashooh , Dean Barker , Juliana Bergeron , D.J .

    "content_original": "Four in 10 Democratic insiders in the early states warn that Hillary Clinton is not spending enough time on the campaign trail, making her vulnerable to possible challenges from the left and dampening the enthusiasm of progressives who are already committed to her.\n\nThe POLITICO Caucus \u2014 our weekly bipartisan pulse-taking of the most important activists, operatives and elected officials in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 also finds Democrats almost evenly divided over whether Clinton needs to take a firmer position on the trade battle that\u2019s gripped Washington this week, but many approve of Bill Clinton\u2019s efforts to be a more silent partner in his wife\u2019s campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nClinton will return to Iowa and New Hampshire next week, amidst an aggressive fundraising swing. Her campaign said Thursday that the events will again be small and relatively private.\n\nBut insiders are clamoring for the former secretary of state to do more events that allow more voters to see her in person. There\u2019s a pervasive belief that her campaign stops need to feel more authentic and open in order to fire up the base.\n\n\u201cShe needs to step it up dramatically,\u201d said a pro-Clinton Iowa Democrat, who \u2014 like all 77 respondents \u2014 completed the questionnaire anonymously in order to speak candidly.\n\n\u201cWe have this need to feel well-loved every four years,\u201d said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat. \u201cIf other candidates begin to make inroads, Clinton\u2019s absence will be noted.\u201d\n\nSeveral Democrats said she should headline a rally or give a major speech soon. One key Democrat in Iowa, where she finished third in 2008, explained that \u201ca big open-attendance event would go a long way because it would at least let people actually see her\u201d in person.\n\nTo escape the media scrum, a New Hampshire Democrat suggested Clinton show up unannounced in the less populous North Country. \u201cDrop in on breakfast at a couple local spots, and then let word trickle out,\u201d the uncommitted activist said. \u201cShe can spend a few hours doing very normal, hassle-free retail campaigning and then hold some kind of press avail later in the day.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of Democrats joked that their friends will never be satisfied no matter how much time Hillary puts in on the ground. \u201cThere is more concern out there among Democrats than I would have thought,\u201d said one in New Hampshire. \u201cPeople feel freer to voice their concerns about the Big Crash that everyone thinks will happen to her campaign.\u201d\n\nSome establishment Democrats think there\u2019s little upside to mixing it up at this stage, and they believe that the press is obsessed only with asking gotcha questions. \u201cThe less time she can spend on the campaign trail, the better,\u201d said an uncommitted New Hampshire Democrat. \u201cEvents bring a lot of unwelcome attacks,\u201d said another. \u201cShe\u2019s on the money trail now,\u201d said a pro-Clinton Democrat in Iowa. \u201cThere is time in the fall to wear out her shoes.\u201d\n\nEven some who want her on the trail more note a massive influx of field staff over the past month. \u201cIn Des Moines, I always see three or four of them meeting for coffee at the Smokey Row coffee house,\u201d said a Democrat, referring to local hangout. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the O\u2019Malley guy hangs out there too!\u201d\n\nSeven in 10 Republicans said Clinton spends too little time campaigning. \u201cBut when she does, she is so horrible, dull, scripted and phony that the Hillary juggernaut should create plans to build a soundproof Rose Garden in Brooklyn,\u201d said a Granite Stater.\n\n\u201cJust about every other day I run into a Democrat who says, \u2018Jeez, your side is having all the fun,\u2019\u201d said an Iowan.\n\nOne-third of GOP insiders said she\u2019s smart to limit her appearances.\n\n\u201cShe has no credible opponents,\u201d said a New Hampshire Republican. \u201cShe could hibernate for the next 10 months and be totally absent from the campaign trail. And still be fine.\u201d\n\nHere are eight other takeaways from this 14th edition of The POLITICO Caucus:\n\nJeb\u2019s fumbling of questions about Iraq reminds insiders of Bush-name baggage.\n\nIt took until Thursday for Bush to clarify that, knowing now about intelligence failures in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, authorized by his brother, he would not have gone to war there. Earlier this week, he dismissed that question as a \u201chypothetical\u201d \u2014 a position that three-quarters of Republican insiders called problematic.\n\nSeveral insiders think the kerfuffle will make it harder for Bush to distance himself from his brother, former President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cPretty bad given that he\u2019s already battling the Bush fatigue and dynasty issue,\u201d said one New Hampshire Republican.\n\nAn uncommitted Iowa Republican added, \u201cThis would not be a big deal if he had a different last name. But since his name is Bush, it\u2019s another log on the \u2018Bush Fatigue\u2019 fire.\u201d\n\nAnd a New Hampshire Republican aligned with a rival camp piled on: \u201cIt reminds everyone that he has been, is, and will be in his brother\u2019s shadow, which not only raises policy concerns but also the specter of dynasty.\u201d\n\nThe Iraq episode also raises questions about whether Jeb\u2019s ready for primetime.\n\nMany insiders from both parties expressed disbelief that Bush wasn\u2019t better-prepared to answer questions about the war in Iraq.\n\n\u201cTake away whether you agree or disagree with his answer, hypothetical or not, the fact that he is so incredibly unprepared for the spotlight is very alarming,\u201d said one Iowa Republican who supports another candidate. \u201cAs I answer this survey, he has changed his position for a third time. Hello!?\u201d\n\nAn unaffiliated Granite State Republican noted that New Hampshire is not a particularly hawkish state, and that the unpopularity of the war in Iraq cost Republicans a lot of New Hampshire seats, in Congress and the statehouse, back in 2006 and 2008.\n\n\u201cIf there was one topic Jeb Bush needed to have a good answer on during this campaign, this was it,\u201d the insider said. \u201cMore than anything, these answers from Jeb this week were a reminder for Republicans about what they disliked most about his brother.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, a New Hampshire Democrat aligned with Clinton sniped, \u201cHe has handled talking about Iraq about as well as his brother handled the actual war. Jeb Bush is the obvious frontrunner, and he is stumbling out of the gate.\u201d\n\nUse W. only in doses, and generally with donors.\n\nMost Republican insiders didn\u2019t think Bush did himself any harm when he recently called his brother his top adviser on U.S.-Israel policy (though Democrats overwhelmingly did). But he should keep the references to his brother to a minimum, they said, and the overwhelming answer to how the former president could be helpful was through fundraising, preferably behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fool to use W for anything other than shaking money out of people,\u201d said one Iowa Republican aligned with another candidate.\n\nA New Hampshire Democrat noted gleefully, \u201cIs this even a question on the Republican side? As a Democrat, I heartily endorse the idea of George W. Bush coming to \u2026 campaign frequently for Jeb!\u201d\n\nBut several respondents did note that the former president could be a helpful voice, in private, as his brother seeks to court pro-Israel and evangelical voters.\n\n\u201cThose voters who support Israel know that President Bush was a staunch, unequivocating ally of the nation,\u201d said one unaligned New Hampshire Republican. \u201cThat Gov. Bush is taking his cues from him is a welcome development especially since so many Jewish people believe that President Obama is capitulating to anti-Israeli interests. For example, dispatching him to smooth things over with Sheldon Adelson was a smart move.\u201d\n\nAs for Bill, many Democrats also want him to keep a low profile.\n\nMost insiders see Bill Clinton as an excellent speaker who can rally the base and energize crowds. But for now, he should avoid overshadowing the actual candidate by sticking largely to fundraisers and lower-key events, they say.\n\n\u201cHe needs to let Hillary get out more first and set the tone of her campaign, talk about her messages and connect with voters,\u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat. \u201cOnce she establishes her campaign more widely, he should sweep in on the latter half and campaign for her. He is an asset \u2014 for sure \u2014 but people also want to hear about her and her ideas.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, and some Democrats, noted that Bill Clinton has caused some problems for the Clinton campaign in the way he\u2019s handled questions about donations to their family foundation. Staying out of the limelight for now, some said, would help.\n\n\u201cHe needs to be supportive and in the background,\u201d an Iowa Democrat said. \u201cSo far his comments have not helped, especially when questioned about the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nSeveral noted his ability, for better and worse, to go off-script.\n\n\u201cHe is a huge asset to Secretary Clinton. But at the same time, his likeability comes from his brilliance and ability to speak provocatively and not without a little thrilling unpredictability,\u201d said one New Hampshire Democrat. \u201cHow do you solve a problem like Bill Clinton? He must be putting quite few gray hairs on Robby Mook\u2019s little head,\u201d the insider continued, referring to Clinton\u2019s 35-year-old campaign manager.\n\nAnother New Hampshire Democrat called for fewer speeches and more retail: \u201cPut a loose leash on the Big Dog, but someone definitely needs to be holding the leash.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are divided over whether Hillary needs to take a firmer position on trade.\n\nAbout half of Democrats think Clinton must say outright whether she supports the 12-nation Pacific trade deal and giving President Barack Obama fast-track authority. She\u2019s given nuanced answers that nod to both sides; the White House has insisted that Clinton is on their side, and some opponents of the deal have said that her silence shows she\u2019s with them.\n\nAs the issue blew up on Capitol Hill this week, there\u2019s increasing pressure from both sides for Clinton to give a yes-or-no answer.\n\n\u201cJust days ago I would have said that most voters, even most base voters, didn\u2019t have [this] on their radar at all,\u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat. \u201cBetween media coverage, candidates scrambling to stake out policy positions, and even the President sending desperate-sounding emails to try to muster grassroots support, this issue is now on the front burner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats haven\u2019t forgotten that her husband, who has been referred to as \u2018Outsourcer-in-Chief,\u2019 is held largely responsible for NAFTA and the negative impacts of those trade agreements,\u201d the Democrat added. \u201cThat puts Hillary in a difficult place.\u201d\n\nClinton allies argue that it\u2019s unfair to say she hasn\u2019t taken a position; it\u2019s just that she\u2019s very carefully threaded the needle. Asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership recently in New Hampshire, for example, she said: \u201cWell, any trade deal has to produce jobs, and raise wages, and increase prosperity and protect our security. And we have to do our part in making sure we have the capabilities and the skills to be competitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing wrong with Hillary not cutting POTUS off at knees, while expressing deep reservations,\u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\n\u201cIn Iowa, her base is probably divided on the issue,\u201d added an Iowa Democrat. \u201cRural communities tend to support trade deals, while organized labor tends to oppose them.\u201d\n\nSeven in 10 Republicans said she cannot get away with not giving a more definitive answer.\n\nBacking up Obama on trade would hurt Hillary; the question is how badly.\n\nThere\u2019s a sense among several leading Democratic activists in the early states that Clinton standing with Obama might encourage Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to reconsider running.\n\n\u201cBase voters would not want her to align herself with Obama on such a conservative issue,\u201d said an Iowa Democrat. \u201cAll trade bills have played into the hands of conservatives in the past, and this one won\u2019t be any different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would lose a lot of support among the base,\u201d said another Iowa Democrat who backs her. \u201cThis would become a litmus test for many Democratic activists, particularly organized labor. She needs to oppose it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would move a non-trivial amount of support to Bernie Sanders,\u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nClinton boosters argue that the damage would be limited because these are people who wouldn\u2019t back her anyway.\n\n\u201cProgressives in Iowa that have already been reluctant to support her would use this as a rallying cry,\u201d said an Iowa Democrat who backs her. \u201cI think it wouldn\u2019t lose her support but would make the opposition louder.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone who would be pressing Hillary on this is likely already in the Sanders/O\u2019Malley/anti-Hillary faction, and they feel very awkward because they were all primary supporters of President Obama over Hillary in 2008,\u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nOthers pointed out that the last three Democratic governors of New Hampshire were pretty openly pro-free trade. \u201cLabor doesn\u2019t have a big footprint here, and the people who are ardently opposed to the president\u2019s trade agenda are unlikely to be big Clinton supporters to begin with,\u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nDespite the events of this week, the Republican base does not really care about the trade fight.\n\nThis is the first huge, public intra-party fight in a while for Democrats, but most Republican insiders said their base is not paying attention in the early states.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, there isn\u2019t one voter in 100 who knows enough about these trade deals to explain them to someone else,\u201d said one in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIt still feels like a D.C./Beltway/K Street issue,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cThe isolationist, [Pat] Buchanan wing of the party is fervently dead-set against it, but they are far outnumbered by those who favor it or don\u2019t care,\u201d added an Iowa Republican.\n\nAgricultural interests are big proponents of the measure, and Iowa exports over $15 billion a year. But an Iowa Republican noted that fights over trade seem abstract for many voters. \u201cMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is on the low end with so many security-based concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cTrade is more self-actualization to voters.\u201d\n\nPaul should seize the spotlight in the Patriot Act brawl.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has pledged to filibuster the reauthorization of the Patriot Act as the Senate takes up the matter again \u2014 a good move for him, at least in the more libertarian Granite State, insiders say. Nearly three-quarters of both New Hampshire Republicans and Democrats say Paul\u2019s plan would help in their state.\n\n\u201cThis is New Hampshire. Live Free or Die! Don\u2019t tread on me, and leave my phone records alone,\u201d said one Granite State Democrat who said the filibuster would be an asset.\n\nAdded an unaligned New Hampshire Republican: \u201cIt enhances his standing with a vocal minority in a field with 19 candidates. To win New Hampshire you only have to be able to count to 25 percent.\u201d\n\nRespondents from Iowa were more divided about whether the move would be useful: nearly as many Iowa Republicans said it would help as said a filibuster would hurt (less than one in 10 New Hampshire Republicans said the same). On the other side of the aisle, nearly half of Iowa Democrats said it would help; roughly one-tenth said it would hurt.\n\n\u201cHe is supposed to already have the libertarian vote share his father got,\u201d said one Iowa Republican who aligns with another candidate. \u201cHe needs to moderate his views on this so he can attract voters who are more worried about national security.\u201d\n\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus (not all of whom participated this week):\n\nIowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\n\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.
