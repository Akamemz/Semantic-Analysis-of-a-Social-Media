    "content": "So we finally have actual election results from the state of New Hampshire . They are clear , and they are authoritative and they are a little bit complicated . \u201c Hello , America. \u201d \u201c We are here to stay. \u201d \u201c Our campaign is built for the long haul. \u201d \u201c We \u2019 re going to Nevada . We \u2019 re going to South Carolina . We \u2019 re going to win those states as well. \u201d Bernie Sanders has won the state by a little bit . Two other candidates who had quite a strong night \u2014 Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar . Not such a good night for Joe Biden or for Elizabeth Warren or for anybody else . \u201c New Hampshire. \u201d \u201c New Hampshire. \u201d \u201c New Hampshire. \u201d \u201c We \u2019 re here together. \u201d \u201c New Hampshire. \u201d \u201c You all up here in New Hampshire. \u201d After the debacle in Iowa , national attention has focused even more intensely on New Hampshire as the first real clean test of political momentum in this race . \u201c People are still undecided. \u201d \u201c Uh , Bernie. \u201d \u201c Bernie Sanders , all the way. \u201d \u201c Mayor Pete. \u201d \u201c Amy Klobuchar. \u201d \u201c Oh , Joe Biden. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 ll just probably decide Tuesday , five minutes before I go in to vote. \u201d New Hampshire is a classic swing state . \u201c Ronald Reagan is the winner in the state of New Hampshire. \u201d \u201c Bill Clinton won it. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s neck and neck. \u201d \u201c New Hampshire goes to Obama. \u201d In 2016 , Hillary Clinton prevailed over Donald Trump , but by a tiny margin . It \u2019 s a state that \u2019 s very much in play for 2020 . \u201c Four more , Trump . Four more years ! \u201d New Hampshire might gauge whether a candidate is able to appeal to certain other constituencies they will need in the general election . We have seen over the last week a real rivalry emerge between Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg . \u201c Hot , fresh and vegan . Get your Bernie-on-a-stick. \u201d New Hampshire is really home turf for Bernie Sanders . He comes from right next door in Vermont . And he also drew strong support , as he did in 2016 , from younger voters and more liberal voters . \u201c Young voters want Bernie because he \u2019 s fighting for their future . He \u2019 s not fighting for his future . He \u2019 s in his future. \u201d [ cheering ] Bernie Sanders came into New Hampshire claiming momentum out of Iowa , based on his lead in the popular vote . \u201c Finally , the votes were counted in Iowa . Took them a little while . We won the vote by 6,000 votes. \u201d He has been somewhat more aggressive with his primary opponents here \u2026 \u201c We don \u2019 t have a Super PAC. \u201d \u2026 talking about the difference between himself \u2026 \u201c We don \u2019 t want billionaires \u2019 money. \u201d \u2026 and candidates in the race , like Pete Buttigieg , who take money from billionaires and other big donors . \u201c We are running a campaign for working people , funded by working people . And that is why we are going to win here in New Hampshire and all over this country. \u201d [ cheering ] The biggest thing this might mean for Bernie Sanders is that he has clearly reasserted himself as the dominant leader on the left wing of the Democratic Party . And then there \u2019 s Pete Buttigieg . \u201c Back in the Obama campaign , we called it \u2018 no drama Obama , \u2019 and I haven \u2019 t come up with the right rhyme for Buttigieg. \u201d [ cheering ] Pete Buttigieg has claimed , among the moderate candidates , a sense of momentum in New Hampshire that other folks were not able to take . \u201c We can \u2019 t risk dividing Americans further . The idea that you \u2019 ve either got to be for a revolution or you got to be for the status quo leaves most of us out. \u201d His message here has been pretty similar to his message in Iowa , but really focused on the idea that he \u2019 s the candidate who can win crossover support in the general election . \u201c We need a politics that brings all of us in because all of us need a new and better president. \u201d After finishing at the top in both Iowa and New Hampshire , Buttigieg now has a tremendous opportunity to put himself forward at the national level as the leader of moderate Democrats . Announcer : \u201c Senator Amy Klobuchar ! \u201d The word that Amy Klobuchar supporters are using to describe what happened here is \u2018 Klomentum. \u2019 She came to New Hampshire after a fifth-place finish in Iowa without a whole lot of wind in her sails . \u201c It \u2019 s been funny suddenly seeing media come to all of our events. \u201d [ laughter ] Things just turned around for her dramatically . If Klobuchar had not finished so strong in New Hampshire , it might have been the end of her campaign . \u201c If you are tired of the extremes in our politics , and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense , you have a home with me. \u201d She gets the chance to fight onward to Nevada and South Carolina and Super Tuesday .
