(Reuters) - Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign had built up what it described as the largest California operation of any Democratic presidential candidate - until billionaire Mike Bloomberg made a late entry into the race in November with seemingly bottomless resources.\n\nA man holds a sign criticizing billionaires in the presidential race during a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg at the Dollarhide Community Center in Compton, California, U.S. February 3, 2020. REUTERS/Andrew Cullen\n\nWithin two months, the former New York City mayor hired 200 employees in California, according to his campaign, dwarfing Sanders\u2019 80-strong team in the state while spending more on television ads nationally than all 10 other Democratic candidates combined.\n\nGet the latest from the Iowa caucuses: here\n\nBloomberg\u2019s unprecedented blitzkrieg \u2013 spending over a quarter-billion dollars nationwide on advertising alone since November \u2013 could upend the competition for California and the other 13 states that vote on March 3, otherwise known as Super Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, as his rivals barnstorm across Iowa ahead of the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses that evening, Bloomberg will be nearly 1,900 miles (3,060 km) away campaigning in California, the single biggest prize of the presidential primary with 10 times as many delegates available as in Iowa.\n\nThe contrast highlights both risks and opportunities of his unorthodox strategy: Bloomberg is skipping Iowa and three other states that vote in February and traditionally help anoint front-runners, instead employing his massive fortune to overwhelm opponents in much larger, delegate-rich states that will start voting from March.\n\nIt\u2019s a path that has been tried unsuccessfully by others in the past, notably another former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani.

Warren, who appears to have the next biggest presence, has more than two dozen paid staffers in the state.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s spending spree has also inflated the cost of television ads in Texas, potentially making it even harder for other candidates to keep up, an aide for a rival campaign said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe other candidates\u2019 Super Tuesday operations will soon get an influx of staffers, as organizers depart states like Iowa to bolster efforts elsewhere.\n\nIn a recent memo to supporters, Warren\u2019s campaign manager, Roger Lau, said the campaign has more than 1,000 staff members and more than 100 field offices in 31 states.
