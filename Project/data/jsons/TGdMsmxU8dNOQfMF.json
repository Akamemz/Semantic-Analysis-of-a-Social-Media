    "content": "Speaker John Boehner 's September announcement about leaving Congress was a shock to lawmakers who had been deep in painstaking negotiations for months on a bill to replace No Child Left Behind , which President Barack Obama signed into law this week . Getting a new federal education law was hard enough , given the many warring constituencies involved . With the exit of the speaker \u2014 a key supporter \u2014 lawmakers ' plans were again jeopardized .\nThe new speaker wanted to bring more old-fashioned legislating to the House . So Sen. Lamar Alexander , an old-fashioned lawmaker , sat next to Ryan during a visit to the senators ' weekly Tuesday lunch , just days after Ryan was sworn in . He pitched him on the bill , which would replace the central federal law governing public schools .\n\u201c I said , \u2018 We \u2019 ve got a bill for you , \u2019 \u201d said Alexander , chairman of the Senate education committee . \u201c Here \u2019 s an opportunity for you to do something big and bipartisan and successful \u2014 and do it in regular order . \u201d\nRep. John Kline , education chairman in the House , also spoke with Ryan about the merits of the bill \u2014 which had drawn major opposition from the same conservatives who had pushed Boehner to resign . Weeks earlier , friends Ryan and Kline had each been trying to edge the other toward taking the speaker \u2019 s gavel . Now , Ryan agreed to support Kline \u2019 s bill . They \u2019 d bring it to the House floor for a vote soon , when Ryan was still new to the speakership and the bill could arguably pass off as part of Boehner \u2019 s legacy , according to Alexander .\nThe No Child Left Behind bill , momentarily lost in the scramble , was charging forward again .\nThe uncertainty in Alexander \u2019 s parlance had looked like yet another alligator that was \u201c lurking at every corner \u201d for the education bill over the course of 2015 . There were many : opposition from House conservatives that led leadership to pull an earlier version of the bill from the House floor ; union-backed calls for less testing that could have killed support from the Obama administration ; a three-hour break from Senate debate to settle a dispute between Sen. Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) and Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) over school funding that could have sunk a Senate vote on the bill . At the same time , constituents and teachers unions were increasingly frustrated with the state of federal education policy , as evidenced by massive protests against testing and the Common Core across the country .\nBut in the end , Boehner \u2019 s retirement was ironically a blessing for the four lawmakers who had confidently guided their bill forward through marathon markups , a months-long effort to woo skeptical House conservatives and even chatting up the president on Air Force One . Now , they had a route back through the House with Ryan \u2019 s support , to the Senate and onto Obama \u2019 s desk . The time frame was tight , but it would keep them from running into any issues with the 2016 elections making it difficult or toxic to legislate on education .\nThere was only one issue . The bill wasn \u2019 t finished yet .\nThis year \u2019 s work to rewrite No Child Left Behind , the country \u2019 s overarching education law , started the day after the 2014 midterm elections . Alexander , fresh off a successful reelection bid and expected chairman of the Senate HELP Committee with Republicans now in control , gathered aides to tell them his top priority would be replacing the dated education law .\nNo Child Left Behind , first passed in 2002 , was an ambitious , bipartisan attempt to close achievement gaps between poor and minority students and their peers by setting a goal for all students to eventually become proficient in reading and math . But the law prescribed tests to measure students achievement , and sanctions for schools who weren \u2019 t yielding improvement . The end result : The law became widely unpopular and was blamed \u2013 many argue , incorrectly \u2013 for an explosion of testing in the states in recent years . An Obama administration attempt to remedy the situation by offering states waivers from parts of the law only spurred more acrimony , because the waivers also pushed the Obama education agenda . The waivers also killed the momentum of earlier attempts to rewrite No Child Left Behind , dragging the law seven years past its expiration date .\nRewriting a widely unpopular law may seem like a no-brainer for an incoming education chairman . But the divisive politics around education policy had made it extremely difficult to do . Multiple attempts to rewrite the law since its 2007 expiration had fallen flat . Before last year \u2019 s midterms , an overwhelming majority of education experts polled by the consulting firm Whiteboard Advisors said replacing No Child Left Behind would have to wait until well after the 2016 elections \u2014 if it ever happened at all .\nEven Education Secretary Arne Duncan , who called on Congress repeatedly for a new law , suggested that Alexander try working on higher education policy first , according to a GOP aide .\nBut constituents in Tennessee and elsewhere had long been crying out for changes to No Child Left Behind . And Alexander , a former U.S. education secretary for President George H.W . Bush and the son of a teacher , plowed forward .\nHe started his chairmanship by dropping a draft bill that , to the chagrin of Democrats , was stacked with Republican priorities . Sen. Patty Murray , new as the top Democrat on HELP , sold Alexander on the idea that the two should work together on a bipartisan bill that could move through the chamber with the support of both parties . Back in 2001 , Republicans had lined up behind President George W. Bush in support of No Child Left Behind and its dramatic increase to the federal role in education . But Alexander now wanted to scale back the federal role , trim the education secretary power and potentially give states block granted federal funds that could be converted into school vouchers . These proposals would have ostracized Democrats , including Obama .\nNot only was the conversation the start of months of bipartisan work between the two senators , it also set the tone for what lawmakers in both chambers say were upfront , collaborative relationships that were crucial in nabbing them a victory . Lawmakers joined Alexander for breakfast in the Senate Dining Room ; aides bonded over pizza late at night .\nBoth sides played the long game , positioning themselves for an eventual conference and a bill that Obama could sign . During a January trip to Tennessee on Air Force One for the announcement of a community college initiative , for example , Alexander explained his plan to the president , and made a request : He didn \u2019 t want the president to threaten to veto the bill he was negotiating with Murray . The president agreed , Alexander said . Six months later , when a bill came to the Senate floor that was in conflict with the administration \u2019 s priorities , the White House stopped short of a veto threat .\nIn February , House Republicans moved forward with a conservative bill that had cleared the chamber in 2013 . At the time , Kline saw it as a speedy way to pass an initial bill and position himself with a strongly conservative proposal as a starting point for conference . But the bill was scheduled for a vote the same week as a debate over Department of Homeland Security funding erupted , and anger from the far right against House leadership was running high . In the hours leading up to the scheduled vote , it was clear it wasn \u2019 t going to pass . Critics said the bill didn \u2019 t do nearly enough to roll back the federal role in education , anti-Common Core bloggers had spread misinformation about the bill in the states and the conservative groups Heritage Action and Club for Growth launched an assault against it .\n\u201c I thought we could get to the solution better , quicker , cleaner \u201d by using a bill that had passed the House before , Kline said . \u201c I made a mistake . \u201d\nKline and other House Republican supporters including Rep. Todd Rokita ( R-Ind . ) worked for months to win support they needed from their colleagues to bring the bill back up for a vote , discussing the bill in meetings and one-on-one to skeptics . Months later , in July , it just barely passed the chamber .\nOn the other side of the aisle , Rep. Bobby Scott , the education committee \u2019 s top Democrat , was wrestling with the his party \u2019 s divide between unions and education reformers , and preparing for the point when House Republicans would need his support to keep the ball moving forward .\nScott and Murray , like most Democrats , have good relationships with the teachers unions . But in this year \u2019 s negotiations , labor was more closely aligned with Republicans on some of the most contentious points of the bill : how often to test students , what constraints to put on opting out of exams and how states should rate schools .\nScott , Murray and the White House all wanted to preserve testing students each year , break out data on test results to show achievement gaps and use that information to determine when a school needs to change \u2014 as a clear way to ensure poor and minority students don \u2019 t fall through the cracks in the system . And they wanted requirements that low-performing schools work to change . This was civil rights advocates \u2019 point of view , and they worked closely with the White House and business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce to advance it .\nBut teachers unions , who spend tens of millions of dollars each cycle backing candidates , saw the system differently : No Child Left Behind created a \u201c test-and-punish \u201d environment where students are drilled on subjects , and the resources schools are given aren \u2019 t taken into account . They think students would benefit from more flexibility for teachers and less testing .\nAcross the country , the \u201c opt-out \u201d movement , strongly supported by unions , encouraged students to skip standardized tests tied to the Common Core . In New York state , 20 percent of students skipped tests last spring . And lawmakers , particularly in the House , heard the complaints from students , parents and teachers loud and clear . They introduced multiple , union-backed bills that would cut the number of federally mandated tests or secure students \u2019 right to opt out of testing without any consequences for schools .\nThis posed a particular challenge for Scott and his allies . To deflect critics Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici put forward a bill that would encourage states to identify redundant tests and delete them \u2014 a productive way to deflect unions \u2019 demands for getting rid of annual testing all-together .\nThe Bonamici proposal was inserted into the broader bill and became \u201c a trump card that we played almost daily \u201d during conversations with Democrats this year , Scott said .\nBy August , the House and Senate had each passed their NCLB bills . In the Senate , Alexander and Murray had hammered out an agreement that eventually passed with strong support from both parties .\nThe White House had held back on threatening to veto the Senate \u2019 s bill . But negotiating a bill that met halfway between the two wasn \u2019 t going to work : Scott and the White House wanted a bill that featured key aspects , further to the left in some ways than either the House or Senate versions .\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan \u201c still didn \u2019 t know \u201d at that point whether the lawmakers would emerge with a decent bill , Duncan told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c If they came back with a mediocre version of the House bill , or a mediocre version of the Senate bill , I would have recommended [ Obama ] not sign it . \u201d\nAnd so , after months of watching House Republicans wrestle with moving their bill through the House , Scott \u2014 who had views similar to the White House , and could deliver Democrats \u2019 votes \u2014 finally \u201c had a seat at the table , \u201d he said .\nAides began bridging gaps between the two bills in August . By September , they had made headway on large chunks but despite extensive discussion couldn \u2019 t compromise on the most politically divisive section of No Child Left Behind : how to evaluate schools and handle them when they do poorly .\nScott was eager to find a solution that didn \u2019 t sacrifice civil rights principles and satisfied Republicans \u2019 hankering for a return to local control .\nIn October , he pitched a plan to Kline : The federal government could mandate specific circumstances in which states and districts would have to intervene in a school \u2014 for example , in high school \u201c dropout factories \u201d where few students graduate . But it could give states significant leeway in both rating schools \u2019 performance and deciding how to help struggling schools .\nAfter some questions and changes , Kline \u2019 s office agreed and , soon after , so did the Senate .\nNot long after Ryan became speaker , in mid-November , and with little time left to wrap negotiations before lawmakers hoped to bring a bill up in the House , the four key lawmakers dialed in for a conference call .\nIt was the kind of day , Murray said , that the emerging deal on the education bill \u201c was either going to fall apart , or not . \u201d\nThey were optimistic .
