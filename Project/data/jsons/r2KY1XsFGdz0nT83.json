    "content": "Bernie Sanders has the money and momentum to keep his campaign going all the way through to the Democratic convention . But if he \u2019 s going to do it as anything other than an also-ran to Hillary Clinton , the Vermont Senator needs wins in contests like the ones coming Saturday .\nWashington state , Alaska and Hawaii all hold Democratic nomination contests on Saturday , and Sanders has a fighting chance for a sweep . All three states are holding caucuses , an activist-heavy format that Sanders has thrived on . Washington state and Alaska are also heavy on white Democrats , a core Sanders constituency , and have relatively few African Americans . Hawaii is a wild card , given a lack of polling and campaign attention , but Clinton surrogates are already working to deflate expectations .\nThe opportunity comes packaged with peril , however . In a race to 2,383 delegates , Clinton leads Sanders 1,690 to 946 . ( Even if Superdelegates are discounted , she \u2019 s still ahead by 303 pledged delegates . ) And after getting clobbered in the Midwest and beaten in Arizona , Sanders is in danger of sliding back into irrelevance if he can \u2019 t score wins in the states that lean in his favor .\nWin or lose , Clinton or Sanders will sit with Saturday \u2019 s consequences for a while . Other than April 5 \u2019 s tilt in Wisconsin , the race goes into semi-hibernation , without a major contest coming before New York \u2019 s 291-delegate scrap April 19 .\nDemocrats in three states on Saturday dole out 142 delegates Saturday . Here \u2019 s are the risks , rewards and likely outcomes in Washington , Alaska and Hawaii .\nOnly four states are left on the Democratic primary calendar with more delegates at stake than Washington , but right now neither candidate can claim to be the favorite to grab them .\n`` We 're kind of in a sweet spot in the calendar . I mean after us New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania and California are the four biggest , '' Washington state Democratic Party chairman Jaxon Ravens said . `` A couple weeks before us and a couple weeks after us there 's an empty space .

So I could be wrong but it just feels like there's more enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign hasn\u2019t left the state totally off its radar though.On Friday the campaign released a robocall by former President Bill Clinton across the state encouraging Democrats to vote.",
