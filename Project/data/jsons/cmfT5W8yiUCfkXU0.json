    "content": "President Trump just officially declared Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel , upending decades of US diplomacy and threatening to spark massive unrest across the Muslim world .\nSpeaking in the White House \u2019 s Diplomatic Reception Room , Trump also announced his plan to eventually relocate the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and begin the difficult logistical work of building a new diplomatic facility in the contested city .\n\u201c Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like any other sovereign nation to determine its own capital , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Acknowledging this is a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace . \u201d\nTrump described Jerusalem as the capital that \u201c the Jewish people established in ancient times , \u201d a line that may anger those in the Arab world who minimize , or deny , that Jews have had a historic connection to the city for millennia .\nStill , Trump \u2019 s speech was decidedly less inflammatory than it could have been . The president said the US \u201c would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides \u201d \u2014 at least nominally maintaining Washington \u2019 s commitment to a cornerstone of US foreign policy for decades \u2014 and called on both sides to maintain the existing status quo in the city .\nAlthough Trump declared Jerusalem to be Israel \u2019 s capital , he explicitly didn \u2019 t call it the undivided capital of Israel , leaving the door open for Israelis and Palestinians to divide the city during any final status negotiations between the two sides . In advance of the speech , White House officials repeatedly stressed that Trump \u2019 s announcement doesn \u2019 t represent a change in US policy on the future borders of Jerusalem .\nHere \u2019 s why that linguistic choice is so important . Both the Palestinians and the Israelis claim Jerusalem as their capital , and the city contains sites sacred to both Jews and Muslims . Though Israel \u2019 s Parliament and the prime minister \u2019 s home are in Jerusalem , they sit in West Jerusalem , on the side of the city Israel has controlled since 1949 . Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and annexed that half of the city .\nThe international community considers East Jerusalem occupied territory . But that half of the city also contains sites holy to all three major monotheistic religions , including the Western Wall , the holiest place in the world where Jews can openly pray , and Haram al-Sharif , Arabic for \u201c the Noble Sanctuary , \u201d a sacred site for Muslims that Israelis refer to as the Temple Mount .\nThe Palestinians want to officially divide the city and make East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state . The Israelis , to put it mildly , disagree \u2014 and the right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long made clear that it wouldn \u2019 t even consider making concessions over Jerusalem .\nThe decades-long political fight over the future of the city is what makes Trump \u2019 s new move so momentous \u2014 and so dangerous .\nWorld leaders from France to Saudi Arabia to China had cautioned Trump against the decision . Pope Francis even weighed in , calling on world leaders to let \u201c wisdom and prudence prevail \u201d so as \u201c to avoid adding new elements of tension. \u201d The US Consulate in Jerusalem issued a security warning barring all US government employees and their families from traveling to Jerusalem \u2019 s Old City or the West Bank ahead of the announcement because \u201c widespread demonstrations \u201d were expected .\nBut even though Trump \u2019 s speech ultimately didn \u2019 t go quite as far as many had expected , it may be too late to change perceptions that the Trump administration has unequivocally aligned itself with Israel . In other words , the damage may already be done .\nTrump is touching the third rail of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nThe status of Jerusalem has been a source of both division and contention for decades . During most of the 1990s \u2014 including during the creation of the Oslo peace accords between the Israelis and the Palestinians \u2014 negotiations over the final status of the city were left for the future to avoid derailing the rest of the talks .\nIn 2000 , negotiations between then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reportedly came close to dividing the city between the two peoples . The Israelis would have retained control over the Western Wall , and the Palestinians would have been given control of Haram al-Sharif , the third-holiest site in Islam .\nFinal negotiations reportedly broke down over questions of who would control a maze of underground tunnels that run beneath Jerusalem \u2019 s Old City .\nThere have been no recent negotiations over the city for a simple and grim reason : Despite the official US government line , Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been largely on hold for years , with no indications that they \u2019 ll resume anytime soon .\nIn the meantime , Jerusalem has retained the uniquely strange status of a city without a country .
