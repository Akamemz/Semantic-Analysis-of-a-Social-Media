Carson runs on that resume \u2014 an outsider who can pull together smart people to solve difficult problems . He rose in politics after criticizing President Obama 's policies in a 2013 speech , with Obama two seats away . Carson 's soft-spoken manner and Christian faith won him the admiration of many evangelicals . He rose as a prime challenger to Donald Trump in the fall and fell back when his lack of foreign policy experience became a vulnerability .

John Kasich can be brusque with voters and reporters , but he 's very popular at home . He has overseen Ohio 's economic recovery , pledging to bring job growth nationwide with reduced regulations and taxes . Kasich was the House budget chair in the mid-1990s and talks of balancing the federal budget with Bill Clinton . An establishment Republican , he has aggressively criticized Donald Trump . Kasich frequently notes that no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio , a place where he has always won .
