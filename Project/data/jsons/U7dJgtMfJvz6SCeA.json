    "content": "Hillary Clinton has earned enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination , according to an Associated Press count released Monday night \u2013 an assessment swiftly challenged by primary rival Bernie Sanders and his campaign .\nThe AP released its updated tally , showing the former secretary of state winning enough delegates to become the first woman to top a major party \u2019 s presidential ticket , on the eve of the last major day of primary voting .\nThe AP said Clinton reached the 2,383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee with a weekend victory in Puerto Rico and late burst of support from superdelegates . Those are party officials and officeholders , many of them eager to wrap up the primary , free to support whichever candidate they want .\n`` We really need to bring a close to this primary process and get on to defeating Donald Trump , '' said Nancy Worley , a superdelegate who chairs Alabama 's Democratic Party and provided one of the last endorsements to put Clinton over the top .\n`` It 's time to stand behind our presumptive candidate , '' said Michael Brown , one of two superdelegates from the District of Columbia who came forward in the past week to back Clinton before the city 's June 14 primary . `` We should n't be acting like we are undecided when the people of America have spoken . ''\nClinton touted the news at a Long Beach , Calif. , campaign event , saying the campaign is now on the \u201c brink of a historic \u2026 unprecedented moment. \u201d But even she stressed that six states are yet to vote on Tuesday and urged supporters to cast their ballots for her in those contests .\nThe six states to vote Tuesday include New Jersey , North Dakota , New Mexico , Montana , California , and South Dakota .\nCampaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement : \u201c This is an important milestone , but there are six states that are voting Tuesday , with millions of people heading to the polls , and Hillary Clinton is working to earn every vote . We look forward to Tuesday night , when Hillary Clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote , but also the majority of pledged delegates . ''\nThe Sanders campaign rejected the declaration that Clinton had clinched the party nod , citing its longstanding position that the superdelegates should not count until they actually vote at the convention \u2013 as they are free to switch sides before then .\n`` There is nothing to concede , '' Sanders told KTVU late Monday at a rally in San Francisco . `` Secretary Clinton will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to win the Democratic nomination . She will be dependent on superdelegates . They vote on July 25th so right now our goal right at this moment [ is to ] do everything we can to win the primary tomorrow . ''\nSanders spokesman Michael Briggs accused the media of \u201c a rush to judgement '' and `` ignoring the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer . ''\n`` Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump , '' Briggs said .\nOn Monday , Sanders ' supporters expressed disappointment that the calls were made before California 's primary and urged the senator to continue on despite the pronouncements . `` We 're going to keep fighting until the last vote is counted , '' said Kristen Elliott , a Sanders ' supporter from San Francisco who attended the rally .\nSaid another attendee , Patrick Bryant of San Francisco : `` It 's what bookies do . They call fights before they 're over . ''\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed Clinton during an interview on \u201c Good Morning America \u201d before her home state \u2019 s primary .\n`` I 'm a voter in California and I have voted for Hillary Clinton for president of the United States and proud to endorse her for that position , '' Pelosi said , though adding `` it 's not over until it 's over . ''\nClinton has won 1,812 pledged delegates in primaries and caucuses . She also has the support of 571 superdelegates , according to an Associated Press count . The AP surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months , and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted .\nAll the superdelegates counted in Clinton 's tally have unequivocally told the AP they will back her at the convention and not change their vote . Since the start of the AP 's survey in late 2015 , no superdelegates have switched from supporting Clinton to backing Sanders .\nClinton \u2019 s presumptive victory Monday came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first White House campaign to Barack Obama . Back then , she famously noted her inability to `` shatter that highest , hardest glass ceiling . ''\nCampaigning this time as the loyal successor to Obama , Clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from Vermont Sen. Sanders . He mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics-as-usual , even among Democrats who have controlled the White House since 2009 .\nClinton outpaced Sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in May . Following the results in Puerto Rico , it is no longer possible for Sanders to reach the 2,383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates , according to the AP .\nClinton leads Sanders by more than 3 million cast votes , by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates . She also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories .\nEchoing the sentiments of California Gov . Jerry Brown , who overcame a decades-long rivalry with the Clinton family to endorse her last week , many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could defeat Trump in November .\nBeyond winning over millions of Sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the self-described democratic socialist , Clinton faces challenges as she turns toward November , including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her New York home while serving as secretary of state . Her deep unpopularity among Republicans has pushed many leery of Trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign .\n`` This to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive , liberal term , which is what a Clinton presidency would do , '' House Speaker Paul Ryan told the AP last week after he finally endorsed Trump , weeks after the New Yorker clinched the GOP nomination .\nYet Clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone , leaving Sanders behind and focusing on lacerating Trump . She said electing the billionaire businessman , who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks , would be a `` historic mistake . ''\n`` He is not just unprepared . He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge , stability and immense responsibility , '' Clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness , previewing a brutal five-month general election campaign to come .\nEven without the nomination , Sanders can claim ideological victory . His liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove Clinton to the left on issues such as trade , Wall Street and campaign finance reform .\nBut she prevailed , in part , by claiming much of the coalition that boosted Obama . She won overwhelming support from women and minorities , catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse , delegate-rich states such as New York and Texas .\nWhen Clinton launched her campaign last April , she did so largely unopposed , having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party 's organizational and fundraising infrastructure . Vice President Joe Biden , seen as her most threatening rival , opted not to run in October .\nOf the four opponents who did take her on , Sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge . He caught fire among young voters and independents , his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in Iowa in February and a commanding victory in New Hampshire . His ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring .\nBut Clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates , hiring help from Obama 's old team before launching her campaign . They pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates .\nHer victory in Nevada in late February diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation . Decisive wins in Southern states on Super Tuesday and a sweep of March 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead , which became insurmountable by the end of April after big victories in New York and in the Northeast .\nShe now moves on to face Trump , whose ascent to the top of the Republican Party few expected . The brash real estate mogul and reality TV star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to Clinton , debuting a nickname \u2014 `` Crooked Hillary '' \u2014 and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup .\nAfter a long primary campaign , Clinton said this past weekend in California she was ready to accept his challenge .\n`` We 're judged by our words and our deeds , not our race , not our ethnicity , not our religion , '' she said Saturday in Oxnard . `` So it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds .
