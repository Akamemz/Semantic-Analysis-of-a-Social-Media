    "content": "Two months ago , almost no one was talking about fake news . A Google Trends search for the term shows that it barely registered before October . Now you can hardly turn on the real news without hearing it .\nFake news is a real , specific problem . But in all the furor around who \u2019 s making it , who \u2019 s sharing it , its impact , and how to stop it , it \u2019 s easy to lose sight of something more fundamental : what it is . The broader the definition , the less useful the concept becomes\u2014and it \u2019 s already verging on counterproductive .\nIn recent weeks , the term fake news has been applied by various media sources to everything from Breitbart News to Donald Trump \u2019 s tweets to the media commentary of CNN \u2019 s Brian Stelter . Among the challenges the media faces today , combatting fake news should rank as a relatively straightforward one compared with thornier issues such as bias , sensationalism , and the problem of objectivity . But lumping these together under the banner of fake news makes them all harder to solve . The way to combat actual fakery in journalism is to keep the definition narrow enough that reasonable people across the political spectrum can agree on what does and does not meet the criteria .\nIt helps to remember that the term fake news gained currency in recent months due to a specific and readily identifiable phenomenon . During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign , online entrepreneurs and pranksters found that they could reach huge audiences via social media by fabricating sensational stories that played to readers \u2019 partisan biases . These stories imitated the style and appearance of real news articles , and they were published on sites designed to look like established newspaper websites or political blogs . ( Some pulled this off better than others . ) The key facts were made up by the authors , but the successful ones sounded just plausible enough to pass the smell test of a significant subset of readers who were already primed to believe outlandish things about a given candidate .\nThe most popular of these fake stories and sites have by now become well-known . There was the one about the pope endorsing Donald Trump ; the one about Hillary Clinton selling weapons to ISIS ; the one about an FBI agent found dead after being suspected of leaking Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nAgain , these stories were not simple acts of bad journalism . They were either largely or wholly fictitious , and intentionally so . And for the most part , they were published on obscure , anonymously owned sites that appear to have been created relatively recently for the purpose of publishing fake news , plagiarized or hastily aggregated news , conspiracy theories , propaganda , or a mix of all four . Recent reporting by BuzzFeed , the Washington Post , NPR , and others has exposed the creators of several of the more prominent fake news sites , who have readily admitted that their work was made-up . A surprising number of them originated in Macedonia , where churning out deceptive news stories to a largely pro-Trump audience via Facebook has reportedly become a lucrative cottage industry .\nFake news is the proper term for this sort of content . The word fake means not genuine\u2014a forgery or a counterfeit . It implies an intent to deceive . This phenomenon deserves attention , because the top fake news stories are often shared even more widely than the actual news .\nAlready , Facebook , Google , and third parties across the web are building tools to combat fake news . Some draw on manually compiled lists of disreputable sites . Others rely on user feedback to flag false or misleading stories . The best will probably combine both approaches , along with more subtle signals , like the patterns by which these stories disseminate .\nBut these efforts are already running into controversy at the most fundamental level : disputes over what counts as fake news . That \u2019 s partly because , as the term has entered the national discourse , it has turned out to be a handy cudgel for people who want to criticize the media for a wide range of failings .\nFirst , some in the liberal and mainstream media began to carelessly blur the lines between fabricated news , conspiracy theories , and right-wing opinion by lumping them all under the fake news banner . When Trump tweeted that he had prevented a Ford plant from moving to Mexico , critics were quick to label it \u201c fake news. \u201d As it turned out , the tweet was misleading , but it was based in reality . Even if it were fabricated , a false claim by a politician isn \u2019 t \u201c fake news. \u201d It \u2019 s just a false claim\u2014or a lie , if the falsehood was intentional . A subsequent tweet by Trump , based on an unsubstantiated report from the conspiracy site Infowars , prompted Quartz to call him \u201c editor-in-chief of the fake news movement. \u201d Fact-check : He isn \u2019 t .\nMeanwhile , an academic \u2019 s list of \u201c false , misleading , clickbait-y , and/or satirical \u2018 news \u2019 sources \u201d went viral , and many in the media framed it as an authoritative list of \u201c fake news sites. \u201d The list , compiled by Merrimack College communication professor Melissa Zimdars , presented actual fake news sites such as Abc.com.co alongside openly satirical sites such as the Onion and , most damagingly , conservative blogs such as Breitbart and even Red State , an influential source of political commentary . Zimdars herself readily acknowledged that the list was not limited to fake news . Still , conservatives were understandably inflamed by some mainstream outlets \u2019 embrace of the list , which seemed to raise the specter of crucial distribution platforms like Facebook and Google suppressing conservative opinion as part of their crackdown on fake news .\nTo be clear , there is no evidence that Facebook and Google used Zimdars \u2019 list in any way , and both appear to be taking care not to flag legitimate sites as fake just because they \u2019 re controversial . But New York magazine used the list as the basis for a \u201c handy browser extension \u201d designed to \u201c flag fake news sites \u201d with an automatic pop-up warning . New York added a note clarifying that not all of the sites on the list were fake , and it said its tool had been edited to remove sites that had been unfairly flagged , but that nuance went overlooked amid the outrage . Zimdars has since taken the list down in response to a backlash that included not just legitimate criticism but nasty threats and abuse .\nSpying an opportunity , right-wingers stopped ignoring the fake news discussion and began to co-opt the phrase as a synonym for liberal bias . A Twitter search for the term \u201c fake news \u201d on Tuesday suggested that it has by now crossed over from a liberal rallying cry to a conservative one . Here are three of the most popular tweets that included the phrase :\nThe Hill : Where 's the outrage over Obama 's fake news peddling ? https : //t.co/xPalMHcPvI \u2014 Jack Posobiec ( @ JackPosobiec ) December 6 , 2016\nCNN is putting out fake news that Trump might put Muslims in camps .

They are opinions and analyses with which the tweeters happen to strongly disagree . But throwing the term fake news back at the mainstream media allows the right-wing fringe not only to insult their specific targets , such as CNN , but to devalue the term itself and along with it the idea that there is any clear distinction between truth and fiction . It \u2019 s no surprise that those on the right who have embraced the meme most enthusiastically include conspiracy-mongers such as Infowars , which built its reputation by suggesting that the U.S. government helped orchestrate the Oklahoma City bombing and 9/11 attacks . We \u2019 re now faced with a grim irony in which mainstream news outlets reporting on \u201c Pizzagate \u201d as a fake news story are themselves being labeled fake news outlets by the conspiracy theorists that propagated it .\nThis is not to say that the truth is always simple or that mainstream news outlets are infallible . Lazy journalism is an epidemic in the social media age , and to some degree or another , it probably always has been . Even the most respected outlets , like the New York Times , get things wrong .
