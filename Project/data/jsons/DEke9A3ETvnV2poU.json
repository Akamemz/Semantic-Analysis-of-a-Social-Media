In other words , what if the \u201c real world \u201d is more repressive , more ignorant , and more punitive toward dissenting speech ? What if entire corporations adopt the ideologies and norms of the most ruthless campus social-justice warriors , ruining careers and depriving employees of their livelihoods when those employees dissent from the dominant ideology ?\nIn other words , what if the rest of corporate America starts acting like Google ?\nYesterday former Google employee James Damore filed a class-action lawsuit against Google , alleging systematic race , gender , and political bias against white , male , and conservative employees . Damore , you may recall , was summarily terminated after writing a lengthy memorandum noting that disproportionate male representation in tech fields may be more the result of individual choice and innate differences between men and women than of invidious discrimination . He also suggested some non-discriminatory methods for increasing diversity at Google . Scientists argued about his conclusions \u2014 some agreed with Damore , others vigorously disagreed \u2014 but rather than engage with Damore , Google proved one of his points ( that Google is hostile to dissenting views ) by summarily terminating his employment .\nDamore has now answered Google with a legal broadside , and it \u2019 s extraordinary . Most people don \u2019 t have time to read his entire 181-page complaint , but those who do will find a comprehensive argument that Google \u2019 s corporate culture encourages , sanctions , and facilitates an extraordinary amount of abuse against conservative white males . And he has the receipts . Much of the complaint consists of screen shots of internal Google communications and postings on internal Google message boards that would constitute strong evidence of hostile-environment race-and-gender harassment if the the races and genders were reversed .\nFor example , \u201c Googlers \u201d ( that \u2019 s what employees call themselves , using Google \u2019 s silly corporate language ) relentlessly enforce a so-called \u201c Googley \u201d culture where employees blacklist conservatives ( blocking them from in-house communications ) , actually boo white-male hires , and openly discuss committing acts of violence against political opponents . The \u201c punch a Nazi \u201d debate is alive and well at Google , and the definition of \u201c Nazi \u201d is extraordinarily broad . In one posting , an employee proposes a \u201c moratorium on hiring white cis heterosexual abled men who aren \u2019 t abuse survivors. \u201d In another , an employee advertises a workshop on \u201c healing from toxic whiteness. \u201d Another post mocks \u201c white fragility. \u201d The examples go on and on , for page after page .\nDamore also alleges ( and again , provides screenshots of emails and other communications to support his claims ) that managers actively attacked conservative employees , encouraged punitive actions against dissenters , and even awarded \u201c peer bonuses \u201d for speech attacking conservatives .\nAt the same time that Googlers crack down on standard conservative speech , mock white men , and deride whiteness , they exhibit a remarkable level of tolerance for unusual behavior . For example , Damore claims that \u201c an employee who sexually identifies as a \u2018 yellow-scale wingless dragonkin \u2019 and an \u2018 expansive ornate building \u2019 presented a talk entitled \u2018 living as a plural being \u2019 at an internal company event . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s important to remember that Damore \u2019 s complaint represents his side of the story , and Google has yet to file a response , but the screenshots and images present a compelling prima facie case of racial and gender bias that would be intolerable and illegal in the vast majority of American jurisdictions , including under federal law . It \u2019 s important to remember that American civil-rights law is generally color-blind . In other words , it protects white employees every bit as much as it protects black employees , and conduct that would be unlawful if applied to African Americans or women is also unlawful if applied to whites or males .\nGoogle is of course disproportionately male , but even disproportionately male organizations can commit unlawful acts of discrimination depending on the measures taken to diversify the workplace .
