    "content": "In the first installment of this series , we observed that globalism is an ideology , maybe even a theology . And so of course , globalism generates plenty of passionate support among the planetary elite . And yet passion must be translated into political power . And of course , the globalists have plenty of that , too . In this second installment , we will see how the globalists still seek to get their way , even after losing the 2016 elections . For them , Target # 1 , of course , is Donald Trump .\nEvery Breitbart reader is familiar with the general outlines of the Russia hack story : Beginning in June 2016 , someone or something known as \u201c Guccifer 2.0 \u201d was taking credit for hacking the computers of top Democrats and , working through Julian Assange \u2019 s Wikileaks , doling out juicy information .\nThe hacks were clearly damaging to the Democrats . And because the leaks proved to be true , they had significant repercussions . The revelations forced , for example , the chair of the Democratic National Committee , Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz , to resign last July .\nSoon , the Democrats developed their counter-strategy , which can be summed up as , It \u2019 s Donald Trump \u2019 s fault . That is , whoever and whatever Guccifer was , he or it was doing the hacking to help Trump . So again , Blame Trump !\nBy the fall , the Democrats had a further point to make : The Russians were doing it . So was it , in fact , the Russian spy agencies FSB , or GRU , that were behind the hacks ? Virgil doesn \u2019 t know , but he does know this : The Democrats were accusing the Russians , at least at first , without any solid evidence .\nMeanwhile , at around the same time , the Democrats decided that they themselves should play the Russia Innuendo Game .\nSo beginning in July , rumors began to circulate that an investigation had uncovered bombshell revelations about Trump and the Russians . Yet the evidence was flimsy , at best : it consisted of various statements , attributed to unnamed sources , accusing Trump of various things .\nIn other words , nothing was proven , and so even the Main Stream Media , hungry as it was for anti-Trump hammers , chose not to touch the allegations . The one exception was a vague October 31 item in the left-wing Mother Jones , which reported\u2013perhaps one should say , \u201c reported \u201d \u2014that a \u201c former Western intelligence officer , \u201d hired first by anti-Trump Republicans , and then by Democrats , had assembled a dossier suggesting that Trump had been \u201c compromised \u201d by Russian intelligence .\nThe Mother Jones report was carefully written , mindful that there was no proof and , in fact , no evidence , other than the say-so of one writer , who had been on the payroll of anti-Trump forces . Which is to say , it was nothing\u2014just an opposition-research dump full of unknown unknowns . Indeed , the words could have been for a far-out novel or screenplay .\nYet the Mother Jones story did have one specific nugget : We learned that in a letter to FBI Director James Comey , dated October 30 , Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid had attempted , yet again , to stir the anti-Trump pot . As Reid declared :\nIn my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community , it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump , his top advisors , and the Russian government\u2014a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States .\nYet despite Reid \u2019 s best efforts , the allegations still got no traction : Media outlets , no matter how pro-Hillary , were just not going to attach their credibility to a report that had no demonstrable basis in fact .\nMoreover , it \u2019 s also possible that the Democrats didn \u2019 t push the anti-Trump story as hard as they could have\u2014they were complacent . That is , they thought Hillary Clinton was on her way to victory , and so why rock the boat by raising allegations that might ricochet in some unforeseen direction ? Against , maybe , Bill Clinton ? As Obama himself has said , he and all his advisers were convinced that Hillary was going to win . And so after the election , Obama & Co. assumed , Clinton 45 could clean up whatever mess had been made .\nOf course , all that smugness evaporated after Trump \u2019 s election on November 8 .\nEver since Trump \u2019 s triumph , the anti-Trump drumbeat has grown ever louder . And it \u2019 s not just Democrats . We have since learned , for example , that in December , Republican Sen. John McCain personally delivered anti-Trump allegations to the FBI . And of course , there could have been other political players\u2014many others\u2014involved in the anti-Trump effort .\nIn fact , it \u2019 s accurate to say that the vast bulk of DC officialdom is anti-Trump . Here at Breitbart on December 12 , I took a look at this officialdom ; it \u2019 s been called the \u201c Deep State. \u201d That is , the Deep State is the permanent political combine that runs Washington\u2014or at least tries to . As I defined it a month ago :\nThe term \u201c Deep State \u201d refers to the complex of bureaucrats , technocrats , and plutocrats that likes things just the way they are and wants to keep them like that\u2014elections be damned .\nIt \u2019 s obvious that the last thing that the Deep State wants to see is the DC swamp being drained . To them , it \u2019 s home !\nVirgil wrote again about the Deep State vs. Trump on December 19 , noting that the Deep State will soon have its natural leader , Barack Obama :\nThe 44th president won \u2019 t be going far . Come January , he \u2019 ll be moving just a mile or so uptown , to the swanky Kalorama neighborhood , where , it \u2019 s a safe bet , he \u2019 ll hold court as if he were still president . So the Deep State will still have a rallying point as it plots its next move against the Dreaded Trump . Or should we say , it will have another rallying point , because , in fact , it already has plenty .\nVirgil might note that this story was written three weeks before Politico revealed the soon-to-be ex-president \u2019 s future plans . Here \u2019 s the headline from January 9 : \u201c Obama retools his political operation for another run : He will use his foundation and an updated Organizing for Action group to try to salvage his legacy and rebuild the Democratic Party. \u201d In other words , Obama will be a force to be reckoned with .\nAnd so in that December 19 piece , Virgil closed with these words , which have proven to be prophetic :\nThe bitter election is over , dear reader , but the real storm is still to come .\nSince then , the storm has come on many fronts . Aside from the usual anti-Trump media , Deep Staters are pursuing other angles ; for example , the career staff at the US Department of Justice is targeting FBI Director James Comey for his pre-election handling of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s e-mail case ; it \u2019 s a safe bet that these careerists , enjoying statutory autonomy within DOJ , will find Comey in violation of something .\nMeanwhile , anti-Trump lawyers and other activists from across the country are planning to descend on the Capitol for the Inauguration . And we just learned that Deep Staters stationed in Israel have warned their Israeli counterparts not to trust Trump .\nYet the Deep State is most active inside the DC Beltway : For example , one energetic Deep State anti-Trumper is Walter Shaub , director of the Office of Government Ethics . Yes , he \u2019 s a federal employee , but Shaub has turned his supposedly non-partisan office into a partisan machine , advancing his anti-Trump campaign including , even , on Twitter .\nInterestingly , the research group America \u2019 s Rising has observed that Shaub , a Democrat who donated to Obama \u2019 s 2012 re-election campaign , has never seemed bothered by Hillary Clinton \u2019 s multiple ethical transgressions . As the group puts it :\nShaub \u2019 s history as a Democrat and the double standard he employed as head of the OGE , should give the media pause before taking Shaub \u2019 s words seriously .\nAnd yet of course , Shaub is still in the news all the time , always flailing at Trump . Here , for example , is a January 11 headline in The Hill , describing Shaub \u2019 s latest attack : \u201c Federal ethics chief blasts \u2018 meaningless \u2019 Trump business plan. \u201d And this , from Politico : \u201c Federal ethics czar delivers broadside against Trump conflicts plan . \u201d\nYet the biggest broadsides , of course , have been over the question of Russian influence in the US . Even if reporters stayed away from scurrilous rumors that couldn \u2019 t be proven , they nevertheless pursued other angles , notably , that the Russians had a strategy for helping Trump defeat Hillary .\nIn this effort , of course , journos were greatly aided by Deep Staters .\nFor example , in mid-December , Politico Europe added the detail\u2014make that the alleged , as opposed to proven , detail\u2014that Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u201c personally directed \u201d the hacking effort , as part of his supposed \u201c vendetta \u201d against Hillary Clinton . Is that true ? Who knows . But Politico got the story , it wrote , from \u201c multiple senior intelligence officials . \u201d\nThen , last week , the story heated up even hotter . And the flashpoint was that dubious dossier\u2014the one , as we have noted , that had been floating around for months .\nRecently , the \u201c Big Four \u201d intel chiefs\u2014that would be Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , FBI Director Comey , CIA Director John Brennan , and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers\u2014decided that the document was worth taking seriously after all . That is , the \u201c Western \u201d operative mentioned by Mother Jones\u2014publicly identified recently as a Briton , Christopher Steele , a former British MI-6 spy\u2014was suddenly given a promotion ; now , he and his info were deemed to be a credible source . So credible , in fact , that the Big Four needed to tell Trump all about it .\nSo last week , the President-elect was briefed on some of the allegations by senior US intelligence officials . And here \u2019 s what \u2019 s strange : Even though that quartet of Deep Staters is supposed to be good at keeping secrets , the news of that briefing immediately leaked .\nAs The Washington Post reported on January 10 , one top official said that Trump was briefed on the allegations \u201c because they were already circulating widely and it was \u2018 mostly a courtesy \u2019 to let him know they were out there . \u201d\nTo which Virgil can say , that \u2019 s some kind of \u201c courtesy \u201d ! In fact , it seems to have been more like a set-up . Let \u2019 s think about it : Scurrilous rumors about Trump have been floating around for months , rumbling below the level of newsworthiness , and yet the Intel Quartet says that , as a \u201c courtesy , \u201d they will tell Trump about the rumors , and then blab about it to the press . That \u2019 s not courtesy , that \u2019 s chutzpah .\nAnd so of course , components of the briefing , the saucy parts , became huge news . After all , the Intel Quartet , in telling Trump about the charges , had given them a kind of pseudo-truthiness\u2014and had certainly made them newsworthy . So now , for the MSM , it was open season on Trump .\nPolitico , always the expert at stirring up the Beltway , blared its January 10 headline , \u201c Trump confronts firestorm of Russia allegations. \u201d The story quoted Adam Jentleson , a former top aide to Harry Reid , as tweeting out , in all-capital letters , \u201c THIS IS WHAT HARRY REID WAS REFERRING TO. \u201d That is , referring back to Reid \u2019 s October 30 letter to FBI Director Comey . ( We might pause to note that Jentleson is now running a \u201c war room \u201d for the Center for American Progress , which is to say , his full time job is now sending out all-caps political blasts . )\nCNN ran hard with the Trump story . It was \u201c breaking news , \u201d the channel declared , that \u201c the nation \u2019 s top intelligence officials \u201d had briefed both Trump ( and , at other times , Obama and Joe Biden ) on information that \u201c compromised President-elect Trump . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Team Trump hotly denied all of it . On ABC News \u2019 \u201c Good Morning America , \u201d Kellyanne Conway said :\nJust to smear the president-elect of the United States , we now have intelligence officials divulging information that they are sworn not to divulge . I don \u2019 t even think this is fake news , I think this is just fake .\nFor his part , Trump was wise to what the Deep State was doing to him . Deriding his enemies as \u201c sick people , \u201d he tweeted :\nIntelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \u201c leak \u201d into the public . One last shot at me . Are we living in Nazi Germany ?\nAs we have come to expect , that was some tough talk from Trump . And yet his obvious anger aside , the President-elect was also shrewdly firming up his base , which has long believed the worst about the MSM and the Deep State .\nIndeed , in that January 11 press conference , Trump seized the opportunity to go on the offensive . He not only dismissed the accusations , but he also labeled CNN as \u201c fake news , \u201d no doubt provoking loud cheers all across Trump Nation .\nAnd the President-elect recalled how he had been set up by the Intel Quartet : \u201c Every time I meet [ with the officials ] , people are reading about it. \u201d He added that it \u2019 s \u201c very unfair that it happened , very unfair to the American people . \u201d\nThus Trump rallied his support ; on January 12 , Politico Playbook , an e-mail tipsheet for DC insiders and wannabe insiders , had to grudgingly admit , \u201c For most people who watched Trump yesterday , it was a pretty good performance . \u201d\nYet of course , Trump \u2019 s harshest critics are , well , still harsh . So it \u2019 s fair to say that the forces on both sides of the battleline\u2014pro-Trump and anti-Trump\u2014have now redoubled their resolve .\nHere we can pause to note that the intelligence officials apparently delivered only a dry two-page summary of the allegations ; we can call that the Little Smear . Yet there was also a longer , 35-page heap of allegations , including sexual allegations ; we can call that the Big Smear .\nThe leading player in the Big Smear was BuzzFeed , an online publication founded by one Jonah Peretti , who had earlier learned his trade at The Huffington Post . Yes , the website printed the full 35-page dossier , complete with its sexual salaciousness . ( Once again , we must immediately stipulate that there \u2019 s zero proof that any of the charges are true . )\nAmazingly , at the same time that he published this slime , BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith tweeted out , \u201c There is serious reason to doubt the allegations . \u201d\nVirgil \u2019 s not a lawyer , but it sure seems to him that Smith \u2019 s admission meets the legal standard for defamation , including \u201c reckless disregard for the truth. \u201d As one legal resource puts it :\nIf the person defamed was a public figure , the person making the defamatory statement can only be held liable for defamation if he/she knew that the statement was false or if he/she acted with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of the statement . [ emphasis added ]\nMeanwhile , criticism from others in the media came cascading down on Buzzfeed . Speaking for the MSM , NBC News \u2019 Chuck Todd put it right in the face of BuzzFeed \u2019 s Ben Smith :\nYou just published fake news . You made a knowing decision to put out an untruth .\nSmith answered by saying , \u201c I think this is a real story about a real document. \u201d To which we can say , yes , it is a real document , in the sense that it has words on a page . But that doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s a true document . As in , every single word on every single page could be a lie\u2014and BuzzFeed offered the reader no help in verifying anything .\nMeanwhile , other MSM-ers weighed in . The Wall Street Journal reported , in its mild way , \u201c The Journal hasn \u2019 t been able to verify the allegations. \u201d At the same time , two Washington Post media writers , Margaret Sullivan and Erik Wemple , denounced Buzzfeed \u2019 s decision . And on January 12 , DC veteran Mike Allen\u2013formerly at Politico , now at a new start-up , Axios\u2014dismissed the allegations :\nThink about the half day of madness that started when BuzzFeed posted , in full , an unsubstantiated , one-source memo , funded by partisans , that claimed acts \u2014 too disgusting to print \u2014 by the man a week from the Oval Office .\nThat is , Allen was saying , nothing is going to come of this .\nIn the meantime , on the orthodox conservative right , National Review \u2019 s David French , himself strongly anti-Trump , wrote of the BuzzFeed story :\nThis is ridiculous . How can \u201c Americans make up their own minds \u201d when they have no ability to fact-check the allegations ? The public knows nothing about the sources , nothing about the underlying claims , and has no means of discovering the truth . . . . This isn \u2019 t transparency ; it \u2019 s malice .\nBuzzFeed \u2019 s story is clearly fake news . Any media outlet that does not produce a news story that declares BuzzFeed \u2019 s story fake news is giving aid and comfort to fake news and furthering its proliferation . This fiasco is exactly why the media \u2019 s ratings are in the toilet .\nAnd here \u2019 s Glenn Greenwald , writing for The Intercept , hard-hitting as always . Under the headline , \u201c The Deep State Goes to War with President-Elect , Using Unverified Claims , as Democrats Cheer , \u201d Greenwald declared any publication of the material to be \u201c an assault on journalism , democracy , and basic human rationality . \u201d\nGreenwald \u2019 s critique notwithstanding , the MSM is now having its cake and eating it too . That is , it can claim \u201c clean hands \u201d in not printing the allegations at first , and yet now that they \u2019 re out , it can happily reprint the allegations ; after all , someone else printed them first , thereby making them \u201c news. \u201d Thus it is that casual references to the dossier are now finding their way into MSM stories about the Trump administration , not just stories about the Russia allegations . This is the MSM daisy-chain : a happy circle of anti-Trumpism . Americans might not like it , but MSM-ers sure do .\nMeanwhile , another acute observer , Matt Drudge , wondered if the Russians were even involved at all . That is , perhaps it was the Deep State itself cranking out the allegations , while throwing the blame at Moscow :\nAre corrupt US intel agencies blackmailing Trump with their own dirt cleverly tagged to \u201c Russian \u201d operatives ?\nInterestingly , amidst this backlash against the now-notorious bad briefing , one of the briefers , James Clapper , has chosen to distance himself from the others . Late in the evening of January 11 , he issued a statement declaring that the intelligence agencies had \u201c not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable. \u201d To which Virgil says : \u201c Nice try , Mr. Clapper , but the time to speak up about your concerns was before the briefing , or during the briefing , not after the briefing\u2014after the bleep hit the fan . \u201d\nOf course , Clapper \u2019 s retrospective regrets notwithstanding , the Deep State is full speed ahead , still seeking to torpedo Trump .\nFor example , former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook compares the matter to Watergate . The implication is clear enough : Just as the Deep State succeeding in driving Richard Nixon out of office back in 1974 , now today , the Deep State should seek the same fate for Trump .\nOf course , Trump is not planning on going anywhere ; in fact , it \u2019 s been reported that staffers are already working on his 2020 re-election campaign .\nNext : The Deep State opens up another front against Trump .",
    "content_original": "Second of Three Parts\u2026\n\nIn the first installment of this series, we observed that globalism is an ideology, maybe even a theology. And so of course, globalism generates plenty of passionate support among the planetary elite. And yet passion must be translated into political power. And of course, the globalists have plenty of that, too. In this second installment, we will see how the globalists still seek to get their way, even after losing the 2016 elections. For them, Target #1, of course, is Donald Trump.\n\n1. The Weaponization of Rumors\n\nEvery Breitbart reader is familiar with the general outlines of the Russia hack story: Beginning in June 2016, someone or something known as \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d was taking credit for hacking the computers of top Democrats and, working through Julian Assange\u2019s Wikileaks, doling out juicy information.\n\nThe hacks were clearly damaging to the Democrats.

Virgil doesn\u2019t know, but he does know this: The Democrats were accusing the Russians, at least at first, without any solid evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, at around the same time, the Democrats decided that they themselves should play the Russia Innuendo Game.\n\nSo beginning in July, rumors began to circulate that an investigation had uncovered bombshell revelations about Trump and the Russians.

And so after the election, Obama & Co. assumed, Clinton 45 could clean up whatever mess had been made.\n\nOf course, all that smugness evaporated after Trump\u2019s election on November 8.\n\n2. The Deep State Makes Its Moves\n\nEver since Trump\u2019s triumph, the anti-Trump drumbeat has grown ever louder. And it\u2019s not just Democrats. We have since learned, for example, that in December, Republican Sen. John McCain personally delivered anti-Trump allegations to the FBI. And of course, there could have been other political players\u2014many others\u2014involved in the anti-Trump effort.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s accurate to say that the vast bulk of DC officialdom is anti-Trump. Here at Breitbart on December 12, I took a look at this officialdom; it\u2019s been called the \u201cDeep State.\u201d That is, the Deep State is the permanent political combine that runs Washington\u2014or at least tries to.

Here, for example, is a January 11 headline in The Hill, describing Shaub\u2019s latest attack: \u201cFederal ethics chief blasts \u2018meaningless\u2019 Trump business plan.\u201d And this, from Politico: \u201cFederal ethics czar delivers broadside against Trump conflicts plan.\u201d\n\nYet the biggest broadsides, of course, have been over the question of Russian influence in the US.

Is that true? Who knows. But Politico got the story, it wrote, from \u201cmultiple senior intelligence officials.\u201d\n\n3. The Battle of the Beltway\n\nThen, last week, the story heated up even hotter. And the flashpoint was that dubious dossier\u2014the one, as we have noted, that had been floating around for months.\n\nRecently, the \u201cBig Four\u201d intel chiefs\u2014that would be Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers\u2014decided that the document was worth taking seriously after all.

And here\u2019s what\u2019s strange: Even though that quartet of Deep Staters is supposed to be good at keeping secrets, the news of that briefing immediately leaked.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported on January 10, one top official said that Trump was briefed on the allegations \u201cbecause they were already circulating widely and it was \u2018mostly a courtesy\u2019 to let him know they were out there.\u201d\n\nTo which Virgil can say, that\u2019s some kind of \u201ccourtesy\u201d! In fact, it seems to have been more like a set-up. Let\u2019s think about it: Scurrilous rumors about Trump have been floating around for months, rumbling below the level of newsworthiness, and yet the Intel Quartet says that, as a \u201ccourtesy,\u201d they will tell Trump about the rumors, and then blab about it to the press. That\u2019s not courtesy, that\u2019s chutzpah.\n\nAnd so of course, components of the briefing, the saucy parts, became huge news. After all, the Intel Quartet, in telling Trump about the charges, had given them a kind of pseudo-truthiness\u2014and had certainly made them newsworthy. So now, for the MSM, it was open season on Trump.\n\nPolitico, always the expert at stirring up the Beltway, blared its January 10 headline, \u201cTrump confronts firestorm of Russia allegations.\u201d The story quoted Adam Jentleson, a former top aide to Harry Reid, as tweeting out, in all-capital letters, \u201cTHIS IS WHAT HARRY REID WAS REFERRING TO.\u201d That is, referring back to Reid\u2019s October 30 letter to FBI Director Comey. (We might pause to note that Jentleson is now running a \u201cwar room\u201d for the Center for American Progress, which is to say, his full time job is now sending out all-caps political blasts.)\n\nCNN ran hard with the Trump story. It was \u201cbreaking news,\u201d the channel declared, that \u201cthe nation\u2019s top intelligence officials\u201d had briefed both Trump (and, at other times, Obama and Joe Biden) on information that \u201ccompromised President-elect Trump.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Team Trump hotly denied all of it. On ABC News\u2019 \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Kellyanne Conway said:\n\nJust to smear the president-elect of the United States, we now have intelligence officials divulging information that they are sworn not to divulge. I don\u2019t even think this is fake news, I think this is just fake.\n\nFor his part, Trump was wise to what the Deep State was doing to him. Deriding his enemies as \u201csick people,\u201d he tweeted:\n\nIntelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \u201cleak\u201d into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?\n\nAs we have come to expect, that was some tough talk from Trump. And yet his obvious anger aside, the President-elect was also shrewdly firming up his base, which has long believed the worst about the MSM and the Deep State.\n\nIndeed, in that January 11 press conference, Trump seized the opportunity to go on the offensive. He not only dismissed the accusations, but he also labeled CNN as \u201cfake news,\u201d no doubt provoking loud cheers all across Trump Nation.\n\nAnd the President-elect recalled how he had been set up by the Intel Quartet: \u201cEvery time I meet [with the officials], people are reading about it.\u201d He added that it\u2019s \u201cvery unfair that it happened, very unfair to the American people.\u201d\n\nThus Trump rallied his support; on January 12, Politico Playbook, an e-mail tipsheet for DC insiders and wannabe insiders, had to grudgingly admit, \u201cFor most people who watched Trump yesterday, it was a pretty good performance.\u201d\n\nYet of course, Trump\u2019s harshest critics are, well, still harsh. So it\u2019s fair to say that the forces on both sides of the battleline\u2014pro-Trump and anti-Trump\u2014have now redoubled their resolve.\n\nHere we can pause to note that the intelligence officials apparently delivered only a dry two-page summary of the allegations; we can call that the Little Smear. Yet there was also a longer, 35-page heap of allegations, including sexual allegations; we can call that the Big Smear.\n\nThe leading player in the Big Smear was BuzzFeed, an online publication founded by one Jonah Peretti, who had earlier learned his trade at The Huffington Post. Yes, the website printed the full 35-page dossier, complete with its sexual salaciousness. (Once again, we must immediately stipulate that there\u2019s zero proof that any of the charges are true.)\n\nAmazingly, at the same time that he published this slime, BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith tweeted out, \u201cThere is serious reason to doubt the allegations.\u201d\n\nVirgil\u2019s not a lawyer, but it sure seems to him that Smith\u2019s admission meets the legal standard for defamation, including \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d As one legal resource puts it:\n\nIf the person defamed was a public figure, the person making the defamatory statement can only be held liable for defamation if he/she knew that the statement was false or if he/she acted with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of the statement. [emphasis added]\n\nHello, lawsuit?\n\nMeanwhile, criticism from others in the media came cascading down on Buzzfeed. Speaking for the MSM, NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd put it right in the face of BuzzFeed\u2019s Ben Smith:\n\nYou just published fake news. You made a knowing decision to put out an untruth.\n\nSmith answered by saying, \u201cI think this is a real story about a real document.\u201d To which we can say, yes, it is a real document, in the sense that it has words on a page. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a true document. As in, every single word on every single page could be a lie\u2014and BuzzFeed offered the reader no help in verifying anything.\n\nMeanwhile, other MSM-ers weighed in. The Wall Street Journal reported, in its mild way, \u201cThe Journal hasn\u2019t been able to verify the allegations.\u201d At the same time, two Washington Post media writers, Margaret Sullivan and Erik Wemple, denounced Buzzfeed\u2019s decision. And on January 12, DC veteran Mike Allen\u2013formerly at Politico, now at a new start-up, Axios\u2014dismissed the allegations:\n\nThink about the half day of madness that started when BuzzFeed posted, in full, an unsubstantiated, one-source memo, funded by partisans, that claimed acts \u2014 too disgusting to print \u2014 by the man a week from the Oval Office.\n\nThat is, Allen was saying, nothing is going to come of this.\n\nIn the meantime, on the orthodox conservative right, National Review\u2019s David French, himself strongly anti-Trump, wrote of the BuzzFeed story:\n\nThis is ridiculous. How can \u201cAmericans make up their own minds\u201d when they have no ability to fact-check the allegations? The public knows nothing about the sources, nothing about the underlying claims, and has no means of discovering the truth. . . . This isn\u2019t transparency; it\u2019s malice.\n\nAnd conservative media watchdog Brent Bozell threw this punch:\n\nBuzzFeed\u2019s story is clearly fake news. Any media outlet that does not produce a news story that declares BuzzFeed\u2019s story fake news is giving aid and comfort to fake news and furthering its proliferation. This fiasco is exactly why the media\u2019s ratings are in the toilet.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Glenn Greenwald, writing for The Intercept, hard-hitting as always. Under the headline, \u201cThe Deep State Goes to War with President-Elect, Using Unverified Claims, as Democrats Cheer,\u201d Greenwald declared any publication of the material to be \u201can assault on journalism, democracy, and basic human rationality.\u201d\n\nGreenwald\u2019s critique notwithstanding, the MSM is now having its cake and eating it too. That is, it can claim \u201cclean hands\u201d in not printing the allegations at first, and yet now that they\u2019re out, it can happily reprint the allegations; after all, someone else printed them first, thereby making them \u201cnews.\u201d Thus it is that casual references to the dossier are now finding their way into MSM stories about the Trump administration, not just stories about the Russia allegations. This is the MSM daisy-chain: a happy circle of anti-Trumpism. Americans might not like it, but MSM-ers sure do.\n\nMeanwhile, another acute observer, Matt Drudge, wondered if the Russians were even involved at all. That is, perhaps it was the Deep State itself cranking out the allegations, while throwing the blame at Moscow:\n\nAre corrupt US intel agencies blackmailing Trump with their own dirt cleverly tagged to \u201cRussian\u201d operatives?\n\nInterestingly, amidst this backlash against the now-notorious bad briefing, one of the briefers, James Clapper, has chosen to distance himself from the others. Late in the evening of January 11, he issued a statement declaring that the intelligence agencies had \u201cnot made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable.\u201d To which Virgil says: \u201cNice try, Mr. Clapper, but the time to speak up about your concerns was before the briefing, or during the briefing, not after the briefing\u2014after the bleep hit the fan.\u201d\n\nOf course, Clapper\u2019s retrospective regrets notwithstanding, the Deep State is full speed ahead, still seeking to torpedo Trump.\n\nFor example, former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook compares the matter to Watergate. The implication is clear enough: Just as the Deep State succeeding in driving Richard Nixon out of office back in 1974, now today, the Deep State should seek the same fate for Trump.\n\nOf course, Trump is not planning on going anywhere; in fact, it\u2019s been reported that staffers are already working on his 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nSo the Battle of the Beltway will continue.\n\nNext: The Deep State opens up another front against Trump.",
