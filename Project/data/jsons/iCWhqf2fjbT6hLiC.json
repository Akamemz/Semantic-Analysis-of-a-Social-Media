    "content": "Even if only to protect the American mainland from Pyongyang \u2019 s aggressions , it is critical that we have the ability to shoot an ICBM from the sky .\nLast week , North Korea launched a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido , sending residents scrambling for shelter . The missile was the second Kim Jong-Un \u2019 s regime has fired over its eastern neighbor in a month , and these tests come dangerously close to acts of war , especially considering North Korea \u2019 s statement that the Kim regime plans to \u201c sink \u201d Japan should sanctions continue .\nSo why didn \u2019 t Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe order his military to shoot down the missile ? And why didn \u2019 t President Donald Trump or Secretary of Defense James Mattis do the same ? While the missile crossed Japanese airspace , intercepting it wouldn \u2019 t have been an act of war . Plus , the Sea of Japan , the Pacific Ocean , and Hokkaido itself are dotted with missile-defense systems .\nIn fact , these systems were powerless against the KN-17 launched by North Korea last Friday . The ICBM was flying too fast and too high for the Japanese Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptors stationed at Hokkaido \u2019 s Chitose Air Base to have an effective shot at it . While those interceptors are designed to shoot down missiles in the final phase of flight , ships equipped with the Aegis system and armed with SM-3 interceptors throughout the Sea of Japan and Pacific Ocean could \u2019 ve intercepted the North Korean missile , but only if they had been in the right position when it passed over Hokkaido . Last Friday , they weren \u2019 t , and given that the missile barely grazed the outer limit of their range , it likely wouldn \u2019 t have mattered if they had been .\nBut poorly-placed and unreliable interceptors in the Pacific aren \u2019 t the only holes in America \u2019 s missile-defense system . Should North Korea launch a missile over Guam , Hawaii , or parts of Alaska , for example , the U.S. military can not order residents to seek shelter while praying it \u2019 s just a test . Preemptive preparations today are essential to protecting the U.S. from the rapid development of the Kim regime \u2019 s missile program and ending its aggressive behavior . Especially considering North Korea \u2019 s close militaristic relationship with Iran \u2014 a power itself only held at bay by a weak deal whose status is still up in the air \u2014 defensive and offensive action is our best bet to prevent an attack in the future .\nMany , including Mattis , believe the United States \u2019 s next step should be shooting down North Korean test missiles . While such preemptive strikes will escalate tensions with the Kim regime , if successful they will also demonstrate the futility of an attack on the U.S. Before Mattis and the Trump administration can perform them with any certainty , however , the nation \u2019 s missile-defense system must reach a level of reliability that can guarantee success . Such preemptive maneuvers , therefore , work in concert : A reliable missile-defense system not only allows the U.S. to shoot down a North Korean test missile but also protects it in the event the Kim regime decides to launch an attack on U.S. territories .\nSince last week \u2019 s test , Japan has already begun closing some of the gaps in its defensive network on Hokkaido . The Japanese military has deployed two more PAC-3 units to undisclosed locations on the island , intended to protect against a North Korean attack . The U.S. , too , has expanded its defense network in response to the North Korean threat , by deploying additional THAAD systems to bases in southeast South Korea .\nCurrently , the U.S. has 16 warships equipped with Aegis \u2014 a defense system capable of launching interceptors like the SM-3 in the final stage of flight and , to a much lesser degree , the late mid-course stage \u2014 stationed in the Pacific . That fleet is not nearly large enough to protect the entire area a North Korean missile could cover with any degree of certainty . Plus , two of the ships homeported in Japan , the USS Fitzgerald and the USS John S McCain , were damaged in collisions earlier this year , reducing the functional fleet size to 14 . For Aegis to work , the ship must be in the right place at the right time , an additional challenge given our lack of intelligence prior to North Korean launches . By Fiscal Year 2020 , the U.S. does plan to increase its Aegis fleet size from 33 to 51 , but where the ships will dock is as of yet undisclosed .\nSM-3-equipped Aegis , THAAD , and PAC-3 systems deployed by the U.S. and Japan , however , are most effective against a missile \u2019 s final phase , so while they might function well for protecting Japan and South Korea or intercepting a test missile , they don \u2019 t really protect America against a North Korean ICBM . The best defense against a direct attack is our Ground-Based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ) system , whose Ground-Based Interceptor ( GBI ) is capable of intercepting an ICBM from sites in Fort Greely , Alaska and Fort Vandenberg , California . By the end of 2017 , the DOD plans to install 14 additional missiles in Alaska , and in a May test , a GBI from the California base successfully destroyed an ICBM fired nearly 4,200 miles away in the Marshall Islands .\nIncreased deployment is a good start , but it doesn \u2019 t fix the massive unreliability of the U.S. \u2019 s missile-defense programs .\nIncreased deployment is a good start , but it doesn \u2019 t fix the massive unreliability of the U.S. \u2019 s missile-defense programs . The GMD is a good example : While the May test inspired public confidence in the system , its overall record tells a different story . Only ten of 18 tests have been successful since the program began . Since January of 2010 , the system has worked only twice out of five tests , and the 2017 test was the first in three years . Our missile-defense systems are \u201c not postured to shoot down North Korean missile tests , \u201d Kingston Reif , the director of disarmament and threat-reduction policy at the Arms Control Association , told Fox News . He \u2019 s absolutely right \u2014 under the Obama administration , significant cuts in defense funding fueled by a miscalculation of the North Korea threat and a controversial Cold War-era strategy set the U.S. \u2019 s missile-defense program back several years . Today , it remains woefully inchoate .\nOne such cut was to the boost-phase interception program , which , in theory , could solve many of the reliability problems with the U.S. \u2019 s missile-defense system . While in boost , the first phase of launch , the missile emits a bright heat signature and a payload of highly-combustible fuel , making it easier to track and destroy . Missing a boost-phase interception isn \u2019 t game over ; systems farther down the line , like the GMD and Aegis , have another shot at the ICBM before it reaches its target . As Joe Cirincione , a former staffer for the House Committee on Armed Services and a nuclear-policy expert , wrote in Defense One , the main problem with intercepting the KN-17 launched by North Korea on Friday was its altitude : It flew higher than any theater ( mid-range ) ballistic missile-defense system in existence , let alone any it flew over , could reach with confidence . But in boost phase , height isn \u2019 t a problem . The major roadblock in boost intercept is timing and location : A boost-phase intercept must be conducted within the first three minutes of launch , and the defensive unit must be incredibly close to the launch site .\nTwo cancelled boost programs would be especially valuable in addressing North Korean missile tests . First is the Space-Based Intercept ( SBI ) program , which , because it is a passive defense mechanism , cuts down on the need to reallocate resources and relieves pressure on the positioning problems of other defense systems . The second program , Airborne Laser ( ABL ) , which is essentially a high-powered laser attached to a plane , was testing well before the Obama administration scrapped it , and reviving it would be expensive but easier than reviving SBI . If manufacturers can increase its range , ABL is the best boost-phase option for dealing with the North Korean threat .\nOnly once these gaps are filled can a preemptive offensive intercept of a test missile be a strategic option , given both the geopolitical issues that accompany such a strike and the need for the intercept to be successful . While Mattis has not specified the details of such an action , only establishing that North Korea \u2019 s \u201c provocations . . . press against the envelope , \u201d experts agree that it would constitute an act of war if it occurred over North Korean territory or international waters . So the U.S. will first have to secure support from Japan or other allies , like South Korea , for an intercept .\nOf course , this means that boost-phase and , to a degree , GMD systems wouldn \u2019 t be helpful in preemptive offense , leaving SM-3 , PAC-3 , and THAAD responsible for the interception . As Friday indicated , they aren \u2019 t ready for such a responsibility . And reliability is crucial if such a strike is to be successful . Speaking to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , former Illinois senator Mark Kirk agreed that intercepting a North Korean test is a \u201c wise \u201d step in deterring the North Korean threat , but recognized that it \u2019 s \u201c very important that [ the interception ] works. \u201d Failure would show the Kim regime weakness and vulnerability , counteracting the strike \u2019 s intended message of strength and impermeability and undermining President Trump \u2019 s promises of militaristic \u201c fire and fury . \u201d\nIt is critical that we have the ability to knock ICBMs out of the sky in the face of North Korean provocations . Even if that ability doesn \u2019 t deter the Kim regime from its relentless missile testing , at least Americans won \u2019 t have to live in the state of suspended fear experienced on Hokkaido . But until we fix the holes in our missile-defense network , such a luxury will remain a pipe dream . In the U.S. \u2019 s high-stakes chess match against North Korea , a good defense comes before a good offense .",
