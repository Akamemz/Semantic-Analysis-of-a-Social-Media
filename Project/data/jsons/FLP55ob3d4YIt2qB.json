That dip could have been due to government efforts to constrain credit growth , but many believe that Trump \u2019 s tariffs hurt business confidence and slowed investment . That makes sense , since any company thinking about making their products in China would have to worry that Trump would make it hard to sell those products in the U.S .

So far , farmers haven \u2019 t abandoned Trump politically , but the threat is clearly there .\nThis demonstrates why China was always in a better position to win a trade war with the U.S. China \u2019 s autocratic regime is much less vulnerable to the shifting winds of politics than the U.S. \u2019 s democratically elected politicians . Also , China much more recently escaped from poverty , and its residents are more accustomed to enduring economic hardship .

A trade truce with China , enacted in late 2018 , left most of the U.S. \u2019 s biggest goals -- intellectual property theft , currency manipulation , forced technology transfer and access to the Chinese market -- unfulfilled . Essentially , China will buy more U.S. farm products and a few other exports , and Trump will back off . A final deal is likely to look even more like an ignominious defeat for the Trump administration .\nMeanwhile , there are signs that the Chinese slowdown has bottomed out , as the government unleashes some fresh stimulus .\nBut tariffs are only one aspect of the trade war . Although it has been less in the public eye , the struggle to control the future of high technology is arguably even more important to the balance of economic power between the U.S. and China . And the U.S. may also be losing on this front as well .\nThe U.S. has recently been putting pressure on Huawei Technologies Co. , China \u2019 s leading telecommunications manufacturer . It has tried to pressure American allies not to buy 5G wireless technology from the company , which some believe to be an arm of the Chinese military . American security services worry that Huawei-made 5G products would be able to spy on communications around the world . But in a big blow to that effort , Germany recently said it would not shut Huawei out .\nMeanwhile , the U.S. has implemented export controls on many technology products . Many Chinese manufacturers rely on sophisticated American technology -- for example , some Chinese circuit makers rely on U.S.-made semiconductors . Export controls will hurt Chinese tech in the short term , but in the long term it could merely push China to accelerate its efforts to replicate and surpass U.S. technology . In the past , the U.S. has benefitted from retaining the high-value parts of the supply chain , even as it outsourced the lower-value parts to China . But if China becomes a technological peer , its companies will begin to compete more directly with American ones , as Japanese companies did in the 1970s and 1980s .\nSo Trump \u2019 s trade war is looking shaky on all fronts . His ferocious attacks inflicted some damage , but China could take the losses , and is now battling back with great effectiveness . It turns out that trade wars weren \u2019 t quite as easy to win as Trump believed .",
