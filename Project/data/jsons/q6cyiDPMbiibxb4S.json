In a poll conducted by Vox and Morning Consult during the first week in April , they found that supporters for Sen. Bernie Sanders unsurprisingly have strong support for things like free college tuition and universal health care . They register at 70+ percent in favor for both initiatives . Then , the question turns to how much are they willing to pay for Sanders ' agenda . This is where support dips dramatically , especially when two in three Bernie-ites don \u2019 t want to pay more than $ 1,000 for a single-payer health care system . Furthermore , the amount that Sanders supporters are willing to pay for this socialist utopia doesn \u2019 t cover the costs that this disheveled democratic socialist has in store for the country ( via Vox ) :\nAbout 66 percent of Sanders supporters said they would n't be willing to pay more than an additional $ 1,000 in taxes for universal health care . This includes the 8 percent of Sanders supporters who are n't willing to pay anything at all . When we asked what percentage of their income they would pay , rather than a dollar figure , voters seem to be a bit more generous . While half of Sanders supporters said they are n't willing to pay or that they 're only willing to pay less than 5 percent of their income , a quarter said they would pay between 5 and 10 percent . [ \u2026 ] Sanders supporters are far and away the most likely to want free public college tuition . Still , 14 percent said they do n't want to pay additional taxes for it \u2014 and another half said they would only pay up to $ 1,000 a year [ \u2026 ] Sanders 's plan would put an additional $ 5,000 of federal tax liability on households earning $ 50,000 , but in exchange he would nationalize vital services currently in the private sector . That means at least some of the money we 're now paying private companies would be paid to the federal government instead . But the majority of Sanders supporters in our poll ( much less all voters ) are n't willing to pay enough to actually support those nationalized services .\nIt \u2019 s the classic case we see often in these top-down , controlled economic experiments . The costs are too great and the system eventually collapses due to lack of money . This economy , where vital services are completely in the hands of government , has been a total disaster for other countries . Just look at Greece . Yet , it does undercut the one of the main points pushed by Sanders on the campaign trail , which is that he is at the head of a political revolution that seeks to make America fairer by destroying the job creating and investing class and usurping a corrupt campaign finance system that Democrats have used to win back-to-back presidential elections . It \u2019 s hard to say this with this poll data that shows his most ardent backers don \u2019 t want to pay for anything he \u2019 s promising ; they just want it . Moreover , it \u2019 s hard to say that we \u2019 re seeing the vestiges of some left wing swell in American politics when you can \u2019 t win in the South . It \u2019 s not a revolution then\u2013it \u2019 s just some senior citizen saying what dumb college students want to hear . Alas , that \u2019 s the core of Sanders \u2019 base\u00ad : young , college-educated whites . That \u2019 s not really earth shattering , especially when you consider that Democrats have been losing the white vote nationally since the 1960s . Still , funny to see how the political left wants a ton of stuff from the government , but has no desire to pay for it .",
