A partial video of his remarks provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 includes Bertolini responding to a question about single-payer health care .\n\u201c In the news media , it is reporting that the Republican health plan is paving the way to a single-payer system , \u201d an Aetna employee asks Bertolini . \u201c What are your thoughts on that , and how would it impact Aetna ? \u201d\nSingle-payer , I think we should have that debate as a nation . But let me remind everybody that Aetna was the first financial intermediary for Medicare . We cut the first check for Medicare in 1965 to Hartford Hospital for $ 517.57 . The government doesn \u2019 t administer anything . the first thing they \u2019 ve ever tried to administer in social programs was the ACA , and that didn \u2019 t go so well . So the industry has always been the back room for government . If the government wants to pay all the bills , and employers want to stop offering coverage , and we can be there in a public private partnership to do the work we do today with Medicare , and with Medicaid at every state level , we run the Medicaid programs for them , then let \u2019 s have that conversation . But if we want to turn it all over to the government to run , is the government really the right place to run all this stuff ? And that \u2019 s the debate that needs to be had . They could finance it , and if there is one financer , and you could call that single-payer . ... We \u2019 re going to pay for it one way or another . What we have to do is we have to get the costs right . We have to get people healthy . It \u2019 s not about who is paying the bill . It \u2019 s about what we \u2019 re doing to get the costs down . The Democrats are now saying that with the new Republican bill , wait there is nothing in here about getting costs down . That \u2019 s the point . And so that \u2019 s the place we \u2019 re headed as a company . It \u2019 s not just about paying the bills .\nWhat Bertolini seems open to is a version of single-payer where the federal government would contract out certain functions private companies , such as Aetna .
