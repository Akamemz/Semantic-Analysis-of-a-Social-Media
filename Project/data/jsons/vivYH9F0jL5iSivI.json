    "content": "The reason , as I have written before , is that no president\u2014not Barack Obama and not Donald Trump\u2014has the authority under the Constitution to \u201c declare war. \u201d Of all the toxic constitutional developments of the Obama years , by far the most disheartening is this : Obama \u2019 s unlawful intervention in Libya garnered strong criticism ; but the harshest criticism came when Obama chose to obey the Constitution by asking for congressional authorization to strike Syria . For breaking the mold of presidential unilateralism , he garnered\u2014and continues to garner\u2014the undisguised scorn not only of his political enemies but even of many of his friends . That hostile verdict on his presidential leadership is the clearest sign that we have entered what future historians may describe as a post-constitutional era .\nWhy , of all the many military misadventures into which Uncle Sam has blundered since 2001 , is Syria different ? The reason is that , under the Constitution and the War Powers Act , the president has no authority to send military forces into hostilities except after congressional authorization or in response to a direct attack on the U.S. or its forces . The president has no inherent power over war ; it is given to Congress . In 2001 , George W. Bush grumbled about his supposed executive authority , but went to Congress for approval of a \u201c war \u201d against \u201c those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 \u201d ; in 2002 , he did the same again , and got approval to \u201c defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq ; and \u2026 enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. \u201d Those resolutions remain , at least technically , in force , and have been used by the Obama and Trump administrations as justification for U.S. efforts on behalf of forces\u2014including some of the Syrian rebels\u2014fighting against the Islamic State , supposedly a \u201c successor \u201d to Al Qaeda .\nRepublicans in the congressional leadership insist that the 2001 authorization is all that \u2019 s needed . \u201c The existing AUMF gives him the authority he needs to do what he may or may not do , \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday . That plough really won \u2019 t scour , no matter how you torture the text . The nation of Syria is not the nation of Iraq ; and the Syrian government is not Al Qaeda , nor an affiliate , nor a successor , nor anything except a sovereign nation against which the president has decided to go to war .\nTrump must go to Congress to seek approval now ; and if he does not , Congress must , regardless , conduct a full debate on what he has done and whether he should be allowed to keep doing it and when he should stop . Trump is both incoherent and pathologically secretive . He is almost certainly unable and unwilling to tell the country what he is doing . If Congress does not debate the next step in Syria , there will simply never be any statement of U.S. war aims . Neither the Syrians , nor the Russians , nor any U.S. allies , nor the American public will have a clue what we are doing and when we have failed or succeeded .",
