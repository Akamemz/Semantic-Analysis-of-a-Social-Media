Week after week , Post reporters and editors cranked out investigatory pieces on the academic paper the Virginia GOP gubernatorial nominee penned back in 1989 , which touched on issues such as women in the workplace and same-sex marriage . Democrats piled on , making The Thesis a central element of their campaign . McDonnell ended up winning a blowout victory , despite the Post 's obsessive crusade . ( His subsequent public corruption conviction has been thrown out , and it was announced this week that he will not be retried ) . Today , the same publication that engineered flood-the-zone coverage of a decades-old masters thesis -- and that famously blew the lid off the red hot scoop that Rick Perry 's family had hunted at a ranch where a racially-inflammatory word was painted on a rock in the early 1980 's -- is scolding the media for focusing too much attention on Hillary Clinton 's email scandal .
