They also had high praise for Trump\u2014and while not an official endorsement , it is a positive outcome for Trump \u2019 s first and only meeting with Muslim world leaders thus far .\nEgyptian officials expressed frustration and outrage over the Obama administration \u2019 s support of the Muslim Brotherhood and expressed concern that a Clinton administration would continue to undermine Egyptian efforts to dismantle Brotherhood terrorists attempting to destabilize the democratically elected Egyptian government .\nAhmed Gad , a member of the Egyptian Parliament \u2019 s Foreign Relations Committee , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Tuesday night :\nI think 90 percent of Egyptians would prefer Trump because he will not cooperate with terrorists . He [ Trump ] will not cooperate with Muslim Brothers and our main concern in Egypt now is terrorist attacks as you saw two days ago in the United States . We saw it daily in Egypt on the hands of Muslim Brothers so we know very well that Muslim Brothers are a terrorist group and we want to build up our democratic regime .\nMany members of the Egyptian delegation spoke on the record exclusively with \u2588\u2588\u2588 at an event to promote communication and unity between the United States and Egypt on Tuesday night . The event was organized by popular Egyptian media personality and host of American Pulse Dr. Michael Morgan , and featured several American foreign policy experts including representatives from the London Center for Policy Research and more than a hundred prominent Egyptians including members of parliament , leading media figures , government officials , and businessmen .\nThe Egyptian delegation interviews came as El-Sisi , in an interview with CNN , said that he has \u201c no doubt \u201d that Donald Trump would make a strong leader . El-Sisi also responded to a clip of Hillary Clinton accusing the Egyptian government of being \u201c basically an army dictatorship , \u201d during a debate with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders . He said , in part , that \u201c in Egypt there will not be a chance for any dictatorship because in Egypt there is a constitution , there is law , and there is the will of the people which will refuse to allow any leader to stay in his position for any period longer than his term which is four years . \u201d\nThe fact that El-Sisi and those from the Egyptian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly here in New York City this week would speak so openly and positively about Trump\u2014and so openly and negatively about Clinton\u2014may surprise some . They are Muslim leaders and Egypt is perhaps one of the biggest and longest-standing Muslim nations in world history . Many establishment media outlets have painted Trump \u2019 s relationship with all Muslims as toxic , since he has expressed plans to temporarily ban Islamic migration into the United States . But El-Sisi , when asked about Trump \u2019 s proposed Muslim ban during his CNN interview , defended Trump .\n\u201c The United States in general conducts very strict security measures for everyone who wishes to visit it , which has been in place for quite a few years , \u201d El-Sisi , the first Muslim world leader to meet with Trump , told CNN . \u201c It \u2019 s also important to know that during election campaigns many statements are made and many things are said , however afterwards governing the country would be something different . And will be subject to many factors . \u201d\nEl-Sisi expressed these same sentiments in other interviews with the Egyptian delegation to the U.N.G.A . this week . At Trump \u2019 s meeting with El-Sisi , retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn\u2014the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) for two years during the Obama administration\u2014and U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-AL ) were also present .\nThe Trump campaign said in a readout of the meeting sent to press :\nMr. Trump thanked President el-Sisi and the Egyptian people for what they have done in defense of their country and for the betterment of the world over the last few years . He expressed great respect for Egypt \u2019 s history and the important leadership role it has played in the Middle East . Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt \u2019 s war on terrorism , and how under a Trump Administration , the United States of America will be a loyal friend , not simply an ally , that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead . Mr. Trump emphasized the strong partnership that the United States and Egypt have shared for so many years and how this relationship is vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East , broader region and the world . Mr. Trump also expressed his recognition of Egypt \u2019 s close relationship with Israel on countering terrorism.Mr . Trump highlighted how Egypt and the U.S. share a common enemy and the importance of working together in defeating radical Islamic terrorism , not only politically and militarily , but also addressing the ideology . Mr. Trump emphasized to President el-Sisi his high regard for peace-loving Muslims and understands that every day there are people of goodwill that sacrifice their lives and fortunes to combat the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism . Mr. Trump said that if he were fortunate enough to win the election in November , he would invite President el-Sisi on an official visit to the United States and would be honored to visit Egypt and the Egyptian people who he has a great fondness for .\nClinton \u2019 s campaign described her meeting with El-Sisi as being successful as well . According to a Clinton aide :\nSecretary Clinton and President Sisi had a constructive discussion about bilateral ties and cooperation on a wide range of issues , including counterterrorism . They also discussed the importance of economic development and investment in Egypt . Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt \u2019 s future progress . Secretary Clinton called for the release of U.S. citizen Aya Hijazi and raised concerns about prosecution of Egyptian human rights organizations and activists . Secretary Clinton discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation , particularly in the fight against ISIS . She and President Sisi exchanged views about the Middle East , and Secretary Clinton underscored the importance of the Egyptian cooperation with Israel on counterterrorism , and her commitment to defeating ISIS , to addressing foreign fighters , and to countering radicalization .\nHowever , the Egyptian delegations \u2019 respective statements to \u2588\u2588\u2588 do not reveal a positive aftermath for Clinton \u2019 s meeting .\nBut clearly , based upon El-Sisi \u2019 s interview with CNN and comments that the various members of the Egyptian delegation here made to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , it is Trump not Clinton whom the Egyptian leadership wants to win the election .\nThe Chief Executive Officer of the Egyptian Chamber of Media Industry , Amr Fathy , took issue with Hillary Clinton \u2019 s claims that President El-Sisi is a dictator . \u201c The signs you take as dictatorship is not dictatorship , \u201d Fathy told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Of El-Sisi , Fathy added : \u201c This is our president and we are behind him . \u201d\n\u201c The Egyptian authorities they have already dealt with Hillary before ; we did not deal with Trump , \u201d Fathy explained about the meetings between El-Sisi and the American presidential candidates . \u201c So , maybe we know now much more and better idea about Mr. Trump in specific . \u201d\nWhen asked about the coziness between Clinton and the Muslim Brotherhood , Fathy showed just how damaging the Obama foreign policy directed by Hillary Clinton and her successor at the State Department , John Kerry , has been to America \u2019 s standing in the eye \u2019 s of the Egyptians . He said :\nThey [ Muslim Brotherhood ] were supported by the Americans and the Western world . Why ? I don \u2019 t know . They did not come by democracy , they were not the people who came out on the 25th of January . They were not , the youth were the people who came out . We have our own identity , we are not a theocratic nation we have never been a theocratic nation . The American policy is always pushing for theocratic regimes and then when you have a theocratic regime you start crying .\nOne consistent theme among the Egyptians who spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 was the deep distrust of Hillary Clinton . Dr. Morgan said of Egyptian President El-Sisi \u2019 s meetings with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Monday :\nPresident El-Sisi wanted to meet up with both candidates because he did not want to give Hillary a chance to use and abuse an indirect endorsement from a meeting with a President like El-Sisi . As evil as she is , she was going to go out into the media and say , \u2018 oh I have a good relationship with this man , I know foreign policy \u2019 so he made sure that he would meet Trump as well to make sure the America public doesn \u2019 t think he supports Hillary . We know he would never support Hillary because Hillary is another eight years of Obama and Obama has been really bad for Egypt .\nThe members of the Egyptian Parliament that \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke with Tuesday night showcased the inclusive nature of the new Egyptian government under President El-Sisi . Among the representatives were two women , a Coptic Christian , and a 31-year-old man . One of the female Parliament members pointed out that a third of the Egyptian parliament members are under the age of 35 .\nOne of those women , Sahar Talaat Moustafa , is the head of the Tourism and Civil Aviation Committee . When asked by \u2588\u2588\u2588 how the Egyptian people see Hillary Clinton , she responded : \u201c A lot of people in Egypt feel she is in support of the Brotherhood . Actually , a majority of people think so . \u201d\nMoustafa invited Americans to come visit Egypt and see for themselves .\n\u201c I invite you to come and see how things are going on in Egypt , \u201d she said . \u201c Everything is so smooth we are walking normally in the streets and there is no terrorism . Egypt \u2019 s is one of the safest countries to go . \u201d\nAhmed Gad is a member of the Egyptian Parliament \u2019 s Foreign Policy Committee and he echoed the desire of the Egyptian dignitaries who spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 for a better relationship with the United States , but also concern that under the Obama administration the United States sided with the wrong side in the Muslim Brotherhood . Gad said :\nFor us , it \u2019 s a very important signal that we want to resume our good relations but in the same time , I am speaking as a political researcher , frankly speaking , we are very disappointed from Obama \u2019 s policy towards our country . Because , by the way , I am a Coptic in Egypt so we suffered a lot under the Muslim Brotherhood regime . Some sort of cooperation between the American administration , Obama Administration , and the Muslim Brothers . We know very well that they are terrorists , they burned and destroyed over 100 churches in Egypt , and they killed a lot of Christians . They killed and are still killing a lot of Egyptians priests men and soldiers . At the same time the Obama administration is refusing to deal with the Muslim Brothers as a terrorist group .\nGad said that El-Sisi \u2019 s background as a general should not be taken to mean he is somehow running a \u201c military dictatorship \u201d as Hillary Clinton claimed .\n\u201c Yes , El-Sisi has a military background but he saved Egypt , \u201d Gad said . \u201c He restored the Egyptian identity . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s why they seem to really want Trump elected in the United States .\nSome of the members of the Egyptian Parliament did express concern that Donald Trump might have trouble restoring the relationship with Egypt because of the institutional nature of the American system of government and foreign policy . Many of the American foreign policy experts explained that the American President sets foreign policy and that a President Trump would have the authority to change the diplomatic course between the two nations .\n\u201c That \u2019 s why we are ready to cooperate with anybody who can fight the Muslim Brothers and frankly speaking , we are fighting terrorism on behalf of the Modern World , \u201d Gad said .",
