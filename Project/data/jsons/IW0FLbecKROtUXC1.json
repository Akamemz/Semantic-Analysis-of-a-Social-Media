    "content": "From The New York Times , I \u2019 m Michael Barbaro . This is \u201c The Daily. \u201d Today \u2014 at the heart of the impeachment inquiry was a threat to withhold U.S. military assistance from Ukraine . Why that assistance had been so important to Ukraine , and to the United States , in the first place . It \u2019 s Monday , November 11 .\nThe word \u201c Ukraine \u201d means frontier or border land . This was a frontier between two competing empires . It \u2019 s been a country torn between East and West , between Western Europe and Russia .\nFor most of the 20th century , Russia had won out , and Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union .\narchived recording The Declaration of Independence is on , as of today ? That \u2019 s what it says . From the moment \u2014 It is effective as of today .\nUntil August 24 , 1991 , when Ukraine took a step toward the West .\narchived recording Good . An already emotional week ended today , as the people of the Ukraine embarked on a new beginning , becoming the fifth republic to break away from the Kremlin .\nIt was the culmination of a long struggle for independence . And after years of hardship under Soviet rule , Ukraine was now an independent state .\narchived recording This is one of the turning points in history . The vote for independence of the Ukraine is , in fact , one of those momentous events that is going to change the rest of history . It \u2019 s the end of the Russian Empire .\nSo once Ukraine becomes an independent country , and it can have its own international relations with the rest of the world , what do those relationships start to look like ?\nThe key issue for Ukraine that defined both its foreign and its domestic policy in the post-Soviet period was the geopolitical struggle for Ukraine \u2019 s allegiance .\nI reached Andrew Kramer , a foreign correspondent for The Times in Kiev .\nOn the one hand you had Ukraine , very closely tied to Russia by industrial supply chains , by energy pipelines , and indeed by culture and by history . But the European Union was pulling Ukraine in a Western direction , the European Union in the United States , trying to conceive of Ukraine as integrated into the Western European world . And as Europe pulled in one direction , Russia started to pull back .\nAnd what was it about Ukraine that interested the U.S. and the European Union ?\nThe idea was to encourage the development of a Democratic system , and to prevent the re-emergence of a Russian empire . There was the axiom that Russia without Ukraine is just a country , and Russia with Ukraine becomes an empire . So maintaining the independence of Ukraine was a policy objective to prevent the re-emergence of an expansionist imperial power in Moscow .\nIt feels like at this point , the Cold War is officially over . But it \u2019 s not quite over .\nThat \u2019 s right . There was a feeling that the Russians , although they had acquiesced to the independence of these countries , they had a phantom limb syndrome . They always felt that Ukraine , in fact , should belong to Russia .\nPhantom limb as if they could never really believe that Ukraine or Czechoslovakia or any of these countries were not really theirs anymore .\nYes , that \u2019 s right . And there \u2019 s something more . There \u2019 s a cultural issue at play here . Both Russia and Ukraine trace their origin to Kiev . Kiev was the capital of the original Russian state . They feel this was the roots of their country , and they don \u2019 t want to see it in another state . So they feel that the Ukrainians are something like wayward cousins in this sense , that it should be obvious to Ukrainians that this is all one culture and one civilization .\nSo Russians believe that Russia , as a concept , as a place , as a country , as an identity began in Kiev .\nBut of course the fact that Ukraine is independent means that no matter how Russia feels about it , Ukraine has the right to develop whatever relationship it wants with the U.S. and with the European Union .\nTheoretically , certainly , but they also have to be very cautious about not poking the Russian bear . That they have a powerful neighbor and they have to acknowledge the real politics of their circumstances . What \u2019 s developing here is the tug of war that becomes the story of post-independence Ukraine , with the West reaching out to form alliances , and Russia seeking to maintain its sphere of influence in Ukraine .\narchived recording Ukraine is trying to decide whether it wants to align itself with Russia \u2019 s regional trade bloc or to push for E.U integration .\nThis really came to a head with two competing trade agreements , which were offered to Ukraine .\narchived recording The Ukrainian president arrived in Strasbourg , poised to work on concluding the association agreement \u2014\narchived recording \u2014 with a view to later establishing a free trade area between Ukraine and the E.U .\nThe European Union offered a more serious and formal trade arrangement with Ukraine that would be , possibly a path to membership in the E.U. , although that was seen as a distant prospect .\narchived recording After 15 years of eager anticipation , the Customs Union between Russia , Belarus and Kazakhstan is up and running .\nAnd Russia responded by offering a trade agreement of its own , which was called the Customs Union .\narchived recording The union , created to ease mutual trade , could be joined by another candidate , Ukraine .\nWhich was very similar on paper to the European Union , but it was also , in a sense , a reforming of the Soviet Union as well .\narchived recording The country is at a crossroads , deciding whether to turn East or West .\nThis feels like a very consequential moment . Because to join the E.U would feel like Ukraine saying , officially we see ourselves as part of Europe . To choose a trade deal instead with Russia would be to say to the West , we ultimately see ourselves as part of the world of Russia .\nThat \u2019 s right . So while on paper this was about trade , grain quotas , and so forth , this was really about the destiny of the country .\nAnd where does the Ukrainian leader at the time fall on this decision , the West or Russia ?\nThe Ukrainian leader , Viktor Yanukovych , had generally been seen as a pro-Russian politician . But he had promised that Ukraine would integrate economically with the European Union , while maintaining good relations with Russia .\nBut in the end , in a very dramatic moment \u2014\n\u2014 the Yanukovych government announces that they will turn to Russia instead of the European Union for a trade agreement .\nThat was genuinely surprising to me . I mean , here is this country just a couple of decades out of independence , and it is taking the most formal step possible to reintegrate itself with the country it had sought independence from .\nThat \u2019 s right . And this is what a lot of people in Ukraine and in Kiev felt about this decision .\narchived recording [ CHANTS IN UKRAINIAN ] There were immediate protests in Kiev that never let up from the day they began in November of 2013 . [ SPEAKING TO A CROWD IN UKRAINIAN ]\nWell , when I came down to cover these protests in the late fall of 2013 , there was already a tent encampment in the center of Kiev , in Independence Square , with thousands and thousands of people on the square , around the clock .\nPeople were genuinely outraged by this decision to lean back towards Russia .\nAnd it was also something of a party , really . Even though they were always riot policemen \u2014 some where hovering on the edges of these protests , sometimes making incursions , making arrests , there were also groups called \u201c titushky , \u201d which were hired thugs who would come in with a lead pipe or knives , straight razors , and would be attacking the protesters . It started to turn more violent as the winter came on . By February , I was living in a hotel , right on the square , and it became very tense . When I drove into the city in the early morning , I could see black smoke rising from the center of Kiev from burning cars . And there were a number of very violent confrontations over about two days in late February , in which the police eventually encroached on the square , overran much of the territory that the protesters had controlled , and pushed it back to a few hundred square yards . And at the last moment , the protesters , out of desperation , they started to burn tires and actually anything that was flammable to make a ring around this small , charred bit of pavement that was the only remaining area that they controlled , that they sort of felt this was what was left of their dream of the independent Ukraine . And then in the final day \u2014\narchived recording [ GUNSHOT ] And there were snipers firing into the crowd . Over this hour and a half , 70 people were killed , and several hundred people were wounded . It was such a brutal moment that the Ukrainian elite and the international community realized that something had happened that could not be left unaddressed . And there was a revolt in the Yanukovych government against the president . And the police defected \u2014\n\u2014 and betrayed their president , and actually left the city center . And within hours , the president fled the capital .\nWell , what happened next was a move by Russia . Because Russia and President Vladimir Putin had just lost its ally in Viktor Yanukovych . And the very next day Putin met with his security chiefs overnight . And by dawn , President Putin orders what he calls an operation to take back Crimea , which is in the south of Ukraine . And what this was really was an order of a military intervention into Ukraine .\narchived recording Russia is tightening its grip on Crimea , as we get reports of an increasing number of troops and takeovers of key military facilities . This despite intense diplomatic efforts \u2014\nWhat is it about Crimea that makes it the most logical place for Putin to try to invade ?\nWell , Crimea is host to a major Russian naval base in Sevastopol . So the military infrastructure is partly already in place . Also , the population in Crimea is predominantly Russian-speaking . So you would have a receptive population in this area .\narchived recording Look at Ukraine and Crimea , down in the south there , jutting out into the waters of the Black Sea , home to a critical port the Russian navy has used for centuries . This morning , more unidentified pro-Russian armed militias , patrolling the streets of Crimea \u2019 s capital .\nSo this was an unacknowledged intervention . These were men who had no insignia on their uniforms . They were called , disparagingly by the Ukrainians , \u201c the little green men , \u201d as if they \u2019 d come from space . Mystery men in green uniforms by the hundreds were showing up in their country .\narchived recording Vladimir Putin , proudly watching Russian military exercises today .\narchived recording His army controls the roads , borders , and military bases .\nThey overran the local legislature and other centers of power , and really , within days , had seized control .\nSo by this point the political process starts . The de facto authorities declare a referendum . There are no observers , so it \u2019 s hard to say exactly what happened . But the people are asked , do you want to join Russia or would you like to remain in Ukraine ? And by this point , of course , they are , in fact , already part of Russia . And the results come in , and a majority want to be annexed by Russia .\nSo Russia , having invaded Crimea , then asks the people of Crimea , do you , basically mind that we just invaded Crimea ? And it turns out that the answer is no .\nIs it fair to say that Russia was using this kind of vote as a rationale to say , it \u2019 s OK that we just annexed Crimea , because in a sense , Crimea was always ours ?\nYes , absolutely . The message was , these are our people , and they \u2019 re coming home .\nSo we left off back in Kiev with Ukraine losing its leader . So what is the response in Ukraine to this military incursion by Russia ? What happened next was , Russia tried a similar approach in other provinces .\narchived recording Just yesterday , at this hour , thousands of Russian troops have been deployed to Ukraine \u2019 s border .\nThey \u2019 ve fomented uprisings in Russian-speaking areas . And this led to the war that we have going on in Ukraine today between pro-Russian forces and pro-Ukrainian forces .\nIt \u2019 s been a forgotten war . While there was interest in the first months , it \u2019 s settled into a stalemate .\nThere was debate in the Obama administration about how to respond .\narchived recording ( barack obama ) I wanted to provide a brief update on our efforts to address the ongoing crisis in Ukraine .\nAnd they settled on what they were calling non-lethal assistance .\narchived recording ( barack obama ) \u2014 to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian government , so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy .\nAnd this was training for the Ukrainian army , ambulances , armored vehicles , body armor , radios , and other types of assistance , which were not deemed to be lethal , or most importantly , would not provoke a retaliatory escalation from Russia .\narchived recording It \u2019 s time to ask the hard question . Are we willing to stand up to Vladimir Putin \u2019 s aggression before he kills more people , does more economic damage , further destabilizes Europe ?\nSupport for Ukraine in Congress had been bipartisan . Both parties had agreed that backing Ukrainian independence was really in the United State \u2019 s interests . This was about holding Russia at bay . There hadn \u2019 t been much controversy over that .\narchived recording That \u2019 s why I \u2019 m announcing today my plan to introduce new legislation . It will offer Ukraine greater assistance on a variety of fronts .\nAnd this assistance was rolled over in Congress year after year .\nRight . And so this is the military assistance that we have now heard so much about over the past few weeks .\narchived recording ( john mccain ) Give them the weapons they need . Give them the wherewithal they need . Give them the ability to fight . They will fight . archived recording The world is watching , and the world \u2019 s superpower can not be seen as incapable of rising to Russia \u2019 s challenge .\nOK . So this is the situation after 2014 . So what happens to this relationship once President Trump takes office ?\nFrom the Ukrainian side , there was an effort to strike up a transactional relationship with President Trump , as sort of , you scratch my back , I \u2019 ll scratch yours . President Poroshenko and president of Ukraine at the time negotiated , for example , to buy coal from Pennsylvania . This was politically beneficial for Trump , because Pennsylvania coal miners were really Trump \u2019 s base , and Trump had promised to deliver jobs to coal miners in his campaign .\narchived recording That \u2019 s a great honor and a great pleasure to be together with you , with the president , one of the most reliable , supportive , and partner \u2014 strategic partner for Ukraine . We really try to bring freedom and democracy .\nSo the Ukrainian government is desperate to do whatever it needs to do to get into Trump \u2019 s good graces , because in their minds , if they can do that , they can restore a better relationship with the U.S. , and one in which the U.S. sees Ukraine as a strategic partner , and leans away from Russia .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) Thank you very much . It \u2019 s wonderful to have President Poroshenko with us . We spent some time recently in the White House . And I know you \u2019 ve made good progress since then \u2014 a lot of progress , actually . And I wouldn \u2019 t say it \u2019 s the easiest place right now to live , but you \u2019 re making it better and better on a daily basis . And I do hear very , very good things .\nHow is President Trump weighing in on this war , waging within the Ukraine between these pro-Russian forces and Ukrainian military ?\narchived recording ( donald trump ) And I really hope that Russia \u2014 because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something \u2014 I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem . That would be a tremendous achievement . And I know you \u2019 re trying to do that .\narchived recording Silence in the White House , which is pretty distressing , given that we clearly have a powder keg . So will President Trump really put pressure on Vladimir Putin over this latest clash between Russia and Ukraine ? Well we pressed the Trump administration repeatedly on that question . Neither the White House nor the State Department would comment .\nAnd amid all this uncertainty about whether the Trump administration is really supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia , the Ukrainians learned , by early August of this year , that about $ 400 million in military aid has been held up by the White House .\narchived recording Hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid has poured into Ukraine since 2014 . But that could be at risk . Critics say the potential aid cut is an example of Trump capitulating to Russia . Some members of Congress are already sounding the alarm .\nAnd this was the time when they needed U.S. backing . And the aid was a symbol of U.S. backing . It was also quite valuable for their military . But it wasn \u2019 t quite clear initially what the issue was , or how serious it would become . There was a creeping awareness in Ukrainian government that the aid might , in fact , be lost by September .\nFinally , Andrew , the reason we \u2019 re talking to you about this military aid at all is , of course , the phone call that President Trump makes to Ukraine \u2019 s president , and everything that we have learned since about the withholding of that aid to Ukraine , unless the Ukrainians agreed to do these investigations that President Trump wanted into his rivals . And based on what you \u2019 ve told us , how critically important this aide is , I guess I \u2019 m curious what the people fighting the war in Ukraine on the ground , who rely on this military aid , what they make of this series of events .\nUltimately , when I talked to dozens of soldiers , the feeling was one of disappointment . They felt they had maybe lost an ally in this war . I was at the front in October and met with some soldiers , and they naturally said that they were disappointed . The Ukrainian army is a poor army . They \u2019 re fighting with basic weapons \u2014 Kalashnikov rifles , binoculars . They \u2019 re living in dug out bunkers . Some of the soldiers , for example , are wearing tennis shoes and not boots . It \u2019 s a very grim existence . So for them to learn they were losing the military assistance was quite a blow . Soldiers said they were disappointed . So this was really a shock to soldiers to realize that they might be in this on their own .\nThis week , the first witness to be called in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will be Bill Taylor , the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine , who is expected to testify that he had a , quote , \u201c Clear understanding that American military aid to Ukraine would not be released until the Ukrainians pursued investigations that would benefit President Trump. \u201d In his closed door testimony , Taylor has described a quote snake pit of people around the president , who were willing to use the military aid as leverage over Ukraine , despite the danger it posed to Ukraine . We \u2019 ll be right back . Here is what else you need to know today .\narchived recording So is this a sign that Republicans are prepared to go back on the offense here ? I think it is , and first of all \u2014\nOver the weekend , House Republicans released their list of witnesses for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry , including Joe Biden \u2019 s son , Hunter , Hunter Biden \u2019 s business partner , and the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint launched the inquiry .\narchived recording I \u2019 m excited to see some of these witnesses that we \u2019 ve placed on the list . It \u2019 s finally \u2014 finally we have an opportunity to kind of get to the bottom of what \u2019 s going on , and to round out some of the evidence . Heretofore , as you know , it \u2019 s been a very one-sided sham of a process .\nThe witness list appeared to be an attempt by Republicans to shift the focus of the investigation away from President Trump .\narchived recording Let \u2019 s hope that Chairman Schiff will allow these witnesses to testify .",

Mystery men in green uniforms by the hundreds were showing up in their country.\n\narchived recording Vladimir Putin, proudly watching Russian military exercises today.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nThey surrounded Ukrainian military bases.\n\narchived recording His Air Force controls the sky.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nThey seized a bunch of the Ukrainian navy.\n\narchived recording His army controls the roads, borders, and military bases.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nThey overran the local legislature and other centers of power, and really, within days, had seized control.\n\narchived recording Putin rules in Crimea now.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nSo by this point the political process starts. The de facto authorities declare a referendum. There are no observers, so it\u2019s hard to say exactly what happened. But the people are asked, do you want to join Russia or would you like to remain in Ukraine? And by this point, of course, they are, in fact, already part of Russia. And the results come in, and a majority want to be annexed by Russia.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Russia, having invaded Crimea, then asks the people of Crimea, do you, basically mind that we just invaded Crimea? And it turns out that the answer is no.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nExactly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs it fair to say that Russia was using this kind of vote as a rationale to say, it\u2019s OK that we just annexed Crimea, because in a sense, Crimea was always ours?\n\nandrew kramer\n\nYes, absolutely. The message was, these are our people, and they\u2019re coming home.\n\narchived recording [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN]\n\nandrew kramer\n\nSo we left off back in Kiev with Ukraine losing its leader. So what is the response in Ukraine to this military incursion by Russia? What happened next was, Russia tried a similar approach in other provinces.\n\narchived recording Just yesterday, at this hour, thousands of Russian troops have been deployed to Ukraine\u2019s border.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nThey\u2019ve fomented uprisings in Russian-speaking areas. And this led to the war that we have going on in Ukraine today between pro-Russian forces and pro-Ukrainian forces.\n\narchived recording [GUNFIRE]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does this war look like?\n\narchived recording [SPEAKING UKRAINIAN] [EXPLOSION]\n\nandrew kramer\n\nIt\u2019s been a forgotten war. While there was interest in the first months, it\u2019s settled into a stalemate.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) Good afternoon, everybody.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nThere was debate in the Obama administration about how to respond.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) I wanted to provide a brief update on our efforts to address the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nAnd they settled on what they were calling non-lethal assistance.\n\narchived recording (barack obama) \u2014 to provide American assistance for the Ukrainian government, so that they can weather this storm and stabilize their economy.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nAnd this was training for the Ukrainian army, ambulances, armored vehicles, body armor, radios, and other types of assistance, which were not deemed to be lethal, or most importantly, would not provoke a retaliatory escalation from Russia.\n\narchived recording It\u2019s time to ask the hard question. Are we willing to stand up to Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression before he kills more people, does more economic damage, further destabilizes Europe?\n\nandrew kramer\n\nSo this began in 2014.\n\narchived recording Our options grow fewer and less effective.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nSupport for Ukraine in Congress had been bipartisan. Both parties had agreed that backing Ukrainian independence was really in the United State\u2019s interests. This was about holding Russia at bay. There hadn\u2019t been much controversy over that.\n\narchived recording That\u2019s why I\u2019m announcing today my plan to introduce new legislation. It will offer Ukraine greater assistance on a variety of fronts.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nAnd this assistance was rolled over in Congress year after year.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And so this is the military assistance that we have now heard so much about over the past few weeks.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (john mccain) Give them the weapons they need. Give them the wherewithal they need. Give them the ability to fight. They will fight. archived recording The world is watching, and the world\u2019s superpower can not be seen as incapable of rising to Russia\u2019s challenge.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So this is the situation after 2014. So what happens to this relationship once President Trump takes office?\n\nandrew kramer\n\nFrom the Ukrainian side, there was an effort to strike up a transactional relationship with President Trump, as sort of, you scratch my back, I\u2019ll scratch yours. President Poroshenko and president of Ukraine at the time negotiated, for example, to buy coal from Pennsylvania. This was politically beneficial for Trump, because Pennsylvania coal miners were really Trump\u2019s base, and Trump had promised to deliver jobs to coal miners in his campaign.\n\narchived recording That\u2019s a great honor and a great pleasure to be together with you, with the president, one of the most reliable, supportive, and partner \u2014 strategic partner for Ukraine. We really try to bring freedom and democracy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the Ukrainian government is desperate to do whatever it needs to do to get into Trump\u2019s good graces, because in their minds, if they can do that, they can restore a better relationship with the U.S., and one in which the U.S. sees Ukraine as a strategic partner, and leans away from Russia.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It\u2019s wonderful to have President Poroshenko with us. We spent some time recently in the White House. And I know you\u2019ve made good progress since then \u2014 a lot of progress, actually. And I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the easiest place right now to live, but you\u2019re making it better and better on a daily basis . And I do hear very, very good things.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow is President Trump weighing in on this war, waging within the Ukraine between these pro-Russian forces and Ukrainian military?\n\narchived recording (donald trump) And I really hope that Russia \u2014 because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something \u2014 I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem. That would be a tremendous achievement. And I know you\u2019re trying to do that.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nHe\u2019s been very quiet on Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.\n\narchived recording Silence in the White House, which is pretty distressing, given that we clearly have a powder keg. So will President Trump really put pressure on Vladimir Putin over this latest clash between Russia and Ukraine? Well we pressed the Trump administration repeatedly on that question. Neither the White House nor the State Department would comment.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nAnd amid all this uncertainty about whether the Trump administration is really supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, the Ukrainians learned, by early August of this year, that about $400 million in military aid has been held up by the White House.\n\narchived recording Hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid has poured into Ukraine since 2014. But that could be at risk. Critics say the potential aid cut is an example of Trump capitulating to Russia. Some members of Congress are already sounding the alarm.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nAnd this was the time when they needed U.S. backing. And the aid was a symbol of U.S. backing. It was also quite valuable for their military. But it wasn\u2019t quite clear initially what the issue was, or how serious it would become. There was a creeping awareness in Ukrainian government that the aid might, in fact, be lost by September.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinally, Andrew, the reason we\u2019re talking to you about this military aid at all is, of course, the phone call that President Trump makes to Ukraine\u2019s president, and everything that we have learned since about the withholding of that aid to Ukraine, unless the Ukrainians agreed to do these investigations that President Trump wanted into his rivals. And based on what you\u2019ve told us, how critically important this aide is, I guess I\u2019m curious what the people fighting the war in Ukraine on the ground, who rely on this military aid, what they make of this series of events.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nUltimately, when I talked to dozens of soldiers, the feeling was one of disappointment. They felt they had maybe lost an ally in this war. I was at the front in October and met with some soldiers, and they naturally said that they were disappointed. The Ukrainian army is a poor army. They\u2019re fighting with basic weapons \u2014 Kalashnikov rifles, binoculars. They\u2019re living in dug out bunkers. Some of the soldiers, for example, are wearing tennis shoes and not boots. It\u2019s a very grim existence. So for them to learn they were losing the military assistance was quite a blow. Soldiers said they were disappointed. So this was really a shock to soldiers to realize that they might be in this on their own.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAndrew, thank you very much.\n\nandrew kramer\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis week, the first witness to be called in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry will be Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who is expected to testify that he had a, quote, \u201cClear understanding that American military aid to Ukraine would not be released until the Ukrainians pursued investigations that would benefit President Trump.\u201d In his closed door testimony, Taylor has described a quote snake pit of people around the president, who were willing to use the military aid as leverage over Ukraine, despite the danger it posed to Ukraine. We\u2019ll be right back. Here is what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording So is this a sign that Republicans are prepared to go back on the offense here? I think it is, and first of all \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOver the weekend, House Republicans released their list of witnesses for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry, including Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner, and the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint launched the inquiry.\n\narchived recording I\u2019m excited to see some of these witnesses that we\u2019ve placed on the list. It\u2019s finally \u2014 finally we have an opportunity to kind of get to the bottom of what\u2019s going on, and to round out some of the evidence. Heretofore, as you know, it\u2019s been a very one-sided sham of a process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe witness list appeared to be an attempt by Republicans to shift the focus of the investigation away from President Trump.\n\narchived recording Let\u2019s hope that Chairman Schiff will allow these witnesses to testify.\n\nmichael barbaro",
