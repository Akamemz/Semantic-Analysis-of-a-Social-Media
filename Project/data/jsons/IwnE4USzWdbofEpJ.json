    "content": "A `` breach of protocol '' at the hospital where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan was treated before his death led to the infection of a healthcare worker with the deadly virus , and other caregivers could potentially be exposed , federal health officials said Sunday.The hospital worker , a woman who was not identified by officials , wore protective gear while treating the Liberian patient , and she has been unable to point to how the breach might have occurred , said Dr. Tom Frieden , head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Duncan was the first person in the U.S. diagnosed with Ebola .\nThe CDC confirmed Sunday afternoon that the woman had tested positive for Ebola \u2014 the first known case of the disease being contracted or transmitted in the U.S .\nThe missteps with the first patient and now the infection of a caregiver raised questions about assurances given by U.S. health officials that any American hospital should be able to treat an Ebola patient and that the disease would be contained .\nAt a briefing in Atlanta , Frieden said that at some point during Duncan 's treatment , `` there was a breach in protocol , and that breach in protocol resulted in this infection .
