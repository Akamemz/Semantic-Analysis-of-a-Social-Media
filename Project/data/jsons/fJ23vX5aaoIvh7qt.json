    "content": "Last weekend , Nicole Kushner Meyer stood on stage before a room of Chinese investors at the Ritz Carlton in Beijing and explained that her family \u2019 s new 79-story apartment building in Jersey City , New Jersey , overlooking Manhattan , \u201c means a lot to me and my family. \u201d Family is , indeed , sacrosanct to the Kushners . The clan was reared in Livingston , about a half an hour \u2019 s drive from the site of the project at hand . In his previous life as a real-estate scion , Meyer \u2019 s brother , Jared Kushner , the senior adviser and son-in-law to president Donald Trump , often spent weekends with his own burgeoning family , including fellow White House employee and First Daughter Ivanka Trump , near his parents \u2019 weekend estate . And , as is well known , Kushner regularly visited his father on weekends when he was serving a 14-month sentence in a federal prison in Alabama on 18 counts of tax evasion , witness tampering , and making illegal campaign donations\u2014a formative experience that seems to have forged a bond and ambition within the young man .\nBut family wasn \u2019 t the only thing apparently on Meyer \u2019 s mind as she presented her pitch to investors . She was seeking $ 150 million in financing , partly through a program that gives foreigners who invest at least half a million dollars in American development projects a pathway toward permanent residency and eventual citizenship\u2014a perfectly legal measure that Trump had extended a few days earlier when he signed the most recent budget bill . Meyer made a similar entreaty the next day at the Four Seasons in Shanghai , despite the flurry of ethics concerns that started to engulf the trip as reporters from The New York Times and a number of other news outlets telegraphed back that she had mentioned the elephant in the room : that her brother had left her family \u2019 s real-estate company to join the White House . ( Kushner stepped away from Kushner Companies in January and divested many of his real-estate holdings , keeping others in a family-held trust in order to comply with government ethics standards , and his lawyer has said he would recuse himself from related policy issues . )\nThis reality was presumably known to everyone in the room , but Meyer \u2019 s conflation couldn \u2019 t help but come across as a suggestion of potential influence peddling , real or otherwise .
