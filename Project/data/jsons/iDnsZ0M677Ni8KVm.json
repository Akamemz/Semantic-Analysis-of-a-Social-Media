    "content": "The bad news just keeps coming for conservative talker Rush Limbaugh .\nWhich bulletin was worse , though ? The news in April that he was being dropped by WIBC in Indianapolis , a booming talk powerhouse that played home to Limbaugh 's radio show for more than two decades , or the news this week that the talker 's new address on the Indianapolis dial is going to be WNDE , a ratings doormat AM sports station that has so few listeners it trails the commercial-free classical music outlet in town ?\nThe humbling , red-state tumble is just the latest setback for the conservative talker who has seen his once-golden career suffer a steady series of losses recently .\nDivorced from successful , longtime affiliates in places like New York , Los Angeles , Boston , and Indianapolis , Limbaugh 's professional trajectory is heading downward . That 's confirmed by the second and third-tier stations he now calls home in those important media markets , and the fact that when his show became available , general managers up and down the dial passed on it . Apparently turned off by the show 's hefty price tag , sagging ratings , and disappearing advertisers , Limbaugh continues to be a very hard sell .\nIt 's a precipitous fall from the glory days when the host posted huge ratings numbers , had affiliates clamoring to join his network , and dictated Republican politics . All of that seems increasingly distant now . With his comically inflated , $ 50 million-a-year syndication deal set to expire next year , Limbaugh 's future seems uncertain . `` Who would even want someone whose audience is aging and is considered toxic to many advertisers , '' askedRadioInsight last month .\nFor Limbaugh , the troubles were marked by key events from 2012 and 2013 . The first came in the form of Limbaugh 's Sandra Fluke implosion , where he castigated and insulted for days the graduate student who testified before Congress about health care and access to contraception , calling her a `` slut '' and suggesting she post videos of herself having sex on the Internet . The astonishing monologues sparked an unprecedented advertiser exodus .\nThe following year , as the host struggled to hang on to fleeing sponsors , radio industry giant Cumulus Media decided to negotiate its Limbaugh contract in public , making it clear through the press that the company was willing to cut ties with the pricey host in major cities where Cumulus owned talk radio stations . In the end , Limbaugh stayed with Cumulus stations , but the company sent a clear signal to the industry : Limbaugh was no longer an untouchable and general managers were n't clamoring to hire him . Since then , the talker 's fortunes have only faded .\nAnother looming problem ? Conservative talk radio is a `` format fewer advertisers are interested in buying because of its aging audience , '' noted radio consultant and self-identified Republican Darryl Parks . Limbaugh himself recently conceded a generational disconnect : `` Now that I 've outgrown the 25-54 demographic , I 'm no longer confident that the way I see the world is the way everybody else does .

Once a mighty player whose ring wasconstantly kissed by Republicans , this campaign season seems to be unfolding with Limbaugh on the sidelines , his clout and his ability to drive the conversation seemingly surpassed by other conservative mediaplayers .\nHere 's a perfect example . In April , Bloomberg 's Mark Halperin conducted an awkward interview with Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz , asking the Hispanic candidate about Cuban food and if he 'd answer at least one question in Spanish . Limbaugh immediately castigated Halperin 's Q & A on his show , but nobody seemed to pay much attention to his complaints .\nFast-forward one week and syndicated conservative columnist Ruben Navarrette lodged similar complaints about the interview . ( i.e . `` This was bad journalism , bad form , and bad manners .

But it had n't gone unnoticed . Limbaugh highlighted the interview right away . It 's just that nobody cared about the talker 's critique at the time .\nLimbaugh 's unfolding major-market woes will do little to boost his faltering influence .
