    "content": "With the day-long attempt by Democrats to `` hold the floor '' of the Senate to delay and disrupt the planned confirmation for the next secretary of education mostly in the rearview mirror , it now seems likely that President Trump 's controversial nominee , Betsy DeVos , will squeak by on a 50-50 vote . ( Vice President Mike Pence , who presides over the Senate , will get to cast the deciding vote after two GOP senators said they will vote no . )\nThere are two basic charges against DeVos , and one is more serious than the other .\nThe less serious , though mostly accurate , one is that she is plainly inexperienced . Like Trump entering the Oval Office , she has never overseen a public office or department , much less than one with nearly 5,000 employees . The Department of Education , founded only in 1979 , is the smallest of all cabinet agencies in terms of personnel and budget ( `` just '' $ 73 billion in 2016 ) . This is to say it 's a minor cabinet office that was so unnecessary the coutry somehow got by without one until the waning years of the Jimmy Carter presidency ( in 1980 , Ronald Reagan said he would abolish it if he won ; instead he just massively increased its budget ) . DeVos is a billionaire through marriage , to Dick DeVos , the heir to the Amway fortune , and while she invests in a wide range of more or less interesting businesses ( including Neurocore , which is trying to use biofeedback to cure depression and other ailments ) , she does n't rise to the level of , say , Carly Fiorina in terms of business chops . Similarly , she has never worked at or run a school or district , leaving her devoid of direct experience with education other than as a student and a parent ( which is n't nothing , exactly , but still not much ) .\nSo that first point is taken : She is inexperienced in running the sort of shop she 's about to take over . But then again , if she 's a competent administrator , that 's really what the job demands . As education analysts such as University of Arkansas ' Jay P. Greene and \u2588\u2588\u2588 Foundation 's Lisa Snell have told me , the education secretary has relatively little to do , as most federal funds are pre-committed through funding formulas that are difficult to monkey with very much . What the secretary can do is set a broad agenda and a tone . And that , not her lack of credentials , is why Democratic senators tried to `` hold the floor '' against her . DeVos has been very involved in Republican politics at the national and state levels , where she chaired the Michigan Republican Party and has supported all sorts of school-choice plans .\nGiven that , Senate Democrats and teachers unions are dead-set against her . The DeVos vote is n't ultimately about whether or not a Detroit billionaire runs a program that accounts for only 10 percent of K-12 spending around the country . ( The federal government 's influence is magnified by the conditions and rules it attaches to schools that receive any federal money . ) It 's about DeVos 's outspoken support for both the general idea of publicly financed school choice and specific plans . Here , for instance , is Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden , tweeting his disapproval :\nMaking it loud & clear outside the U.S. Capitol today : # NoOnDeVos .

From a libertarian perspective , that may or may not be a good idea ( I know I like the concept of separating the state from education very much ; how do you raise truly independent thinkers otherwise ? ) , but nothing like that is on the table . If you argue that `` privatization '' of public education happens when , say , K-12 students get taxpayer-financed money to go to private schools , your outrage would be better directed to the college-level Pell , student loan , and other financial aid programs that spend $ 130 billion a year , much of it going to private schools with religious affiliations .\nBeyond improperly invoking privatization , Wyden 's critique somehow presumes that not privatizing public education\u2014that is , maintaining the status quo\u2014will in fact `` give every child the chance to succeed .

But of course that 's not the case . In terms of total expenditures measured in constant dollars , we are spending about more than twice as much per pupil now as we were in the early 1970s ( $ 6,253 vs. $ 13,142 ) . And there 's no question that `` chances to succeed '' are distributed unequally throughout the public school system , with better odds closely tracking the children of wealthier , more-educated parents who attend schools that are more responsive to student needs .\nTo the extent that lower odds of succeeding are concentrated in poorer , urban districts , the very best fix is to introduce all sorts of programs that give students and parents more choices ( and let 's be clear : Publicly funded charter schools and voucher programs come with oversight , not least of which is that parents can take their kids and the tuition dollars elsewhere ; try doing that when you can only attend a school based on your street address ) . As Arkansas ' Greene has written , it 's true that on average charter schools have a similar academic-performance profile to public schools . But once you start doing apples-to-apples comparisons to students attending charters and public schools ( randomized-control trials or RCTs ) , something very clear presents itself :\nI 'm sure that most of the Senate Democrats opposing Betsy DeVos think they are opposing an inexperienced billionaire whose secret dream is to loot public school coffers for\u2026what , exactly ? Some sort of bizarre right-wing agenda , I suppose .

A recent poll found that 68 percent of Americans favor expanding school choice , including 55 percent of self-described Democrats , 75 percent among Latinos , 75 percent among millennials , and 72 percent among blacks .
