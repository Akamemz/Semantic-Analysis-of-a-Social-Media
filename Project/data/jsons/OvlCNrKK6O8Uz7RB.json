He 's leading in Iowa . It looks like he 's in a dead heat in New Hampshire , \u201d said the top Biden adviser . \u201c I do n't know why the story in New Hampshire is n't how Bernie Sanders went from sixty to fourteen . And why is it that Biden is beating Warren in Massachusetts ? And he 's way ahead in South Carolina . And this is all on the back end of really the most vicious press I think anyone 's experienced . So that to me is a statement of strength . And anyone who 's sitting around waiting for him to fall apart\u2014you know what , it has n't happened yet . \u201d\nTo Biden \u2019 s advisers and allies , the gap between a press corps , as well as the wider online political class , that is largely in its twenties and thirties and a candidate who would be 78 at his Inaugural explains a lot about why the pundits and Twitter activists are so confounded by the former vice president \u2019 s resilience .\n\u201c You have a press corps in which most of them were in college when Barack Obama ran for president and they have fundamentally no understanding and experience in how politics works , \u201d said a well-known Democrat backing Biden . \u201c They have not really covered a true Democratic primary ever because there hasn \u2019 t been one since 2008 . The 2016 race didn \u2019 t become a real primary until very late and the press corps never thought Bernie would win . And Bernie never got the treatment from the press corps that opponents like him typically get . So they haven \u2019 t seen this kind of race . \u201d\nThis dynamic has produced what Beto O \u2019 Rourke might call a fuck-you attitude inside Biden world toward the press and liberal social media influencers who drool over Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s every policy paper and see Biden as hopelessly square .\nThe well-known Democrat said of the Biden press corps , \u201c They view this party as dominated by woke millennials and through the lens of coastal issues . They are products , increasingly , of fairly elite schools and they don \u2019 t talk to a lot of voters who don \u2019 t look and talk like them except their parents , who also tend to be similar to them . Occasionally they are shocked to learn they have relatives who voted for Donald Trump . And they were not on the ground in the Midwest primaries for governor races in 2018 in Michigan and Ohio and Wisconsin where more moderate and older and more experienced candidates won against young cool left \u2014 often people of color \u2014 primary opponents . \u201d\nThey are , this person argued , obsessed with a Democratic Party that exists only on Twitter . She pointedly noted that there are Democrats \u201c outside of those 18,000 voters in Queens , \u201d referring to the total vote share \u2014 it was actually closer to 17,000 \u2014 for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her June 2018 primary victory . \u201c And by the way , those didn \u2019 t even tend to be the economically disadvantaged people of color who live in that district . They were the quote \u2018 new people \u2019 if you talk to anyone from New York . \u201d\nHer point was that the AOC phenomenon \u201c is emblematic of what most reporters think is going on nationally . \u201d\nTo Biden world , it \u2019 s the media \u2019 s cultural affinity for this New New Left that explains why the Biden-will-soon-collapse storyline has such staying power .\n\u201c I get this question all the time : Why does the press hate him so much ? \u201d she said . \u201c And the answer is because they are younger and they want someone cooler . \u201d\nLast Saturday , 19 of the Democrats running for president spoke at an all-day convention of the New Hampshire Democratic Party in Manchester . The event attracts the state \u2019 s most important activists , as well as a good smattering of Democratic political junkies from around the northeast , and campaigns are under pressure to create some theatrics with supporters and signage and post-convention parties in nearby parks and beer halls .\nOn stage before the party delegates , several candidates began to make a more robust case against Biden . Elizabeth Warren owned the room , and the day , with an electric performance that also showcased her campaign \u2019 s ability to organize . She brought in many supporters from Massachusetts and outfitted them with inflatable thunder sticks , producing a well-choreographed but authentic audience response that her campaign immediately used for a promotional video . ( \u201c We did the same thing with Dukakis in \u2018 88 , \u201d one longtime Democratic strategist noted about busing in supporters from the neighboring state . )\nBiden \u2019 s message is that Trump represents a unique threat that requires Democratic voters to be careful and ultimately risk averse in choosing a nominee to face him \u2014an unmistakable warning not to elect someone too far to the left , such as Warren or Sanders .\nWarren \u2019 s response remains subtle , for now . \u201c There is a lot at stake and people are scared , \u201d Warren told the crowd on Saturday . \u201c But we can \u2019 t choose a candidate we don \u2019 t believe in because we \u2019 re scared . And we can \u2019 t ask other people to vote for someone we don \u2019 t believe in . I am not afraid and for Democrats to win you can \u2019 t be afraid either . \u201d\nThe assumption embedded in Warren \u2019 s line is that many of Biden \u2019 s supporters aren \u2019 t really enthusiastic about him , that they are backing him out of some misguided sense of obligation and fear , which also might explain his modest crowds and the lack of any Biden thunder-stick moments in this campaign .\nThis line of attack drives people inside the Biden campaign mad . To them it smacks of elitism and suggests that Warren and her most vocal supporters believe that Biden \u2019 s voters , who polls consistently show are more likely to be working class and people of color , are somehow not smart enough to understand why they support him .\n\u201c This gets back to the vitriol of the left , \u201d said the prominent Democrat . \u201c They seem to feel like , \u2018 Why don \u2019 t you dumb voters see what we see ? If we yell at you enough will you start to listen to us ? \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c The party is older than people think . It \u2019 s more centrist than people think , \u201d said the senior Biden adviser . He noted that Biden \u2019 s favorability rating among Democrats has been in the mid 70s since the start of this race .\n\u201c But they say he 's out of step with the party ! Well he \u2019 s the only person to demonstrate substantial support across a multiracial coalition . So actually he is most in step with the party . But no one ever sees it that way because that is not the world as seen through Twitter . \u201d\nSpeaking early in the day on Saturday , Biden gave his typical stump speech about beating Trump and rebuilding the middle class , but the only thing that really made any news was when , at one point , he accidentally said \u201c hump \u201d instead of \u201c Trump . \u201d\nOther candidates have begun beta testing a more direct anti-Biden message , and the intensity of the message seems closely correlated with how poorly the candidate \u2019 s campaign is faring . \u201c Democrats are long past believing that we want to be led by folks that supported the Iraq war and are long past a generation of politicians that could n't do anything about the income stagnation that exists in this country , \u201d Sen. Michael Bennet told me in an interview backstage . \u201c When you hear the vice president , who I 've nothing but the highest regard for , say that if we just get rid of Trump it will all go back to normal , which is what he 's saying , it misses the 10 years that I 've been in the Senate when it 's never been normal . And for the last six years of the Obama administration he couldn \u2019 t get anything done . \u201d\nLike others , Bennet argued that the polls were misleading and would get more volatile as voters focused more closely on the race . \u201c If history is any guide , the people that are leading today are not going to be the people that win in Iowa and win in New Hampshire , \u201d he insisted , adding with self-deprecation : \u201c And I 'm prepared to let history be our guide since I 'm at 1 percent today . \u201d\nAfter his speech , Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband , Chasten , played cornhole and ate ice-cream at a nearby park while mixing with supporters . In an interview , he made an anti-Biden case that put him somewhere between Warren and Bennet .\n\u201c Every single time Democrats have won it 's somebody who 's generally viewed as outside of Washington , typically somebody from a new generation and somebody with a different approach , \u201d he told me , noting the victories of Kennedy , Carter , Clinton and Obama . \u201c And every time we 've tried to do something very conventional , and very safe and had a very established Washington nominee , every time we 've come up short . This is not just a pattern . This has essentially been an iron law for the last 50 or 60 years . \u201d\nThe Biden camp scoffs at the generational argument . \u201c The last guy who tried this was out of the race in a week , that congressman from California , \u201d said the senior Biden adviser , who couldn \u2019 t remember the name of 38-year-old Eric Swalwell , who tried in vain to create a viral moment about generational change during the first debate . \u201c He was going to pass the torch . \u201d\nSwalwell told me he was wrong that this was the right moment for that message and doubted that a candidate like Buttigieg would be any more successful than he was . \u201c I felt like I was in a bad traffic jam with no offramp and no way to get ahead , \u201d he said in an interview about his short-lived campaign . \u201c And certainly the lead car was the vice president . I don \u2019 t know if this is a generational election because of who the president is . Beating him is so important because of who he is and what a threat to democracy he is . It is still early and there are still other generational candidates but my sense is that this isn \u2019 t a \u2018 Don \u2019 t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow \u2019 election . The stakes are so high with this president that there is a fear of rolling the dice . \u201d\nYounger candidates like Pete Buttigieg have angled themselves as a generational change \u2014 but Joe Biden 's team has dismissed the need for a fresher face . | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo\nPerhaps the one line of attack that just might work against Biden is , at least for the moment , the only area of criticism considered strictly off limits by almost every campaign . Most of Biden \u2019 s opponents are scared to directly confront the one issue that both his gaffes and all the talk about generational change tiptoe around : his age .\nI rode with Steve Bullock , the governor of Montana , to the convention arena . He is supremely confident and polished and in the back seat of his SUV discussed his successes as governor , his frustrations about being excluded from the next debate , and his concerns about the leftward lunge of his party . The only time he seemed to hold back was when I raised the issue of whether Biden was really up for the job . \u201c I think that 's one for the voters to figure out more than me , \u201d he said . ( His campaign manager escalated the rhetoric slightly in a memo sent to reporters on Tuesday that said , \u201c there is a growing fear that the candidates promising revolutions are out of step with general election voters while others fear Vice President Biden may be unable to take down Trump . \u201d )\nIn the afternoon , the issue of Biden \u2019 s age and mental acuity suddenly burst open in the airless media room where most of the candidates , though not Biden , spoke with reporters after their speeches . I asked Rep. Tim Ryan , who the previous day had been quoted saying that Biden was \u201c declining , \u201d whether he meant declining in the polls or mentally declining and he made it clear he meant the latter . Pressed further by another reporter , he would only say \u201c there \u2019 s a lack of clarity \u201d when Biden speaks . ( \u201c You know , with Ryan , if he declines anymore he 's going from like one to zero , \u201d the senior Biden adviser told me in response . )\nBut Ryan was alone in raising the issue . Afterward I visited Sen. Amy Klobuchar in her suite and , she too refused to engage on the subject when I mentioned Ryan \u2019 s remarks . \u201c I 'm running my own campaign , \u201d she said through bites of an apple , explaining why she wouldn \u2019 t discuss Biden or any of her other opponents . After five minutes of pressing her about how to differentiate herself from Biden , she essentially ended the interview . Like several other candidates , her strategy remains one of waiting for Biden \u2019 s collapse rather than trying to trigger it .\nBut offstage , in the backrooms of the SNHU Arena and nearby hotel lobbies where activists and aides gathered , the discussion frequently turned to whether Biden is up to the task of facing Trump .\n\u201c The narrative that Biden has staying power is bullshit , \u201d said a senior adviser to one of Biden \u2019 s rivals . \u201c It is just too fucking early . Did we not learn anything from 2016 that polls are shit ? The dude does not know what is going on . He is not in fighting shape to beat Trump . You put him on stage together with Trump and they \u2019 re both gon na forget shit but Trump is sharper . The dude is just old and it \u2019 s showing and they \u2019 re fighting every day to make the case that \u2019 s not happening but it is . \u201d\nBut only Bakari Sellers , a former South Carolina state legislator and supporter and informal adviser to Sen. Kamala Harris , was willing to say the quiet part out loud .\n\u201c Joe Biden has been running for president since before I was born , \u201d Sellers said . \u201c Joe Biden is nearly 80 years old and he \u2019 s running to be president of the United States . My dad was president of an HBCU and will be 75 this year and his doctors told him he couldn \u2019 t do it anymore . He didn \u2019 t have the energy and strength to lead that campus anymore . Doesn \u2019 t mean he wasn \u2019 t a great man and a great leader and a great visionary . But it is a justifiable conversation . \u201d\nSellers went further and lumped Sanders and Warren into the debate about age . \u201c The three front-runners are all older than Ronald Reagan was when he took over , \u201d he said . \u201c Democrats are afraid of criticism , which is silly to me . But we are going to have a contentious primary on vigor and issues about fitness to be president . \u201d\nThen he paused and added , \u201c But at the end of the day I \u2019 ll take a 90-year old Joe Biden over Donald Trump . \u201d\nThe tricky part about attacking Biden is that few Democratic voters have any hostility toward Biden personally . The most aggressive public attack against him was by Harris in the first debate , when she confronted him about his past positions on busing and working with segregationist senators . She juiced her fundraising in the days following the debate and received a spike in national polls , but her numbers soon settled back down to where they were , at about seven percent . Biden \u2019 s advisers now frequently mention the episode as a cautionary tale for others .\n\u201c Kamala going after Biden didn \u2019 t really work out for her so I \u2019 m curious to see how many try that again on Thursday , \u201d said a Democrat close to the Biden campaign . \u201c How do you tear down the front-runner that everyone actually likes ? \u201d\nHe added , \u201c Do I believe that Joe Biden is the future of the party ? No . But he \u2019 s the right person to beat this president in 2020 . ''",

They were the quote \u2018new people\u2019 if you talk to anyone from New York.\u201d\n\nHer point was that the AOC phenomenon \u201cis emblematic of what most reporters think is going on nationally.\u201d\n\nTo Biden world, it\u2019s the media\u2019s cultural affinity for this New New Left that explains why the Biden-will-soon-collapse storyline has such staying power.\n\n\u201cI get this question all the time: Why does the press hate him so much?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the answer is because they are younger and they want someone cooler.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nLast Saturday, 19 of the Democrats running for president spoke at an all-day convention of the New Hampshire Democratic Party in Manchester. The event attracts the state\u2019s most important activists, as well as a good smattering of Democratic political junkies from around the northeast, and campaigns are under pressure to create some theatrics with supporters and signage and post-convention parties in nearby parks and beer halls.\n\nOn stage before the party delegates, several candidates began to make a more robust case against Biden. Elizabeth Warren owned the room, and the day, with an electric performance that also showcased her campaign\u2019s ability to organize. She brought in many supporters from Massachusetts and outfitted them with inflatable thunder sticks, producing a well-choreographed but authentic audience response that her campaign immediately used for a promotional video. (\u201cWe did the same thing with Dukakis in \u201888,\u201d one longtime Democratic strategist noted about busing in supporters from the neighboring state.)\n\nBiden\u2019s message is that Trump represents a unique threat that requires Democratic voters to be careful and ultimately risk averse in choosing a nominee to face him \u2014an unmistakable warning not to elect someone too far to the left, such as Warren or Sanders.\n\nWarren\u2019s response remains subtle, for now. \u201cThere is a lot at stake and people are scared,\u201d Warren told the crowd on Saturday. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared. And we can\u2019t ask other people to vote for someone we don\u2019t believe in. I am not afraid and for Democrats to win you can\u2019t be afraid either.\u201d\n\nThe assumption embedded in Warren\u2019s line is that many of Biden\u2019s supporters aren\u2019t really enthusiastic about him, that they are backing him out of some misguided sense of obligation and fear, which also might explain his modest crowds and the lack of any Biden thunder-stick moments in this campaign.\n\nThis line of attack drives people inside the Biden campaign mad. To them it smacks of elitism and suggests that Warren and her most vocal supporters believe that Biden\u2019s voters, who polls consistently show are more likely to be working class and people of color, are somehow not smart enough to understand why they support him.\n\n\u201cThis gets back to the vitriol of the left,\u201d said the prominent Democrat. \u201cThey seem to feel like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you dumb voters see what we see? If we yell at you enough will you start to listen to us?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe party is older than people think. It\u2019s more centrist than people think,\u201d said the senior Biden adviser. He noted that Biden\u2019s favorability rating among Democrats has been in the mid 70s since the start of this race.\n\n\u201cBut they say he's out of step with the party! Well he\u2019s the only person to demonstrate substantial support across a multiracial coalition. So actually he is most in step with the party. But no one ever sees it that way because that is not the world as seen through Twitter.\u201d\n\nSpeaking early in the day on Saturday, Biden gave his typical stump speech about beating Trump and rebuilding the middle class, but the only thing that really made any news was when, at one point, he accidentally said \u201chump\u201d instead of \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nOther candidates have begun beta testing a more direct anti-Biden message, and the intensity of the message seems closely correlated with how poorly the candidate\u2019s campaign is faring. \u201cDemocrats are long past believing that we want to be led by folks that supported the Iraq war and are long past a generation of politicians that couldn't do anything about the income stagnation that exists in this country,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet told me in an interview backstage. \u201cWhen you hear the vice president, who I've nothing but the highest regard for, say that if we just get rid of Trump it will all go back to normal, which is what he's saying, it misses the 10 years that I've been in the Senate when it's never been normal. And for the last six years of the Obama administration he couldn\u2019t get anything done.\u201d\n\nLike others, Bennet argued that the polls were misleading and would get more volatile as voters focused more closely on the race. \u201cIf history is any guide, the people that are leading today are not going to be the people that win in Iowa and win in New Hampshire,\u201d he insisted, adding with self-deprecation: \u201cAnd I'm prepared to let history be our guide since I'm at 1 percent today.\u201d\n\nAfter his speech, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, played cornhole and ate ice-cream at a nearby park while mixing with supporters. In an interview, he made an anti-Biden case that put him somewhere between Warren and Bennet.\n\n\u201cEvery single time Democrats have won it's somebody who's generally viewed as outside of Washington, typically somebody from a new generation and somebody with a different approach,\u201d he told me, noting the victories of Kennedy, Carter, Clinton and Obama. \u201cAnd every time we've tried to do something very conventional, and very safe and had a very established Washington nominee, every time we've come up short. This is not just a pattern. This has essentially been an iron law for the last 50 or 60 years.\u201d\n\nThe Biden camp scoffs at the generational argument. \u201cThe last guy who tried this was out of the race in a week, that congressman from California,\u201d said the senior Biden adviser, who couldn\u2019t remember the name of 38-year-old Eric Swalwell, who tried in vain to create a viral moment about generational change during the first debate. \u201cHe was going to pass the torch.\u201d\n\nSwalwell told me he was wrong that this was the right moment for that message and doubted that a candidate like Buttigieg would be any more successful than he was. \u201cI felt like I was in a bad traffic jam with no offramp and no way to get ahead,\u201d he said in an interview about his short-lived campaign. \u201cAnd certainly the lead car was the vice president. I don\u2019t know if this is a generational election because of who the president is. Beating him is so important because of who he is and what a threat to democracy he is. It is still early and there are still other generational candidates but my sense is that this isn\u2019t a \u2018Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow\u2019 election. The stakes are so high with this president that there is a fear of rolling the dice.\u201d\n\nYounger candidates like Pete Buttigieg have angled themselves as a generational change \u2014 but Joe Biden's team has dismissed the need for a fresher face. | Charlie Neibergall/AP Photo\n\nPerhaps the one line of attack that just might work against Biden is, at least for the moment, the only area of criticism considered strictly off limits by almost every campaign. Most of Biden\u2019s opponents are scared to directly confront the one issue that both his gaffes and all the talk about generational change tiptoe around: his age.\n\nI rode with Steve Bullock, the governor of Montana, to the convention arena. He is supremely confident and polished and in the back seat of his SUV discussed his successes as governor, his frustrations about being excluded from the next debate, and his concerns about the leftward lunge of his party. The only time he seemed to hold back was when I raised the issue of whether Biden was really up for the job. \u201cI think that's one for the voters to figure out more than me,\u201d he said. (His campaign manager escalated the rhetoric slightly in a memo sent to reporters on Tuesday that said, \u201cthere is a growing fear that the candidates promising revolutions are out of step with general election voters while others fear Vice President Biden may be unable to take down Trump.\u201d)\n\nIn the afternoon, the issue of Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity suddenly burst open in the airless media room where most of the candidates, though not Biden, spoke with reporters after their speeches. I asked Rep. Tim Ryan, who the previous day had been quoted saying that Biden was \u201cdeclining,\u201d whether he meant declining in the polls or mentally declining and he made it clear he meant the latter. Pressed further by another reporter, he would only say \u201cthere\u2019s a lack of clarity\u201d when Biden speaks. (\u201cYou know, with Ryan, if he declines anymore he's going from like one to zero,\u201d the senior Biden adviser told me in response.)\n\nBut Ryan was alone in raising the issue. Afterward I visited Sen. Amy Klobuchar in her suite and, she too refused to engage on the subject when I mentioned Ryan\u2019s remarks. \u201cI'm running my own campaign,\u201d she said through bites of an apple, explaining why she wouldn\u2019t discuss Biden or any of her other opponents. After five minutes of pressing her about how to differentiate herself from Biden, she essentially ended the interview. Like several other candidates, her strategy remains one of waiting for Biden\u2019s collapse rather than trying to trigger it.\n\nBut offstage, in the backrooms of the SNHU Arena and nearby hotel lobbies where activists and aides gathered, the discussion frequently turned to whether Biden is up to the task of facing Trump.\n\n\u201cThe narrative that Biden has staying power is bullshit,\u201d said a senior adviser to one of Biden\u2019s rivals. \u201cIt is just too fucking early. Did we not learn anything from 2016 that polls are shit? The dude does not know what is going on. He is not in fighting shape to beat Trump. You put him on stage together with Trump and they\u2019re both gonna forget shit but Trump is sharper. The dude is just old and it\u2019s showing and they\u2019re fighting every day to make the case that\u2019s not happening but it is.\u201d\n\nBut only Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state legislator and supporter and informal adviser to Sen. Kamala Harris, was willing to say the quiet part out loud.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden has been running for president since before I was born,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cJoe Biden is nearly 80 years old and he\u2019s running to be president of the United States. My dad was president of an HBCU and will be 75 this year and his doctors told him he couldn\u2019t do it anymore. He didn\u2019t have the energy and strength to lead that campus anymore. Doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t a great man and a great leader and a great visionary. But it is a justifiable conversation.\u201d\n\nSellers went further and lumped Sanders and Warren into the debate about age. \u201cThe three front-runners are all older than Ronald Reagan was when he took over,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats are afraid of criticism, which is silly to me. But we are going to have a contentious primary on vigor and issues about fitness to be president.\u201d\n\nThen he paused and added, \u201cBut at the end of the day I\u2019ll take a 90-year old Joe Biden over Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe tricky part about attacking Biden is that few Democratic voters have any hostility toward Biden personally. The most aggressive public attack against him was by Harris in the first debate, when she confronted him about his past positions on busing and working with segregationist senators. She juiced her fundraising in the days following the debate and received a spike in national polls, but her numbers soon settled back down to where they were, at about seven percent. Biden\u2019s advisers now frequently mention the episode as a cautionary tale for others.\n\n\u201cKamala going after Biden didn\u2019t really work out for her so I\u2019m curious to see how many try that again on Thursday,\u201d said a Democrat close to the Biden campaign. \u201cHow do you tear down the front-runner that everyone actually likes?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cDo I believe that Joe Biden is the future of the party? No. But he\u2019s the right person to beat this president in 2020.\"",
