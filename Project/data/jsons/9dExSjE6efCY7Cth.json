    "content": "Republican lawmakers have written to the head of the Transportation Security Administration questioning whether a recent contract for new uniforms worth as much as $ 50 million was money well spent -- when officials are warning that budget cuts will cause staff shortages and flight delays .\n`` The rationale behind the timing of TSA 's uniform contract and other uncertainties surrounding the contract award raise concerns , '' the lawmakers wrote . The letter to TSA chief John Pistole was signed by Reps. Jason Chaffetz , R-Utah , and John Mica , R-Fla. , who each chair House oversight subcommittees .\nThe letter comes after the TSA agreed on a deal last month worth up to $ 50 million to purchase new uniforms . Agency officials signed the contract just days before the start of the $ 85 billion in federal budget cuts known as sequester .\nThe TSA , while trying to avert furloughs , says it will first use a hiring freeze and a reduction in overtime to cut costs -- while warning this will still result in longer lines at the airport . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano earlier this month said wait times were already going up , though there are mixed reports on such delays .\nOn Feb. 22 , a few days before the TSA contract was signed , Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood also said the sequester cuts could result in flight delays as long as 90 minutes at major airports in Chicago , New York and San Francisco and warned about furloughing air traffic controllers .\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has since moved to shut down 149 air traffic control towers . FAA is part of the Department of Transportation , while TSA is under the Department of Homeland Security .\nThe letter from Chaffetz and Mica -- which referenced an earlier FoxNews.com report on the contract -- cited the repeated warnings from top officials about the impact of sequester cuts while requesting more information on the uniform deal . They requested a briefing from the agency and asked whether `` any consideration '' was given to a delay in the new uniforms `` in light of the possible impacts of sequestration . ''\nThe TSA , in a statement , stressed that the $ 50 million figure represents the `` maximum value , not the amount expended , '' and that the contract was meant to fill a gap in service .\nThe agency explained that the contract was needed after the prior contract -- which covers replacing worn uniforms and providing them to new hires -- expired Feb. 17 .\n`` The new DHS-wide contract to purchase all component uniforms wo n't take effect until next year , so TSA signed an interim two-year contract on February 22 , 2013 with a $ 50-million dollar ceiling to continue to procure new uniforms , '' the agency said . `` Without the contract bridge , TSA would not have been able to procure additional uniforms which are lower than or equal to the cost of any other uniform worn by officers in the federal government . ''\nThe one-year contract with VF Imagewear Inc. provides employees with such clothing and accessories as shirts , pants , a belt and socks .\nHowever , the company , better known for its Lee and Wrangler brand jeans , can agree to extend the contract an additional 12 months .
