    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Three Veterans Affairs health care professionals who reported patient care issues say the agency continues to try to silence them , jeopardizing veterans and undercutting a key Trump promise of whistleblower protection .\nThey work at different sites \u2013 in the Phoenix area , Baltimore , and Iowa City , Iowa \u2013 yet the VA response has been similar . All were stripped of assigned patient-care and oversight duties , and they suspect VA managers are retaliating against them for speaking out , and sidelining them to prevent them from discovering or disclosing any more problems with veteran health care .\nIn exclusive interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , their assertions contradict proclamations by agency leaders and President Donald Trump that VA employees who disclose wrongdoing at the agency are being celebrated and not scorned .\n`` The VA is two-faced : What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things , '' said Katherine Mitchell , a physician who reported shortfalls in care at the Phoenix VA that earned her a federal `` Public Servant of the Year Award '' in 2014 .\nMitchell is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing Tuesday examining the treatment of whistleblowers at the VA. She will be joined by Iowa City CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn , who blew the whistle on mass-cancellations of diagnostic test orders , and Baltimore VA psychologist Minu Aghevli , who reported veterans had been removed improperly from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment .\nMitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out sends a signal to other employees to keep their mouths shut and `` jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system . ''\n`` Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans , '' she said . `` If people can \u2019 t identify problems , veterans will suffer and die . That \u2019 s what it boils down to . ''\nTrump signed an executive order creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection and then a law making it permanent in 2017 . Early reviews were promising \u2013 within several months , the office had delayed disciplinary actions against 70 VA employees who disclosed alleged wrongdoing .\nBut the VA inspector general has since launched a wide-ranging investigation of the office \u2019 s handling of whistleblower cases and reports of problems .\nThe Government Accountability Office issued a report last July that said the office allowed officials accused of wrongdoing or retaliation to be involved in investigations of the accusations \u2013 calling into question their independence and findings . And leadership at the office has turned over multiple times , causing confusion and disruption .\nTrump signs law : VA bill to protect whistleblowers , expedite firing of problem workers\nExclusive : Inside Trump 's new VA office , early moves to help whistleblowers draw praise\nIn response to inquiries from \u2588\u2588\u2588 , VA spokesman Randall Noller issued a statement Wednesday saying the agency `` welcomes the inspector general \u2019 s oversight . ''\n`` For the last several months , we \u2019 ve been cooperating closely with the IG on its assessment and encouraging the office to release its report as soon as possible , '' he said .\nAn assistant secretary who took over the office in January , Tamara Bonzanto , plans to use its findings as a `` roadmap '' for improving office operations , Noller said . In the meantime , she has been `` working on a number of key improvements . ''\n`` These include providing timelier resolutions , more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers , '' he said .\nNoller declined to say what policies are in place to ensure the office doesn \u2019 t allow managers accused of wrongdoing or retaliation to be involved in investigating the accusations . Noller also declined to comment on assertions made by Aghevli , Dettbarn and Mitchell , citing federal privacy laws .\nWhistleblower advocates say they haven \u2019 t seen much difference in recent years . Jacqueline Garrick , founder of non-profit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America , said more than 190 VA employees have contacted her since 2017 , complaining about retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency , most about how veterans are treated .\nShe said those who have gone to the Trump-created whistleblower protection office for help said the office 's employees turned around and investigated them instead , launching `` counter accusations and further retaliation . ''\nShe said Bonzanto told her in February she planned to `` reset '' the office \u2019 s operations . Still , Garrick said , `` I haven \u2019 t seen any real sign of that . ''\nShe and other advocates also are slated to testify before Congress Tuesday at the hearing before the House VA Committee \u2019 s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations examining whistleblower concerns .\nIn Iowa City , Dettbarn noticed something was awry in 2017 when patients showed up to get CT scans but orders for the tests had been cancelled in the computer system .\nHe reported the problems to administrators , who later admitted they had been mass-cancelling diagnostic test orders as part of a national effort to clear out a backlog of out-dated or duplicate orders .\nWeeks after Dettbarn reported his concerns that orders had been cancelled without contacting patients or a medical review to determine if veterans still needed the tests , he was removed from his job and then transferred to another position , pending an investigation \u2013 of him .\nHe said he has been spending all day every day making copies and doing other paperwork ever since , nearly two years later . Dettbarn went to the whistleblower protection office for help , but said he did n't hear back for months on end . `` As far as I know , I 'm still under investigation , '' he said .\nHe wants to go back to caring for patients , and he worries about being away from the diagnostic clinic for so long .\n`` There 's nobody there to watch out for the veterans , '' he said . `` They 've got everybody else scared to say anything . Who 's taking care of those patients ? ''\nInvestigation : Mass cancellations of diagnostic test orders at VA hospitals draw scrutiny\nIn Baltimore , Aghevli began reporting problems with wait lists five years ago , at the same time a national scandal unfolded about VA wait times following revelations that veterans died while they waited for care at the VA hospital in Phoenix .\nAghevli , coordinator of the opioid-addiction treatment program at the VA Maryland Health Care System , reported being pressured by supervisors to remove veterans from a wait list for treatment and schedule them in an `` imaginary clinic '' so the list would appear shorter .\n`` Suddenly our wait list went from being well over 100 to being minimal , I mean , well under 20 , '' she said .\nA review of her allegations by the VA inspector general later concluded veterans were removed from the list and placed in `` non-count '' status , even though they still wanted opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA .\nBut Aghevli said she quickly became `` unpopular '' with supervisors who turned around in the ensuing years and investigated her repeatedly , tried to transfer her , and threatened to shut down her program \u2013 which serves roughly 400 veterans . She said they excluded her from meetings , changed her hours , and at one point , detailed her to clerical duties .\nThrough it all , she continued to report patient care problems when she came across them \u2013 including improper discharges , short-staffing and medication issues \u2013 to her supervisors , to the inspector general and to members of Congress .\n`` If I see somebody not getting adequate treatment , or not getting treatment that 's clinically indicated , I will speak up about it , '' Aghevli said .\nBut she said she is still being retaliated against . In April , Baltimore VA officials once again moved her out of her job to a data entry post and stripped her of her clinical privileges , pending investigation . Aghevli said the reason they gave was that she had visited a veteran patient in a non-VA hospital after he had suffered a health crisis , a situation that ostensibly could give rise to charges she was practicing at a hospital where she did n't work .\nAghevli called the explanation `` nonsensical .
