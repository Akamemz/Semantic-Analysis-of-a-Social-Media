    "content": "There probably isn \u2019 t much doubt how Mathena v. Malvo , a case the Supreme Court will hear on Wednesday , will wind up being resolved .\nThe \u201c Malvo \u201d in this case is Lee Boyd Malvo , one half of the infamous pair of serial killers who terrorized the Washington , DC area with a sniper rampage in 2002 . He was 17 at the time of the rampage , and he claims that the sentencing courts did not follow the proper process for condemning a juvenile offender to life without parole \u2014 though it \u2019 s doubtful that a majority of the Court will agree with him .\nSeveral of the justices lived in the DC area during the three-week period when residents were scared to go outside for fear that they would be killed by Malvo and his partner , John Allen Muhammad . Malvo \u2019 s legal arguments rest on a fairly aggressive reading of a 2012 Supreme Court decision that split the Court 5-4 . Notably , former Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the key fifth vote in that decision .\nBut even in the likely event that Malvo loses , it matters a great deal how Malvo loses . Malvo claims that he was sentenced in violation of the Eighth Amendment \u2019 s prohibition on \u201c cruel and unusual punishments. \u201d And the Supreme Court signaled just a few months ago that it wants to dramatically roll back the scope of that amendment .\nLast April , in Bucklew v. Precythe , the Supreme Court signaled that it plans a wholesale rethinking of how it understands the Eighth Amendment . Malvo is the Court \u2019 s first Eighth Amendment case since Bucklew , so it could offer a window into just how deeply the Court \u2019 s Republican majority plans to cut into the shield against bizarre and excessive punishments .\nMalvo could prove to be a fairly minor case , which simply states that the Court will not apply its 2012 decision in Miller v. Alabama \u2014 which held that \u201c the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders \u201d \u2014 in the specific way that Malvo seeks . In theory , the case could also end in a victory for Malvo , although that outcome seems unlikely .\nWhat makes this case significant , however , is that it could be the second phase of the doctrinal revolution that the Court began in Bucklew \u2014 and it could signal that criminal defendants enjoy far fewer protections against cruel and unusual punishments than they do under existing law .\nThe Eighth Amendment \u2019 s decay began four years ago , as part of an effort to save the death penalty\nBucklew is , at once , one of the most ghoulish cases ever to reach the Supreme Court , and one of the most significant opinions of the Roberts era .\nThe case involved Russell Bucklew , a death row inmate with cavernous hemangioma , a disease \u201c which causes vascular tumors \u2014 clumps of blood vessels \u2014 to grow in his head , neck , and throat. \u201d Bucklew feared that the lethal dose of barbiturates the state of Missouri planned to give him at his execution would cause him to choke on his own tumors , leading to extreme pain and suffering in his final minutes .\nIn effect , Bucklew \u2019 s claim was that the Eighth Amendment did not allow him to be tortured to death .\nRealistically , Bucklew \u2019 s case was doomed long before it arrived at the Supreme Court . In Glossip v. Gross ( 2015 ) , a 5-4 Court held that the death penalty enjoys a kind of super-legal status . In the lead up to Glossip , several manufacturers of drugs commonly used in executions refused to sell them to states that intended to use them to kill someone . Some of those states responded by using painkillers of dubious reliability to execute prisoners . As Justice Elena Kagan warned in her Glossip dissent , the drug cocktails used by these states could cause people to experience \u201c the feeling of being burned alive \u201d during their execution .\nAnd yet all five of the Court \u2019 s Republican appointees , including Kennedy , joined an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito that suggested that the death penalty must be defended against drug companies that seek to undercut it . \u201c Because it is settled that capital punishment is constitutional , \u201d Alito wrote , \u201c \u2018 [ i ] t necessarily follows that there must be a [ constitutional ] means of carrying it out . \u2019 \u201d\nIf an inmate believed that a particular method would be painful , or even torturous , the burden was on that inmate to propose a different method of execution that would cause less pain .\nGlossip , however , did not provide much of a theoretical framework to justify its result . It largely began with the premise that the death penalty must be allowed , and then reasoned from that conclusion . Bucklew , which was decided after Kennedy left the Court , was the Court \u2019 s first attempt to put some doctrinal heft behind Glossip \u2019 s defense of executions . But the theory of the Eighth Amendment articulated in Bucklew is at odds with decades of settled law .\nRecall that the Eighth Amendment prohibits \u201c cruel and unusual \u201d punishments . In a seminal 1958 opinion , Chief Justice Earl Warren argued that the amendment bans punishments that defy \u201c evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society. \u201d Thus , as a particular form of punishment grows more and more \u201c unusual , \u201d it grows more and more constitutionally suspect .\nIf taken seriously , Warren \u2019 s framework is an existential threat to the death penalty itself . As the Death Penalty Information Center chronicles , both new death sentences and actual executions are disappearing in most of the country .\nOnly eight states conducted executions in 2018 , with Texas accounting for more than half ( 13 ) of the 25 total executions .\nRather than follow Warren \u2019 s reasoning to its end point , Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2019 s majority opinion in Bucklew simply ignores the \u201c evolving standards of decency \u201d framework altogether . Instead , Gorsuch suggests that the scope of the Eighth Amendment was defined in the eighteenth century and that it may never change .\n\u201c Death was \u2018 the standard penalty for all serious crimes \u2019 at the time of the founding , \u201d Gorsuch writes . \u201c Nor did the later addition of the Eighth Amendment outlaw the practice . On the contrary \u2014 the Fifth Amendment , added to the Constitution at the same time as the Eighth , expressly contemplates that a defendant may be tried for a \u2018 capital \u2019 crime and \u2018 deprived of life \u2019 as a penalty , so long as proper procedures are followed . \u201d\nGorsuch does list some methods of execution \u2014 \u201c dragging the prisoner to the place of execution , disemboweling , quartering , public dissection , and burning alive \u201d \u2014 that do violate the Eighth Amendment . But what sets these punishments aside is the fact that \u201c by the time of the founding , these methods had long fallen out of use and so had become \u2018 unusual . \u2019 \u201d\nBucklew did not explicitly overrule the \u201c evolving standards of decency \u201d test , but it is impossible to square Gorsuch \u2019 s framework with Warren \u2019 s . Warren read the Eighth Amendment as a restriction on punishments that are \u201c unusual \u201d at the time when they are imposed , but Gorsuch reads the amendment to only ban punishments that were \u201c unusual \u201d in 1791 .\nIf the Court follows Gorsuch \u2019 s new test to its logical extreme , the consequences would be quite dire for criminal defendants . Though Kennedy joined Alito \u2019 s opinion in Glossip , the former swing justice frequently voted with his liberal colleagues in cases asking whether especially harsh punishments could be applied to people that Kennedy believed to have diminished mental capacity .\nThus , in Atkins v. Virginia ( 2002 ) , Kennedy joined an opinion holding that the death penalty could not be applied to intellectually disabled offenders . He reached a similar conclusion in Roper v. Simmons ( 2005 ) , which held that the Constitution forbids \u201c imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when their crimes were committed. \u201d And , in Miller v. Alabama ( 2012 ) , Kennedy joined a decision holding that \u201c the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders . \u201d\nAll three of these opinions , however , rested on the \u201c evolving standards of decency \u201d framework that the Court appeared to scrap in Bucklew . And thus , all of them could potentially be on the chopping block now that Kennedy is no longer around to protect them .\nWhich brings us back to Malvo . Malvo , who was 17 during his 2002 sniping rampage , argues for a broad reading of Miller . Under his reading of the decision , \u201c Miller requires not only that sentencers be permitted to consider youth , but also that they actually do so , to determine whether life without parole is a proportionate sentence. \u201d Thus , Malvo claims his sentence was invalid because the sentencing judge did not consider Malvo \u2019 s youth at the time of the offense .\nThe state , for its part , argues that Miller only forbids \u201c mandatory \u201d schemes that automatically apply a sentence of life without parole to certain juvenile offenders .\nIf Kennedy were still on the Court , Malvo \u2019 s argument might have a shot . But it is unlikely to prevail in the current Supreme Court . The best criminal justice reformers can realistically hope for is a decision rejecting Malvo \u2019 s reading of Miller and embracing the state \u2019 s .\nMalvo , however , could go much further than that . It could potentially apply Bucklew \u2019 s new framework to overrule Miller itself . And it could cast other decisions like Atkins and Roper into grave doubt . Malvo , in other words , could tell us whether Bucklew was simply a one-off effort to come up with a doctrinal justification for the death penalty , or whether it was the beginning of a constitutional revolution .\nAnd if the revolution is upon us , states could gain broad new powers to impose punishments that are now widely viewed as cruel and unusual . In a famous 1988 lecture , Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that \u201c public flogging \u201d was a permissible punishment at the time of the framing , though he labeled himself a \u201c faint-hearted originalist \u201d because he doubted that he would uphold an attempt to flog a criminal offender .\nIndeed , it is doubtful that Gorsuch \u2019 s view of the Eighth Amendment would prevent such public inflictions of pain . Britain did not abolish \u201c the punishment of whipping \u201d until 1948 , a fairly convincing sign that this punishment was acceptable to the former English colonists that founded the United States . The Delaware Supreme Court upheld statutes imposing \u201c the penalty of lashes \u201d as recently as 1963 .\nThe Court already held , in Glossip and Bucklew , that an inmate may be tortured to death , at least in effect , if not necessarily in intent . The scope of the Eighth Amendment is now in the hands of judges who believe that such punishment is acceptable .\nAfter a sleepy spring term , the Supreme Court of the United States is back and looking to weigh in on abortion , immigration , and LGBTQ rights .\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle ?
