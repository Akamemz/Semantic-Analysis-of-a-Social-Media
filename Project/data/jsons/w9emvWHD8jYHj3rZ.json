    "content": "In a Manhattan Fox News studio on a recent Tuesday in February , Shepard Smith sits ready to begin taping his 3 p.m. newscast . He \u2019 s spent the preceding hour typing out edits to his script with slightly hunched posture , raising his eyebrows at his keyboard and reading his monologue to himself to test its accuracy and its cadence . The computers behind him\u2014clad in giant white shells , they look like robots from the Star Wars universe\u2014are each manned by researchers . Several of them are scanning their email and news sites , one is looking at @ realdonaldtrump on Twitter . And Smith , wired with an earpiece to the control room , is periodically issuing commands\u2014to those researchers , to the producers who call his desk phone , to the air around him . \u201c We need to get a statement from Israeli police , \u201d he says , looking to bulk up a wire report about Benjamin Netanyahu . \u201c That \u2019 ll give the Jerusalem bureau something to do . \u201d\nShepard Smith at Fox News ' offices in New York , Thursday , March 1 , 2018 . Andres Kudacki for TIME\nWhen the countdown to Smith \u2019 s hour of airtime arrives at 2:59 , it \u2019 s just a number . Smith silently sits at his anchor chair , watching White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders field questions from reporters in what \u2019 s become a near-daily occurrence : his show is getting pre-empted by the most popular political drama in America . He scrolls through his phone , then leans forward on his elbows ready for Sanders to wrap . When she does , he kicks off his show a few minutes late with discussion of the \u201c brand-new timeline \u201d Sanders offered for the scandal of the day . Much of his script now useless , Smith does the work of writing and editing as he speaks .\nThe president has scrambled the day-to-day lives of everyone in the news business , not least of which those at the network with which Donald Trump begins every morning . As Fox has tacked further to the right in its opinion programming , Smith \u2019 s role has at times seemed like a challenge . Being the old-fashioned anchorman and reporter at a network known for new-fashioned provocation and opinion may be the hardest job at Fox News , and one Smith mused about walking away from over the course of two interviews this winter . On March 15 , the network announced Smith would stay and that he had signed a multiyear contract renewal . Which means Smith is going to have many more chances to tell viewers what they don \u2019 t want to hear .\n\u201c I can remember a time , \u201d the 54-year-old anchor says after taping has wrapped at 4 p.m. , \u201c when we would do a rundown in the morning and , probably , that \u2019 s what would happen. \u201d Those around him are feeling the Trump era as well . \u201c I \u2019 m tired , \u201d says Kim Rosenberg , the network \u2019 s vice-president of news and Smith \u2019 s producer and friend . \u201c The news cycle goes through many evolutions during the day . Trump will tweet or they \u2019 ll add a news conference or the White House briefing will be pushed back three times , and the news cycle changes . \u201d\nNow , his show is often eaten into by the White House \u2019 s televised press briefings . \u201c Even now , it still boggles my mind that the next time Sarah Huckabee Sanders is on , over a year into a presidency , that it is something that all three networks will take live , \u201d says Jay Wallace , the network \u2019 s president of news since 2017 and Smith \u2019 s former executive producer . \u201c That \u2019 s unheard-of. \u201d Having hustled in his early career and established his bona fides as an anchor after that , Smith would seem to be at a point where he could enjoy the status , visibility , and routine schedule a marquee anchor enjoys . Instead , Sanders , and her boss , have created a climate of uncertainty that \u2019 s forced Smith to improvise .\nSmith , a Mississippi native who retains the lilt and the flattened sentence endings of rural hometown Holly Springs , began his career as a local news-affiliate reporter in Florida . He joined Fox News at its founding in 1996 and eventually came to have both daytime and evening broadcasts . In 1999 , he launched The Fox Report , the network \u2019 s flagship newscast and its version of what the broadcast networks do at 6:30 p.m. Smith became Fox \u2019 s closest analogue to the classic voice-of-God newsman . In 2013 , the evening show was cancelled . \u201c There used to be a thought that , hey , we need a nightly newscast later in the day , \u201d says Wallace . \u201c Those patterns have changed , just with the way we consume media. \u201d Now Fox \u2019 s night-time slate is dominated by opinion\u2014the fire-breathing sort practiced by Tucker Carlson at eight , Sean Hannity at nine , and Laura Ingraham at ten .\nTheir coexistence with Smith is increasingly uneasy . In November 2017 , Smith briskly and effectively debunked the \u201c Uranium One \u201d conspiracy theory , a particular bugbear of Hannity \u2019 s . Reporting live on the air in the hours after the February school shooting in Parkland , Fla. , Smith read a list of schools that had endured fatal gun violence since Columbine . And this month , Smith said on-air that the president , who \u2019 d called for raising the age limit for buying firearms , had caved under political pressure : \u201c The president told the kids at Parkland , \u2018 I \u2019 ll go strong on this , I \u2019 ll work on this age thing , \u2019 \u201d Smith said . \u201c And then he met with the NRA. \u201d Smith \u2019 s treatment of these stories\u2014and how that treatment differs from his opinion-host colleagues \u2019 \u2014hasn \u2019 t gone unnoticed . Hannity , who wove the Uranium One scandal into his ongoing saga of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s mendacity , has called Smith \u201c so anti-Trump . \u201d\nSmith says he \u2019 s unbothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox \u2019 s opinion slate . \u201c We serve different masters . We work for different reporting chains , we have different rules . They don \u2019 t really have rules on the opinion side . They can say whatever they want . If it \u2019 s their opinion . I don \u2019 t really watch a lot of opinion programming . I \u2019 m busy. \u201d He laughs , enigmatic punctuation that may indicate he \u2019 d been trying for a bon mot , or might just be a Mississippi-nice way of indicating he \u2019 s said what he \u2019 s going to say , bless my heart .\nBut Smith isn \u2019 t kidding when he says he \u2019 s busy . He has his hour and leads the unit of 17 staffers that breaks into coverage when major news occurs . He \u2019 s the person Fox News viewers see during a hurricane , or a school shooting . \u201c I \u2019 ve been telling people about what \u2019 s happening for a long , long , long time , \u201d Smith says . He takes a long and considered pause . \u201c I know that when something big happens , people turn to us . I think people always will . People who maybe aren \u2019 t with us all the time who aren \u2019 t regular watchers , maybe there is some sort of confusion about what \u2019 s opinion and what \u2019 s news , but I think our audience understands the difference and comes to us when they need us . \u201d\nUnlike some portion of the audience that reflexively switches on Fox News , Smith is disengaged by politics . \u201c I get it , \u201d he says , \u201c that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining . I get that . I don \u2019 t work there . I wouldn \u2019 t work there . I don \u2019 t want to sit around and yell at each other and talk about your philosophy and my philosophy . That sounds horrible to me. \u201d He cites his values growing up : \u201c You don \u2019 t talk about your money , you don \u2019 t talk about your politics , and you don \u2019 t talk about your sex . Right now , everyone wants to talk about those things , and I \u2019 m not one of them . Not going to do it . \u201d\nThis becomes clear in our first meeting when I broach his personal life ; Smith , who \u2019 d been dogged by rumors for much of his career , publicly acknowledged he is gay in 2017 . \u201c I think that \u2019 s the part you like , \u201d he shoots back when I ask if his boyfriend of six years works in the news business . Some of the honey drips away from his drawl . \u201c I don \u2019 t mind talking about it . It \u2019 s just , you know , that \u2019 s just my personal life . And I \u2019 m not hiding anything . I have a longtime boyfriend and we \u2019 re as happy as we can be and we live a very normal life and go to dinner and go to games and see his family and see my family . It \u2019 s great for us . But I can \u2019 t imagine anyone else finding it interesting . \u201d\nSmith isn \u2019 t the only anchor to profess a desire to avoid becoming the story , but his commitment to facts over feeling makes him an unusual fit for an era defined by news personalities . His opinion colleagues , geared to thrive in contentious times , fit the tenor of the moment more naturally . That he \u2019 s , to some portion of the Fox audience , become despised for telling them what they don \u2019 t want to hear is a frustrating part of the job . \u201c It depends on what you \u2019 re looking for , \u201d he says . \u201c Are you looking for news and information so that you can make decisions about your life and your family ? Or are you looking for your worldview to be confirmed ? For that second kind of viewer , when the facts fly in the face of your worldview , that can be unsettling . Sometimes , then , they don \u2019 t like me . And there are other times when the facts work beautifully with their worldview . Then , they \u2019 re very happy . \u201d\nFrom its earliest days , Fox News has dazzled with its commitment to showmanship , from glimmering studios to vervy transitions between stories to well-put-together anchors ( a role the trim , tan and neatly groomed Smith fits into tidily ) . Wallace sees the network \u2019 s main competition as the entertainment industry . \u201c People may turn on the network and get pissed at whoever \u2019 s on , but the storytelling that we have and the way that we break stories down is so important and compelling , they don \u2019 t leave , \u201d he says . \u201c And when they do leave , they \u2019 re probably going to turn on Netflix . \u201d\nWhat doesn \u2019 t show onscreen is just how much has changed since 2016 . The late Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign in July of that year for an alleged pattern of sexual assault in the workplace . ( He died in 2017 . ) Smith describes that period as \u201c the hardest time in my professional life . We were in Cleveland at the [ Republican ] Convention as our professional world was collapsing around us . We had become the news. \u201d The newsroom where researchers , reporters , and digital staff work was recently renovated with substantial input from 21st Century Fox and Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch . Completed only weeks before I visit , the revamp created an open office . The clear sightlines , with busy young reporters tapping away under various illuminated screens , is a powerful reminder of just what came before . Fox and other TV outlets were closed-door environments in which secrets could fester .\nFox News has been forced to grapple with systemic changes outside its doors , too . The network , which long prized a reputation earned in the Clinton era as a brash insurgent , is now the primary newsfeed for the President . Smith doesn \u2019 t know or profess to care if Trump watches his reporting . \u201c I have no idea . I hope not , I hope he \u2019 s busy . The president says he doesn \u2019 t have much time for television , I \u2019 ve heard him say that. \u201d Don \u2019 t we know Trump watches Fox \u2019 s morning opinion broadcast ? \u201c I know that he watches Fox & Friends in the morning , because he often tweets about it . But those aren \u2019 t the things I concern myself with . I try to find out what \u2019 s happening , as opposed to just listening to what they \u2019 re saying. \u201d Smith also shuts out the ascendant voices that have recently outflanked Fox \u2019 s opinion journalists on the right : Does he read the website Breitbart or listen to provocateur Alex Jones ? \u201c Nope , \u201d he says .\nBut many of the viewers he \u2019 s trying to reach do . And they \u2019 re not shy about their disapproval when Smith calls out a fiction . On my second visit to Smith \u2019 s studio , he alludes to this feedback : \u201c Wait \u2018 til you see your reader email after this piece. \u201d He leaves his show \u2019 s Twitter account to his team , but says he is aware of how strongly voiced the critiques are .\nDespite being the cable-news ratings leader , Fox News \u2019 audience is also old . The median Fox News viewer in 2017 was 65 overall , the same as MSNBC , and 66 in primetime , the highest of all cable news networks . \u201c I think that our audience skews conservative . We learn about our audience through research and data , \u201d says Smith . A 2014 study by Pew Research Center indicated Fox News was the most-trusted news source for \u201c consistently conservative \u201d viewers , edging out the Wall Street Journal , Breitbart , and the Drudge Report .\nSmith \u2019 s generally straight-news broadcast doesn \u2019 t frequently upset those viewers \u2019 senses of self . But breaking news has a way of shaking up established agendas . The day after my first visit was the day of the school shooting in Parkland , Fl . News of the incident broke as Smith was preparing to go to air . Once again , the pace of events scrambled a plan that was already pretty seat-of-pants . Smith took to the air for three hours , during which he listed the shootings and asked , \u201c Why can \u2019 t they put the best and the brightest together to research it and figure it out and help us stop it ? [ We \u2019 re ] failing our children . \u201d\nThe question resonated in part because Smith was , at that moment , the voice most widely heard . Perpetually ahead in the ratings , he was being watched by 3.3 million viewers in the 5 p.m. hour , compared to just under 1.6 million watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN . Smith \u2019 s critics , he says , told him that reading the list of schools was \u201c political . You \u2019 re making this political. \u201d Smith denies the charge : \u201c I guess , I know , that there are people who come at everything in a political way . I don \u2019 t . I \u2019 ve never really liked politics . I \u2019 ve always said that I thought politics in America was weird and creepy , and lacked a connection to reality . \u201d\nOn our first meeting , Smith had been energized : \u201c It \u2019 s more challenging , \u201d he says of reporting during the Trump presidency , \u201c and more challenging is more fun. \u201d On our second , he seemed depleted . Bringing up walking away from the news desk was less an idle threat and more of a contingency plan for coping with a different America . Describing the response he \u2019 s received lately , Smith says \u201c if we start making changes , if ratings go down or viewers scream too much and we make changes to accommodate , we are in extreme dereliction of duty . I can not do it . I will not do it . I \u2019 ll quit . I \u2019 ll stop doing it completely . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s decided to stay in some part because the times are so precarious . In his telling , before he signed his new contract , he was nervous about what would come on Fox \u2019 s air after he left . \u201c To stop doing it would be bad because I think that there is a need for it and I know the degree to which we care about it and focus on it and we want it to be as perfect as it can be . And I wonder , if I stopped delivering the facts , what would go in its place in this place that is most watched , most listened , most viewed , most trusted ? I don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nOn Smith \u2019 s primetime show , he used to do light stories from time to time . Wallace , the head of Fox News , noted that Smith is a weather obsessive : \u201c We were somewhere in L.A. and he told me some weird fact that there are 19 weather zones within two blocks in West Hollywood , and I was like , why do you know that worthless knowledge ? \u201d Asked to name one of Smith \u2019 s favorite stories , his executive producer Jon Glenn recalls the 2015 incident in which two llamas ran through suburban Phoenix . \u201c I know we \u2019 re all going through this whole long journey of politics , \u201d Glenn says , \u201c but look , there are some freaking llamas running down the street in Arizona ! \u201d\nSmith remembers this fondly too . \u201c We would try to be entertaining with them , because I always felt like you should get some dessert with the meal . That seems like an eternity ago. \u201d The people tuning into Fox and writing him emails and tweets don \u2019 t want dessert in the form of a cute story . More and more , they seem to crave red meat , an appetite that much on Fox News \u2019 air has helped to nurture . But Smith can \u2019 t brook shifting his reporting . \u201c I think we have to make the wall between news and opinion as high and as thick and as impenetrable as possible . And I try to do that . And if I were doing this , there would be a lot more fact-based reporting , but it \u2019 s available for people who want it . I don \u2019 t know how badly they want it . \u201d\nNow the pressures are greater , and the landscape is bleaker . Smith may still be seeing things he \u2019 d never expected , but they all tend to be on one beat . \u201c I miss doing that thing I used to do but I like this thing I \u2019 m doing now , \u201d he says . \u201c I just wish everyone weren \u2019 t so angry about it all . I wish that we could have lighter moments and not always be on guard with each other. \u201d Even as he signs on for years to come , a solution seems to Smith far away . \u201c We \u2019 re not living normal lives , \u201d he says . \u201c We \u2019 re ingesting a lot more than I think is healthy. \u201d Which means ? \u201c This isn \u2019 t going to just go away , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s going to get worse . \u201d",

Then, they\u2019re very happy.\u201d\n\nFrom its earliest days, Fox News has dazzled with its commitment to showmanship, from glimmering studios to vervy transitions between stories to well-put-together anchors (a role the trim, tan and neatly groomed Smith fits into tidily). Wallace sees the network\u2019s main competition as the entertainment industry. \u201cPeople may turn on the network and get pissed at whoever\u2019s on, but the storytelling that we have and the way that we break stories down is so important and compelling, they don\u2019t leave,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when they do leave, they\u2019re probably going to turn on Netflix.\u201d\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t show onscreen is just how much has changed since 2016. The late Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign in July of that year for an alleged pattern of sexual assault in the workplace. (He died in 2017.) Smith describes that period as \u201cthe hardest time in my professional life. We were in Cleveland at the [Republican] Convention as our professional world was collapsing around us. We had become the news.\u201d The newsroom where researchers, reporters, and digital staff work was recently renovated with substantial input from 21st Century Fox and Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Completed only weeks before I visit, the revamp created an open office. The clear sightlines, with busy young reporters tapping away under various illuminated screens, is a powerful reminder of just what came before. Fox and other TV outlets were closed-door environments in which secrets could fester.\n\nAndres Kudacki for TIME\n\nFox News has been forced to grapple with systemic changes outside its doors, too. The network, which long prized a reputation earned in the Clinton era as a brash insurgent, is now the primary newsfeed for the President. Smith doesn\u2019t know or profess to care if Trump watches his reporting. \u201cI have no idea. I hope not, I hope he\u2019s busy. The president says he doesn\u2019t have much time for television, I\u2019ve heard him say that.\u201d Don\u2019t we know Trump watches Fox\u2019s morning opinion broadcast? \u201cI know that he watches Fox & Friends in the morning, because he often tweets about it. But those aren\u2019t the things I concern myself with. I try to find out what\u2019s happening, as opposed to just listening to what they\u2019re saying.\u201d Smith also shuts out the ascendant voices that have recently outflanked Fox\u2019s opinion journalists on the right: Does he read the website Breitbart or listen to provocateur Alex Jones? \u201cNope,\u201d he says.\n\nBut many of the viewers he\u2019s trying to reach do. And they\u2019re not shy about their disapproval when Smith calls out a fiction. On my second visit to Smith\u2019s studio, he alludes to this feedback: \u201cWait \u2018til you see your reader email after this piece.\u201d He leaves his show\u2019s Twitter account to his team, but says he is aware of how strongly voiced the critiques are.\n\nDespite being the cable-news ratings leader, Fox News\u2019 audience is also old. The median Fox News viewer in 2017 was 65 overall, the same as MSNBC, and 66 in primetime, the highest of all cable news networks. \u201cI think that our audience skews conservative. We learn about our audience through research and data,\u201d says Smith. A 2014 study by Pew Research Center indicated Fox News was the most-trusted news source for \u201cconsistently conservative\u201d viewers, edging out the Wall Street Journal, Breitbart, and the Drudge Report.\n\nSmith\u2019s generally straight-news broadcast doesn\u2019t frequently upset those viewers\u2019 senses of self. But breaking news has a way of shaking up established agendas. The day after my first visit was the day of the school shooting in Parkland, Fl. News of the incident broke as Smith was preparing to go to air. Once again, the pace of events scrambled a plan that was already pretty seat-of-pants. Smith took to the air for three hours, during which he listed the shootings and asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t they put the best and the brightest together to research it and figure it out and help us stop it? [We\u2019re] failing our children.\u201d\n\nThe question resonated in part because Smith was, at that moment, the voice most widely heard. Perpetually ahead in the ratings, he was being watched by 3.3 million viewers in the 5 p.m. hour, compared to just under 1.6 million watching Wolf Blitzer on CNN. Smith\u2019s critics, he says, told him that reading the list of schools was \u201c political. You\u2019re making this political.\u201d Smith denies the charge: \u201cI guess, I know, that there are people who come at everything in a political way. I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never really liked politics. I\u2019ve always said that I thought politics in America was weird and creepy, and lacked a connection to reality.\u201d\n\nOn our first meeting, Smith had been energized: \u201cIt\u2019s more challenging,\u201d he says of reporting during the Trump presidency, \u201cand more challenging is more fun.\u201d On our second, he seemed depleted. Bringing up walking away from the news desk was less an idle threat and more of a contingency plan for coping with a different America. Describing the response he\u2019s received lately, Smith says \u201cif we start making changes, if ratings go down or viewers scream too much and we make changes to accommodate, we are in extreme dereliction of duty. I cannot do it. I will not do it. I\u2019ll quit. I\u2019ll stop doing it completely.\u201d\n\nAndres Kudacki for TIME\n\nHe\u2019s decided to stay in some part because the times are so precarious. In his telling, before he signed his new contract, he was nervous about what would come on Fox\u2019s air after he left. \u201cTo stop doing it would be bad because I think that there is a need for it and I know the degree to which we care about it and focus on it and we want it to be as perfect as it can be. And I wonder, if I stopped delivering the facts, what would go in its place in this place that is most watched, most listened, most viewed, most trusted? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOn Smith\u2019s primetime show, he used to do light stories from time to time. Wallace, the head of Fox News, noted that Smith is a weather obsessive: \u201cWe were somewhere in L.A. and he told me some weird fact that there are 19 weather zones within two blocks in West Hollywood, and I was like, why do you know that worthless knowledge?\u201d Asked to name one of Smith\u2019s favorite stories, his executive producer Jon Glenn recalls the 2015 incident in which two llamas ran through suburban Phoenix. \u201cI know we\u2019re all going through this whole long journey of politics,\u201d Glenn says, \u201cbut look, there are some freaking llamas running down the street in Arizona!\u201d\n\nSmith remembers this fondly too. \u201cWe would try to be entertaining with them, because I always felt like you should get some dessert with the meal. That seems like an eternity ago.\u201d The people tuning into Fox and writing him emails and tweets don\u2019t want dessert in the form of a cute story. More and more, they seem to crave red meat, an appetite that much on Fox News\u2019 air has helped to nurture. But Smith can\u2019t brook shifting his reporting. \u201cI think we have to make the wall between news and opinion as high and as thick and as impenetrable as possible. And I try to do that. And if I were doing this, there would be a lot more fact-based reporting, but it\u2019s available for people who want it. I don\u2019t know how badly they want it.\u201d\n\nNow the pressures are greater, and the landscape is bleaker. Smith may still be seeing things he\u2019d never expected, but they all tend to be on one beat. \u201cI miss doing that thing I used to do but I like this thing I\u2019m doing now,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wish everyone weren\u2019t so angry about it all. I wish that we could have lighter moments and not always be on guard with each other.\u201d Even as he signs on for years to come, a solution seems to Smith far away. \u201cWe\u2019re not living normal lives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re ingesting a lot more than I think is healthy.\u201d Which means? \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to just go away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",
