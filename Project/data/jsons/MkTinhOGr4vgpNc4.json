    "content": "A transgender Texan child will live in joint custody with her two divorced parents\u2014one who believes she \u2019 s a girl and one who believes she \u2019 s a boy , a judge ruled Thursday .\nOn its face , Thursday \u2019 s court ruling between Texan exes Jeffrey Younger and Anne Georgulas is the last step in a child custody battle . But Younger and Georgulas \u2019 legal fight over one of their children has made the case a rallying point for conservatives , and Thursday \u2019 s decision comes after a slew of prominent politicians waded into the case and picked sides . Georgulas , who was awarded sole custody earlier this month , says her 7-year-old daughter Luna is transgender . Younger , who appealed the ruling and won a surprise victory on Thursday , says the child is not transgender , and is a male named James .\nAlthough the Thursday ruling only dictated who got custody and a say in the child \u2019 s medical decisions , it \u2019 s widely seen as a win for conservative media and politicians who have framed the case as a debate over how ( or if ) children can come out as transgender .\nLuna was assigned male at birth , but began indicating an interest in identifying as a girl when she was as young as three , her father claims . Three mental health professionals who evaluated Luna diagnosed her with gender dysphoria , a condition in which a person \u2019 s assigned sex at birth does not match their gender identity . In a 2018 ruling , a judge ordered both parents to treat Luna in a manner consistent with how she had previously identified in school , where she went by Luna and identified as a girl . ( For this reason , The \u2588\u2588\u2588 is referring to Luna with she/her pronouns , even though she is identified otherwise in other media . )\nNeither Younger nor a representative for Georgulas returned a request for comment on Thursday .\nYounger and Georgulas separated in 2015 . In marriage annulment proceedings , a court awarded Georgulas more than $ 45,000 in damages for a truck Younger fraudulently purchased in his name through her company . Georgulas also accused Younger of fabricating his background before they married . Before Georgulas married him , she said , Younger told her he had been married once , had a significant career in the Marines and served in Iraq , was a professor , and had made six-figure incomes for decades working for Fortune 500 companies . In fact , he had been married twice , did not have a college degree , was briefly a Marine before being removed , and only earned six figures once , in 2000 .\nA court annulled their marriage in 2016 . But even before the formal split , the pair was divided over how to treat their children . Although Luna \u2019 s twin brother continued to identify as male , Luna began indicating a preference for girls \u2019 clothes and identifying with female characters as early as her third birthday , Younger claimed on his blog .\nGeorgulas had Luna evaluated by three mental health professionals who diagnosed her with gender dysphoria , the Texan reported . One of those therapists advised Georgulas on gender affirmation practices . They would not medically intervene with Luna , but would allow her to dress and otherwise identify as a girl . She went by Luna in school , where she presented as female , according to court records .\nThis kind of non-medical transition is typical for children , said Casey Pick , senior fellow for advocacy and government affairs for The Trevor Project , a crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ young people .\n\u201c For children this age experiencing gender dysphoria , parents typically work together with mental health professionals to facilitate a social transition , which can include things like a change in hairstyle or clothing , use of a different name or pronouns , and being socially affirmed in their gender identity , \u201d Pick told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBut Younger insisted Luna was not transgender , and continued to refer to her as \u201c James. \u201d He launched a website , \u201c SaveJames , \u201d where he argued Georgulas had fabricated Luna \u2019 s gender identity . The site currently solicits donations and accuses Georgulas of \u201c abusing \u201d their child . ( Georgulas previously accused Younger of domestic violence , of which he was acquitted in 2018 . )\nYounger uploaded videos of Luna in boys \u2019 clothes , and stated that the child presented as a boy while visiting Younger \u2019 s house . Those visits became increasingly charged . The parents were split on longer-lasting decisions , like whether to cut Luna \u2019 s hair . A judge ruled that she should maintain a haircut that was reasonable for a boy or girl , but Georgulas accused Younger of repeatedly cutting it very short during visits .\nOn his website , Younger claims not to be \u201c against \u201d transgender people , but language across the site repeatedly borrows anti-trans tropes . He wrote that he opposes \u201c irreversible \u201d hormone treatments . A dossier on the case available on his website refers to \u201c this crazy transgender world , \u201d and he repeatedly refers to gender-affirming treatments as \u201c chemical castration. \u201d ( As experts told the Washington Post , transgender children can take hormone blockers during puberty , although these are not irreversible . )\nRather than practicing gender-affirming behavior now , Younger said he preferred the tactic of \u201c watchful waiting , \u201d which social work professor Katherine Kuvalanka told the Post was \u201c outdated \u201d and could be actively harmful if a parent did not accept the child \u2019 s gender identity .\nAs the custody case moved toward trial earlier this year , it featured increasingly in conservative media , which portrayed it as a case of LGBT rights run amok . Some of the media fallout targeted Georgulas . Conservative blogs and social media users accused her of wanting to \u201c mutilate \u201d her child , a common allegation in anti-trans circles . A Facebook group with a graphically violent name circulated what they claimed was Georgulas \u2019 address and phone number , and encouraged people to leave negative reviews for the office where she works as a pediatrician .\nStories involving transgender children can sometimes be used to present transgender people as a risk to others , Pick said .\n\u201c We should never forget that these stories , much as they are often framed as part of a broader culture war , are ultimately about individuals and families who are trying to do the best they can , \u201d she said . \u201c There is no reason to doubt that both of Luna \u2019 s parents love her very much . That said , too often we see transgender children framed by anti-transgender advocates as a threat to other children or society , and when that happens , it has a negative effect on the self-worth and health of LGBTQ youth across the country . \u201d\nA survey by the Trevor Project this year found that 78 percent of transgender and non-binary youth reported facing discrimination over their gender identity .\nEarlier this week , a jury ruled 11-1 to give Georgulas sole custody .
