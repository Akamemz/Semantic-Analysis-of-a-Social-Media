I believe an African American senator can beat Trump . I believe a western governor , a female senator , a member of Congress , a Latino Texan or a former vice-president can beat Trump , \u201d said Jon Cowan , president of Third Way , hours before Donald Trump formally launched his re-election campaign with a rally in Orlando , Florida , on Tuesday .\n\u201c But I don \u2019 t believe a self-described democratic socialist can win . \u201d\nI don \u2019 t believe a self-described democratic socialist can win Jon Cowan\nIn speeches and on panels over the course of two sticky days in Charleston earlier this week , moderate lawmakers , strategists and donors inveighed against the Vermont senator \u2019 s populist economic vision . The approach elevated a conversation that has largely taken place behind closed doors about how to thwart Sanders , who moderates believe would alienate crucial voting blocs in a general election .\n\u201c He has made it his mission to either get the nomination or to remake the party in his image as a democratic socialist , \u201d Cowan told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c That is an existential threat to the future of the Democratic party for the next generation . \u201d\nSanders \u2013 who maintains his political identity as an independent\u2013 has made it clear he intends to run against the Democratic establishment even as he seeks the party \u2019 s nomination . Third Way \u2019 s public criticism of the senator , days before the first presidential primary debates next week , reflects sharp new dividing lines in the battle for control of the party .\n\u201c The cat is out of the bag , \u201d Sanders tweeted on Wednesday , sharing a Politico story about how mainstream Democrats are warming to Elizabeth Warren , his closest ideological ally . \u201c The corporate wing of the Democratic party is publicly \u2018 anybody but Bernie \u2019 . \u201d\nHis campaign manager , Faiz Shakir , said in a statement that the party \u2019 s moderate faction had effectively \u201c declared war on Senator Sanders \u201d and denounced Third Way as a \u201c Washington thinktank that takes Wall Street money . \u201d\nSanders and his allies believe that the Democratic party \u2019 s turn toward corporatism led to Trump \u2019 s rise and that the theory of political electability advanced by group \u2019 s like Third Way is no match for the mood of the electorate in a populist moment .\nAs Democrats becomes more liberal , their views on socialism , especially among young people , are warming . Earlier this month at a party event in California earlier this month , the Democratic hopeful John Hickenlooper was booed by the audience for saying socialism is \u201c not the answer \u201d .\nBernie Sanders ( @ BernieSanders ) The cat is out of the bag . The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly `` anybody but Bernie . '' They know our progressive agenda of Medicare for All , breaking up big banks , taking on drug companies and raising wages is the real threat to the billionaire class . https : //t.co/zimci7JRO6\nBut after more than two years of standing by as the party \u2019 s progressive faction flexed its newfound power , moderates again feel ascendant . Emboldened by the results of the 2018 midterm elections , which saw pragmatic Democrats win in dozens of Republican-held districts to deliver a majority in the House of Representatives , they are increasingly vocal in their disdain for socialism \u2013 and Sanders .\nBut the question of how to constrain Sanders is complicated . In 2016 , Trump defeated a wide field of more experienced and more qualified candidates with a populist message that appealed to the right \u2019 s anti-establishment anger . In a race with a similarly large field of candidates , Sanders enters with far more advantages than Trump did : the Vermont senator is both experienced and qualified , with a dedicated following , a prodigious small-dollar fundraising operation , a developed economic platform and a populist appeal that surges when he is attacked by the political establishment he ran against to great effect in 2016 .\nTrump and Republicans continue to hurl the socialism label at the Democrat field . On Tuesday night , Trump warned in a speech formally launching his re-election campaign : \u201c A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream . \u201d\nNone of Sanders \u2019 s 23 competitors have embraced the democratic socialism label . Warren , who is nipping at his heels in some recent polls , distinguishes herself as a capitalist .\nAttitudes toward socialism are shifting in the US . Recent surveys have found that young people and women associate socialism with European countries rather than Soviet Russia . Yet socialism remains broadly unpopular : less than half of American voters say they would vote for a \u201c qualified presidential candidate who is a socialist \u201d , according to a Gallup poll released in May .\nThe mood at the conference vacillated from nervous optimism to nervous pessimism about Democrats \u2019 prospects for beating Trump in 2020 .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t nominate a self-proclaimed socialist , we \u2019 ll probably be OK , \u201d said Jen Psaki , who was White House communications director under Obama . \u201c I hope so . \u201d\nBut the former North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp , who lost re-election in 2018 , warned that Democrats would continue to lose the White House and the US Senate unless the party makes inroads with rural voters .\nIf we don \u2019 t nominate a self-proclaimed socialist , we \u2019 ll probably be OK Jen Psaki\n\u201c We have stopped talking to the middle of the country , \u201d said Heitkamp , who launched One Country Project that seeks to \u201c re-engage rural America \u201d . \u201c People feel like we \u2019 ve abandoned the bread-and-butter issues , and people in rural America feel it more accutely . \u201d\nEmphasizing her point , she said that if farmers from her state were asked to name the three biggest problems in rural America , \u201c not one would say : antitrust \u201d .\nDuring the final panel of the day , Jim Messina , Obama \u2019 s 2012 campaign manager , predicted the 2020 election will be extremely close .\n\u201c We could be sitting on election day not knowing who will win , \u201d he said .\nSeveral speakers urged those in the room to \u201c get off Twitter \u201d and venture into the real world , where far fewer Democrats are engaged in \u201c faculty lounge debates over political ideology \u201d .\n\u201c There is a potential that the hyper-hyper-engaged \u2013 the extremely online voters that are paying attention right now \u2013 might be able to drive the direction of the campaigns , \u201d said Lanae Erickson , a senior vice-president at Third Way .\nShe presented a poll conducted by the thinktank that found only one in 10 Democratic primary voters tweet regularly .
