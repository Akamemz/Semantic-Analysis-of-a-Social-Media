    "content": "In June , 2006 , Donald Trump taped an episode of his reality-television show , \u201c The Apprentice , \u201d at the Playboy Mansion , in Los Angeles . Hugh Hefner , Playboy \u2019 s publisher , threw a pool party for the show \u2019 s contestants with dozens of current and former Playmates , including Karen McDougal , a slim brunette who had been named Playmate of the Year , eight years earlier . In 2001 , the magazine \u2019 s readers voted her runner-up for \u201c Playmate of the \u2019 90s , \u201d behind Pamela Anderson . At the time of the party , Trump had been married to the Slovenian model Melania Knauss for less than two years ; their son , Barron , was a few months old . Trump seemed uninhibited by his new family obligations . McDougal later wrote that Trump \u201c immediately took a liking to me , kept talking to me - telling me how beautiful I was , etc . It was so obvious that a Playmate Promotions exec said , \u2018 Wow , he was all over you - I think you could be his next wife. \u2019 \u201d Trump and McDougal began an affair , which McDougal later memorialized in an eight-page , handwritten document provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by John Crawford , a friend of McDougal \u2019 s . When I showed McDougal the document , she expressed surprise that I had obtained it but confirmed that the handwriting was her own . The interactions that McDougal outlines in the document share striking similarities with the stories of other women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump , or who have accused him of propositioning them for sex or sexually harassing them . McDougal describes their affair as entirely consensual . But her account provides a detailed look at how Trump and his allies used clandestine hotel-room meetings , payoffs , and complex legal agreements to keep affairs\u2014sometimes multiple affairs he carried out simultaneously\u2014out of the press . On November 4 , 2016 , four days before the election , the Wall Street Journal reported that American Media , Inc. , the publisher of the National Enquirer , had paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for exclusive rights to McDougal \u2019 s story , which it never ran . Purchasing a story in order to bury it is a practice that many in the tabloid industry call \u201c catch and kill. \u201d This is a favorite tactic of the C.E.O . and chairman of A.M.I. , David Pecker , who describes the President as \u201c a personal friend. \u201d As part of the agreement , A.M.I . consented to publish a regular aging-and-fitness column by McDougal . After Trump won the Presidency , however , A.M.I. \u2019 s promises largely went unfulfilled , according to McDougal . Last month , the Journal reported that Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer had negotiated a separate agreement just before the election with an adult-film actress named Stephanie Clifford , whose screen name is Stormy Daniels , which barred her from discussing her own affair with Trump . Since then , A.M.I . has repeatedly approached McDougal about extending her contract . McDougal , in her first on-the-record comments about A.M.I. \u2019 s handling of her story , declined to discuss the details of her relationship with Trump , for fear of violating the agreement she reached with the company . She did say , however , that she regretted signing the contract . \u201c It took my rights away , \u201d McDougal told me . \u201c At this point I feel I can \u2019 t talk about anything without getting into trouble , because I don \u2019 t know what I \u2019 m allowed to talk about . I \u2019 m afraid to even mention his name. \u201d A White House spokesperson said in a statement that Trump denies having had an affair with McDougal : \u201c This is an old story that is just more fake news . The President says he never had a relationship with McDougal. \u201d A.M.I . said that an amendment to McDougal \u2019 s contract\u2014signed after Trump won the election\u2014allowed her to \u201c respond to legitimate press inquiries \u201d regarding the affair . The company said that it did not print the story because it did not find it credible . Six former A.M.I . employees told me that Pecker routinely makes catch-and-kill arrangements like the one reached with McDougal . \u201c We had stories and we bought them knowing full well they were never going to run , \u201d Jerry George , a former A.M.I . senior editor who worked at the company for more than twenty-five years , told me . George said that Pecker protected Trump . \u201c Pecker really considered him a friend , \u201d George told me . \u201c We never printed a word about Trump without his approval. \u201d Maxine Page , who worked at A.M.I . on and off from 2002 to 2012 , including as an executive editor at one of the company \u2019 s Web sites , said that Pecker also used the unpublished stories as \u201c leverage \u201d over some celebrities in order to pressure them to pose for his magazines or feed him stories . Several former employees said that these celebrities included Arnold Schwarzenegger , as reported by Los Angeles Magazine , and Tiger Woods . ( Schwarzenegger , through an attorney , denied this claim . Woods did not respond to requests for comment . ) \u201c Even though they \u2019 re just tabloids , just rags , it \u2019 s still a cause of concern , \u201d Page said . \u201c In theory , you would think that Trump has all the power in that relationship , but in fact Pecker has the power\u2014he has the power to run these stories . He knows where the bodies are buried . \u201d\nAs the pool party at the Playboy Mansion came to an end , Trump asked for McDougal \u2019 s telephone number . For McDougal , who grew up in a small town in Michigan and worked as a preschool teacher before beginning her modelling career , such advances were not unusual . John Crawford , McDougal \u2019 s friend , who also helped broker her deal with A.M.I. , said that Trump was \u201c another powerful guy hitting on her , a gal who \u2019 s paid to be at work. \u201d Trump and McDougal began talking frequently on the phone , and soon had what McDougal described as their first date : dinner in a private bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel . McDougal wrote that Trump impressed her . \u201c I was so nervous ! I was into his intelligence + charm . Such a polite man , \u201d she wrote . \u201c We talked for a couple hours \u2013 then , it was \u201c ON \u201d ! We got naked + had sex. \u201d As McDougal was getting dressed to leave , Trump did something that surprised her . \u201c He offered me money , \u201d she wrote . \u201c I looked at him ( + felt sad ) + said , \u2018 No thanks - I \u2019 m not \u2018 that girl. \u2019 I slept w/you because I like you - NOT for money \u2019 - He told me \u2018 you are special. \u2019 \u201d Afterward , McDougal wrote , she \u201c went to see him every time he was in LA ( which was a lot ) . \u201d Trump , she said , always stayed in the same bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel and ordered the same meal\u2014steak and mashed potatoes\u2014and never drank . McDougal \u2019 s account is consistent with other descriptions of Trump \u2019 s behavior . Last month , In Touch Weekly published an interview conducted in 2011 with Stephanie Clifford in which she revealed that during a relationship with Trump she met him for dinner at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel , where Trump insisted they watch \u201c Shark Week \u201d on the Discovery Channel . Summer Zervos , a former contestant on \u201c The Apprentice , \u201d alleged that Trump assaulted her at a private dinner meeting , in December of 2007 , at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel . Trump , Zervos has claimed , kissed her , groped her breast , and suggested that they lie down to \u201c watch some telly-telly. \u201d After Zervos rebuffed Trump \u2019 s advances , she said that he \u201c began thrusting his genitals \u201d against her . ( Zervos recently sued Trump for defamation after he denied her account . ) All three women say that they were escorted to a bungalow at the hotel by a Trump bodyguard , whom two of the women have identified as Keith Schiller . After Trump was elected , Schiller was appointed director of Oval Office Operations and deputy assistant to the President . Last September , John Kelly , acting as the new chief of staff , removed Schiller from the White House posts . ( Schiller did not respond to a request for comment . ) Over the course of the affair , Trump flew McDougal to public events across the country but hid the fact that he paid for her travel . \u201c No paper trails for him , \u201d she wrote . \u201c In fact , every time I flew to meet him , I booked/paid for flight + hotel + he reimbursed me. \u201d In July , 2006 , McDougal joined Trump at the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship , at the Edgewood Resort , on Lake Tahoe . At a party there , she and Trump sat in a booth with the New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees , and Trump told her that Brees had recognized her , remarking , \u201c Baby , you \u2019 re popular. \u201d ( Brees , through a spokesman , denied meeting Trump or McDougal at the event . ) At another California golf event , Trump told McDougal that Tiger Woods had asked who she was . Trump , she recalled , warned her \u201c to stay away from that one , LOL. \u201d During the Lake Tahoe tournament , McDougal and Trump had sex , she wrote . He also allegedly began a sexual relationship with Clifford at the event . ( A representative for Clifford did not respond to requests for comment . ) In the 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly , Clifford said that Trump didn \u2019 t use a condom and didn \u2019 t mention sleeping with anyone else . Another adult-film actress , whose screen name is Alana Evans , claimed that Trump invited her to join them in his hotel room that weekend . A third adult-film performer , known as Jessica Drake , alleged that Trump asked her to his hotel room , met her and two women she brought with her in pajamas , and then \u201c grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking for permission. \u201d He then offered Drake ten thousand dollars in exchange for her company . ( Trump denied the incident . ) A week after the golf tournament , McDougal joined Trump at the fifty-fifth Miss Universe contest , in Los Angeles . She sat near him , and later attended an after-party where she met celebrities . Trump also set aside tickets for Clifford , as he did at a later vodka launch that both women attended . During Trump \u2019 s relationship with McDougal , she wrote , he introduced her to members of his family and took her to his private residences . At a January , 2007 , launch party in Los Angeles for Trump \u2019 s now-defunct liquor brand , Trump Vodka , McDougal , who was photographed entering the event , recalled sitting at a table with Kim Kardashian , Trump , Donald Trump , Jr. , and Trump , Jr. , \u2019 s wife , Vanessa , who was pregnant . At one point , Trump held a party for \u201c The Apprentice \u201d at the Playboy Mansion , and McDougal worked as a costumed Playboy bunny . \u201c We took pics together , alone + with his family , \u201d McDougal wrote . She recalled that Trump said he had asked his son Eric \u201c who he thought was the most beautiful girl here + Eric pointed me . Mr. T said \u2018 He has great taste \u2019 + we laughed ! \u201d Trump gave McDougal tours of Trump Tower and his Bedminster , New Jersey , golf club . In Trump Tower , McDougal wrote , Trump pointed out Melania \u2019 s separate bedroom . He \u201c said she liked her space , \u201d McDougal wrote , \u201c to read or be alone. \u201d McDougal \u2019 s account , like those of Clifford and other women who have described Trump \u2019 s advances , conveys a man preoccupied with his image . McDougal recalled that Trump would often send her articles about him or his daughter , as well as signed books and sun visors from his golf courses . Clifford recalled Trump remarking that she and Ivanka were similar and proudly showing her a copy of a \u201c money magazine \u201d with his image on the cover . Trump also promised to buy McDougal an apartment in New York as a Christmas present . Clifford , likewise , said that Trump promised to buy her a condo in Tampa . For Trump , showing off real estate and other branded products was sometimes a prelude to sexual advances . Zervos and a real-estate investor named Rachel Crooks have both claimed that Trump kissed them on the mouth during professional encounters at Trump Tower . Four other women have claimed that Trump forcibly touched or kissed them during tours or events at Mar-a-Lago , his property in Palm Beach , Florida . ( Trump has denied any wrongdoing pertaining to the women . ) McDougal ended the relationship in April , 2007 , after nine months . According to Crawford , the breakup was prompted in part by McDougal \u2019 s feelings of guilt . \u201c She couldn \u2019 t look at herself in the mirror anymore , \u201d Crawford said . \u201c And she was concerned about what her mother thought of her. \u201d The decision was reinforced by a series of comments Trump made that McDougal found disrespectful , according to several of her friends . When she raised her concern about her mother \u2019 s disapproval to Trump , he replied , \u201c What , that old hag ? \u201d ( McDougal , hurt , pointed out that Trump and her mother were close in age . ) On the night of the Miss Universe pageant McDougal attended , McDougal and a friend rode with Trump in his limousine and the friend mentioned a relationship she had had with an African-American man . According to multiple sources , Trump remarked that the friend liked \u201c the big black dick \u201d and began commenting on her attractiveness and breast size . The interactions angered the friend and deeply offended McDougal . Speaking carefully for fear of legal reprisal , McDougal responded to questions about whether she felt guilty about the affair , as her friends suggested , by saying that she had found God in the last several years and regretted parts of her past . \u201c This is a new me , \u201d she told me . \u201c If I could go back and do a lot of things differently , I definitely would . \u201d",
