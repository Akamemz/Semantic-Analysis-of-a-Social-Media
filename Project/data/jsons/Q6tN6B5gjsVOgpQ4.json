    "content": "The bombshell Donald Trump video that surfaced Friday has so dramatically altered expectations for Sunday \u2019 s town hall debate that one Democrat close to Bill and Hillary Clinton had a new view of what may unfold in St. Louis : \u201c Expect Armageddon . \u201d\nHillary Clinton will arrive at the Washington University debate stage Sunday prepped for battle against an opponent many of her allies believe has already lost the election .\nTrump , in contrast , will walk onto the debate stage with nothing to lose .\nTwo days after a tape surfaced of the reality television star bragging in obscene terms about groping and kissing women without consent , and a day after unprecedented defections of support and calls for his withdrawal from leaders of his own party , the second debate now falls at the most precipitous moment in the election .\nThat puts Clinton in a more precarious position on the debate stage . \u201c I think that Trump will figure he \u2019 s got nothing to lose , so he might as well go all out , \u201d said the Democrat close to the Clintons .\nLongtime Democratic strategist Robert Shrum , who guided the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry , said that \u201c to the extent that he has any chance left at all \u2014 and I don \u2019 t think he does \u2014 this debate is do or die for him . Her goal is to do no harm and relate to voters . \u201d\nA Clinton campaign official on Saturday said the Democratic nominee plans to address the bombshell Trump tape head-on for the first time from the debate stage \u2014 and that the campaign went dark on Saturday in order to capitalize on one of the biggest audiences available with 30 days left of the race , tuned in to hear her response .\nBut in debate prep sessions in the week leading up to the debate , Clinton aides were urging the Democratic nominee to remain focused on the real people posing questions in the town hall forum , rather than engage in an ugly back and forth with Trump . The goal , they said , should be to show off the caring , connecting , maternal side of Clinton that voters are less familiar with than the steely war horse who endured an 11-hour Benghazi hearing last fall .\nBut the weekend \u2019 s events have upended any expectation of a normal debate . In a video statement released late Friday night , Trump said that \u201c Bill Clinton has actually abused women , and Hillary Clinton has bullied , attacked , shamed and intimidated his victims . We will discuss this more in the coming days . \u201d\nOn Saturday evening , Trump previewed his nothing-to-lose strategy \u2014 he retweeted Juanita Broaddrick , the woman who accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978 . Bill Clinton has denied the accusation , which Broaddrick made in 1999 , in the wake of his affair with Monica Lewinsky .\nClinton was also preparing to respond to questions about her paid Wall Street speeches , which emerged on WikiLeaks after campaign chairman John Podesta \u2019 s emails were hacked . In one line , she stressed the importance of having a \u201c public and private position \u201d on contentious political issues . A source familiar with her debate prep said she plans to dismiss any scrutiny of the leaked excerpts from her speech as no different from what she has said in public .\nBut many Democratic allies predicted that bringing up Bill Clinton \u2019 s sex scandals only paints his wife in a sympathetic position , as someone who has struggled and suffered to keep her family together as a unit . Even if Trump argues that she disparaged the women who allegedly engaged in affairs with her husband , they said , many voters will see her through the lens of a hurt wife lashing out .\nBut a down-in-the-gutter conversation about sex and speeches is still not how the Clinton campaign would like to spend 90 minutes in prime time , with millions of viewers tuned in .\n\u201c The challenge , and the opportunity , will be to connect with people in a visceral and not simply a programmatic way , \u201d said David Axelrod , a former senior strategist for President Barack Obama . \u201c The danger is that she could overplay the attacks in a forum in which her interaction with the questioners should be a primary focus . \u201d\n\u201c Voters identify with the citizens asking the questions , \u201d added longtime Clinton ally Paul Begala , who is working as an adviser to the Clinton-backing super PAC Priorities USA . \u201c I would bet my life that she talks about her 19-point plan on child care . What I \u2019 m wishing and praying for is , she makes a reference to the fact that she was a working mom . You \u2019 ve got to be more conversational . \u201d\nBefore Trump \u2019 s weekend massacre , Clinton \u2019 s aides were hoping the town hall set up would be an opportunity for the oft-obscured \u201c real Hillary \u201d to reveal herself .\nThey pointed to a moment last February in Las Vegas , when Clinton comforted an emotional 10-year-old Latina girl who said she feared her parents were going to be deported , as one of her finest moments on the trail . \u201c I \u2019 m going to do everything I can so you don \u2019 t have to be scared , \u201d Clinton told Karla Ortiz , wrapping her arm around the girl \u2019 s waist . \u201c Let me do the worrying , I \u2019 ll do all the worrying , is that a deal ? \u201d\nClinton aides often refer to the scene ( which occurred in a private meeting and was released by the campaign as a carefully produced television commercial ) as a prime example of the side of the Democratic nominee that voters don \u2019 t know exists .\nMore important than attacking Trump , Democratic allies said , was creating an \u201c Ortiz moment , \u201d which could give undecided voters a sense of something positive to vote for , not just someone to vote against .\nEven before the release of Trump \u2019 s profane tape , in which he talks of grabbing women by the \u201c pussy \u201d and trying to seduce a married woman by \u201c moving on her like a bitch , \u201d Clinton was entering the second debate surging in the polls . The FiveThirtyEight election forecast had boosted her chances of winning back up to 79.6 percent before the damaging Trump tape release , and a new Quinnipiac University poll released Friday morning showed Clinton leading Trump nationally by 5 points .\nThat lead has given some of her longtime aides pause : if the past is prelude , this is exactly when Clinton chokes .\n\u201c She has , historically been a really horrible front-runner , \u201d conceded one veteran of her 2008 campaign . \u201c She \u2019 s extremely cautious and risk-averse , and it causes her , ironically , to make mistakes. \u201d Another longtime aide added : `` Finishing the deal has been hard for her in many contexts . Nobody in her universe is fully confident until it \u2019 s actually over . \u201d\nBut the Trump tape changes the stakes . Clinton has never in her long career been this close to the finish line . And she has never had an opponent falling apart because of his aggressive and disparaging remarks about women : She now also has the opportunity to stand as a powerful avatar for disgusted and depressed women across the country .\nIt \u2019 s a role she has , in the past , hesitated to play . In her presidential campaign eight years ago , Clinton downplayed her gender , often saying that she \u201c was not running as a woman \u201d but \u201c because I believe I am the best-qualified and experienced person . \u201d\nBut on Saturday , her campaign released a powerful 90-second video online , splicing Trump \u2019 s profane comments from the leaked video with other misogynistic statements he has made over the course of his campaign . \u201c Women have the power to stop Trump , \u201d Clinton \u2019 s campaign tweeted from the candidate \u2019 s official account , with a link to the Web video .\nThe official campaign Twitter account also tweeted a quote from Sen. Cory Booker : \u201c Sometimes the man in the arena , it ain \u2019 t a man . It is a woman . \u201d\nThe events of the weekend were a boon to Clinton \u2019 s campaign , but also required re-prepping . Clinton \u2019 s aides had been reviewing tape of Trump in town hall settings and video of his deposition from June , in order to prepare for a more toned-down version of the blustering real estate mogul .\nBut on Saturday , longtime Clinton allies said they expected Trump was more likely to use the debate as a last-ditch effort to save his candidacy \u2014 and if that did n't work , possibly get out of the race and turn it over to Mike Pence to defeat Clinton .\nThe campaign \u2019 s attorney , Marc Elias , and campaign manager Robby Mook were huddling Saturday to discuss that possibility , but Elias said that it was too late to replace Trump on state ballots and he would be the candidate , no matter what , on Election Day .\nTrump , meanwhile , was putting on a strong face , even in the wake of unprecedented defections from top GOP senators and party leaders .
