    "content": "Thousands gathered under gray skies in Washington , D.C. , on Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington .\nThey gathered in the exact same spot where the Rev . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his `` I Have a Dream '' speech , and many of the same themes \u2014 equality , dignity , unity \u2014 echoed through the crowd .\nPresident Obama was joined by the King family and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial .\nAt 3 p.m . ET. , they rang a bell that once hung in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham , Ala. , before the church was bombed weeks after the March on Washington . Today , the bell was a symbol of what the civil rights movement accomplished and the bloody price many paid for the fight .\nObama delivered a nuanced assessment of where King 's dream is today .\n`` To dismiss the magnitude of this progress \u2014 to suggest , as some sometimes do , that little has changed \u2014 that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years , '' Obama said . `` Medgar Evers , James Chaney , Andrew Goodman , Michael Schwerner , Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 they did not die in vain . Their victory was great .\n`` But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete . The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice , but it does n't bend on its own . To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance , not complacency . Whether by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote , or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all , and the criminal justice system is not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails , it requires vigilance . ''\nPresident Clinton , like Obama , said today we are at a crossroads .\nThe choice from 50 years ago , said Clinton , remains the same today : `` cooperate and thrive or fight with each other and fall behind . ''\nClinton said that Americans today owe a tremendous debt to `` those people who came here 50 years ago . '' Millions of us , said Clinton , have lived the dream King talked about .\nThe question , said Clinton , is how we will repay that debt ?\n`` Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear us complain , '' said Clinton . `` It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back . ''\n`` The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history ; that we are masters of our fate . But it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together . We 'll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling , the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago . `` And I believe that spirit is there , that truth force inside each of us . I see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child . I see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man . It 's there when the native-born recognizing that striving spirit of the new immigrant ; when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who are discriminated against and understands it as their own . `` That 's where courage comes from \u2014 when we turn not from each other , or on each other , but towards one another , and we find that we do not walk alone . That 's where courage comes from . ''\nWe live blogged the event . Keep reading for a play-by-play .\nUpdate at 3:34 p.m . ET . The Dream Of Every American :\nIn a speech that ran around 30 minutes , President Obama delivered a nuanced analysis of the progress of the Rev . Martin Luther King 's dream .\n`` To dismiss the magnitude of this progress , to suggest little has changed dishonors '' the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march , Obama said . But to say that everything is OK , also dishonors that legacy .\nObama opened his speech by reminding the crowd of the history of the march . It was n't just about ending oppression , Obama said , it was also about jobs .\nHe quoted MLK , saying what good is it for a man to be able to sit at a lunch counter , if he ca n't afford to pay the meal .\n`` It is along this second dimension \u2014 economic opportunity \u2014 that the dream has most fallen short , '' Obama said .\nAs Obama said , in his speech 50 years ago , King described the `` the dream of every American . '' He described the promise that was made 200 years earlier by the country 's founders : `` We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ''\nThe pursuit of happiness , said Obama , `` requires the dignity of work . ''\n`` We now have a choice . We can continue down our current path '' of growing income inequality or `` we can have the courage to change . ''\nAt about 3 p.m . ET , Bernice King , King 's daughter , said that today , `` we are going to let freedom ring . ''\nThe King family walked up to a bell saved after the Birmingham Baptist Church was bombed in 1963 and rang it . Across the country , churches joined in , ringing their bells in order to remember King .\nThe choice from 50 years ago , said President Bill Clinton , remains the same today : `` cooperate and thrive or fight with each other and fall behind . ''\nClinton said that Americans today owe a tremendous debt to `` those people who came here 50 years ago . '' Millions of us , said Clinton , have lived the dream King talked about .\nThe question , said Clinton , is how will we repay that debt ?\n`` Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear us complain , '' said Clinton . `` It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back . ''\nDr. King is `` the greatest leader my native state , and perhaps my native country has ever produced , '' former President Carter said .\nHe said that King 's dream is still not complete . He said `` we all know '' how Dr. King would feel at some voter ID laws , and at the Supreme Court ruling striking a key provision of the Voting Rights Act . `` We all know '' what Dr. King would think about the incredible unemployment rate , and incarceration rate of blacks .\n`` There 's a tremendous agenda before us , '' Carter said . `` I 'm thankful to Martin Luther King Jr. that his dream is still alive . ''\nRep. John Lewis , the Democratic congressman from Georgia , is now at the podium . Remember , Lewis was at 23 , the youngest speaker at the March on Washington , 50 years ago .\n`` We have come a long way in 50 years , but we have a long way to go before we can fulfill King 's dream , '' Lewis said .\nHe said we 've made progress : `` The signs that said white and black are gone ... but there are still invisible signs , '' Lewis said . `` The scars and stains of racism remain . ''\nNYPD 's Stop and Frisk program and the injustice in the case of Trayvon Martin are some examples .\nPresident Obama , along with first lady Michelle Obama and his predecessors , Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter walked down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and took their seats on stage .\nAs NPR 's Craig Windham told our Newscast unit , it 's an overcast day in Washington , but that did not stop thousands from gathering at the National Mall . Many told him , that they came to Washington , today , because they wanted to be part of history and because the struggle for civil rights is not over .\nTelevision mogul Oprah Winfrey reminded everyone that Martin Luther King Jr. `` challenged us to see how we are more alike than we are different . ''\nThat 's why as the bells toll at 3 p.m . ET. , `` we must recommit to the love that abides and connects each of us , and let freedom ring . ''",
