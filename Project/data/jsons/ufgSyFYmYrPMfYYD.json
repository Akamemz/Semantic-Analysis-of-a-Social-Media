    "content": "In a stunning blow , Prime Minister David Cameron narrowly lost a parliamentary vote Thursday night in favor of striking Syria militarily . It was a rare defeat in Britain , where prime ministers are used to winning parliamentary support for their major foreign policy initiatives .\nBut it was also an unexpected blow to the US , which has for decades counted on Britain to serve by its military side , from Afghanistan and Iraq to , more recently , Libya .\nMr. Cameron accepted the defeat , by 285 to 272 votes , of a measure that would have paved the way to British military intervention in Syria after claims that the government used chemical weapons to gas citizens near Damascus last week .\n`` I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons , but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons , \u00a8 Cameron said last night . `` It is very clear tonight that while the House has not passed a motion , it is clear to me that the British parliament , reflecting the views of the British people , does not want to see British military action \u2013 I get that and the government will act accordingly . ''\nBritish lawmakers revealed deep skepticism about the current evidence over who exactly used chemical weapons that killed upwards of 350 people in last week 's attack in Syria , reflecting the fallout from intelligence failures in Iraq a decade ago . At that time , claims of weapons of mass destruction instigated the war , but ultimately were found to be false . The European debate on Syria a decade later shows how the Iraq intervention continues to guide thinking on military affairs and impact US-European military cooperation , especially with Britain and France .\nBut for all the similarities with Iraq , there are significant differences as well , including the US ambivalence about getting involved , the scale of the attack , and the evidence at hand . The impact of US-British relations , therefore , even if the two powers diverge on Syria , might be limited in the long term .\n`` Usually the Americans almost automatically count on the British to be on their side for their actions , and the fact that it is not going to be the case this time ... will probably strain a little bit the relationship , '' says Vivien Pertusot , head of the Brussels office for the French Institute of International Relations .\nBut , he adds , the US is also not convinced of the merits of a military strike , and the stakes are smaller . `` In the long run it will not impact that much the relationship because we are not talking about a large scale war , that the American government is betting its entire administration on , '' he says . `` We are talking about a limited airstrike , for a limited time . ''\nIt is clear that the experience of Iraq in 2003 , which was launched with faulty evidence and turned into a years-long quagmire , loomed over the parliamentary debate in Britain . `` The Iraq war is still in everyone 's minds , '' says Mr. Pertusot . `` The fact that today we are not entirely sure who did what , or who used what , \u2026 a lot of people can associate very easily that this resembles what we were facing in 2003 . They voted in favor at the time , they learned afterwards that it was a mistake , and they don\u00b4t want to make the same mistake again . ''\nBut Iraq acts far less as a cautionary tale in the foreign policy debate in France , which was the loudest critic to intervention to Iraq in 2003 .\n`` I think that the ghosts of Iraq are still hovering over Britain more than France because Britain was heavily implicated , '' says Karim Bitar , a senior research fellow at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris . `` France opposed the Iraq war in 2003 which sort of frees it psychologically .
