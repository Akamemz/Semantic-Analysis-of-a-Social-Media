    "content": "Still , advocates are confident it can be done and , for the sake of the planet , needs to be done , both here and across the country . As one state lawmaker puts it : \u201c If we \u2019 re the only state that moves to 100 % renewable energy , even if we did it tomorrow , it would mean nothing if everyone else didn \u2019 t come with us .\nBut even in this environmentally-conscious state , the path to 100 % renewable energy is strewn with obstacles . Many will sound familiar to residents of other states . But some are unique to Hawaii . For one thing , this bejeweled archipelago has no means of transmitting electricity between its eight main islands , so each island will have to find its own path to energy independence . Another hurdle takes the form of an endangered bat the size of a salt shaker that is sacred to Native Hawaiians and drawn to wind turbines .\nHawaii has its own reasons for wanting to ditch fossil fuels . With no energy deposits of its own , state residents bear the highest energy costs in the country . More broadly , the idea of shifting to a green energy economy fits well with the prevailing ethos of the islands : malama \u2018 aina , a Native Hawaiian term for environmental stewardship .\nDavid Bissell \u2019 s Toyota Tundra crunches to a stop in the reddish dirt and gravel road as the first heads appear in the grass . A few sheep come into view , but , startled by the trucks , they skitter away through the unruly vegetation surrounding a network of solar panels . After a few moments , they calm and return to work , munching away on the island \u2019 s ever-present guinea grass .\nThese are the ovine foot soldiers in one of the most ambitious renewable energy revolutions in the United States . The Lawa \u2018 i solar and energy storage project on the island of Kauai employs 300 sheep to keep the invasive guinea grass from engulfing the solar panels that supply 11 % of the island \u2019 s electricity . This project is on the leading edge of a statewide effort to achieve 100 % renewable energy by the year 2045 .\nIn 2015 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to mandate a total transition to renewable energy . With exceptionally high energy prices and an ingrained environmental ethos , Hawaii has positioned itself as a pioneer in the quest to move toward a future free of fossil fuels . But promises are easy to make . Achieving them is another story .\nLawmakers , energy providers , and communities around the country are watching to see if the 50th state will be able to make good on the pledge to become America \u2019 s first green energy economy .\n\u201c We passed our [ renewable portfolio standards ] at a time when people said it was politically , technologically , and financially impossible , \u201d says Hawaii Democratic state Rep. Chris Lee , an early booster of the state \u2019 s clean energy initiative . \u201c No one had ever done the due diligence to figure out how this could be achieved . \u201d\nAs the world confronts the possibility of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the next 15 to 30 years , the race is on here and around the globe to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources . Solar and wind power have become competitive with other energy sources only in the past few years , and the technology is rapidly becoming more reliable and cost-effective as battery storage improves .\nCalifornia , New Mexico , Washington , New York , Nevada , and Maine have already followed Hawaii \u2019 s lead and adopted legislation calling for 100 % reliance on clean energy by various dates in the future . A handful of other states have set less ambitious goals of between 30 % and 50 % dependence on renewables . Mr. Lee is working with legislators in half a dozen more states , including Minnesota , Massachusetts , and Colorado , that are exploring clean energy mandates of their own .\nYet the challenges facing all these states \u2013 as well as Hawaii \u2013 are numerous . All , for instance , will have to go through a substantial culture shift , encouraging changes in consumer habits and weaning utilities off conventional forms of energy that have been around for more than a century . All will have to overcome practical problems such as revamping electrical grids to keep pace with the proliferation of rooftop solar .\nYet Hawaii also faces challenges unique to itself . These include some as fundamental as the difficulty of transmitting electricity among the eight major islands that make up this bejeweled archipelago , and others as unpredictable as dealing with the presence of an endangered bat the size of a salt shaker that is drawn to wind turbines .\nNathan Eagle/Honolulu Civil Beat The Kahuku Wind Farm on Oahu \u2019 s North Shore has been operating since 2011 . Plans are underway for a second wind farm at the site , though some residents oppose it .\nWill Hawaii emerge as America \u2019 s king of green energy or just be a well-intentioned pretender to the throne ?\nUnder the 2015 law , Hawaii must meet interim renewable portfolio standards of 30 % by 2020 , 40 % by 2030 , and 70 % by 2040 . Hitting these benchmarks , particularly the early ones , is considered crucial to the success of the program .\n\u201c The key thing is to get started with steady , relatively quick growth , \u201d says Rob Sargent , senior director of the Campaign for 100 % Renewable Energy at the Denver-based nonprofit Environment America . Mr. Sargent says states that build momentum early \u2013 either through rate policies or legislative mandates , or as a result of simple market economics \u2013 end up achieving the most success later .\nAnd Hawaii is doing well so far . By the end of 2017 , the state was generating 28 % of its utility sales from renewable sources , according to the Public Utilities Commission \u2019 s most recent annual report to the Legislature . Getting to the next goal , 40 % , shouldn \u2019 t be too difficult , either .\n\u201c We \u2019 re pretty much going to blow that one out of the water , \u201d says Scott Seu , a spokesman for Hawaiian Electric Co. , the state \u2019 s largest utility , which serves Oahu .\nFor now , solar and wind power dominate the state \u2019 s renewable mix , having outpaced production from biomass , geothermal , and hydroelectric facilities . Yet the majority of the state \u2019 s electricity is still produced by petroleum- and coal-fired power plants .\nWith no fossil fuel reserves of its own , Hawaii has the highest energy costs in the country . There has always been an abundance of renewable sources to tap \u2013 sun , wind , waves , volcanoes \u2013 but it has taken a shift in political will and a drop in photovoltaic and turbine prices for the state to turn away from oil , gas , and coal .\n\u201c We \u2019 re trying to push ourselves to expand our thinking so we don \u2019 t approach the problem the same old way , \u201d says Mr. Seu .\nAn assortment of fringe renewable energy projects is in various stages of development throughout the islands that could ultimately contribute to Hawaii \u2019 s green portfolio . This includes several efforts to harness one of Hawaii \u2019 s most abundant resources : the ocean .\nResearchers at the U.S. Marine Corps and the University of Hawai \u2018 i at Ma\u2013noa as well as private companies are exploring the potential of wave energy . The company Honolulu Seawater Air Conditioning wants to use water pumped from the deep sea to cool buildings in downtown Honolulu , effectively eliminating 1 % of the energy demand for the island of Oahu . Another Oahu-based company , Makai , is cultivating a process that uses the temperature differential between cold deep-sea waters and warm surface waters to generate energy .\nSOURCE : Honolulu Seawater Air Conditioning | Carlie Procell/Honolulu Civil Beat\n\u201c Hawaii is a great incubator because it \u2019 s small , \u201d says Mr. Bissell , president and chief executive officer of the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative .\nIn 2017 , KIUC teamed up with Tesla , the electric carmaker , on a project to store power produced by solar energy in a large-scale battery system . The cooperative model made it easier to take a risk on a long-term project , Mr. Bissell says .\nThe co-op continues to lead the way in \u201c solar-plus-storage \u201d with the sprawling Lawa \u2018 i solar farm here tended by the grass-shearing sheep . The nearly 200-acre network of glistening solar panels incorporates the world \u2019 s largest operational solar-plus-storage facility . It has the capacity to hold 100 megawatt-hours of electricity . Battery storage is crucial for any intermittent sources of power , like solar and wind energy , so utilities can provide power when the sun isn \u2019 t shining or the wind isn \u2019 t blowing .\n\u201c These projects do more than bring in energy at night , \u201d says Mr. Bissell . \u201c They improve reliability because they can make up for outages in other parts of the system . \u201d\nSolar power is by far the fastest-growing source of renewable energy in the state .\nJ. David Ake/AP/File The dense skyline of the Waikiki area of Honolulu is seen from the top of Diamond Head before daybreak . One company is researching using deep-sea water to cool buildings in the city .\nWhile wind generation has gained a firm foothold in Texas , California , and several Plains states , it has found less traction in Hawaii . One reason : birds .\nKauai , for instance , has long been a haven for two endangered species of seabirds , the Newell \u2019 s shearwater and the Hawaiian petrel . While both are present on other islands , they are more prevalent on Kauai where there are no natural predators . Conservationists and others worry about the turbine blades \u2019 effect on seabird populations .\nOahu , on the other hand , has invested heavily in wind power , despite concerns from community members about the noise and what they perceive as the unsightliness of the massive blades . Another concern could prove to be problematic on the island , though : the deaths of the Hawaiian hoary bat , the state \u2019 s only native land mammal .\nThe drive up Oahu \u2019 s iconic windward coastline starts on the ancient cliffs of Makapu \u2018 u , luring tourists \u2013 or visitors , as Hawaii residents call them \u2013 to the sapphire and turquoise waters of Hanauma Bay . Long past the marine parks , the hushed Valley of the Temples , and the zip lines and ATV tours of Kualoa Ranch , the Kamehameha Highway gives way to coastal farms of macadamia nuts , taro , and passion fruit .\nOahu \u2019 s North Shore was the last corner of the island to be settled by Native Hawaiians , but the first to be discovered by white settlers . In the 19th century , the rich agricultural lands tended by native residents were converted into sugar and pineapple plantations , transforming the region \u2019 s landscape , economy , and demography , as Chinese , Japanese , and Filipino workers arrived to work the land .\nPlantations held their grip on the North Shore for most of the 20th century . But in recent years , residents have slowly begun to reclaim the land . The island \u2019 s last remaining sugar plantation closed in 1996 . Community organizations founded with the promise of \u201c keeping the country , country \u201d have blocked most large development projects here , and small farms have once again begun to flourish .\nIn 2016 , Turtle Bay Resort relinquished nearly 500 acres of farmland to the Trust for Public Land and North Shore Community Land Trust , a victory for the sustainable agriculture movement that hopes to wean the state off dependence on imported produce .\nCory Lum/Honolulu Civil Beat \u201c Windmills are modern-day smokestacks . If you think about it , 150 years ago people thought smokestacks were awesome because they symbolized progress. \u201d \u2013 Gil Riviere , a state senator who opposes the creation of a new wind farm on Oahu \u2019 s North Shore\nState Sen. Gil Riviere , a Democrat , worries that the state \u2019 s push for renewable energy could jeopardize that promise . As co-director of Keep the North Shore Country , he is on the front lines of the effort to block development of the Na Pua Makani Wind Project .\n\u201c Windmills are modern-day smokestacks , \u201d says Mr. Riviere . \u201c If you think about it , 150 years ago people thought smokestacks were awesome because they symbolized progress . \u201d\nIn his role as a state senator , he hears a lot of complaints about windmills from his North Shore constituents . \u201c We are very supportive of renewable energy , \u201d says one of them , Te\u2013vita Ka \u2018 ili , speaking for his family . \u201c However we have one major concern about industrial wind turbines . It has to do with the killing of the \u2018 o\u2013pe \u2018 ape \u2018 a , or the hoary bat . \u201d\nWeighing just half an ounce , Hawaiian hoary bats are notoriously difficult to count , since they are solitary and easily disappear into treetop roosts . No one knows how many hoary bats call these islands home , but anecdotally , residents say they used to encounter more of them than they do now , according to Kristin Jonasson , a bat expert who spent a year and a half studying the tiny mammals .\nFrank Bonaccorso/USGS \u201c It \u2019 s just sort of contradictory to me that we \u2019 re saving the environment by destroying the [ hoary ] bats. \u201d \u2013 T\u0113vita Ka \u2018 ili , cultural anthropologist at Brigham Young University-Hawaii , referring to the state \u2019 s only native land mammal\nWind developers expected that turbines would kill some endangered bats , but data from the state Department of Land and Natural Resources has found that the mortality rate has far surpassed initial projections . An estimated 146 hoary bats were killed at the state \u2019 s five largest wind farms in just six years , 2.6 times the projected rate of 187 deaths over 20 years .\nFor many , the losses carry a heavy cultural burden . The hoary bat is sacred to many Polynesian cultures . It is considered one of the many manifestations of the Native Hawaiian Lono deity , and some Native Hawaiian families consider bats to be their ancestral guardians , or \u2018 aumakua .\nWhile Mr. Ka \u2018 ili , a cultural anthropologist and chair of the Department of International Cultural Studies at Brigham Young University-Hawaii , lauds the motivation behind the push for wind power , he worries that it comes at too steep a cost . \u201c It \u2019 s just sort of contradictory to me that we \u2019 re saving the environment by destroying the bats , \u201d he says .\nThe push to tap the sun presents both problems and promise for Hawaii , too . The state leads the nation in rooftop solar installation .\nSolar panels make long-term economic sense for homeowners in this sun-kissed paradise . A limited number of no-interest loans are available to offset installation costs , and residents can take advantage of state and federal tax credits ( though federal incentives are set to phase out after 2019 ) .\nWhile rooftop panels can yield major savings for homeowners , renters and people living in multifamily homes or condominiums typically can \u2019 t take advantage of those benefits . That disparity can deepen an already steep economic divide in a state where a billionaire can own an entire island while half of all residents live paycheck to paycheck .\nThe surge in solar panels has put a strain on utilities as well . The mismatch of timing between peak daytime generation and peak evening demand means that power generated from home solar installations can quickly flood the grid during the day . On Molokai , one of the smallest of Hawaii \u2019 s main islands , excess residential solar power flowing to the grid has actually become a safety concern , says Gregg Kresge , manager of renewable energy projects for Maui Electric Co. , which serves the islands of Maui , Lanai , and Molokai . The issue has become enough of a problem that the company has a pilot program to provide batteries for residential use to avoid overloading the grid .\nNathan Eagle/Honolulu Civil Beat The Lawa \u2018 i solar and energy storage project on the island of Kauai employs 300 sheep to keep invasive guinea grass from engulfing the solar panels that supply 11 % of the island \u2019 s electricity .\nMolokai was at one point projected to hit 100 % renewable as soon as 2020 . But after receiving stiff criticism for failing to solicit adequate community input before approving a solar power plant last year , Maui Electric has slowed its plans .\nSimilar sentiments emerged at a recent community meeting in Maui , which the company co-hosted with the Maui chapter of the Sierra Club of Hawai \u2018 i and Maui Tomorrow Foundation . Residents and advocates expressed support for the 100 % renewable initiative , but also concern that the goal should not be met at any cost . Many in attendance were reluctant to support wind farms out of concern for the islands \u2019 endangered birds . Others urged the utility and the planning commission to put solar panels on rooftops and in abandoned lots before erecting massive solar farms on pristine undeveloped land .\nM\u0101ui is a mythical figure in Native Hawaiian lore who has unusual powers . He can lasso the sun \u2019 s rays to slow its passage across the sky and lengthen the day .\nAt the recent community meeting in Maui , organizers opened with comments from Kapono \u2018 ai Molitau , a Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner , or kumu , who recounted the tale of Ma\u2013ui . It was intended to show both the importance of the sun and the importance of being sensitive to native culture as Hawaii tries to forge a green future .\nHawaii is the only U.S. state that has never had a white majority . While Hawaiian residents hail from around the world , many have adopted the native ethos of malama \u2018 aina , the idea of caring for the land in a way that won \u2019 t harm it for future generations .\nIn the past , Hawaii \u2019 s utilities have faced sharp rebukes for failing to take into account the cultural needs of Native Hawaiians when developing other forms of renewable energy . On Kauai , hydroelectric projects that date back to the island \u2019 s plantation era drained streams dry when the water was diverted to support big agriculture . The siphoning led to the decline in traditional taro farming by Native Hawaiians , a practice that is only now seeing a revival . Some groups here oppose a plan by KIUC to maintain these hydroelectric projects for this reason .\n\u201c This is a perfect example of when we should chart a new path and not just do business as usual , \u201d says Isaac Moriwake , Honolulu-based attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice . \u201c We can meet the goals without having to trample on other people \u2019 s rights or prolong 100-year-old injustices . \u201d\nKIUC \u2019 s Mr. Bissell says the co-op is attempting to do just that by including Native Hawaiians in development plans for a new pumped-storage hydroelectric project on the west side of Kauai . Those plans are still in the early stages of development , but Hermina Morita , a former state legislator who is part Native Hawaiian , is encouraged by those efforts .\n\u201c I really see a lot of hope on Kauai , \u201d says Ms. Morita , a former chair of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

As co-director of Keep the North Shore Country, he is on the front lines of the effort to block development of the Na Pua Makani Wind Project.\n\n\u201cWindmills are modern-day smokestacks,\u201d says Mr. Riviere. \u201cIf you think about it, 150 years ago people thought smokestacks were awesome because they symbolized progress.\u201d\n\nIn his role as a state senator, he hears a lot of complaints about windmills from his North Shore constituents. \u201cWe are very supportive of renewable energy,\u201d says one of them, Te\u2013vita Ka\u2018ili, speaking for his family. \u201cHowever we have one major concern about industrial wind turbines. It has to do with the killing of the \u2018o\u2013pe\u2018ape\u2018a, or the hoary bat.\u201d\n\nWeighing just half an ounce, Hawaiian hoary bats are notoriously difficult to count, since they are solitary and easily disappear into treetop roosts. No one knows how many hoary bats call these islands home, but anecdotally, residents say they used to encounter more of them than they do now, according to Kristin Jonasson, a bat expert who spent a year and a half studying the tiny mammals.\n\nFrank Bonaccorso/USGS \u201cIt\u2019s just sort of contradictory to me that we\u2019re saving the environment by destroying the [hoary] bats.\u201d \u2013 T\u0113vita Ka\u2018ili, cultural anthropologist at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, referring to the state\u2019s only native land mammal\n\nWind developers expected that turbines would kill some endangered bats, but data from the state Department of Land and Natural Resources has found that the mortality rate has far surpassed initial projections. An estimated 146 hoary bats were killed at the state\u2019s five largest wind farms in just six years, 2.6 times the projected rate of 187 deaths over 20 years.\n\nFor many, the losses carry a heavy cultural burden. The hoary bat is sacred to many Polynesian cultures. It is considered one of the many manifestations of the Native Hawaiian Lono deity, and some Native Hawaiian families consider bats to be their ancestral guardians, or \u2018aumakua.\n\nWhile Mr. Ka\u2018ili, a cultural anthropologist and chair of the Department of International Cultural Studies at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, lauds the motivation behind the push for wind power, he worries that it comes at too steep a cost. \u201cIt\u2019s just sort of contradictory to me that we\u2019re saving the environment by destroying the bats,\u201d he says.\n\nClouds over solar\n\nThe push to tap the sun presents both problems and promise for Hawaii, too. The state leads the nation in rooftop solar installation.\n\nSolar panels make long-term economic sense for homeowners in this sun-kissed paradise. A limited number of no-interest loans are available to offset installation costs, and residents can take advantage of state and federal tax credits (though federal incentives are set to phase out after 2019).\n\nWhile rooftop panels can yield major savings for homeowners, renters and people living in multifamily homes or condominiums typically can\u2019t take advantage of those benefits. That disparity can deepen an already steep economic divide in a state where a billionaire can own an entire island while half of all residents live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThe surge in solar panels has put a strain on utilities as well. The mismatch of timing between peak daytime generation and peak evening demand means that power generated from home solar installations can quickly flood the grid during the day. On Molokai, one of the smallest of Hawaii\u2019s main islands, excess residential solar power flowing to the grid has actually become a safety concern, says Gregg Kresge, manager of renewable energy projects for Maui Electric Co., which serves the islands of Maui, Lanai, and Molokai. The issue has become enough of a problem that the company has a pilot program to provide batteries for residential use to avoid overloading the grid.\n\nNathan Eagle/Honolulu Civil Beat The Lawa\u2018i solar and energy storage project on the island of Kauai employs 300 sheep to keep invasive guinea grass from engulfing the solar panels that supply 11% of the island\u2019s electricity.\n\nMolokai was at one point projected to hit 100% renewable as soon as 2020. But after receiving stiff criticism for failing to solicit adequate community input before approving a solar power plant last year, Maui Electric has slowed its plans.\n\nMalama \u2018aina\n\nSimilar sentiments emerged at a recent community meeting in Maui, which the company co-hosted with the Maui chapter of the Sierra Club of Hawai\u2018i and Maui Tomorrow Foundation. Residents and advocates expressed support for the 100% renewable initiative, but also concern that the goal should not be met at any cost. Many in attendance were reluctant to support wind farms out of concern for the islands\u2019 endangered birds. Others urged the utility and the planning commission to put solar panels on rooftops and in abandoned lots before erecting massive solar farms on pristine undeveloped land.\n\nM\u0101ui is a mythical figure in Native Hawaiian lore who has unusual powers. He can lasso the sun\u2019s rays to slow its passage across the sky and lengthen the day.\n\nAt the recent community meeting in Maui, organizers opened with comments from Kapono\u2018ai Molitau, a Native Hawaiian cultural practitioner, or kumu, who recounted the tale of Ma\u2013ui. It was intended to show both the importance of the sun and the importance of being sensitive to native culture as Hawaii tries to forge a green future.\n\nHawaii is the only U.S. state that has never had a white majority. While Hawaiian residents hail from around the world, many have adopted the native ethos of malama \u2018aina, the idea of caring for the land in a way that won\u2019t harm it for future generations.\n\nIn the past, Hawaii\u2019s utilities have faced sharp rebukes for failing to take into account the cultural needs of Native Hawaiians when developing other forms of renewable energy. On Kauai, hydroelectric projects that date back to the island\u2019s plantation era drained streams dry when the water was diverted to support big agriculture. The siphoning led to the decline in traditional taro farming by Native Hawaiians, a practice that is only now seeing a revival. Some groups here oppose a plan by KIUC to maintain these hydroelectric projects for this reason.\n\n\u201cThis is a perfect example of when we should chart a new path and not just do business as usual,\u201d says Isaac Moriwake, Honolulu-based attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice. \u201cWe can meet the goals without having to trample on other people\u2019s rights or prolong 100-year-old injustices.\u201d\n\nKIUC\u2019s Mr. Bissell says the co-op is attempting to do just that by including Native Hawaiians in development plans for a new pumped-storage hydroelectric project on the west side of Kauai. Those plans are still in the early stages of development, but Hermina Morita, a former state legislator who is part Native Hawaiian, is encouraged by those efforts.\n\n\u201cI really see a lot of hope on Kauai,\u201d says Ms. Morita, a former chair of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

But advocates are confident it can be done and, for the sake of the planet, needs to be done, both here and across the country. \u201cIf we\u2019re the only state that moves to 100% renewable energy, even if we did it tomorrow, it would mean nothing if everyone else didn\u2019t come with us,\u201d says Mr. Lee, the state lawmaker.\n\nThis story was a collaboration between The Christian Science Monitor and Honolulu Civil Beat.
