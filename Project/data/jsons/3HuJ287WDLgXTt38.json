''\nEarlier Tuesday , the World Health Organization said the US could become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic , citing a `` very large acceleration '' in infections .\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday signaled that he wanted to ease up on coronavirus-related restrictions in a matter of weeks , even as his top experts say it could take months for life to go back to normal .\n`` I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter , '' Trump said during a Fox News town-hall event at the White House . Easter is on April 12 , in 19 days .\nThe Fox News host Bill Hemmer responded that it `` would be a great American resurrection . ''\nIn a second interview with Fox News later on Tuesday , when Trump was asked by Hemmer how he came up with Easter as the date for easing coronavirus restrictions , the president said , `` Easter is a very special day for me . ''\n`` Would n't it be great to have all the churches full ? '' Trump added . `` You 'll have packed churches all over our country . I think it 'll be a beautiful time . ''\nAt the moment , churches across the US have moved services online due to coronavirus and calls for social distancing .\nTrump 's call to reopen the US economy goes against what his own experts have said , as well as warnings from governors on the front lines of the pandemic .\n`` I can not see that all of a sudden , next week or two weeks from now , it 's going to be over . I do n't think there 's a chance of that , '' Dr. Anthony Fauci , the US 's top expert on infectious diseases , said on Friday .\n`` I think we should do everything we possibly can do , '' Fauci added . `` I mean , in all sectors , because obviously , as I 've said so many times , when you think you 're maybe overreacting , you probably are not acting as forcefully as you should . So as we 've always said , we 've got to try very much to stay ahead of the curve . ''\nShortly before the Fox News town hall , Gov . Andrew Cuomo of New York implored Trump not to risk endangering lives by rushing to reopen the economy .\nTrump on Monday said the US was not meant to be `` shut down , '' adding , `` We are going to be opening up our country for business because our country was meant to be open . ''\nCuomo said he was sympathetic to the economic consequences of keeping nonessential businesses closed but added : `` If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy , then it 's no contest . No American is going to say , 'Accelerate the economy at the cost of human life . ' Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth . ''\nEarlier Tuesday , the World Health Organization said the US could become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic , citing a `` very large acceleration '' in infections .

'' But the president has since signaled that he 's growing impatient with the stringent measures to fight the pandemic that have essentially shut down major US cities and dealt a huge blow to the economy .\nThe president on Tuesday suggested that more people could die by suicide because of stress and anxiety about the economy than would die from COVID-19 , the illness caused by the coronavirus .\n`` You 're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression , '' Trump said . `` You 're going to lose people .
