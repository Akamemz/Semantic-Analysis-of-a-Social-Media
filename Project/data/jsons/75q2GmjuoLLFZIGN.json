One of the issues standing in the way of that , Bloomberg said , was the inability of blue-collar workers to adapt to the information economy even if they have their education subsidized .\n`` The agrarian society lasted 3,000 years and we could teach processes . I could teach anybody , even people in this room , no offense intended , to be a farmer , '' Bloomberg said . `` It 's a process .
