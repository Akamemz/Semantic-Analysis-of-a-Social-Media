But that was always a somewhat shaky legal argument . As I noted in my Jan. 12 , 2017 , column , which first disclosed Flynn \u2019 s call , the Logan Act has never been criminally enforced .\nI wrote on Feb. 11 , two days before he resigned : \u201c Michael Flynn \u2019 s real problem isn \u2019 t the Logan Act , an obscure and probably unenforceable 1799 statute that bars private meddling in foreign policy disputes . It \u2019 s whether President Trump \u2019 s national security adviser sought to hide from his colleagues and the nation a pre-inauguration discussion with the Russian government about sanctions that the Obama administration was imposing . \u201d\nIn that column , I quoted a question posed to me by Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( D-Calif. ) , the House Intelligence Committee chairman who would later lead the impeachment investigation of Trump . \u201c Why would [ Flynn ] conceal the nature of the call unless he was conscious of wrongdoing ? \u201d\nThere was always a deeper problem , one that still isn \u2019 t resolved . Why was the Trump administration so eager to blunt the punishment Obama gave to Russia for what we now know was gross interference in our presidential election ? In his Dec. 29 expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats , Obama was trying to impose costs on an adversary . The evidence shows that Flynn wanted to reassure this same adversary and to avoid confrontation .\nHow do we know that was Flynn \u2019 s intention ? Because he said so in his Nov. 30 , 2017 , guilty plea admitting he had made false statements about his conversations with Kislyak . The \u201c statement of the offense \u201d that accompanied the agreement states that on Dec. 29 , 2016 , after discussions with another transition team official , Flynn \u201c called the Russian Ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. Sanctions in a reciprocal manner . \u201d\nWas Flynn improperly tricked in his Jan. 24 , 2017 , interview with the FBI into misstating what he had told Kislyak ? If so , why did he resign and later plead guilty ?\nIn Flynn \u2019 s Feb. 13 , 2017 , resignation letter , he admitted that he had made misleading statements to Vice President Pence about the Kislyak call . Here \u2019 s how he put it : \u201c Because of the fast pace of events , I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding phone calls with the Russian ambassador. \u201d That \u2019 s not the FBI talking , it \u2019 s Flynn .

We \u2019 ll review everything . \u2019 \u201d\nWhy does this matter ? Because the issue Flynn was discussing with Kislyak was so serious . Russia had secretly subverted our democratic elections . Obama , who had delayed sanctions far too long , finally took action with the Dec. 29 expulsions . He did so on behalf of the nation , whose election system had been attacked .\nThe intelligence community had first disclosed Russia \u2019 s meddling on Oct. 7 , 2016 , in a statement that charged that \u201c Russia \u2019 s senior-most officials \u201d had conducted a cyberattack \u201c intended to interfere with the US election process . \u201d\nThat initial damning assessment was amplified in a Jan. 6 , 2017 , report , in which the intelligence community said Russia had tried to \u201c denigrate \u201d the Democratic candidate , Hillary Clinton , and \u201c harm her electability and potential presidency \u201d and that Moscow had a \u201c clear preference \u201d for Trump .\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee , led by a Republican , spent the past three years investigating whether our spy chiefs \u2019 finding was correct .
