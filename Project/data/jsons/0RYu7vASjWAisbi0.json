    "content": "Now that Donald Trump delivers scripted remarks , one of his more amusing mannerisms is reacting to some of the lines as if he \u2019 s a listener himself , rather than the person who , in theory , came up with them . For instance , on Wednesday night , when Trump said about recent immigrants that \u201c many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country , \u201d he added . \u201c So true. \u201d That \u2019 s a perfectly natural reaction if you don \u2019 t read your own speechwriter \u2019 s draft first\u2014or , more likely , you just skim it . Some of the lines will likely be of as much interest to you as to anyone in the audience .\nNevertheless , Trump had a good day on Wednesday , and , whether you like it or not , he \u2019 s also had a good week . Only seven days ago , Hillary Clinton delivered a scorching speech linking Trump to white nationalism and some of the nuttiest voices in American public life , and even many people on the right seemed to agree that it hit home . But Clinton \u2019 s remarks seem to have done less lingering damage than people thought , and they already appear to be fading from the conversation . Meanwhile , Trump has suffered no major scandals and injured himself in no serious way . He took a trip to Mexico and met with its president , at best showing himself to be capable of polite behavior as a guest in a foreign country , and at worst making no difference at all . And Trump \u2019 s numbers have only gone up this week . Some polls even show him ahead of Clinton .\nIf there \u2019 s any other clue that Trump poses a threat once more , it \u2019 s that the temperature has risen , once again , at The New York Times . On Wednesday night , its editorial board denounced Trump for \u201c relentless lies , \u201d \u201c police-state bluster , \u201d and \u201c vicious talk. \u201d It added that Arizona \u2019 s harsh immigration policies made the state a \u201c perversely appropriate \u201d setting for the speech , returning five lines later with the thought that Arizona \u2019 s harsh immigration policies made the state a \u201c fitting backdrop \u201d for the speech . Not to be outdone , columnist Charles M. Blow called Trump a \u201c frightening type of man , whose basic character is vile but not inviolable , who springs from darkness and bends toward anything that casts light , \u201d whatever that means . And Nicholas Kristof offered up a column mentioning Hitler , ISIS , Russia , the American Nazi Party , North Korea , and the Ku Klux Klan . One pictures everyone in the office coming in this morning , hung over , rubbing their temples , reading what they wrote , and quietly asking if anyone remembers what happened .\nSo how did Trump \u2019 s speech , delivered at a Phoenix rally , really go ? No one can yet say . Ultimately , the only relevant measurement is whether it moved his numbers up or down relative to those of his opponent , and we lack such numbers . But we can say this much : it reassured Trump \u2019 s followers\u2014and we \u2019 ve seen this pattern with Trump before\u2014that , despite recent rhetoric about softening , Trump remains a hard-liner on enforcement .\nIt also laid out more specifics than ever before . Contrary to the assertion from the Times that Trump offered \u201c not so much a policy as empty words strung together and repeated , \u201d the speech was concrete about many measures : entry/exit biometric data systems , a wall , and so on . ( The Times also quoted Trump as calling for a \u201c deportation force , \u201d when in fact he called for a \u201c deportation task force \u201d \u2014which is like conflating a police force with a police task force . )\nThere \u2019 s one other thing we can say : immigration speeches don \u2019 t usually move people on the topic , because convictions run too strong .
