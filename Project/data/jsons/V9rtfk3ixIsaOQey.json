Russo case on March 4 , 2020 in Washington , DC .\nThe Supreme Court delivered surprising wins to liberals this week in a pair of blockbuster decisions that forbade businesses from firing workers base on their sexual orientation or gender identity and halted the Trump administration 's efforts to end the Obama-era DACA program , which shields the young migrants known as `` Dreamers .
