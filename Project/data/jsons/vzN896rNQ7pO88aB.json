The President is expected to release his full budget proposal in the coming weeks , but his administration has rolled out budget priorities that have many in Washington contemplating how agencies will get by with less .\nAlthough Trump made clear one place he wants to beef up spending is at the Pentagon .

And , since the cuts would be applied to an operating budget of about $ 9 billion , GOP budget hawks on the Hill have been quick to slam them as too deep a reduction to the military branch 's funding .\nThe Trump administration , led by Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney , has made clear that the State Department will experience wholesale budget cuts in their first budget , with a target squarely on foreign aid sent abroad by the United States .\nMultiple Trump administration officials have also made clear that the foreign aid -- which makes up roughly 1 % of the federal budget -- will be cut significantly under the new plan .\nWhile cutting foreign aid has long been a target for conservatives , those proposed cuts have drawn out critics from both sides of the aisle .
