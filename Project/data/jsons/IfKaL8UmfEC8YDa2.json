In that 2010 case , a narrow conservative court majority upset a century-long legal understanding and declared for the first time that corporations are people entitled to spend unlimited amounts on candidate elections . Those independent expenditure limitations were one pillar of the campaign finance law .\nOn Tuesday , the second pillar \u2014 contributions to candidates \u2014 is before the court . The justices will hear arguments on one aspect of contributions : the aggregate limits on contributions to candidates and political parties .\nThe case was brought by Shaun McCutcheon , a successful Alabama businessman whose real love is conservative politics . In the 2012 election season , McCutcheon gave roughly $ 33,000 to 16 Republican congressional candidates and a similar amount to Republican Party committees . He wanted to give more , but a federal law caps the aggregate amounts that individuals can give to candidates and political parties . In 2012 , those caps were roughly $ 46,000 for candidates and $ 70,000 for party committees .\nOf course , McCutcheon could spend any amount he wants to by giving to independent groups that have proliferated since Citizens United . These groups raise millions of dollars to spend on candidate elections , but they do so independently and are not supposed to coordinate with the candidate campaigns . McCutcheon , however , does n't want to give to independent groups ; he wants to give directly to candidates and the Republican Party .\nAs he said in an interview with NPR , `` It 's just that sometimes it 's more advantageous for the donor to donate directly to the campaign . ''\nThat advantage is at the heart of the issue before the Supreme Court on Tuesday . In 1974 , in the wake of the Watergate scandal , Congress enacted the laws that still form the basic structure for campaign finance regulations . Part of that structure is the aggregate cap , which is intended to prevent circumventing limits on the amount that single donors can pour into campaigns .\nThe Supreme Court upheld an earlier version of the caps in 1976 , and since then it has drawn a consistent line between expenditure limits on the one hand and contribution limits on the other . The distinction is based on the notion that large contributions to candidates pose the threat of `` the actuality '' and the `` appearance '' of corruption .\nBut McCutcheon says all he wants to do is give to more candidates and party groups . `` What the aggregate limits do is not limit how much you can give to a particular candidate , but limit how many candidates you can support in an effective way , '' says James Bopp , McCutcheon 's lawyer .\nNot so , say defenders of the aggregate limits . Without the aggregate caps , a single wealthy donor could give the current $ 5,200 maximum in a two-year cycle to all 468 of a party 's House and Senate candidates , for a grand total of nearly $ 2.5 million . The same individual could also give about $ 1.2 million more per election cycle to the national and state party committees . And that does n't even account for the $ 5,000 contributions to other political action committees .\nAttorney Fred Wertheimer has helped write every campaign finance reform law since 1974 . He observes that in the modern political world , members of Congress can and do set up joint fundraising committees that in turn funnel money to candidates .\nWithout the aggregate limits , `` the speaker of the House or the Democratic leader of the House could go to Mr. McCutcheon and ask him for a check for well over $ 2 million , '' says Wertheimer , `` and it is that relationship \u2014 that $ 2 million solicited by a powerful officeholder and given by a donor \u2014 that creates the corruption relationship that the court says Congress can prohibit . ''\nThat 's `` just a scare tactic , '' replies Bopp . `` They ca n't point to a single instance where this has ever happened . That tells you that this is just rank speculation . ''\nSpeculation or not , the fact is that soliciting or giving such aggregate amounts has been illegal for almost 40 years .
