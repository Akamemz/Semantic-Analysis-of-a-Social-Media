One declared the Tea Party movement \u201c significantly weakened \u201d in the wake of November \u2019 s elections and on its way to becoming \u201c just another political faction. \u201d The other noted that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell might be concerned about a potential 2014 primary challenge \u2013 enough to filibuster any fiscal cliff plan that President Obama and Democrats draw up , no matter how modest .\nThe problem , of course , is that the Tea Party \u2019 s power resides in Republican primaries , where conservative purists wreaked considerable havoc in the past two election cycles . This included , famously , McConnell \u2019 s home state of Kentucky , where the minority leader \u2019 s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was crushed in a 2010 GOP Senate primary by Rand Paul . Now McConnell has to worry about suffering a similar fate in two years , especially if his handling of the current fiscal impasse evokes cries of treason from the base . How could this square with claims of fading clout for the Tea Party ?\nActually , there \u2019 s a way . It just depends on how you understand the Tea Party .\nDefined as a literal movement , with an active membership pressing a specific set of demands , the Tea Party absolutely is in decline .

As I wrote back in \u2019 10 , the Tea Party essentially gave a name to a phenomenon we \u2019 ve seen before in American politics \u2013 fierce , over-the-top resentment of and resistance to Democratic presidents by the right . It happened when Bill Clinton was president , it happened when Lyndon Johnson was president , it happened when John F. Kennedy was president . When a Democrat claims the White House , conservatives invariably convince themselves that he is a dangerous radical intent on destroying the country they know and love and mobilize to thwart him .\nThe twist in the Obama-era is that some of the conservative backlash has been directed inward .
