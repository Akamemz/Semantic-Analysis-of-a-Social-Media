''\nThe billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement `` of competence and common sense and low taxes and [ secure ] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away . ''\nTrump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend , where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination .\nThe conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Mitch McConnell , House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen .\n`` I know all these people , '' Trump told Hannity . `` These are people that are taking advantage of our country . They don \u2019 t want to have strong borders . They want stuff flowing across the borders . They don \u2019 t want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that . ''\n`` Politicians will do what \u2019 s right for the people that gave them the money , '' Trump added later , `` not what 's right for the country . ''\nFormer GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump 's rivals on Thursday ahead of a GOP debate in Florida , fueling speculation that he 's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump .\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio , meanwhile , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he would not drop out of the Republican presidential race before next week 's Florida primary , saying , `` we 're gon na fight this thing through Tuesday ... and we 're going to go on . ''\nRubio denied multiple reports that he had discussed the possibility of dropping out before the winner-take-all contest .\nSpeaking with \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 Megyn Kelly , Rubio said : `` I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team , or anyone on the planet Earth ... I 'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida . \u201d\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida .\n`` I honestly don \u2019 t believe Donald Trump will be the nominee , '' Rubio said . `` I continue to believe it 's going to be me , and it 's got to start here in Florida . ''\nRubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called `` unity '' Republican ticket with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , Trump 's closest challenger in the delegate race , calling it `` the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about . ''\n`` At some point we 're all going to team up , '' Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates . `` We 're all going to be on the same team , I hope . \u201d\nCruz told Kelly that Rubio and Kasich were `` good , honorable people , but neither of them has a path to the nomination . ''\n`` Head-to-head , not only do I beat Donald Trump , '' Cruz said , `` but I defeat him resoundingly .

'' However , Cruz restated his opposition to a so-called brokered convention , calling it `` a fever dream of the D.C. establishment '' and warning of `` an open revolt '' among Republican voters if it came to pass .\nCruz later turned his rhetorical fire against Trump and Rubio over immigration reform and the so-called `` Gang of Eight '' bill in 2013 .\n`` When Marco Rubio stood with Barack Obama and [ Sen. ] Chuck Schumer and [ then-Senate Majority Leader ] Harry Reid ... I stood with millions of Americans , '' Cruz told Kelly . `` Not only was Donald Trump nowhere to be found , he was funding the Gang of Eight . He gave $ 50,000 to five of its members . ''\nCruz also accused Rubio of lowering the tone of the campaign , saying , `` I have no views whatsoever on any part of Donald Trump \u2019 s anatomy , '' an apparent reference to Rubio jabbing Trump 's `` small hands '' at a Virginia campaign stop .\nFor his part , Rubio told Megyn Kelly that he regretted the remark , saying `` my kids were embarrassed by it , my wife didn \u2019 t like it , I don \u2019 t think it reflects [ well ] ; that \u2019 s not who I am .
