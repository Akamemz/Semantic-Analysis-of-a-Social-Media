    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama and House Republicans began discussions Thursday on a GOP proposal to extend the nation 's borrowing authority for six weeks , marking a new opening in the budget stalemate that risks a U.S. debt crisis .\nAt a White House meeting of the president and top House Republicans , Speaker John Boehner ( R. , Ohio ) offered the proposal to extend U.S. borrowing authority in exchange for an agreement from Mr. Obama to negotiate on a broad range of budget issues .\nThe meeting ended inconclusively . But after weeks of stalemate and sniping , as well as a partial government shutdown that entered its 10th day Thursday , the inauguration of talks was a breakthrough that signaled a new openness on both sides .\nMr. Obama `` did n't say yes , he did n't say no '' to the GOP plan , said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) after the meeting with Mr. Obama . `` We put an offer on the table . We had a long , frank conversation about it , and we agreed to continue talking and to continue negotiating . ''\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said at a press conference Thursday that he and Republican colleagues want to `` offer the ability to move , '' including a temporary increase in the debt ceiling in return for talks with President Obama on the budget .\nJust the glimpse of a path to avoiding an unprecedented U.S. default sent stocks soaring . The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 323.09 points , or 2.2 % , to 15126.07 . Stocks also jumped higher in Asia Friday morning .\nA new poll shows that Republicans are bearing the brunt of public outrage over the budget impasse . The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 53 % of Americans blamed the GOP for the shutdown , compared with 31 % who blamed Mr. Obama . The Republican Party 's image has slumped to its lowest level in Journal/NBC polling , which dates to 1989 , with more than twice as many people holding a negative image of the GOP as a positive one .\nUntil now , Mr. Obama had refused to negotiate until the government was reopened and the debt ceiling raised . Republicans , in turn , said those steps must be paired with a deficit-reduction plan and changes to the 2010 health care law that they knew Mr. Obama would n't accept .\nWhile Republicans on Thursday initially proposed moving only to raise the debt limit , discussions broadened to include efforts to reopen the federal government .\nAfter the 90-minute meeting , the White House said in a statement that Mr. Obama `` looks forward to making continued progress '' in breaking the stalemate . `` After a discussion about potential paths forward , no specific determination was made '' about next steps , the White House said .\nThe GOP debt limit proposal had left unclear how the two sides would reach agreement on a bill to fully fund federal agencies and reopen the government . But House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers ( R. , Ky. ) said after the meeting that negotiators now were in talks to see if they could resolve both issues .\n`` We 're trying to find out if there is a way to quickly settle the [ government funding ] questions so that we can ... stop a shutdown , '' said Mr. Rogers .\nAccording to a Democrat briefed on the meeting , Mr. Obama asked Republican leaders why the government needed to remain closed when both sides want to have budget discussions . Republicans said they would offer specific ideas for opening the government , which sent staff working into the night to discuss components of a compromise government spending bill .\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R. , Va. ) told Mr. Obama during the meeting that Republicans were willing to work through the weekend on a funding package to reopen the government next week , as long as the president agreed to let lawmakers and aides start longer-term budget talks , according to a person familiar with his remarks .\nThe Treasury has said lawmakers must raise the debt ceiling this month or it will be unable to pay all the nation 's bills . A landmark comes Oct. 17 , the day the Treasury says it will have exhausted emergency measures and be left with $ 30 billion on hand , which would last a week or two .\nMr. Boehner , after a morning meeting with House Republicans to unveil his new strategy , said , `` I would hope that the president would look at this as an opportunity and a good-faith effort on our part to move halfway\u2014halfway\u2014to what he 's demanded in order to have these conversations begin . ''\nRepublicans had been prepared to vote as early as Friday on the bill to raise the debt limit . Now , GOP aides say , action has been postponed pending the outcome of the new talks .\nRepublican leaders have treated the debt ceiling issue as related but distinct from the terms for funding the government .

Conservative Republicans , meanwhile , did n't want the government to reopen until they had extracted concessions from Mr. Obama on the health law , which they have been pushing to delay or dismantle .\nRep. Raul Labrador ( R. , Idaho ) on Tuesday met with Mr. Cantor to make an offer : House conservatives could back a short-term extension of the country 's borrowing authority as long as GOP leaders agreed to use the shutdown fight as the vehicle to oppose the health law .\nThe support from conservatives such as Mr. Labrador proved crucial in producing the GOP 's breakthrough offer on the debt ceiling .\n`` We want to continue to fight on Obamacare , '' Mr. Labrador said Thursday . `` The best way for us to do that is to separate the two issues\u2026 .
