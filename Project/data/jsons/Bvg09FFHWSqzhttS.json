The place is calm , but I had the feeling cool stuff was happening .\nIt \u2019 s different and , I \u2019 ll admit , a bit unnerving for someone who likes structure .

Geographically and culturally.\n\nThe Facebook setting is so different from the work environments I\u2019m used to, including its open floor plans to encourage the constant flow of creativity and its casual nature. The place is calm, but I had the feeling cool stuff was happening.\n\nIt\u2019s different and, I\u2019ll admit, a bit unnerving for someone who likes structure. But it\u2019s also really neat. It\u2019s powerful. And they know it.\n\nFacebook invited 16 conservatives to a meeting it described as long overdue. Over time, the trust between conservatives and the company has been eroding.\n\nLast week\u2019s accusations from a former contract employee about the alleged practice of suppressing conservative viewpoints and news stories in its Trending Topics feature was the spark that lit a fire.\n\nThe meeting was an attempt to put the fire out and to begin to rebuild trust with the conservative community.\n\nThis was a meeting where two bubbles collided: one of conservative media and activists and the other of the world of Facebook.\n\nI went to the meeting with an open mind and a lot of curiosity. The Facebook executives we met with greeted us with humility and the admission that they need to do a better job.\n\nOverall, the meeting went well. Here are my five takeaways:\n\n1. Facebook recognized that it\u2019s lost trust with conservatives and it is genuinely serious about fixing it.\n\nWhile some in the conservative media worried that this meeting would be an insincere gesture and a mere photo-op (there were no cameras), the main company executives present -- including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- could not have been more genuine.\n\nIt was very clear that Facebook does not take these allegations lightly, and they acknowledged a real trust deficit with their conservative partners and users.\n\nI left feeling assured that Facebook would be working to repair relationships amidst the damaging allegations and to reestablish credibility in the conservative community about its commitment to inclusivity and neutrality.\n\n2. Civility and openness make for good communication.\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting was a civil environment where everyone had the opportunity to voice their opinions, concerns, and questions.\n\nImagine a meeting in 2016 where 16 different conservatives \u2013 representing all the different viewpoints we have \u2013 get along really well and are reminded of our common principles. (Maybe we should have the convention in Silicon Valley? OK, maybe in 2020).\n\nEveryone had a chance to speak and did so frankly. And respectfully.\n\nZuckerberg and his team did way more listening than talking, which left the door open for a meaningful conversation. And, despite the uncomfortable temperature in the room (the power went out in the headquarters just as the meeting started), Zuckerberg kept the meeting going for an additional 20 minutes so that everyone had a chance to speak and get their questions answered or ideas raised.\n\n3. Face-to-face is best for establishing trust.\n\nZuckerberg immediately acknowledged that this meeting was one he should have started long before.\n\nHe was right \u2013 and we can meet him halfway on that. But the fact that he invited all of us to Facebook\u2019s headquarters allowed everyone to voice their concerns and opinions to each other in one room, face-to-face. That showed an immediate level of respect from Zuckerberg and his team, and the same was true of the conservatives that were there.\n\nThe conservatives were prepared, specific, smart, and creative. This is an important thing to remember in business relationships, and even personal relationships.\n\nTo establish trust, always meet face-to-face.\n\n4. Employment diversity is not limited to gender and ethnicity.\n\nFacebook -- and Silicon Valley in general -- takes pride in their commitment to diversity among their employees. But a point that was made yesterday is that diversity in thought and opinion is critical as well for a well-rounded company.\n\nGender diversity and ethnic diversity are not the only ways to diversify, and Facebook clearly lacks conservative staffers. The company did not disagree.\n\n5. Conservatives need to keep using all the available social media platforms.\n\nSocial media as a whole has been a boon for conservatives. Never before could a conservative reach that many people without a mainstream media filter.\n\nConservatives have built followings, movements, and even presidential campaigns utilizing Facebook.\n\nSince the company has admitted it needs to do better, let\u2019s take them up on that.\n\nWe can offer specific solutions and bring creative ideas. We can pick up the phone or get on a plane and meet with people \u2013 I found them to be reasonable and approachable. This may not always be the case, but it is the situation we have right now.\n\nConservatives want Facebook to be more responsive, and we are pushing on an open door.
