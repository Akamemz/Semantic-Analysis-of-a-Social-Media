Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . You remember the theatrics . Senate Democrats and Republicans had a bipartisan package after working through the week and weekend . On March 21 , it was pretty much a done deal and then Pelosi , who had taken the week off , decided to announce that House Democrats would put forward their own relief bill , killing the Senate package . The markets tanked , which is what Democrats wanted to do . The House relief bill was trash , loaded with left-wing goodies and voting rights provisions that had nothing to do with helping American businesses and workers afflicted by the Wuhan virus outbreak . And after all of this , the package that was passed was not all that much different from the one that was unnecessarily nuked by sore-loser Democrats who still can not get over the 2016 election .\nPelosi is still trying to play politics during this crisis . Yet , while she does that , she 's also trying to give the core of the Democratic Party relief as well : millionaires . Yeah , only a moron believes that the Democratic Party is the party of the working man , the working poor , or the little guy .
