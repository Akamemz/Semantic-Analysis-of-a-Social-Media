And it \u2019 s clear that airstrikes alone won \u2019 t beat back the extremist group . Which means that if the President wants to have any hope of meeting his far-reaching goal of destroying ISIS , he \u2019 s going to have to rely on private military contractors .\nAt the height of the Iraq war , these firms hired hundreds of thousands of people : guns-for-hire , IT geeks , logistics specialists , interrogators , and short order cooks to ladle out the slop at the military cafeteria . Over time , some of those contractors became the symbol for everything that was wrong with the Iraq war : hugely expensive , ineffective , and indifferent to Iraqi life . Contractors were at the middle of the war \u2019 s biggest scandals , from Abu Ghraib to Nissour Square . And it was the abductions and murder of Blackwater contractors that sparked one of Iraq 's biggest battles .\nNone of the five current and former contractors who spoke with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 expected a replay of last decade \u2019 s Iraq war . But they all said a major opportunity was coming\u2014both for them , and for Obama , who could use the private armies as a way to conceal just how many people will be fighting in this new conflict .\n\u201c Iraq this time around is not going to be as big as it was before , \u201d said Roger Carstens , a former special operations officer who has served as a contracted military adviser in Somalia and Afghanistan . \u201c That said , this new war will present an opportunity for the companies that have a resident train and advising capability to contribute to this new effort . \u201d\nPresident Obama has asked Congress to authorize $ 500 million to train a new Syrian opposition out of Saudi Arabia . That money would be part of a $ 5 billion fund Obama requested this spring from Congress to help train and equip U.S. allies to fight terrorists .\nOne U.S. military contractor working in Iraq who asked not to be named said , \u201c I can tell you the contractor-expat community is abuzz thinking this will lead to more work . We expect a much larger footprint than he is showing right now . \u201d\nThose expectations were whet earlier this summer , as ISIS was gaining ground in northern Iraq and the first U.S. special operations teams were arriving in Iraq , when the Pentagon asked military contractors to participate in two important surveys .\nThe first one , issued in July , asked the industry to give a rough estimate of the costs associated with building a new network of ten ground based communications satellite stations , known as VSATs in military lingo . VSATs were used by the U.S. military in the last decade throughout Iraq to provide forward operating bases with secure internet and voice communications .\nThe second one was more specific . It asked for estimates of the cost for \u201c Security Assistance Mentors and Advisers \u201d for Iraq \u2019 s ministry of defense and the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service .\nA Pentagon spokeswoman told the \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the notice was not meant to be a request for proposal or the formal opening of the bidding process , but rather a chance to gauge the interest and capabilities of contractors down the road .\nBut contractors tell The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that these bureaucratic notices\u2014plus a pledge from Obama to wage a long war against ISIS and train up Syrian and Iraqi fighters\u2014represent a business opportunity for an industry that has shrunk in recent years .\nIn 2008 there were 242,558 contractors working in the countries for U.S. Central Command , the area that includes Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Somalia , Pakistan and Yemen , three countries where the United States has helped train local forces and conducted air strikes , according to the Pentagon \u2019 s official estimate .\nThat was during the height of the last round of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . By this July , that number had shrunk to 66,123 , according to the Pentagon \u2019 s latest estimate of military contractors working in the countries covered by Central Command , with only 14,634 contractors operating outside of Afghanistan .\nBut that \u2019 s only a fraction of America \u2019 s privatized security apparatus operating overseas . The State Department also offers billions of dollars to conduct security for diplomats and other officials . In 2011 , the State Department awarded Triple Canopy a four year deal worth up to $ 1.5 billion to provide security for the airport in Baghdad , U.S. diplomats and other Americans in the country . A State Department audit of the contract ( PDF ) found that at a minimum the State Department overpaid for those services by millions .\n\u201c There has been consolidation after conflicts , \u201d said Doug Brooks , the president emeritus of the International Stability Operations Association , a trade association for professional military contractors . \u201c There is going to be business , you could say these are shoes instead of boots on the ground . But as in most cases these are going to be local faces who will be hired by these companies , who bring professionalism and training .

It won \u2019 t be like the past ten years , but there will be growth in services . \u201d\nThe shrinking market for military contractors led some of them to seek new patrons . In 2010 , for example , an African based military contractor named Saracen began training an anti-piracy force in Somalia with funding from the United Arab Emirates .

The presence of U.S. forces overseas presents a number of opportunities for military contractors in providing everything from the dining facilities to the logistical transport for U.S. soldiers at war .\nAlso the budgets to fight al Qaeda and other groups expanded dramatically after 9/11 when many government institutions did not know exactly how to fight the new war . Blackwater\u2014the private military firm founded by former NAVY SEAL Erik Prince\u2014became a virtual extension of the CIA \u2019 s special activities division working to develop the deadly capability to target and kill al Qaeda operatives all over the world .\nIt was also Blackwater contractors working in Iraq to protect diplomatic convoys that shot what the Iraqi government said were 17 innocent protestors in the heart of Baghdad at Nisour Square .
