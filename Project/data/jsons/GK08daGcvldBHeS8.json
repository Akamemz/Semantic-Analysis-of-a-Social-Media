He proposes \u201cpreserving the American way of life\u201d as the new why of the Republican Party.\n\nKlingenstein\u2019s essay sets a powerful frame for understanding America\u2019s escalating ideological divide. To succeed, we must combine his attention to mission with two other ingredients: urgency and vision.\n\nThis week, of all weeks, it should be obvious to anyone paying attention that we cannot take for granted America\u2019s continued success as a nation. Yet many Republicans have a situational understanding of America that is stuck in the 1990s. The rise of Trump shook things up, but the prevailing party Zeitgeist remains high on Chamber of Commerce talking points and end-of-history self-satisfaction. Party leaders come across as complacent, stale, and unserious. Where is the sense of urgency?\n\nThink about what\u2019s gone down just in the last 90 days.\n\nA global pandemic followed by two months of quarantines.\n\n40 million job losses with new claims every week. 40 million!\n\nTrillions of dollars of new debt and stimulus spending, dollars as well-spent as Iraq War spending.\n\nRiots fueled by leftwing extremists in urban centers across the U.S.\u2014including my D.C. neighborhood, in which a car crashed on a street corner where I walk with my toddler son.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize awarded to the 1619 Project, agitprop that fundamentally challenges and opposes the founding premise of the United States.\n\nGeopolitical flexing from China, a communist-led regime that will soon overtake us as the world\u2019s largest economy (a bigger threat than the Soviet Union ever was).\n\nMore evidence showing how the FBI and intelligence community were weaponized to undermine Trump and remove Michael Flynn.\n\nIt\u2019s been wild to observe all of this. Police have gone from cracking down on haircuts to putting down a nationwide insurrection. The nation\u2019s capital is still smoldering as I write this, and Republican senators are tweeting platitudes blaming all sides of the political spectrum for the riots.\n\nThe 1/2 Blackpill Moment\n\nFor many this is a blackpill moment. It is tempting to swallow this pill and embrace Aris Roussinos\u2019s conclusion that \u201cAmerica is a failed state.\u201d But though Roussinos\u2019s diagnosis is apt, his conclusion goes too far. Going full blackpill seems irresponsible, an abdication of our children\u2019s future and our nation\u2019s history. There\u2019s something juvenile and too easy about swallowing it whole. It also strikes me as misinformed.\n\nNo, America is not a failed state. But here\u2019s the thing: we must act like it could become one. Because it could! We must take half of the blackpill. It is only by acknowledging that America could swiftly collapse that we can muster the urgency and seriousness needed to preserve the American way of life. The GOP needs to embrace this threat awareness in our collective nervous system. Like Israel, we must think of ourselves as under ongoing existential threat\u2014because we are. No more denial and complacency.\n\nThus, any new GOP mission must be combined with a sense of visceral emergency and a style of politics that recognizes the fragility of the situation, not just in America but across Western democracies.

MAGA says again, while Klingenstein talks about preserving. Klingenstein indulges in nostalgia in the way he describes the American way of life. For him it is an idealized version of the culture and values of the Greatest Generation. Even the image on his post\u2014presumably chosen by editors\u2014reinforces mid-20th century nostalgia.
