    "content": "Congress narrowly passed its budget Thursday , a key step in giving the GOP a green light to pass a tax bill with only Republicans votes .\nIn other words , Republicans , eager for a legislative win on taxes by the end of the year , are officially at the starting line to aggressively begin negotiations on tax reform .\nBut there is still a long road ahead . President Donald Trump says he will sign \u201c maybe the biggest tax cut we 've ever had , \u201d and top Republicans keep pledging he will do it by Christmas . He has promised he will help the middle class , make the United States more competitive internationally , and bring almost unprecedented economic growth in the years to come . And he \u2019 s promised to eliminate the federal debt in eight years while he \u2019 s at it .\nSatisfying every one of those promises is politically impossible , but even coming anywhere close to it in the next two months will be extremely difficult . Though congressional Republicans are saying tax reform will be \u201c easier \u201d than health care , the party is already embroiled in an intraparty struggle over how deeply to cut rates \u2014 and how to pay for them . And despite months of negotiations between top House and Senate Congress members and members of Trump \u2019 s administration \u2014 a working group dubbed the \u201c Big Six \u201d \u2014 Republicans haven \u2019 t actually agreed on many important points . And what they have agreed on has already raised some eyebrows within the Republicans conference .\n\u201c When you have a very slim majority \u2014 three of four senators ... control the destiny of tax reform and [ that \u2019 s ] just unacceptable for the American people , \u201d Rep. Jim Renacci ( R-OH ) , who sits on the tax-focused House Ways and Means and Budget committees , said .\nOvercoming these hurdles will be difficult , and the margin of error for Republicans is slim.Here \u2019 s a clear guide to what Republicans need to do .\nPhase 1 : before cutting taxes , Republicans need to pass a budget ( Done . )\nLike their strategy with Obamacare repeal , congressional Republicans are planning to pass their tax plan through a congressional loophole \u2014 \u201c budget reconciliation \u201d \u2014 which allows Congress to pass bills with a simple majority ( 51 votes ) and bypass the threat of a Democratic filibuster .\nTo pass anything through budget reconciliation , Republicans needed to pass a budget resolution \u2014 a nonbinding agreement that establishes \u201c instructions \u201d for reconciliation bills . These instructions give Republicans a green light to move a tax bill and , depending on how strictly they are written , can also dictate how deeply Republicans can cut tax rates .\nRepublicans in both the House and Senate have now passed the same budget \u2014 narrowly . The reconciliation instructions only mandated savings for one committee : $ 1 billion from the Natural Resources Committee . It \u2019 s rumored this will likely come from a bill to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . Notably the budget did not mandate spending cuts to reduce the deficit , instead allowing for a $ 1.5 trillion increase to the deficit over the next 10 years .\nIn other words , this budget gives Republicans the freedom to make deep tax cuts without having to pay for them .\nThe $ 1.5 trillion deficit increase prompted some to vote against the budget altogether . In the Senate , there was only one holdout , Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) who opposed the budget resolution because of its impact on the deficit \u2014 the budget \u2019 s proposal for defense spending was too high , he said .\nBut in the House there were 20 Republicans who voted against the resolution . Some of these \u201c no \u201d votes were over the deficit , but most were representatives from New York and New Jersey , in a symbolic vote against the state of tax reform negotiations themselves .\nIn late September , Republicans in the House and Senate released a vague framework \u2014 which calls for a substantial cut to the corporate tax rate , a huge expansion of the standard deduction , and a collapse of individual tax rates into three tax brackets instead of the current seven . ( They have also proposed a possible fourth top tax bracket . ) But within that framework , there is a lot Republicans don \u2019 t agree on .\nThe GOP has a general idea to cut tax rates and somehow pay for them by getting rid of deductions , loopholes and benefits . But as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Andrew Prokop explained , Republicans are having a hard time deciding which loopholes , deductions , and benefits they are willing to do away with .\nAlready there are signs of Republican defections from the framework alone . Retiring Sen. Bob Corker ( R-TN ) said he wont vote for anything that will add a `` penny '' to the deficit ( though he left the door open to some rosy economic projections called \u201c dynamic scoring \u201d ) and Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) has signaled he won \u2019 t vote for a plan that he thinks hurts the middle class .\nBut proposed plans to pay for the tax cut aren \u2019 t seeing much traction . For example , the state and local tax deduction ( SALT ) , which allows Americans to write off their property and state income taxes , already has Republican members from mostly Democratic states like New York , California , and New Jersey grumbling .\nAlready a number of Republican representatives from New Jersey and New York voted against the budget for this reason \u2014 an early signal of a major debate ahead .\nAccording to the Tax Policy Center , a full repeal of SALT would raise $ 1.3 trillion in revenue over the next decade \u2014 which would go a long way for Republicans who are limited in how much they can blow a hole in the deficit . Now there are rumors of a rolled-back SALT , which might be easier for moderate Republicans to swallow .\nAnd Trump isn \u2019 t making any of this easier . He has been relatively incoherent on the specific policy goals of tax reform and instead has set lofty expectations that Congress will likely fail to achieve .\nMost recently , reports indicated that Trump grew angry when he learned the tax framework would negatively impact the middle class \u2014 a complaint similar to that of his newfound golfing buddy Rand Paul \u2014 and allegedly called for some adjustments to the framework .\nPhase 3 : actually go through regular order \u2014 or so they say\nNow Republicans have managed to agree on and pass a budget , they have find some consensus , they have to actually write and pass their tax bill . Though technically Republicans have until the end of the next fiscal year \u2014 September 30 , 2018 \u2014 to pass this tax reform with the set of reconciliation instructions set up by the House and Senate budgets , they have said they \u2019 re going to get this done by the end of this year .\nRep. Kevin Brady ( R-TX ) , who chairs the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee , said the full Republican tax plan wouldn \u2019 t be unveiled until after the House and Senate agreed on a budget , putting more of a squeeze on the calendar . Now , the House says it will release their bill on Nov. 1 .\nHouse and Senate leadership has promised that tax reform will go through the full committee treatment , especially after the closed-door process for Obamacare repeal ultimately led some Republicans to vote against the health bill altogether earlier this year .\nIn the House , this will be the charge of Brady \u2019 s Ways and Means Committee , and in the Senate , Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) will be the chief tax reform negotiator in the Finance Committee . An open process means long committee meetings to debate and \u201c mark up \u201d any tax reform bill . Expect a lot of amendments . Eventually committees will have to vote on the bills , and then they will go to the full chamber floors .\nIf the House and Senate end up disagreeing and passing different bills , then they will have to form yet another \u201c conference committee \u201d to negotiate and create a new bill that both the House and the Senate will have to pass again . Or one chamber could simply take the other chamber \u2019 s bill and pass it .\nPhase 4 : get this bill through the Senate \u2019 s obscure budget rules \u2014 which is the really hard part\nAt some point after Republicans reconcile their differences and fend off enough outside interests to actually write a bill , the Congressional Budget Office and the Senate parliamentarian are going to have to weigh in on this whole process \u2014 a step that could completely derail Republicans \u2019 efforts .\nBecause Republicans are adamant about driving a partisan-led tax reform effort through budget reconciliation , they are not allowed to increase the deficit outside the first 10-year window , according to Senate rules .\nThey could pass sweeping tax cuts that will sunset after 10 years . This is what former President George W. Bush did with his tax cuts under budget reconciliation in 2001 , essentially getting around the deficit restriction by making the tax cuts temporary . Republicans , given all the pressures on this bill , might be forced to do the same . They could pass much smaller tax cuts that are permanent . If Republicans decided that making tax cuts permanent is more of priority than deeply slashing the rates , they could theoretically find enough revenue raisers and offsets to pass permanent \u2014 bust substantially smaller \u2014 tax cuts . It \u2019 s unlikely conservatives will sign up for this . Already House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-NC ) has drawn a red line at the 20 percent corporate tax rate . Anything above that means it \u2019 s likely a lot of conservative members won \u2019 t vote for the bill . Technically , Republicans could also split up their tax bill into three separate titles : One would be a temporary Republican-led effort that would pursue aggressive tax cuts and have to sunset in 10 years ; a second would be permanent and comply with Senate rules ; and the third would be a permanent bipartisan proposal needing 60 votes and likely find consensus around issues like the child tax credit . By going this route , Republicans would be able to split the impact of the deficit between budget reconciliation bills and regular order . Some analysts have also floated the nuclear option , in which McConnell just overrules the Senate parliamentarian . McConnell did not do this in the health care debate , but some have theorized there is more pressure for him to go to extreme lengths this time . Along these lines , the Senate Budget Committee could also use a different , more ideologically conservative score of their tax plan instead of the CBO \u2019 s evaluation .\nThere is also the fifth option : Republicans could just abandon the whole effort . Because they failed so spectacularly on Obamacare repeal , this option is looking unlikely .\nIn any scenario , they will be relying on projections of increased economic growth from tax cuts to offset the revenue losses from those cuts , known as \u201c dynamic scoring. \u201d But even under the rosiest of projections , growth alone won \u2019 t be enough to offset the full losses from the deepest cuts Republicans have proposed . A large contingent of economists \u2014 and even some Republicans themselves \u2014 have already called these growth projections unrealistic . Many are skeptical whether the Senate Parliamentarian will accept those growth numbers .\nThe CBO \u2019 s score of the bill will play a big role in estimating the effects of this tax package , and how the Senate Parliamentarian , whose role it is to advise whether or not bills adhere to budgetary procedure , will rule .\nAlready the deficit question is looking like it will be a massive challenge . As I explained above , some of the proposals in the tax reform framework are already showing that they will increase the deficit by trillions of dollars . Changes to the corporate tax rate , for example , would cost more than $ 4.1 trillion from 2028 to 2037 , according to the Tax Policy Center .\nIt \u2019 s all a question of which tricks Republicans will be allowed to sneak through the Senate and how ambitious they plan to be with reforming the tax code . Whichever path they chose , however , there will be roadblocks ahead .",
