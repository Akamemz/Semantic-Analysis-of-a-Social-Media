Famously touchy and unable to endure serious scrutiny , he has always been litigious \u2014 although , as journalist Tim O \u2019 Brien has pointed out based on Trump \u2019 s failed suit against him , sometimes unsuccessfully so . Imagine that tendency , now with executive powers , a compliant attorney general , and a lily-livered Congress . Trump \u2019 s reign will probably be awash in investigations and prosecutions of journalists for doing their jobs , stirring up the ugliest of class wars along the way . \u2026 So , we can expect President Trump to lie to the media , manipulate reality , and go after those who upset the notion that adulation is his birthright .\nOn the other hand , Politico writer Jack Shafer claims that Trump will offer journalism opportunities like never before because now reporters won \u2019 t be bound by the usual inside-the-Beltway rules and decorum .\nIf Trump \u2019 s idea of a news conference is to spank the press , if his lieutenants believe the press needs shutting down , if his chief of staff wants to speculate about moving the White House press scrum off the premises , perhaps reporters ought to take the hint and prepare to cover his administration on their own terms . Instead of relying exclusively on the traditional skills of political reporting , the carriers of press cards ought to start thinking of covering Trump \u2019 s Washington like a war zone , where conflict follows conflict , where the fog prevents the collection of reliable information directly from the combatants , where the assignment is a matter of life or death . In his own way , Trump has set us free . Reporters must treat Inauguration Day as a kind of Liberation Day to explore news outside the usual Washington circles . He has been explicit in his disdain for the press and his dislike for press conferences , prickly to the nth degree about being challenged and known for his vindictive way with those who cross him . So , forget about the White House press room . It \u2019 s time to circle behind enemy lines . \u2026 Opportunities to ignore the White House minders and investigate Trump announce themselves almost daily . \u2026 It \u2019 s not winter that \u2019 s coming with the inauguration of Trump .

Our humble submission and respect . Sort of like what a dog gives his master when he comes home at night . Or the touch of the cap the lower classes used to give the upper classes in days gone by . Trump wants figuratively , if not literally , a nod of the head , a bend of the knee , a curtsy . A recognition that even though approximately 3 million more Americans voted for his opponent , he deserves not only our submission , but our humble submission .\nWe do not fight against the things we hate .
