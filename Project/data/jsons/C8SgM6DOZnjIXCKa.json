Two weeks ago he noticed an extra $ 100 in his bimonthly pay check , courtesy of sweeping tax cuts passed by the Republican Congress late last year .\nMarran says the extra cash is nice , but it will not change his life .\n\u201c A lot of people around here think ( the tax cuts ) were a giveaway to the rich , \u201d said Marran , 56 , a resident of this city of 14,000 about 30 miles southwest of Pittsburgh .\nJust up the street , George Smith , an optician who makes $ 55,000 a year , echoed that sentiment . Taking a pull from a cigarette , the Trump voter said he is now getting an extra $ 120 a month in his paycheck . But he says it is the wealthy who really scored .\n\u201c It \u2019 s almost like being thrown a bone , \u201d said Smith , 59 .\nThese are worrying words for the GOP , which is banking on the tax cuts pushed by President Trump to help Republicans retain control of the House and Senate in midterm elections this November .\nA crucial early test is set for March 13 here in western Pennsylvania . Republican candidate Rick Saccone , a conservative Trump loyalist , is vying to win a special election for a congressional seat in a district that the president won by 19 points in 2016 .\nYet recent polls show a tightening race in Pennsylvania \u2019 s 18th district , where Republicans typically enjoy a double-digit advantage .\nPolitical analysts point to a number of factors fueling a competitive race , including Trump \u2019 s low approval ratings and heightened Democratic enthusiasm . Democratic challenger Conor Lamb , a retired Marine and former federal prosecutor , is running as a moderate in a district where liberals are viewed with suspicion .\nSaccone , meanwhile , has been touting Trump \u2019 s signature legislative achievement as a boon for the middle class . \u201c Tax cuts are changing lives , \u201d says one of Saccone \u2019 s TV spots . But it remains to be seen whether the four-term state representative can persuade tax-cut skeptics such as Marran and Smith .\nSuch doubts are reflected in a new nationwide \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos public opinion poll that shows a plurality believe the legislation is a windfall for the wealthy and big businesses .\nSome 36 percent of respondents said the rich would benefit most , while another 22 percent said it would be U.S. corporations . Just 13 percent said they believed that the middle class would be the main beneficiaries .\nThe poll also suggests that the tax plan alone may not fuel Republican turnout in November . Some 55 percent of respondents said the tax plan \u201c makes me more interested in voting for Democrats \u201d or \u201c will not change my interest in voting . \u201d\nIn interviews with 30 voters in Pennsylvania \u2019 s 18th district , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found most were ambivalent about the tax cuts . Most acknowledged they would keep more of what they earned . But that did not necessarily translate into support for the legislation or for Saccone , the Republican congressional candidate .\nTrump voters Marran and Smith said they were still undecided about next month \u2019 s contest . In Upper St. Clair , a wealthy Pittsburgh suburb , Republican Bill Hartman , 59 , said he plans to cast a vote for Lamb . This despite the fact that Hartman \u2019 s top tax bracket will drop to 25 percent from 28 percent .\nA window announcing support for Congressional candidate Rick Saccone is seen on High Street in Waynesburg , Pennsylvania , U.S. , February 14 , 2018 .

He said he is voting for Saccone .\n\u201c This gives the middle class more money , which will make people more willing to spend money , \u201d Laufer said .\nTax cuts should play well with voters here , most of whom will benefit .
