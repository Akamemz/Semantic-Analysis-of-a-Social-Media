Failing to get the Republican House to grant permission to recess , the Senate formally convened and adjourned multiple times . Indeed , each time the Senate adjourned , it stipulated that no business would be conducted when it reconvened three days later .\nA typical pro forma session on Jan. 6 , 2012 , opened with a Senate clerk reading aloud a letter from the Senate 's senior member appointing another senator , James Webb from nearby Virginia , to chair the day 's business . Webb then immediately adjourned the Senate session .\nThat session lasted all of 30 inconsequential seconds . Pretty much the norm for that period . But the legality of those brief sessions is the heart of the dispute before the Supreme Court now .\nThe president contends that these sessions were , in essence , fakes \u2014 a legal pretense \u2014 when in fact the Senate was really in recess .\nIt was during one of these pro forma sessions that President Obama nominated three people to fill long-vacant seats on the National Labor Relations Board . The nominees would serve until the end of the following year or longer if confirmed .\nPart of the reason Obama used the recess appointment mechanism was that Senate Republicans had dragged their feet on so many appointments that the board , charged with enforcing labor laws , did not have a quorum to do its job , and the Supreme Court in 2010 had said the board could not act without a quorum .\nOnce the recess appointees began their work hearing labor cases , a soda pop bottling company named Noel Canning challenged an adverse ruling , contending that the board 's members were unconstitutionally appointed .\nNoel Canning won in the U.S. Court of Appeals based in Washington , D.C. Now the company , backed by 44 Republican senators , is asking the Supreme Court to affirm its lower court win . The company will argue that the Senate makes its own rules , the Senate was not in recess at the time of the appointments , and that , therefore , the president had no power to make the recess appointments .\nArticle II of the Constitution states : `` The President shall have the power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , '' and that the appointment shall automatically expire at the end of the next year if the nominee is not confirmed .\nTexas A & M professor George Edwards points out that , at the time the Constitution was written , the only transportation available was by horse and carriage , not planes , trains or automobiles .\n`` There would be substantial periods when the Senate was not there to advise and consent on a presidential nomination , '' Edwards says . `` The Founding Fathers did n't want there to be gaps in the administration of policy , so they provided for recess appointments . ''\nToday , in contrast , senators can get to Washington quickly . The nature of government , however , is also dramatically different .\nEdwards notes that the founders could not have conceived of government of the scale that we have today . `` The government is much larger now . There are many more people in appointed positions and so many more vacancies that occur , '' he says .\nEdwards says that since the mid-1800s , there have been more than 600 recess appointments to civilian jobs , and hundreds , perhaps thousands more in the military . Even some Supreme Court justices were first recess-appointed . Chief Justice Earl Warren was recess-appointed after the sitting chief justice died in September 1953 . Warren served in that capacity for six months before he was confirmed by the Senate in March 1954 .\nIn modern times , three appeals courts have upheld the president 's power to make midsession recess appointments . In this case , however , the Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion , siding with the Noel Canning company .\nNoel Francisco , the company 's lawyer , contends that the importance of these appointments proves his point : `` That 's precisely why the recess appointments power was meant to be a narrow emergency power . ''\nWhite House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler disagrees . In an interview with NPR , she said that the way Senate Republicans managed to keep the Senate in session without actually handling any formal business proves her point \u2014 that the Senate sessions were nothing more than a `` legal fiction . ''\n`` [ The Senate ] was not conducting any business and did not intend to conduct any business during these pro forma sessions , '' Ruemmler said . `` It was solely employed , and members of the Senate have been quite clear about that , for the purpose of preventing the president from making recess appointments .\n`` It is not a bypass of the Senate confirmation process , '' she added . `` It is a way for the president ... by express authority in the Constitution , to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed . '' That is something that she maintains can not be done if many top federal agency positions are allowed to remain unfilled .\nRuemmler contends that if Senate Republicans prevail here , the recess appointment power will likely be dead for all practical purposes . The Senate , after all , could eat up every recess with pro forma sessions to prevent presidential appointments .\nNoel Francisco readily concedes this point . `` The fact of the matter is that in today 's day and age , the Senate is virtually never incapable of providing advice and consent given modern transportation and communications , '' he says . `` So , yes , the Senate can render itself perpetually available to provide advice and consent , and if it does so , the president is not empowered to make a recess appointment . ''\nA second question before the Supreme Court in this case asks when the vacancy must arise to trigger the president 's recess appointment power .\nThe recess appointment clause says the president may make appointments for vacancies `` that may happen during the recess .
