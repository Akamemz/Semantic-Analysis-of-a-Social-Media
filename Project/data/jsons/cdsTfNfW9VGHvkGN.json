With Covid-19 cases in the thousands , Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state \u2019 s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state .\nIt was a meeting only in name . Republicans , who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly , sent just one member . He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor \u2019 s request . It took just 17 seconds . In the Republican-controlled state senate , the same thing happened , according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . It took even less time .\nThe legislature \u2019 s defiance was a naked display of unabashed power \u2013 an elected body refusing its governor \u2019 s request and turning its back on its constituents in a time of crisis .\nI don \u2019 t think many people who are aware of what \u2019 s going on would say that it \u2019 s anything even resembling a democracy Jay Heck of Common Cause\nThe Republican lawmakers who didn \u2019 t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power . Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting , it was a stunning series of events .\nThat assault on democracy began in 2011 , when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin . It was part of a national Republican effort , called Project Redmap , to capture state legislatures and , with those victories , to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district . The goal of Redmap was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats \u2013 a process called gerrymandering . The writer and author David Daley called Project Redmap \u201c the most audacious political heist of modern times \u201d .\nKarl Rove , former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal , claiming , rightly , that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress . Later , according to the New Yorker , when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas , he said \u201c People call us a vast rightwing conspiracy . But we \u2019 re really a half-assed rightwing conspiracy . Now it \u2019 s time to get serious . \u201d\nWisconsin proves it : Republicans will sacrifice voters ' health to keep power Read more\nFor $ 1.1m \u2013 a small sum in campaign dollars \u2013 Republicans won the state legislature and went on to curb Democratic power by passing a strict voter ID law , making it harder for minorities and students to vote , and later stripped statewide elected officials of some of their authority .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think many people who are aware of what \u2019 s going on , and are tuned into politics and government in this state , would say that it \u2019 s anything even resembling a democracy , \u201d said Jay Heck , the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause , a government watchdog group .\nOn Tuesday , voters risked their lives to go to the polls , waiting hours in line in Milwaukee . So far , turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016 , and that is believed to benefit Republicans , who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court . It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers \u2019 last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward .\nWisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state , and there had been fights over redistricting before . But in 2011 , Republicans took it to a new level . They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol , where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts . They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn , even requiring Republican lawmakers to sign agreements to keep discussions about the maps secret .\nRepublicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year . \u201c The maps we pass will determine who \u2019 s here 10 years from now , \u201d one memo at the time read . One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen , a Democrat in the state general assembly , was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts , Daley wrote in Ratf * * ked : Why Your Vote Doesn \u2019 t Count .\nThe plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted . In 2012 , the first election with the new map in place , Republicans won less than half the votes , but conquered 60 of the state \u2019 s 99 assembly seats . The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016 , despite earning just over 50 % of the statewide vote .\nRepublicans could act brazenly without fear because gerrymandered maps make it impossible for them to lose their majority Michael Li , a voting rights expert at the Brennan Center at NYU\n\u201c It seems impervious to what happens with voters , \u201d said Barry Burden , director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . \u201c It really looks like an unresponsive institution . \u201d\nMichael Li , a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU , wrote this week : \u201c Wisconsin \u2019 s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a minority of the vote .\n\u201c Republicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority , \u201d he wrote . Wisconsin \u2019 s maps were crafted with such micro-precision that even if Democrats managed to win a historically high 54 % of the two-party vote \u2013 a level they \u2019 ve reached only once in the last 20 years \u2013 Republicans would still end up with a solid nine-seat majority in the state assembly . \u201d\nAs the gerrymandering project wore on in 2011 , Republicans also drafted one of the strictest voter ID laws in the country .
