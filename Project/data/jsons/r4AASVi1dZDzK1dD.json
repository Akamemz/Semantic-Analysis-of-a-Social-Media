    "content": "AUGUSTA \u2014 As Joshua Rothman read Gov . Paul LePage \u2019 s statements about drug dealers impregnating \u201c young white \u201d girls Thursday night , the University of Alabama professor heard echoes of rhetoric and racial stereotypes all too common in American history .\n\u201c The idea that black men are coming to take advantage of white women is something that goes back to slavery \u2026 and it is a dangerous one , \u201d said Rothman , who specializes in slavery and racial history at a university where one of the pivotal moments in integration of schools in the South played out .\nWhile LePage sought to explain away the statement as a slip-up , not a racial statement , Rothman and other political observers say such incidents \u2013 whether by LePage , Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump or others \u2013 and the divergent public reaction to them are signs of how racial language has changed as American politics becomes more polarized .\n\u201c It used to be people would say things that were crazy \u2013 almost explicitly racist \u2013 and they \u2019 d be done , \u201d Rothman said . \u201c And that doesn \u2019 t happen anymore . If anything , it makes them stronger . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s dominance in the polls on the national stage has surprised many people \u2013 including national Republican leaders \u2013 given his penchant for bombastic comments , whether about banning all Muslims from entering the U.S. or claims that killers and rapists are crossing the southern border from Mexico .\nBut in many ways , Trump is following the same path that led LePage to the Blaine House by tapping into the deep-seated frustration or , sometimes , fears of more conservative voters . And while politicians may offend some voters with statements viewed as \u201c politically incorrect \u201d or even racist , they hit the mark with other Americans tired of polished politicians and well-rehearsed sound bites .\nWilliam Galston , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington , D.C. , who researches the implications of political polarization , said the anti-politically correct rhetoric from politicians such as Trump and LePage has given an outlet to people .\n\u201c A lot of people have felt silenced by powerful , elite social norms and so they bit their tongue , but they haven \u2019 t changed their minds , \u201d Galston said . \u201c Now , politicians come along that make it acceptable to not only harbor these sentiments but also to articulate them . \u201d\nLePage said during a news conference Friday that he wasn \u2019 t \u201c smart enough \u201d to deliberately tap old racial tensions about black men and white women and , instead , attempted to turn the equation around by blaming his critics and a Maine media he readily dismisses as biased for drawing that connection .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a polished speaker , but I have a heart , I have a heart for Maine and Maine people , \u201d LePage said Friday , later adding , \u201c If you want to make it racist , go right ahead , do whatever you want . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s still unclear how LePage \u2019 s statements will play out in Maine . Six years of prior incidents involving the impolitic governor suggest , however , that it will only deepen the divide between LePage lovers and haters in the state , just as Trump \u2019 s success to date in the reality-show-like Republican primary campaign is revealing the divide on a national level .\nAmerican politics have changed , and few political observers would say for the better . But they say there are legitimate reasons why blunt-talking politicians such as Trump , LePage and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie on the right \u2013 and on the left the self-proclaimed \u201c Democratic socialist \u201d presidential candidate , Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2013 resonate with some voters .\n\u201c There are a lot of disenchanted people in the country , \u201d said Galston . \u201c You have a substantial chunk of the population that has made almost no economic progress in nearly 20 years , and that isn \u2019 t the way it was supposed to be in their standpoint . \u201d\nCombine that economic stagnation with changing demographics and the fear of terrorism ( or , perhaps in Maine \u2019 s case , the growing heroin crisis ) and Galston said you have a frightening mix that is ripe for the political picking . The blunter the politicians , the more popular they become , he said .\nTrump \u2019 s poll numbers , for instance , have risen from the mid-teens to the low 20s during the summer to more than 30 percent among Republican voters despite the seemingly nonstop media frenzy and controversies surrounding his campaign , according to polling averages compiled by RealClearPolitics . That is still only 30 percent of the 30 percent of Americans who identify as Republican , however .\nLePage had just a 32 percent approval rating and a 55 percent disapproval rating among participants in a Critical Insights poll in October 2015 , roughly one year after his re-election . But his base of supporters remains solid , judging by the often-favorable reactions from many who attend his town hall-style meetings around the state , including at last week \u2019 s event in Bridgton .\nA citizens group urging lawmakers to impeach LePage collected more than 20,000 signatures as of early last week . His comments on drug dealers are virtually guaranteed to come up if and when the Democratic-controlled House debates an impeachment order as early as this week . But supporters of impeachment were outnumbered by LePage supporters at two competing rallies held outside the State House last week . And even if the impeachment order passed the House \u2013 an unlikely scenario , given Democratic leadership \u2019 s opposition \u2013 it is likely dead-on-arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate .\nRep. Larry Lockman , an Amherst Republican and close LePage ally , dismissed any suggestions that LePage \u2019 s recent comments were racist and predicted on social media that they would only grow his support , especially in rural Maine .\n\u201c The LePage haters can \u2019 t even organize more than a dozen people for a rent-a-mob event at the Statehouse , \u201d Lockman wrote on Facebook , referring to the outnumbered pro-impeachment rally . \u201c LePage is more popular now than he was on election night . \u201d\nFor his part , LePage not only hasn \u2019 t changed his style since his first run for governor in 2010 but often appears to take pride in his brashness while openly disdaining \u201c political correctness. \u201d Like some other politicians , he has seized on the \u201c politically correct \u201d label \u2013 or PC \u2013 as a sign of weakness in other politicians and in the media .\nLast month , for instance , he or his staff posted a message on Twitter calling the media \u201c foolish \u201d in their interpretation of his giving a book titled \u201c If You \u2019 re Riding a Horse and It Dies , Get off \u201d to some Republican state lawmakers .\n\u201c The book wasn \u2019 t about 1 issue , rather how politicians are distracted by wrong solutions in order to be PC , \u201d read the tweet from the governor \u2019 s account .\nIn June , LePage decorated a fake Christmas tree with plastic pigs and pictures of lawmakers from both parties whom he accused of filling a budget with wasteful spending , or \u201c pork . \u201d\n\u201c I might not be politically correct because I choose not to be , but I \u2019 m honest , \u201d LePage told reporters .\nWhile his style has alienated some Maine voters , it has only endeared him more to others . LePage \u2019 s supporters , like Trump \u2019 s , relish his \u201c tell it like it is \u201d philosophy .\nFor proof , one need only look at the election results : LePage received 76,454 more votes in 2014 during his re-election campaign than he did in 2010 .\n\u201c The most important thing about Governor LePage is not that he was elected but that he was re-elected , \u201d said Galston , who is an acquaintance of two-time LePage rival Eliot Cutler and advised the No Labels campaign , in which the Democratic gubernatorial candidate , U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud , participated . \u201c He paid no penalty and , in fact , was rewarded for his speech and conduct . \u201d\nThe governor has found himself apologizing \u2013 or acknowledging he could have chosen better words \u2013 on numerous occasions during his five-plus years in office . Some of those comments have had a racial tinge , or at least were perceived so by his critics .\nAsked in January 2011 about the fact that NAACP leaders were upset that he declined invitations to attend Martin Luther King Jr. Day events , the governor replied , \u201c Tell them to kiss my butt. \u201d When those comments upset NAACP leaders even more , LePage dismissed the group as a \u201c special interest . \u201d\nHe also said as a candidate that he would tell President Obama to \u201c go to hell \u201d over fishing regulations and later reportedly said at a private Republican fundraiser in 2013 that the president \u201c hates white people . \u201d\nPart of what is going on , both in Maine and nationally , is that the polarization of the political process has coincided with the silo-ization of our political discourse .\nDaniel Shea , a professor and director of Colby College \u2019 s Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement , said the rise of \u201c news \u201d sources that lean toward one side of the political spectrum \u2013 whether talk radio for conservatives , blogs for liberals or each group \u2019 s respective cable TV network \u2013 has allowed Americans to hear only one side of an issue .\nThat creates an \u201c echo chamber \u201d that seems to encourage bombastic and vitriolic discourse because , as Shea put it , \u201c when we are exposed to other perspectives we are more likely to check our rhetoric . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s an issue on both sides of the aisle , Shea said .
