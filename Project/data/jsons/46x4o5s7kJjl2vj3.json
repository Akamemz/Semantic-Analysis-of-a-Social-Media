There were 208,000 new jobs created in July, and the economy grew at 3 percent. So why did the stock market take this as a signal to sell?\n\nLooking at the long-term economic indicators, more and more analysts see an asset bubble about to pop. When that happens, bad federal policies will take the blame.\n\nEconomists insist that we\u2019ve been in a \u201crecovery\u201d for several years, but it has never felt like a recovery. Economic growth, job creation and productivity figures have ranged from mediocre to awful. President Obama insisted that he would revive the economy by spending $1 trillion on stimulus.

Instead, the Federal Reserve is taking extraordinary measures to keep interest rates artificially low, masking the effects of massive government borrowing. Combine this policy with America\u2019s corporate-income tax, the highest effective rates in the developed world, and companies borrow \u201ccheap\u201d money and keep profits overseas.\n\nThat produces highly indebted corporations flush with cash.
