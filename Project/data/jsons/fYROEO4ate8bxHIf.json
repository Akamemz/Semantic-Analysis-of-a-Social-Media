And second , even if it succeeded legally\u2026 [ one former congressional staffer and a census expert doubts ] it would work logistically\u2026 There are many critiques of the Trump administration \u2019 s legal strategy in its quest to ask about citizenship on the 2020 census , but one can not fault its chutzpah . \u201d David A.

( It has been neither permitted or prohibited by SCOTUS . ) That \u2019 s a troubling concession , because Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court that using citizenship data for redistricting was not the purpose of the census citizenship question . Once again , Trump is telling a very different story from the narrative carefully crafted by DOJ attorneys\u2026 With every reversal and misrepresentation , the Trump administration is making it more difficult for Roberts to uphold the question under a new rationale. \u201d Mark Joseph Stern , Slate\n\u201c Trump has shown himself to be ignorant of what is at stake here . \u2018 I think it 's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal , \u2019 he said on Monday . \u2018 There 's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal. \u2019 In fact , the proposed citizenship question on the census does not inquire about immigration status . It only asks if a person is a US citizen . A person who answered \u2018 no \u2019 is not necessarily an undocumented immigrant -- he or she could be a green card holder or a foreign national on a work or student visa . How telling it is that Trump apparently equates all non-US citizens present in the country as \u2018 illegal \u2019 \u2026 The 2020 census is not Trump 's census , it is our census .
