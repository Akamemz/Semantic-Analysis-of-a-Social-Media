''\n`` What I would like him to do is let everyone get the benefit of his leadership . He scores very well in strong leader , and that 's what so many Americans are starving for , '' Conway told CNN 's Alisyn Camerota during a lengthy two-part interview on `` New Day . ''\nWhen Trump is able to give a speech `` in his own words , in his own delivery system , then people can actually focus on the content , '' Conway remarked , adding , `` I think that 's what 's so important . ''\nTrump has repeatedly bucked calls to rein in the kind of brash , aggressive rhetoric that has made even Republicans uncomfortable , though he has delivered several scripted policy speeches in recent weeks . \u201c I am who I am . It \u2019 s me , \u201d he told a Wisconsin TV station on Tuesday . \u201c I don \u2019 t wan na change . Everybody talks about , \u2018 Oh well , you \u2019 re gon na pivot , you \u2019 re gon na \u2019 \u2014 I don \u2019 t wan na pivot . I mean , you have to be you . If you start pivoting , you \u2019 re not being honest with people . \u201d\nConway suggested in Thursday 's interviews that the media was to blame for how Trump 's rhetoric has been perceived . `` If we 're going to cover campaigns as comedy shows \u2026 or no content , no substance , I think we 're doing a disservice to the voters , '' she told CNN . `` When people talk about a pivot , Alisyn , most of the advice he receives , whether it 's on TV or in person , is pivoting stylistically . But substantively , the issues , that benefits Donald Trump . ''\nAccounting for what will be different about the campaign in the weeks ahead , Conway said , `` we 're going to sharpen the message . ''\n`` And we 're going to make sure Donald Trump is comfortable about being in his own skin , that he does n't lose that authenticity that you simply ca n't buy and a pollster ca n't give you . And voters know if you 're comfortable in your own skin , '' she continued . `` And let him be him in this sense : He wants to deliver the speech , if he wants to go to a rally , if he wants to connect with the crowd in a way that 's very spontaneous , that 's wonderful . And that 's how he got here . That 's how he became the nominee in large part , Alisyn . But at the same time , we have some really serious , pressing problems in this country that I 'm hoping will start to be addressed more by the media . ''\nTrump delivered a speech on economic issues last week in Detroit , followed up by separate speeches on national security in Ohio and Michigan on Monday and Tuesday , as well as a campaign-rally address focused on law and order in Wisconsin . Conway exclaimed that she is `` thrilled we 've gotten so much coverage this week just on the first two speeches . ''\n`` You 'll see more of those , '' Conway promised . `` Next week is immigration week followed by education week . And we \u2019 re really excited about that . ''\nConway played up the campaign 's first general election ad buys set to start running later this week in Ohio , Pennsylvania , Florida , North Carolina and Virginia . She also revealed that the campaign will begin debate prep this weekend , though she would not say who would be playing the role of Hillary Clinton , only that `` it 's actually a wonderful choice . ''\n`` And I think he 'll be very happy with the choice . I wo n't say it because it 's private and confidential , '' she said , smiling . `` And we have many people who are willing to help . ''\nOn both CNN and on the set of `` CBS This Morning , '' Conway noted that Trump made no mention of her being a woman as reason for her promotion .\n`` I 'm told I 'm the first female Republican campaign manager in presidential political history and that tells you a lot about Donald Trump . It also tells you a great deal about him he never said that to me\u2014'hey , we 'd like a woman , are you available ? ' '' she remarked , responding specifically on CBS to a question about what Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , whom Conway supported in the primaries , does not know about Trump . `` I 'm there based on merit , but I think it 's symptomatic of who Donald Trump has been in his own corporation elevating and promoting women . ''\nShe also sought to dampen criticism of Trump 's new campaign CEO Stephen Bannon , who took a leave of absence from leading the far-right conservative Breitbart News empire .\nSeated across from Conway on set , CNN 's Camerota read a list of headlines from the website under Bannon , including `` There \u2019 s No Hiring Bias Against Women In Tech , They Just Suck At Interviews , '' `` Sympathy for the Devils : The Plot Against Roger Ailes \u2014 and America , '' `` Big Trans Hate Machine Targets Pitching Great Curt Schilling '' and `` Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy . ''\n`` So I have n't read those stories , '' Conway conceded , while adding , `` but I can tell you the man is a brilliant tactician . He has a long history of , I think , being unafraid . I 'll tell you what Donald Trump needs . He needs people who are like him in this sense : You have to be unapologetically , unflinchingly unafraid of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and all that Clinton campaign means . Because we feel like we 're up against a major machine here . And we -- you know , you need people girded for battle , who are at least willing to leave it all on the field , give it our best shot . ''\nMost reports of Trump 's campaign shakeup have seen the moves as a downgrade for his embattled chair Paul Manafort , who has faced a number of damaging reports in recent days about his links to pro-Russian figures in Ukraine . Trump has not yet defended Manafort -- and while the campaign has said he 's staying , it has n't publicly clarified who now reports to whom . Asked on CBS who has the final word , Conway said , \u201c I 'd say it is a combination of us . Trump has made it very clear who it is . \u201d\nPerhaps alluding to recent reports that have described the nominee as sullen and erratic behind closed doors , Conway took pains on both programs to emphasize that `` Mr. Trump is finding joy in the campaign trail . ''\n`` I 'm confident that he is finding joy on the job this week and he relishes being out there with the crowds and giving these speeches , '' whether as a scripted speech or in a rally setting , Conway told CBS . `` And you do n't see on the camera is also the local interviews , the meetings with families and other folks . ''\nWhile expressing confidence that Trump could remain on message , Conway added , `` But also the message has to be one of substance and it has to be about issues . ''\n`` I 'd rather lose a campaign where we put it all on the field substantively , where people saw the difference on the major issues of the day than when a campaign [ is ] based on style . If this is about style , he can go back to 'The Apprentice . ' That was fun and successful and lucrative for him , '' Conway said . `` But it \u2019 s not about style . ''",
