That's a big change for the American presidency, says Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies.\n\n\"If it's [Ronald] Reagan on a horse or [Bill] Clinton, the man from Hope [Ark.], there's always been this kind of visual narrative or this story that to be president you had to be able to handle the wilderness, be comfortable outside of the city.

This week the council put out a report documenting improvements in the agricultural economy.\n\nHome On The Range President Obama and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney both seem more urban than rural. But traditionally, it's been important for presidents to be \"comfortable outside the city,\" says Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies.
