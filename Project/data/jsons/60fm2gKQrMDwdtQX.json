    "content": "The Green Party Makes Its Case As A Left-Leaning Alternative To Obama\nLast week 's Political Junkie column ( `` Still Waiting For That Declaration of Independents '' ) talked about the lack of ballot alternatives to President Obama ( D ) and Mitt Romney ( R ) . If there is such dissatisfaction with the two major parties , I wondered , should n't there be greater support for a third party or independent presidential candidate ? The column also included a history of the Libertarian Party , which will appear on all 50 states ' ballots and which has been running presidential candidates since 1972 .\nThe focus on the Libertarians prompted a bunch of complaints that appeared in my in-box , mostly from those wondering why there was no mention of the Green Party .\nQ : I 'm wondering why in your column today you chose to analyze the Libertarians but made no mention of other third parties such as the Green Party ? I 've heard many a Democrat blame the Greens for 2000 when Nader pulled 90,000 votes in Florida and Gore lost by less than 5,000 . Not that I think Jill Stein will make the kind of splash that Nader did in 2000 , but I think it 's important for a truly informed public that the media play fair in the sandbox and at least mention everyone scrambling for ballot access this November . \u2014 Meghan Keegan , Albany , N.Y .\nQ : I hope you 'll find time to cover the left side of the political spectrum , such as Independent Rocky Anderson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein . No , Obama does n't count . \u2014 Bob Brister , Salt Lake City , Utah\nQ : Regarding the so-called lack of strong ballot choices , the Green Party 's Jill Stein has qualified for matching funds in 22 states . Would n't this be a `` strong candidate ? '' \u2014 Daniel Casey , Rogers , Minn .\nLet 's take some of these points one at a time .\nThe Green Party . The party 's platform is well to the left of the Ds and the Rs . At the risk of oversimplification \u2014 but borrowing from the party 's 2010 platform \u2014 the Greens support/want to :\nfree the political system from big money interests , saying serious campaign finance reform to be `` essential '' ;\nabolishing the electoral college and having direct election for president ;\nuniversal , federally funded childcare program for pre-school and young schoolchildren ;\nfree and equal airtime for all ballot-qualified candidates and parties , on TV and radio ;\n`` our government does not have the right to justify pre-emptive invasion of another country on the grounds that the other country harbors , trains , equips and funds a terrorist cell '' ;\n`` self-determination for both Palestinians and Israelis '' and an end to U.S. support for Israel ;\nfull investigation into `` war crimes '' committed in Palestine and Israel ;\na `` complete , thorough , impartial and independent investigation '' of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 `` including the role of the administration of George W. Bush , various U.S. based corporations and interests , and other nations and third parties '' ;\n`` end illegal government spying , including the use of warrantless wiretaps '' ;\nThe full text of the party 's 2010 platform can be found here .\nHistory of Green Party presidential candidates . The party was formed in 1991 . Its first presidential ticket was composed of Ralph Nader , the consumer activist , for president , and Winona LaDuke , a Native American and environmental activist , for vice president . The ticket got 684,902 votes , or just 0.7 percent of the total vote . Its strongest showing was in Oregon , where it won 3.6 percent of the vote .\nThe Greens stayed with Nader and LaDuke for 2000 , where their support swelled to 2,882,738 \u2014 some 2.7 percent of the total vote . Their best state , by far , was Alaska : more than 10 percent of the vote . One of their weakest states , by far , was Florida : 97,488 votes , or just 1.6 percent of the total . But the results in Florida are what got everyone 's attention ; many Democrats insist that Nader 's total was responsible for Al Gore losing the presidency , since George W. Bush won Florida ( and its 25 electoral votes ) by just 537 votes , and that had Nader not been on the Sunshine State ballot , an overwhelming amount of his 97,000 votes would have gone to Gore .\nNader decided in 2004 to run again as an independent and welcomed Green Party support . He even named Peter Camejo , a California Green Party member , as his running mate . But the Greens decided to go their own way and nominated David Cobb , a Texas activist , for president . The ticket of Cobb and Pat LaMarche got fewer than 120,000 votes nationwide . In 2008 , the Green Party ticket of Cynthia McKinney , an outspoken former congresswoman from Georgia , and Rosa Clemente , a community organizer from the Bronx , won about 162,000 votes .\nNader , running as an independent in 2004 , got 463,655 votes ( 0.38 percent ) . In 2008 , he tried the indie route once again , teaming up with Matt Gonzalez , a notable Green Party figure from San Francisco who came close against Gavin Newsom in the 2003 mayoral race . The Nader-Gonzalez ticket finished with 738,475 votes ( 0.56 percent ) .\n2012 Greens . The party is holding its nominating convention Saturday , July 14 in Baltimore . The favorite for the nomination is Dr. Jill Stein , an environmental-health advocate who sought the Massachusetts governorship in both 2002 and 2010 . She has already qualified for federal matching funds in 22 states . According to the Green Party website , Stein has 205 delegates ( as of July 3 ) and has a huge lead over actress Rosanne Barr , with 84 delegates . Three other candidates are well behind .\nRegarding the earlier mention of Rocky Anderson : He 's a former two-term mayor of Salt Lake City who won praise from progressives for his positions on gay rights , the environment , immigration and the war in Iraq . He also called for the impeachment of President George W. Bush . He left the Democratic Party in 2011 and is running for president this year as a candidate of the Justice Party , which is not expected to appear on many state ballots .\nThe presidential race , so far . Here 's my early look at the battle for 270 electoral votes . With less than four months to go , I have President Obama ahead with 247 electoral votes , to Mitt Romney 's 206 , with 85 electoral votes listed as tossup . Number in parenthesis is state 's e.v . 's .\nOBAMA ( 247 ) : California ( 55 ) , Connecticut ( 7 ) , Delaware ( 3 ) , D.C.

The bizarre tale of Rep. Thaddeus McCotter has apparently reached its conclusion four months earlier than anticipated . The five-term Michigan Republican , who inexplicably launched a bid for the presidential nomination last year only to watch it end in unsurprising failure , and who then inexplicably failed to get enough valid signatures to appear on the Aug. 7 primary ballot , and then declared but quickly rescinded his intention to run as a write-in , announced on Friday he was resigning , effective immediately . He said that the `` nightmarish month and a half '' had taken its toll on him and his family and that he had enough .\nIt 's taken a toll on political observers as well . Bill Ballenger , the eminent Michigan analyst , is quoted in the Detroit Free Press as calling l'affaire McCotter the `` ultimate disaster '' :\n`` The guy has just made one terrible blunder after another . ... In my view , this is the supreme self-centered act . He 's just caused more problems for everybody . At least the guy could have quietly kept his mouth shut and tried to pull everything together and serve out the rest of his term . ''\nThe only Republican on the Aug. 7 primary ballot is Kerry Bentivolio , a teacher and Tea Party activist . Former state Sen. Nancy Cassis ( R ) is running as a write-in candidate , and has received some high profile endorsements , including that of Oakland Co. Executive and former gov . candidate Brooks Patterson . The likely Democratic nominee is Dr. Syed Taj , but he faces a primary challenge from Bill Roberts , a supporter of Lyndon LaRouche . The 11th CD is still thought to be leaning Republican .\nAndy Griffith . Most people remember Andy Griffith as that likable character he played for years on TV , first as Sheriff Andy Taylor of the fictitious town of Mayberry , N.C. , and then as defense attorney Ben Matlock . But Democrats in in his home state of North Carolina remember him as a great party stalwart , always available for a rally or a speech . He never ran for office , but Democrats sure tried to get him to take on Sen. Jesse Helms ( R ) in 1990 . Here 's a little of what Rob Christensen of the Raleigh News & Observer had to say :\n`` Griffith , who died last week , was Tar Heel Democrats ' political ace in the hole , helping them remain competitive in the state while most of the South went Republican . Time and time again , Griffith , one of the most beloved figures in the state , would take to TV to endorse Democrats \u2013 appearing in political ads for Jim Hunt in his 1984 Senate race , for [ Mike ] Easley in the 2000 and 2004 governor races , for Bev Perdue in the 2008 governor 's race , and for state Senate candidates in various years . Normally an endorsement by a Hollywood star would n't mean much in a state political race . But Griffith was different . He lived in Manteo , not Los Angeles . And his role as the wise small-town Southern sheriff was an image that many people in the state identified with . ''\nPolitical Updates .
