The people tasked with protecting the community and enforcing the law transformed the small city into a mini-war zone , with explosions in the streets , assault rifles trained on unarmed protesters , rubber projectiles fired in abundance , and tear gas canisters fired through residential neighborhoods . Along the way they arrested a couple of journalists for no reason , threatened to arrest a few others , and deployed tear gas against a TV news crew .\nAnd they did all that in response to protests over the fatal shooting \u2013 by a police officer \u2013 of Michael Brown , an unarmed black teenager . Those protests escalated ( into riots and looting , in some cases ) after the police refused to release the name of the officer or any other information that might help explain why a young black man was killed at the hands of a police force that has long faced accusations of racial discrimination . After the governor stepped in and put the highway patrol in charge of security , the Ferguson police finally came forward with some information : the name of the officer who killed Brown , and a police report and video surveillance footage implicating Brown as a suspect in the robbery of a convenience store . Releasing the video only stoked further outrage , as it appeared that the Ferguson police were trying to disparage the character of the victim ( the police chief later acknowledged that the robbery had nothing to do with Brown 's shooting ) . The Justice Department had asked the police not to release the video out of concern that it would spark unrest .\nThat \u2019 s not a track record anyone can be proud of ( save for the St. Louis County police chief , who described the above actions as the product of \u201c a remarkable amount of restraint \u201d ) .
