Mr. Trump said his decision was \u201c based on the recommendation of the independent , bipartisan U.S. International Trade Commission , \u201d which ruled late last year that a \u201c surge \u201d of washing machines from Samsung and LG have \u201c seriously injured \u201d domestic manufacturers .\nIt was the first major trade restriction of his presidency , and the reaction overseas was swift .
