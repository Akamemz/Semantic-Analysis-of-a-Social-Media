But a lot will depend on whether Democrats think it \u2019 s less risky to nominate an old white guy instead of a younger woman of color , \u201d says Dianne Bystrom , a longtime observer of presidential campaigns and women in politics . \u201c It may come down to that . \u201d\nThe California senator \u2019 s struggles reflect the unwieldy nature of this historically large Democratic field . With 24 hopefuls traipsing around the early voting states and showing up at cattle calls , making an impression \u2013 even for the most promising contenders \u2013 is proving to be a real challenge . Senator Harris has also been faulted for \u201c pandering \u201d to the left and failing to communicate a core message . But for many Democratic voters , it may come down to the bottom line : Who can beat President Donald Trump ?\nKamala Harris connects well in person and on camera . At a campaign swing through California , she hugged , sashayed , and smiled her way through events . Her delivery is crisp and on point . Yet since launching her presidential campaign to great fanfare and an enormous crowd of 20,000 in Oakland , California , in January , she has been stuck in the lower tier of candidates . Recent polls show her support at or below 10 % .\nKamala Harris has always been a trailblazer . As the daughter of immigrant parents \u2013 her mother came from India and her father from Jamaica \u2013 she was the first woman elected ( twice ) as California \u2019 s attorney general , and the second African American woman elected to the United States Senate , which she entered two years ago . From the moment she got there , the chattering classes began speculating about White House ambitions .\nThose lofty expectations seemed justified when she launched her presidential campaign in Oakland , California , in January , drawing an enormous crowd of about 20,000 people . She \u2019 s since brought in some big endorsements , including California Gov . Gavin Newsom , and an impressive fundraising haul .\nWhat Senator Harris hasn \u2019 t been able to do of late is break past 10 % in national polls .\nThe California senator \u2019 s struggle to gain momentum reflects the unwieldy nature of this historically large Democratic field . With 24 hopefuls traipsing around the early voting states and giving back-to-back speeches at cattle calls like the recent Democratic Hall of Fame dinner in Iowa and the party convention in California , making an impression \u2013 even for the most promising contenders \u2013 is proving to be a real challenge .\nSenator Harris has also been faulted for \u201c pandering \u201d to the left and appearing overly cautious on the trail . In a field with relatively few big policy differences between them , observers say it \u2019 s vital for candidates to communicate core beliefs and a clear sense of identity . But ultimately , for many Democratic voters , it all may come down to the same bottom line : Who can beat President Donald Trump ?\n\u201c You have to have a message that resonates , \u201d says Dianne Bystrom , a longtime observer of presidential campaigns and women in politics .\n\u201c She \u2019 s got great communication skills , \u201d Dr. Bystrom says of Senator Harris , but \u201c I don \u2019 t think she \u2019 s as specific about her message as [ Massachusetts Sen. ] Elizabeth Warren is. \u201d She adds that Senator Harris needs to \u201c further define herself . \u201d\nOf course , it \u2019 s early yet , and the upcoming debates \u2013 the first of which will take place at the end of this month \u2013 could offer many second- or third-tier candidates a chance to break out of the pack . Former Vice President Joe Biden is widely regarded as a weak front-runner , and most political observers believe the landscape could shift substantially before Democratic voters start casting ballots early next year .\nJim Messina , former President Barack Obama \u2019 s campaign manager , famously commented on MSNBC in April that if Senator Harris were a stock , he \u2019 d \u201c buy her \u201d \u2013 in other words , seeing a future rise as a good bet .\nIn Iowa , the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll has Senator Harris well behind Vice President Biden , as well as behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , Senator Warren , and South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg . Yet it also found her tied with Senator Warren as the top second choice of Iowa Democrats . Heading into the caucuses , that can be a sign of hidden strength .\nStill , being voters \u2019 second choice is not the same as being their first choice .\nElijah Nouvelage/Reuters Young women react to meeting Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Sen.

She proposes a monthly tax credit of $ 500 for families earning less than $ 100,000 a year ; a big boost for teacher salaries ; and equal pay for women \u2013 with companies on the hook to prove they comply or else pay a fine .\nYet having detailed policy positions is not the same as having a message , warns Bill Carrick , a Democratic strategist in Los Angeles . \u201c The message has to be part of who you are , what you stand for , what you believe in , what your values are . \u201d\nMr. Carrick describes the revolutionary Senator Sanders as a \u201c classic stand-up-for-the-little-guy , a lefty , with policy underneath it all. \u201d Similarly , Senator Warren has the \u201c total package \u201d \u2013 someone who belongs in the hall of fame of policy wonks in her fight against corporations and who is also emotionally driven by this fight .\nFormer Vice President Biden is another strong persona , \u201c somebody who can bring us together , get things done , and most importantly , win . \u201d\nWhen asked about Senator Harris , Mr. Carrick pauses . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure what her message actually is .
