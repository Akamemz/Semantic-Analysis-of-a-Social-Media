    "content": "One of the comforts of studying history is that , no matter how bad things get , you can always find a moment in the past when things were much , much worse . Some commentators on our current crisis have been throwing around comparisons to earlier pandemics , and the Black Death of 1347 \u2014 50 inevitably gets mentioned . Please . The Black Death wiped out half the population of Europe in the space of four years . In some places the mortality was far swifter and deadlier than that . The novelist Giovanni Boccaccio , who gave us the most vivid picture of the Black Death in literature , estimated that 100,000 people died in Florence in the four months between March and July 1348 . The population of the city in 1338 , according to one contemporary chronicler , stood at 120,000 .\nBoccaccio at the time was a city tax official and saw the whole thing at ground level . Every morning bodies of the dead\u2014husbands , wives , children , servants\u2014were pushed out into the street where they were piled on stretchers , later on carts . They were carried to the nearest church for a quick blessing , then trundled to graveyards outside the city for burial . As the death toll rose , traditional burial practices were abandoned . Deep trenches were dug into which bodies were dumped in layers with a thin covering of soil shoveled on top . Boccaccio writes that \u201c no more respect was accorded the dead than would today be shown to dead goats . \u201d\nLike COVID-19 , the disease spread with bewildering rapidity , but unlike in the modern pandemic , it infected everyone , young and old , rich and poor , not mainly the old and infirm . And again unlike the current virus , the effects of bubonic plague were particularly humiliating . Tumor-like growths as big as apples , called \u201c bubos , \u201d would appear in the groin or armpit . Gangrenous blotches would appear on hands and feet causing the skin to turn black and die . The victims would start coughing up blood , all their bodily fluids stank and their breath became putrid . \u201c The stench of dead bodies , sickness and medicines seemed to fill and pollute the whole atmosphere. \u201d There was no dying with dignity during the Black Death .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise that a kind of extreme social distancing became the norm , even without urging from governments . Boccaccio \u2019 s stories are shocking . Everyone ran in panic from the sick . Neighbors shunned neighbors , relatives relatives . Children abandoned elderly parents and priests their flocks . Incredibly , \u201c even fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children , as though they did not belong to them. \u201d Some reacted by locking themselves up with a few friends in some comfortable place stocked with food and fine wines . They would entertain themselves with music and refuse to receive any news of the dead . Others , often those without the means to escape , became fatalistic and began looting the houses of the dead , stuffing themselves with food and drink , heedless of the risks of infection .\nIt is not yet certain that COVID-19 will become the fifth endemic coronavirus in the world today . The far more deadly bubonic plague long remained endemic in Europe , turning pandemic again some 17 times before its last outbreak in 1664 \u2014 67\u2014about once a generation . Over time a kind of bush telegraph developed in cities to keep track of new outbreaks . Transmitting news of the plague became a regular topic of private and public correspondence . The questions sound familiar to us now : Has the plague come to Bologna ? How long has it been there ? How many are infected ? How many have died ? Has a quarantine been imposed ? Public authorities , predictably , took drastic measures to isolate the sick .
