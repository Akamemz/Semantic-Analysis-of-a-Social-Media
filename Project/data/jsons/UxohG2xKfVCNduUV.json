    "content": "Sen. Ted Cruz plans to announce Monday that he will run for president of the United States , according to his senior advisers , accelerating his already rapid three-year rise from a tea party insurgent in Texas into a divisive political force in Washington . Cruz , scheduled to speak Monday at a convocation ceremony at Liberty University in Virginia , will not form an exploratory committee but rather launch a presidential bid outright , said advisers with direct knowledge of his plans , who spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement had not been made yet . They say he is done exploring and is now ready to become the first Republican presidential candidate .\nGentlemen ( and lady ) , start your engines . Amid the swirl of rumors , `` exploratory '' efforts , polls , Political Action Committees , staff shake-ups , and power plays , no Republican has actually officially entered the 2016 fray just yet . That ends today . The first man in -- perhaps appropriately -- is the hard-charging junior Senator from Texas , Ted Cruz . The Houston Chronicle published the scoop over the weekend : Cruz has been a lightning rod ever since his upset victory over an establishment favorite in 2012 's Senate primary in Texas . His intensity , unflinching conservatism , and aversion to compromise has delighted Tea Party and conservative activists , who form the core of Cruz 's devoted fan base . These same qualities have also won him legions of detractors , many within his own party . Cruz backers count this as a feature , not a bug -- but one typically needs well-placed allies and institutional support to mount a formidable White House bid . Cruz will no doubt run a populist campaign against a sclerotic and dysfunctional Beltway culture , placing Democrats and Republicans in his rhetorical crosshairs . Given the public 's deep-seated loathing of Washington , this strategy is likely to resonate with many voters across the political spectrum , at least on paper . To win the Republican nomination , Cruz will have to convince millions of GOP voters that he is the most viable carrier of the conservative torch against establishment juggernaut Jeb Bush . If he manages to secure the party 's backing , Cruz will then have to fend off accusations from Democrats that his hardcore views and tactics make him a prime architect of DC dysfunction , orchestrating standoffs and exploiting crises as a means of ideological warfare and self-promotion . And he 'll have to surmount these challenges while addressing his `` Obama problem , '' shared by likely 2016 entrants Marco Rubio and Rand Paul : Namely , that he 's a long-on-rhetoric , short-on-accomplishments first term Senator with little practical experience as an executive . I 'll leave you with three videos -- one previewing Cruz 's messaging to the conservative base , the others showcasing his lighter side in a recent interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers during which he navigated a trap question on climate change with a fairly deft , light touch . Even in liberal Manhattan , Cruz had a portion of the audience on his side : Cruz enters the race averaging less than five percent support among the national Republican electorate , sandwiched between Rubio and Rick Perry .",
