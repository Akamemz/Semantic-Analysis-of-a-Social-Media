''\nThe lawyers , who Trump claimed were meting out their services free of charge , each offered their own take on a legal strategy .\nNow , as President , Trump is looking for ways to best to confront the multiple investigations into Russia 's election year meddling -- and is looking , again , to his lawyers .\nIn some ways , Trump 's approach to legal representation has n't changed much in the two-and-a-half decades since he was divorcing Ivana . People who have worked with him -- then and now -- say it 's an ' I'm-right-you're-wrong ' method , honed over years of different litigation fights , that places loyalty and bull-doggedness over nearly anything else .\nFor lawyers he likes , Trump offers the world : trips to Mar-a-Lago , invites to rooftop parties , and -- if they 're successful -- handsome compensation .

His firm 's previous tasks for the President have included filing defamation suits against a biographer who allegedly understated Trump 's wealth ; legal proceedings to keep Trump 's divorce records sealed ; and intricate bond-restructuring proceedings for Trump 's casino properties in Atlantic City , New Jersey .
