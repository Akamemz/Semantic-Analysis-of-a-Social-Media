    "content": "With her victory in the primary race , Democrat Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts will become the state 's first ever black representative in Congress .\nThough she won a major upset in the race for a House seat in Massachusetts on Tuesday night , Ayanna Pressley was not endorsed by the Democratic establishment . Nor was she endorsed by members of the Congressional Black Caucus . Now , it \u2019 s not entirely unusual for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) or heavy hitters from the party to fail to endorse in a primary\u2014preferring instead to wait until the general election . But this was a particularly interesting set of circumstances .\nPressley , who doesn \u2019 t have a Republican opponent in the general election , now becomes the first black elected official to represent Massachusetts in Congress . She went up against a 10-term incumbent , a white male who was backed by both Rep. John Lewis and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick . She was running in a year where a record number of women and people of color are on the ballot for the Democrats . She was running during a midterm election when Democrats have the opportunity to shake up the status quo and remind the country that it is diversity and equality , not white supremacy , that make America great . She was also running at a time where Democrats have recently given lip-service to the fact that black women are the party \u2019 s faithful base and that black voters , as a whole , should never be taken for granted .\nGiven these things , it \u2019 s curious how Democrats have fallen so short when it comes to endorsing and investing in black women as candidates . Last month , a Broadly article noted that out of 73 candidates on the DCCC \u2019 s Red to Blue list , which contains the names of House contenders who are likely to flip seats from red to blue this year , only 3 were black women . This means that other black women running for Congress who don \u2019 t have the DCCC \u2019 s support can lose out on funding for outreach and attention from donors . In short , it puts them in an uphill battle in their races , especially when they are running in primaries against long-serving establishment incumbents .\nThough there are likely many reasons why this is happening , it \u2019 s hard to ignore the fact that Democrats have done a lousy job in recognizing the power of black voters and investing in black leadership , especially that of black women\u2014as both leaders of the Democratic National Committee and as candidates . Some of this may also be attributed to the fact that a number of these candidates represent a more progressive wing of the Democratic Party .
