( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nThe new normal : Impeachment as a routine partisan tool , endless investigations , lying under oath with impunity , surveillance of political enemies , zero accountability \u2026\nThe Left sees Donald Trump \u2019 s comportment , rallies , and tweets as a new low in presidential behavior that justifies extraordinary countermeasures . But Trump \u2019 s personal characteristics are idiosyncratic and may or may not become institutionalized by subsequent presidents . And it is not as if liberal icons such as FDR , LBJ , JFK , and Bill Clinton suddenly became saintly in office .\nWhat is far scarier is the reaction to Trump , in both the constitutional and political sense . What follows are likely the new norms for the next generation of presidents , and they will probably be equally applied to Democrats who implemented them in the Trump era .\n1 ) Private presidential phone calls with foreign leaders will be leaked and printed in the major media . The point will be not so much to air breaking news as to embarrass the president or to use such disclosures to stymie his foreign policy . Those who leak such information will be canonized as part of a \u201c resistance. \u201d Prominent officials in government will publish anonymous op-eds in the New York Times bragging about how they are daily undermining a new president \u2019 s administration .\n2 ) Impeachment is now a casual affair . It requires no report of illegal or unethical behavior by a special counsel or special prosecutor . It will not be bipartisan but solely the action of the opposition party in the House when it is in the majority .\nPublic support will not matter . Much less will it be needed . Impeachment will be applied equally to a first- or second-term presidency . And it will become useful in a reelection year to help drive down an incumbent \u2019 s popularity .\nEven when there is no chance of conviction in the Senate \u2014 as when the impeachment indictment is weak and the president \u2019 s own party controls the upper House \u2014 impeachment will nonetheless proceed , because it is now seen as a banal , politicized vote of no confidence and thus an occasionally useful political tool .\nThere will be no time limit on or shelf life of a successful impeachment . Once a president is impeached , the writ may simply sit until the House majority feels that the climate or polls are ripe to refer the articles to the Senate for trial , whether in days , weeks , months , or years . The writ \u2019 s clauses entailing supposed wrongdoing may post facto grow or shrink as news headlines and presidential popularity gyrate . Impeachment will begin not with a Judiciary Committee but with a House Intelligence Committee , whose chair will decide rules of cross-examination and witness appearances in secret in the basement of the House . Information will be selectively released to the media by the chair of the House Intelligence Committee alone to massage impeachment momentum .\n3 ) There will be no need to specify \u201c treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors \u201d in any impeachment writ against a president . \u201c Obstruction \u201d and the \u201c abuse of power \u201d will do well enough . Either can be defined largely in terms of ongoing policy differences with the opposition party . Obstructing the opposition \u2019 s effort to impeach a president and abort his agenda is now an abuse of power .\n4 ) Special counsels and special prosecutors are now irrelevant . Their appointment will be seen as patently political if not redundant . If such ossified appointees find no evidence of presidential wrongdoing , it will not matter , because their appointments were always designed foremost to embarrass and weaken a president and detract from his role as chief executive rather than find concrete evidence of wrongdoing . Whatever data they find can be used for political advantage , even if it is contradicted by the special counsels \u2019 own eventual conclusions . The key for a special prosecutor will be to draw out the investigation \u2014 in terms of time , money , and resources \u2014 and serve , in the manner of the new definition of impeachment , as a sword of Damocles over the president \u2019 s head .\n5 ) The Washington top echelon of the CIA , FBI , and NSA will be largely immune from oversight . If they wish to spy on a presidential candidate or curtail the options of a sitting president , they will easily use their powers of surveillance , leaking , and spying for political purposes \u2014 purposes mostly defined as protecting the status quo of the permanent government . Upon retirement , such intelligence heads will retain their security clearances and use this inside access to obtain lucrative analyst billets on cable news channels deemed hostile to the incumbent administration . No one will care much when an FBI or CIA director lies under oath to Congress . There will be no indictments when high intelligence officials deliberately mislead federal courts , lie to federal investigators and the public , and conspire to derail political campaigns .\n6 ) Reverse targeting of political opponents will be the normal behavior of intelligence agencies working closely with an incumbent lame-duck administration . Political rivals and opponents can be surveilled by warrants that are aimed nominally at third-party targets . The names of surveilled political opponents then can be unmasked when presidential appointees request it \u2014 the more unmaskings , and the more extraneous they are , the better .
