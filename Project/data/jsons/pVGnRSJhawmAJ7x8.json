Martin O'Malley went hard on the idea that resurrecting Glass-Steagall's firewall is central to preventing a repeat of the Great Recession \u2014 and he knocked Hillary Clinton for not sharing his enthusiasm.\n\nIt's worth pondering, because concentrating on Glass-Steagall tells a particular story about how the financial crisis happened. That story implies certain things we should do, and certain things we should learn.\n\nIn this case, the story O'Malley is telling isn't quite right.
