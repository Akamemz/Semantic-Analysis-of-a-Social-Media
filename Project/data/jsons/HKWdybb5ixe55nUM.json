    "content": "Donald Trump promised the American people he would build a \u201c big , beautiful wall \u201d along the US-Mexico border . At campaign rallies , it became a call and response . In a lot of ways , it became a joke . To some , it became a taunt at high school basketball games , a way to make clear some kinds of people aren \u2019 t welcome here . Most of all , the wall was easily the most identifiable campaign promise of any candidate in the 2016 election cycle \u2014 maybe of any candidate in a generation .\nNow that Trump is president , that promise is coming due .\nThe Trump administration now wants to see the wall built . They are absolutely serious about it . Even though it lost the first round of the funding battle in Congress , when legislators refused to give the administration billions of dollars over the summer , it \u2019 s requesting $ 1.6 billion in wall funding in the 2018 budget . And the Department of Homeland Security is reviewing proposals to build prototypes \u2014 30-foot-long segments at least 18 feet high \u2014 somewhere around San Diego .\nHow far the wall goes from symbol to reality is anyone \u2019 s guess . There are a ton of obstacles in the way : physical , legal , financial , operational . And at every step , the Trump administration will have to plot a path between the symbolic fantasy of the wall and the small , mundane , human realities of the people living on the border .\nBefore he was elected , Trump liked to say that the US practically \u201c doesn \u2019 t have a border. \u201d Unsurprisingly , he was not exactly telling the truth .\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office , there are 651.7 miles of fencing along the US-Mexico border . The first fencing was built in the 1990s , along the westernmost sector of the border ( known as the San Diego Sector ) . But the current fencing regime is largely the product of the 2006 Secure Fence Act , which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support ( backed by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer ) and which required 650 miles of fencing along certain areas of the border .\nThere \u2019 s some evidence that fencing has been effective \u2014 or , at least , that it \u2019 s been part of a broader strategy of bulking up border security that \u2019 s been effective .\nThe government estimates how many people are crossing the US-Mexico border by looking at how many are caught \u2014 and by that measure , the flow of unauthorized people into the US in 2016 was one-quarter of what it was in 2000 .\nIn the San Diego sector , in particular \u2014 where the border cuts through an urban area and it might be easy for people to slip by unnoticed \u2014 stepped-up enforcement in the 1990s led to more apprehensions at first ( as more people got caught ) , and then fewer apprehensions as people stopped trying .\nSecuring the border has historically been a policy argument , about what types of fencing are most effective , most cost-effective , and most helpful to Border Patrol agents .\nEven before Trump , there was a years-long legislative debate about whether it \u2019 s the right kind of fencing . It hasn \u2019 t been an argument about politics or symbolism . Until now .\nThe Secure Fence Act originally specified double-layer fencing , which is more expensive to build but also much harder to cut and cross through . Today , a fraction of the 650 miles of fencing count as \u201c double layer . \u201d\nLess than half of the existing fencing is thick enough to prevent pedestrians from crossing ( the rest is \u201c vehicle fencing \u201d that can \u2019 t be driven through but can be navigated on foot ) . And even \u201c pedestrian fencing \u201d isn \u2019 t always effective : The lowest apprehension rate along the entire US-Mexico border , where only an estimated 17 percent of border crossers are caught , is the sections of the El Paso sector that are \u201c completely covered \u201d by pedestrian fencing built in the past 10 years .\nWhen George W. Bush \u2019 s Department of Homeland Security said that double fencing wasn \u2019 t feasible for large swaths of the southern border , the Secure Fence Act was amended in 2007 to give the government more authority to determine what counted as a sufficient fence . To many Republicans , though , that seemed like a cop-out , and they \u2019 ve spent years accusing the government of not having finished the job right .\nRegardless of how wildly inaccurate Donald Trump was about the state of border security , a lot of people believe he \u2019 s correct \u2014 including the core supporters who made him a force to be reckoned with in the 2016 Republican presidential primary . Those voters are either unaware that there \u2019 s currently a fence or simply don \u2019 t believe a fence is enough . They want something absolutely foolproof and impregnable , or at least a symbol against attack .\nThe Trump administration is already struggling to reconcile its wild promises of a \u201c big , beautiful wall \u201d with the existing policy reality . When DHS asked for wall prototypes , it initially specified that the wall had to be concrete , which would have been extremely unlikely to fly with Border Patrol agents , who prefer something they can see through \u2014 then hastily added a separate request for non-concrete \u201c alternative \u201d materials .\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer bragged that the funding bill passed by Congress in May will allow the government to build fencing \u2014 and got into an argument with a Breitbart reporter during a press briefing when the reporter pointed out those fences weren \u2019 t a wall .\nBuilding a concrete wall \u2014 something that no one within government has asked for \u2014 would be more symbolic than practical . But simply building more fencing , and calling it a \u201c wall , \u201d would be , in a significant way , cheating .\n2 ) How realistic is it to build one continuous wall across the border ?\nAs Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( D-ND ) said during a Senate hearing on border security , \u201c There has been no one that has come before this body suggesting that we need to build a concrete wall across the border \u2014 no one . Not one person , no matter what political persuasion . \u201d\nSelling the wall in Congress will be tough , in other words . But that \u2019 s nothing compared to the practical realities of trying to actually build it .\nFor one thing , you have the Rio Grande , which defines the easternmost 1,164 miles of the border . There \u2019 s some fencing ( if only a little ) in each of the four border \u201c sectors \u201d along the Rio Grande ; much of it is set back from the river , forcing people to turn back after entering US territory instead of preventing their entry to begin with .\nIt \u2019 s not enough to prevent people from crossing \u2014 more than half of all unauthorized entries from 2013 to 2015 happened in the four easternmost Border Patrol sectors , all of which are entirely on the Rio Grande . But it makes fencing construction tricky .\n\u201c If you look out in Big Bend , \u201d says Chris Cabrera , deputy spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council , the union representing US Border Patrol agents , \u201c you have huge drop-offs , huge cliffs . It would be very difficult to build a wall over there , especially when you \u2019 re looking at about a 40- , 50-foot drop from ground level to the river . \u201d\nCabrera \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 sees border security as a three-pronged effort : infrastructure , which includes barriers to keep people from crossing ; surveillance , to inform agents when people are crossing ; and personnel , to catch people trying to cross .\nThere \u2019 s no magic ratio of the three that makes for ideal security ; given the astounding variety of terrain along the border , and the variety of uses to which humans have put its land , what \u2019 s most needed depends on where it \u2019 s going to be placed .\nThe wall , Cabrera hopes , will \u201c funnel them , or slow them down , into areas where we can apprehend them a little easier \u201d\nBarriers are most important \u201c where you have a city that \u2019 s right up against the border , \u201d explains National Border Patrol Council spokesperson Shawn Moran . Smuggling organizations tend to have \u201c infrastructure and support \u201d in urban areas \u2014 and people crossing on their own have an easy time blending into the crowd .\nCabrera says that in the Rio Grande Valley , \u201c we have areas where it \u2019 s a less than 10-second run from the river to an urban area , where it \u2019 s built up and they can hide . That \u2019 s a very difficult place to patrol because of the timing ; you have to be right on top of it when they cross . \u201d\nThis is why the San Diego area was the first part of the border to get fenced , and why fencing has been most effective there and ( to a lesser extent ) in El Paso .\nUsing fencing strategically means not putting it places where it won \u2019 t be effective \u2014 but instead pushing people toward unfenced parts of the border that are either harder to cross or easier to patrol . Agents call this \u201c funneling \u201d ; the wall , Cabrera hopes , will \u201c funnel them , or slow them down , into areas where we can apprehend them a little easier . \u201d\nAt Big Bend , for example , the same cliffs that make building a wall so daunting give agents a huge advantage on patrol . \u201c When you have a 40- , 50-foot cliff , \u201d Cabrera says , \u201c you can rest assured it \u2019 s going to be difficult to scale that thing unnoticed. \u201d When fences started going up in California , immigrants turned to the Arizona desert instead \u2014 which was harder to cross unmolested because it was simply harder to cross . It was deadlier ( hundreds of immigrants died every year ) , but it made those who survived easier to spot and catch .\nFunneling isn \u2019 t a foolproof strategy . People can still cross in fenced areas , and no one thinks you can design a perfect enough funneling system that agents will catch everyone coming through the funnel \u2019 s mouth . To people like Cabrera and Moran , the point of building a wall ( however it \u2019 s defined ) is to improve on the existing funneling , and make it as effective as possible . But to people who are looking for something rock solid and symbolic , that might not help either .\nThe easy \u2014 or at least seemingly easy \u2014 way to get around the question of when a barrier counts as a wall : define a wall as something else entirely .\nSome Republicans in Congress , like Lindsey Graham , are already doing this : saying the wall will be built but it will be a \u201c virtual wall , \u201d based on surveillance rather than physical prevention .\nThis might sound innovative . It \u2019 s not . It \u2019 s something the government has been trying to do for decades .\nBefore Republicans tried to pivot to a \u201c virtual wall , \u201d the Bush and Obama administrations tried to pivot from the Secure Fence Act to a \u201c virtual fence. \u201d Over the past two decades , there have been no fewer than four separate government initiatives to fix the border using surveillance technology \u2014 from a sensors-and-cameras initiative in 1998 to Obama-era experiments with surveillance drones .\n\u201c They couldn \u2019 t manage to do it right because they were in such a hurry \u201d\nAll four initiatives were either totally abandoned or quietly considered failures . Very expensive failures .\nThe problem is that the government has never bothered to lay out , in advance , what goals the new technology was supposed to meet \u2014 and how , exactly , it would fit in with the infrastructure and personnel in a realistic border security strategy .\nThe biggest effort \u2014 the SBInet program \u2014 was launched in 2006 to use technology to create a \u201c virtual fence. \u201d SBInet was supposed to cover 387 miles of the US border by the end of 2008 .\n\u201c They couldn \u2019 t manage to do it right , \u201d analyst Tom Barry of the TransBorder Project told Homeland Security Newswire in 2010 , \u201c because they were in such a hurry to show the American public that the government was fulfilling its responsibility to secure the border and they didn \u2019 t do the adequate preparation . \u201d\nDHS never bothered to complete a program evaluation to determine how SBInet would contribute to the broader goal of securing the border . Nor did it oversee contractors to prevent cost overruns and delays \u2014 or even , one Government Accountability Office audit found , make sure contractors had completed early steps before moving on to later ones .\nBy 2011 , when it was formally canceled , SBInet had been deployed across 53 miles \u2014 not quite 14 percent of the area it was supposed to cover . It had cost more than $ 1 billion .\nOne might hope that after the SBInet debacle , the Department of Homeland Security has learned its lesson about more careful contractor oversight . But it doesn \u2019 t appear to have learned its lesson about asking how a project fits into an actual strategy before moving forward with construction based on \u201c dreams , hopes and fantasy , \u201d as Barry described SBInet .\nIn other words , the Trump administration can \u2019 t use the \u201c virtual wall \u201d label to solve its fundamental dilemma : Should it make incremental improvements based on realistic goals , or do something symbolic and sweeping ?\nThe real answer is nobody knows exactly \u2014 mostly because there isn \u2019 t a concrete idea of what the \u201c wall \u201d will actually look like .\nWhat \u2019 s become increasingly clear is that whatever the wall is , it will be expensive .\nEstimates so far have put the price tag anywhere from a low of $ 12 billion , which was floated by the Trump administration , to $ 15 billion estimated by House and Senate Leadership to even $ 21.6 billion , the highest estimated cost in a proposal seen by the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which would be about half DHS \u2019 s yearly budget . A recent report put together by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs estimated an even higher price tag for the wall and patrolling technology , at a whopping $ 70 billion \u2014 more than four times Trump \u2019 s initial figure .\nThe Democrats \u2019 figure isn \u2019 t that unrealistic , either . At the time the Secure Fence Act was passed , Congress estimated the whole project would cost roughly $ 50 billion over the course of 25 years , which makes Trump \u2019 s estimates look especially low , given the fights he is going to have on the ground \u2014 particularly in South Texas .\nSo far , the Trump administration \u2019 s supplemental budget request to Congress , requesting $ 3 billion to begin building the wall , hire border and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents , and expand detention and deportation programs , failed to make it into the 2017 spending bill . The Democrats successfully blocked all wall funding in the government shutdown negotiations \u2014 at least until September .\nBut wall construction still isn \u2019 t at a total standstill . Funding for pending government contracts for wall prototypes is untouched \u2014 those contracts were funded through the 2016 budget . Paying for a preliminary model of the wall would likely give more clarity to how much the actual wall would cost .\nTrump has turned his eye toward the 2018 budget proposal , which has an additional $ 2.6 billion for wall construction . To be clear , this would still only be a fraction of the border wall \u2019 s estimated cost . And there is a good chance construction will run up the bill once on the ground .\nTake McAllen , Texas , a border town on the Rio Grande whose mayor , Jim Darling , has been advocating for levees instead of a wall \u2014 an ask city leaders along the more than 1,000 miles of river have made since the Secure Fence Act \u2019 s passage . The idea is that levees would help mitigate flooding and provide added security . But prioritizing these demands would be much more expensive than building a typical barrier in Yuma , Arizona , as David Aguilar , a former deputy commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection , admitted in a Senate hearing on the wall .\n\u201c You have to decide where you are going to put your resources , \u201d said David Danelo , a national security expert with the Foreign Policy Research Center who has traveled the border extensively . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be ugly . There \u2019 s going to be cost overruns when it comes to South Texas . \u201d\nThe other thing that everyone knows about Trump \u2019 s wall is that he will \u201c make Mexico pay for it. \u201d That promise seems even more unrealistic than the wall itself .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s current plan appears to say Trump never promised he \u2019 d make Mexico pay for the wall before it was built and to steam ahead , presumably figuring out how to get Mexico to pay at a later date .\nThe Mexican government certainly won \u2019 t write out an oversize charity-style check to the Trump administration for billions of dollars to pay for the wall . But there are a couple of policies the US could push to raise revenue on the backs of Mexico \u2014 or Mexicans , or Mexican Americans .\nThe most prominent idea floated on this front is the border adjustment tax . The proposal would tax Mexican imports and exempt exports ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Dylan Matthews explains this in greater detail ) , which counts as raising money because the US currently imports more than it exports . If that remained the case , the revenue raised would far outstrip the cost of the wall . The idea is well-liked by leading House Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady , who chairs the House \u2019 s tax-focused Ways and Means Committee .\nBut the border adjustment tax was not included in Trump \u2019 s one-page tax reform blueprint to Congress . And confusingly , Trump has both said he is interested in a \u201c border adjustment \u201d tax and rejected the idea of what a \u201c border adjustment \u201d tax actually is . Members of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 the conservative faction of the party that successfully moved the Republican health care plan to the right \u2014 have already expressed a lot of skepticism about the idea .\n\u201c You are adding a whole new tax and revenue stream on the economy and not getting rid of another one \u2014 that is always dangerous because it is just one more tax that could go up over time , \u201d Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) , a founding member of the Freedom Caucus , said . \u201c From a purely philosophical standpoint , I think this is problematic . \u201d\nOther solutions floated by Trump during the presidential campaign could be even more aggressive \u2014 like taxing remittances sent by people in the US to Mexico , or even confiscating them ( a move of extremely dubious legality ) .\nAll of these proposals assume that the US is in a position of strength with Mexico \u2014 that it holds all the cards and Mexico will be willing ( or forced ) to go along with whatever decision it makes . But if the Trump administration moves forward on building a wall , talking payment will be the least of its problems with Mexico \u2014 and it \u2019 s going to find the country less , not more , willing to go along with anything else America wants .\nArturo Sarukh\u00e1n , former Mexican ambassador to the US , points out that \u201c Mexico and the US ... have been working hand in hand since 9/11 \u201d to protect the border from terrorism and crime . \u201c Post-9/11 , we understood that if there was a perception that a terrorist threat had materialized across the border in Mexico , the trade relationship that we had been building since 1993 , when NAFTA was approved , would collapse . \u201d\nMuch of the border security efforts over the past 20 years \u2014 especially when it comes to the organized criminal networks that would theoretically become a bigger problem once the wall is built \u2014 has been done with the cooperation of the Mexican government . In some cases , that \u2019 s been undermined by corruption , but often the Mexican government has been successful in intercepting problems before they become the US \u2019 s problems .\nMexico , for example , has taken an active role in intercepting Central American children and families journeying to the US \u2014 \u201c at a very steep domestic and moral cost for Mexico , because this issue is criticized profoundly across Mexican society , \u201d Sarukh\u00e1n points out . Mexico shares flight manifests for all flights in Mexican airspace with the US , so that it can catch anyone on the US \u2019 s terrorism watch list . American law enforcement agents are allowed to conduct operations on Mexican soil .\nBuilding a wall would be hard to interpret as anything other than a slap in the face to everything Mexico has done for the US over the past 20 years \u2014 \u201c the meaning of this is really to separate Mexico , \u201d says Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro , who served in the government of former Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n . And it might , Sarukh\u00e1n says , cause Mexico to review \u2014 and possibly reconsider \u2014 some of its support for the US \u2019 s security needs .\n\u201c If the wall becomes an issue which contaminates the bilateral agenda as a whole , then it can start having an impact on lots of other things , \u201d says Sarukh\u00e1n . The wall isn \u2019 t supposed to impede trade flows \u2014 $ 1.4 billion in goods flow between the two countries , legally , through ports of entry \u2014 but , as Fern\u00e1ndez points out , its symbolism undermines Mexico \u2019 s decision \u201c to embrace the United States as an economic partner and to try to create a North American economic community \u201d with NAFTA .\n\u201c Over the past two decades , \u201d Sarukh\u00e1n says , the Mexican public \u201c slowly jettisoned its anti-Americanism , and its historical suspicion of the relationship with the US . You \u2019 re seeing some of that creeping back into the fabric of Mexican society . You \u2019 ve seen some significant calls to boycott US companies , US products , US brands. \u201d And the election of Trump has often been cited as a reason why the left-populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 who \u2019 s promised to take a more antagonistic stance toward the US \u2014 is leading in presidential polls .\n6 ) But what about the private property along the US-Mexico border ?\nSay Trump gets the money , and he somehow figures out a way to build a wall through rivers , canyons , and jungles . He still will have a big problem on his hands : American landowners .\nTo build the wall , federal officials will have to take a sizable chunk of private land on the southern border away from American citizens , many of whom have owned rights to the land for centuries . Make no mistake , this process would be incredibly time-consuming and expensive for the federal government , and a point of contention with American voters .\n\u201c This is a battle , \u201d Rep. Henry Cuellar ( D-TX ) , whose district covers 280 miles of the border , told the Los Angeles Times . \u201c In Texas , we have a long tradition of private property rights . Any time big government starts using eminent domain and taking land \u2014 especially the valuable part , access to water \u2014 then it becomes a battle cry . Lawsuits will definitely be coming in . \u201d\nTake Mauricio Vidaurri , one of Cuellar \u2019 s constituents , whose family has owned 1,300 acres of land just 20 miles south of Laredo , Texas , since 1750 . Vidaurri is a rancher and an inspector with Customs and Border Protection , and his land extends to the river , where Trump \u2019 s wall would be built .\nHe has some practical concerns ; he relies on the water from the river to grow hay on his ranch . Would the wall cut him off from his water source ?\nThen there \u2019 s sentiment . The wall could cut off his family \u2019 s nearly 200-year-old cemetery , where his great-grandfather , grandfather , and father , a World War II veteran , are buried . Vidaurri \u2019 s situation poses what will likely be one of the biggest challenges for the Trump administration on the road ahead .\nThe federal government has the legal power to take private land through eminent domain , if it compensates the landowners for the property . But landowners also have the right to due process , which in the past has tied up the government in courts for years .\nThis has happened before . After the Secure Fence Act \u2019 s passage , officials began the long process of buying off people \u2019 s lands , and hundreds of landowners fought back . There are still more than 90 cases tied up in court a decade later , according to Terence Garrett , a border security expert with the University of Texas Rio Grande . So far , the government has spent nearly $ 80 million to compensate landowners to build the existing fencing . The Chicago Tribune reported that Customs and Border Protection \u201c estimates that it will spend an additional $ 21 million in real estate expenses associated with the remaining condemnation cases , not including about $ 4 million in Justice Department litigation costs . \u201d\nGarrett was personally involved in one of these fights in 2007 , when the University of Texas Rio Grande successfully stopped the federal government from building an 18-foot border fence through campus . Instead , it built a 10-foot fence separating campus from a next-door golf course . Another golf course nearby was able to stop building altogether , Garrett said , adding that working-class neighborhoods were notably less successful in winning eminent domain cases . Some offered sentimental and emotional appeals \u2014 like the university \u2019 s case that the wall would disrupt the bicultural , binational standing of the university . Others have said it would be bad for business .\nPut simply , government taking American citizens \u2019 private land is not a popular idea \u2014 especially in Texas , where most of these battles will go down . Garrett predicts private landowners will be even more driven to fight against Trump \u2019 s wall .\n\u201c The difference between this time and last time is that people know what happened last time , \u201d he said .\nIn California and Arizona , the government already has the rights to most of the border land . But Arizona is also home to the sovereign territory of the Tohono O \u2019 odham Nation reservation , which has already come out against building the wall . If the government attempts to build the wall through the 75 miles of sovereign territory in Arizona , it won \u2019 t be anything short of a fight .\n\u201c You would fundamentally have to change treaty arrangements with them , \u201d said Roger McManus , who is on the board of directors of the Friends of the Sonoran Desert National Monument , a nonprofit that works with federal agencies to protect the natural and cultural resources in Arizona and California . \u201c You would see something that would surpass the [ Dakota Access ] pipeline situation . \u201d\nThen there are the environmental concerns . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Eliza Barclay and Sarah Frostenson reported , \u201c the 654 miles of walls and fences already on the US-Mexico border have made a mess out of the environment there . \u201d\nWith fencing , Border Patrol has made some accommodations for migrating animals in the area \u2014 but depending on what this wall would look like , that might no longer be a workaround .\nSomehow , as \u201c Build the wall ! \u201d became a way to taunt liberal college students and Latino basketball players , the idea of the wall as an actual policy got lost . Would the wall actually stop people from coming over the border without papers ?\n\u201c We can \u2019 t fool ourselves , \u201d says former CBP Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar . \u201c Is there something that is going to guarantee 100 percent that we \u2019 re going to seal the border ? No , absolutely not . \u201d\nIt will never be impossible for someone who wants to enter the US to do so if they have the time , resources , and determination . The purpose of border security is to set that bar as high as possible \u2014 which means some people will be more easily deterred than others .\nSome will simply go under , over , or even through the wall . The best advantage a wall has over a fence is that it \u2019 s harder to cut through ; the Trump administration \u2019 s contract request requires wall prototypes to be able to resist 30 to 90 minutes of drilling with hand tools . But the parts of the border where fencing is most effective ( the San Diego area ) are also the ones where the government has discovered the most , and most sophisticated , tunnels .\nIn 2012 , DHS reported that it had discovered 140 tunnels over the past two decades \u2014 increasing from about five or six per year before 2008 to nearly 10 per year afterward . Many of those tunnels were described as \u201c sophisticated \u201d systems with interlocking passageways and sometimes even lighting and flooring .\nThe San Diego fence didn \u2019 t necessarily cause smugglers to build tunnels instead , but it certainly wasn \u2019 t enough to prevent their construction . Furthermore , the very reason fencing is considered so helpful in San Diego \u2014 its urban density \u2014 made it easy for smugglers to build tunnels without detection : \u201c The buildings on both sides of the border allow for the concealment of tunnel entry and exit points . \u201d\nMeanwhile , there \u2019 s the threat of drug smuggling drones being piloted across the border . Less futuristic , but more common , is the use of ultralight aircraft to smuggle drug loads over the heads of Border Patrol agents ( a trend that \u2019 s been simmering for several years ) . And even if a wall could stretch from sea to shining sea , committed smugglers and immigrants could get into boats or submarines .\nThe wall is more likely to block some kinds of illegal entries than others\nOr smugglers could just continue to do what many of them are doing anyway : cross the border \u201c the right way \u201d \u2014 at a port of entry \u2014 with contraband in tow .\nCustoms and Border Protection doesn \u2019 t make an effort to estimate how many drugs successfully enter the US \u2014 a spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c We can \u2019 t track what we don \u2019 t catch. \u201d But no one believes that agents are catching all the drugs ( or people ) that smugglers bring into the country through ports of entry , in specially outfitted trucks or thanks to bribing patrol agents . The Drug Enforcement Administration \u2019 s 2016 drug threat report says that Mexican drug smuggling organizations , in particular , prefer to send their product into the US through ports \u2014 and that hard drugs are particularly likely to be flown into the US , smuggled in on commercial flights .\nThis doesn \u2019 t mean that a wall does nothing . It means the wall is more likely to block some kinds of illegal entries than others . Individuals trying to come to the United States for work or family might successfully be deterred from crossing ; cartels aiming to make millions of dollars in cocaine revenue probably will not .\nIf Border Patrol agents are being freed up to track down and investigate these \u201c sophisticated \u201d criminal enterprises , because they no longer have to round up small groups of immigrants straggling through the desert , that could be one way to define success .\nChris Cabrera of the National Border Patrol Council says this is a strategy smugglers use now to distract border agents : \u201c They know that Border Patrol agents are going to have to come in and apprehend these folks , sometimes 80 to 90 at a time , which is gon na deplete our lines , deplete our resources in the field . And once we pull out of other areas , they can bring across drugs or more high-value human cargo. \u201d A wall would have something like the opposite effect : reducing the distractions of \u201c low-value \u201d immigrant targets and freeing up agents to catch higher-level criminal activity .\nThere is some evidence that previous border security buildups have succeeded in deterring such \u201c low-value \u201d targets from coming to the US over the past decade ( though some scholars argue that the Great Recession played a bigger role ) . There \u2019 s even more evidence that it \u2019 s deterred people who were caught once from trying to cross a second time . But it \u2019 s not clear whether that \u2019 s an indication that the US could be even more effective with even more enforcement , or that the government has already picked the low-hanging fruit .\nAll things considered , there simply aren \u2019 t a lot of \u201c low-value \u201d immigrant targets still coming across the border . Certainly not compared with how many there were in 2000 , or even in 2012 . The people still coming to the US without papers are , increasingly , children and families from Central America trying to seek asylum \u2014 something that , legally speaking , they \u2019 re supposed to be able to do by presenting themselves at ports of entry . If the wall is built , they \u2019 re supposed to be able to meet someone at the door .\nThe most unrealistic expectation one could have of the wall is that it could reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the US . Most of the immigrants who are here have been in the US for more than a decade . If anything , the border security buildup back in the 1990s encouraged them to settle in the US and send for family members .\nBuilding a wall now wouldn \u2019 t have the same sort of unintended consequences \u2014 for the simple reason that it \u2019 s already happened . People have already settled . The existing barriers have already changed the border from a place where people can cross back and forth to one that people , at risk of their lives , hope to have to try to cross only once .\nWhether you see further enforcement as a worthwhile endeavor depends pretty strongly on whether you see deterring unauthorized migration , in any form \u2014 and to any extent \u2014 as an important and good thing . If you think of unauthorized immigrants as collateral damage in a war on crime \u2014 and see human smuggling , for example , as the inevitable impact of making it harder to get to the US \u2014 the effect of a wall on criminal organizations won \u2019 t be enough to justify the effect on immigrants \u2019 lives .\nBut if you think of unauthorized immigration as something that strengthens criminal activity \u2014 either because you think \u201c illegal immigrants \u201d are themselves inherently criminal or because you think the demand for human smuggling is driving the supply of smugglers \u2014 disrupting immigrants for the sake of hypothetically , slightly , temporarily disrupting criminal organizations is a win-win .\nThe question then is whether the effect it \u2019 s likely to have on disrupting unauthorized migration will be worth the money ( and everything else ) it costs to build it .\n8 ) Why is it so important for Trump to build the wall ?\nThe wall is Trump \u2019 s most identifiable campaign promise . Of course , not all of his voters thought he would literally build a wall to keep that promise \u2014 some didn \u2019 t even want him to . Polls both before and after the election show that a border wall isn \u2019 t a terribly popular idea , even among some Republicans .\nOne poll conducted by the Pew Research Center , in particular , shows that Republicans living within 350 miles of the US-Mexico border \u2014 the people closest to the putative wall \u2014 were the least likely to support it .\nBut this isn \u2019 t about Trump \u2019 s voters . It \u2019 s about his base .\nResearch indicates that many Americans \u2014 particularly white Americans , and particularly a strain of white conservative Americans especially concerned about immigration \u2014 are worried about immigration less as a legal issue than as a cultural threat , especially when it comes to Latino immigrants ( whom they associate with a different way of life and also , often , with crime ) . Furthermore , those Americans tend to conflate \u201c illegal immigrants \u201d with \u201c immigrants \u201d and \u201c immigrants \u201d with \u201c Latinos \u201d \u2014 leading them to overstate the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country , and imagine more pouring in .\n\u201c The average person , particularly if they don \u2019 t live anywhere near the US-Mexico border , is probably not going to be able to make a judgment on how threatening the border is based on their own personal experience . What they tend to do is rely on statements made by sources of political information , \u201d says Christopher Federico of the University of Minnesota . Trump told them the border was lawless . Furthermore , he emphasized \u201c in-group/out-group \u201d distinctions like native-born Americans versus immigrants \u2014 and \u201c with that usually comes a consciousness of threat . \u201d\nPresident Trump stirred up that threat . He may be able to calm it back down .\nIn a study published in 2016 , researchers asked subjects how much of a threat they felt from Mexican immigration \u2014 and then had one group of subjects read an article that emphasized the security that already existed on the US-Mexico border , while another group read one emphasizing the border \u2019 s permeability .\nSubjects who already felt threatened by Mexican migration and read about the weakness of the border were more likely to overestimate how close Mexico City was to the United States , and to overestimate the number of Mexican immigrants currently living in the US . But people who had felt threatened by Mexican immigration and then read about how strong the border was were likely to feel that Mexico City was further away from the US \u2014 and that the Mexican immigrant population was smaller \u2014 than it actually was .\nYou could conclude that the wall will help people threatened by immigration feel safer . Or you could conclude that how safe people feel the border is depends on whether they \u2019 re told the border is safe or not .\nIf Trump wanted to declare victory on border security \u2014 with or without a wall \u2014 he might be able to persuade many of his supporters that immigration from the south was no longer a threat .\n\u201c Trump might say , \u2018 Okay , we have built a wall , we have fixed this problem , it \u2019 s getting better , \u2019 \u201d Federico says . \u201c If he very consistently sends a signal like that , and he \u2019 s backed by other people in his party in saying the same thing , then I think you would expect to find that among Donald Trump supporters \u2014 and the public and Republicans more generally \u2014 they might think , \u2018 Okay , the problem \u2019 s getting better . We don \u2019 t have to worry about this to the same extent that we used to . \u2019 \u201d\nHe might not even need to build the wall first . The simple fact of having a Republican in office , Federico conjectures , might allow Republicans to worry a little less about border security \u2014 in the same way that partisans assume the economy is better when the president is a member of their party . But if Trump actively sent that message , it would be much more effective .\nAlready the Trump administration is trumpeting a drop in border apprehensions as a victory for the president \u2019 s agenda \u2014 before a single brick ( or transparent-but-still-impenetrable brick equivalent ) has been laid .\nBut not every conservative is going along . Breitbart is pushing Trump officials on building a wall ; Rush Limbaugh has already hinted he thinks the administration is caving on it . If that happens , Trump \u2019 s base won \u2019 t be getting a unified signal that the threat is over . What Trump thinks counts as a \u201c wall \u201d might , ultimately , be less important than what the Breitbart editorial board thinks .\nThe people who know better than anyone the costs we might pay for a wall are the people who live on the border .\n\u201c Those of us ( who ) have lived along the border have long understood that dealing with Washington \u2019 s berrinches ( tantrums ) is just part of the deal , \u201d former Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza told Alfredo Corchado in an article published in Americas Quarterly earlier this year .\nThey \u2019 ve known from the beginning that the border has been anything but nonexistent . They \u2019 ve lived through its industrialization ( or , as some might put it , militarization ) \u2014 the fences , the expansion of Border Patrol , the surveillance .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve lived on the border for almost 30 years now , \u201d says Vicki Gaubeca , director of the Center for Border Rights at the ACLU of New Mexico . \u201c It used to be a much more fluid border , where people would cross more easily and have family on both sides . And now it just seems that we \u2019 re more separated from each other . \u201d\nBut as disrupted as the lives of border residents already are , building a wall \u2014 or even starting to build a wall \u2014 would be something else . It would be permanent and destructive and implacable .\nAlready the fear of a wall is reverberating through the economies of border communities . \u201c Individuals are coming less and less to come shop at better stores on the US side , \u201d Gaubeca says . Developers in Brownsville , Texas , blamed the collapse of a planned multimillion-dollar development in the town on the fence that the government was building along the border in the Rio Grande Valley .\nThe border is a region , and the people who are living there don \u2019 t particularly want to be walled off from each other . Even Republican voters who live within 350 miles of the border \u2014 the people whom the president supposedly wants to protect \u2014 are much more ambivalent about it than those farther away .\n\u201c A lot of border communities think , \u2018 Net migration is zero ; there are already so many resources that we have \u2019 \u201d for border security , Gaubeca says . \u201c What problem are we trying to solve ? \u201d\nThe benefits of building a wall across the border are questionable at best \u2014 it \u2019 s not clear whether doing more will be more effective than what already exists , or if the government is paying enough attention to make it more effective .\nBut the benefits won \u2019 t show up until the end of what promises to be a very long and slow process . It \u2019 s entirely possible that the effort will be started and then abandoned \u2014 or that the administration will abruptly shift to a \u201c virtual wall \u201d in an effort to claim an easier win .\nThat might prevent some of the fallout from a wall \u2014 the environmental danger , the money spent in court cases . It won \u2019 t work to reknit sundered halves of communities . The disruption of the border , as a region , is ongoing . Even considering a wall has symbolic power there . And every incremental step to turn the wall from symbol into reality works a little harder .",
    "content_original": "Donald Trump promised the American people he would build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d along the US-Mexico border. At campaign rallies, it became a call and response. In a lot of ways, it became a joke. To some, it became a taunt at high school basketball games, a way to make clear some kinds of people aren\u2019t welcome here. Most of all, the wall was easily the most identifiable campaign promise of any candidate in the 2016 election cycle \u2014 maybe of any candidate in a generation.\n\nNow that Trump is president, that promise is coming due.\n\nThe Trump administration now wants to see the wall built. They are absolutely serious about it. Even though it lost the first round of the funding battle in Congress, when legislators refused to give the administration billions of dollars over the summer, it\u2019s requesting $1.6 billion in wall funding in the 2018 budget. And the Department of Homeland Security is reviewing proposals to build prototypes \u2014 30-foot-long segments at least 18 feet high \u2014 somewhere around San Diego.\n\nHow far the wall goes from symbol to reality is anyone\u2019s guess. There are a ton of obstacles in the way: physical, legal, financial, operational. And at every step, the Trump administration will have to plot a path between the symbolic fantasy of the wall and the small, mundane, human realities of the people living on the border.\n\n1) Why do we need a wall?\n\nBefore he was elected, Trump liked to say that the US practically \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a border.\u201d Unsurprisingly, he was not exactly telling the truth.\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, there are 651.7 miles of fencing along the US-Mexico border. The first fencing was built in the 1990s, along the westernmost sector of the border (known as the San Diego Sector). But the current fencing regime is largely the product of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (backed by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer) and which required 650 miles of fencing along certain areas of the border.\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that fencing has been effective \u2014 or, at least, that it\u2019s been part of a broader strategy of bulking up border security that\u2019s been effective.\n\nThe government estimates how many people are crossing the US-Mexico border by looking at how many are caught \u2014 and by that measure, the flow of unauthorized people into the US in 2016 was one-quarter of what it was in 2000.\n\nIn the San Diego sector, in particular \u2014 where the border cuts through an urban area and it might be easy for people to slip by unnoticed \u2014 stepped-up enforcement in the 1990s led to more apprehensions at first (as more people got caught), and then fewer apprehensions as people stopped trying.\n\nThe question is whether it\u2019s enough.\n\nSecuring the border has historically been a policy argument, about what types of fencing are most effective, most cost-effective, and most helpful to Border Patrol agents.\n\nEven before Trump, there was a years-long legislative debate about whether it\u2019s the right kind of fencing. It hasn\u2019t been an argument about politics or symbolism. Until now.\n\nThe Secure Fence Act originally specified double-layer fencing, which is more expensive to build but also much harder to cut and cross through. Today, a fraction of the 650 miles of fencing count as \u201cdouble layer.\u201d\n\nLess than half of the existing fencing is thick enough to prevent pedestrians from crossing (the rest is \u201cvehicle fencing\u201d that can\u2019t be driven through but can be navigated on foot). And even \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d isn\u2019t always effective: The lowest apprehension rate along the entire US-Mexico border, where only an estimated 17 percent of border crossers are caught, is the sections of the El Paso sector that are \u201ccompletely covered\u201d by pedestrian fencing built in the past 10 years.\n\nWhen George W. Bush\u2019s Department of Homeland Security said that double fencing wasn\u2019t feasible for large swaths of the southern border, the Secure Fence Act was amended in 2007 to give the government more authority to determine what counted as a sufficient fence. To many Republicans, though, that seemed like a cop-out, and they\u2019ve spent years accusing the government of not having finished the job right.\n\nRegardless of how wildly inaccurate Donald Trump was about the state of border security, a lot of people believe he\u2019s correct \u2014 including the core supporters who made him a force to be reckoned with in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. Those voters are either unaware that there\u2019s currently a fence or simply don\u2019t believe a fence is enough. They want something absolutely foolproof and impregnable, or at least a symbol against attack.\n\nThe Trump administration is already struggling to reconcile its wild promises of a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d with the existing policy reality. When DHS asked for wall prototypes, it initially specified that the wall had to be concrete, which would have been extremely unlikely to fly with Border Patrol agents, who prefer something they can see through \u2014 then hastily added a separate request for non-concrete \u201calternative\u201d materials.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer bragged that the funding bill passed by Congress in May will allow the government to build fencing \u2014 and got into an argument with a Breitbart reporter during a press briefing when the reporter pointed out those fences weren\u2019t a wall.\n\nBuilding a concrete wall \u2014 something that no one within government has asked for \u2014 would be more symbolic than practical. But simply building more fencing, and calling it a \u201cwall,\u201d would be, in a significant way, cheating.\n\n2) How realistic is it to build one continuous wall across the border?\n\nNot even a little bit.\n\nAs Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) said during a Senate hearing on border security, \u201cThere has been no one that has come before this body suggesting that we need to build a concrete wall across the border \u2014 no one. Not one person, no matter what political persuasion.\u201d\n\nSelling the wall in Congress will be tough, in other words. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the practical realities of trying to actually build it.\n\nFor one thing, you have the Rio Grande, which defines the easternmost 1,164 miles of the border. There\u2019s some fencing (if only a little) in each of the four border \u201csectors\u201d along the Rio Grande; much of it is set back from the river, forcing people to turn back after entering US territory instead of preventing their entry to begin with.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to prevent people from crossing \u2014 more than half of all unauthorized entries from 2013 to 2015 happened in the four easternmost Border Patrol sectors, all of which are entirely on the Rio Grande. But it makes fencing construction tricky.\n\nBut the real problem is the canyons.\n\n\u201cIf you look out in Big Bend,\u201d says Chris Cabrera, deputy spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing US Border Patrol agents, \u201cyou have huge drop-offs, huge cliffs. It would be very difficult to build a wall over there, especially when you\u2019re looking at about a 40-, 50-foot drop from ground level to the river.\u201d\n\nCabrera \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 sees border security as a three-pronged effort: infrastructure, which includes barriers to keep people from crossing; surveillance, to inform agents when people are crossing; and personnel, to catch people trying to cross.\n\nThere\u2019s no magic ratio of the three that makes for ideal security; given the astounding variety of terrain along the border, and the variety of uses to which humans have put its land, what\u2019s most needed depends on where it\u2019s going to be placed.\n\nThe wall, Cabrera hopes, will \u201cfunnel them, or slow them down, into areas where we can apprehend them a little easier\u201d\n\nBarriers are most important \u201cwhere you have a city that\u2019s right up against the border,\u201d explains National Border Patrol Council spokesperson Shawn Moran. Smuggling organizations tend to have \u201cinfrastructure and support\u201d in urban areas \u2014 and people crossing on their own have an easy time blending into the crowd.\n\nCabrera says that in the Rio Grande Valley, \u201cwe have areas where it\u2019s a less than 10-second run from the river to an urban area, where it\u2019s built up and they can hide. That\u2019s a very difficult place to patrol because of the timing; you have to be right on top of it when they cross.\u201d\n\nThis is why the San Diego area was the first part of the border to get fenced, and why fencing has been most effective there and (to a lesser extent) in El Paso.\n\nUsing fencing strategically means not putting it places where it won\u2019t be effective \u2014 but instead pushing people toward unfenced parts of the border that are either harder to cross or easier to patrol. Agents call this \u201cfunneling\u201d; the wall, Cabrera hopes, will \u201cfunnel them, or slow them down, into areas where we can apprehend them a little easier.\u201d\n\nAt Big Bend, for example, the same cliffs that make building a wall so daunting give agents a huge advantage on patrol. \u201cWhen you have a 40-, 50-foot cliff,\u201d Cabrera says, \u201cyou can rest assured it\u2019s going to be difficult to scale that thing unnoticed.\u201d When fences started going up in California, immigrants turned to the Arizona desert instead \u2014 which was harder to cross unmolested because it was simply harder to cross. It was deadlier (hundreds of immigrants died every year), but it made those who survived easier to spot and catch.\n\nFunneling isn\u2019t a foolproof strategy. People can still cross in fenced areas, and no one thinks you can design a perfect enough funneling system that agents will catch everyone coming through the funnel\u2019s mouth. To people like Cabrera and Moran, the point of building a wall (however it\u2019s defined) is to improve on the existing funneling, and make it as effective as possible. But to people who are looking for something rock solid and symbolic, that might not help either.\n\n3) What about a virtual wall?\n\nThe easy \u2014 or at least seemingly easy \u2014 way to get around the question of when a barrier counts as a wall: define a wall as something else entirely.\n\nSome Republicans in Congress, like Lindsey Graham, are already doing this: saying the wall will be built but it will be a \u201cvirtual wall,\u201d based on surveillance rather than physical prevention.\n\nThis might sound innovative. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s something the government has been trying to do for decades.\n\nBefore Republicans tried to pivot to a \u201cvirtual wall,\u201d the Bush and Obama administrations tried to pivot from the Secure Fence Act to a \u201cvirtual fence.\u201d Over the past two decades, there have been no fewer than four separate government initiatives to fix the border using surveillance technology \u2014 from a sensors-and-cameras initiative in 1998 to Obama-era experiments with surveillance drones.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t manage to do it right because they were in such a hurry\u201d\n\nAll four initiatives were either totally abandoned or quietly considered failures. Very expensive failures.\n\nThe problem is that the government has never bothered to lay out, in advance, what goals the new technology was supposed to meet \u2014 and how, exactly, it would fit in with the infrastructure and personnel in a realistic border security strategy.\n\nThe biggest effort \u2014 the SBInet program \u2014 was launched in 2006 to use technology to create a \u201cvirtual fence.\u201d SBInet was supposed to cover 387 miles of the US border by the end of 2008.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t manage to do it right,\u201d analyst Tom Barry of the TransBorder Project told Homeland Security Newswire in 2010, \u201cbecause they were in such a hurry to show the American public that the government was fulfilling its responsibility to secure the border and they didn\u2019t do the adequate preparation.\u201d\n\nDHS never bothered to complete a program evaluation to determine how SBInet would contribute to the broader goal of securing the border. Nor did it oversee contractors to prevent cost overruns and delays \u2014 or even, one Government Accountability Office audit found, make sure contractors had completed early steps before moving on to later ones.\n\nBy 2011, when it was formally canceled, SBInet had been deployed across 53 miles \u2014 not quite 14 percent of the area it was supposed to cover. It had cost more than $1 billion.\n\nOne might hope that after the SBInet debacle, the Department of Homeland Security has learned its lesson about more careful contractor oversight. But it doesn\u2019t appear to have learned its lesson about asking how a project fits into an actual strategy before moving forward with construction based on \u201cdreams, hopes and fantasy,\u201d as Barry described SBInet.\n\nIn other words, the Trump administration can\u2019t use the \u201cvirtual wall\u201d label to solve its fundamental dilemma: Should it make incremental improvements based on realistic goals, or do something symbolic and sweeping?\n\n4) How much will the wall cost?\n\nThe real answer is nobody knows exactly \u2014 mostly because there isn\u2019t a concrete idea of what the \u201cwall\u201d will actually look like.\n\nWhat\u2019s become increasingly clear is that whatever the wall is, it will be expensive.\n\nEstimates so far have put the price tag anywhere from a low of $12 billion, which was floated by the Trump administration, to $15 billion estimated by House and Senate Leadership to even $21.6 billion, the highest estimated cost in a proposal seen by the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which would be about half DHS\u2019s yearly budget. A recent report put together by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs estimated an even higher price tag for the wall and patrolling technology, at a whopping $70 billion \u2014 more than four times Trump\u2019s initial figure.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 figure isn\u2019t that unrealistic, either. At the time the Secure Fence Act was passed, Congress estimated the whole project would cost roughly $50 billion over the course of 25 years, which makes Trump\u2019s estimates look especially low, given the fights he is going to have on the ground \u2014 particularly in South Texas.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration\u2019s supplemental budget request to Congress, requesting $3 billion to begin building the wall, hire border and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and expand detention and deportation programs, failed to make it into the 2017 spending bill. The Democrats successfully blocked all wall funding in the government shutdown negotiations \u2014 at least until September.\n\nBut wall construction still isn\u2019t at a total standstill. Funding for pending government contracts for wall prototypes is untouched \u2014 those contracts were funded through the 2016 budget. Paying for a preliminary model of the wall would likely give more clarity to how much the actual wall would cost.\n\nTrump has turned his eye toward the 2018 budget proposal, which has an additional $2.6 billion for wall construction. To be clear, this would still only be a fraction of the border wall\u2019s estimated cost. And there is a good chance construction will run up the bill once on the ground.\n\nTake McAllen, Texas, a border town on the Rio Grande whose mayor, Jim Darling, has been advocating for levees instead of a wall \u2014 an ask city leaders along the more than 1,000 miles of river have made since the Secure Fence Act\u2019s passage. The idea is that levees would help mitigate flooding and provide added security. But prioritizing these demands would be much more expensive than building a typical barrier in Yuma, Arizona, as David Aguilar, a former deputy commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, admitted in a Senate hearing on the wall.\n\n\u201cYou have to decide where you are going to put your resources,\u201d said David Danelo, a national security expert with the Foreign Policy Research Center who has traveled the border extensively. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be ugly. There\u2019s going to be cost overruns when it comes to South Texas.\u201d\n\n5) Will Mexico \u201cpay for\u201d the wall?\n\nThe other thing that everyone knows about Trump\u2019s wall is that he will \u201cmake Mexico pay for it.\u201d That promise seems even more unrealistic than the wall itself.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s current plan appears to say Trump never promised he\u2019d make Mexico pay for the wall before it was built and to steam ahead, presumably figuring out how to get Mexico to pay at a later date.\n\nThe Mexican government certainly won\u2019t write out an oversize charity-style check to the Trump administration for billions of dollars to pay for the wall. But there are a couple of policies the US could push to raise revenue on the backs of Mexico \u2014 or Mexicans, or Mexican Americans.\n\nThe most prominent idea floated on this front is the border adjustment tax. The proposal would tax Mexican imports and exempt exports (Vox\u2019s Dylan Matthews explains this in greater detail), which counts as raising money because the US currently imports more than it exports. If that remained the case, the revenue raised would far outstrip the cost of the wall. The idea is well-liked by leading House Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Kevin Brady, who chairs the House\u2019s tax-focused Ways and Means Committee.\n\nBut the border adjustment tax was not included in Trump\u2019s one-page tax reform blueprint to Congress. And confusingly, Trump has both said he is interested in a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax and rejected the idea of what a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax actually is. Members of the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 the conservative faction of the party that successfully moved the Republican health care plan to the right \u2014 have already expressed a lot of skepticism about the idea.\n\n\u201cYou are adding a whole new tax and revenue stream on the economy and not getting rid of another one \u2014 that is always dangerous because it is just one more tax that could go up over time,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, said. \u201cFrom a purely philosophical standpoint, I think this is problematic.\u201d\n\nOther solutions floated by Trump during the presidential campaign could be even more aggressive \u2014 like taxing remittances sent by people in the US to Mexico, or even confiscating them (a move of extremely dubious legality).\n\nAll of these proposals assume that the US is in a position of strength with Mexico \u2014 that it holds all the cards and Mexico will be willing (or forced) to go along with whatever decision it makes. But if the Trump administration moves forward on building a wall, talking payment will be the least of its problems with Mexico \u2014 and it\u2019s going to find the country less, not more, willing to go along with anything else America wants.\n\nArturo Sarukh\u00e1n, former Mexican ambassador to the US, points out that \u201cMexico and the US ... have been working hand in hand since 9/11\u201d to protect the border from terrorism and crime. \u201cPost-9/11, we understood that if there was a perception that a terrorist threat had materialized across the border in Mexico, the trade relationship that we had been building since 1993, when NAFTA was approved, would collapse.\u201d\n\nMuch of the border security efforts over the past 20 years \u2014 especially when it comes to the organized criminal networks that would theoretically become a bigger problem once the wall is built \u2014 has been done with the cooperation of the Mexican government. In some cases, that\u2019s been undermined by corruption, but often the Mexican government has been successful in intercepting problems before they become the US\u2019s problems.\n\nMexico, for example, has taken an active role in intercepting Central American children and families journeying to the US \u2014 \u201cat a very steep domestic and moral cost for Mexico, because this issue is criticized profoundly across Mexican society,\u201d Sarukh\u00e1n points out. Mexico shares flight manifests for all flights in Mexican airspace with the US, so that it can catch anyone on the US\u2019s terrorism watch list. American law enforcement agents are allowed to conduct operations on Mexican soil.\n\nBuilding a wall would be hard to interpret as anything other than a slap in the face to everything Mexico has done for the US over the past 20 years \u2014 \u201cthe meaning of this is really to separate Mexico,\u201d says Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro, who served in the government of former Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n. And it might, Sarukh\u00e1n says, cause Mexico to review \u2014 and possibly reconsider \u2014 some of its support for the US\u2019s security needs.\n\n\u201cIf the wall becomes an issue which contaminates the bilateral agenda as a whole, then it can start having an impact on lots of other things,\u201d says Sarukh\u00e1n. The wall isn\u2019t supposed to impede trade flows \u2014 $1.4 billion in goods flow between the two countries, legally, through ports of entry \u2014 but, as Fern\u00e1ndez points out, its symbolism undermines Mexico\u2019s decision \u201cto embrace the United States as an economic partner and to try to create a North American economic community\u201d with NAFTA.\n\n\u201cOver the past two decades,\u201d Sarukh\u00e1n says, the Mexican public \u201cslowly jettisoned its anti-Americanism, and its historical suspicion of the relationship with the US. You\u2019re seeing some of that creeping back into the fabric of Mexican society. You\u2019ve seen some significant calls to boycott US companies, US products, US brands.\u201d And the election of Trump has often been cited as a reason why the left-populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2014 who\u2019s promised to take a more antagonistic stance toward the US \u2014 is leading in presidential polls.\n\n6) But what about the private property along the US-Mexico border?\n\nSay Trump gets the money, and he somehow figures out a way to build a wall through rivers, canyons, and jungles. He still will have a big problem on his hands: American landowners.\n\nTo build the wall, federal officials will have to take a sizable chunk of private land on the southern border away from American citizens, many of whom have owned rights to the land for centuries. Make no mistake, this process would be incredibly time-consuming and expensive for the federal government, and a point of contention with American voters.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle,\u201d Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), whose district covers 280 miles of the border, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIn Texas, we have a long tradition of private property rights. Any time big government starts using eminent domain and taking land \u2014 especially the valuable part, access to water \u2014 then it becomes a battle cry. Lawsuits will definitely be coming in.\u201d\n\nTake Mauricio Vidaurri, one of Cuellar\u2019s constituents, whose family has owned 1,300 acres of land just 20 miles south of Laredo, Texas, since 1750. Vidaurri is a rancher and an inspector with Customs and Border Protection, and his land extends to the river, where Trump\u2019s wall would be built.\n\nHe has some practical concerns; he relies on the water from the river to grow hay on his ranch. Would the wall cut him off from his water source?\n\nThen there\u2019s sentiment. The wall could cut off his family\u2019s nearly 200-year-old cemetery, where his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father, a World War II veteran, are buried. Vidaurri\u2019s situation poses what will likely be one of the biggest challenges for the Trump administration on the road ahead.\n\nThe federal government has the legal power to take private land through eminent domain, if it compensates the landowners for the property. But landowners also have the right to due process, which in the past has tied up the government in courts for years.\n\nThis has happened before. After the Secure Fence Act\u2019s passage, officials began the long process of buying off people\u2019s lands, and hundreds of landowners fought back. There are still more than 90 cases tied up in court a decade later, according to Terence Garrett, a border security expert with the University of Texas Rio Grande. So far, the government has spent nearly $80 million to compensate landowners to build the existing fencing. The Chicago Tribune reported that Customs and Border Protection \u201cestimates that it will spend an additional $21 million in real estate expenses associated with the remaining condemnation cases, not including about $4 million in Justice Department litigation costs.\u201d\n\nGarrett was personally involved in one of these fights in 2007, when the University of Texas Rio Grande successfully stopped the federal government from building an 18-foot border fence through campus. Instead, it built a 10-foot fence separating campus from a next-door golf course. Another golf course nearby was able to stop building altogether, Garrett said, adding that working-class neighborhoods were notably less successful in winning eminent domain cases. Some offered sentimental and emotional appeals \u2014 like the university\u2019s case that the wall would disrupt the bicultural, binational standing of the university. Others have said it would be bad for business.\n\nPut simply, government taking American citizens\u2019 private land is not a popular idea \u2014 especially in Texas, where most of these battles will go down. Garrett predicts private landowners will be even more driven to fight against Trump\u2019s wall.\n\n\u201cThe difference between this time and last time is that people know what happened last time,\u201d he said.\n\nIn California and Arizona, the government already has the rights to most of the border land. But Arizona is also home to the sovereign territory of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation reservation, which has already come out against building the wall. If the government attempts to build the wall through the 75 miles of sovereign territory in Arizona, it won\u2019t be anything short of a fight.\n\n\u201cYou would fundamentally have to change treaty arrangements with them,\u201d said Roger McManus, who is on the board of directors of the Friends of the Sonoran Desert National Monument, a nonprofit that works with federal agencies to protect the natural and cultural resources in Arizona and California. \u201cYou would see something that would surpass the [Dakota Access] pipeline situation.\u201d\n\nThen there are the environmental concerns. As Vox\u2019s Eliza Barclay and Sarah Frostenson reported, \u201cthe 654 miles of walls and fences already on the US-Mexico border have made a mess out of the environment there.\u201d\n\nWith fencing, Border Patrol has made some accommodations for migrating animals in the area \u2014 but depending on what this wall would look like, that might no longer be a workaround.\n\n7) Would building the wall even work?\n\nSomehow, as \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d became a way to taunt liberal college students and Latino basketball players, the idea of the wall as an actual policy got lost. Would the wall actually stop people from coming over the border without papers?\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fool ourselves,\u201d says former CBP Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar. \u201cIs there something that is going to guarantee 100 percent that we\u2019re going to seal the border? No, absolutely not.\u201d\n\nIt will never be impossible for someone who wants to enter the US to do so if they have the time, resources, and determination. The purpose of border security is to set that bar as high as possible \u2014 which means some people will be more easily deterred than others.\n\nSome will simply go under, over, or even through the wall. The best advantage a wall has over a fence is that it\u2019s harder to cut through; the Trump administration\u2019s contract request requires wall prototypes to be able to resist 30 to 90 minutes of drilling with hand tools. But the parts of the border where fencing is most effective (the San Diego area) are also the ones where the government has discovered the most, and most sophisticated, tunnels.\n\nIn 2012, DHS reported that it had discovered 140 tunnels over the past two decades \u2014 increasing from about five or six per year before 2008 to nearly 10 per year afterward. Many of those tunnels were described as \u201csophisticated\u201d systems with interlocking passageways and sometimes even lighting and flooring.\n\nThe San Diego fence didn\u2019t necessarily cause smugglers to build tunnels instead, but it certainly wasn\u2019t enough to prevent their construction. Furthermore, the very reason fencing is considered so helpful in San Diego \u2014 its urban density \u2014 made it easy for smugglers to build tunnels without detection: \u201cThe buildings on both sides of the border allow for the concealment of tunnel entry and exit points.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s the threat of drug smuggling drones being piloted across the border. Less futuristic, but more common, is the use of ultralight aircraft to smuggle drug loads over the heads of Border Patrol agents (a trend that\u2019s been simmering for several years). And even if a wall could stretch from sea to shining sea, committed smugglers and immigrants could get into boats or submarines.\n\nThe wall is more likely to block some kinds of illegal entries than others\n\nOr smugglers could just continue to do what many of them are doing anyway: cross the border \u201cthe right way\u201d \u2014 at a port of entry \u2014 with contraband in tow.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection doesn\u2019t make an effort to estimate how many drugs successfully enter the US \u2014 a spokesperson told Vox, \u201cWe can\u2019t track what we don\u2019t catch.\u201d But no one believes that agents are catching all the drugs (or people) that smugglers bring into the country through ports of entry, in specially outfitted trucks or thanks to bribing patrol agents. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s 2016 drug threat report says that Mexican drug smuggling organizations, in particular, prefer to send their product into the US through ports \u2014 and that hard drugs are particularly likely to be flown into the US, smuggled in on commercial flights.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that a wall does nothing. It means the wall is more likely to block some kinds of illegal entries than others. Individuals trying to come to the United States for work or family might successfully be deterred from crossing; cartels aiming to make millions of dollars in cocaine revenue probably will not.\n\nIf Border Patrol agents are being freed up to track down and investigate these \u201csophisticated\u201d criminal enterprises, because they no longer have to round up small groups of immigrants straggling through the desert, that could be one way to define success.\n\nChris Cabrera of the National Border Patrol Council says this is a strategy smugglers use now to distract border agents: \u201cThey know that Border Patrol agents are going to have to come in and apprehend these folks, sometimes 80 to 90 at a time, which is gonna deplete our lines, deplete our resources in the field. And once we pull out of other areas, they can bring across drugs or more high-value human cargo.\u201d A wall would have something like the opposite effect: reducing the distractions of \u201clow-value\u201d immigrant targets and freeing up agents to catch higher-level criminal activity.\n\nThere is some evidence that previous border security buildups have succeeded in deterring such \u201clow-value\u201d targets from coming to the US over the past decade (though some scholars argue that the Great Recession played a bigger role). There\u2019s even more evidence that it\u2019s deterred people who were caught once from trying to cross a second time. But it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s an indication that the US could be even more effective with even more enforcement, or that the government has already picked the low-hanging fruit.\n\nAll things considered, there simply aren\u2019t a lot of \u201clow-value\u201d immigrant targets still coming across the border. Certainly not compared with how many there were in 2000, or even in 2012. The people still coming to the US without papers are, increasingly, children and families from Central America trying to seek asylum \u2014 something that, legally speaking, they\u2019re supposed to be able to do by presenting themselves at ports of entry. If the wall is built, they\u2019re supposed to be able to meet someone at the door.\n\nThe most unrealistic expectation one could have of the wall is that it could reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the US. Most of the immigrants who are here have been in the US for more than a decade. If anything, the border security buildup back in the 1990s encouraged them to settle in the US and send for family members.\n\nBuilding a wall now wouldn\u2019t have the same sort of unintended consequences \u2014 for the simple reason that it\u2019s already happened. People have already settled. The existing barriers have already changed the border from a place where people can cross back and forth to one that people, at risk of their lives, hope to have to try to cross only once.\n\nWhether you see further enforcement as a worthwhile endeavor depends pretty strongly on whether you see deterring unauthorized migration, in any form \u2014 and to any extent \u2014 as an important and good thing. If you think of unauthorized immigrants as collateral damage in a war on crime \u2014 and see human smuggling, for example, as the inevitable impact of making it harder to get to the US \u2014 the effect of a wall on criminal organizations won\u2019t be enough to justify the effect on immigrants\u2019 lives.\n\nBut if you think of unauthorized immigration as something that strengthens criminal activity \u2014 either because you think \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d are themselves inherently criminal or because you think the demand for human smuggling is driving the supply of smugglers \u2014 disrupting immigrants for the sake of hypothetically, slightly, temporarily disrupting criminal organizations is a win-win.\n\nThe question then is whether the effect it\u2019s likely to have on disrupting unauthorized migration will be worth the money (and everything else) it costs to build it.\n\n8) Why is it so important for Trump to build the wall?\n\nThe wall is Trump\u2019s most identifiable campaign promise. Of course, not all of his voters thought he would literally build a wall to keep that promise \u2014 some didn\u2019t even want him to. Polls both before and after the election show that a border wall isn\u2019t a terribly popular idea, even among some Republicans.\n\nOne poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, in particular, shows that Republicans living within 350 miles of the US-Mexico border \u2014 the people closest to the putative wall \u2014 were the least likely to support it.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about Trump\u2019s voters. It\u2019s about his base.\n\nResearch indicates that many Americans \u2014 particularly white Americans, and particularly a strain of white conservative Americans especially concerned about immigration \u2014 are worried about immigration less as a legal issue than as a cultural threat, especially when it comes to Latino immigrants (whom they associate with a different way of life and also, often, with crime). Furthermore, those Americans tend to conflate \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d with \u201cimmigrants\u201d and \u201cimmigrants\u201d with \u201cLatinos\u201d \u2014 leading them to overstate the number of unauthorized immigrants in the country, and imagine more pouring in.\n\n\u201cThe average person, particularly if they don\u2019t live anywhere near the US-Mexico border, is probably not going to be able to make a judgment on how threatening the border is based on their own personal experience. What they tend to do is rely on statements made by sources of political information,\u201d says Christopher Federico of the University of Minnesota. Trump told them the border was lawless. Furthermore, he emphasized \u201cin-group/out-group\u201d distinctions like native-born Americans versus immigrants \u2014 and \u201cwith that usually comes a consciousness of threat.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump stirred up that threat. He may be able to calm it back down.\n\nIn a study published in 2016, researchers asked subjects how much of a threat they felt from Mexican immigration \u2014 and then had one group of subjects read an article that emphasized the security that already existed on the US-Mexico border, while another group read one emphasizing the border\u2019s permeability.\n\nSubjects who already felt threatened by Mexican migration and read about the weakness of the border were more likely to overestimate how close Mexico City was to the United States, and to overestimate the number of Mexican immigrants currently living in the US. But people who had felt threatened by Mexican immigration and then read about how strong the border was were likely to feel that Mexico City was further away from the US \u2014 and that the Mexican immigrant population was smaller \u2014 than it actually was.\n\nYou could conclude that the wall will help people threatened by immigration feel safer. Or you could conclude that how safe people feel the border is depends on whether they\u2019re told the border is safe or not.\n\nIf Trump wanted to declare victory on border security \u2014 with or without a wall \u2014 he might be able to persuade many of his supporters that immigration from the south was no longer a threat.\n\n\u201cTrump might say, \u2018Okay, we have built a wall, we have fixed this problem, it\u2019s getting better,\u2019\u201d Federico says. \u201cIf he very consistently sends a signal like that, and he\u2019s backed by other people in his party in saying the same thing, then I think you would expect to find that among Donald Trump supporters \u2014 and the public and Republicans more generally \u2014 they might think, \u2018Okay, the problem\u2019s getting better. We don\u2019t have to worry about this to the same extent that we used to.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe might not even need to build the wall first. The simple fact of having a Republican in office, Federico conjectures, might allow Republicans to worry a little less about border security \u2014 in the same way that partisans assume the economy is better when the president is a member of their party. But if Trump actively sent that message, it would be much more effective.\n\nAlready the Trump administration is trumpeting a drop in border apprehensions as a victory for the president\u2019s agenda \u2014 before a single brick (or transparent-but-still-impenetrable brick equivalent) has been laid.\n\nBut not every conservative is going along. Breitbart is pushing Trump officials on building a wall; Rush Limbaugh has already hinted he thinks the administration is caving on it. If that happens, Trump\u2019s base won\u2019t be getting a unified signal that the threat is over. What Trump thinks counts as a \u201cwall\u201d might, ultimately, be less important than what the Breitbart editorial board thinks.\n\n9) Are the costs going to be worth it?\n\nThe people who know better than anyone the costs we might pay for a wall are the people who live on the border.\n\n\u201cThose of us (who) have lived along the border have long understood that dealing with Washington\u2019s berrinches (tantrums) is just part of the deal,\u201d former Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza told Alfredo Corchado in an article published in Americas Quarterly earlier this year.\n\nThey\u2019ve known from the beginning that the border has been anything but nonexistent. They\u2019ve lived through its industrialization (or, as some might put it, militarization) \u2014 the fences, the expansion of Border Patrol, the surveillance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived on the border for almost 30 years now,\u201d says Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Center for Border Rights at the ACLU of New Mexico. \u201cIt used to be a much more fluid border, where people would cross more easily and have family on both sides. And now it just seems that we\u2019re more separated from each other.\u201d\n\nBut as disrupted as the lives of border residents already are, building a wall \u2014 or even starting to build a wall \u2014 would be something else. It would be permanent and destructive and implacable.\n\n\u201cWhat problem are we trying to solve?\u201d\n\nAlready the fear of a wall is reverberating through the economies of border communities. \u201cIndividuals are coming less and less to come shop at better stores on the US side,\u201d Gaubeca says. Developers in Brownsville, Texas, blamed the collapse of a planned multimillion-dollar development in the town on the fence that the government was building along the border in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe border is a region, and the people who are living there don\u2019t particularly want to be walled off from each other. Even Republican voters who live within 350 miles of the border \u2014 the people whom the president supposedly wants to protect \u2014 are much more ambivalent about it than those farther away.\n\n\u201cA lot of border communities think, \u2018Net migration is zero; there are already so many resources that we have\u2019\u201d for border security, Gaubeca says. \u201cWhat problem are we trying to solve?\u201d\n\nThe benefits of building a wall across the border are questionable at best \u2014 it\u2019s not clear whether doing more will be more effective than what already exists, or if the government is paying enough attention to make it more effective.\n\nBut the benefits won\u2019t show up until the end of what promises to be a very long and slow process. It\u2019s entirely possible that the effort will be started and then abandoned \u2014 or that the administration will abruptly shift to a \u201cvirtual wall\u201d in an effort to claim an easier win.\n\nThat might prevent some of the fallout from a wall \u2014 the environmental danger, the money spent in court cases. It won\u2019t work to reknit sundered halves of communities. The disruption of the border, as a region, is ongoing. Even considering a wall has symbolic power there. And every incremental step to turn the wall from symbol into reality works a little harder.",
