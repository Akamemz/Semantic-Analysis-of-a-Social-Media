    "content": "Obama , Romney Campaigns Taking 'See What Sticks ' Approach To Web Videos\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign , people on YouTube consumed a billion minutes of Barack Obama campaign videos . That adds up to almost 2,000 years .\nThis year , Obama and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney are on the way to leaving that figure in the dust . The campaigns are constantly releasing new Web videos .\nLee Rainie , who directs the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project , remembers when the rule for successful online videos was repetition .\n`` The old conventional wisdom was that you had to hammer home the same message consistently a lot of times before it would actually sort of penetrate the consciousness and begin to shape the opinion of voters , '' Rainie says .\nNow those days seem quaint . Today it 's all about constant stimulation , everywhere , all the time .\n`` People 's attention is so fragmented , their sources of information are so fragmented , that consistency does n't necessarily have the same power that it might have had in days gone by , '' Rainie says .\nCampaigns can easily churn out a new Web video every day \u2014 and they often do . But that does n't guarantee that they have an audience .\n`` A lot of these videos only have a few thousand views on YouTube , '' says Colin Delany , founder and editor of the website Epolitics.com . `` Often they 're not getting seen by a mass audience . ''\nThe viewership can be small , but it includes people with big megaphones .\nFor example , Whoopi Goldberg of ABC 's The View recently talked about an ad on air : `` A controversial new campaign ad for President Obama strongly implies that Mitt Romney would n't have made the call that led to a major victory in the war on terror . ''\nThat ad featured President Clinton reflecting on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden , saying , `` You hire the president to make the calls when no one else can do it . ''\nThe Obama folks never bought TV time for that video . But millions of people saw it anyway because it landed in their inboxes or on their Facebook pages .\n`` It 's a way to drive a message , '' says Brian Jones , who advises the Romney campaign . `` You 're not actually paying for anything other than the production value of the Web ad . And they 're usually pretty easy to produce , and you can do it pretty quickly . ''\nSo if Romney talks about Latino voters one day , there 's a Web ad bolstering that message . And if the next day , Obama slips up and says the private sector is doing fine , then you get an ad contrasting that statement with people talking about how they 're struggling .\n`` I have to work part time in order to make ends meet , '' one woman says in a Romney video . A man adds , `` Sometimes I feel like I 'm a failure . '' The ad reads : `` No , Mr. President , we are not 'doing fine . ' ''\nWith every new video , the campaigns learn more about what works and what does n't .\nBenjamin Edelman of Harvard Business School says Google has mastered this approach with its advertisers . The search engine advises companies to try as many variations on an ad as they can think of .\nOne version might advertise `` Boston Red Sox tickets . '' Another might say , `` Buy tickets to a Red Sox game . ''\n`` It 's not unusual for an advertiser to have hundreds or even thousands of different ads . Just churn them out in a variety of variations where you try every substitution of this word and that word and see what consumers seem to respond to , '' Edelman says .\nThe same is true in political Web videos . You might not think it makes any difference whether a candidate wears a white shirt or a plaid shirt . But it does , Edelman says .\n`` Now , you add something very different \u2014 like a different script , different look on the face , different body language \u2014 and the responses truly can differ by just an awful lot , '' he says .\nToday , instead of paying a consultant tens of thousands of dollars to opine on what works and hoping for the best , campaigns can afford to try a range of things and see what sticks .\nJones of the Romney campaign says his team is always learning and refining based on what spurs donations , volunteers and ultimately votes .\n`` We are able to monitor what people are looking at , what they 're responding to from a fundraising perspective , '' he says . `` And it 's important for the campaign to obviously keep a close eye on that and look to see what trends are developing from a Web ad perspective . ''\nThe things that work may find their way into candidate speeches and TV ads with real money behind them .\nLow production costs also mean the campaign can try off-kilter things they might not bother with otherwise .\nThe Obama campaign would not grant an interview with its digital director , Teddy Goff , but he recently gave a talk at Social Media Week , where he said : `` In 2008 , if we had been tinny or political or not local enough or not timely enough or if we just did n't strike the right emotional chords , that would have been bad and people might have disengaged .\n`` You know , in this election , they can not only disengage \u2014 they can disengage and then tweet about how disengaged they are . ''\nEvery campaign wants a video that goes viral . But the last thing they want is a clip that goes viral for the wrong reasons .",
