Jerry Brown , in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 reporter Doyle Rice , warned Thursday that the \u201c unprecedented \u201d drought parching his state will lead to a summer of forest fires and potential water shortages . \u2588\u2588\u2588\nWith all the attention focused on California 's water woes , an observer might conclude that the Golden State 's drought is the exception . It is n't . Forty states expect to see water shortages in at least some areas in the next decade , according to a government watchdog agency .\nIn a 2013 survey by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , state water managers from around the country said they expect freshwater shortages to continue into the next decade , even under what they described as `` average '' conditions . If those conditions change\u2014whether because of rapid population growth , unusually low snowfall or rainfall , or accelerated economic growth\u2014the situation could worsen .\n`` As far as other states , if they have n't seen it in the past , it 's something they will see in the future , '' said Ben Chou , a water policy analyst in the Los Angeles office of the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group .\nLate last month , Democratic California Gov . Jerry Brown implemented mandatory water conservation rules . The rules ban all restaurants , bars and hotels from serving water unless customers ask for it , ban the watering of lawns and landscaping within 48 hours of measurable rain , and require municipalities and private companies to limit lawn watering to two days a week .\nThe lawn-watering limits are likely to have the most impact , since outdoor irrigation makes up 44 percent of water use in the state 's urban and suburban communities , according to the state water board . The past three years have been the driest three years in California history dating to the 1849 Gold Rush , the board said . Low snowpack , combined with 2014 being the hottest year in history in the state , exacerbated the situation .\nResidents of other states should take a lesson from California , Chou said . `` Attention on California is due to the size of the state and the fact that we grow about half of the nation 's produce , '' he said . `` Other states have started looking at it , especially where water supplies are at a premium . ''\nMontana , for example , was listed in the GAO report as the state most likely to have a statewide water shortage in the next decade . Many other western states are in a similar predicament .\nTim Davis , Montana Water Resources Division administrator , said his department told the GAO that in any given year , any part of the state could have a water shortage . He said that last year , most of the state was fine , but the southwest corner was dry . Entering this irrigation season for farmers , Davis said the southwest region remains dry as is `` much more of the state . ''\nUnder direction from the Montana Legislature , Davis said his department has begun to plan for water shortages .\n`` Drought is one of those disasters that you have to plan for , '' he said . `` You ca n't just immediately go out there and change how you 're using water on the ground or invest in efficiencies unless you have been doing it all along . '' He said the state is making plans to share water between communities during times of drought , along with changing field irrigation methods to save water .\nCrisis has a way of focusing the mind . Take Texas , for example .\nAbout 36 percent of Texas is experiencing moderate or exceptional drought , according to Dr. Robert Mace , deputy executive administrator of the Texas Water Development Board . That actually represents an improvement . In 2011 , 100 percent of the state was experiencing drought , the first time that had happened since the state started keeping records in the 1880s .\nThe crisis grabbed the attention of Texas lawmakers , and in 2013 they sent a referendum to voters calling for $ 2 billion of the state 's rainy day fund to be used to leverage $ 27 billion in bonds to implement a state water conservation plan . The referendum passed with 74 percent of the vote .\nMace said the plan is being implemented as water demands in the state continue to grow . He said the population of Texas is expected to increase by 80 percent in the next 50 years . `` We are working with water providers , water managers , to try to plan for enough water in case of a repeat of the 'drought of record , ' '' he said . `` We are taking a cold , sober look at what the needs ( for ) water are going to be . ''\nThe plan includes allowing bordering communities to tap water from each other , and state money for emergency well drilling . `` The communities that really struggle with drought are the smaller communities , '' he said . `` ( State officials ) will go out and make suggestions on how to run their systems more efficiently . ''\nIn Kansas , drought conditions also are a little better this year . Last year , 93 percent of Kansas was facing severe drought , according to the U.S. Drought Monitor , but this year things have improved slightly , according to Tracy Streeter , director of the Kansas Water Office . The improvement is mostly due to more rainfall , which varies so much from year to year the state is forced to plan for the worst . The worst recorded drought was in 1952-57 . `` We try to benchmark to that point , '' Streeter said .\nIn a report to Republican Gov . Sam Brownback completed in January , the water office , along with other agencies and citizen groups , painted a bleak picture . The report notes that the Ogallala Aquifer is declining faster than it is recharging , and that reservoirs are filling with sediment . If nothing changes in the next 50 years , the report predicted , the Ogallala will be 70 percent depleted and the state 's reservoirs will be 40 percent filled with sediment .\nThe group called for the creation of a water resources subcabinet to advise the governor and a task force to develop financing for water resource management , including alternatives that utilize public-private partnerships .\nStreeter said the subcabinet has been created and will have its first meeting soon . But Kansas ' struggle to fill an estimated $ 340 million budget gap has stalled progress on the task force recommendation that the state find money to implement water conservation plans .\nWhile water problems are worst in the West , the East is not immune . According to the GAO report , North Carolina and Delaware are the eastern states most likely to experience regional water shortages in the next decade .\nKansas ' Streeter says more states in the East are asking for his advice as they prepare for a future with less water . `` Drought is insidious , it does n't land on you overnight , it creeps up on you , '' Streeter said . `` Agriculture feels it first\u2014you can start having crop failures within weeks of having no rain . Everybody else takes months . ''\nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor , the western part of North Carolina is already `` abnormally dry , '' though it does n't yet meet the `` drought '' definition .
