    "content": "On Saturday , Motherboard reported that an anti-diversity manifesto penned by James Damore , a software engineer at Google , had gone \u201c internally viral \u201d at the company\u2014and then , after Gizmodo obtained and published the 10-page document , it went viral-viral . The screed aired its author \u2019 s qualms with diversity and inclusion initiatives at Google , programs he deemed a waste of time because women are inherently less suited for technical roles than men . Or as he put it , in a faux-measured tone : \u201c I \u2019 m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don \u2019 t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. \u201d Throughout the memo , Damore dismisses internal programs that are supposed to address race and gender disparities at Google .\nWant to listen to this article out loud ? Hear it on \u2588\u2588\u2588 Voice .\nBy Monday evening , Google had fired Damore , he confirmed to Bloomberg , after Google CEO Sundar Pichai said his memo violated the firm \u2019 s code of conduct . But that came after the company had let the document circulate for days . After it leaked to the press , it generated so much blowback that Pichai cut his family vacation short to deal with the uproar .\nFiring an employee who made it clear he felt many of his co-workers were inferior was the right move , and it says something about what Google wants to be as a company . That someone felt comfortable disseminating the document in the first place , however , says even more about the company Google currently is . And the entire episode crystalizes the reckoning Silicon Valley is currently enduring , over why so many of the most forward-thinking companies in the world simply can \u2019 t seem to treat all of their employees equally and decently .\nDamore \u2019 s memo was shocking both to outsiders and to many employees within the company . But for Google\u2014and Silicon Valley writ large\u2014it was also not terribly surprising . The author , after all , was describing a company that has a technical workforce that is 80 percent male and majority white . And one where other apparent Googlers were willing to come to his defense . \u201c I \u2019 m impressed . It took serious guts to post that , \u201d responded one person in a thread on Blind , an app where tech employees can talk anonymously , obtained by Motherboard . \u201c I hope nothing happens to the guy. \u201d ( Only people with active Google.com email addresses could view the Google Doc where the memo was posted before it was leaked publicly . )\nAnother Blind commenter : \u201c The fella who posted that is extremely brave . We need more people standing up against the insanity . Otherwise \u2018 Diversity and Inclusion \u2019 which is essentially a pipeline from Women \u2019 s and African Studies into Google , will ruin the company . \u201d\nThere is no major U.S. corporation that thinks a gender imbalance like Google \u2019 s is tolerable , even as most have a long way to go toward improving that ratio . ( Google itself is under federal investigation by the Department of Labor for systematically underpaying female employees across its entire workforce . ) It is not radical to think a company ought to improve its employment of underrepresented groups . And in the face of that status quo , it is not shocking that Damore \u2019 s manifesto took many of its arguments from the fringe rhetoric of men \u2019 s rights activists , who misapply victim status to a group that retains every systemic advantage . And yet this document did find a receptive audience within one of the world \u2019 s most valuable companies , even as most people at the company appear to have had strong negative reactions to it . Still , as Erica Baker , a former software engineer at Google , pointed out , what we actually need to re-examine is why he felt so comfortable sharing his plainly bigoted views on a companywide site .\n\u201c What about the company culture sends the message that sharing sexism and racism will be accepted ? \u201d Baker asked in a Medium post after the memo emerged publicly . \u201c Do we want this to be an environment where racists and sexists feel safe and supported to share their views ? \u201d\nDamore deemed that it was suitable to share his views in a professional setting\u2014not , say , as an anonymous MRA enthusiast on 4chan but in an internally , widely circulated memo with his name on it . The new diversity and inclusion lead at Google , Danielle Brown , penned an internal response to the document in which she wrote that the engineer \u201c advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. \u201d And yet , as though to excuse his views , she continued that part of fostering inclusivity in Google means ensuring that those with \u201c different political views , feel safe sharing their opinions . \u201d\nBut as another ex-Googler , Cate Huston , wrote in another Medium post , the bigoted internal email didn \u2019 t reveal political views .
