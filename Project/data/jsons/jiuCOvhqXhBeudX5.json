Throughout the week , he has courted his evangelical supporters with his charge that governors are treating churches unfairly and his insistence that he wants to `` get the churches open . ''\nTrump said Friday that some governors have `` deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential , '' but have left out churches and other houses of worship . `` It 's not right . So I 'm correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential , '' he said during a brief statement at the White House .\n`` I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now . If there 's any question , they 're going to have to call me , but they 're not going to be successful in that call , '' Trump said . `` The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now , for this weekend .

We 're trying to find who are the 3 % or the 2 % . We 're looking for them , right ?

'' )\nDespite the encouraging news from Birx about the decline in the rate of positive cases , the holiday weekend could also mark another grim moment in the pandemic as the number of deaths in the US approached 100,000 .\n`` We think we 're going to hit the milestone of 100,000 deaths over the four-day weekend , '' said Dr. Chris Murray , the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , which has produced one of the most influential coronavirus models .\nLooking ahead to the holiday weekend , Birx said Americans could get outside with a long list of caveats . Some Americans could play golf , she said , for example , if they are `` very careful '' and `` do n't touch the flags . '' She suggested playing tennis with `` marked balls '' and just one other person so `` you 're only touching your ball . ''\nThis weekend , if Americans want to do some kind of social gathering , `` it 's very important to maintain that six feet distance and very important to have your mask with you in case that six feet distance can not be maintained , '' Birx said .\n`` We are asking continuously for you all to be outside , to enjoy your Memorial Day weekend ; to play golf ; to hike as Dr. ( Anthony ) Fauci said ; to play tennis with marked balls -- and to be out with your families that you have been in the household with ; and even consider sharing socially distanced space as long as you have utensils that belong to individuals and that maybe can be thrown out immediately , '' Birx said . `` There 's a lot of things to think through .

''\nWhen asked about Trump 's declaration that churches and houses of worship should reopen , Birx said faith community leaders should be in touch with their local health departments to check the number of new cases in their zip codes , so they can communicate the risks to congregants .\n`` Certainly people that have significant co-morbidities , we want them protected .
