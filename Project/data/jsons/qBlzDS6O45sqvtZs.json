    "content": "Would Romney , Already Looked At Skeptically By The Right , Pick Rice ?\nPretty soon we 'll be obsessing full time over Mitt Romney 's running mate selection , but until then I thought I 'd weigh in one on Veepstakes story that 's been making the rounds in recent days .\nI 'm talking about the rumors , first appearing Thursday in the Drudge Report , that former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has surged to the top of Romney 's wish list . The supposed book on Rice : she cuts into President Obama 's African-American and female vote , and has foreign policy smarts . Sarah Palin , who knows a thing or three about the importance of the vetting process , chimed in , saying Rice would make a `` wonderful '' vice president . And what about the fact that Rice supports abortion rights ? Palin said that we `` need to remember '' that `` it 's not the vice president that would legislate abortion , and that would be Congress 's role . And we 'll keep that in mind . '' Somehow I do n't remember hearing that argument when Tom Ridge 's name was being discussed as vice-presidential material .\nIn any event , one would assume a Rice for Veep pick is not palatable for many conservatives , and that certainly includes Marjorie Dannenfelser , the president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List , who offered this statement :\n`` Former Secretary Rice 's position on the sanctity of human life makes her an unqualified candidate for Governor Romney to choose as a running mate . Throughout the campaign , including at the Palmetto Freedom Forum last September , he has pledged to us in no uncertain terms that he would choose a pro-life running mate . We have taken Governor Romney at his word and therefore believe Secretary Rice will be ruled out of consideration . Secretary Rice 's position violates criteria that Governor Romney himself has laid out . ''\nBen Jacobs , writing in The Daily Beast , explains why choosing Rice would be problematic :\n`` Ever since starting his first presidential campaign in 2006 , the former Massachusetts governor has faced a higher level of scrutiny from conservatives for his record on social issues . Romney , who ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 as a pro-choice candidate who would be 'better than Ted [ Kennedy ] on gay rights , ' has had to backtrack considerably since . He has vowed to be 'severely conservative ' and spent his presidential primary combating attacks that he was simply ' a Massachusetts moderate . ' The result has left Romney uniquely vulnerable to criticism from the Republican base . ''\nI agree . Compared to every Republican presidential nominee you can think of in recent decades , no one is looked at with more suspicion from conservatives than Romney . ( And that includes John McCain , Palin 's benefactor , who broke with the GOP on many issues , such as the Bush tax cuts , immigration and campaign finance legislation . ) Given Romney 's problems with the base , choosing a running mate who supports abortion rights would be an invitation for a right-wing revolt .\nLost in all this has been Rice 's repeated assertions that she has no interest in being vice president or becoming a candidate of any kind . And for all we know , the Rice trial balloon may have been one person 's way of trying to change the subject from Bain Capital .\n( But if lo and behold it turned out that she was the pick , that would be great news for Demas Jasper of Salt Lake City , Utah . Demas was the first person to predict Rice in my `` Guess The VP '' contest from last April . )\nThere is another blockbuster I 'd like to share with you . Five times , between last Thursday night and Friday morning , I received the same e-mail from Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades giving me a tremendous hint about when the VP choice will be made . When you send something five times , you know it has to be significant . And it was :\n`` We 're getting ready to share some exciting news . Sometime between now and the Republican convention , Mitt will be announcing his choice for VP . ''\nThis is pretty remarkable , given the fact that I always expected Romney to announce his choice in October . Well , you heard it here first . Still , it 's not as remarkable as this e-mail , which comes from Jennifer Petty , the executive director of 21st Century Democrats :\n`` Soon Mitt Romney will make his choice for vice president , and we 're curious who you think he will pick . ... It 's such an important choice , and it can also blow up in your face if you pick wrong . Look what happened to George Bush when he added Dan Quayle to the ticket . But in the last election , John McCain 's campaign regained momentum with his choice of Sarah Palin , which energized the right wing of the Republican Party . ''\nI kind of sat there for a bit after reading this . Is Jennifer saying that the Quayle pick in 1988 was bad and the Palin pick was good ?\nAnyway , good or bad , here 's another look at my tortured record at predicting vice-presidential running mates .

''\nThere has been a disturbing increase of people , in trying to make a political point , who compare their foes to Hitler , Nazis , the Gestapo , etc . It is , in my opinion , shameful and despicable . Disagree all you want , but comparing opponents to what went on in Germany in the 1930s is crossing a line that should not be crossed . However , I expressed myself this way on the show :\n`` We 've heard this kind of rhetoric from both sides , going back for several years now , and it 's just getting out of hand , between George W. Bush being a Nazi , Barack Obama being a Nazi . ... The Holocaust and what happened back then was pretty horrific , and to describe arms of the government as being Gestapo-related or Nazi-related or fascist-related or communist-related , you are inciting people , and it 's just a very dangerous bit of rhetoric that just does n't seem to stop . ''\nBut it was my `` we 've heard this kind of rhetoric from both sides '' that prompted Jim to call in from Iowa City , who complained I\n`` ... just brushed it off as name-calling on both sides and created some sort of equivalency , and there really is no equivalency .

There were other such instances .\nDo I think it 's gotten worse since Jan. 20 , 2009 ? I do , certainly . And maybe I did come off as more dismissive than I should have . But my point was not to list the number of times Democrats said it and compare it to the number of times Republicans said it .

Gore won Iowa by 4,144 votes ; Buchanan got 5,731 votes in the state . Did Bush lose Iowa because of Buchanan ? There are more examples . Gore 's margin was just 366 in New Mexico , where Buchanan took 1,392 votes . Gore also won Oregon ( by 6,765 votes ) and Wisconsin ( by 5,708 ) by a smaller amount than what Buchanan received . Perhaps , if Gore had won the election , Republicans would have blamed Buchanan for Bush 's defeat .\nQ : Your Pete McCloskey button [ see `` This Day In Campaign History , '' Political Junkie , July 9 , 2012 ] took me back . My first presidential campaign ( at age 20 ) was for George McGovern in New Mexico in 1972 , where I ran Dona Ana County for him ( as a volunteer -- ah , the good old days ... ) . But the reason I mention it is that McCloskey won his only delegate from New Mexico Republicans , winning just enough votes to qualify for the one . The Nixon-controlled GOP , however , would not let an actual McCloskey delegate go in that slot -- so a supporter of Nixon went instead . \u2014 Steve Cobble , Washington , D.C .\nA : McCloskey , who had already dropped out of race , received six percent of the vote in the 1972 New Mexico primary , enough for a delegate . McCloskey hoped that delegate would give a nominating speech for him at the convention but , as you said , Republican officials would n't let that happen .\nLet the record also show that Keith Judd , a convicted felon currently incarcerated in Texas , won 41 percent of the vote against President Obama in the West Virginia primary this year . And John Wolfe , a Tennessee attorney , took 40 percent against Obama in Arkansas . But neither Judd nor Wolfe will have any delegates in Charlotte .\nQ : I love the `` Ken Rudin for President button '' in this week 's ScuttleButton contest . I 'd vote for him , but he would probably establish Rudin-care , which would require everyone to laugh at his jokes or pay a tax . I mean , a penalty . Or maybe it is a tax .

The existence of the tapes could well answer the question raised in earlier testimony by former White House Counsel John Dean as to whether or not President Nixon was aware of the efforts to coverup the Watergate scandal (July 16, 1973).\n\nGot a question?
