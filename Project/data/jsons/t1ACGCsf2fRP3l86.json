That brings the total number of people applying for benefits over the previous six weeks to more than 30 million .\nIt \u2019 s a staggering number of people who have filed for unemployment since the coronavirus pandemic triggered nationwide shutdowns and a severe economic downturn weeks ago . In late March , the Labor Department registered 3.3 million jobless claims in a single week , shattering previous records . And each subsequent week , the figures released are of a magnitude that would have seemed unimaginable months ago : 6.9 million , 6.6 million , 5.2 million , 4.4 million .

But the next unemployment report is sure to be ugly : The US economy shrank by 4.8 percent in the first quarter of the year . Analysts and experts estimate the unemployment rate could reach 13 , 20 , even 30 percent in the months to come .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Matt Yglesias recently noted , there are caveats to Thursday \u2019 s jobless claims .\nThe Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act , or CARES Act \u2014 the $ 2.2 trillion stimulus President Donald Trump signed into law in March \u2014 expands the scope of people who can apply for and collect unemployment benefits .
