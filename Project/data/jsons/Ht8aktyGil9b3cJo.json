Holy God , what a clown show the Trump-Russia investigation was .\nLike the much-ballyhooed report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , the Horowitz report is a Rorschach test , in which partisans will find what they want to find .\nMuch of the press is concentrating on Horowitz \u2019 s conclusion that there was no evidence of \u201c political bias or improper motivation \u201d in the FBI \u2019 s probe of Donald Trump \u2019 s Russia contacts , an investigation Horowitz says the bureau had \u201c authorized purpose \u201d to conduct .\nHorowitz uses phrases like \u201c serious performance failures , \u201d describing his 416-page catalogue of errors and manipulations as incompetence rather than corruption . This throws water on the notion that the Trump investigation was a vast frame-up .\nHowever , Horowitz describes at great length an FBI whose \u201c serious \u201d procedural problems and omissions of \u201c significant information \u201d in pursuit of surveillance authority all fell in the direction of expanding the unprecedented investigation of a presidential candidate ( later , a president ) .\nOfficials on the \u201c Crossfire Hurricane \u201d Trump-Russia investigators went to extraordinary , almost comical lengths to seek surveillance authority of figures like Trump aide Carter Page . In one episode , an FBI attorney inserted the words \u201c not a source \u201d in an email he \u2019 d received from another government agency . This disguised the fact that Page had been an informant for that agency , and had dutifully told the government in real time about being approached by Russian intelligence . The attorney then passed on the email to an FBI supervisory special agent , who signed a FISA warrant application on Page that held those Russian contacts against Page , without disclosing his informant role .\nLikewise , the use of reports by ex-spy/campaign researcher Christopher Steele in pursuit of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) authority had far-reaching ramifications .\nNot only did obtaining a FISA warrant allow authorities a window into other Trump figures with whom Page communicated , they led to a slew of leaked \u201c bombshell \u201d news stories that advanced many public misconceptions , including that a court had ruled there was \u201c probable cause \u201d that a Trump figure was an \u201c agent of a foreign power . \u201d\nThere are too many to list in one column , but the Horowitz report show years of breathless headlines were wrong . Some key points :\nThe so-called \u201c Steele dossier \u201d was , actually , crucial to the FBI \u2019 s decision to seek secret surveillance of Page .\nPress figures have derided the idea that Steele was crucial to the FISA application , with some insisting it was only a \u201c small part \u201d of the application . Horowitz is clear :\nWe determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team \u2019 s receipt of Steele \u2019 s election reporting on September 19 , 2016 played a central and essential role in the FBI \u2019 s and Department \u2019 s decision to seek the FISA order .\nThe report describes how , prior to receiving Steele \u2019 s reports , the FBI General Counsel ( OGC ) and/or the National Security Division \u2019 s Office of Intelligence ( OI ) wouldn \u2019 t budge on seeking FISA authority . But after getting the reports , the OGC unit chief said , \u201c receipt of the Steele reporting changed her mind on whether they could establish probable cause . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the OI unit chief said Steele \u2019 s reports were \u201c what kind of pushed it over the line. \u201d There \u2019 s no FISA warrant without Steele .\nDemocrats are not going to want to hear this , since conventional wisdom says former House Intelligence chief Devin Nunes is a conspiratorial evildoer , but the Horowitz report ratifies the major claims of the infamous \u201c Nunes memo . \u201d\nAs noted , Horowitz establishes that the Steele report was crucial to the FISA process , even using the same language Nunes used ( \u201c essential \u201d ) . He also confirms the Nunes assertion that the FBI double-dipped in citing both Steele and a September 23 , 2016 Yahoo ! news story using Steele as an unnamed source . Horowitz listed the idea that Steele did not directly provide information to the press as one of seven significant \u201c inaccuracies or omissions \u201d in the first FISA application .\nHorowitz also verifies the claim that Steele was \u201c closed for cause \u201d for talking to the media , i.e . officially cut off as a confidential human source to the FBI . He shows that Steele continued to talk to Justice Official Bruce Ohr before and after Steele \u2019 s formal relationship with the FBI ended . His report confirms that the Steele information had not been corroborated when the FISA application was submitted , another key Nunes point .\nThere was gnashing of teeth when Nunes first released his memo in January , 2018 . The press universally crapped on his letter , with a Washington Post piece calling it a \u201c joke \u201d and a \u201c sham. \u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Nunes for the release of a \u201c bogus \u201d document , while New York Senator Chuck Schumer said the memo was intended to \u201c sow conspiracy theories and attack the integrity of federal law enforcement. \u201d Many called for his removal as Committee chair .\nThe Horowitz report says all of that caterwauling was off-base . It also undercuts many of the assertions made in a ballyhooed response letter by Nunes counterpart Adam Schiff , who described the FBI \u2019 s \u201c reasonable basis \u201d for deeming Steele credible . The report is especially hostile to Schiff \u2019 s claim that the FBI \u201c provided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele \u2019 s reporting . \u201d\nIn fact , far from confirming the Steele material , the FBI over time seems mainly to have uncovered more and more reasons to run screaming from Steele , to wit :\nThe \u201c Steele dossier \u201d was \u201c Internet rumor , \u201d and corroboration for the pee tape story was \u201c zero . \u201d\nThe Steele report reads like a pile of rumors surrounded by public information pulled off the Internet , and the Horowitz report does nothing to dispel this notion .\nAt the time the FBI submitted its first FISA application , Horowitz writes , it had \u201c corroborated limited information in Steele \u2019 s election reporting , and most of that was publicly available information. \u201d Horowitz says of Steele \u2019 s reports : \u201c The CIA viewed it as \u2018 internet rumor . \u2019 \u201d\nWorse ( and this part of the story should be tattooed on the heads of Russia truthers ) , the FBI \u2019 s interviews of Steele \u2019 s sources revealed Steele embellished the most explosive parts of his report .\nThe \u201c pee tape \u201d story , which inspired countless grave headlines ( see this chin-scratching New York Times history of Russian \u201c sexual blackmail \u201d ) and plunged the Trump presidency into crisis before it began , was , this source said , based a \u201c conversation that [ he/she ] had over beers , \u201d with the sexual allegations made\u2026 in \u201c jest \u201d !\nSteele in his report said the story had been \u201c confirmed \u201d by senior , Western hotel staff , but the actual source said it was all \u201c rumor and speculation , \u201d never confirmed . In fact , charged by Steele to find corroboration , the source could not : corroboration was \u201c zero , \u201d writes Horowitz .\nMeanwhile the Steele assertions that Russians had a kompromat file on Hillary Clinton , and that there was a \u201c well-developed conspiracy of coordination \u201d between the Trump campaign and Russians , relied on a source Steele himself disparaged as an \u201c egoist \u201d and \u201c boaster \u201d who \u201c may engage in some embellishment. \u201d This was known to the FBI at the start , yet they naturally failed to include this info in the warrant application , one of what Horowitz described as \u201c 17 significant errors or omissions \u201d in the FISA application .\nFinally , when the FBI conducted an investigation into Steele \u2019 s \u201c work-related performance , \u201d they heard from some that he was \u201c smart , \u201d and a \u201c person of integrity , \u201d and \u201c if he reported it , he believed it . \u201d\nTheir notes stated : \u201c [ d ] emonstrates lack of self-awareness , poor judgment ; \u201d \u201c [ k ] een to help \u201d but \u201c underpinned by poor judgment ; \u201d \u201c Judgment : pursuing people with political risk but no intel value ; \u201d \u201c [ d ] idn \u2019 t always exercise great judgment- sometimes [ he ] believes he knows best ; \u201d and \u201c [ r ] eporting in good faith , but not clear what he would have done to validate . \u201d\nThe Crossfire Hurricane team got all of this , but , again , didn \u2019 t pass it upstairs or include any of it in its warrant application .\nI \u2019 ve written about how reporters used sleight of hand to get the Steele dossier into print without putting it through a vetting process .
