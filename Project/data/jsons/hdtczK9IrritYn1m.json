Mike Leara said Tuesday that he considers his bill a statement of principle . It would make lawmakers guilty of a felony punishable by up to four years in prison if they introduce legislation restricting gun rights .\n`` I have no illusions about the bill making it through the legislative process , but I want it to be clear that the Missouri House will stand in defense of the people 's constitutional right to keep and bear arms , '' Leara , a Republican from suburban St. Louis , said in a written statement . He declined further comment .\nSince last year 's deadly mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut , state and federal lawmakers have grappled with gun legislation . President Barack Obama has proposed an assault weapons ban , background checks and restrictions on high-capacity ammunition magazines . But Missouri 's Republican-led Legislature has taken a different approach -- more guns , not less .\nState Rep. Stacey Newman , D-St. Louis , called Leara 's measure `` unconstitutional '' and said she would go directly to prison if the bill passes . Newman is the sponsor of a measure that would require guns to be sold by a licensed dealer and force that dealer to conduct a background check .\nEven one of Leara 's fellow Republicans said he probably would n't support the bill .\n`` Everybody should have a right to introduce bills , even bad ones , '' said state Rep. Kevin Engler , of Farmington , a former state senator who has sponsored National Rifle Association-supported legislation in previous years .\nLeara 's measure comes less than a week after St. Louis-area House Democrats introduced legislation containing an assault weapons ban . That bill would require owners of semi-automatic weapons to surrender , destroy or send their guns to another state within 90 days of the measure 's passage . Sponsoring state Rep. Rory Ellinger said he knows Missouri is a very conservative state , but he still wants a dialogue on gun safety .\nGiven the two-thirds Republican majority in the Legislature , the assault weapons ban probably wo n't even get a committee hearing .
