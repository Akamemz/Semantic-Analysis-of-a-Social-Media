    "content": "Satanist And Christian Holiday Displays To Go Up At Michigan Capitol\nTwo very different holiday displays will share the grounds of the Michigan State Capitol next week : a traditional Christian Nativity and an exhibit by the Satanic Temple . The situation has brought controversy \u2014 and energized Christians who realized that a planned Nativity was in danger of being canceled .\nThe story drew intense attention after it emerged that there was a chance the Capitol grounds might host only a Satanic holiday display during the Christmas season , because plans for a Christian display did n't take into account Michigan 's rules .\nThe Detroit chapter of the Satanic Temple had sought to put up its exhibit as a message about religious freedom and inclusiveness , as a counterweight to the Christian Nativity ( the group is putting up a similar display at Florida 's Capitol rotunda ) .\nThe Satanic Temple received official approval for its holiday display after the Capitol staff consulted the state attorney general 's office .\n`` It 's a First Amendment right , '' says Capitol Facility Director Dan Brocklehurst .\nThe permit for the Christian Nativity had been filed from outside Michigan . But the state 's rules require Capitol holiday displays to be taken down by 11 o'clock every night . When the organizer realized he would n't be able to comply , `` they kind of withdrew their request , '' Brocklehurst says .\nThat left the field to the Satanic Temple , feeding the impression in some quarters that the state had decided that instead of a Nativity scene , its grounds would host a Satanic exhibit that features a snake and the words `` The Greatest Gift is Knowledge . ''\n`` A lot of the Christians felt we denied the Nativity scene , '' Brocklehurst says . But he adds that the situation changed when people realized the out-of-state permit was at risk of being withdrawn because of a lack of local support .\nLed by state Sen. Rick Jones , who said earlier this week that he was `` a little outraged that a Satanic group has decided to steal a Christian holiday , '' a group of volunteers stepped forward to put up a donated Nativity scene and take it down each day .\nA Christian Nativity will now be erected on the Capitol grounds , starting Friday morning . The Satanic Temple 's display will join it on Sunday .\nNext to the displays , Capitol staff will erect signs reminding visitors that `` this exhibit is not owned , maintained , promoted , supported by or associated with '' the state of Michigan , Brocklehurst says .\nBoth of the exhibits will also be placed where security cameras will let Capitol staff keep an eye on them .\n`` We want to be sure they 're both secure and not subject to vandalism while they 're on Capitol grounds , '' says Brocklehurst , who acknowledges that the dueling displays have put Michigan officials `` in new territory . ''\nAccording to the Satanic Temple 's website , the group 's mission is `` to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people , '' while embracing `` practical common sense and justice . ''\nAs for its mission in Michigan , Jex Blackmore , director of the Satanic Temple 's Detroit chapter , says the Christmas display `` draws attention to a policy that 's clearly intended to support the display of mainstream religious iconography while excluding others . ''\nShe adds that the Satanic Temple is hoping the holiday display episode will serve as an example to the state Legislature , where the Michigan Religious Freedom and Restoration Act has stirred debate over allowing people and businesses to claim exemptions from state laws owing to their religious beliefs .\nBlackmore says , `` Many of us suspect [ it 's ] shortsighted in that it does n't account for the multiple religions that may seek privilege and exemption under its umbrella . ''\nAnd she says that the idea of erecting non-Christian holiday displays might spread .\n`` We 've inspired a lot of enthusiasm , and other chapters of The Satanic Temple are looking into the possibility of submitting displays across the nation , '' Blackmore says . `` It 's a bit late in the season now , but I feel the next year 's holiday season will see a lot more in the way of Satanic displays . ''\nWhile the situation has brought a burst of attention to Michigan 's Capitol staff , it has also created a unique circumstance for Brocklehurst , who says he 's `` very committed '' to his Christian faith .\nOn Sunday , Brocklehurst will visit the state Capitol to review the Satanic Temple display \u2014 before continuing on to attend worship services at his church .",
