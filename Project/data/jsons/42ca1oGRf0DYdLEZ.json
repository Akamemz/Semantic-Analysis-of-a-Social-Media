    "content": "President Donald Trump has become the third president in history to be impeached after the House voted to approve both articles of impeachment over his request of Ukraine to investigate political rivals .\nAfter a day of tense debate and fiery recriminations , the House voted largely along partisan lines , reshuffling American politics at time when voters are profoundly divided over the nation \u2019 s leadership and direction .\nThe Democratic-led House approved both articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing his power by asking Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit his reelection and of obstructing Congress .\nEvery Democrat voted for the first article except Reps. Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota . Rep. Jared Golden of Maine joined Van Drew and Peterson as the only Democrats to vote against the second article , obstruction of Congress .\nEvery Republican voted against both articles . The House \u2019 s lone independent , former Republican Justin Amash of Michigan , voted with the Democrats to impeach Trump on both charges .\nThe 230 votes to impeach Trump on the first article is slightly higher than the 228 votes that one of the articles against President Bill Clinton received in 1998 .\nBut Republicans are gleeful about the fact that , unlike in 1998 , no one on their side crossed party lines to vote to impeach one of their own .\n`` Every single Republican voted for us , '' Trump crowed at his rally . \u201c We did n't lose one Republican vote . ''\nLawmakers are now voting on a second article , charging Trump with obstructing their investigation .\nThough the historic vote ended a hurried effort by Democrats to advance impeachment articles before the end of the year \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the inquiry into Trump \u2019 s actions less than three months ago \u2013 it will kick off an exceptionally rare trial in the Senate to determine whether the president will be removed from office .\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the impeachment culminated in one of the most shameful episodes in history .\n\u201c Throughout the House Democrats \u2019 entire sham impeachment , the President was denied fundamental fairness and due process under the law , \u201d Grisham said in a statement . \u201c The House blatantly ignored precedent and conducted the inquiry in secrecy behind closed doors so that Chairman Adam Schiff and his partisan political cronies could selectively leak information to their partners in the media to push a false narrative . \u201c\n\u201c The President is confident the Senate will restore regular order , fairness , and due process , all of which were ignored in the House proceedings , \u201d Grisham said . \u201c He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated . President Trump will continue to work tirelessly to address the needs and priorities of the American people , as he has since the day he took office . \u201d\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii , who voted present on both articles of impeachment , said she worked for the best interests of the country whether in the military or in Congress .\n\u201c After doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report , I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no , \u201d Gabbard said in a statement . \u201c I am standing in the center and have decided to vote Present . I could not in good conscience vote against impeachment because I believe President Trump is guilty of wrongdoing . I also could not in good conscience vote for impeachment because removal of a sitting President must not be the culmination of a partisan process , fueled by tribal animosities that have so gravely divided our country . \u201d\nSome lawmakers used cards to vote , rather than recording their preference electronically as is usually the practice .\n\u201c They want to actually write down their vote instead of doing it electronically on a vote of this gravity and significance , \u201d said Rep. Katherine Clark , D-Mass , who voted electronically .\nRepublicans rushed to grab the red cards , using a dais to scribble their names , state and district before waving them above their hands .\nRep. Steve King , R-Iowa , said the red and green cards were being used as \u201c more of a demonstration \u201d to show the force behind the vote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty lame , but it \u2019 s what we got , \u201d King said of the demonstration .\nThe debate drew to a close with final remarks from party leaders \u2013 some of which elicited immediate pushback from the other side .\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise , R-La. , drew groans from Democrats when he accused them of not only hating Trump , but also hating the 63 million Americans who voted for him . Republicans groaned back .\n\u201c It is an abuse of power , \u201d Scalise said . \u201c It \u2019 s your abuse of power . \u201d\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , said Trump was given every opportunity to prove his innocence .\n\u201c Democrats did not choose this impeachment . We did not wish for it , \u201d he said . `` Oh , come on , '' several Republicans responded .\nLawmakers filled the House floor and most seats in the spectator gallery were taken when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , taunted his Democratic colleagues with something he said they hate to hear .\n\u201c Donald J. Trump is president of the United States , \u201d McCarthy said , eliciting a standing ovation from his GOP colleagues . \u201c He \u2019 s president today . He will be president tomorrow . And he will be president when this impeachment is over . \u201d\nThroughout Rep. Adam Schiff \u2019 s speech , he looked at Republicans , speaking directly to them as he implored for them to uphold the Constitution over their loyalty to the president .\n\u201c What is at risk here is the very idea of America , \u201d he said .\nRepublicans , in response , booed Schiff , some laughing or shouting things at him .\nAfter a full day of contentious debate and without a closing comment from Pelosi , the House began voting at 8:09pm on the first of two articles of impeachment : whether Trump committed an abuse of power by pressuring Ukraine to undertake investigations that would help him politically .\nDemocrats are expected to have the 216 votes needed to pass the article . All Republicans are expected to oppose it .\nThe chamber is full enough many lawmakers and staffers from both parties are standing in the back of their respective sides .\nSome of the moderate Democrats who have the most at stake politically and who helped tipped Pelosi \u2019 s hand on beginning the impeachment inquiry entered the chamber together shortly before the voting began .\n\u201c See you on the other end , \u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin , D-Mich. , who represents a district Trump won in 2016 .\nOne Democrat , freshman Rep. Jared Golden of Maine , has said he will vote for the first article but not for the second , which charges Trump with obstructing Congress in its investigation. \u201c We have bipartisan opposition to impeachment , not bipartisan support , \u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C .\nTrump struck an upbeat tone after arriving in Battle Creek for a rally as the House neared conclusion of the impeachment debate .\n\u201c Doing good , \u201d he said to shouted questions from reporters as he deplaned from Air Force One and climbed into his limousine .\nAbout 150 people who \u2019 d braved Michigan \u2019 s below-freezing temperatures to wait for Trump \u2019 s arrival cheered him on .\nAfter calling impeachment an embarrassment for House Democrats , Rep. Lee Zeldin , R-N.Y. , laid into House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff .\nZeldin repeated GOP complaints about the way Schiff handled the impeachment inquiry , concluding : \u201c It \u2019 s a total Schiff show . \u201d\nZeldin is not the first Republican to use that wordplay on Schiff \u2019 s last name .\nIn November , Trump was even more explicit when he tweeted : \u201c Gee , Pelosi & Schitt have a good idea , \u2018 lets Impeach the President . \u2019 \u201d\nFor his part , Schiff smiled as he returned to the microphone after Zeldin 's remarks .\nFrom a 'perfect ' call to a party switch : How we got to the impeachment of Donald Trump\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , tried to rebut the Republican argument that there 's no impeachable offense because Ukraine eventually received the delayed military funds .\n\u201c My colleagues continue to make the argument that the Ukrainians got the money , \u201d Schiff said . \u201c Yes , the president got caught but they got the money , no harm , no foul . It \u2019 s the equivalent of saying , ` If you \u2019 re pulled over by a cop and you attempt to bribe the cop , and the cop doesn \u2019 t take the money but arrests you , where \u2019 s the crime in that ? ' \u201d\nSchiff 's comments drew booing from the Republican side of the chamber .\nMichigan Rep. Justin Amash , an independent who left the Republican Party last summer , was welcomed on the Democratic side of the House with pats on the shoulder and handshakes from smiling colleagues after saying he would vote to impeach Trump .\n\u201c His actions reflect precisely the type of conduct the framers of the Constitution intended to remedy through the power of impeachment , \u201d Amash said .\nHe was the only Republican in the House to call for Trump \u2019 s impeachment following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and its aftermath earlier this year .\nAmash said Wednesday that Trump abused and violated the public trust by soliciting the aid of a foreign power for his own personal and political gain .\nHe told \u2588\u2588\u2588 after his floor remarks that he might have been able to convince his former Republican colleagues to vote for impeachment earlier in the process . But , Amash added , \u201c The deeper we \u2019 ve gotten into it , the more people feel like they have to stick with their team , if you will , to survive . \u201d\nSome Democrats have approached Amash about helping present the case against Trump when the proceedings move to the Senate .\nAsked if he \u2019 s interested in being an impeachment manager , Amash replied : \u201c I \u2019 m happy to have a conversation with the speaker . \u201d\nWhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been the Democrats \u2019 face of impeachment , Adam Schiff has been the workhorse of the effort .\nAs chair of the House Intelligence Committee , the California Democrat led the sharp questioning of key witnesses that laid out Trump \u2019 s role in Ukraine . And he has been able to succinctly articulate the complexities of the committee \u2019 s findings to the public .\nHalfway through Wednesday \u2019 s floor debate , Schiff stepped up to the dais to summarize the testimony and characterize the president as someone consumed by personal advancement .\n\u201c He doesn \u2019 t care about Ukraine or the impact on our national security caused by withholding military aid to that country fighting for its democratic life , \u201d he said . \u201c All that matters to this president is what affects him personally : an investigation into his political rival and a chance to cheat in the next election . \u201d\nLater , Schiff turned to his GOP colleagues and chided them for choosing party over country .\n\u201c Many of my colleagues appear to have made their choice to protect the president , to enable him to be above the law , to empower this president to cheat again as long as it is in the service of their party and their power , \u201d he said . \u201c They have made their choice and I believe they will rue the day that they did . \u201d\nOne of the most fiery exchanges came after Rep. Louie Gohmert , R-Texas , accused Democrats of using impeachment to stop an investigation into Ukraine \u2019 s interference in the 2016 election .\nDemocrats have noted that U.S. intelligence services found that Russia meddled in the election and FBI Director Christopher Wray told ABC News that there is \u201c no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election . \u201d\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , said it was \u201c deeply concerned that any member of the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the House . \u201d\nRussia has blamed Ukraine for its own interference in the election .\nGohmert , who was still at his lectern , pointed at Nadler and said he should get a chance to respond , but he was n't recognized .\n`` He calls me guilty of Russian propaganda , '' Gohmert shouted over the pounding of the gavel . Gohmert walked past Nadler as he left the chamber for a brief exchange .\nRep. Jeff Van Drew plans to vote as a Democrat against impeachment\nRep. Jeff Van Drew , D-N.J. , told reporters an announcement on his party change was coming soon .\n`` I 'm thinking this through , how I want to announce it , \u201d he said . \u201c Then I \u2019 m going to announce whatever I do , and at that point in time , I will make a decision and make an announcement .\n`` We 'll see , '' he said when asked if he had requested a ceremony at the White House to switch parties .\nVan Drew said he would still be voting as a Democrat against impeachment today .\nIt was a clumsy way , a serious way to remove a president from office , and we should be careful , \u201d he said . \u201c Let \u2019 s just have an election . Let the people decide on this . \u201d\nRep. Barry Loudermilk , R-Ga. , upped the ante on Republicans \u2019 argument that the impeachment process has been unfair to Trump .\n\u201c One week before Christmas , I want you to keep this in mind , \u201d Loudermilk said during floor debate . \u201c Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president . \u201d\nSpecifically , Loudermilk said , Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers .\nThe House committees did n't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in the closed-door depositions or public hearings . The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings , but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined , calling the inquiry partisan and biased .\nKellyanne Conway , a special advisor to Trump speaking at the White House , said , `` I do n't like many Jesus comparisons because he is my Lord and Savior . ''\nTrump also compared the impeachment process to the Salem witch trials in a Tuesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .\n`` More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials , \u201d Trump complained in the six-page letter .\nSpeaking at a press conference , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , said he wanted the \u201c shortest trial possible \u201d for Trump .\nGraham , the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he would not support witnesses called by only one side .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to support witnesses being called for by the president , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m not going to support witnesses being called for by Senator Schumer , \u201d referring the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y .\nHe said he would invite Trump \u2019 s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to testify before his committee , adding , \u201c It \u2019 s just not good for your country to make these accusations on national television . \u201d\nGraham said he talked to the president and the First Lady today .\nWhen he asked Trump how he was doing , Graham said Trump replied , \u201c Well I \u2019 m being impeached . Other than that I \u2019 m doing okay . \u201d\nFlorida Rep. Francis Rooney , one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize President Donald Trump \u2019 s conduct concerning Ukraine , has decided not to support impeachment .\nThe congressman said he wanted the courts to rule first on the president 's claims of `` executive privilege '' preventing Congress from accessing documents and testimony before he could support impeachment .\n`` Having asked numerous ex-White House Counsels and well-known government attorneys , there can be no 'obstruction of Congress ( or of justice ) ' while the person refusing to comply is relying on a claim of executive privilege , '' Rooney said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon .\n\u201c Based on the limited evidence provided to the House of Representatives , the President \u2019 s behavior , while inappropriate , was neither criminal , nor does it rise to the level of justifying impeachment , '' he said .\nIn October , Rooney told CNN the situation was \u201c certainly very , very serious and troubling . I do n't think you can rule ( impeachment ) out until you know all the facts . ''\nThe next day , he told Fox News he would not seek a third term in 2020 , following a torrent of criticism from Republicans who view his willingness to question Trump \u2019 s conduct as tantamount to betrayal .\nRooney \u2019 s decision to oppose both articles of impeachment denies Democrats a chance to lure a House Republican to their side .\nIn the middle of impeachment debate on the House floor , Trump attacked Democrats and their effort to impeach him on Twitter .\n`` SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT , DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS . THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA , AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ! ! ! ! , '' he tweeted .\nThe president steadily tweeted and re-tweeted \u2013 mostly about impeachment \u2013 at least two dozen times by 1 p.m. EST\nTrump tweets : President calls impeachment accusations 'atrocious lies ' as House vote looms\nFive House members missed the vote on setting the rules for the impeachment debate , including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , one of the Democrats seeking the presidential nomination to take on Trump in 2020 .\nGabbard \u2019 s office didn \u2019 t immediately explain her absence . Gabbard hasn \u2019 t voted on the House floor since Dec. 11 and has missed more than one-third of floor votes this year .\nGabbard , who has declined to say whether she supports either article of impeachment , introduced a resolution Wednesday to censure Trump . ( A censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct , whereas impeachment could result in removal from office . )\nAmong the others who missed one of the day \u2019 s major votes , retiring Rep. Jose Serrano , D-N.Y. , has been absent due to illness ; Rep. Duncan Hunter , R-Calif. , was barred from voting after pleading guilty this month to campaign finance violations ; and retiring Rep. John Shimkus is visiting his son in Tanzania .\nWhile Rep. Ruben Gallego , D-Ariz. , missed the vote on approving the debate rules , he sided with his party minutes before in the procedural step calling for the vote .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201c solemnly and sadly \u201d opened the debate with a floor speech that drew on the nation \u2019 s founders and the reason they enshrined impeachment in the Constitution .\n\u201c Our founders \u2019 vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House , \u201d she said . \u201c If we do not act now , we would be derelict in our duty . It \u2019 s tragic the president \u2019 s reckless actions make impeachment necessary . He gave us no choice . \u201d\nPinned to the front of her dress was a replica of the mace of the House , the symbol of the chamber 's power that stands next to where the speaker sits on the dais .\nAs she spoke about the danger of foreign interference in U.S. elections , the speaker stood next to a white poster board of a fluttering American flag with the words : \u201c To the Republic for which it stands\u2026 \u201d\n\u201c Today , we are here to defend democracy for the people , \u201d she said . \u201c May god bless America . \u201d\nAs she finished , Democrats in the chamber applauded . Republicans did not .\nDemocratic lawmakers emptied out of the chamber after Pelosi 's speech , leaving mostly members of the House Judiciary Committee and their aides .\nLeading off the GOP rebuttal , Georgia Rep. Doug Collins said the Founding Fathers were concerned about a partisan impeachment process in which the majority could do what it wants .\nCollins dismissed the first article of impeachment \u2013 abuse of power \u2013 by saying Trump did nothing wrong . He described the second article \u2013 obstruction of Congress \u2013 as akin to petulant children saying they didn \u2019 t get what they wanted when they didn \u2019 t ask in the right way .\nFellow Republicans nodded as Collins said the GOP will take their case to American voters .\n\u201c It is a matter for the voters , not this House . Not in this way , \u201d Collins said . \u201c The people of America see through this . \u201d\nRep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah , said Democrats \u2019 objective with impeachment was not to help fulfill a Constitutional duty , but a move taken because they wanted Hillary Clinton to win the election .\n\u201c It \u2019 s shocking , I know , but it turns out some people don \u2019 t like President Trump , \u201d he said . \u201c Let \u2019 s be clear , this vote , this day has nothing to do with Ukraine . It has nothing to do with abuse of power . It has nothing to do with obstruction of Congress . \u201d\nStewart said Wednesday was about one thing : \u201c They hate this president , \u201d he said , adding , \u201c They think Hillary Clinton should be president . \u201d\nAfter his remarks , Nadler had a reminder for Stewart . \u201c If President Trump is impeached and removed , the new president will be Mike Pence , not Hillary Clinton , '' drawing laughs and cheers from Republicans on the House floor .\nAs debate on the impeachment articles got underway , Vice President Mike Pence began making the case to Michigan voters that will be amplified at Trump \u2019 s rally tonight in Battle Creek .\n`` Truthfully , friends , what 's happening on Capitol Hill today is a disgrace , \u201d Pence said at an event organized by the Trump campaign at a Sheraton in Saginaw . Dozens of rank-and-file union members were invited to attend by a Workers for Trump Coalition .\nA man holding an \u201c Impeach Trump \u201d sign stood alone at the hotel entrance when reporters traveling with the vice president arrived at the site . A small group of onlookers snapped photos of the Trump-Pence mega bus .\nInside the hotel , Pence said Democrats are trying to impeach Trump because they can \u2019 t defeat him .\nMichigan was one of the three \u201c blue wall \u201d states that fell to Trump in 2016 , assuring his victory .\nTrump will take the stage tonight around the time the House could be holding the final impeachment votes .\nAfter about an hour of discussion , the House voted 228 to 197 to set the rules for debating the two articles of impeachment against Trump . There will be up to six hours of debate with no amendments allowed .\nThe rules were approved after Democrats rejected Republicans '' attempts to block debate on the impeachment articles until certain conditions are met - including allowing Republicans to have their own impeachment hearing .\nLawmakers voted along party lines with the exception of the two Democrats who opposed the impeachment inquiry from the start : Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson and New Jersey Rep. Jefferson Van Drew , who is expected to switch parties .\nBefore the vote , Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole , the Rules Committee \u2019 s top Republican , gave a rare compliment in the intensely-partisan debate by thanking Chairman Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , for how he conducted Tuesday \u2019 s committee hearing on the rules package .\n\u201c Let me thank my friend for his kind words , \u201d McGovern responded , before likewise thanking Cole for his leadership .\nCole called the impeachment inquiry unfair , rushed , closed and a \u201c complete charade . \u201d\nMcGovern said that the central question is whether a president should be allowed to ask a foreign nation to interfere in an election .\n\u201c I ask my colleagues to search their souls before casting their votes , \u201d McGovern said .\nOutside the Capitol , a hearty crowd of about 200 demonstrators \u2013 bundled up in hats and scarves to brave the 33-degree winter day \u2013 waved homemade signs labeling Trump a \u201c criminal-in-chief \u201d and a \u201c fake president . \u201d\n\u201c What a beautiful day \u2026 A beautiful day for our democracy , \u201d declared Nathaly Arriola , executive director of Need to Impeach , whose mission is self-explanatory . The organization was founded and is funded by Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer .\n\u201c This has never been about the politics , \u201d she said . \u201c This has always been about the American people , and about protecting the democracy that allows us to live freely as Americans in this nation . \u201d\nBut she quickly pivoted to politics , declaring that her group would be delivering hand-held mirrors to vulnerable Republican senators \u2013 such as Colorado \u2019 s Cory Gardner and Maine \u2019 s Susan Collins \u2013 adorned with the message : \u201c Senator , how corrupt is too corrupt for you ? \u201d\nThe purpose of the mirrors was obvious , but she spelled it out for anyone who might need elaboration .\n\u201c Soon they will have to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves \u201d whether they convict or acquit Trump . A failure to convict , she said , would amount to a betrayal of the U.S. Constitution .\nMassachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern , the chairman of the House Rules Committee , introduced the rules for the debate , calling the proceedings a \u201c Democracy defining moment . \u201d\n\u201c We are being tested on something greater than our ability to toe the party line , \u201d McGovern said .\nDismissing as \u201c absurd \u201d the GOP charge that Democrats are trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election , McGovern said failing to rebuke Trump would set a dangerous precedent .\nOklahoma Rep. Tom Cole , the Rules Committee \u2019 s top Republican , countered that the premise of the impeachment articles is based on a \u201c pause of 55 days \u201d on military assistance to Ukraine . Cole argued there \u2019 s no evidence that the aid was a \u201c quid pro quo \u201d to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden .\n\u201c I oppose this limited and unfair process , \u201d Cole said , \u201c and I certainly oppose impeaching the president of the United States . \u201d\nRep. Donna Shalala , D-Fla. , who served as President Bill Clinton \u2019 s Health and Human Services Secretary , told reporters she found impeachment \u201c painful . \u201d\n\u201c None of us came here to impeach a president , \u201d she said .\nKaron Jahn , a 69-year-old retired professor from Alaska , took advantage of the auspicious timing of her family \u2019 s visit to the nation \u2019 s capital to give her two 14-year-old grandsons an up-close lesson in American democracy .\n\u201c We looked up the fact that it needs two-thirds vote in the Senate , \u201d Jahn said of the super-majority required for Trump to be convicted and removed from office . The boys are seeing \u201c in real time \u201d what they \u2019 ve already learned in school , she added .\nAsked if she supported Trump \u2019 s impeachment personally , she said yes , framing the argument more succinctly than most of the Democrats on the House floor : \u201c We did n't elect people to do the wrong thing . \u201d\nFor Lin Huang , a 31-year-old Chinese student studying computer engineering at Texas A & M University , the process was a bit more bewildering .\n\u201c We feel quite curious about this , \u201d he said as he waited in line to enter the public spectator \u2019 s gallery with his wife and in-laws . Huang said he was \u201c not quite sure \u201d what the impeachment debate was about , but he was eager to watch the proceedings anyway .\nAmanda Lopez and Travis Tilghman , who were visiting Washington from California , said they were thrilled their visit coincided with the House impeachment debate .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve both been binge watching the West Wing , so we \u2019 ve been looking at democracy again , \u201d said Lopez , a 31-year-old who works in the tech industry .\nAfter failing to stop the proceedings , House Republicans sought a vote on a resolution accusing the Democrats who led the impeachment inquiry of abusing their power .\nThe resolution included a litany of complaints against Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , who ran the impeachment hearings , and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , who oversaw debate over the impeachment articles .\nThe House voted 226 to 191 to block the resolution , Rep. Collin Peterson , D-Minn. , was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans .\nAn hour into the proceedings , the spectator galleries overlooking the floor were not full .\nOutside the Capitol , journalists with large cameras patrolled the entrances while a handful of protesters held signs , one reading , `` too much corruption to fit on one sign ! ''\nShortly after the House gaveled in , Republicans unsuccessfully tried to stop the proceedings .\nRep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , asked that the House adjourn `` so we can stop wasting America 's time for impeachment . ''\nThe motion was dismissed on a party-line vote of 226 to 188 .\nIt was just the first of many procedural votes Republicans could force throughout the all-day impeachment debate .\nA vote on both articles of impeachment is n't expected until later this evening .\n`` Help them , and help us all , '' House Chaplain Patrick Conroy said of House members when he opened the day 's session with a prayer .\nExpect a full House when the chamber convenes at 9 a.m .\nIn a letter to colleagues Tuesday night , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged everyone to `` join me on the floor . '' The letter also aims to set a tone of solemnity .\n`` Our constituents look to us to be respectful of the Constitution and Defenders of our Democracy and to proceed in a manner worthy of our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States , '' Pelosi wrote .\nIn other words , no cheering or clapping during the votes .\nTrump weighed in early with his usual mode of communication , a tweet .\n\u201c Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left , Do Nothing Democrats , AND I DID NOTHING WRONG ! \u201d he tweeted at 7:34 a.m .\nHouse Republicans signaled they are likely to press for a procedural vote even before the House officially begins debate on impeachment .\nAmong the first to arrive was Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , who took a seat behind the Democratic lectern , preparing to debate the rules for floor debate on the two articles of impeachment .\nTwo Judiciary Committee Democrats who sent the articles to the floor \u2013 Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Steve Cohen of Tennessee \u2013 grabbed front-row seats in the chamber , chatting .\nRep. Al Green , D-Texas , one of the earliest advocates of an impeachment inquiry , walked over to shake hands with Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C. , one of the president 's most vocal defenders .\nOn the day the House of Representatives was to debate and vote on articles of impeachment against Trump , Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii , introduced a resolution to censure him .\nA censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct , whereas impeachment could result in removal from office .\nThe resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee and is unlikely to get a vote in the House .\nThe introduction of the resolution comes as even most moderate Democrats in the House have announced their intention to vote for the articles of impeachment . Nearly a dozen House Democrats had floated censure as an option , as reported by Politico but have since backed away from it .\nGabbard has declined to say whether she will vote for either article of impeachment .\nRep. Diana DeGette , D-Colo. , will preside over much of the impeachment proceedings on the House floor Wednesday .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped the 12-term legislator from Denver for the prestigious task of what \u2019 s known as \u201c speaker pro tempore , \u201d which includes ruling on the points of order that guide floor debate .\n\u201c None of us came to Congress to impeach a president , but every one of us \u2013 when we assumed office \u2013 took an oath to uphold the constitution , \u201d DeGette said . \u201c This is a sad and somber moment in our nation \u2019 s history and the responsibility to preside over this important debate is something I will not take lightly . \u201d\nThe House will debate the articles for six hours and then vote separately on each of them , under parameters that the House Rules Committee recommended Tuesday . The rules for floor debate must still be adopted by the full House after an hour of debate Wednesday morning . If the House approves the articles , lawmakers will immediately take up a resolution naming managers who will serve essentially as prosecutors in the Senate trial , which is expected to begin in January .\nDemocrats hold a 233-197 majority in the House , with one independent and four vacancies , and the votes on the articles are expected to largely follow party lines . Republican leaders have said they expect all of their members to oppose impeachment .\nRep. Justin Amash , an independent from Michigan , is expected to vote with Democrats in favor of impeachment . One Democrat , Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey , announced he would vote against it and he might switch parties . Another Democrat , Rep.

Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii , Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Collin Peterson of Minnesota , have n't announced how they will vote .\nThe Judiciary Committee recommended by party-line vote the articles that accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival , former Vice President Joe Biden . The committee also accused Trump of obstructing their work by directing aides and agencies to defy congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony .\n`` He acted in a way that rises to the level of impeachment , '' said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern , D-Mass. , whose panel set the rules Tuesday for floor debate .\nBut Trump attacked the investigation Tuesday as an attempted partisan coup and urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , to call off the vote . Congressional Republicans called the Intelligence Committee investigation `` flawed '' and `` defective , '' in the words of Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma .\nThe three committees investigating Ukraine \u2013 Foreign Affairs , Intelligence , and Oversight and Reform \u2013 did n't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in their closed-door depositions or public hearings , but the time for Democratic and Republican questions was equally divided . The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings , but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined , calling the inquiry partisan and biased .\n\u201c The entire circus has been politically motivated from the very beginning , '' said Cole , the top Republican on the Rules Committee .\nIf the House approves one or both of the articles , the Senate will hold a trial to decide whether to convict Trump and remove him from office . A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required for removal , which is considered unlikely with Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the chamber .\nOnly two other presidents have faced Senate impeachment trials \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999 \u2013 and neither was removed from office .

    "content_original": "USA TODAY\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has become the third president in history to be impeached after the House voted to approve both articles of impeachment over his request of Ukraine to investigate political rivals.\n\nAfter a day of tense debate and fiery recriminations, the House voted largely along partisan lines, reshuffling American politics at time when voters are profoundly divided over the nation\u2019s leadership and direction.\n\nThe Democratic-led House approved both articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abusing his power by asking Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit his reelection and of obstructing Congress.\n\nAs the House voted, Trump rallied onstage in Michigan.\n\nEvery Democrat voted for the first article except Reps. Jefferson Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine joined Van Drew and Peterson as the only Democrats to vote against the second article, obstruction of Congress.\n\nEvery Republican voted against both articles. The House\u2019s lone independent, former Republican Justin Amash of Michigan, voted with the Democrats to impeach Trump on both charges.\n\nThe 230 votes to impeach Trump on the first article is slightly higher than the 228 votes that one of the articles against President Bill Clinton received in 1998.\n\nBut Republicans are gleeful about the fact that, unlike in 1998, no one on their side crossed party lines to vote to impeach one of their own.\n\n\"Every single Republican voted for us,\" Trump crowed at his rally. \u201cWe didn't lose one Republican vote.\"\n\nLawmakers are now voting on a second article, charging Trump with obstructing their investigation.\n\nThough the historic vote ended a hurried effort by Democrats to advance impeachment articles before the end of the year \u2013 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions less than three months ago \u2013 it will kick off an exceptionally rare trial in the Senate to determine whether the president will be removed from office.\n\nRepublican leaders expect that trial to begin in mid-January.\n\nThe White House responds\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the impeachment culminated in one of the most shameful episodes in history.\n\n\u201cThroughout the House Democrats\u2019 entire sham impeachment, the President was denied fundamental fairness and due process under the law,\u201d Grisham said in a statement. \u201cThe House blatantly ignored precedent and conducted the inquiry in secrecy behind closed doors so that Chairman Adam Schiff and his partisan political cronies could selectively leak information to their partners in the media to push a false narrative. \u201c\n\n\u201cThe President is confident the Senate will restore regular order, fairness, and due process, all of which were ignored in the House proceedings,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cHe is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated. President Trump will continue to work tirelessly to address the needs and priorities of the American people, as he has since the day he took office.\u201d\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nTulsi Gabbard voted 'present'\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, who voted present on both articles of impeachment, said she worked for the best interests of the country whether in the military or in Congress.\n\n\u201cAfter doing my due diligence in reviewing the 658-page impeachment report, I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,\u201d Gabbard said in a statement. \u201cI am standing in the center and have decided to vote Present. I could not in good conscience vote against impeachment because I believe President Trump is guilty of wrongdoing. I also could not in good conscience vote for impeachment because removal of a sitting President must not be the culmination of a partisan process, fueled by tribal animosities that have so gravely divided our country.\u201d\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nVoting with cards\n\nSome lawmakers used cards to vote, rather than recording their preference electronically as is usually the practice.\n\n\u201cThey want to actually write down their vote instead of doing it electronically on a vote of this gravity and significance,\u201d said Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass, who voted electronically.\n\nRepublicans rushed to grab the red cards, using a dais to scribble their names, state and district before waving them above their hands.\n\nRep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said the red and green cards were being used as \u201cmore of a demonstration\u201d to show the force behind the vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty lame, but it\u2019s what we got,\u201d King said of the demonstration.\n\n-Nicholas Wu, Christal Hayes\n\nClosing arguments\n\nThe debate drew to a close with final remarks from party leaders \u2013 some of which elicited immediate pushback from the other side.\n\nMinority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., drew groans from Democrats when he accused them of not only hating Trump, but also hating the 63 million Americans who voted for him. Republicans groaned back.\n\n\u201cIt is an abuse of power,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cIt\u2019s your abuse of power.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Trump was given every opportunity to prove his innocence.\n\n\u201cDemocrats did not choose this impeachment. We did not wish for it,\u201d he said. \"Oh, come on,\" several Republicans responded.\n\nLawmakers filled the House floor and most seats in the spectator gallery were taken when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., taunted his Democratic colleagues with something he said they hate to hear.\n\n\u201cDonald J. Trump is president of the United States,\u201d McCarthy said, eliciting a standing ovation from his GOP colleagues. \u201cHe\u2019s president today. He will be president tomorrow. And he will be president when this impeachment is over.\u201d\n\nThroughout Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s speech, he looked at Republicans, speaking directly to them as he implored for them to uphold the Constitution over their loyalty to the president.\n\n\u201cWhat is at risk here is the very idea of America,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans, in response, booed Schiff, some laughing or shouting things at him.\n\n-Maureen Groppe, Bart Jansen and Christal Hayes\n\nVoting begins\n\nAfter a full day of contentious debate and without a closing comment from Pelosi, the House began voting at 8:09pm on the first of two articles of impeachment: whether Trump committed an abuse of power by pressuring Ukraine to undertake investigations that would help him politically.\n\nDemocrats are expected to have the 216 votes needed to pass the article. All Republicans are expected to oppose it.\n\nThe chamber is full enough many lawmakers and staffers from both parties are standing in the back of their respective sides.\n\nSome of the moderate Democrats who have the most at stake politically and who helped tipped Pelosi\u2019s hand on beginning the impeachment inquiry entered the chamber together shortly before the voting began.\n\n\u201cSee you on the other end,\u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who represents a district Trump won in 2016.\n\nOne Democrat, freshman Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, has said he will vote for the first article but not for the second, which charges Trump with obstructing Congress in its investigation.\u201cWe have bipartisan opposition to impeachment, not bipartisan support,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.\n\nTrump onstage in Michigan\n\nTrump struck an upbeat tone after arriving in Battle Creek for a rally as the House neared conclusion of the impeachment debate.\n\n\u201cDoing good,\u201d he said to shouted questions from reporters as he deplaned from Air Force One and climbed into his limousine.\n\nAbout 150 people who\u2019d braved Michigan\u2019s below-freezing temperatures to wait for Trump\u2019s arrival cheered him on.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nThe `Schiff show\u2019\n\nAfter calling impeachment an embarrassment for House Democrats, Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., laid into House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nZeldin repeated GOP complaints about the way Schiff handled the impeachment inquiry, concluding: \u201cIt\u2019s a total Schiff show.\u201d\n\nZeldin is not the first Republican to use that wordplay on Schiff\u2019s last name.\n\nIn November, Trump was even more explicit when he tweeted: \u201cGee, Pelosi & Schitt have a good idea, \u2018lets Impeach the President.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor his part, Schiff smiled as he returned to the microphone after Zeldin's remarks.\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe\n\nFrom a 'perfect' call to a party switch:How we got to the impeachment of Donald Trump\n\nRepublicans boo Adam Schiff\n\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tried to rebut the Republican argument that there's no impeachable offense because Ukraine eventually received the delayed military funds.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues continue to make the argument that the Ukrainians got the money,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cYes, the president got caught but they got the money, no harm, no foul. It\u2019s the equivalent of saying, `If you\u2019re pulled over by a cop and you attempt to bribe the cop, and the cop doesn\u2019t take the money but arrests you, where\u2019s the crime in that?'\u201d\n\nSchiff's comments drew booing from the Republican side of the chamber.\n\n\u2013 Nicholas Wu\n\nA former Republican speaks\n\nMichigan Rep. Justin Amash, an independent who left the Republican Party last summer, was welcomed on the Democratic side of the House with pats on the shoulder and handshakes from smiling colleagues after saying he would vote to impeach Trump.\n\n\u201cHis actions reflect precisely the type of conduct the framers of the Constitution intended to remedy through the power of impeachment,\u201d Amash said.\n\nHe was the only Republican in the House to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election and its aftermath earlier this year.\n\nAmash said Wednesday that Trump abused and violated the public trust by soliciting the aid of a foreign power for his own personal and political gain.\n\nHe told USA TODAY after his floor remarks that he might have been able to convince his former Republican colleagues to vote for impeachment earlier in the process. But, Amash added, \u201cThe deeper we\u2019ve gotten into it, the more people feel like they have to stick with their team, if you will, to survive.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats have approached Amash about helping present the case against Trump when the proceedings move to the Senate.\n\nAsked if he\u2019s interested in being an impeachment manager, Amash replied: \u201cI\u2019m happy to have a conversation with the speaker.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Maureen Groppe, Bart Jansen and Nicholas Wu\n\nSchiff: \u2018A chance to cheat in the next election\u2019\n\nWhile House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been the Democrats\u2019 face of impeachment, Adam Schiff has been the workhorse of the effort.\n\nAs chair of the House Intelligence Committee, the California Democrat led the sharp questioning of key witnesses that laid out Trump\u2019s role in Ukraine. And he has been able to succinctly articulate the complexities of the committee\u2019s findings to the public.\n\nHalfway through Wednesday\u2019s floor debate, Schiff stepped up to the dais to summarize the testimony and characterize the president as someone consumed by personal advancement.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about Ukraine or the impact on our national security caused by withholding military aid to that country fighting for its democratic life,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that matters to this president is what affects him personally: an investigation into his political rival and a chance to cheat in the next election.\u201d\n\nLater, Schiff turned to his GOP colleagues and chided them for choosing party over country.\n\n\u201cMany of my colleagues appear to have made their choice to protect the president, to enable him to be above the law, to empower this president to cheat again as long as it is in the service of their party and their power,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have made their choice and I believe they will rue the day that they did.\u201d\n\nGetting testy\n\nOne of the most fiery exchanges came after Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, accused Democrats of using impeachment to stop an investigation into Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDemocrats have noted that U.S. intelligence services found that Russia meddled in the election and FBI Director Christopher Wray told ABC News that there is \u201cno information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election.\u201d\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said it was \u201cdeeply concerned that any member of the House would spout Russian propaganda on the floor of the House.\u201d\n\nRussia has blamed Ukraine for its own interference in the election.\n\nGohmert, who was still at his lectern, pointed at Nadler and said he should get a chance to respond, but he wasn't recognized.\n\n\"He calls me guilty of Russian propaganda,\" Gohmert shouted over the pounding of the gavel. Gohmert walked past Nadler as he left the chamber for a brief exchange.\n\n\u2013 Bart Jansen\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew plans to vote as a Democrat against impeachment\n\nRep. Jeff Van Drew, D-N.J., told reporters an announcement on his party change was coming soon.\n\n\"I'm thinking this through, how I want to announce it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to announce whatever I do, and at that point in time, I will make a decision and make an announcement.\n\n\"We'll see,\" he said when asked if he had requested a ceremony at the White House to switch parties.\n\nVan Drew said he would still be voting as a Democrat against impeachment today.\n\nIt was a clumsy way, a serious way to remove a president from office, and we should be careful,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just have an election. Let the people decide on this.\u201d\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nRepublican: Crucifixion of Christ was fairer\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., upped the ante on Republicans\u2019 argument that the impeachment process has been unfair to Trump.\n\n\u201cOne week before Christmas, I want you to keep this in mind,\u201d Loudermilk said during floor debate. \u201cPontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Loudermilk said, Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers.\n\nThe House committees didn't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in the closed-door depositions or public hearings. The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings, but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined, calling the inquiry partisan and biased.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a special advisor to Trump speaking at the White House, said, \"I don't like many Jesus comparisons because he is my Lord and Savior.\"\n\nTrump also compared the impeachment process to the Salem witch trials in a Tuesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\"More due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials,\u201d Trump complained in the six-page letter.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nGraham wants 'shortest trial possible' in Senate\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wanted the \u201cshortest trial possible\u201d for Trump.\n\nGraham, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would not support witnesses called by only one side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to support witnesses being called for by the president,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to support witnesses being called for by Senator Schumer,\u201d referring the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nHe said he would invite Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to testify before his committee, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just not good for your country to make these accusations on national television.\u201d\n\nGraham said he talked to the president and the First Lady today.\n\nWhen he asked Trump how he was doing, Graham said Trump replied, \u201cWell I\u2019m being impeached. Other than that I\u2019m doing okay.\u201d\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nGOP critic of Trump to oppose impeachment\n\nFlorida Rep. Francis Rooney, one of the few Republicans to publicly criticize President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct concerning Ukraine, has decided not to support impeachment.\n\nThe congressman said he wanted the courts to rule first on the president's claims of \"executive privilege\" preventing Congress from accessing documents and testimony before he could support impeachment.\n\n\"Having asked numerous ex-White House Counsels and well-known government attorneys, there can be no 'obstruction of Congress (or of justice)' while the person refusing to comply is relying on a claim of executive privilege,\" Rooney said in a statement released Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cBased on the limited evidence provided to the House of Representatives, the President\u2019s behavior, while inappropriate, was neither criminal, nor does it rise to the level of justifying impeachment,\" he said.\n\nIn October, Rooney told CNN the situation was \u201ccertainly very, very serious and troubling. I don't think you can rule (impeachment) out until you know all the facts.\"\n\nThe next day, he told Fox News he would not seek a third term in 2020, following a torrent of criticism from Republicans who view his willingness to question Trump\u2019s conduct as tantamount to betrayal.\n\nRooney\u2019s decision to oppose both articles of impeachment denies Democrats a chance to lure a House Republican to their side.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nTrump calls impeachment 'assault on America'\n\nIn the middle of impeachment debate on the House floor, Trump attacked Democrats and their effort to impeach him on Twitter.\n\n\"SUCH ATROCIOUS LIES BY THE RADICAL LEFT, DO NOTHING DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN ASSAULT ON AMERICA, AND AN ASSAULT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!!!,\" he tweeted.\n\nThe president steadily tweeted and re-tweeted \u2013 mostly about impeachment \u2013 at least two dozen times by 1 p.m. EST\n\n- Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump tweets:President calls impeachment accusations 'atrocious lies' as House vote looms\n\nTulsi Gabbard, others miss rules vote\n\nFive House members missed the vote on setting the rules for the impeachment debate, including Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, one of the Democrats seeking the presidential nomination to take on Trump in 2020.\n\nGabbard\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately explain her absence. Gabbard hasn\u2019t voted on the House floor since Dec. 11 and has missed more than one-third of floor votes this year.\n\nGabbard, who has declined to say whether she supports either article of impeachment, introduced a resolution Wednesday to censure Trump. (A censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct, whereas impeachment could result in removal from office.)\n\nAmong the others who missed one of the day\u2019s major votes, retiring Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., has been absent due to illness; Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., was barred from voting after pleading guilty this month to campaign finance violations; and retiring Rep. John Shimkus is visiting his son in Tanzania.\n\nWhile Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., missed the vote on approving the debate rules, he sided with his party minutes before in the procedural step calling for the vote.\n\n- Maureen Groppe and Nicholas Wu\n\nPelosi: 'He gave us no choice'\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201csolemnly and sadly\u201d opened the debate with a floor speech that drew on the nation\u2019s founders and the reason they enshrined impeachment in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cOur founders\u2019 vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It\u2019s tragic the president\u2019s reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.\u201d\n\nPinned to the front of her dress was a replica of the mace of the House, the symbol of the chamber's power that stands next to where the speaker sits on the dais.\n\nAs she spoke about the danger of foreign interference in U.S. elections, the speaker stood next to a white poster board of a fluttering American flag with the words: \u201cTo the Republic for which it stands\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we are here to defend democracy for the people,\u201d she said. \u201cMay god bless America.\u201d\n\nAs she finished, Democrats in the chamber applauded. Republicans did not.\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nCollins: The people 'see through this'\n\nDemocratic lawmakers emptied out of the chamber after Pelosi's speech, leaving mostly members of the House Judiciary Committee and their aides.\n\nLeading off the GOP rebuttal, Georgia Rep. Doug Collins said the Founding Fathers were concerned about a partisan impeachment process in which the majority could do what it wants.\n\nCollins dismissed the first article of impeachment \u2013 abuse of power \u2013 by saying Trump did nothing wrong. He described the second article \u2013 obstruction of Congress \u2013 as akin to petulant children saying they didn\u2019t get what they wanted when they didn\u2019t ask in the right way.\n\nFellow Republicans nodded as Collins said the GOP will take their case to American voters.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter for the voters, not this House. Not in this way,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe people of America see through this.\u201d\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nStewart: 'They hate this president'\n\nRep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said Democrats\u2019 objective with impeachment was not to help fulfill a Constitutional duty, but a move taken because they wanted Hillary Clinton to win the election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking, I know, but it turns out some people don\u2019t like President Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, this vote, this day has nothing to do with Ukraine. It has nothing to do with abuse of power. It has nothing to do with obstruction of Congress.\u201d\n\nStewart said Wednesday was about one thing: \u201cThey hate this president,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey think Hillary Clinton should be president.\u201d\n\nAfter his remarks, Nadler had a reminder for Stewart. \u201cIf President Trump is impeached and removed, the new president will be Mike Pence, not Hillary Clinton,\" drawing laughs and cheers from Republicans on the House floor.\n\nIn Michigan, Pence pushes back\n\nAs debate on the impeachment articles got underway, Vice President Mike Pence began making the case to Michigan voters that will be amplified at Trump\u2019s rally tonight in Battle Creek.\n\n\"Truthfully, friends, what's happening on Capitol Hill today is a disgrace,\u201d Pence said at an event organized by the Trump campaign at a Sheraton in Saginaw. Dozens of rank-and-file union members were invited to attend by a Workers for Trump Coalition.\n\nA man holding an \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d sign stood alone at the hotel entrance when reporters traveling with the vice president arrived at the site. A small group of onlookers snapped photos of the Trump-Pence mega bus.\n\nInside the hotel, Pence said Democrats are trying to impeach Trump because they can\u2019t defeat him.\n\nMichigan was one of the three \u201cblue wall\u201d states that fell to Trump in 2016, assuring his victory.\n\nTrump will take the stage tonight around the time the House could be holding the final impeachment votes.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHouse approves impeachment debate rules\n\nAfter about an hour of discussion, the House voted 228 to 197 to set the rules for debating the two articles of impeachment against Trump. There will be up to six hours of debate with no amendments allowed.\n\nThe rules were approved after Democrats rejected Republicans'' attempts to block debate on the impeachment articles until certain conditions are met - including allowing Republicans to have their own impeachment hearing.\n\nLawmakers voted along party lines with the exception of the two Democrats who opposed the impeachment inquiry from the start: Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson and New Jersey Rep. Jefferson Van Drew, who is expected to switch parties.\n\nBefore the vote, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the Rules Committee\u2019s top Republican, gave a rare compliment in the intensely-partisan debate by thanking Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., for how he conducted Tuesday\u2019s committee hearing on the rules package.\n\n\u201cLet me thank my friend for his kind words,\u201d McGovern responded, before likewise thanking Cole for his leadership.\n\nBut there the friendliness ended.\n\nCole called the impeachment inquiry unfair, rushed, closed and a \u201ccomplete charade.\u201d\n\nMcGovern said that the central question is whether a president should be allowed to ask a foreign nation to interfere in an election.\n\n\u201cI ask my colleagues to search their souls before casting their votes,\u201d McGovern said.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nProtesters descend on Capitol\n\nOutside the Capitol, a hearty crowd of about 200 demonstrators \u2013 bundled up in hats and scarves to brave the 33-degree winter day \u2013 waved homemade signs labeling Trump a \u201ccriminal-in-chief\u201d and a \u201cfake president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a beautiful day \u2026 A beautiful day for our democracy,\u201d declared Nathaly Arriola, executive director of Need to Impeach, whose mission is self-explanatory. The organization was founded and is funded by Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer.\n\n\u201cThis has never been about the politics,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has always been about the American people, and about protecting the democracy that allows us to live freely as Americans in this nation.\u201d\n\nBut she quickly pivoted to politics, declaring that her group would be delivering hand-held mirrors to vulnerable Republican senators \u2013 such as Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner and Maine\u2019s Susan Collins \u2013 adorned with the message: \u201cSenator, how corrupt is too corrupt for you?\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the mirrors was obvious, but she spelled it out for anyone who might need elaboration.\n\n\u201cSoon they will have to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves\u201d whether they convict or acquit Trump. A failure to convict, she said, would amount to a betrayal of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cAnd Americans will hold them accountable,\u201d she added.\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nDebate begins on how to proceed\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, introduced the rules for the debate, calling the proceedings a \u201cDemocracy defining moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are being tested on something greater than our ability to toe the party line,\u201d McGovern said.\n\nDismissing as \u201cabsurd\u201d the GOP charge that Democrats are trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election, McGovern said failing to rebuke Trump would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nOklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the Rules Committee\u2019s top Republican, countered that the premise of the impeachment articles is based on a \u201cpause of 55 days\u201d on military assistance to Ukraine. Cole argued there\u2019s no evidence that the aid was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cI oppose this limited and unfair process,\u201d Cole said, \u201cand I certainly oppose impeaching the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nRep. Donna Shalala, D-Fla., who served as President Bill Clinton\u2019s Health and Human Services Secretary, told reporters she found impeachment \u201cpainful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us came here to impeach a president,\u201d she said.\n\n- Maureen Groppe and Nicholas Wu\n\nTourists there to witness debate\n\nKaron Jahn, a 69-year-old retired professor from Alaska, took advantage of the auspicious timing of her family\u2019s visit to the nation\u2019s capital to give her two 14-year-old grandsons an up-close lesson in American democracy.\n\n\u201cWe looked up the fact that it needs two-thirds vote in the Senate,\u201d Jahn said of the super-majority required for Trump to be convicted and removed from office. The boys are seeing \u201cin real time\u201d what they\u2019ve already learned in school, she added.\n\nAsked if she supported Trump\u2019s impeachment personally, she said yes, framing the argument more succinctly than most of the Democrats on the House floor: \u201cWe didn't elect people to do the wrong thing.\u201d\n\nFor Lin Huang, a 31-year-old Chinese student studying computer engineering at Texas A&M University, the process was a bit more bewildering.\n\n\u201cWe feel quite curious about this,\u201d he said as he waited in line to enter the public spectator\u2019s gallery with his wife and in-laws. Huang said he was \u201cnot quite sure\u201d what the impeachment debate was about, but he was eager to watch the proceedings anyway.\n\nAmanda Lopez and Travis Tilghman, who were visiting Washington from California, said they were thrilled their visit coincided with the House impeachment debate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve both been binge watching the West Wing, so we\u2019ve been looking at democracy again,\u201d said Lopez, a 31-year-old who works in the tech industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s corrupt,\u201d said Tilghman, 35\n\nAnother GOP protest fails\n\nAfter failing to stop the proceedings, House Republicans sought a vote on a resolution accusing the Democrats who led the impeachment inquiry of abusing their power.\n\nThe resolution included a litany of complaints against Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who ran the impeachment hearings, and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who oversaw debate over the impeachment articles.\n\nThe House voted 226 to 191 to block the resolution, Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn., was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans.\n\nAn hour into the proceedings, the spectator galleries overlooking the floor were not full.\n\nOutside the Capitol, journalists with large cameras patrolled the entrances while a handful of protesters held signs, one reading, \"too much corruption to fit on one sign!\"\n\n- Maureen Groppe, Bart Jansen and Christal Hayes\n\nGOP motion to adjourn fails\n\nShortly after the House gaveled in, Republicans unsuccessfully tried to stop the proceedings.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., asked that the House adjourn \"so we can stop wasting America's time for impeachment.\"\n\nThe motion was dismissed on a party-line vote of 226 to 188.\n\nIt was just the first of many procedural votes Republicans could force throughout the all-day impeachment debate.\n\nA vote on both articles of impeachment isn't expected until later this evening.\n\n\"Help them, and help us all,\" House Chaplain Patrick Conroy said of House members when he opened the day's session with a prayer.\n\n- Maureen Groppe, Christal Hayes and Michael Collins\n\nPelosi: 'Join me on the floor'\n\nExpect a full House when the chamber convenes at 9 a.m.\n\nIn a letter to colleagues Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged everyone to \"join me on the floor.\" The letter also aims to set a tone of solemnity.\n\n\"Our constituents look to us to be respectful of the Constitution and Defenders of our Democracy and to proceed in a manner worthy of our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" Pelosi wrote.\n\nIn other words, no cheering or clapping during the votes.\n\nTrump weighed in early with his usual mode of communication, a tweet.\n\n\u201cCan you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG!\u201d he tweeted at 7:34 a.m.\n\nHouse Republicans signaled they are likely to press for a procedural vote even before the House officially begins debate on impeachment.\n\nAmong the first to arrive was Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who took a seat behind the Democratic lectern, preparing to debate the rules for floor debate on the two articles of impeachment.\n\nTwo Judiciary Committee Democrats who sent the articles to the floor \u2013 Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Steve Cohen of Tennessee \u2013 grabbed front-row seats in the chamber, chatting.\n\nRep. Al Green, D-Texas, one of the earliest advocates of an impeachment inquiry, walked over to shake hands with Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., one of the president's most vocal defenders.\n\n- Maureen Groppe and Bart Jansen\n\nTulsi Gabbard introduces censure resolution\n\nOn the day the House of Representatives was to debate and vote on articles of impeachment against Trump, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, introduced a resolution to censure him.\n\nA censure resolution expresses strong disapproval of conduct, whereas impeachment could result in removal from office.\n\nThe resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee and is unlikely to get a vote in the House.\n\nThe introduction of the resolution comes as even most moderate Democrats in the House have announced their intention to vote for the articles of impeachment. Nearly a dozen House Democrats had floated censure as an option, as reported by Politico but have since backed away from it.\n\nGabbard has declined to say whether she will vote for either article of impeachment.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nColorado lawmaker to preside over floor debate\n\nRep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., will preside over much of the impeachment proceedings on the House floor Wednesday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped the 12-term legislator from Denver for the prestigious task of what\u2019s known as \u201cspeaker pro tempore,\u201d which includes ruling on the points of order that guide floor debate.\n\n\u201cNone of us came to Congress to impeach a president, but every one of us \u2013 when we assumed office \u2013 took an oath to uphold the constitution,\u201d DeGette said. \u201cThis is a sad and somber moment in our nation\u2019s history and the responsibility to preside over this important debate is something I will not take lightly.\u201d\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nHow the vote will happen\n\nThe House will debate the articles for six hours and then vote separately on each of them, under parameters that the House Rules Committee recommended Tuesday. The rules for floor debate must still be adopted by the full House after an hour of debate Wednesday morning. If the House approves the articles, lawmakers will immediately take up a resolution naming managers who will serve essentially as prosecutors in the Senate trial, which is expected to begin in January.\n\nDemocrats hold a 233-197 majority in the House, with one independent and four vacancies, and the votes on the articles are expected to largely follow party lines. Republican leaders have said they expect all of their members to oppose impeachment.\n\nRep. Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan, is expected to vote with Democrats in favor of impeachment. One Democrat, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, announced he would vote against it and he might switch parties. Another Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, told the Bangor Daily News he would support impeachment for abuse of power, but not obstruction of Congress. And a few Democrats, including Reps. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Collin Peterson of Minnesota, haven't announced how they will vote.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee recommended by party-line vote the articles that accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The committee also accused Trump of obstructing their work by directing aides and agencies to defy congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony.\n\n\"He acted in a way that rises to the level of impeachment,\" said House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., whose panel set the rules Tuesday for floor debate.\n\nBut Trump attacked the investigation Tuesday as an attempted partisan coup and urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to call off the vote. Congressional Republicans called the Intelligence Committee investigation \"flawed\" and \"defective,\" in the words of Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma.\n\nThe three committees investigating Ukraine \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 didn't allow Trump or his representatives to participate in their closed-door depositions or public hearings, but the time for Democratic and Republican questions was equally divided. The Judiciary Committee invited Trump to participate in its hearings, but White House counsel Pat Cipollone declined, calling the inquiry partisan and biased.\n\n\u201cThe entire circus has been politically motivated from the very beginning,\" said Cole, the top Republican on the Rules Committee.\n\nIf the House approves one or both of the articles, the Senate will hold a trial to decide whether to convict Trump and remove him from office. A two-thirds majority of the Senate is required for removal, which is considered unlikely with Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the chamber.\n\nOnly two other presidents have faced Senate impeachment trials \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999 \u2013 and neither was removed from office. Former President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before a House vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nAnti-impeachment ad blitz:Donald Trump's allies target Democrats in swing districts\n\nTrump sent Pelosi a six-page letter expressing his \u201cmost powerful protest against the partisan impeachment crusade\u201d and urging her not to hold a vote on \"this impeachment fantasy.\"\n\n\u201cThis impeachment represents an unprecedented and unconstitutional abuse of power by Democrat Lawmakers, unequaled in nearly two and a half centuries of American legislative history,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president said more due process was provided during the Salem witch trials than during this inquiry, which he called \u201cnothing more than an illegal, partisan attempted coup.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey include no crimes, no misdemeanors, and no offenses whatsoever,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who presented the Judiciary Committee's report to the Rules Committee, said the investigation by the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform panels gathered overwhelming evidence against Trump from thousands of pages of documents and 100 hours of depositions with 17 sworn witnesses.\n\n\"These articles charge that President Trump has engaged in systematic abuse of his powers, obstructed Congress, and realized the worst fears of the Framers by subordinating our national security and dragging foreign powers into American politics to corrupt our elections, all for the greater cause of his own personal gain and ambition,\" Raskin said.\n\nUSA TODAY Poll:Impeached or not, Trump leads his Democratic rivals for another term",
