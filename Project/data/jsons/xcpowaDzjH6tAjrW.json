    "content": "America \u2019 s newest federal agency , charged with regulating financial institutions to prevent another hostile economic downturn , is having troubles regulating hostilities and discrimination among its own employees .\nEvidence gathered by congressional investigators , internal agency documents and \u2588\u2588\u2588 interviews with workers discloses scores of cases of U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau employees seeking protection from racially offensive , sexist or discriminatory behavior , including that :\n\u2022 A naturalized U.S. citizen , with more than a decade of service with the U.S. government , was called an \u201c f \u2019 ing foreigner \u201d by management .\n\u2022 A department was internally dubbed \u201c the Plantation \u201d because of the number of blacks working in it \u2014 all supervised by white managers \u2014 without any obvious promotional track or way to get transferred .\n\u2022 White employees were twice as likely to get the most favorable personnel ratings in employee reviews , as were minorities .\n\u2022 Managers intimidated and retaliated against employees for voicing complaints or offering an alternative point of view \u2014 from denying vacation requests to hiring unqualified friends to supervise jobs and then asking subordinates to train them .\nEvidence of discriminatory pay practices in the agency \u2019 s own statistics have even resulted in promises by management of emergency pay raises for minority workers to create more parity , the documents show .\nIt \u2019 s not the storyline that America \u2019 s newest federal agency wanted at its inception .\nCFPB , the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , was created by then-Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and then-Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts .\nThe latter two Democrats pushed through legislation in Congress named after them that created the agency to protect consumers from predatory banks and lending institutions blamed for the 2007-2009 financial crisis . And Ms. Warren , now considered by some as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 , became its first leader .\nSince then , the agency has been a political football , roundly opposed by Republicans as an excessive regulatory power play and embraced by liberals who saw it as a necessary fix to a financial system gone awry .\nAway from the political fray on Capitol Hill , dozens of workers at the CFPB say the bureau \u2019 s lack of accountability is enabling managers to create their own minifiefdoms , stock the ranks with inexperienced and unqualified friends and retaliate against anybody who disagrees with their agenda .\nThe House Committee on Financial Services began airing some of the problems at hearings earlier this spring , bringing to light a situation that has simmered for months out of public view .\nCFPB acknowledges its employees \u2019 complaints about a hostile working environment and says it is working with the National Treasury Employees Union \u2014 which represents CFPB employees \u2014 to settle worker protests and iron out new performance reviews , which are at the heart of many of the protests .\nThe agency \u2019 s director , Richard Cordray , testified last month it has been challenging to create an agency from the ground up over the last three years , and working conditions for some have been \u201c especially difficult . \u201d\n\u201c I am committed to ensuring that all Bureau employees are treated fairly and that they receive the respect and dignity they deserve , \u201d Mr. Cordray told the House Financial Services \u2019 Oversight and Investigations subcommittee on July 30 .\nStill , current CFBP employees say more work needs to be done and that some thought Mr. Cordray \u2019 s testimony to be both impenitent and out of touch with what \u2019 s actually happening at the bureau .\n\u201c Anybody who asks questions or doesn \u2019 t just take orders gets discriminated against , \u201d Ali Naraghi , a bank examiner in the CFPB \u2019 s southeast region , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview . \u201c What CFPB does internally to its staff is contrary to all of their objectives and the mission of the agency . \u201d\nMr. Naraghi , a naturalized citizen of Persian descent , alleges he was called a \u201c f \u2019 ing foreigner \u201d by his superiors because he vocalized discrepancies in the way the CFPB was conducting its bank examinations compared with the way it was done at the Federal Reserve , where Mr. Naraghi served for 14 years .\nAs a bank examiner , Mr. Naraghi holds a top government position , drawing in a salary of more than $ 100,000 . He and other examiners essentially audit private banks for compliance with federal law .\nAt the Federal Reserve , Mr. Naraghi earned top performance marks and promotions \u2014 winning an excellence award for mortgage servicing . At the CFPB he \u2019 s been graded at the lowest level in his performance reviews and has remained stagnant in his position since he started at the agency in 2011 .\nNewly in his position , Mr. Naraghi raised concerns to management that the CFPB wasn \u2019 t using a risk model \u2014 a uniform institutionalized measuring stick \u2014 to evaluate banks \u2019 performance against one another . Because of this , he felt many examinations were skewed either in favor of what the institution dictated or to the examiner \u2019 s own preconceived notions .\nWhat the examinations weren \u2019 t \u2014 he pointed out both to his manager and later to Congress in testimony \u2014 were objective .\n\u201c The only thing consistent within the CFPB is that it \u2019 s inconsistent , \u201d said Mr. Naraghi , who still holds his position as he works out his complaint with the agency . \u201c They want us to be like a private that salutes the major and does whatever they say \u2014 but everybody has something to add . \u201d\nHe said he wasn \u2019 t trying to criticize the way CFPB was conducting its investigations , only voicing ways to make them better . His manager didn \u2019 t view it that way .\nAfter being subpoenaed by the congressional committee to testify in June , the agency tried to silence Mr. Naraghi by demanding lawmakers strike or bar his opening statement . The effort failed .\nIn his opening testimony , Mr. Naraghi said the very employee relations office that is supposed to help aggrieved employees was \u201c broken and is more harmful than helpful to employees who suffer discrimination or retaliation . \u201d\nIn response , CFPB spokeswoman Jen Howard said , on average , CFPB employees are more satisfied with their management compared with other government agencies .\nAccording to a survey taken by CFPB and released to The Times , 72 percent of CFPB employees say they have a \u201c high level of respect for my organization \u2019 s senior leaders , \u201d compared to 54 percent governmentwide .\nSeventy-five percent of CFPB employees either agree or strongly agree that \u201c My supervisor/team leader is committed to a workforce representative of all segments of society , \u201d compared with 64 percent governmentwide , the agency said .\nDespite his discrimination complaint , Mr. Naraghi doesn \u2019 t question CFPB \u2019 s mission \u2014 he very much stands up for the agency and the work it is doing . He sought employment at the CFPB after listening to Ms. Warren , the agency \u2019 s first head and now a U.S. senator , describe the agency \u2019 s goals of protecting consumers when she was pushing for it as a university professor .\n\u201c My in-laws in Mississippi had been taken advantage of by a fly-by-night mortgage company , \u201d said Mr. Naraghi . \u201c I believe in our mission . That \u2019 s why I came . We can do a lot of good , but breaking the law to enforce the law isn \u2019 t cool in my opinion . \u201d\nPart of the concern is CFPB \u2019 s treatment of minorities , women and workers over the age of 40 , Mr. Naraghi and other unnamed employees said . Also , the divide between management and the bargaining unit is vast , leaving those outside the higher ranks feeling helpless and without recourse .\nLast year , within the CFPB , white employees were twice as likely to receive the highest rating at the bureau as compared to black or Hispanic employees , according to the CFPB \u2019 s own performance management reviews , which were requested and made public by the union NTEU .\nThe odds were similarly stacked against workers over the age of 40 , said Ben Konop , executive vice president at the NTEU in his May testimony to the committee .\n\u201c And ratings continued to be badly skewed in favor of management when compared with the ratings of the bargaining unit , who do the bulk of the work at the bureau , \u201d Mr. Konop said .\nIn 2013 CFPB employees filed 115 official grievances through the union \u2014 a particularly high amount for an agency with only 1,300 employees .\nComplaints range from managers denying vacation requests in retaliation for comments they don \u2019 t like to dismissing internal requests for promotions and hiring unqualified friends instead who then needed training and supervision from those in lesser positions , according to current employees .\nSome of these complaints were addressed by management at CFPB \u2019 s \u201c All Hands \u201d spring meeting \u2014 an agencywide conference that is used for training and team building .\nIn a presentation obtained from the conference by The Times , internal management laid bare the discrepancies in pay and performance between minorities and their white counterparts and committed to compensate employees for the difference .\n\u201c In the absence of a definitive root cause , we have decided to compensate employees to remediate statistical disparities caused by our prior performance management system and to bargain with NTEU to change it going forward , \u201d the presentation said .\nThe NTEU , for its part , will continue its effort to uncover and eliminate any unfair treatment at the bureau , NTEU National President Colleen M. Kelley said in a statement to The Times .\n\u201c Since NTEU began representing CFPB employees , we raised and pressed management on addressing employee concerns about disparate treatment and other workplace issues through collective bargaining and the grievance process , \u201d Ms. Kelley said .\nLast month , improvements were made in the agency \u2019 s telework policy , employee relocation policy and career ladder positions , Ms. Kelley said . The agency has also agreed to move away from its current performance system and form a task force that will focus on redesigning it , she said .\nAgency employees say the pay increases are just restitution , but because almost everyone got bonuses and promotions , it just raised the playing field instead of equalizing it .\nIn addition , high-level employees \u2014 such as examiners with pay grades above a certain threshold \u2014 were exempt from the pay increases . In terms of the redesigned performance reviews , the true test will be in the coming months and years , employees said .\nWhat angers them the most , however , is the fact that many managers who have a history of employee complaints and discrimination are still holding their jobs and , in some cases , intimidating others not to come forward , according to multiple employees , some of whom only spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation .\nAngela Martin , a senior CFPB enforcement attorney , accused a supervisor of retaliating against her after she filed a workers complaint with human resources .\nMrs. Martin alleges her supervisor threatened to bring counterclaims against her if she went forward with her complaint , then isolated her , diminished her job duties and held her accountable for work while preventing her from being involved in the preparation of that work .\nMrs. Martin \u2014 who solidly believes in the agency \u2019 s mission \u2014 was a former private practice attorney and Army veteran who specialized in representing military families in consumer fraud cases .\n\u201c Employees have told me of alarming stories of maltreatment that resulted when they opposed the mismanagement and when they asserted their individual rights , \u201d Mrs. Martin , a mother of five , told Congress in April . \u201c Certain managers have adopted an authoritarian , untouchable , unaccountable and unanswerable management style . \u201d\nAn external audit done at the request of the bureau agreed with Mrs. Martin \u2019 s claims , and the CFPB settled with her this summer . She currently holds a new position at the agency and no longer interacts with her former supervisor .\nHowever , CFPB launched a new investigation into Mrs. Martin \u2019 s claims \u2014 hiring yet another independent third-party examiner last month \u2014 to re-examine her case . The new probe has had a chilling effect on those thinking about coming forward with their own grievances , employees said .\nIt was Mrs. Martin who first made the claims of the department \u2019 s so-called \u201c Plantation \u201d where black employees were sent with no clear course of promotions or career track . Formally , the department is called the Office of Consumer Response Intake Section .\n\u201c There is an entire section in Consumer Response Intake that is 100 percent African-American , even the contractors , and it is called \u2018 The Plantation , \u2019 \u201d Mrs. Martin testified . \u201c And people tell me it \u2019 s very hard to leave The Plantation . You must be extremely savvy , or you must [ have ] somebody else [ help you ] to get out . And I will note , you can not say education is a factor , because there are licensed attorneys and [ people with ] advanced master \u2019 s degrees working there . \u201d\nJen Howard , a spokeswoman at CFPB , says Mrs. Martin \u2019 s claims contained inaccurate information .\n\u201c There have been over 50 promotions within the Intake Section , and over 90 percent of the employees in the section who have received at least one promotion are minorities , \u201d said Ms. Howard in a written response .\n\u201c Three employees in the section have been promoted to supervisory roles outside of the section but within Consumer Response , all of whom are African-American . Four employees in the section have been promoted from \u2018 Intake Specialist \u2019 to \u2018 Intake Team Lead , \u2019 all of whom are African-American , \u201d she said .\nNonetheless , the accusations are so serious and widespread that the Government Accountability Office announced this month that it will begin an investigation into CFPB \u2019 s organizational culture and management practices .\nThe investigation was requested by Rep. Patrick T. McHenry , North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Oversight and Accountability Subcommittee , which held the hearings ; by Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling , Texas Republican ; and Consumer Subcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito , West Virginia Republican .\nSince hearings began in April , Mr. McHenry said his office has heard from more than 32 employees complaining about maltreatment at the agency .\n\u201c The treatment of women and minorities at the CFPB is deplorable , \u201d Mr. McHenry said in a statement to The Times . \u201c Unfortunately , due to the unique structure of the bureau \u2014 leaving it free from both congressional and executive branch oversight \u2014 there is little that can be done to stop these rogue agency leaders .\n\u201c While my subcommittee will continue its oversight efforts , ultimately it is Director Cordray \u2019 s responsibility to realize the depth of these issues and finally address the suffering of so many CFPB employees , \u201d he said .\nFor now , Mr. Naraghi , and the many more like him who came forward anonymously , are both negotiating their cases with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and trying to navigate the tricky management system to steer clear of retaliation .\nSome employees interviewed by The Times have since left the agency , giving up hope of any major institutional change in the near future .\nCFPB management \u201c tried to sully my record \u2014 they wanted me to sign a settlement with them and clear them of any wrongdoing . I \u2019 m not going to do that , \u201d said Mr. Naraghi , who is waiting on a hearing date for his grievance case . \u201c What \u2019 s right is right .

I don\u2019t want to bring down the CFPB, but I do have a serious problem with its management.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
