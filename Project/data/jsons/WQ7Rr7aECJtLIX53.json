Boutrous , the lead attorney on the case sponsored by an educational reform group .\nStates across the nation have weakened teaching job protections , including generations-old tenure , to give administrators more flexibility to fire bad teachers .\nTenure was created in the early 20th century to prevent arbitrary or discriminatory firings based on factors such as gender , nationality or political beliefs .
