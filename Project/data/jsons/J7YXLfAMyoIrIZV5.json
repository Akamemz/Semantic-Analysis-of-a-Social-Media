    "content": "You \u2019 d think that investors would run away from a new Wall Street innovation as fast as Congress runs away from a good idea . But instead , they \u2019 re flocking to the latest product peddled by large banking interests , even though they look almost exactly like the mortgage-backed securities that were a primary driver of the financial crisis . These new securities , backed by rental payments , also have real-world implications for millions of renters , who could end up turning in their monthly checks to Wall Street-based absentee slumlords .\nOver the past couple of years , private equity firms and hedge funds have bought up over 200,000 single-family homes , mostly discounted foreclosed properties in communities wrecked by the housing crash , such as Phoenix , Atlanta , Tampa , Sacramento , Los Angeles and Riverside , Calif . They have spent billions to scoop up these vacant homes at fire-sale prices , renovate them , and rent them out , promising investors double-digit annual returns on the rental revenue . Private equity firms like Blackstone , which owns more than 40,000 single-family homes , think they can build an entirely new asset class out of this scheme , controlling the rental market for single-family homes . The irony is rich : Wall Street created the conditions for millions of foreclosures , then they sweep in to buy up the homes and rent them out , often to the same people they kicked onto the street .\nIn order for this to work , firms need cash to outbid the competition . So Blackstone teamed with Deutsche Bank , Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase to put together the first-ever rental revenue bond , named \u201c Invitation Homes 2013-SFR1. \u201d Basically , Blackstone took out mortgages with the banks on 3,207 of its rental properties , in exchange for $ 479 million in cash , and they will forward rental payments to the bondholders to pay back the loan .\nBlackstone plans to use the $ 479 million to purchase more homes . This facilitates the single-family rental scheme , by giving firms a fresh source of cheap money to spend on cornering rental markets , wrestling them away from traditional mom-and-pop rental management companies . The entire industry has looked hopefully upon the Blackstone effort as something they can replicate . One investment firm president remarked , \u201c We \u2019 re rooting for them. \u201d Investors are eyeing the securities as well : With interest rates still minuscule , they want to invest in something that can guarantee them a higher yield .\nLike mortgage-backed securities , the bonds would get sold in tranches , with the senior levels getting rental revenue first , and the junior tranches taking the rest . Rating agencies like Kroll , Morningstar and Moody \u2019 s have blessed the deal , presenting the senior tranches with a triple-A rating , essentially labeling it as perfectly safe for investors . You \u2019 ll remember that mortgage-backed securities were bestowed triple-A ratings during the housing bubble , and that this spurred massive purchases , fueling demand for more and more home loans to create more securities . You can see the same thing happening in the rental market if these securities catch on . In fact , while the most attractive foreclosed properties have already been snapped up , homebuilders are constructing new properties specifically for single-family rentals . Some analysts are concerned that this gold rush will create a new housing bubble in the communities where Wall Street firms are purchasing homes .\nLet me be clear : A rise in renting would not be a bad trend , especially if it created a reasonable alternative to buying a home . The consequences of not paying the rent are certainly lesser than defaulting on a mortgage . And we \u2019 ve seen how homeowners have been abused in countless ways . A robust single-family rental market would provide more housing choices in attractive locations . And viable rental options could theoretically put a check on bubbles \u2013 if home prices get too high , people will just turn to renting \u2013 making overall housing costs more affordable .\nAdditionally , securitization in the abstract is not necessarily something to fear . When done right , it efficiently allocates capital to productive investment opportunities that could even have social value . For example , the solar power company SolarCity just announced solar securities , which could boost the renewable energy space .\nBut securitizing rental revenue is beset with unknowns . The rating agency Fitch underscored many of these concerns when they justified their opposition to rating the Blackstone bond .\nFirst , until the financial crisis , Wall Street firms had no record managing rental properties , and it \u2019 s unclear whether they would be able to quickly fill vacancies , negotiate local rent laws and handle repairs . Because the purchases are concentrated in a handful of metropolitan regions , local variables ( like communities not wanting Wall Street to buy up all the rental properties ) could have an outsize impact . And single-family rentals could fare poorly in an economic downturn , if prospective renters lost their jobs and could not afford to live on their own . With Wall Street owning the newly vacant properties , they could react to a downturn by liquidating them to pay back the bondholders . \u201c The impact of a large scale listing at the neighborhood level could have a significant impact on market clearing prices , \u201d Fitch writes ; in other words , the market could crash under the weight of the mass sell-off , with an impact far beyond the individual properties . Just as securitization inflated and collapsed the residential housing market , it could do the same for rentals .\nThe consequences for 14 million single-family renters in America could be worse . Fears that Wall Street firms would try to trim costs by ignoring maintenance and upkeep have so far been realized . As Ben Hallman at the Huffington Post recently detailed , Wall Street-owned rental homes are riddled with mechanical and plumbing problems .
