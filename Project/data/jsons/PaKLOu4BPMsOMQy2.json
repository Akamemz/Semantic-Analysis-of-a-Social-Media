    "content": "Sugar bashing is all the rage these days , and with good cause . Studies over many years have pointed to sugar as , at the very least , an accomplice , if not the perp , behind many of the health ills of modern civilization . Obesity and diabetes are the obvious candidates caused by over-consumption of the sweet stuff . The obesity epidemic has been written about exhaustively for years , and obesity \u2019 s good friend , Type 2 diabetes , has increased threefold in the past three decades , coinciding with the explosion of sugary products ( both obvious and hidden ) . However , there are a cornucopia of other illnesses and conditions that have lesser-known connections to sugar . The list is long : high blood pressure , hypoglycemia , depression , acne , headaches , hardening of the arteries , fatigue , violent behavior , hyperactivity , aching extremities , and of course , tooth decay .\nIt seems we pay a heavy price for our sweet tooth . Not only do we eat a lot of sugar and make ourselves ill , but it has no nutritional value at all . No vitamins , no minerals , no enzymes , no fiber . ( Honey and molasses lovers could make a teeny tiny case for their sweeteners , since they do have trace amounts of a few nutrients . )\nSugar tastes good . Humans crave sugar right down to their DNA . `` Sugar is a deep , deep ancient craving , '' Daniel Lieberman , an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University recently told Business Insider . Early humans looked for sweet fruits and vegetables because they contained the natural sugars that give us energy . Of course , cavemen were never tempted by Ring Dings or Snickers bars . How badly do we crave sugar ? Here are ( some of ) the shocking statistics :\n1 . Americans consume , on average , 765 grams of sugar every five days . To put that in perspective , in 1822 we consumed on average 45 grams every five days . That is equal to one can of soda . Now we consume 17 times that , or the equivalent of 17 cans of soda .\n2 . Americans consume 130 pounds of sugar every year . Our 1822 predecessors ate under 10 pounds of sugar a year . 130 pounds a year means about three pounds a week . That equals about 3,550 pounds in an average lifetime\u2014approaching two tons of sugar .\n3 . More on that last one : 130 pounds of sugar equals about 1,767,900 Skittles . Or just fill an industrial a dumpster with Skittles .\n4 . The American Heart Association recommends we consume less than 10 teaspoons of sugar a day . The average adult American misses that mark by a lot . Like about 12 teaspoons . The average American gobbles down on average 22 teaspoons a day . And the average child ? 32 teaspoons . Pretty sure none of us needs that much to make the medicine go down . Mary Poppins , it seems , was an enabler .\n5 . Our sugar consumption is both in plain sight and hidden , ingested from the most unlikely places . Sugar in cookies seems obvious . Sugar in potato chips not so much . And ketchup and TV dinners and soup and crackers and just about every other processed food out there . Who are the biggest baddies ? Soft drinks lead the list at 33 % of our sugar consumption ( drink water instead of coke and you \u2019 ve already made a huge dent ) . Candy and other obvious sweets , 16 % . Baked goods like cookies and cakes , 13 % . Fruit drinks 10 % . Sweetened yogurt , ice cream and milk almost 9 % .\n6 . One can of Coke , 12 ounces , contains 10 teaspoons of sugary goodness . That \u2019 s more sugar than two Frosted Pop Tarts with a Twinkie thrown in .\n7 . The average American consumes 53 gallons of soda a year . Let \u2019 s do the math . 128 ounces in a gallon times 53 . That \u2019 s 6,784 ounces . Or just to simplify it , that \u2019 s 565 cans of soda a year .\n8 . If you took away all the sugar in an average American diet , you would subtract 500 calories a day . Of course , since we are not taking it away , that means sugar adds 500 calories a day to our diet ( and waistlines ) . That is like eating 10 strips of bacon a day . Even bacon-loving Americans might stop short of that .\n9 . So , given all the bad stuff : Diseases , bad teeth , expanding waistlines . Zero nutrition . Why do we keep consuming sugar ? Well , there is that DNA connection . Sugar is how we are wired for energy , but evolution never took processed sugar into account . Sweets eaters survived because they ate more energy-efficient fruit and veggie sugar that metabolizes slowly and doesn \u2019 t kill us .\nSugar is as addictive as cocaine .
