We \u2019 ll have to knock on our older neighbor \u2019 s door , call friends and loved ones , volunteer to deliver food to people who can \u2019 t leave their homes , and whatever else we can do to be of use to the people around us .\nBut the reality , Klinenberg says , is that American culture will make this kind of collective effort difficult . We live in a deeply individualistic society , and that way of thinking is corrosive to the cooperation we now need . Yet despite all that , Klinenberg believes there are many things you can do individually to make a significant difference .\nI spoke to him by phone about how we can promote more solidarity in this tumultuous time , why the costs of social distancing are so high for marginalized populations , and why extreme situations like this one reveal deep truths about who we are as a country .\nWhat happens to societies under sustained periods of \u201c social distancing \u201d ?\nI don \u2019 t think we have a long track record of this , so it \u2019 s hard to say . We do know that there \u2019 s variation from society to society , state to state . As a sociologist , what I expect is that these extreme situations expose the essence of who we are and what we value .\nIf you have a society that holds the public good in high regard , and that has been bolstered by strong investments in public institutions , you reap real rewards in moments like this . But if you live in a society that doesn \u2019 t value the common good , that doesn \u2019 t have strong social bonds , then periods like this will be much harder for everyone .\nIf that \u2019 s right , the US is especially unprepared for this crisis . We \u2019 re politically divided , socially fragmented , and we live in a deeply individualistic culture \u2014 that seems like a nightmarish cocktail at a moment like this .\nIt is , and I \u2019 m really worried about it . When you see videos of 20-somethings dancing in crowded nightclubs across the country , that \u2019 s a sign that the urgent public health messaging about why it \u2019 s important to be physically distanced is not getting across . It \u2019 s a sign that people just don \u2019 t care about the consequences of their actions for others .\nWhen you have politicians telling residents that if they \u2019 re healthy it \u2019 s fine to go out to restaurants , bars , to support their local businesses , that \u2019 s a problem . When you have the most popular cable news channel in the country raising questions about the scientific legitimacy of the crisis , and praising the bumbling leader as if he \u2019 s doing everything right , you \u2019 re sending a very confusing message to the public .\nIn the best-case scenario , a diverse and fragmented society would be a kind of testing ground where you could see which places operate best and then model their programs . But that \u2019 s not the situation we \u2019 re in . What we have is widespread confusion and dysfunction . That \u2019 s why I \u2019 m nervous .\nLet \u2019 s set America \u2019 s cultural pathologies aside for a second and assume that , as things get more dire , more and more people will be practicing social distancing . Which population groups suffer the most under that kind of social isolation ?\nWell , there \u2019 s different varieties of suffering , so I am concerned about poor people who are already living paycheck to paycheck , who are already on the edge , who are losing their jobs and not getting enough support to pay the bills , who will be unable to feed themselves and their children , and possibly worse . It \u2019 s incredibly serious .\nAnd there are real health concerns for people who already live alone and are isolated , who really suffer from lack of social contact . We have a massive number of Americans who live alone and who are aging alone . Under ordinary circumstances , or under ordinary conditions , they can go out into public and find companionship in libraries , and senior centers , and parks , and other shared gathering places , but at a time like this , they \u2019 re at real risk of falling through the cracks .\nI want to talk about what we can do to help those people , but first I \u2019 d love to know if we have a lot of data showing the impact of social distancing on marriages , on relationships , on mental health , or any other relevant indicators ?\nI \u2019 m not aware of any solid data on this , but you could see it going either way . The best-case scenario is that families hunker down together , and come to appreciate that they have each other , and learn to cherish fundamental things that we take for granted too often .\nThe worse-case scenario is that couples are stuck together under periods of incredible stress and anxiety , and if they lack the skills and emotional resources to manage the intense feelings that they \u2019 ll have , you could see a lot of relationships fall apart .\nSo it \u2019 s an open question as to whether nine months from now we have a baby boom or a divorce spike .\nAre there any other analogous experiences in the past that we can learn from right now ?\nWe \u2019 ve seen extreme social distancing responses in China , and we could certainly learn something from them , but we have to remember these are very different situations . There are much higher levels of surveillance in China and also much more compliance from the public . Their culture is much less individualistic than our culture . People don \u2019 t worship the market in the same way we do .\nAmerica also has a paucity of public programs . We have a weak public health system , weak public support for all kinds of caring activities , and we rely mostly on the marketplace and on ourselves . But now we \u2019 re at a moment where the market is failing and we \u2019 ve been made far weaker . We , as individuals and families , can only do so much when we \u2019 re on our own , so I think we \u2019 re bumping up against the limits of excessive American individualism and market society .\nWhat you \u2019 re saying is true , and all of America \u2019 s cultural weaknesses are being exposed right now . But if we \u2019 re going to get through this , people are going to have to step up on their own and do their part . You say the only antidote to social distancing is \u201c social solidarity. \u201d Can you lay out your vision ?\nSocial solidarity is the strength we gain as a collective . It \u2019 s what happens when we recognize our interdependence and linked fate . When solidarity is stronger , we \u2019 re more likely to invest in each other \u2019 s well-being , to make individual sacrifices for the common good . We \u2019 re more equal , more just , more honest with ourselves and each other .\nWhen social solidarity is low , we see runaway inequality . We see social atomization . We see disagreement over basic facts . We \u2019 re probably close to a record low in American solidarity right now . The country is bigger and more isolated than it \u2019 s ever been . And this is a social crisis on top of our public health crisis .\nAnd yet it \u2019 s possible that this is the kind of shock event that changes our culture in profound ways . You \u2019 ve argued that crises can be \u201c switching points for states and societies. \u201d What does that mean ?\n\u201c Social solidarity is the strength we gain as a collective . It \u2019 s what happens when we recognize our interdependence and linked fate . \u201d\nIt means there are some crises in which our convictions get tested . Ideology can fold more quickly than you think when your health and your life is on the line . Think about how many anti-vaxxers would walk away from a coronavirus vaccine right now \u2014 I suspect a lot of them would change their minds in a hurry .\nSo I \u2019 m not totally pessimistic about our situation . I think it \u2019 s moments like this that compel us to support one another in new ways . And already I \u2019 m seeing all kinds of small , local programs where people who want to help are finding new ways to do it , and that goes for everything from finding ways to make home meal deliveries to older people who feel too afraid to go outside , to culture and education programs for parents whose children are stuck at home .\nI think a lot of people find it hard to embrace social solidarity while social distancing at the same time . How do you connect with people when you \u2019 re forced to self-isolate ?\nSome of us will have to leave our houses some of the time . We have to get food . We have to get medicine . We have to go for walks , and move around , and so we \u2019 re going to need some people to do deliveries of food to older people , and people with underlying medical conditions , who really need to hunker down . And already there are local projects to set up new food delivery systems for those who can do it . It \u2019 s obviously not easy because there are risks involved , but there \u2019 s no way to get food from the grocery store or restaurant into someone else \u2019 s kitchen without some human effort .\nI \u2019 m talking about small-scale solidarity , about what you can do as an individual to help people in your neighborhood , but there \u2019 s also larger acts of social solidarity , which involve making demands on the government to make paid sick leave mandatory during a crisis , or to provide additional Social Security payments or a universal basic income to everyone , at least during a crisis .\nCutting the interest rates to zero is not the only way that you can boost an economy in a moment like this , and so I think it would be an act of solidarity to push the policies that are better for ordinary people , too .\nAny other recommendations for people who are reading this and want to engage constructively but don \u2019 t know how ?\nI think it goes from the very basic , which is to pick up your phone and text or call the people in your life you \u2019 re concerned about , or just friends you haven \u2019 t spoken to for a while , to say hello and check in . There \u2019 s something profoundly affirming about staying connected in a moment like this , and showing some compassion .\nAnd doing these things will boost your own mood . It feels good to be engaged , to care for other people . The basic sense of solidarity that comes from feeling like you \u2019 re in it together with other people . These are the moments to embrace that .\nI \u2019 d also recommend calling homeless shelters in your neighborhood , and seeing if there \u2019 s anything they need , anything you can do . Find out who \u2019 s running the senior centers in your city or community , and see if they need assistance , or if they have programs to try to provide contact for older people who are isolated .\nI have friends who are single , without children , who have started creating shared programming online for people who are stuck at home with children . I think there are a wide variety of things that we can do , and at times in our history the American capacity for civic imagination and innovation has been impressive .\nUnfortunately , when we talk about innovation these days , we \u2019 re mainly talking about figuring out ways to make more money . I think this is a moment where we have to shift our priorities and put our minds to work on protecting each other .",
