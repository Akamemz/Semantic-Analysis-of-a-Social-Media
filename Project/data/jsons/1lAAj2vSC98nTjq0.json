Reverse the names , rinse , and repeat .\nThe spin will go on in real time via social media and email while Gov . Mike Pence ( R ) of Indiana and Sen. Tim Kaine ( D ) of Virginia duke it out Tuesday night in the campaign \u2019 s one and only vice presidential debate . And after it \u2019 s over , efforts to sway the media narrative and , ultimately , public opinion will continue , perhaps for days .\nImage-making has been around since the beginning of the Republic , but in the era of social media , the art of spin may be changing in profound ways .\nConsider Walter Podrazik \u2019 s class on mass media and politics at the University of Illinois at Chicago . The day after the first Trump-Clinton debate , he asked his students what struck them about the spin .\nSpin ? They didn \u2019 t need to stick around for that , they told Mr. Podrazik . \u201c They had already experienced it , via Twitter , Facebook , and other shared messaging , in real time , while the debate unfolded , \u201d he says .\nThe \u201c before \u201d and \u201c after \u201d spinning is likely to be with us forever , but it \u2019 s the \u201c during \u201d part that has changed the game , thanks to social media . For those who enjoy real-time commentary , experiencing a debate solely within one \u2019 s own social-media ecosystem may point to a hardening of the ideological silos that people inhabit \u2013 and perhaps a hardening of political polarization .\n\u201c Research shows that we tend to interact on social media with people who are kind of like us , \u201d says David Redlawsk , a political scientist at the University of Delaware , Newark , and author of the book \u201c How Voters Decide. \u201d \u201c We don \u2019 t get overly challenged on our beliefs . \u201d\nThat may be no different from old-style socializing \u2013 at the Rotary Club or the women \u2019 s club or the neighborhood corner hangout . But more than ever with major political events , social media has brought analysis and spin into real time , favoring speed over contemplation and setting in motion a narrative that can be hard to change .\nAt the same time , social media can have a democratizing effect . Anybody can jump in with a pithy comment or observation .\nPerhaps Podrazik \u2019 s students are a harbinger of the future \u2013 a world in which a presidential debate ends , and is immediately followed on TV by \u2026 regularly scheduled programing , not pundits offering analysis and partisans trying to shape impressions of what just happened . And at the debate venue itself , maybe there \u2019 s no more \u201c spin alley , \u201d the place where reporters go for a post-game scrum with candidate surrogates .\n\u201c No spin alley , \u201d in fact , was one recommendation last year by the Annenberg Working Group on Presidential Debate Reform . The spin room is a \u201c tired ritual \u201d that adds to the \u201c spectacle \u201d and cost of the debates , and takes away from the real purpose \u2013 to get the candidates to hash out the issues of the day , the group \u2019 s report said . And besides , the spin is already happening via email and Twitter , the report added , echoing Podrazik \u2019 s students .\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates saw things differently , and kept the spin room \u2013 and the live audience , and all the hoopla . Which fit right into Republican nominee Donald Trump \u2019 s plan .\nAs he did after many of the GOP primary debates , Mr. Trump headed straight for the spin room after Monday \u2019 s debate , a first for a major-party presidential nominee . But that \u2019 s Trump , the one-time reality TV star . If there \u2019 s a limelight , he wants to be in the middle of it \u2013 no matter how well ( or not ) he did in a debate .\nSo clearly , it \u2019 s too soon to write off the old way of experiencing political debates . After all , a record-breaking 84 million people watched the first Trump-Clinton debate on TV \u2013 and not everyone , of course , was simultaneously checking the blizzard of insta-punditry available online .\n\u201c TV is still more important than Twitter and Facebook , \u201d says David Greenberg , author of the book \u201c Republic of Spin. \u201d \u201c That may not be true in 20 years\u2026 . But for now , the average citizen interested in politics is going to watch the debates on a TV channel and will be at least somewhat interested in what the anchors and pundits have to say . \u201d\nMany people , too , are curious what the candidate \u201c spinners \u201d have to say . And as long as the ratings are there , the networks will keep showing it \u2013 \u201c not because we believe it lock , stock , and barrel , but because it \u2019 s part of the process , \u201d says Mr. Greenberg , an associate professor of history and of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , N.J .\nViewers know that it \u2019 s spin , he says , because it \u2019 s presented as such .\n\u201c We \u2019 re capable of arguing with it , criticizing it , and seeing through it , if it \u2019 s phony or cynical , and applauding it if it \u2019 s done in the service of the candidate we like and we think it \u2019 s effective , \u201d Greenberg says . \u201c So people aren \u2019 t easily duped by these arguments . \u201d\nStill , there are those who argue for just tuning out once a debate is over .\n\u201c I basically tell people after debates , shut the TV off , \u201d says Kathleen Hall Jamieson , director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia . \u201c Get off social media , and ask yourself , \u2018 What was important to you ?
