Those of us who are strong supporters of the Second Amendment know that Mike Bloomberg single-handedly funds the gun control groups that aim to disarm law-abiding Americans . What 's interesting is that he cherry-picks when he talks about the organization he founded , Everytown for Gun Safety , and its subgroup , Moms Demand Action . Whenever he wants to prove he is a real Democrat or cares about issues the rest of the nation does , he then interjects the amount of money he 's funneled into these gun control groups .\nDuring his town hall with Fox News on Monday , Bloomberg was asked about his desire to disarm average Americans while having an armed security detail .

He made the argument that he repeatedly receives threats but the people who he has hired to protect him are `` all retired police officers who are very well trained in firearms . ''\nIn other words , average Americans are too stupid to know about firearms and the basics of gun safety . Apparently you have to be a law enforcement officer to know those things ( at least in Mini Mike 's mind ) .\nHe went on to say that the only `` restrictions '' he wants to see are background checks . Bloomberg flat out lied and said background checks only take place in gun stores .\nGun rights activist and radio host Dana Loesch torched Bloomberg for not knowing gun laws better than he does .
