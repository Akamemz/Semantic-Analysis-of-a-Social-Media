    "content": "The distinction between nationalism and patriotism proves hard to explain or defend .\nJohn O \u2019 Sullivan had a piece on the NRO homepage Thursday commenting on the debate about patriotism and nationalism , and I can \u2019 t improve upon what he wrote . But I wanted to add a few points about Jonah \u2019 s G-File last weekend .\nFirst , I should say , it was rollicking good fun , and Jonah never fails to astonish and impress with how he can combine wildly entertaining writing with deeply serious arguments . But some pushback :\n\u2014 Jonah is slicing it very , very thin here . In his first reply to our piece , Jonah wrote , \u201c Everyone is born a nationalist , to one extent or another , \u201d and that \u2019 s because nationalism isn \u2019 t a doctrine \u201c but an emotional or psychological state. \u201d It is a \u201c natural human passion \u201d that needs \u201c proper channeling. \u201d Becoming a patriot , per Jonah , takes careful ideological training of the sort set out by a Walter Berns .\nThen , in the G-File , Jonah writes , \u201c People all over the world love their countries. \u201d This makes patriotism sound , if not universal , quite widespread . And what is love , if not itself an emotional or psychological state that needs careful channeling ? Indeed , Jonah talks about how we need to distinguish between different kind of loves .\nHis discussion of this point is genuinely interesting , but it seems to me that Jonah has given away whatever categorical distinction he wanted to maintain . By his account , both nationalism and patriotism are natural to some extent or other , both are passions , and both need to be channeled in constructive directions .\nSo what \u2019 s the fundamental difference between the two ? At the end of the day , Jonah \u2019 s definition seems to come down to patriotism is everything good and right and nationalism is ( mostly ) everything intolerant and dangerous . If we take this literally , patriotism is the only human passion that can never be distorted or go wrong . Patriots never become chauvinists . Patriots never , in an excess of zeal , trample on another country \u2019 s interests or honor . They never , during a time of war , clamp down on dissent . Patriots are paladins of truth and justice , and if they ever misstep they , by definition , become something else \u2014 nationalists , presumably .\nThis definition might make some theoretical sense , but it is completely disconnected from how people act , think , and feel in the real world . The French army that swept across parts of Europe after the revolution was nationalist , yes , but these troops were also fired by a sense of French exceptionalism , a devotion to certain universal ideals , and a belief that they should spread their ideals as far as possible . So they certainly seem to fulfill large parts of Jonah \u2019 s definition of patriotism \u2014 suggesting that even too much patriotism can be a bad thing .\n\u2014 In the G-File , Jonah refines what he initially wrote about how other countries , in contrast to us , fight tribal wars . He gives William the Orange his due ( for the record , I referred in my Corner post to William the Silent , but there \u2019 s no reason Jonah or anyone else should have clicked through to the link of the statue and seen this ) . But Jonah says William \u2019 s patriotism was \u201c fundamentally \u201d different from American patriotism . I might balk at that \u201c fundamentally , \u201d and I think that word reflects an overly reductive view of European history . The Dutch revolt and the English Civil War and Glorious Revolution were part of a great uprising against royal absolutism , and America stands on their shoulders .\nJonah implicitly admits as much when he refers to our \u201c national DNA \u201d and quotes Tocqueville writing that the American was the Englishman left alone . This is absolutely correct , but it underlines that America is a product of a specific culture and isn \u2019 t just an intellectual project .

According to Jonah , Obama couldn \u2019 t truly love the country because he wanted to \u201c fundamentally transform \u201d it .
