Hundreds of thousands of people are participating in protests across the country , and officials are already beginning to meet some of the demands of a nation outraged by racism and police brutality . The four now-former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd , free men a little more than a week ago , today face charges of manslaughter and second-degree murder . Their city , Minneapolis , banned police from using chokeholds and neck restraints . California \u2019 s governor ordered that the state police stop training its officers in performing sleeper holds .\nBut we \u2019 ve been here before . Ferguson was just five years ago , and similar national episodes have placed racist policing under periodic spotlights for the past century . And reform efforts don \u2019 t necessarily move the needle . After all , New York \u2019 s police department banned chokeholds more than twenty years ago , which did nothing at all to save Eric Garner \u2019 s life .\nAfter a first-of-its-kind 1922 investigation documented racist policing in Chicago , \u201c a similar thing happens in Harlem a decade later , and another time in Harlem a decade later , \u201d says Khalil Gibran Muhammad , a historian of race and criminal justice and professor at Harvard \u2019 s John F. Kennedy School of Government . \u201c It 's like each moment forgot the last. \u201d We talked with Muhammad about that history\u2014and how this moment can be different .\nOne of the earliest forms of policing to which black Americans were subjected were Southern slave patrols , groups charged with tracking Africans who ran away from enslavement and with thwarting slave uprisings . After emancipation , Southern states seized upon a loophole in the 13th Amendment , which banned slavery in the United States \u201c except as punishment for crime . \u201d Masses of newly freed black Americans were arrested for offenses as minor as \u201c vagrancy \u201d and pressed into forced labor . Before emancipation , a majority of Southern convicts were white . A few years after the Civil War ended , 70 percent were black . Prison labor helped build the American economy and infrastructure , with convicts working in mines and building railroads .\nIt \u2019 s unsurprising , then , that the 1890 census showed that blacks amounted to a third of all imprisoned people , despite being 12 percent of the US population . This data was used in statistician Frederick Hoffman \u2019 s influential 1896 article \u201c Race , Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro \u201d as evidence of inherent black criminality , rather than , as W.E.B DuBois put it in his review of Hoffman \u2019 s work , evidence that blacks and whites were \u201c subjected to different standards of justice . \u201d\n\u201c By the time we get to the Great Migration , most people took the evidence of the over-representation of African Americans in the criminal justice system as evidence that black people had a particular propensity for crime and could not truly be trusted with their freedom , \u201d says Muhammad . This belief would inform the policing of black people around the country , ensuring that they would be subjected to more scrutiny and brutal tactics than other groups .\nAnd just as racist policing is nothing new , examinations of its damaging effects are by now fairly routine . From the 1920s onward , investigative commissions \u201c become management tools , \u201d says Muhammad . \u201c Civic leaders , state officials and sometimes federal officials say , \u2018 Well , let 's study this problem. \u2019 But the study of the problem always led to the same conclusion , which is that there actually is systemic racism . \u201d\nTake the 1968 Kerner Commission , which examined uprisings , often sparked by police brutality , that swept through black communities in the mid 1960s . The commission found that police and National Guardsmen had fired their guns recklessly at innocent people , and that black communities did not need more heavily armed law enforcement officers , but \u201c a policy which combines ghetto enrichment with programs designed to encourage integration of substantial numbers of Negroes into the society outside the ghetto . \u201d\n\u201c What did [ then-President ] Johnson do with the report ? \u201d asks Muhammad . \u201c Nothing. \u201d He declined to run for re-election , and was succeeded by law-and-order candidate Richard Nixon .\nAnd there have long been piecemeal attempts to reform policing techniques . Louisville EMT Breonna Taylor was shot to death by police in March when plainclothes officers executed a no-knock search warrant on her home . Her boyfriend , a licensed gun owner , initially faced attempted murder charges for shooting one of the officers , before the charges were dropped amid increased national outrage around the case . Now , the ACLU of Kentucky is pushing for the state to end no-knock raids , in which police are not mandated to announce themselves or knock on a door before entering a home .\nBut no-knock raids have been controversial since the 1960s , and a law authorizing them on the federal level was repealed the following decade . Still , the practice is routine in most states , and victims of such raids include 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones , who was shot to death by police in her grandmother \u2019 s home in Detroit in 2010 , and a 19-month-old boy who spent time in a medically-induced coma after police in Atlanta threw a flash-bang grenade into his crib in 2014 .\nWe could already be on a path to more government investigations and pledges of reform\u2014Ohio senator Rob Portman has called for a national commission o n race that would not simply \u201c restate the problem , \u201d but that would \u201c focus on solutions and send a strong moral message . \u201d\n\u201c If you \u2019 re me , if you \u2019 re a professional historian weighing the capacity of law enforcement and the public to take on these changes , \u201d says Muhammad , \u201c you 're very skeptical. \u201d He often cites psychologist Kenneth Clark , who with his wife Mamie pioneered the \u201c doll test \u201d that became crucial to the Supreme Court \u2019 s Brown v.
