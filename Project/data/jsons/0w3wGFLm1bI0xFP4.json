And if they pick candidates who can win over Republicans and independents, that could go a long way in getting them the votes they need to take back the House. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here for more.\n\nHey, Scott.\n\nSCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning.\n\nMARTIN: So Republicans are on defense in the state of Pennsylvania. What's made this state so important in 2018?\n\nDETROW: Pennsylvania's always pretty close. And the Philadelphia suburbs were being viewed as a key battleground because Democrats feel like they can make a lot of gains in the current political climate in the suburbs, going after higher-education, higher-income voters who are turned off by President Trump but otherwise might typically vote Republican. So this was already a focus. Then a couple of things happened to make the state way more competitive.

There was also this gerrymandering case in...\n\nDETROW: Yes.\n\nMARTIN: ...Pennsylvania that's created new districts, no?\n\nDETROW: Yes. It was quite the frenzy over the last few months. The state Supreme Court threw out the map that had been drawn by a Republican legislature and signed by a Republican governor. They said it was too unfair, too gerrymandered in favor of Republicans.

In one of these suburban Philadelphia races that's been vacated, you have 10 Democrats...\n\nMARTIN: Whoa.\n\nDETROW: ...In today's primary.\n\nMARTIN: That's a lot of people (laughter). Anything else you think is particularly notable in the primaries?\n\nDETROW: Yeah, I think the most interesting House primary to flag in Pennsylvania is the Democratic primary in the 7th Congressional District.

You have a whole range of the Democratic Party in this primary - you have a conservative candidate, you have a candidate backed by Bernie Sanders, several others.
