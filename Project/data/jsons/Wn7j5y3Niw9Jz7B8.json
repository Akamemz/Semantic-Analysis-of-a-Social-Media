    "content": "cwick ( Chadwick Matlin , deputy editor ) : Clare , Kaleigh and Maggie , thanks for joining me to talk about the president \u2019 s medicine cabinet . Yesterday , President Trump revealed that he \u2019 s taking hydroxychloroquine , an anti-malarial medication , to help prevent him from contracting COVID-19 . Trump \u2019 s comments were the culmination of his interest in the drug , which he has hyped for months as a way to help fight the pandemic . Let \u2019 s talk about what the science says about hydroxychloroquine , what Trump has said about it , and what it says about Trump that he \u2019 s taking it .\nSo , let \u2019 s start with the science , which is about the only thing that can ground us in this frenzied moment . Can hydroxychloroquine prevent someone from getting COVID-19 ?\nclare.malone ( Clare Malone , senior political writer ) : ( Readers can , on their own time , imagine what else is in the president \u2019 s gold-plated medicine cabinet . )\nmaggie ( Maggie Koerth , senior science writer ) : What we \u2019 re basically looking at here is a massive lack of evidence for anything , Chad .\nkaleigh ( Kaleigh Rogers , science and politics reporter ) : The results from the few studies that have been done are mixed , at best . Some have found hydroxychloroquine reduced the duration of COVID-19 , others have found no difference between using the drug and not , and at least one found there was actually a worse outcome for patients who were on hydroxychloroquine versus those who were not .\nmaggie : There are ongoing studies of better quality happening \u2014 I \u2019 m particularly interested in one that \u2019 s looking at COVID-19 incidence and outcomes in lupus patients who were already taking hydroxychloroquine for their chronic illness \u2014 but we just don \u2019 t have evidence to say it does anything .\nkaleigh : We do know from past trials of hydroxychloroquine that it can cause abnormal heart rhythms , so the president \u2019 s claim that there \u2019 s no harm in trying it is not based on evidence . This isn \u2019 t like taking vitamin C .\ncwick : And are these all studies that test for whether hydroxychloroquine prevents COVID-19 ? Or are they testing whether it improves treatment of the disease ?\nkaleigh : Most trials I \u2019 ve seen are to treat COVID-19 , not to prevent it . ( Though there is at least one trial currently testing it out for preventive use . )\ncwick : So Trump \u2019 s decision to take it preventively complicates things further . We \u2019 re in the dearth-iest corner of the dearth of evidence .\nmaggie : You have the science side of things , which is mostly proceeding as it ought to , and you have the political side , which is full of hype and boom-or-bust demand .\ncwick : With that said , Clare , why is Trump doing this ? Or maybe the better question : Why is Trump telling us he \u2019 s doing it ?\nclare.malone : On a personal level , Trump is likely taking it because of the recent infections of White House staff and because , well , as we all know , he \u2019 s a germaphobe !\nBut I think it \u2019 s a piece of his public response to the outbreak . He attempted , in a quite pitched way at first , to convince the public that things were not as bad as they were made out to be . He promised a non-entity of a disease at first and compared it to the flu . The idea of taking this drug plays into all that , in a more tamped-down way , because he \u2019 s offering the public a sort of \u201c cure \u201d or hope . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a slip of the tongue , but it is a key part of his own thinking about the virus and a key part of how he wants to talk about it in public .\ncwick : That \u2019 s interesting , Clare . One of the defining characteristics of this disease has been its uncertainty . That \u2019 s in part because we haven \u2019 t known how to treat those who are sick ( let alone make the rest of us immune ) . Trump seems to be saying : If a medication is good enough to make the president feel safer , it \u2019 s good enough to make you feel safer .\nmaggie : I \u2019 m interested , Clare , in whether we \u2019 ve seen presidents get so specific in their hope-peddling before . It seems normal for a president to say , \u201c Oh there \u2019 s all this research being done and we will have options , let \u2019 s fund them. \u201d But it feels to me like Trump has uniquely used the bully pulpit to tout specific products \u2014 hydroxychloroquine , that Abbott Laboratories test \u2014 when there was more than one option out there . And it \u2019 s come back to bite him multiple times . Because when science is moving fast , most of the \u201c good ideas \u201d are going to fail at first . Pinning hope on specific brands and products seems like a real risk he \u2019 s taken on .\nclare.malone : Right , Chad . The president has gotten A TON of flak for his refusal to wear a mask , but that \u2019 s also part of his messaging ! It \u2019 s certainly odd that he \u2019 s taking this drug and not wearing a mask , but he \u2019 s a big believer in the sort of traditional displays of \u201c masculine \u201d strength that American politicians have thought the public likes to see . His no-mask thing is the pandemic equivalent of presidential candidates not wearing winter coats while campaigning in Iowa in January .\ncwick : This isn \u2019 t about promoting promising research , or the latest trial results . He is , in effect , becoming part of the trial himself .\nkaleigh : Except it \u2019 s not controlled , randomized or blind , so his \u201c trial \u201d is scientifically meaningless . I drink coffee every day and haven \u2019 t gotten COVID-19 yet \u2014 maybe that \u2019 s a prophylactic , too ! This is the logic of anecdotal evidence .\nmaggie : So this reminds me of the study I saw about how men were significantly less likely than women to take non-pharmaceutical preventive measures in a health crisis , like wearing masks , but were more likely than women to take pharmaceutical measures .\nkaleigh : His announcement that he \u2019 s taking it certainly felt defiant , like he \u2019 s doubling down in spite of the evidence . He also spent some time yesterday criticizing a Veterans Affairs study , which found that patients on hydroxychloroquine actually had a higher risk of death .\ncwick : Kaleigh , your point about the VA study is super interesting . We \u2019 ve seen how the president can dismiss news and findings that run counter to the narrative he wants to promote , and part of his political struggle during this crisis has been knowing when to embrace the science and when to reject it out of hand . By putting his chips in on one drug , the drug itself becomes a cause to rally behind , and news that disputes its power becomes easier for Trump to critique . Essentially , hydroxychloroquine has become part of the White House policy agenda .\nclare.malone : Also , if you \u2019 ve eschewed a lot of the science in your initial stages of your response , you might as well bet big on a miracle cure , right ? Maybe you \u2019 ll be right and people will credit with you being early to the party . Americans do love pharmaceutical solutions to their problems .\nShoutout here to former Sen. Bob Dole , the OG American politician-pharmaceuticals spokesman .\nkaleigh : It is strange that he got so fixated on this one possible treatment , though . The antiviral drug Remdesivir , by contrast , actually has some promising early results . Why is Trump so interested in hydroxychloroquine ? He has scoffed at questions about whether he , say , owns stock in a company that produces the drug , but he also hasn \u2019 t provided a lot of explanation about why he \u2019 s so fascinated with it .\ncwick : Some would have you believe that it might be an issue of cronyism . Here \u2019 s the New York Times from April : \u201c Some associates of Mr. Trump \u2019 s have financial interests in the issue . Sanofi \u2019 s largest shareholders include Fisher Asset Management , the investment company run by Ken Fisher , a major donor to Republicans , including Mr. Trump . A spokesman for Mr. Fisher declined to comment . \u201d\nclare.malone : It \u2019 s a good question . I \u2019 m a bit skeptical of the stock interests answer , since what Trump seems to own is quite negligible . But to Chad \u2019 s point , Trump \u2019 s personal phone line is always known to be open to friends outside the White House ! In the initial stages of the crisis , there \u2019 s a sense that he was hesitant to trigger portions of the Defense Production Act because of feedback from the Chamber of Commerce and private industry .\nmaggie : And meanwhile , his political advocacy has pushed for millions to be spent on it \u2026 supplies acquired by the VA and the Strategic National Stockpile .\nkaleigh : One thing is clear : When Trump touts a treatment , interest goes up . Not only do Google searches soar , but at least one online prescription service reported a nearly six-fold increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine prescriptions after Trump first mentioned the drug .\nmaggie : We know there were people from the anti-vaccine movement promoting the so-called \u201d miracle mineral solution \u201d to him \u2014 a pseudoscience \u201c treatment \u201d that basically amounts to industrial bleach \u2014 before he spent that one press conference talking about treating yourself with disinfectant .\nclare.malone : And we know Trump is susceptible to anti-vaxxers from earlier in his time in public life .\nmaggie : I can see why the open phone line thing would work in real estate \u2014 hot backdoor tips from buddies . But that doesn \u2019 t really work in science .\nclare.malone : But isn \u2019 t it more politics masquerading as science ? Which might be the whole problem .\ncwick : Right , it seems like we \u2019 re all arriving at the same terminus : The president has long demonstrated a contrarian approach to science , so his taking hydroxychloroquine despite iffy science is as much about the political as it is about the personal .\nkaleigh : What is the political motivation to fixate on one drug and also continue to tout it against all current evidence ?\nclare.malone : Momentum . You \u2019 ve already been saying it : Why stop saying it ? ! You \u2019 ll just look more fallible .\nmaggie : This politician in particular really doesn \u2019 t like to be wrong \u2014 maybe even more so than others .\nclare.malone : It \u2019 s the spin zone , y \u2019 all ! Hop on in . It \u2019 s dark , but that \u2019 s what it is .\nkaleigh : Right , changing your mind based on new and better information is bad in politics , for some reason .\ncwick : I \u2019 d say that I \u2019 m reconsidering , but then you \u2019 d think I was weak\u2026",
