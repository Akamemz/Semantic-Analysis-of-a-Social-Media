    "content": "On Thursday , there was a shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis , Maryland . Five people were killed . The shooter , Jarrod Ramos , 38 , was identified using facial recognition technology because he had mutilated his fingertips . This shooting represents one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in American history . The NYPD dispatched units to every major news network in the city out of caution . It \u2019 s an atrocity . It \u2019 s tragic . There are really no words for it ; senseless comes to mind . In the midst of tragedy hitting their offices , The Capital still reported on the attack . Ramos used a shotgun to commit this crime , which was labeled a targeted attack ( via The Capital ) :\nA gunman blasted his way into the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis with a shotgun Thursday afternoon , killing five people , authorities said . Journalists dived under their desks and pleaded for help on social media . One reporter described the scene as a \u201c war zone. \u201d A photographer said he jumped over a dead colleague and fled for his life . The victims were identified as Rob Hiaasen , 59 , a former feature writer for The Baltimore Sun who joined the Capital Gazette in 2010 as an assistant editor and columnist ; Wendi Winters , 65 , a community correspondent who headed special publications ; Gerald Fischman , 61 , the editorial page editor ; John McNamara , 56 , a staff writer who had covered high school , college and professional sports for decades ; and Rebecca Smith , 34 , a sales assistant hired in November . Two others were injured in the attack that began about 2:40 p.m. at the Capital Gazette offices at 888 Bestgate Road in Annapolis . Police took a suspect into custody soon after the shootings . He was identified as Jarrod W. Ramos , a 38-year-old Laurel man with a long-standing grudge against the paper . \u201c This was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette , \u201d said Anne Arundel County Deputy Police Chief William Krampf . \u201c This person was prepared today to come in . He was prepared to shoot people . \u201d\nThe rest of the media should have taken note . There was no drama , commentary , or jumping to conclusions with this story .

No , I \u2019 m not kidding . Not shocking , I know\u2014but it \u2019 s just totally unspooled . Ramos \u2019 beef with The Capital stems back to 2011 .
