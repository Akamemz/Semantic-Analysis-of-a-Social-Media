    "content": "Why did President Trump fire FBI Director James Comey ? The president and top administration officials have offered contradictory accounts in recent days :\nThe official White House statement on May 9 said Trump \u201c acted based on the clear recommendations \u201d of the attorney general and deputy attorney general . But Trump , in an interview two days later , said he was going to fire Comey \u201c regardless of recommendation . \u201d\nTrump said the \u201c FBI has been in turmoil , \u201d and a White House spokeswoman said \u201c the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence \u201d in Comey . \u201c That is not accurate , \u201d according to Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe , who said Comey \u201c enjoyed broad support within the FBI , and still does to this day . \u201d\nTrump fired Comey on May 9 . The White House issued a statement saying , \u201c President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions . \u201d\nRosenstein wrote a two-and-a-half page memo with the subject line \u201c Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI \u201d that stated the reasons why Comey should be removed . The memo cited Comey \u2019 s \u201c handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [ Hillary ] Clinton \u2019 s emails. \u201d Rosenstein criticized Comey for holding a press conference on July 5 , 2016 , to publicly announce his recommendation not to charge Clinton , and for announcing on Oct. 28 , 2016 , that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Clinton .\nComey \u2019 s firing came less than two months after the director confirmed at a congressional hearing on March 20 that the bureau is investigating \u201c whether there was any coordination between the [ Trump ] campaign and Russia \u2019 s efforts \u201d to influence the 2016 presidential election .\nIn January , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a declassified intelligence report that found \u201c Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election \u201d with the goal of hurting Clinton and helping to elect Trump .\nDemocrats have criticized the timing of Comey \u2019 s firing , because of the ongoing investigation . But Trump administration officials said the decision had nothing to do with Russia .\nOn the night of Comey \u2019 s firing , CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper asked White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway , \u201c Why fire James Comey now ? \u201d She cited Rosenstein \u2019 s letter and his bipartisan credentials , noting that he was overwhelmingly confirmed as deputy attorney general .\nConway , May 9 : `` Well , I would point them to the three letters that were received today , Anderson , the letter by President Donald Trump and letter by Attorney General Sessions and really the underlying report by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who the FBI director reports to , the FBI director traditionally reports to the deputy attorney general . Rod Rosenstein was confirmed just 14 days ago by a vote of 94 to 6 by United States senators . He \u2019 s well-respected across both sides of the aisle . He served as U.S. attorney in Maryland under President Obama . And he sent out a memo today to the attorney general and the re line , Anderson , says 'restoring public confidence in the FBI . ' ``\nConway said Trump \u201c took the recommendation of his deputy attorney general , who oversees the FBI director . \u201d\nLater in the interview , Cooper said that \u201c a lot of people are \u2026 saying it destroys people \u2019 s confidence in the FBI \u201d and its ability to investigate whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to interfere in last year \u2019 s election . Conway said the firing \u201c had zero to do \u201d with Russia and \u201c everything to do with \u2026 Mr. Rosenstein . \u201d\nThe next morning , on CNN \u2019 s New Day , Conway repeated the claim : \u201c The president took the advice of the deputy attorney general who oversees the director of the FBI , brought those concerns to the attorney general who brought them to the president . And they made a decision to remove him . \u201d\nOn MSNBC \u2019 s Morning Joe that same morning , White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders echoed the official White House statement and Conway \u2019 s remarks when she was asked why Comey was fired .\nSanders , May 10 : `` I think he \u2019 s heard from the rank and file of the FBI , but particularly someone who had done a thorough review and someone who has the respect and reputation that the deputy attorney general has , he took that seriously . He took the recommendation seriously . And he made a decision based on that . ''\nTrump , however , told NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt in a May 11 interview that he did not base his decision on Rosenstein \u2019 s recommendation .\nHolt , May 11 : `` Monday you met with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein . '' Trump : `` Right . '' Holt : `` Did you ask for a recommendation ? '' Trump : `` What I did is , I was going to fire Comey . My decision . It was not \u2014 '' Holt : `` You had made the decision before they came in the room . '' Trump : `` I was going to fire Comey . There \u2019 s no good time to do it , by the way . '' Holt : `` Because in your letter you said , ' I accepted their recommendation . ' '' Trump : `` Well , they also \u2014 '' Holt : `` So , you had already made the decision . '' Trump : `` Oh , I was going to fire regardless of recommendation . ''\nThe president told Holt , \u201c The FBI has been in turmoil . You know that , I know that . Everybody knows that . You take a look at the FBI a year ago , it was in virtual turmoil , less than a year ago . It hasn \u2019 t recovered from that . \u201d\nTrump and others in the administration have repeatedly made the claim that Comey had lost the confidence and respect of the FBI \u2019 s rank and file .\nIn addition to Trump saying the FBI has been in \u201c turmoil , \u201d Conway on CNN \u2019 s New Day said that \u201c Jim Comey had lost the confidence of people at the FBI . \u201d\nAt a May 10 press briefing , Sanders said the president , members of Congress and the Department of Justice had lost confidence in Comey . \u201c And most importantly , the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director , \u201d Sanders said .\nMcCabe \u2014 a 21-year FBI official who assumed the position of acting FBI director when Comey was fired \u2014 was asked about Sanders \u2019 remark at a May 11 hearing of the Senate intelligence committee . \u201c No , sir , that is not accurate , \u201d he said .\nMcCabe called working with Comey \u201c the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life . \u201d\nMcCabe , May 11 : `` I can tell you also that Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the FBI , and still does to this day .
