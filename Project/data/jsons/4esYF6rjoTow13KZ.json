    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : We turn now to look at the Trump administration and press freedom . On Friday , the White House took the unprecedented act of barring The New York Times , CNN , Politico , the Los Angeles Times , the BBC , and several other news organizations from an off-camera briefing known as a gaggle . Meanwhile , several right-wing news outlets were allowed to attend , including Breitbart , The Washington Times and One America News Network . New York Times editor Dean Baquet said , quote , \u201c Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : Washington Post editor Marty Baron described the White House \u2019 s decision as \u201c appalling , \u201d saying the Trump administration is on , quote , \u201c an undemocratic path . \u201d\nInterestingly , even White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer spoke out against banning news outlets from press briefings\u2014well , that was two months ago . In December , Spicer said , quote , \u201c We have a respect for the press when it comes to the government , that that is something you can \u2019 t ban an entity from . I think that is what makes a democracy a democracy versus a dictatorship , \u201d Spicer said in December .\nJust hours before The New York Times and other outlets were barred from attending the briefing , President Trump spoke at CPAC\u2014that \u2019 s the Conservative Political Action Conference .\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news . It \u2019 s fake , phony , fake . A few days ago , I called the fake news the enemy of the people . And they are . They are the enemy of the people , because they have no sources . They just make them up when there are none . \u2026 There are some great reporters around . They are talented . They \u2019 re honest as the day is long . They \u2019 re great . But there are some terrible , dishonest people , and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people . A tremendous disservice . They are very dishonest people , and they shouldn \u2019 t use sources . They should put the name of the person . You will see stories dry up like you \u2019 ve never seen before .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Donald Trump , speaking at CPAC on Friday . Hours later , CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper began his show by responding to Trump \u2019 s actions .\nJAKE TAPPER : Don \u2019 t misunderstand what \u2019 s going on with that rhetoric and with today \u2019 s action banning various media outlets , including CNN , The New York Times . This White House does not seem to respect the idea of accountability . This White House does not seem to value an independent press . There is a word for that line of thinking . The word is \u201c un-American . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper Friday . Then , on Saturday , President Trump announced he would not attend this year \u2019 s White House correspondents \u2019 dinner . The last president to skip the dinner was Ronald Reagan in 1981 , when he was recovering from an assassination attempt .\nTo talk more about President Trump and press freedom , we \u2019 re joined by Robert Mahoney , who is the deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists .\nLet \u2019 s start with , well , President Trump calling the press \u201c the enemy of the people . \u201d\nROBERT MAHONEY : It \u2019 s very dangerous . I mean , to vilify the press is to undermine its credibility . The press has a very well-defined role in a democracy , which is to hold officeholders and those with power accountable . Here , I think what we \u2019 re seeing is a deliberate attempt to undermine the press so that in the future , when the press does its job and uncovers something that the administration would like to keep quiet , it will be dismissed as \u201c Ah , it \u2019 s false news . It \u2019 s fake. \u201d It \u2019 s very\u2014it \u2019 s very troubling that this should be happening so soon into the presidency .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : And this issue that Trump keeps raising of fake news , really , even the term \u201c fake news \u201d only came into currency toward the end of last year during\u2014toward the end of the electoral campaign , and yet he has now appropriated that term as a description of those who criticize him .\nROBERT MAHONEY : Yeah , and we saw in the campaign that he used this . And the campaign is one thing , but now he has the platform of the presidency , which is very , very powerful . And one of the tactics that candidate Trump used was to stick a description onto someone . We had \u201c crooked Hillary \u201d or \u201c lying Ted. \u201d Now we \u2019 ve got \u201c fake news. \u201d So the\u2014\nROBERT MAHONEY : And the \u201c failing New York Times. \u201d So , you know , for his supporters and for many people , this will stick . And this , as I said , undermines\u2014it \u2019 s a deliberate attempt to undermine the credibility of the independent press .\nAMY GOODMAN : On Sunday , The New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet appeared on CNN \u2019 s Reliable Sources .\nDEAN BAQUET : I have to say , I think there is an effort by this administration to minimize the press , to push the\u2014\nDEAN BAQUET : Yeah , I think that their goal , it \u2019 s just evident , is to make it so\u2014there are a handful of independent institutions whose job it is\u2014and we \u2019 re among them\u2014to critique the president , to hold the president accountable . The judiciary is in the same batch . And I think if you look at the pattern of the president \u2019 s tweets , they \u2019 re actually designed to minimize the institutions who are charged with holding him accountable . And I think that \u2019 s dangerous .\nROBERT MAHONEY : I think he \u2019 s right . It is dangerous . And what we have here is a situation where not only is this bad for the U.S. press , it \u2019 s bad for the press generally around the world , because we look to the United States to act as a champion of press freedom and to stand up for journalists when they get in trouble . If the administration is now dismissing journalists and undermining the value of their work , that \u2019 s bad news for all those journalists who are physically assaulted elsewhere around the world , not just American journalists now who are being verbally assaulted .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Well , I wanted to ask you . Other presidents have had contentious relationships with the press in the past\u2014Richard Nixon , obviously . Bill Clinton , during the Monica Lewinsky scandal , had his difficulties . What do you see that is qualitatively different , if any , about this particular period of conflict now that we \u2019 ve had with Trump ?\nROBERT MAHONEY : Well , we \u2019 re just four weeks into the presidency , and already we \u2019 re having this conversation . There \u2019 s a big difference . It took a while for Nixon and the press to really get into a situation where they hated one another . We have\u2014it \u2019 s more extreme , I would say , at this point . And Nixon , other presidents , they hold power . It \u2019 s natural , and it \u2019 s actually healthy , that there is a certain tension between reporters and politicians . If there isn \u2019 t that tension , then that means that the press isn \u2019 t doing its job . But this is worse than that . We saw the vilification of the press at a\u2014from a public platform on Friday . And then a few hours later came the barring of these news organizations from a briefing . The way that looks is as if the press is being punished if it \u2019 s critical and independent .\nAMY GOODMAN : Let \u2019 s go to Trump \u2019 s chief strategist , Steve Bannon , who also attacked the media during his appearance the day before Trump spoke at CPAC , the Conservative Political Action Conference .\nSTEPHEN BANNON : If you look at , you know , the opposition party and how they portrayed the campaign , how they portrayed the transition and now they \u2019 re portraying the administration , it \u2019 s always wrong . \u2026 The mainstream media or opposition party never caught , is that if you want to see the Trump agenda , it \u2019 s very simple . It was all in the speeches . \u2026 They \u2019 re corporatist , globalist media that are adamantly opposed\u2014adamantly opposed to a economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , that is Steve Bannon , chief strategist , also former head of Breitbart , which was allowed into the gaggle on Friday .\nROBERT MAHONEY : Yeah . I mean , it \u2019 s all laid out for you , that it \u2019 s painting the media as the opposition . The media is not the opposition . The press is the fourth estate . It has a very clear role to play in any democracy . By calling it the opposition , again , you are inoculating yourself , I believe , against future criticism , for when things start to go wrong and the press is digging and doing its job . You will be able to dismiss it as biased and politically affiliated . This sends a very , very dangerous message , and journalists are right to stand up to this at this point and say , \u201c We won \u2019 t accept this . We are not the opposition . We \u2019 re doing our jobs . \u201d\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Well , I can see for these threats\u2014and , of course , Bannon said it \u2019 s going to get worse in the future . But this issue of , for instance , excluding some members of the press from what \u2019 s essentially a small briefing , clearly , you \u2019 re making choices all the time , and groups like The New York Times and CNN and Politico are used to being considered the first ones to be given these briefings . Is there the same kind of criticism about the exclusion from the gaggle that you would have about these threats to the press directly ?\nROBERT MAHONEY : Whether that is repeated or not , I don \u2019 t know . But you take\u2014you take that . It \u2019 s sending a message . These were critical outlets . They weren \u2019 t just\u2014they weren \u2019 t selected at random , it seemed . And it happened straight after the CPAC criticism . You know , journalists\u2014not every journalist can get into a briefing . It was a pool . It \u2019 s a very practical way of sharing information . But everyone that \u2019 s involved in covering the White House said this was unprecedented . So I believe that it had a purpose beyond just that Sean Spicer didn \u2019 t have enough room in his office .\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean , what \u2019 s interesting about the gaggle , it \u2019 s off the record . President Trump attacked reporters for using off-the-record sources , saying they should stop doing this . And yet the gaggle required things to be off the record , and that \u2019 s a criticism of the gaggle , that the White House would often use it over the years to put out perhaps a lie , and then you can \u2019 t attribute it to anyone . Then you \u2019 ve got the White House correspondents \u2019 dinner . The press has made an enormous deal out of that . There are a number of journalists who have not gone to it for years , because it is such\u2014it demonstrates the extremely cozy relationship\u2014\u2588\u2588\u2588 ! hasn \u2019 t gone\u2014between journalists , politicians . They \u2019 ll often invite politicians as guests , or A-list celebrities . But now it \u2019 s President Trump who won \u2019 t go , and this is the first time since the attempted assassination of Reagan , when I believe he called in but he couldn \u2019 t actually get there .\nROBERT MAHONEY : Yeah , I mean , look , there\u2014you can criticize the relationship between journalists and those in power as being cozy , and \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! doesn \u2019 t go to this dinner , neither does The New York Times , for that reason . And as I was saying earlier , it \u2019 s natural that there is some kind of tension between the press and those in power . But now , Trump could have gone to this , if he had wanted to reach out to the press , but he doesn \u2019 t . So , the lines are clearly drawn . This is going to be a very contentious and conflictual kind of relationship .\nAMY GOODMAN : We \u2019 ll see if Alec Baldwin will show up in his stead playing Mr. Trump . Robert Mahoney , we want to thank you for being with us , deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists .\nWhen we come back , the NAACP is calling for a ban of North Carolina . We \u2019 ll go to Raleigh to speak with the Reverend\u2014is calling for a boycott of North Carolina . We \u2019 ll go to Raleigh to speak with the Reverend Barber . Stay with us .",
