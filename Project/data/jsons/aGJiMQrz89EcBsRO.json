He \u2019 s the author of Bearing Right .\nTrayvon Martin is dead , George Zimmerman has been acquitted , and millions of people are outraged . Some politicians are demanding a second prosecution of Zimmerman , this time for hate crimes . Others are blaming the tragedy on \u201c Stand Your Ground \u201d laws , which they insist must be repealed . Many who saw the case as proof of racism in the criminal justice system see the verdict as further confirmation . Everywhere you look , people feel vindicated in their bitter assumptions . They want action .\nBut that \u2019 s how Martin ended up dead . It \u2019 s how Zimmerman ended up with a bulletproof vest he might have to wear for the rest of his life . It \u2019 s how activists and the media embarrassed themselves with bogus reports . The problem at the core of this case wasn \u2019 t race or guns . The problem was assumption , misperception , and overreaction . And that cycle hasn \u2019 t ended with the verdict . It has escalated .\nI almost joined the frenzy . Yesterday I was going to write that Zimmerman pursued Martin against police instructions and illustrated the perils of racial profiling . But I hadn \u2019 t followed the case in detail . So I sat down and watched the closing arguments : nearly seven hours of video in which the prosecution and defense went point by point through the evidence as it had been hashed out at the trial . Based on what I learned from the videos , I did some further reading .\nThe 911 dispatcher who spoke to Zimmerman on the fatal night didn \u2019 t tell him to stay in his car . Zimmerman said he was following a suspicious person , and the dispatcher told him , `` We do n't need you to do that . '' Chief prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda conceded in his closing argument that these words were ambiguous . De la Rionda also acknowledged , based on witness and forensic evidence , that both men \u201c were scraping and rolling and fighting out there. \u201d He pointed out that the wounds , blood evidence , and DNA didn \u2019 t match Zimmerman \u2019 s story of being thoroughly restrained and pummeled throughout the fight . But the evidence didn \u2019 t fit the portrait of Martin as a sweet-tempered child , either . And the notion that Zimmerman hunted down Martin to accost him made no sense . Zimmerman knew the police were on the way . They arrived only a minute or so after the gunshot . The fight happened in a public area surrounded by townhouses at close range . It was hardly the place or time to start shooting .\nThat doesn \u2019 t make Zimmerman a hero . It just makes him a reckless fool instead of a murderer . In a post-verdict press conference , his lawyer , Mark O \u2019 Mara , claimed that \u201c the evidence supported that George Zimmerman did nothing wrong , \u201d that \u201c the jury decided that he acted properly in self-defense , \u201d and that Zimmerman \u201c was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense . I \u2019 m glad that the jury saw it that way. \u201d That \u2019 s complete BS . The only thing the jury decided was that there was reasonable doubt as to whether Zimmerman had committed second-degree murder or manslaughter .\nZimmerman is guilty , morally if not legally , of precipitating the confrontation that led to Martin \u2019 s death . He did many things wrong . Mistake No . 1 was inferring that Martin was a burglar . In his 911 call , Zimmerman cited Martin \u2019 s behavior . \u201c It \u2019 s raining , and he \u2019 s just walking around \u201d looking at houses , Zimmerman said . He warned the dispatcher , \u201c He \u2019 s got his hand in his waistband. \u201d He described Martin \u2019 s race and clothing only after the dispatcher asked about them . Whatever its basis , the inference was false .\nMistake No . 2 was pursuing Martin on foot . Zimmerman had already done what the neighborhood watch rules advised : He had called the police . They would have arrived , questioned Martin , and ascertained that he was innocent . Instead , Zimmerman , packing a concealed firearm , got out and started walking after Martin . Zimmerman \u2019 s initial story , that he was trying to check the name of the street , was so laughable that his attorneys abandoned it . He was afraid Martin would get away . So he followed Martin , hoping to update the cops .\nMistake No . 3 was Zimmerman \u2019 s utter failure to imagine how his behavior looked to Martin . You \u2019 re a black kid walking home from a convenience store with Skittles and a fruit drink . Some dude in a car is watching and trailing you . God knows what he wants . You run away . He gets out of the car and follows you . What are you supposed to do ? In Zimmerman \u2019 s initial interrogation , the police expressed surprise that he hadn \u2019 t identified himself to Martin as a neighborhood watch volunteer . They suggested that Martin might have been alarmed when Zimmerman reached for an object that Zimmerman , but not Martin , knew was a phone . Zimmerman seemed baffled . He was so convinced of Martin \u2019 s criminal intent that he hadn \u2019 t considered how Martin , if he were innocent , would perceive his stalker .\nMartin , meanwhile , was profiling Zimmerman .
