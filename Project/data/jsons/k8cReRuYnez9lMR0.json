'' Trump said as Xi watched on from a few feet away . Nervous laughter rippled through the crowd of Chinese and American business executives , whose firms are inking new deals here in a spectacle meant to demonstrate Trump 's negotiating prowess .\n`` I give China great credit , '' he added . `` In actuality , I do blame past administrations for allowing this trade deficit to take place and grow . ''\nTrump reaffirmed his position Friday morning , tweeting : `` I do n't blame China , I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $ 100 's of billions . How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue ? I would 've done same !

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 9 , 2017\nIt was a remarkable show of deference to Xi , who emerged from last month 's Communist Party Congress the most powerful Chinese leader in a generation .

At the top of a bilateral meeting , the accolades dripped from Trump 's mouth as he expressed his gratitude for the welcome mat Xi had laid out .\nThey had an `` absolutely terrific '' dinner . It was a `` very , very great honor '' to be together . The military display was `` magnificent . '' And their relationship ? `` A great one . ''\nTrump did not avoid pointing out China 's `` unfair trade practices '' and its `` theft of intellectual property , '' but his conclusion that the imbalance in the US-Chinese trade relationship was the fault of his predecessors ignored the role of China 's system of state-run enterprises and limiting market access policies .\nTrump 's discussions with Xi yielded no immediate signs that the structural changes needed to rebalance the relationship were coming .\n`` There was a little bit of tongue in cheek in that characterization , but there was also a lot of truth to it , '' Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in explaining Trump 's remark . `` I think what the President was just reflecting on is , look , we are where we are because previous administrations , whether through benign neglect -- which is my own characterization of it -- or for whatever reasons allowed this to happen .

''\nTrump has held few consistent positions on policy issues during his decades of flirtation with a presidential run , but his stance on China has long been a notable exception .\nHis long-held view of China as an economic boogeyman became a central part of his `` Make America Great Again '' campaign platform that promised a rebirth of US manufacturing .\n`` We ca n't continue to allow China to rape our country and that 's what they 're doing . It 's the greatest theft in the history of the world , '' Trump told a campaign crowd in May 2016 .\nBut Trump 's heavy-handed criticism of China was often also mixed with a similar dose of criticism for US officials , whom he accused of getting outmaneuvered by Chinese negotiators .\n`` You can win against China if you 're smart . But our people do n't have a clue . We give state dinners to the heads of China . I said why are you doing state dinners for them ? They 're ripping us left and right . Just take them to McDonald 's and go back to the negotiating table , '' Trump told a crowd in the first summer of his presidential campaign .\nWhile Trump publicly took a more conciliatory approach to China , several thousand miles away in Michigan , his former chief strategist , Steve Bannon , carried forward the mantle of Trump 's past criticism , warning that the country is a `` dictatorship that sees us as an enemy to be defeated . ''\nWith that backdrop , it remains unclear how Trump 's more measured approach to his old campaign trail villain will go over with his base , including those blue-collar voters in Michigan who are counting on Trump to take a hardline against China -- and are still listening to Bannon .\nSo far , it appears Trump 's formula for winning against China amounts to excessive praise and , at least publicly , absolving China of blame for its role in crafting policies that have disadvantaged the US .\nTrump also avoided putting his host in an uncomfortable position , making none of the demands his past three predecessors have made that Xi take questions alongside him from independent journalists .\nTouring Asia this week for the first time , Trump has found plenty of leaders willing to satisfy his craving for praise .
