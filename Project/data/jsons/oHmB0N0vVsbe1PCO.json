'' I do n't claim to be a prophet , but is my statement not vindicated by America 's present turmoil ?\nKaufmann polled American liberals to gauge their willingness `` to jettison the country 's cultural identity . '' On May 7 ( before the George Floyd killing ) , he surveyed a sample of 870 Americans who `` lean young , liberal , and white .

He consciously removed conservatives and centrists to focus only on self-described liberals . He presented them with 16 `` outlandish '' statements and was `` amazed '' by their answers . He surveyed them again on June 15 , after the Floyd killing and subsequent protests , and found that things `` had gotten even crazier . ''\nHe asked them to agree or disagree that Americans should :\n`` 1 . Rebalance the history taught in schools until its voices and subjects reflect the demographics of the population and heritage of Native people and citizens of color\n`` 2 . Move , after public consultation , to a new American anthem that better reflects our diversity as a people\n`` 3 . Rename our cities and towns until they match the demographics of the population\n`` 4 . Rebalance the art shown in museums across the country until an analysis of content shows that it reflects the demography of the population and perspective of Native people and citizens of color\n`` 5 .

Rename our states until they better reflect the heritage of Native people and citizens of color\n`` 7 . Gradually replace many older public buildings with new structures that do n't perpetuate a Eurocentric order , until a more representative public space is achieved\n`` 8 .
