    "content": "In their continuous efforts to create the impression that the government is doing something to keep Americans safe , politicians in Washington have misled and lied to the public . They have violated their oaths to uphold the Constitution . They have created a false sense of security . And they have dispatched and re-dispatched 60,000 federal agents to intercept the telephone calls , text messages and emails of all Americans all the time .\nIn the process , while publicly claiming they only acquire identifying metadata -- the time , date , location , duration , telephone numbers and email addresses of communications -- they have in fact surreptitiously gained access to the content of these communications .\nOn June 1 , one of the three claimed legal authorities for all this , Section 215 of the Patriot Act , expired , as Congress was unable to agree on either its reinstitution or the enactment of a substitute . At the time that Section 215 was about to expire , President Obama , Attorney General Lynch and FBI Director Comey warned that the NSA \u2019 s computers would go dark and the American public would be at the mercy of our enemies . Their warnings were nonsense .\nThe NSA is a military entity that utilizes the services of military computer experts and agents , employs civilians , and hires companies that provide thousands of outside contractors . After nearly 14 years of spying on us -- all authorized by a secret court whose judges can not keep records of what they have ordered or discuss openly what they know -- the NSA now has computers and computer personnel physically located in the main switching offices of all telecom and Internet service providers in the United States . It has 24/7 access to the content of everyone \u2019 s telephone calls , emails and text messages .\nThe data amassed thereby is so vast that the government can not sift through it quickly or effectively enough to stop such notorious events as the Boston Marathon bombings , the Ft .

The Justice Department acknowledged this last month when it revealed that all this spying has not succeeded in stopping any terrorist plots and has not aided any federal prosecutions of terrorism .\nThen why do it ? Because the feds want to calm American nerves by giving the impression that they are doing something -- even though we know that they know that what they are doing fails to keep us safe .

Without this probable cause requirement , nothing would stop the government from searching and seizing whatever it wants . Yet that is where we are today . The NSA \u2019 s unconstitutional standard of \u201c government need \u201d reinstitutes the general warrants -- search where you wish and seize what you find -- which the Fourth Amendment was written to prohibit .\nBoth the Patriot Act and the Freedom Act , the substitute law enacted by Congress , do away with the probable cause requirement . Both of those laws permit the FISA court to issue general warrants based on the government \u2019 s needs , rather than probable cause .

The propaganda that its computers were shut down is false . Section 702 of the FISA law and President Bush \u2019 s October 2001 executive order were and are still valid , and both have been interpreted to unleash the NSA .\nSection 702 permits warrantless surveillance of Americans who speak with foreigners , and the NSA has gotten FISA warrants to intercept the calls of the folks to whom those Americans speak , to the sixth degree .
