    "content": "The praise music is blasting , and so is the air conditioning , as 50 or so people gather for Sunday morning service in the small worship hall of Freedom Church Assembly of God in Fredericksburg , Virginia . It is a casual affair ; I \u2019 m wearing jeans but my accompanying blazer makes me a bit overdressed in a group where cargo shorts and Hawaiian shirts are the prevailing sartorial choice , at least for the men .

But in truth , politics is never that far away in Donald Trump \u2019 s America . Despite speculation that evangelicals would have a hard time supporting a thrice-married locker-room jockey who bragged about grabbing women \u201c by the pussy \u201d and who had in the past supported abortion rights , white evangelicals rallied to Trump as they had to with Republican presidential candidates before , breaking 80-20 for him in 2016 .

I \u2019 ve visited Freedom Church a number of times over the past few years , and everyone I have met there supported Trump , but , with only one exception that I can remember , only as a fallback after their first or second or even third preferred candidate ( think Ben Carson or Ted Cruz ) dropped out of the race .

I wasn \u2019 t expecting much change : John Inazu , a professor at Washington University School of Law and a board member of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship , a national evangelical college ministry , had already braced me with his observation that \u201c there has not been a ton of movement \u201d and that increasingly white evangelicals , like virtually all identity groups , have retreated into their political foxholes . Recent polling backs him up : according to an April poll from the Public Religion Research Institute , 75 percent of white evangelicals hold a positive view of Trump \u2019 s performance , compared to only 22 percent that disapprove .\nThe continued support for Trump was borne out in my morning at Freedom Church .
