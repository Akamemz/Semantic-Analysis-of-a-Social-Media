( Erich Schlegel/Reuters )\nIt \u2019 s enough to drive even the most mild-mannered Texan crazy .\nAttention , journalists of America : Time is running out ! You have under three weeks left to publish your last batch of over-the-top pre-election puff pieces on Texas Democrat/cross-country liberal sensation/wing-and-a-prayer Senate candidate Beto O \u2019 Rourke !\nIt is here that we must face the difficult truth : Barring a GOP-related disaster of some sort , O \u2019 Rourke \u2014 he of that ineffable \u201c cool factor \u201d and \u201c special sauce , \u201d at least according to easily impressed columnists at the Washington Post \u2014 is likely to lose big . According to the latest polls , Senator Ted Cruz leads him by anywhere between seven and nine points . Tuesday \u2019 s debate between the two , meanwhile , was so mismatched that O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s best moment might have involved a random deer-in-the-headlights story in which he described how he \u201c got to meet this blind squirrel who is slowly regaining its sight . \u201d\nIn summary , this year \u2019 s Betomania \u2014 a somewhat weird phenomenon , as we \u2019 ll explore in a bit \u2014 seems set to disappear from view just as quickly as it arrived , at least in the Lone Star State . On one hand , this possibility warms my heart , given that in my neck of Texas , it has grown rather exasperating to have to wade through 15,000 blaring BETO yard signs when I \u2019 m simply trying to get a breakfast taco or four . On the other hand , I also feel a tinge of melancholy and regret about all of this , given that I never got my act together enough to print ironic t-shirts with the following brilliant slogan I made up all by myself : \u201c You BETO vote for Ted Cruz . \u201d\nAnyway , back to the matter at hand . I \u2019 d like to further discuss the debate between O \u2019 Rourke and Ted Cruz , and also actual policy issues , and also perhaps the fact that many people in politics seem to be slowly going insane . But first , can we talk about how embarrassing Betomania is ? Friends , I am deeply concerned for our culture . When you look at a middle-aged establishment politician as an icon of \u201c rock star \u201d cool , you \u2019 re doing something wrong .\n\u201c Skateboarding Beto O \u2019 Rourke Shreds Whataburger Parking Lot , \u201d read an actual recent headline on the website of the Dallas Morning News . This all sounds really rad and sick and gnarly and whatever until you actually watch the video , which features O \u2019 Rourke gently coasting around the parking lot , soccer-dad style , looking precariously close to biting the dust when he gives a bystander a high five . Don \u2019 t get mad : I \u2019 m not judging ! I would do exactly the same thing , except I \u2019 d probably actually fall ! But no wide-eyed journalist would write a headline claiming that I \u201c shredded \u201d anything , nor credulously act like I belonged on the cover of Thrasher magazine .\nOf the countless head-scratching elements of the O \u2019 Rourke phenomenon , one wins handily as the head-scratchingest of all : A troubling percentage of the Betomaniacs I have met in Texas moved here after fleeing places ruined by Beto \u2019 s favored policies . These locales are often expensive , increasingly dysfunctional , wildly overregulated , sometimes mystifyingly poop-ridden despite being wildly overregulated ( here \u2019 s looking at you , San Francisco ! ) , and inevitably run by Democrats . Why does no one seem to make this connection ? I don \u2019 t know ! One hero in Austin has taken to posting stickers around town featuring an image of a giant locust , paired with the following text : \u201c I MIGRATED TO A THRIVING TEXAS FROM A LEFTIST [ NIGHTMARE ] AND NOW I \u2019 M VOTING FOR BETO FOR SENATE. \u201d ( The posters feature a word much worse than \u201c nightmare , \u201d which I \u2019 m not reprinting because I run a PG-13 column here . )\n\u201c But Heather , \u201d you might be thinking . \u201c Surely you must have seen the countless articles in national publications describing how annoying Ted Cruz is and how Beto O \u2019 Rourke is going to lead our generation in rising up above the terrible cynicism that dominates modern politics , acting as a bridge uniting and respecting the diverse voices of Texans as long as you join in lockstep support for things like abortion on demand , higher taxes , and a list of leftist hobbyhorses that drive out-of-state donors wild ! \u201d\nWhy yes , thanks , I have read those articles . I laugh every time !\nI used to think that O \u2019 Rourke didn \u2019 t even really want to win \u2014 if he did , after all , wouldn \u2019 t he at least pretend to be even a teensy bit more moderate ? \u2014 but Tuesday \u2019 s debate disabused me of that notion . Judging by the slightly panicked facial expression that emerged from time to time , he really does want to win . ( As an aside , I don \u2019 t know which jokester at the TV station made O \u2019 Rourke stand in front of an image of multiple oil rigs relentlessly pumping while Cruz pummeled him for supporting a massive gas tax , but sir or madam , here \u2019 s to you . )\nAlas , now that times have gotten tough , after months of nice-guy \u201c rise above the fray \u201d narratives , Mean Beto has finally emerged . On Tuesday , he whipped out Trump \u2019 s old \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d nickname for Cruz , and his campaign has launched a series of attack ads claiming Cruz is engaged in \u201c selling paranoia and fear. \u201d Well , politics is politics .

Okay , okay , I \u2019 ll stop . I \u2019 m sorry . I blame the unending sea of yard signs . They could probably crack the best of us .",
