If she is black in Georgia , she is three times more likely to die of complications during or after her pregnancy than a white woman in the same position . Her child is more likely to attend underfunded schools , face a return to \u201c tough on crime \u201d policies that target black and brown people , and live in a state with a minimum wage of $ 5.15 an hour .
