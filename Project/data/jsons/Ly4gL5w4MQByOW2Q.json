    "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren used to be known for arguing that the government should n't make money on student loans . Now she 's arguing that students should n't have to take out loans in the first place .\n`` While not every college needs to graduate every student debt-free , every kid needs a debt-free option\u2014a strong public university where it \u2019 s possible to get a great education without taking on loads of debt , '' she said today in a speech at the Shanker Institute .\nDebt-free college is more progressive than simply making tuition free , as Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed .\nThat 's because for the poorest students , tuition is often covered by grants , but they still have to pay living expenses .\nThe debt-free idea is spreading : Hillary Clinton 's campaign has hinted a few times that it has a debt-free higher education plan of its own .\nThis is a big shift . The Obama administration 's policies have generally accepted some student debt as a necessary evil , or even a positive good ; research has found that students with small amounts of debt are more likely to graduate college . Instead , they 've tried to make it easier for students to pay their loans back , not take on the loans in the first place .\nSupporters of debt-free college argue that there 's nothing new or radical about their proposals . In the 1970s and early '80s , students could work their way through college at a public university . Encouraging states to spend more on higher education and lower tuition prices , they argue , is just a return to an earlier status quo .\nBut it 's also true that in the long term , people who take on student loans and get degrees fare better than people who never graduate college . The big question for debt-free college is n't just whether it will make college graduates ' lives easier \u2014 it 's whether it can help more people , particularly from low-income backgrounds , to graduate college in the first place .\nMore students borrow to go to college than ever before , and they take on more debt each year . About 70 percent of students earning bachelor 's degree in 2013 had loans ; on average , they owed more than $ 30,000 at graduation , according to the Institute for College Access and Success .\nAnd as colleges have increased their prices , the buying power of federal financial aid has fallen . The biggest possible Pell Grant , which goes mostly to low-income students , used to cover about half of the price of a four-year college education . Now it covers only slightly more than a quarter .\nThis has n't affected everyone equally . The burden of debt falls more heavily on minority students and students of color : 84 percent of low-income students at public universities borrow to attend college , compared with just 46 percent of their peers who are n't getting Pell Grants . About 80 percent of black students borrow to attend a public university , compared with 63 percent of white students .\nThat debt can impact their financial life for a generation . College graduates with debt are less likely to have saved for retirement and less likely to buy houses than their peers who did n't take on loans .\nOne of the reasons student debt has increased is that students , not states , are paying more of the cost of public higher education . So getting state governments to pay more of the cost , and making tuition cheaper or even free , has emerged as one solution .\nIn the State of the Union address , President Obama called for two years of free community college . Sen. Bernie Sanders upped the ante as he started his presidential campaign , saying that tuition at public colleges should be free to students for four years .\nBut as ambitious as making tuition free is , getting rid of student debt is even harder .\nSanders 's proposal for free tuition at public universities would n't eliminate student debt . There 's a difference between `` free tuition '' and `` debt-free . ''\nTo understand why , just look at Sweden . College is free in Sweden . But students there graduate with a surprisingly high amount of debt \u2014 around $ 19,000 . That 's because tuition is n't always the biggest cost of going to college .\nParticularly at colleges where tuition is cheap , rent , housing , food , child care , and transportation end up being the biggest expenses . The poorest students at public colleges typically have the entire cost of their tuition covered by grants , according to the College Board . But they still have to pay their living expenses . And the more students from low- and middle-income families borrow , the more likely they are to drop out .\nThe congressional Democrats , including Warren , calling for debt-free college have n't released the specifics of their plans yet . But outside groups have proposed their own ideas .\nThe most specific plan for debt-free college so far comes from Demos , a progressive think tank . It defines a `` debt-free '' degree as a degree students could pay for by working 10 hours per week at minimum wage while enrolled in college . That means students ' cost of attendance not covered by grants and scholarships , including books , tuition , and living expenses , could n't exceed about $ 2,500 per year .\nDemos calls for the federal government to help states shoulder the cost of higher education . States that commit to offering a debt-free degree for low- and middle-income students \u2014 families making up to about $ 60,000 per year \u2014 would have 60 percent of the cost covered by the federal government . States could get bonus matching funds by increasing spending per student over current levels .\nDemos estimates the plan would cost about $ 29 billion per year and affect 60 percent of students at public universities .\nYoung Invincibles , an advocacy group representing Americans under 35 , has suggested seven strategies that together could reduce debt . The biggest is tying the maximum Pell Grant to the average in-state tuition cost \u2014 nearly doubling the need-based federal aid at a cost of $ 21 billion .\nIf Clinton really does propose debt-free college , it will be a shift from the past six years of higher education policy .\nThe free community college proposal aside , Obama 's policies mostly have n't focused first and foremost on preventing students from needing to take out loans . Instead , the administration has tried to make sure that students can afford their payments after graduation . They 've tried to get colleges to disclose more information about what students can expect to make after graduation . They 've made it possible for students with low incomes to pay less on their student loans each month . And they 've urged colleges to focus on their graduation rates , because graduating college is the best predictor of students being able to make their loan payments .\nIn other words , they 've accepted some debt for a four-year college degree as a fact of life . They 've focused on making sure students can manage that debt without too much trouble .\nThat 's been the dominant consensus even among liberal-leaning groups . The Center for American Progress has called for making college much more affordable , for example , but its proposals would n't eliminate student debt entirely .\nThe big , overarching goal of higher education policy is more college graduates . Some kind of postsecondary education is now a virtual economic necessity . The US has fallen behind the rest of the world in college graduation rates . And college-going is tightly tied to socioeconomic status : students from wealthier families are much more likely to attend and graduate than students from the bottom of the income ladder .\nSo the question around debt-free college is n't just whether it will make students ' lives easier in college and after graduation . It 's whether spending billions of dollars to make debt unnecessary is the best way to help low-income students earn a college degree .\nStudents drop out of college for a complicated web of reasons . But one factor is often summed up as `` life gets in the way '' \u2014 troubles with work , transportation , child care , and other issues , often economic , make it harder for students to go to class and complete their degrees . A 2011 study from the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that balancing work and school was the biggest challenge for students who dropped out . That suggests making college affordable to a student with a part-time , minimum-wage job could make a difference , at least for students who are n't also supporting their families .\nOn the other hand , the evidence also suggests that for most people , student debt from public colleges is a manageable burden . About 9 percent of students who took out loans to attend four-year public colleges defaulted on those loans in the first three years of paying them back , below the national average for all loans .\nFour-year colleges also skew wealthier than society as a whole . Low-income students have lower college attendance rates than wealthier students , and only about a third of them are at public universities . ( The rest are mostly at for-profit colleges and community colleges . ) And while 60 percent of students at public colleges come from families making $ 60,000 per year or less , only 22 percent come from families making less than $ 30,000 per year .\nAny attempt to force states to spend more on higher education , let alone enough to make college debt-free , would require not just a Democratic president but a Democratic majority in Congress . So it 's not likely to become law anytime soon .\nThere 's also little precedent for this . While the 2009 stimulus bill included a requirement that states maintain their spending on higher education , the proposals from Demos , Young Invincibles , and others are an unprecedented federal-state partnership . The best analogy is Obamacare 's Medicaid expansion \u2014 which many red states never signed on for , even with much more generous terms for a state and federal match .\nSo it might be best to see Warren 's proposals \u2014 and , eventually , Clinton 's \u2014 more as symbolic flag-planting . Halting the trend of rising student debt , for progressives , is no longer enough . The agenda is increasingly about reversing it .\nCorrection : The estimated price tag for Demos 's plan is $ 29 billion .",
