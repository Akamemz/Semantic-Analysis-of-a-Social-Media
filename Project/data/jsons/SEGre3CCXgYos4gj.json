They \u2019 re so determined to provide tax giveaways to the rich that they \u2019 re willing to raise premiums on millions of middle-class Americans and kick 13 million people off their health care , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .\nHe predicted that the bill would sour more Americans on the Republicans \u2019 plans .\nBut Republican leaders are counting on the move to win over wavering senators , saying the savings from nixing the mandate can be pumped back into even bigger tax cuts for the middle class .\nBefore the mandate , the Senate plan amounts to a $ 1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years , with about 60 percent going to businesses and the rest going to individual taxpayers . The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and lowers the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent while adjusting other individual tax brackets so they kick in at higher income thresholds .\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch said including the mandate repeal allows Republicans to be even more ambitious with their plan .\n\u201c By scrapping this unpopular tax from an unworkable law , we not only ease the financial burdens already associated with the mandate , but also generate additional revenue to provide more tax relief to \u2026 individuals , \u201d Mr. Hatch said .\nThe 20 percent corporate rate would be permanent but the new individual income tax rates would expire after 2025 under the modified outline Mr. Hatch released Tuesday evening .\nThe new plan costs about $ 1.415 trillion \u2013 down from the $ 1.496 trillion plan rolled out last week .\nMr. Hatch also announced other revisions Tuesday , including a doubling of the child tax credit from the current $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 \u2014 up from $ 1,650 in the first plan \u2014 and some other tweaks to individual tax rates .\nAnother revision makes changes so more \u201c pass-through \u201d companies that file their taxes as individuals can claim a new 17.4 percent deduction Republicans say is designed to give a boost to small businesses .\n\u201c The pass-through provisions in the chairman \u2019 s mark have been further streamlined to ensure these critical job creators have access to the resources they need to further expand , help hire new workers , and increase employee take-home pay , \u201d Mr. Hatch said .\nThe plan also eliminates a number of deductions , such as the one for state and local taxes paid , and uses the savings to pay for lowering the rates .\nWith the plan bumping up against the $ 1.5 trillion cap set in the 2018 budget for tax cuts , lawmakers were left searching for new ways to free up money to do even more for the middle class .\nEnter the individual mandate plan , which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the government more than $ 300 billion over the next 10 years by freeing people from the obligation to have health care coverage \u2014 and the government from the responsibility of subsidizing much of that coverage .\nSome 13 million fewer people would have coverage in 2027 without the pressure from the mandate .\nSome Republicans had long pushed for the move , saying it was the natural solution to their failure this year to repeal Obamacare .\nSen. Patrick J.
