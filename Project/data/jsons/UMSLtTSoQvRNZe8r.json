    "content": "Hillary Clinton , FiveThirtyEight tells us , is the most dominant debate winner in recent presidential history . They did all that ciphering they do over there and decided she won her three debates by +71 , the highest score going back to 2000 . She did it by being well prepared , yes . But she also did it , and bigly , by just standing there and taking his crap .\nGod bless the split screen ; as he spoke , I kept my eyes fixed on her face , to see if she flinched when he said she belonged in jail and the rest . Not once . And she proved unflappable again , and even more so , Thursday night at the Al Smith Dinner . He was so obnoxious . He didn \u2019 t just cross the line ; he crawled into a cannon and catapulted himself over it . She hates Catholics ? Really ? At a Catholic event ? There was hardly a joke to it at all ( the embedded joke , such as it was , had to do with emails among Catholic aides , but nothing Clinton had ever said or done ) . It was awful .\nAnd there she sat , smiling , laughing , cool as you please . People ask why she \u2019 s winning , and the usual answer is that Trump is such a catastrophe . And he is , obviously . But I say she \u2019 s winning mainly because she \u2019 s one tough dame . She \u2019 s made of steel . And not Trumpian Chinese steel . And even though she \u2019 s going to face a wall of total resistance from Congress if she \u2019 s president , I say history tells us not to sell this woman short .\nI \u2019 ve seen it for years . I \u2019 ve covered her on and off for 17 years , when she first went up to New York to run for Senate . All these alpha males were supposed to bury her . First , the tabloid New York media ( a metaphorical alpha male ) was supposed to eat her alive . And it took some bites out of her , no doubt about that . Especially Murdoch \u2019 s Post , and especially in those early months of the race , in 1999 , when she kissed Suha Arafat . But in time , she neutralized them . The Post never warmed to her during that campaign , God knows , but the Daily News did ( it endorsed her ) , and she learned how to anticipate the tabs \u2019 rhythms and return their best serves .\nThen Rudy Giuliani was supposed to crush this carpetbagger . He left the race in the spring of 2000 for reasons that didn \u2019 t have anything to do with her . It was about his prostate cancer diagnosis . But by the time he dropped out , she \u2019 d been running a better campaign than he had ( he could hardly be bothered to go upstate ) and she was a couple points up in most polls . You might think he \u2019 d have beaten her in the end , but I can tell you he didn \u2019 t think so : He might deny this now , but he told me himself December 2000 that he didn \u2019 t think he \u2019 d have won , mainly because Al Gore beat George W. Bush by 1.7 million votes in the state , and Rudy didn \u2019 t believe he could have wooed enough ticket-splitters to overcome that . Clinton 2 , alpha males 0 .\nRick Lazio wasn \u2019 t exactly an alpha male , but after he got in the race , Clinton was in an important sense running against the whole vast right-wing conspiracy she had so famously named on the Today show two years before . Tons of national right-wing money was thrown at stopping her , heavyweights came in to campaign against her , and the New York State Republican Party made robocalls linking Clinton to the terrorists who \u2019 d just bombed the USS Cole in Yemen ( yes , they did ; don \u2019 t ask ) . They all thought they could bully her . But in the end it was she who conquered them . They went too far , got hysterical ( imagine if she , a woman , had done that ) . She stayed steady as a rock .\nNext up was Trent Lott , Mississippian , consorter , shall we say , with white supremacist groups , and at the time the Senate majority leader . After Clinton won , he\u2014the leader of the United States Senate , a body that fetishizes decorum , far more so in those days\u2014said : \u201c I tell you one thing , when this Hillary gets to the Senate , if she does\u2014maybe lightning will strike and she won \u2019 t\u2014she will be one of 100 , and we won \u2019 t let her forget it . \u201d\nAnd she ? In the face of the boss at her new workplace wishing that she \u2019 d be struck by lightning , she said nothing and got to work . Within two years , most Republican senators were working with her and marveling that she was a pretty decent human being after all\u2014Sam Brownback once publicly admitted he had hated her and asked for her apology to her face , which she of course graciously accepted . And into the bargain , she was someone who could really hold her liquor . Three-nil .\nOh , there were plenty others , before and since . Back in her first lady days , Ken Starr , and Bill Safire of the Times , and Fred Thompson , and Al D \u2019 Amato , and Michael Chertoff\u2014every one of them was going to bring her down . They \u2019 re now deceased ( Safire ) , disgraced ( Starr ) , retired from public service ( D \u2019 Amato and Thompson ) , or endorsing her ( Chertoff ) . She \u2019 s the one who \u2019 s standing .\nAnd now , she \u2019 s two-plus weeks away from becoming the first woman president of the United States . Imagine what she \u2019 s been through . Some of it , yes , she brought on herself ; the email server , the speeches , some aspects of the foundation story . But most of it has been a cabal of ideologues who \u2019 ve been trying and failing for 25 years to put her in jail .

For the most part I share this view . But I look back over the carcasses she \u2019 s left behind of men who were supposed to dominate her and I think just maybe she \u2019 ll figure something out .\nDonald Trump , who lies when he says \u201c and \u201d and \u201c the , \u201d has said one true thing in these last 16 months .
