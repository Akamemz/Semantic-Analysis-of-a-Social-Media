    "content": "If you \u2019 re a governor and you want to be president , usually you run on a record of achievement . But two such Republican governors , who have both witnessed declining popularity numbers in their states , are smack in the middle of crises caused by their common design to impose on their states \u2019 highly respected universities punishing budget cuts . Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana are eagerly pursuing wider name recognition in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential campaign . They want to be seen as tough-minded conservatives fighting big bureaucracy on behalf of real moms and dads . Is it now patriotic to put roadblocks in the way of building a superior system of public higher education ?\nScott Walker wants to be president . Elected twice in a more or less blue state , he thinks he has built up a personal story that gives him the street cred the \u201c new GOP \u201d gets excited about\u2013you can hear it in his hopeful strains before the state Legislature in addressing a huge new budget deficit : Scott Walker is primed to bring back the \u201c American Dream \u201d to Wisconsin . He likes the idea of mandatory drug tests for people on public assistance . Big dreams , right ?\nIn the gluttonous era of Citizens United , he \u2019 s already gained the attention of the big-money men . His claim to fame is that he took on public sector unions and won , stripping them of their rights . He stood up to the Democrat machine ( so-called ) , avoided a nasty recall vote , and then went on to win reelection . Now , with his state facing a nearly $ 1 billion budget shortfall , the property tax-cutting Walker has proposed a devastating $ 300 million cut in the University of Wisconsin \u2019 s budget . Alarmed , the university \u2019 s chancellor , Rebecca Blank , has called the reduction \u201c too large for the system to absorb . \u201d\nWalker no doubt thinks his act courageously conservative ; he says it \u2019 s about \u201c efficiencies , \u201d and will somehow make UW \u201c stronger. \u201d In a Milwaukee radio interview last week , he ignorantly defended the cuts by claiming that university professors needed to be teaching more classes and , yes , working harder . ( How about drug-tested , while we \u2019 re at it ? ) Meanwhile , as has been widely reported , he aims to spend an amount of state money approximately equal to the university cuts to build a basketball arena . His upside-down logic ? Professors only add daily , and unendingly , to knowledge of the world ; whereas professional hoopsters can be called upon to deliver an extended moment \u2019 s entertainment for all who can afford tickets .\nWhat mind-set leads one to argue that cutting higher education funds ( while calling it \u201c reform \u201d ) strengthens a state ? Is downsizing faculty related , in the conservative lexicon , to the hallowed principle of slashing government bureaucracy ? Seriously , is it ?\nAs for Jindal , after going to London to establish foreign policy credentials , and succeeding only in embarrassing himself with his broad-brush anti-Muslim comments , he came home to speak at the \u201c American Principles Project , \u201d a conservative group seeking influence over public school issues . According to the most recent issue of Education Week , he berated Washington bureaucrats and all those who were twisting the curriculum for the nefarious America-hating purpose of dismissing the very principle of \u201c American exceptionalism . \u201d\nJindal \u2019 s reality-avoiding rhetorical pose is his means of deflecting attention from his failures as an executive . Louisiana now faces a $ 1.6 billion budget shortfall , some $ 300 million of which ( the same number Walker has identified in Wisconsin ) is meant to come out of higher education . With the figures Jindal is proposing , Louisiana State University might well be required to cut up to 40 percent of its operating budget . LSU is already near the bottom of flagship state universities in the amount of spending per student . It is probably unreasonable to hope that the governor will consent to some invisible form of tax increase ( in the most undertaxed of states ) that can be called something else so that his pal Grover Norquist\u2013who wanted Mitt Romney to make Jindal his running mate in 2012\u2013can sleep easily .\nJindal is a bright man who wears his conservatism less comfortably than Walker . Except perhaps for Newt Gingrich , no Republican touts American exceptionalism quite as loudly as Jindal does . He goes overboard in emphasizing his Southernness , his gun-culture affiliations , and ( despite his stint as a Rhodes scholar ) his insistence that everyone ought to homogenize as he did , surrendering all hyphenated identities ( he himself is Indian-American ) to pure Americanism . He has married himself to the politics of fear . To listen to a Jindal speech is to learn that someone is trying to steal your independence by imposing national standards or take your savings and give it to the unworthy . Government is plotting a takeover of education , and , by the way , as he repeats ad nauseam , \u201c elites think they \u2019 re better than you . \u201d\nWhat makes this precocious Ivy Leaguer ( a two-term governor still in his early 40s ) not an elitist isn \u2019 t clear . In his heart of hearts he can not want to damage higher education . But if his national political prospects are aided by a heartless stance at home , there is no telling what Jindal will try to do . It must be said that he wears his hubris awkwardly . As Elias Isquith reported here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the slightly formed governor whose voice can slip into the whine of 30 Rock \u2019 s \u201c Kenneth \u201d began making an effort to put pounds on so as to look like a more substantial national candidate . He wants to be president in order to return power to the states\u2014yet the people of Louisiana are notoriously at or near the bottom of every measure of education , health , and well-being . ( Drawing on FBI crime statistics , the Centers for Disease Control , and other unimpeachable sources , Politico \u2019 s second annual assessment put Louisiana in 50th place . )\nOver two terms , Bobby Jindal has ruined Louisiana while attacking President Obama for maladministering an improving U.S. economy . Like George W. Bush in 2001 , Jindal inherited a big surplus at the time he entered office , and completely squandered it . You have to take in more than you spend\u2013it \u2019 s an easy principle to understand . Reluctant to review his own failures , Jindal broadcast his desire to eliminate all income and corporate taxes , in favor of higher sales taxes . He has done a lot of privatizing , too . Yet in late 2014 , only 21 percent of GOPers in Louisiana said that their governor should seek the presidency\u2013he had , at that point , an approval rating of 32 percent , among the lowest of all U.S. governors , and lower than that of President Obama in the reddest of red states .\nAcademic standards matter . Or should . LSU has a mammoth reputation for its football program . Suppose LSU \u2019 s president shut down football for as long as it took to get the state to equitably support the education of its children . Like Walker and his basketball stadium project , LSU recently completed a multimillion-dollar makeover of its 102,000 seat football stadium . The Romanesque structure stands tall\u2013but will it become Louisiana \u2019 s equivalent of Rome \u2019 s Coliseum , a grand monument that survives while the surrounding community is burnt to the ground ?\nIt is ironic , to say the least , that the party of \u201c family values \u201d is so willing to throw its children under the proverbial bus . We live in a time when football coaches earn more than the President of the United States . All the big college football programs , as Steven Salzberg wrote in Forbes in 2011 , provide \u201c free training for the super-wealthy owners of professional football teams , while getting little in return. \u201d Govs . Scott and Jindal have seemingly forgotten that the purpose of every university is to educate and empower a rising generation of good citizens , to fund valuable research , and to teach the tools that support economic growth .\nAnd what \u2019 s football by comparison ? Beyond life-altering head trauma concerns , the small numbers who actually receive the useful college education they theoretically signed up for should make all shudder . Maybe university presidents should hold their football programs hostage . Non-educational activities ought not to prosper when a fine university is under threat of sinking into the lower ranks of academic standing because of a dependence on irresponsible state leaders for education funding . No family education , then no family entertainment . High academic standards have to be priority one .\nSo , what makes a Jindal think he is a man of good ideas who is needed to rescue the nation from whatever is supposed to be ailing it that liberals inflicted ? How is Jindal \u2019 s Louisiana achievement a bright mirror of what he could do for America ? What has his shrinking of government done to improve anyone \u2019 s life ? And what makes Scott Walker believe he is equipped to direct the entire United States economy ? Who is telling these charisma-resistant guys to run for president , and what planet do they live on ?",
