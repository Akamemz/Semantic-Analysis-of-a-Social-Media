    "content": "Despite his populist rhetoric on the campaign trail , Donald Trump revealed with his proposal for the federal budget that he 's actually just a hyper-conservative Republican that wants to starve the poor so the rich can build mansions for their dogs . The White House 's budget , released on Tuesday , recommends $ 4.1 trillion in spending cuts , mainly for social services .\nOffice of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney tried to spin these cuts as a form of compassion , arguing that people need to look `` at the budget through the eyes of the taxpayer '' and that they measure compassion `` by the number of people we help get off of those [ social ] programs . ''\nThe problem is that these cuts do n't just hurt people in immediate need of government assistance to survive . Conservatives spin this story about an unfair system where a bunch of lazy welfare cheats live off government largesse while hard-working Americans are forced to foot the bill . But the reality is that drastic cuts to social spending will do serious damage to the prospects of working people and to the economy at large . If the goal is to help working people do better \u2014 as opposed to helping rich people buy diamond-encrusted water bowls for their dogs \u2014 then it 's critical to keep fully funding programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) , better known as food stamps .\n`` When you give people money to spend on food or to go out to get health care , then that money is directly being spent on the economy , '' explained Kate Bahn , an economist for the Center for American Progress , in a phone conversation .\nConservatives have long argued for `` trickle-down '' economics , saying that hefty tax cuts for the rich will lead to more investment and more jobs . Instead , it tends to lead to more conspicuous and gratuitous consumption . And yes , some rich people really do send their dogs on luxury overseas vacations .\n`` In reality , economic growth in the United States since World War II has tended to be greater in times with relatively high top marginal income tax rates , '' policy analysts Alexandra Thornton and Harry Stein wrote in a 2015 paper for the Center for American Progress , citing multiple studies analyzing the relationship between tax rates and economic growth .\nMedicaid and food-stamp money , however , goes directly back into the economy , and into sectors far more useful to the general public than the washing-your-dog-in-Champagne industry : The health care , retail and agriculture industries .\nAs Sarah Kliff of the Washington Post reported in 2012 , Medicaid spending has a powerful economic effect , causing job growth , higher wages and increased tax revenue for states . Food stamps also contribute to the economy , to the tune of $ 9 in economic growth for every $ 5 spent on food stamps , according to research done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Even Americans who never receive a dime in Medicaid or SNAP will benefit from all this economic growth .\nWhat 's noteworthy is that the most affected industries just happen to provide the same kinds of working-class jobs that candidate Donald Trump promised to restore and protect . Every $ 1 billion spent on SNAP , for instance , results in 9,000 jobs , largely in the agriculture and food production sectors . The Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act caused an explosion in health care employment .\nBut as economist Kate Bahn emphasized during our conversation , there are even more hidden benefits to the labor market from social spending , and Medicaid in particular .\nThere \u2019 s good evidence that expanding Medicaid , as was done with the Affordable Care Act , improved people \u2019 s employment prospects and helped them build a better economic future , Bahn explained .\nHaving access to Medicaid can help people avoid what Bahn called `` job lock , '' where they stay with unfulfilling or under-paying jobs for fear of losing adequate health insurance and health care .\n\u201c When they knew they could count on having Medicaid , \u201d Bahn said , people were more likely to `` take risks in the labor market '' and invest in their careers . This `` isn \u2019 t only good for you as an individual , because you earn more money , '' she continued , `` it \u2019 s also good for the overall labor market if people are moving around . \u201d\nWhen workers have more flexibility and choice , she explained , that leads overall to more economic productivity .\nBahn also expressed concern about the negative effects on the labor market from Trump 's proposal to bar women who use Medicaid or Title X family planning programs from going to Planned Parenthood clinics .\n\u201c In these really crucial years of their working life from ages 18 to 45 , \u201d she said , not being able to control when you get pregnant or give birth `` can have pretty major negative consequences on women workers . ''\nResearch has repeatedly demonstrated that women 's economic prospects improve if they have control over their reproduction . In 2013 , researchers at the Guttmacher Institute collected the immense body of research on this subject and found that contraception access helped narrow the gender pay gap , improved women 's participation in the workforce and helped women go further in their careers because they could better plan their education and career path . While it 's difficult to predict how many women will lose access to contraception under the Trump plan , 2017 research by the Guttmacher suggests there are n't nearly enough alternate providers to make up for the loss .\nMost Americans probably do n't think of themselves as beneficiaries of federal welfare programs , and therefore do n't believe these cuts to health care and food assistance will affect them .
