Not only can we live with that , but we should celebrate it .\nWhen the liberals and their squishy-soft allies in Conservative , Inc. , start moaning about your dreadful incivility , that \u2019 s a clear indicator that you are doing something right and that you need to double down . Civility , once properly understood as a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself , has morphed from an aspiration into a political/cultural gimp suit designed to prevent you from effectively asserting your interests and your point of view .\nFor liberals , civility is a grift \u2013 they think it \u2019 s a punchline and they \u2019 re waiting to laugh at you for embracing it . It \u2019 s a way to keep you from interrupting their non-stop attacks on your rights , your faith , and your dignity by convincing you that it \u2019 s somehow wrong to get upset when , say , some Astroturf Tot backed up by a bunch of leftist Red Guard orgs like Planned Parenthood and Move On starts shrieking that you have blood on your hands .\nFor the Fredocons , civility is just an excuse for lounging on the Lido Deck while those of us not signed onto Team Submissive wade in and fight . It \u2019 s also an excuse to push back against the revolt of the Normals that their incompetent , self-serving bumbling created . They will never , ever attack the progressive cultural aggressors , those leftist savages spewing their death wishes against conservatives while saving the grossest sexual slurs for the brave female warriors whose will not back down in the face of progressive hate . Your refusal to knuckle under shames the sissycons .\nNo , they will attack you when you resist . It \u2019 s unseemly to fight back , according to some True Conservative Principle\u2122 we never heard of but that they insist is the central tenet of conservatism . Not giving in is not who we are , or something .\nDon \u2019 t fail to get undone because maybe some of your allies failed to meet standards of propriety society tossed out the window two decades ago .\nYeah , we \u2019 re done with their version of civility because their version of civility is a lie too . George W. Bush was civil , oh so civil , or so dignified . He was so civil and dignified that we got eight years of Barack Obama and we came that close to going under forever . But funny how Dignified George \u2019 s civility lasted for only eight years of his pal/successor then vanished once the guy who beat his soft bro to a pulp showed up and took what was supposed to be one of the Bipartisan Civility Crew \u2019 s gig . Suddenly , when someone who wasn \u2019 t part of the Approved Elite got elected , George found his ability to attack again . Of course , it was his own ( supposed ) side .\nBush was not just attacking Trump . He was attacking us Normals for daring to elect Trump . Many of us defended him when he was busy being oh-so-dignified and civil . And when we defied him and his class , he turned against us . Like a true gentleman .\nCivility is a component of a system of reasoned debate , not its end product . Civility is necessary in a system where people reason in good faith in order to come to the best solution to the policy challenges facing them . Civility lubricates that process , and allows people of good faith to disagree without engendering unnecessary and destructive discord .\nThe problem is that progressives are not people of good faith .\nThey are not trying to reason . They are not trying to compromise . They do not accept the basic concept that all American citizens have inalienable rights and that the law must apply equally to everyone . They hate us .\nWe are sub-human , unworthy of courtesy or respect . We have no rights ; they might allow us some control over our personal lives , for now , but we exist at their sufferance . That \u2019 s their view . That \u2019 s their basic premise \u2013 and if you ever go on social media they will tell you . So it \u2019 s no wonder that they feel no need to be civil .\nWake up . The truth is ugly , but it \u2019 s still the truth .\nThe hallmark of adulthood is putting away childish things , like the Pollyanna view that others must always be acting in good faith because we really , really want that to be true . Luckily , many of us have rejected the illusions and embraced the truth . And truth is more important than civility .\nThe rational system that incorporated civility as a central component no longer exists . Why should we preserve that one aspect of the whole when the other side has gleefully tossed the rest into the bonfire ? Because it \u2019 s nice ? We \u2019 re not interested in nice .
