    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: New Email Leak Reveals Clinton Campaign\u2019s Cozy Press Relationship",
    "date": "2016-10-09",
    "authors": "",
    "content": "Internal strategy documents and emails among Clinton staffers shed light on friendly and highly useful relationships between the campaign and various members of the U.S. media , as well as the campaign \u2019 s strategies for manipulating those relationships . The emails were provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by the source identifying himself as Guccifer 2.0 , who was reportedly responsible for prior significant hacks , including one that targeted the Democratic National Committee and resulted in the resignations of its top four officials . On Friday , Obama administration officials claimed that Russia \u2019 s \u201c senior-most officials \u201d were responsible for that hack and others , although they provided no evidence for that assertion . As these internal documents demonstrate , a central component of the Clinton campaign strategy is ensuring that journalists they believe are favorable to Clinton are tasked to report the stories the campaign wants circulated .\nAt times , Clinton \u2019 s campaign staff not only internally drafted the stories they wanted published but even specified what should be quoted \u201c on background \u201d and what should be described as \u201c on the record. \u201d One January 2015 strategy document \u2014 designed to plant stories on Clinton \u2019 s decision-making process about whether to run for president \u2014 singled out reporter Maggie Haberman , then of Politico , now covering the election for the New York Times , as a \u201c friendly journalist \u201d who has \u201c teed up \u201d stories for them in the past and \u201c never disappointed \u201d them . Nick Merrill , the campaign press secretary , produced the memo , according to the document metadata :\nThat strategy document plotted how Clinton aides could induce Haberman to write a story on the thoroughness and profound introspection involved in Clinton \u2019 s decision-making process . The following month , when she was at the Times , Haberman published two stories on Clinton \u2019 s vetting process ; in this instance , Haberman \u2019 s stories were more sophisticated , nuanced , and even somewhat more critical than what the Clinton memo envisioned . But they nonetheless accomplished the goal Clinton campaign aides wanted to fulfill of casting the appearance of transparency on Clinton \u2019 s vetting process in a way that made clear she was moving carefully but inexorably toward a presidential run . Given more than 24 hours to challenge the authenticity of these documents and respond , Merrill did not reply to our emails . Haberman declined to comment . Other documents listed those whom the campaign regarded as their most reliable \u201c surrogates \u201d \u2014 such as CNN \u2019 s Hilary Rosen and Donna Brazile , as well as Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden \u2014 but then also listed operatives whom they believed were either good \u201c progressive helpers \u201d or more potentially friendly media figures who might be worth targeting with messaging . The metadata of the surrogate document shows the file was authored by Jennifer Palmieri , the communications director of the campaign . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 previously reported , pundits regularly featured on cable news programs were paid by the Clinton campaign without any disclosure when they appeared ; several of them are included on this \u201c surrogates \u201d list , including Stephanie Cutter and Maria Cardona :\nThe Clinton campaign likes to use glitzy , intimate , completely off-the-record parties between top campaign aides and leading media personalities . One of the most elaborately planned get-togethers was described in an April , 2015 , memo \u2014 produced , according to the document metadata , by deputy press secretary Jesse Ferguson \u2014 to take place shortly before Clinton \u2019 s official announcement of her candidacy . The event was an April 10 cocktail party for leading news figures and top-level Clinton staff at the Upper East Side home of Clinton strategist Joel Benenson , a fully off-the-record gathering designed to impart the campaign \u2019 s messaging :\nA separate email chain between Clinton staff ( one that was not among those provided by Guccifer 2.0 but appeared on the DCLeaks.com site earlier this week ) contains plans for a separate off-the-record media get-together in May .
