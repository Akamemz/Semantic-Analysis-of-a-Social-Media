Similar trainings are scheduled in New Mexico and El Paso .\nThe idea , organizers said , is to give immigrants guidance on how to legitimately push back against attempts to detain them , mostly using tactics designed to keep agents from learning anything they do n't already know . The government ca n't deport someone unless they can prove they are in the U.S. illegally .\nAt a training session Tuesday in Queens , a little more than two dozen people sat in a room listening to Yaritza Mendez , an outreach coordinator at the pro-immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York . She spoke about various ways ICE agents can find a person , and what to do if they come knocking .\nEven people in the country illegally have constitutional rights , Mendez said , such as not being subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures , not answering questions and not signing any documents without speaking with an attorney .\nVolunteers took part in a role-playing exercise . The audience broke into laughter when a woman wearing a vest with `` ICE '' taped on it burst into the room after knocking loudly on a door .\n`` I try to make it interactive because it 's long and very sad , in a way , '' Mendez said .\nA lady sitting at the back had a question . If immigration officials knocked on her door , what if she opened it a crack but kept the chain on ?\nNo , Mendez said . Not even a crack . That 's guidance that closely mirrors something criminal defense attorneys have long been telling clients . Letting a law enforcement agent peek inside could give them the probable cause they need to enter without a warrant .\nOther advice dispensed during the session : Make sure any warrants presented have the right name and addresses and are signed by a judge .
