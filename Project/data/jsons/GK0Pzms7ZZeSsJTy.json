( Carlos Barria/Reuters )\nIn an interview , Joe Biden \u2019 s accuser expressed outrage that Democratic politicians had not given her Biden allegations a fair hearing .\nNRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE A s someone who spent her career working for Democratic politicians and advocating liberal causes , Tara Reade was shocked by the treatment she \u2019 s received from her co-partisans since publicly accusing Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her when she worked as a staff assistant in his office in 1993 .\nReade , 56 , claims that in the spring or summer of 1993 , a senior staffer told her to meet Biden in a Capitol corridor to deliver a duffel bag . While there , she says , Biden forced her against the wall and penetrated her with his fingers . She first made the allegation during a podcast with political reporter Katie Halper last month and has since described the alleged ordeal in interviews with the New York Times , the Washington Post , and Business Insider .\nReade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a Tuesday phone interview that , since coming forward , she \u2019 s been subjected to \u201c shocking \u201d treatment from those she had expected to come to her aid : the very people who championed a woman \u2019 s \u201c right \u201d to be believed during the Kavanaugh confirmation episode two years prior , which Reade confirmed she followed at the time .\nBiden \u2019 s guilt has by no means been established . But the candidate himself has yet to be asked about the allegation at all \u2014 despite sitting for interviews with a host of prominent reporters over the past month . His campaign spokeswoman has re-upped a single categorical denial when asked for comment following each new development .\nTwo women , one a former neighbor and the other a former coworker , recently told Business Insider that Reade described the incident in separate conversations two years after it allegedly occurred . Reade \u2019 s brother and one friend have also said she told them about the assault soon after it happened . But other former Biden staffers , including several that Reade says she had told about the incident , have denied her account .\nReade initially claimed in 2019 that Biden had touched her back and neck in a way that made her feel uncomfortable , but she didn \u2019 t say anything about sexual assault .
