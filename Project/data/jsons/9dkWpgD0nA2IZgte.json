    "content": "The Washington Post editors refuse to publicly release the smoking gun \u201c anonymous letter \u201d that serves as the foundation of their sensational charge that White House advisor Jared Kushner sought a secret , back-channel to Russian officials .\nThe \u201c anonymous letter \u201d was part of a front-page article claiming the president \u2019 s son-in-law sought to set up a private communications channel to Russian officials during a discussion with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak . The piece was published Sunday and received high profile coverage throughout the long Memorial Day weekend .\n\u201c The Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter , which said , among other things , that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel , \u201d the article \u2019 s three authors stated .\nWaPo also claimed American intelligence agencies discovered the ploy through an intercepted open phone call by Kislyak to Moscow . Observers have noted that Kislyak , a seasoned spy , made the phone call on an \u201c open line , \u201d and therefore knew it was likely to be intercepted .\nTo date , there has been no independent verification the letter is real or that WaPo \u2019 s description of its contents is accurate . The Washington Post editors also never explain why they withheld the letter .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation \u2019 s Investigative Group contacted The Post \u2019 s national desk over the weekend , seeking a copy of the letter and an explanation why their editors withheld it from the public . WaPo did not reply to either TheDCNF \u2019 s email or phone inquiries .\nThe story is weakened further since its reporters only cite unnamed government officials to confirm the anonymous letter \u2019 s charges .\nWaPo stated the letter \u2019 s allegations were affirmed by unnamed officials \u201c who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence . \u201d\nAs a general rule , TheDCNF does not post documents if it endangers genuine whistleblowers , ongoing law enforcement or military operations , human life , or public safety .\nOtherwise , TheDCNF emphasizes openness and transparency , which is especially important for original source documents related to its articles . And if it does not publicly link a document , it explicitly explains to readers the reasons why it has not released a key document .\nThe Post \u2019 s secrecy has produced its doubters . Over the weekend , Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , who serves on the Senate Committees on Armed Services and the Judiciary , said he believed The Post \u2019 s account was bogus .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t trust this story as far as I can throw it , \u201d the South Carolina Republican said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nGraham , who served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence between 2007 to 2009 , doubted the Russian Ambassador would transmit the Kushner proposal via an open line , saying it \u201c made no sense \u201d since Kislyak would know U.S. intelligence authorities were monitoring the communication .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know who leaked this information , but just think about it this way \u2014 you \u2019 ve got the ambassador of Russia reporting back to Moscow on an open channel , \u2018 Hey , Jared Kushner \u2019 s going to move into the embassy , ' \u201d Graham said on CNN .\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova told TheDCNF other unreleased parts of the letter could undermine the credibility of the author and discredit the allegations about Kushner .\n\u201c Here \u2019 s the problem : we don \u2019 t know what else is in the letter . The letter may be so outrageous in its claims that if we read it all , it would throw doubt onto this particular allegation . And it may very well be that the letter is so scurrilous and outrageous that they won \u2019 t release it because it will make them look bad for relying on it at all , \u201d he told TheDCNF in an interview .\nTom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch , a nonpartisan government watchdog group dedicated to openness and transparency , said he thought there could be references that show the letter \u2019 s author had a partisan agenda , which WaPo reporters wanted to hide .\n\u201c Are they coloring their documents in any way ? \u201d he asked during an interview with TheDCNF . \u201c The way you figure that out is whether they disclose their politics or their agendas . We don \u2019 t know if the characterization of the underlying documents is accurate or if it \u2019 s being slanted . \u201d\nFormer Air Force Col. James Waurishuk , a senior intelligence and political-military affairs advisor who served on the National Security Council and worked with news organizations , told TheDCNF journalistic integrity has evaporated in Washington .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been turning the corner for some time on journalistic integrity .
