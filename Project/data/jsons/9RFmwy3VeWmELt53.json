    "content": "Rather than striking immunity deals with virtually every person who had intimate knowledge of Hillary Clinton 's illegal private server and emails , the Justice Department would have saved everyone some time by offering Clinton protection instead .\nFBI Director James Comey , who testified in front of two congressional committees this week , still maintains that he was unable to recommend that the DOJ charge Clinton with mishandling classified documents because of insufficient evidence proving `` intent '' \u2014although the actions themselves are irrefutably illegal .\nWell , how exactly did he anticipate gathering this proof , when the DOJ had proactively shielded the five people tasked with setting up the private system and then destroying it ? Was he hoping to extract a confession directly from Clinton ?\nWhy would , for instance , a Clinton functionary like Cheryl Mills help prosecutors once she 'd already secured safeguards against any criminal prosecution ?

A lawyer for Mills and Heather Samuelson , another one of the five , had already admitted the deal was struck to protect her clients from potential prosecution arising from `` classification '' on their laptops . Apparently , the DOJ was more convinced of their innocence than their lawyer was .\nIn the FBI 's summary statement , Mills alleged that she did n't know about Clinton 's email server until after the secretary of state 's tenure was over . Emails since uncovered , however , show this to be untrue . Remember also that , President Obama claimed that he first learned about Clinton 's illegal server through `` news reports . '' If that 's true , why did he email Clinton on her private server under a pseudonym ?\nComey admitted Wednesday that one of Clinton 's lawyers\u2014 '' it might have been Cheryl Mills '' \u2014told Paul Combetta , Clinton 's IT specialist , to delete email files from Clinton 's secret server only days after Congress ordered them to be preserved . And Comey assures us that none of this is obstruction of justice .\nThen , at another point , he told the committee that the DOJ agreed to give immunity because the FBI did n't feel like wrangling with lawyers for years . `` The FBI judgment was we need to get to that laptop .

''\nAnd why is Comey , who does n't `` give a hoot about politics , '' concerned about timetables , rather than making the best case ? If the laptop was important enough to hasten a deal that protected a potential witness from prosecution , why was n't it important enough for the FBI to subpoena ? If Mills ' lawyer is worried about potential criminality , why take a plea bargain off the table ? Is this how it works for everyone ?\nIt was rather amazing to hear Comey concede that the DOJ 's immunity spree was `` unusual . '' More unusual , perhaps , was that three of the people with those deals still ended up taking the Fifth , and another did n't even bother showing up when Congress called him . It 's also unusual that a high-profile case featuring numerous immunity deals resulted in no charges .\nTo Comey , it was also `` very unusual '' that the FBI would conduct an interview with the target of an investigation\u2014where wholly innocent Clinton was surrounded by nine lawyers\u2014with two of the immunized witnesses in the case present .
