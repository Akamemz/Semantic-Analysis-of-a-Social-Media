Below is a list of why some Republicans are wary at the Democratic response so far , and why Mr. Trump may have a point .\n1 . Wiretapping was essential in retrieving the conversations of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador , which led to Gen. Flynn \u2019 s resignation as Mr. Trump \u2019 s national security adviser .\nAccording to The New York Times : \u201c Mr . Flynn , who served in the job for less than a month , said he had given \u2018 incomplete information \u2019 regarding a telephone call he had with the [ Russian ] ambassador in late December about American sanctions against Russia , weeks before President Trump \u2019 s inauguration . \u201d\nHow was it discovered that Mr. Flynn gave this \u201c incomplete information ? \u201d Because either a transcript or actual recording of the call were overheard by FBI officials and leaked to reporters .\nIt \u2019 s unclear whether the FBI \u2014 which uses Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrants to eavesdrop \u2014 had tapped the Russian Ambassador \u2019 s phone or Mr. Flynn \u2019 s . This is because \u2026\n2 . On Oct. 15 , 2016 , the BBC reported that the U.S. secret intelligence court issued a warrant to investigate two Russian banks in conjunction with the Trump Organization .\nThe BBC report was corroborated by Heat Street , which reported the \u201c FBI sought , and was granted , a FISA court warrant in October , giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of \u2018 U.S . persons \u2019 in Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign with ties to Russia . \u201d\nHowever , The New York Times and The Washington Post \u2014 along with other mainstream outlets \u2014 haven \u2019 t been able to confirm . But they \u2019 ve gotten close .\nAccording to The New York Times : \u201c In the fall , the FBI examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank , one of Russia \u2019 s biggest banks , whose owners have long-standing ties to Mr. [ Vladimir ] Putin . While some FBI officials initially believed that the computer activity indicated an encrypted channel between Moscow and New York , the bureau ultimately moved away from that view . The activity remains unexplained . \u201d\nThere is no confirmed evidence \u2014 other than the BBC and Heat Street reports \u2014 that the FBI got a court warrant to get a wiretap on the Trump Organization or to target specific individuals within Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign , like Mr. Flynn .\nBut no confirmed evidence , doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s not out there , just waiting to be exposed by more mainstream outlets .\n3 . Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has lied about U.S. surveillance and wiretapping under oath .\nMr. Clapper offered a full-throated denial of any wiretapping on Trump Tower on Sunday . However , he also denied , under oath and in front of Congress , the scope of the National Security Agency \u2019 s surveillance of the American people .\nIn an exchange with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden in March 2013 , Mr. Clapper was asked \u2014 in a yes-or-no question \u2014 \u201c Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions , or hundreds of millions of Americans ? \u201d\nMr. Clapper responded : \u201c Not wittingly . There are cases where they could inadvertently , perhaps , collect , but not wittingly . \u201d\nIn June , NSA leaker Edward Snowden \u2019 s dump of information revealed the government was in fact doing just that . Later , when asked what triggered Mr. Snowden into releasing the information , he responded it was Mr. Clapper \u2019 s 2013 testimony , where he \u201c directly lie [ d ] under oath to Congress \u2026 seeing that really meant for me there was no going back . \u201d\nIf he lied back then , why couldn \u2019 t he be lying today ?\nMr. Obama \u2019 s statement just said that neither he or the White House ordered the wiretapping \u2014 not that Mr. Trump \u2019 s organization wasn \u2019 t tapped .\nHere \u2019 s Mr. Obama \u2019 s statement : \u201c A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice . As part of that practice , neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen . Any suggestion otherwise is simply false . \u201d\nDavid French , at the National Review , pointed out three ways that this non-denial was disingenuous .

The real question is whether Mr. Obama sought such authorization .\nSecondly , Mr. Obama has ordered surveillance against American citizens . Mr. French argues , \u201c The notion that Obama would never have an American subject to surveillance is absurd. \u201d He cites drone strikes overseas .\nLastly , FISA national security investigations are different than criminal investigations , in that they \u2019 re covert and require a presidential sign-off .\nAs Mr. French notes : \u201c One of the points in FISA proceedings \u2019 being classified is that they remain secret \u2013 the idea is not to prejudice an American citizen with publication of the fact that he has been subjected to surveillance even though he is not alleged to have engaged in criminal wrongdoing . \u201d\n4 .
