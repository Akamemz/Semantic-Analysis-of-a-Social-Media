    "content": "In a speech today at NYU 's Stern Business School , Hillary Clinton plans to finger what she considers a key impediment to long-term economic growth : `` quarterly capitalism . '' It 's a brand of excessively short-term thinking in which Wall Street considerations end up doing too much to drive Main Street business decisions .\nIt 's an intriguing way to drive a conceptually left-wing message that many business executives actually agree with , and a demonstration that there 's no necessary tension between a progressive economic approach focused on fairness and a more centrist one focused on growth .\nIt also reveals the deeply wonky side of Clinton . The supporting policy details that her campaign has hinted at thus far \u2014 a change to the tax code 's definition of long-term capital gains , a new approach to sharing buyback transparency , and perhaps some limits on the things so-called `` activist '' investors are allowed to do \u2014 are not exactly candy for the masses . They 're an effort to grapple with some deep and profound issues about the nature of the American economic system .\nThe term comes from McKinsey & Company managing director Dominic Barton and some ideas he laid out in a March 2011 Harvard Business Review article , but the basic concept is much older . It stems from the ritual through which publicly traded companies release a statement about revenue and spending every three months , known as the quarterly earning report .\nThese statements can have very large influences on share prices . For example , on the afternoon of July 23 Amazon released an earnings report that performed well above the consensus expectations of Wall Street analysts .
