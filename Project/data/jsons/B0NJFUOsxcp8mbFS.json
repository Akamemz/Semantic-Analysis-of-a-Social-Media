    "content": "Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh lied during his Senate testimony on Thursday . He lied about all sorts of things : his drinking habits , the meaning of crude terms on his yearbook page like \u201c boofing , \u201d and even about what other named witnesses to his alleged assault of Christine Blasey Ford have said about the night in question . The lies are well-documented , the evidence of them extraordinarily strong .\nI \u2019 ve become obsessed with this question since the hearing , wondering how anyone could have watched the same hearing I did and conclude that Kavanaugh did not lie under oath . Sure , some of those people are hackish partisans , willing to look past a little light perjury to get a fifth vote on the bench . But not every conservative is like that : Some of Kavanaugh \u2019 s most vociferous defenders , like National Review \u2019 s David French , are thoughtful people expressing their good-faith opinions .\nI couldn \u2019 t get a good handle on this until I read a paper by three scholars \u2014 Carnegie Mellon \u2019 s Oliver Hahl , Northwestern \u2019 s Minjae Kim , and MIT \u2019 s Ezra Zuckerman-Sivan \u2014 on how voters could recognize that a politician is lying but consider them authentic and appealing .\nUsing both a large-scale survey and a lab experiment , Hahl and his colleagues demonstrate that people are shockingly willing to look past lies from someone who they feel represents their group . Instead , the lies are seen in the broader context of what supporters see as a \u201c deeper truth \u201d \u2014 in this case , that Kavanaugh is an innocent target of a Democratic smear campaign .\nIf I was traipsed in front of the Senate on bogus charges and forced to answer deeply personal and embarrassing questions about my high school antics , maybe out of embarrassment and anger I might be less than truthful . Would that make me a liar who ca n't be trusted again ? Come on \u2014 Matt Walsh ( @ MattWalshBlog ) September 29 , 2018\n\u201c As with Trump , the deeper truth is that a particular group is treated unfairly by the establishment ( recall Kavanaugh \u2019 s opening ) , \u201d Zuckerman-Sivan wrote in a Twitter thread . \u201c So long as the obvious lies can be framed as serving that larger truth , the liar can present himself as the group \u2019 s \u2018 authentic champion . \u2019 \u201d\nKavanaugh is using lying as a deliberate tactic to advance his Supreme Court nomination . It \u2019 s a clever manipulation of conservative grievance politics \u2014 and one that seems to be working .\nIn their research , Hahl et al . surveyed 402 Americans about one of Trump \u2019 s most notoriously false statements : that global warming is a hoax invented by China to hurt the US economy . Interestingly , only a handful of Trump supporters in the sample ( 5.8 percent ) described the statement as \u201c highly true. \u201d Most ( 68.8 ) described it as \u201c highly false . \u201d\nBut this didn \u2019 t cause them to conclude that Trump was a liar . Instead , they justified the lying as part of Trump \u2019 s populist appeal .\n\u201c Trump voters were significantly more likely to justify the lie as a form of symbolic protest , \u201d the researchers wrote . They were \u201c much more likely to think the statement \u2018 was his way of challenging the elite establishment \u2019 than to see the statement as true . \u201d\nTo probe this effect even further , Hahl and the other researchers conducted two experiments on separate random samples of 400-odd individuals . In each experiment , the people were sorted into an arbitrary social group and then were asked their opinions about a hypothetical college campus election involving a student who belongs to that same group .\nThe main issue in this hypothetical student election was \u2014 in something of a coincidence \u2014 alcohol \u2019 s role in sexual assault . One of the candidates in this hypothetical election was defending a ban on campus drinking to reduce sexual violence , while the other opposed it .\nWhen people were told that the anti-ban candidate was lying about a study documenting the link between alcohol and sexual assault , they were more likely to rate the candidate highly on a measure of \u201c authenticity \u201d if they were the member of the same social group . They were especially likely to do so if they were told that alcohol consumption was an important social tradition at the college , and that the people trying to curtail it were gaining support among the university \u2019 s leadership .\nSo under these conditions , in fact , people were likely to view the candidate \u2019 s lies positively : their willingness to say things that the establishment was trying to keep hidden is a sign of authenticity . The establishment , in the experiment , was siding with anti-sexual assault crusaders against the university \u2019 s traditional social hierarchy .\nThis is what Hahl et al . call \u201c the authentic appeal of the lying demagogue \u201d : the idea that lying is not only acceptable but seen as a sign of a certain kind of honesty , if done in service of a traditional group under threat from an upstart social movement .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that these aggrieved traditionalists ignore the lies . They recognize lies as such in our experiments , \u201d Zuckerman-Sivan explained in his tweets . \u201c It \u2019 s just that they see these lies as a tool for expressing a larger truth . \u201d\nThe application of this study to the Kavanaugh case is quite clear . Here , conservatives are lining up to defend their nominee to be the fifth vote on the Supreme Court against allegations of sexual assault . It \u2019 s a defense of social group and status hierarchy against an upstart challenger , just like in the study . This is what made his fiery opening testimony so effective , at least for conservatives : It appealed to their sense of in-group threat and partisan identity .\nWhat \u2019 s more , the rhetoric conservatives are using about Kavanaugh \u2019 s lies line up neatly with what Hahl would predict . Here \u2019 s what French , the National Review writer , argued in a Monday post :\nIf you follow Twitter closely , you \u2019 ll notice that the debate over Brett Kavanaugh moved significantly from the central question of last Thursday \u2019 s hearing \u2014 did he commit sexual assault ? \u2014 to a raging debate over whether he lied about high-school slang , college drinking , and inside jokes , and whether he was just too \u201c angry \u201d to be a Supreme Court judge . This torrent of commentary ( most of it silly , including competing , furious arguments about how people described anal sex in 1982 ) obscures an important development : The sexual-assault claims against Kavanaugh are in a state of collapse .\nThis isn \u2019 t an affirmative defense \u2014 an argument that Kavanaugh is telling the truth about what a \u201c Devil \u2019 s Triangle \u201d is , or whether he ever blacked out from drinking . It \u2019 s a dismissal of the relevance of those lies in light of what French sees as a larger truth : that the sexual assault allegations are false .\nKavanaugh \u2019 s supporters believe him , so much so that the literal truth of his testimony is no longer considered to be important . Conservatives , to borrow a phrase famously coined to describe President Trump \u2019 s supporters , are taking Brett Kavanaugh seriously but not literally .\nThere are a few problems with this attitude . First of all , the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh are not \u201c in a state of collapse , \u201d as French claims . There have been no major factual revelations about Ford \u2019 s allegations since Thursday \u2019 s hearings , and the same is true for Deborah Ramirez \u2019 s accusation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her in college . ( Julie Swetnick might be another story . ) If you believed Ford and Ramirez before this weekend , you \u2019 d still believe them now .\nMoreover , there is no way to disentangle the petty lies from the bigger truths in the way French suggests . Kavanaugh \u2019 s lies were all told with the purpose of airbrushing his image as a high school student , when the incident with Ford was alleged to have happened . The little details Kavanaugh lied about \u2014 \u201c boofing , \u201d \u201c ralphing , \u201d blacking out \u2014 aimed to paint a picture of him as being incapable of the act he was accused of committing . They weren \u2019 t trivial misstatements ; they actually matter , and speak his overall credibility relative to Ford \u2019 s .\nFinally , and perhaps most importantly : He lied under oath . Supreme Court justices are supposed to be the ultimate arbiters of the law , not willing to casually lie under oath in a way that some legal analysts suggest could well meet the standard for perjury .\nThis should be really disturbing in and of itself , a whole new category of scandal for Kavanaugh . But conservatives can not seem to recognize this because they \u2019 re committed to larger truths : that they are the real victims in America and Brett Kavanaugh deserves a seat on the Supreme Court .",
