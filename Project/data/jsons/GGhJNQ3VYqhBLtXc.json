Pope Francis is a doctrinal conservative like his predecessors Benedict XVI and John Paul II . Where he may make his mark is in his personal commitment to issues of inequality , including poverty and globalization , as well as in tapping his outsider status at the Vatican to promote reform .\nHis modest manner \u2013 as Archbishop of Buenos Aires he traveled by bus and eschewed the episcopal palace in favor of a small apartment \u2013 also raises the prospect of a radical culture clash with the pomp and circumstance of the Vatican , which is matched only by the British royal family for its love of costume , ceremony , and tradition .\nThere is an expectation that the first non-European pope for nearly 1,300 years and the first pontiff from the Americas could clear up the intrigue-ridden Curia , the powerful governing body of the Holy See .\n`` Revolution at St. Peter 's '' said a headline in La Repubblica , with the Italian daily greeting Mr. Bergoglio \u2019 s election as the expression of a `` geographic and cultural upheaval '' for the Vatican .\nBergoglio 's election is being interpreted as a victory for reform-minded cardinals \u2013 prominent among them Americans such as Timothy Dolan of New York and Sean O \u2019 Malley of Boston \u2013 who were dismayed by the allegations of corruption and feuding in the Curia that emerged from the Vatileaks scandal last year , when Pope Benedict \u2019 s butler was caught stealing and leaking confidential documents .\nIt was a defeat for Odilo Scherer , the Archbishop of S\u00e3o Paolo in Brazil , who was the favored candidate of a bloc of cardinals , many of them Italian and working inside the Curia , who were highly resistant to reform , Vatican-watchers said .\nThe fact that Pope Francis is a Jesuit also may herald sweeping changes to the Holy See .
