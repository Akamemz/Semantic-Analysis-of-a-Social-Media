    "content": "Eight years ago , it was Hillary Clinton who was accusing candidate Barack Obama of being swayed by his financial backers , including his connections with Tony Rezko , a fundraiser who was imprisoned for his role in \u201c pay-to-play \u201d schemes involving former Illinois Gov . Rod Blagojevich .\nMrs. Clinton now finds herself in the crosshairs of those same accusations but insists there is no fire behind all the smoke rising from the Clinton Foundation .\nHer campaign says it \u2019 s ridiculous to think donations to the Clinton family \u2019 s massive charity were enough to earn access to the secretary in the State Department .\nCampaign finance analysts and watchdogs , though , said the parallels between her criticism of Mr. Obama in 2008 and the accusations she faces now are clear , particularly in an age when money appears to buy access in politics .\n\u201c I would say they are comparable , \u201d said Brendan Fischer , associate counsel at the Campaign Legal Center , a campaign finance watchdog group . \u201c I think it speaks to the larger culture of politics in Washington , D.C. , where those with the deepest pockets are afforded the greatest access . \u201d\nMr. Fischer said deep-pocketed donors most commonly contribute to officials or candidates either through their campaigns or through associated super PACs .\n\u201c But in this instance , we have the Clinton Foundation , and I think this does show that money not only buys access in the context of a campaign , but also through contributions to groups that are not related to elections but otherwise associated with the candidate , like the Clinton Foundation , \u201d he said .\nThe Associated Press reported this week that out of a set of 154 private individuals who were allowed meetings or phone calls with Mrs. Clinton during her time as secretary of state , 85 of them gave to the Clinton Foundation or pledged commitments to its international programs .\nThe report follows newly released emails that show foundation executives used Huma Abedin , Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s closest personal aide , as a conduit to try to earn favorable treatment or access for its donors .\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump says it \u2019 s evidence of a \u201c pay for play \u201d atmosphere at Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s State Department .\nHe and other Republicans are calling on a special prosecutor to investigate , and the candidate drew a connection Wednesday between the latest revelations about the foundation and the controversy over Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s private email server .\n\u201c It \u2019 s impossible to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s aides feverishly fought the criticism , saying it amounted to a \u201c reprehensible attack on a charity. \u201d They said Mrs. Clinton is the victim of a double standard .\nCampaign spokesman Brian Fallon said similar questions weren \u2019 t raised or attacks launched against former President George H.W . Bush \u2019 s Points of Light Foundation or against 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole , whose wife , Elizabeth Dole , ran the American Red Cross .\n\u201c And rightfully so , because [ these ] are charitable organizations that are doing important work , and the idea that they would be dragged into a political back-and-forth and used as weapons for attacks is completely absurd and beyond the pale , \u201d Mr. Fallon said on MSNBC .\n\u201c You know what ? If any American voter is troubled by the idea that the Clintons want to continue to solve the AIDS crisis on the side while Hillary Clinton is president , then don \u2019 t vote for her , \u201d Mr. Fallon said . \u201c But I think most voters are pretty reasonable on that point . \u201d\nFormer President Bill Clinton defended the foundation on similar grounds , telling reporters in Atlanta on Wednesday , \u201c If there \u2019 s something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives , I don \u2019 t know what it is . \u201d\nMr. Fallon also said the story was a \u201c cherry-pick \u201d of a comparatively small subset of some 1,700 meetings Mrs. Clinton held and that there was nothing untoward about talking with people like Melinda Gates , the wife of Microsoft founder Bill Gates .\nBut Republicans said the matter was serious enough that Mrs. Clinton needs to break her streak and hold a press conference for the first time this year .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s own operation has implicitly acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest , saying the foundation will change its policy and reject corporate and foreign donations if she wins the White House .\nThe last time Mrs. Clinton ran for president , her campaign was demanding more transparency in Mr. Obama \u2019 s relationship with Mr. Rezko , an Obama fundraiser who was convicted in June 2008 of charges tied to a kickback scheme involving the disgraced Blagojevich .\n\u201c We still don \u2019 t have a lot of answers about Sen.
