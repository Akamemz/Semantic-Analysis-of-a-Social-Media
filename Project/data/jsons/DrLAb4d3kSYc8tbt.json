They warned ships across Mideast waterways crucial to global energy supplies about the \u201c possibility of Iranian action \u201d against U.S. maritime interests in the region .\nPresident Donald Trump ordered the Jan. 2 strike against Gen. Qassem Soleimani , the head of Iran \u2019 s elite Quds Force , after the death of an American contractor in Iraq . Now , amid massive demonstrations of Iran \u2019 s public mourning period for Soleimani and a state TV report of a deadly stampede at his funeral , officials believe the next steps by America \u2019 s longtime foe will determine the ultimate course of the latest crisis .\nWhile officials say American intelligence isn \u2019 t clear on whether Iran \u2019 s latest military moves are designed to bolster Tehran \u2019 s defenses or prepare for an offensive strike , the U.S. is continuing to reinforce its own positions in the region , including repositioning some forces . One official said the U.S. anticipated a \u201c major \u201d attack of some type within the next day or two .\nOn Monday , Defense Secretary Mark Esper said no decision had been made about withdrawing troops from Iraq . Pro-Iranian factions in the Iraqi Parliament have pushed to oust American troops following Soleimani \u2019 s killing on Iraqi soil . Esper spoke to reporters after a letter from a U.S. Marine general circulated that seemed to suggest a withdrawal had been ordered in response to a vote by the Iraqi Parliament over the weekend . \u201c There \u2019 s been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq , \u201d Esper said .\nOn Tuesday , the U.S. Maritime Administration put out the warning for ships , citing the rising threats after Soleimani \u2019 s killing . Oil tankers were targeted last year in mine attacks the U.S. blamed on Iran . Tehran denied being responsible though it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz , the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20 % of the world \u2019 s crude oil travels .\nSoleimani \u2019 s death , which has sparked major protests , further nuclear development and new threats of violence , has raised the prospect of a wide and unpredictable conflict in the Middle East and escalated tensions between Iran and the U.S .\nMeanwhile , the U.S. said it would not issue a visa to Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to attend a U.N. meeting this week . The U.S. , which has severely restricted the movements of Iranian diplomats in New York in the past , contends there was not enough time to process the visa request .\nThe two nations have careened from one flare-up to another since Trump began his \u201c maximum pressure \u201d campaign against Iran shortly after taking office . He abrogated the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed crushing economic sanctions , both steps aimed at preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and deterring the sort of regional aggression spearheaded by Soleimani .\nTwo U.S. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions , said targeting Soleimani was not representative of a wholesale shift in American policy toward Iran , despite Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2019 s comments on Sunday that the U.S. was targeting Iran \u2019 s \u201c actual decision-makers \u201d rather than its network of proxy allies . Trump has repeatedly contended that he is not seeking \u201c regime change \u201d in Iran , as has been pushed by some of his more hawkish advisers .\nPompeo sought Tuesday to place the killing of Soleimani within the Trump administration \u2019 s campaign on Iran , noting there was a military component to the strategy as well as diplomatic and economic aspects .\n\u201c Our Iran policy is about protecting and defending the homeland and protecting and securing American lives , \u201d he said in a State Department news conference . \u201c I know that the efforts that we have taken , not only last week with the strike against Soleimani but the strategy we have employed , has saved American lives . \u201d\nStill , Trump \u2019 s strike against Soleimani , a revered figure in Iran whose death sparked large displays of anger and grief , was a risky decision his Republican and Democratic predecessors opted not to take out of concern it would draw the U.S. and Iran closer to conflict .\nU.S. officials are also aware that Iran could try to strike a high-level American leader in a \u201c tit-for-tat \u201d move , potentially a military commander .\nOne official said some Iranian ships have spread out , and while the intent isn \u2019 t immediately clear , they could move rapidly to attack .\nThe U.S. military has increased protection of its forces , particularly in Iraq . Officials said a number of the recently deployed soldiers from the 1st Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division had moved into Iraq from Kuwait in order to increase security for Americans there . The U.S. military has stopped all training of Iraqi forces to focus on force protection , officials said .\nAs of Monday , officials said , there had not been a broadly distributed order or recommendation to increase security at military installations worldwide .
