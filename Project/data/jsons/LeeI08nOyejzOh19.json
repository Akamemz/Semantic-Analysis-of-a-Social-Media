His family had reported him missing for two to three days during a trip home , said dispatcher Brad Rhodes from Henderson Trucking Company .\nThe driver was supposed to return to work Wednesday , but did not show up . Rhodes did not confirm if the driver of that vehicle was the missing man and did not know the missing driver 's fate .\nOn Thursday , a Baltimore police investigation into Gray 's death found no evidence he died as the result of injuries caused during his arrest , according to CNN affiliate WJLA , citing `` multiple law enforcement sources briefed on the police findings . ''\nThe sources quoted by the Washington-based station said the medical examiner had determined Gray 's death was caused by a catastrophic injury after he slammed into the back of the police transport van while inside it , `` apparently breaking his neck ; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van . ''\nThe station said it was unclear what caused Gray to slam into the back of the van and whether Gray caused the injury .\nAn official in the state 's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner would n't comment to CNN on the report , citing an ongoing investigation . The official said the autopsy report on Gray could be delivered to the State 's Attorney Office `` as soon as tomorrow or early next week .
