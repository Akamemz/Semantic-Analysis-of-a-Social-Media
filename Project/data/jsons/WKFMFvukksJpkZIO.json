    "content": "Not all the claims in the vice presidential debate stand up to scrutiny . A look at some of them and how they compare with the facts :\nREPUBLICAN MIKE PENCE : `` The fact that under this past administration , we 've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious .... Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same . ''\nTHE FACTS : As a share of the total U.S. economy , the national debt has gone up 35 percent ; not a doubling .\nStill , the debt has ballooned to $ 19.6 trillion . This largely reflected efforts by the Obama administration to stop the Great Recession .\nWould Clinton similarly increase the debt ? Not according to an analysis by the independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget .\nThe Clinton plan with its tax increases would increase the gross debt -- both privately and publicly held -- by $ 450 billion over 10 years . Mind you , that is on top of an $ 8.8 trillion increase already projected by the government under current law .\nAs for Donald Trump , the committee says his tax-cut-heavy plan would increase the gross debt by $ 4.3 trillion -- nearly 10 times more than Clinton 's plan would do .\nDEMOCRAT TIM KAINE , on fighting the Islamic State : `` Donald Trump does n't have a plan . ''\nTHE FACTS : Clinton also does n't have a plan that is materially different than what President Barack Obama is already doing .\nShe 's described a three-part strategy that involves crushing IS `` on its home turf '' in the Middle East , disrupting its infrastructure on the ground and online , and protecting America and its allies . All are current elements of the Obama administration 's strategy , so it 's not clear what would change or if she would accelerate any portions of it .\nIt 's also the case that Trump has not laid out a clear plan .\nPENCE , calling Clinton the `` architect of the Obama administration 's foreign policy , '' says the crisis in Syria was the result of a `` failed and weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead . ''\nTHE FACTS : Clinton , as secretary of state , actually pushed for increased U.S. intervention after Syrian President Bashar Assad used chemical weapons against rebels . But Obama is the commander in chief and nothing has swayed him thus far . Whatever her failings might be on foreign policy , it 's a stretch to accuse her of helping to lead a weak policy on Syria .\nPENCE : `` We 've seen an economy stifled by more taxes , more regulation , a war on coal . ''\nTHE FACTS : The coal industry 's woes do n't come solely from onerous federal regulations . Pence omitted the effects of steep competition from cheap natural gas .\nA string of major coal companies have filed for bankruptcy in recent years , including Arch Coal , Alpha Natural Resources and Peabody Energy . Layoffs and cutbacks have spread economic suffering through coal country in the Appalachians and Wyoming 's Powder River Basin . By contrast , these are boom times for natural gas extraction , mostly due to hydraulic fracturing , or fracking .\nStill , the Obama administration has implemented rules that are n't making the coal industry 's life any easier . Obama last year imposed a rule requiring coal-fired power plants to cut their carbon emissions as part of his effort to combat climate change . The rule has been suspended pending a legal challenge . Obama also has halted new coal leases on federal lands until it completes a comprehensive review .\nPENCE , saying he 's proud that `` the state of Indiana has balanced budgets . ''\nTHE FACTS : True , but that 's not exactly to his credit as governor of Indiana . A balanced budget is required by law , as it is in every state except Vermont .",
