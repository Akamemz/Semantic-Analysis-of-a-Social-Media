    "content": "An FBI investigation into the activities of Dzohkar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev , the two young Chechen men who perpetrated the April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260 , were partially influenced by Anwar al-Awlaki , a radical American-born Muslim cleric who later moved to Yemen .\nThe New York Times reported that Dzokhar , 19 , the surviving Tsarnaev brother , told law enforcement officials that they were inspired by Internet sermons delivered by Awlaki , who was killed by U.S. drones September 2011 . However , it is unclear if the Tsarnaevs had any direct contact with Awlaki during their path toward radicalism .\n( Tamerlan was shot to death by police in an intense gunfight soon after the Boston bombings . )\nDkzohar also told FBI investigators that he and his brother wanted to strike American targets in retaliation for the U.S. military \u2019 s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . But he also insisted that he and his brother were not part of a wider terror network and operated alone .\nAside from Awlaki \u2019 s fiery sermons , Dzokhar told FBI officials that he and his brother learned how to construct pressure-cooker bombs from an online magazine called Inspire , published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . The man believed to be behind Inspire , a U.S. citizen named Samir Khan , was killed in the same drone stroke that ended the life of Awlaki in the fall of 2011 .\nAwlaki , who was born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents , eventually rose to become a senior operative in the Yemeni branch of al Qaeda . His death sparked some controversy for the Barack Obama administration given that U.S. military drones were being used to kill American citizens ( apparently for the first time in history ) .\nAwlaki first came to the FBI \u2019 s attention as long ago as 1999 due to his association with known Muslim militants . In the wake of the 9/11 attacks , he was questioned by the FBI over his association with some of the hijackers who plowed an aircraft into the World Trade Center , killing thousands .\nAwlaki allegedly came into contact with the 9/11 hijackers while serving as an imam at a mosque in Falls Church , Va .\nAwlaki departed the U.S. for good in 2002 ending up in Yemen in 2004 , where he was jailed for 18 months in connection with an alleged al Qaeda plot to kidnap a U.S. military attach\u00e9 , as well as a Shiite teenager . Awlaki \u2019 s detention was reportedly encouraged by U.S. authorities who put pressure on their Yemeni allies at the time .\nAwlaki was released from prison , apparently due to intervention by members of his tribe , but it is not clear if the U.S. approved his freedom or not .\nThereafter , the firebrand preacher showed up on the Internet , exhorting young Muslims around the world , including in the West , to fight the U.S. , which he claimed was at \u201c war with Islam .
