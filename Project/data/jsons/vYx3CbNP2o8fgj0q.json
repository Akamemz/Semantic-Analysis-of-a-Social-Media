    "content": "Tonight 's third and final 2012 presidential debate will feature 90 minutes on foreign policy -- an extremely important set of issues , of course , but not a subject area that sits atop voters ' list of concerns this year . As President Obama and Governor Romney enter tonight 's third-round bout , a cross-section of polls are converging to cement a clear pre-debate trend : The Republican challenger has established a modest lead over the incumbent nationally , while building momentum in critical battleground states . Let 's take a peek at some of the data :\n( 1 ) Rasmussen and Gallup - The two primary daily tracking polls both show Romney in the lead among likely voters . Rasmussen pegs Romney 's edge at two points ( 49/47 ) , while Gallup again shows a larger cushion ( 51/45 ) . The GOP candidate has held a lead of greater than five points in this poll for more than a week . For the third straight day , Rasmussen 's ( slightly more volatile ) swing state tracker shows Romney out front by a handful of points . Today , it 's 49/46 .\n( 2 ) NBC/WSJ - This national survey has consistently been among least kind to Republicans in recent months , yet it ca n't avoid picking up on the emerging trend . Dan covered this poll yesterday ; it shows a 47/47 tie . As NBC 's Chuck Todd says , sitting at 47 percent two weeks out is n't a position of strength for an incumbent president :\n( 3 ) Politico/GWU - Romney has vaulted out to a ( slight ) lead in this poll for the first time , at 49/47 . The partisan sample is D+4 , which is generally reasonable , but might overstate Democrats ' turnout edge by a hair . In the poll 's swing state sub-sample , Romney leads by the exact same margin , but hits the 50 percent mark . Ed Morrissey says the survey 's internals paint a slightly rosier picture for the GOP ticket :\nTwo keys suggest Romney \u2019 s doing better than his toplines . First , he \u2019 s winning the gender gap . Romney gets a +10 among men , while Obama gets a +8 among women , for a +2 advantage for Romney . In 2008 , Obama had a +14 gender gap advantage over John McCain . Obama wins single women , but is getting clobbered among married women , 42/55 . Romney \u2019 s also leading among women without children overall , 50/46 , suggesting that women who already know how to access birth control aren \u2019 t terribly concerned about it as an election issue . The second key is age demographics . Obama has a 30-point lead among voters 34 years and younger , but that \u2019 s his only win . He and Romney tie among 35-44YOs at 48 each , but Romney has double digit leads among 45-64YOs ( 54/44 ) and seniors ( 58/38 ) . Those last two demographics are the most likely to vote in the election .\nYounger voters tend to be the most pro-Obama cohort -- but they 're also the most disillusioned group , and are less likely to vote than any other demographic . Team Romney would happily accept a double-digit loss among millenials if they can lock up large margins among older voters .\n( 4 ) Monmouth University - Romney 48 , Obama 45 . The three point Romney edge in the top line is nice , but again , the sitting president at 45 percent is the bigger result . How does the Republican build his advantage ? Carrying independents handily on every major question . Here are a few examples , indies only :\nHead-to-head : Romney 52 , Obama 33 Favorability : Romney +22 , Obama -15 Economy and jobs : Romney 57 , Obama 34 Medicare and Social Security : Romney 53 , Obama 33 Budget and deficits : Romney 57 , Obama 29 Foreign Policy : Romney 49 , Obama 39\nMonmouth 's overall sample was D+4 , which explains the relatively close top line outcome . Let 's close with a quick look at fresh state polls :\nColorado - Romney 50 , Obama 46 Iowa - Romney 47 , Obama 47 Ohio - Romney 48 , Obama 48\nThe first two surveys are from Rasmussen ; the Ohio data is from the firm Angus Reid , whose Buckeye State results closely mirror two additional polls that came out yesterday . National Review 's `` numbers muncher , Josh Jordan , explains why the Ohio data may be stronger for Romney than meets the eye . ( Hint -- Partisan samples and independents ) :\nThe poll from Gravis Marketing shows Obama and Romney tied at 47 percent . But that \u2019 s as good as it gets for Obama . Among the most interesting tidbits from the poll : Romney leads Obama by 19 percent among independents , 52\u201333 , and holds 92 percent of his base compared to Obama \u2019 s 87 percent . Obama is underwater in job approval , 44\u201350 , and independents disapprove of him overwhelmingly , 31\u201358 .\nThe Gravis poll is a D+9 and PPP 's is D+8 . This assumes that the 2012 electorate will be more Democratic than 2008 , an assumption that seems inoperative , given the early voting tightening . Quinnipiac also released an Ohio poll today , showing Obama ahead by 5 points . Despite its ludicrous D+9 breakdown , the survey shows Romney gaining . Do n't forget , it was the Q-poll that all but declared the race over in Florida , Ohio and Virginia late last month . Oops . In short , with nearly two weeks left until election day , Republicans have ample reason to be optimistic . Maybe not quite this optimistic , though . The race is nip-and-tuck , and one never knows when the trajectory might shift again . Tonight is the last head-to-head event leading up to November 6 , and therefore may present the president with his best shot at re-shuffling the deck .\nUPDATE - More red flags for Team O from that NBC/WSJ poll . A large majority of voters say that if Obama is re-elected , they want to see him dramatically alter his policies :\nHe 's basically been running a `` stay the course '' campaign ( `` we 've come too far , '' etc ) , so voters have plenty of reason to doubt the president 's ability to , well , change .\nUPDATE II - Hey look , another Ohio poll showing the race exactly tied .",
