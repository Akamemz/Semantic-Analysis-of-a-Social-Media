    "content": "Donald Trump 's so-far incoherent softening this week of his hardline immigration policy is a good time to remind people of a fact that , in a just world , would be cause for painful introspection among Republican politicians and conservative commentators for years to come : This outsider real estate/TV mogul , less than three years after blaming Mitt Romney 's loss on the 2012 candidate 's `` mean-spirited , '' `` crazy , '' and `` maniacal '' policy of encouraging self-deportation , managed not only to win the GOP nomination on an explicitly anti-constitutional hostility to immigrants , but to pull almost his entire competitive set into an authoritarian fantasy land where borders can be `` sealed , '' human beings can be treated like FedEx packages , the 14th Amendment can be wished away , and\u2014what the hell ! \u2014a wall might be a good idea up north as well .\nThe GOP 's nativist summer was revealing not just in the way that it accelerated the party 's long trend away from the Reagan/Bush welcome mat toward a more Tancredoan restrictionism , but also in how it ratified the obviously unattainable demands of conservatism 's entertainment wing as the party 's preferred policy approach . Those commentators who damn well knew that you could never deport 15,000 illegal immigrants a day ( plus another 5,000 or so of their U.S.-citizen children ) , yet cheered Trump on when he said crazy stuff like that , deliberately chose know-nothingism over reality . Never forget that the same National Review that showily came out `` Against Trump '' in January , were spending last August editorializing that `` Trump 's Immigration Plan Is a Good Start\u2014for All GOP Candidates , '' while its editor encouraged the party to `` pander to Trump on immigration . ''\nAll of which are reasons why Gary Johnson 's column at CNN Opinion today is such a refreshing jolt of reality into a debate in which participants on both sides of the political aisle prefer to perpetuate fantasy . The Libertarian nominee for president gets straight to the point :\nRounding up more than 11 million people\u2014a population larger than all but the 7 largest states in the union\u2014is a ludicrous notion to begin with . Everyone knows it , including Donald Trump . It was a lie cloaked in a promise . Even if it were possible , the idea of federal authorities rounding up millions of people and loading them on buses is an image America could never stomach .\nEmphasis mine . I agree with Nick Gillespie that it is good news Trump has flipped on this issue , but there is an underlying sickness with a political tendency that privileges such lies .\nThe fear-mongers would have you believe 11 million people swam the Rio Grande , burrowed under a fence or otherwise sneaked into our communities in the dead of night . Yes , some of them did . But a significant number of undocumented immigrants actually came here legally\u2014and stayed . Many did n't come\u2014and nor do they remain\u2014for nefarious reasons , but because they found work , established relationships or joined family members . They could n't stay legally due to special-interest-driven restrictions on their visas . They were students who graduated or found jobs , seasonal workers who found year-round work , or children brought here by their parents . Of those who did hike the mountains of Arizona or stow away in a container ship , how many of them would have rather come here legally if the line to enter was actually moving ? Almost all of them .\nThe key to illegal immigration , as we keep telling you here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 ( and Ronald Reagan and George H.W . Bush did 36 years ago ) , is to stop looking at it like a criminality problem , and start recognizing it as an artifact of prohibition and bureaucratization . As Johnson writes , `` If it took months or years to get a driver 's license , how many of us would throw up our hands , get behind the wheel , and take our chances driving without one ? You know who you are . '' The reality of `` Get in Line ! '' is the unspoken tagline : `` And stay out . '' The Libertarian approach ? `` The way to stop illegal entry is to spend our resources making legal entry efficient for people coming here for the right reasons . ''\nImmigration is not a simple policy issue ( one of many reasons why it 's still with us politically ) , and Johnson still has some convincing to do about the details of his approach , not least in terms of how precisely federal authorities will know enough about an immigrant 's background , and what the new legal category will be created for former illegals who get right with the law . But here 's his opening bid : `` No caps . No categories . No quotas . Just a straightforward background check , the proper paperwork to obtain a real Social Security number and work legally or prove legitimate family ties , and a reliable system to know who is coming and who is going . Border enforcement will become what it should be : Keeping out real criminals , would-be terrorists and others sneaking across the border for the wrong reasons . ''\nAs entrenched as they may seem today , the two major political parties have each shifted a great deal over the years on immigration . Two decades ago , Bill Clinton 's Democratic Party was positively Trumpesque in its security-first , crime-scaremongering approach , and it 's only been since 2008 that Democrats have focused so singularly on a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally . But both parties have long since abandoned the notion that you have to primarily change the legal immigration regime if you want a policy that approaches sanity . I ca n't tell you if Gary Johnson 's precise set of policy recommendations is the best approach , but it sure is refreshing to read a politician at least take a legitimate stab of describing the world as it really exists .",
