    "content": "Since being signed into law by President Obama in 2010 , the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare , has been stripped , changed and full of devastating consequences for the American economy and American families . It 's clear by now that the White House and Democrats who voted for Obamacare , lied to millions of Americans when they said , `` If you like your healthcare plan , you can keep it . Period . '' We not only saw President Obama admit during a healthcare summit in early 2010 ( before signing Obamacare ) `` that between eight million and nine million people may very well lose the coverage that they have , because of this ... And I don \u2019 t think that you can answer the question , in the positive , to say that people will be able to maintain their coverage , people will be able to see the doctors they want in the kind of bill that you \u2019 re proposing . ''\nThen in September of 2010 , every single Senate Democrat voted against a resolution that would allow people to keep their healthcare plans .\nIn September 2010 , Senate Republicans brought a resolution to the floor to block implementation of the grandfather rule , warning that it would result in canceled policies and violate President Barack Obama \u2019 s promise that people could keep their insurance if they liked it .\nThree years later in November 2013 , we saw Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admit under oath in front of Congress that end-to-end security testing was not done on Healthcare.gov before it was launched on October 1 , putting the personal information of Americans at risk and making them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft .\nAs a result of all of this and the trashing of the U.S. constitution in the process , Associate Professor of Economics at St. John \u2019 s University , New York .
