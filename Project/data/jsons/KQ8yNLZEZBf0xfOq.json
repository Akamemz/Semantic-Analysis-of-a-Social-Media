    "content": "Congress has been debating , among other things , the Obama-era Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program and what to do with its 800,000 recipients who benefit from this constitutionally questionable executive action . The executive order issued by Obama shielded illegal aliens from deportation as long as they meet the criteria ( i.e . no criminal record ) and paid the $ 495 in application fees . DACA status had to be rented every two years . If accepted , DACA recipients had access to work permits . The program applied to illegal aliens that entered the U.S. as minors .
