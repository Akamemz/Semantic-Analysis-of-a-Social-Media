At least one letter requesting information about one of the groups bears the signature of Lois Lerner , the suspended director of the IRS Exempt Organizations department in Washington .\nJay Sekulow , an attorney representing 27 conservative political advocacy organizations that applied to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status , provided some of the letters to NBC News . He said the groups \u2019 contacts with the IRS prove that the practices went beyond a few \u201c front line \u201d employees in the Cincinnati office , as the IRS has maintained .\n\u201c We 've dealt with 15 agents , including tax law specialists -- that 's lawyers -- from four different offices , including ( the ) Treasury ( Department ) in Washington , D.C. , \u201d Sekulow said . \u201c So the idea that this is a couple of rogue agents in Cincinnati is not correct . \u201d\nAmong the letters were several that bore return IRS addresses other than Cincinnati , including `` Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington , D.C. , '' and the signatures of IRS officials higher up the chain . Two letters with `` Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service / Washington , D.C. '' letterhead were signed by `` Tax Law Specialist ( s ) '' from Exempt Organizations Technical Group 1 and Technical Group 2 . Lerner \u2019 s signature , which appeared to be a stamp rather than an actual signature , appeared on a letter requesting additional information from the Ohio Liberty Council Corp .\nLerner has become one of the public faces of the controversy after refusing to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last Wednesday , citing her Constitutional Fifth Amendment rights after reading a brief statement : \u201c I have not done anything wrong . I have not broken any laws , violated IRS regulations or provided false information to this or any other committee . \u201d\nShe was put on administrative leave at the end of last week after reportedly refusing to resign at Obama administration \u2019 s request . She is continuing to collect federal paychecks on her almost $ 180,000 annual salary , though at least one Republican senator , Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa , a member of the Senate Finance Committee , is urging the agency to speed up the process and fire her .\nIn the two weeks since the IRS acknowledged it targeted conservative organizations seeking status as tax-exempt `` social welfare '' organizations for additional scrutiny , many Republicans have sought to link the agency \u2019 s actions to the White House . In an Op-Ed piece in the Washington Post on May 22 , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , wrote that \u201c the administration has been extremely creative in employing throughout the federal government the sorts of intimidation tactics that were used at the IRS . \u201d\nThe White House has dismissed suggestions it was aware of the targeting , saying President Barack Obama only learned of the issue when it broke in the news on May 10 . White House spokesman Jay Carney has since deflected most questions about the scandal , saying it would be inappropriate to comment until an FBI inquiry into the agency \u2019 s actions \u2013 one of five separate government investigations -- is concluded .\nFor its part , the IRS has declined additional comment beyond its congressional testimony -- including former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller 's testimony that IRS employees didn \u2019 t have partisan motives and only made `` foolish mistakes ... trying to be more efficient \u201d -- and other previously released public statements , including its response to a Treasury inspector general ( see pages 49-51 ) and a Q & A on 501 ( c ) groups it published on its website .\nBut attorneys for some of the targeted groups \u2019 provided documentation and two IRS employees in the Cincinnati office made statements to NBC News that call into question parts of the official explanation Americans have heard from the IRS so far .\nSekulow , who worked with the office of the chief counsel of the IRS in the early 1980s as a trial lawyer representing the IRS on tax-exempt cases , said the number of groups he \u2019 s heard from , and the scope of the requests for information the IRS sent them , persuaded him \u201c that this was not something that was just created at an agent level , that this was certainly higher up . \u201d\nAfter reviewing all the IRS communications his clients received , Sekulow said he believes the IRS was engaged in a coordinated and deliberate attempt to silence , or at least stifle conservative organizations , he told NBC News .\nSekulow also said the practices continued well after May 2012 , when the IRS has claimed they had stopped . Sekulow said 10 of the organizations he represents still have not received determinations from the IRS on their applications for tax-exempt status as 501 C ( 1 ) ( 4 ) organizations .
