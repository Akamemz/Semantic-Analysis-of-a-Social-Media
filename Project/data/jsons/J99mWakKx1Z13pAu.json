    "content": "On the afternoon of March 23 , Jagath Ekanayake was finishing a cup of tea when his supervisor , James Barringer , told him to clear out . Ekanayake , a scientist , engineer and inventor at Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research Institute in New Zealand , is in charge of collecting data on soil moisture and temperature with wireless sensors . He was about to embark on a two-year ecological study to measure the health of soil on several farms stretching across country when the government moved to alert level four and his experiment was put on hold indefinitely . Ekanayake spent the remainder of the afternoon going back and forth from his lab to the parking garage\u2014carrying his multimeter , his soldering station , his oscilloscope and numerous bags of cables , wires and circuit boards . He filled his trunk and slowly drove away .\nBy the first week of April , roughly four billion people\u2014half the global population\u2014were in lockdown . The lockdown had the impact of a blunt force injury , leaving researchers all over the world reeling and disoriented . At the University of Antioquia in Colombia , herpetologists working with critically endangered reptiles carried the temperature- sensitive unhatched eggs to their homes . NASA engineers quickly learned to pilot the Mars Curiosity rover remotely .\nAnyone would be forgiven for feeling lethargic and overwhelmed during a global pandemic . But some among us were wildly productive . They found ingenious workarounds\u2014inventing , cataloging and even making significant scientific breakthroughs , from the comfort of home . In England , a team of archeologists at the University of Exeter analyzing images generated by LiDAR sensors , and partnering with volunteers working from home , impressively discovered more than 20 Roman settlements buried across Devon and Cornwall\u2014all on their laptops .\nEkanayake \u2019 s garage was too cold to work in , so the engineer spent his confinement constructing a wireless sensor network on his living room table . Agricultural production ravages ecosystems ; his network pinpoints terrain that can deliver high yield crops with minimal fertilizer , preserving New Zealand \u2019 s unique biodiversity . Ekanayake ran out of space on the table , so he dragged all the family \u2019 s furniture out and used the floor . Eventually , his wife , Chitra , let him use the kitchen counters too . Over the course of the lockdown , Ekanayake would happily work 12-hour days , boring dozens of holes in his front yard with a handheld auger , then burying and testing each sensor he \u2019 d constructed .\nRoughly 11,000 miles away , Amruta Gadge , a quantum physicist at the University of Sussex in England , was bitterly disappointed to learn that her lab was closing indefinitely . She told her husband , a theoretical physicist , that the lockdown would derail her career . Several weeks later , working from home , she became the first scientist in history to create a Bose-Einstein Condensate ( BEC ) \u2014the exotic , elusive fifth state of matter\u2014remotely .\nThe condensate is a cloud of rubidium atoms that has been cooled to nanokelvin temperatures . The procedure involves several rounds of radio and laser cooling . During the process , the clump of atoms is held into place in a \u201c trap \u201d of electromagnetic fields , displayed inside its ultra-high vacuum chamber like a tiny Baked Alaska . When the minimum possible energy level is reached , the particles slow to a near stop and merge , behaving as a single wave with weird quantum properties . Still stuck in her living room two miles from her lab , Gadge controls the conditions of the BEC from her computer .\nGadge \u2019 s leap into quantum physics was ( appropriately ) random . She had entered a university program planning to study another field , but had been accidently placed in the wrong module . Nonetheless , the moment she entered the lab she was hooked . \u201c I liked doing things by hand\u2014it was all very cool , \u201d she says . \u201c I got to play . \u201d\nHer lockdown triumph hints at a near-future of remote lab work in far-flung , inhospitable environments , such as outer space or the deep sea . But at the moment , Gadge is focused on her next objective - using the condensate as an ultra-efficient sensor to measure the magnetic fields holding it in place , with an eye towards advancing new technologies in neuroimaging .\nBrian Brown \u2019 s heart leapt when the California lockdown was announced . \u201c It seemed like a dream come true , \u201d says the chief entomology curator at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles . He loves his job , which he has held for 28 years , but it involves meetings . The lockdown was an opportunity to focus on lab work with no distractions . He was able to prepare long in advance , bringing home his microscopes and plenty of specimens , particularly of Phorid flies . Brown \u2019 s passion for flies has driven him halfway around the world . He \u2019 s written countless papers on them . He \u2019 s examined specimens preserved in 100-million-year-old pieces of amber . In his spare time , he runs a blog called flyobsession.net where he touts their admirable qualities , like their diversity . \u201c They can be parasites , predators , scavengers , fungus feeders , \u201d he says . \u201c They \u2019 re the ones who pollinate cacao plants , which is the source of chocolate ! \u201d\nIf flies are his guilty pleasure , the lockdown gave him an excuse to indulge . . . perhaps too much . Brown \u2019 s initial enthusiasm for the confinement has started to flag ; over time , he \u2019 s been surprised to find that he misses interacting with people . But working remotely with assistant entomology collection manager Lisa Gonzalez , Brown has discovered nine new species of phorid flies in just under two months , bringing his personal total to 600 new insect species discovered . There \u2019 s a downside to being so prolific . \u201c You start running out of things to use for names \u201d he says .\nWhen she was seven years old , Ste\u0301phanie Lizy-Destrez received an illustrated book about Marie Curie from her grandfather . She was a shy child in Villars-sur-Var , a village of less than 100 people in the French Alps . She had few friends . She spent long stretches of time looking up at the sky . Far from the city lights , shooting stars were visible at night . After closing the book , she dreamt of her future . \u201c Marie Curie was the only girl among a lot of guys and she succeeded ; she ran experiments , she did testing , \u201d Lizy-Destrez says . \u201c [ I thought ] , yeah I can do that too . \u201d\nYears later , in March 2020 , Lizy-Destrez was in the midst of coordinating a Mars mission simulation with an international team\u2014representatives from NASA , Mars Desert Research Station ( MDRS ) and Roscosmos ( Russia \u2019 s space agency ) . As a space researcher at ISAE-SUPAERO , an aeronautics university in Toulouse , Lizy-Destrez \u2019 s study was scheduled to start within days . She was investigating the psychological impact of confinement and isolation on crew members during long duration missions . The participants\u2014three men and three women\u2014had been selected and were about to be sealed into a Moscow facility for eight months . Everyone was ready . Then French President Emmanuel Macron announced the confinement . Lizy-Destrez pivoted quickly . Two days into lockdown she began a modified version of the Mars study using 60 of her students .\nHer pupils performed tasks , completed psychological testing and kept daily journals on their computers . Strictly confined to their small dormitory rooms , they made ideal test subjects . When French news media reported on her work , she was contacted by members of the public wanting to volunteer . After a careful selection process , she expanded the study . The average space mission simulation has four to six participants . Lizy-Destrez signed up over a hundred subjects , ranging in ages from 13 to 50 years old\u2014making hers the largest space mission study in history . Still barred from her lab , she \u2019 s now analyzing her findings .\nAt the Church of San Lorenzo in Venice , Ann-Sofi Ro\u0308nnskog and John Palmesino were putting the finishing touches on \u201c Oceans in Transformation \u201d \u2014the result of three years of hard work . The 30-screen video installation consists of raw oceanographic data\u2014current and historical\u2014that the pair has collected and converted into images . The images are then layered , one on top of the other , to striking effect .

In late February , only weeks before their exhibition was to open , the Finland-based citizen scientists were forced to flee Italy .\nAs human activity decreased , shoals of tiny fish began to return to the deserted canals surrounding the church . Similarly , changes appeared in the marine data the pair continued to accumulate . As the lockdown unfolded , they noted the rapid shift , worldwide , in carbon and nitrogen oxide levels .
