The Affordable Care Act creates exchanges in which consumers can purchase health insurance that will be managed and operated by private health insurers . The Washington Post 's Fact Checker blog pointed out that the ACA \u201c builds on the existing private insurance \u201d much like Massachusetts health insurance reform of 2006 . Politfact called the claim that the ACA is a \u201c government takeover of health care \u201d the 2010 \u201c Lie of the Year , \u201d explaining that the law \u201c relies largely on the free market \u201d :\nEmployers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies .

The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors . The law does not include the public option , a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers . The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance , so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange .
