As Syrian President Bashar Assad clings to power amid a civil war , Jordan has already absorbed more than 460,000 refugees across its borders and King Abdullah is worried that number could double by the end of the year .\n\u201c Obviously , this has added economic and financial costs due to the influx and has further strained the economy that is already under considerable pressures with an unstable region , a sluggish economy that is still recovering , \u201d the king said .\nExpressing gratitude for the U.S. assistance , the king said he would continue to keep the borders open to Syrian refugees and appealed to the entire international community for more help to face this \u201c humanitarian calamity . \u201d\n\u201c I mean , how are you going to turn back women , children and the wounded ? \u201d he asked . \u201c This is something that we just can \u2019 t do . It \u2019 s not the Jordanian way . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Obama helps broker Israel-Turkey exchange over flotilla deaths\nPressed on why the U.S. has not taken a more interventionist approach to the Syria \u2019 s civil war , even as the government and rebels traded accusations of chemical weapons use , Mr. Obama stuck by his stand that the U.S. should not unilaterally impose its will on foreign governments .\nWhile Mr. Obama called the bloodshed \u201c heartbreaking , \u201d he highlighted the State Department \u2019 s work to help form a coherent Syrian Opposition Council , and provide training resources and humanitarian assistance . He said it is better to work along with \u201c interested parties in the region \u201d and allow the people of a country to determine their own future .\nOn Thursday , Mr. Obama said he is extremely skeptical of reports that the Syrian people launched a chemical weapons attack on opposition rebels , but he said the United Nations is investigating the charges to find out exactly what happened . He also reiterated his threat that chemical use by the Assad regime would force the U.S. government to act , calling the such an attack \u201c a game-changer from our perspective . \u201d\nHe repeated his call for Mr. Assad to step down but said the international community should be focusing its efforts on what happens after he leaves , calling his departure only a matter of time .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t do it alone , and the outcome in Syria is not going to be ideal \u2014 even if we execute our assistance and our coordination and our planning and support flawlessly . The situation in Syria now is going to be difficult , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s what happens when you have a leader who cares more about clinging to power than they do about holding their country together and looking after their people . \u201d\nAsked if Jordan \u2019 s previous offer of asylum for Mr. Assad still on the table , King Abdullah said that is a question the Syrian leader has to answer himself . Leaders in the international community are still consulting on whether that is the best move to end the violence as quickly as possible .\n\u201c So if the issue of asylum ever came up , that \u2019 s something that I think all of us would have to put our heads together to figure out whether or not , if that sort of ends the violence quickly , it \u2019 s something worth pursuing , \u201d he said .",
