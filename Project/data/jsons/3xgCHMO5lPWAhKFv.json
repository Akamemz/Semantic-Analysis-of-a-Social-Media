    "content": "Most Iowa insiders believe Scott Walker would win their state \u2019 s Republican caucuses if they were held this week .\nBut they \u2019 re not this week , and virtually none of the most influential thought leaders in the Hawkeye State believe that the Wisconsin governor will sustain his recent bounce in polls .\nThis is one of several intriguing findings in the debut survey of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus . More than 100 of the most plugged-in activists , operatives and elected officials in Iowa and New Hampshire have agreed to answer a weekly survey over the next year , which will be published here every Friday . It \u2019 s a diverse mix of powerful figures from across the political spectrum , including party chairmen , members of Congress , radio hosts and rising stars who command loyal followings .\nThe insiders are immersed in the nomination battles and their views could be a leading indicator of where the polls are heading . The vast majority of those who are participating are not committed to a candidate yet , though some are playing key roles on the burgeoning campaigns .\nThe consensus across this group is that Hillary Clinton is almost guaranteed to become the Democratic nominee . Only four of 70 who answered guessed that a Democrat other than Clinton will ultimately win their state .\nBut there \u2019 s widespread agreement that the GOP field really is wide open . In New Hampshire , the feeling is that Jeb Bush would win the first-in-the-nation primary if it were held this week but that it \u2019 s premature to call him a front-runner .\nSix in 10 Iowa insiders surveyed believe Walker would win the caucuses if they were this week . But only two of the 32 Iowans who returned questionnaires believe the Wisconsin governor will ultimately prevail . \u201c He will now go through a scrutiny that will determine how prepared he is to sustain this front-runner status , \u201d one Iowa Republican remarked .\nHere are the key takeaways from our first weekly survey :\nJeb Bush and Scott Walker are fighting for front-runner status . But neither has it .\nAsked whether there \u2019 s a GOP front-runner , most Republican insiders answered , \u201c no. \u201d The field is stronger than in 2012 , and anyone from a handful of candidates could emerge as the nominee , they believe .\nWalker got a big boost from his breakout speech at an event put on last month by Iowa Rep. Steve King in Des Moines . But the insiders are keenly aware he remains untested outside Wisconsin .\nBush is a bigger media draw , enjoys higher name ID and has access to more money than any other GOP candidate . For these reasons , one New Hampshire Republican said he is the front-runner \u201c simply by default . \u201d\nOthers on the right argued that none of these advantages is enough to make Bush a \u201c real \u201d front-runner in the way that Mitt Romney was at this stage in 2012 . \u201c It \u2019 s too early , \u201d said one of the GOP respondents from New Hampshire . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of kicking of tires yet to happen . \u201d\nAn Iowa Republican remarked , \u201c This is the most wide open contest I have ever seen . \u201d\nThe world matters . At least , a surprisingly high number of insiders think 2016 will be a national security election .\nRoughly half of those interviewed identified the economy \u2014 from stagnant wages to income inequality \u2014 as the defining issue of 2016 . The next most frequently cited issue was foreign policy and/or national security , with about a quarter of those surveyed predicting it will drive the debate .\nSeveral insiders mentioned specifically the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , or ISIL .\nA nonpartisan academic from Iowa said the use-of-force authorization introduced to Congress by President Barack Obama \u201c automatically moves foreign affairs up on this list for 2016 . \u201d\nClinton , as the former secretary of state , will likely position herself as the candidate with unrivaled foreign policy chops . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who looks increasingly serious about running , is playing up his roles on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees .\nRand Paul is winning the GOP ground war . So far .\nHillary Clinton has a built-in , years-in-the-making campaign organization that insiders from both parties agreed is unrivaled . Her 2008 supporters are still with her , and many Obama hands are ready to get on board .\nOn the Republican side , the majority surveyed in both states said Rand Paul has the most robust organization . His father , Ron , finished third in Iowa and second in New Hampshire in 2012 , giving the Kentucky senator a network to build from .\n\u201c Paul probably has the best organization at this point , with good management and strong grass roots , \u201d said a New Hampshire Republican . \u201c Others will catch up and level this out , though . \u201d\nOthers in Iowa mentioned retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , who has benefited from an aggressive movement to draft him into the race , and former Texas Gov . Rick Perry , who has been spending a lot of time in the state .\nDoes being a Bush help or hurt Jeb ? Insiders are split .\nMost Democrats think George W. Bush would be a serious drag on Jeb in a general election . But Republicans are almost evenly divided about whether the Bush name is more of an asset or a liability for the former governor .\n\u201c It is a wash if Jeb gets out and shows he is his own person , \u201d said an uncommitted Iowa Republican .\nAnother said anyone who doesn \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a net positive is \u201c nuts \u201d but added , \u201c Bush fatigue is a real issue . \u201d\nA New Hampshire Republican called it a \u201c two-edge sword \u201d with the grass roots . Another described it as a \u201c net asset in a primary \u201d and a \u201c net liability in the general . \u201d\nIf Rand Paul benefits from his father \u2019 s network , so does Jeb Bush , wrote another Republican respondent from the Hawkeye State . \u201c On one hand , both his Dad and Brother won here , \u201d this person said of Bush . \u201c A lot of activists who were a part of those camps will be a great starting point for an organization . But the name brand isn \u2019 t going to help with conservatives , tea party folks and the liberty crowd . \u201d\nClinton could be America \u2019 s first female president . And one of its oldest . The pols think age could be a bigger potential problem .\nAsked whether the former first lady \u2019 s age or gender is more of a possible liability in the campaign , six in 10 picked her age . Only a handful said gender ; the rest said neither .\n\u201c Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton are the same age , but that won \u2019 t stop someone like , say , Rand Paul , whose father ran for president in his mid-70s , from trying to make it a thing , \u201d said a New Hampshire Democrat .\nAn Iowa Democrat said Clinton \u2019 s gender will be the bigger issue , \u201c but that won \u2019 t manifest till the general election. \u201d Others called the question absurd .\nSeveral Republicans worried that Clinton \u2019 s potential to break the ultimate glass ceiling is a big asset and may draw independent women to her candidacy .\nYes , the inside line has Hillary Clinton walking away with the Democratic nod .\nAlmost no one in either party thinks Clinton won \u2019 t wind up winning both early states . They may want her to spend time on the ground and insist that she \u2019 ll have to earn it , but there are few who doubt that she \u2019 ll win at the end of the day . Clinton finished third in Iowa last time and won an upset in New Hampshire .\n\u201c It seems very unlikely that anyone in the primary field as of now could come near her , \u201d said an Iowa Democrat . \u201c Nobody sees that changing , and Iowa Democrats are equal parts bored and furious about it . \u201d\nThere are varying opinions about who , if anyone , will emerge as Clinton \u2019 s main Democratic challenger . Most Democrats said no one . Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the most frequently mentioned , followed by former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley , ex-Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders . Just one Democrat mentioned Vice President Joe Biden .\nRepublicans see Ted Cruz as likeliest to emerge as the social conservative favorite .\nEvangelicals picked the last two winners of the Iowa caucuses : Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum . Both are running again , but neither can count on the support they had in 2008 and 2012 , respectively . An Iowa Republican predicted that \u201c a firebrand \u201d like the Texas senator is more likely to win over base voters .\nAmong GOP insiders , twice as many picked Cruz to become the leading social conservative candidate as anyone else . But the field is scattered , with nominations for Santorum , Huckabee , Carson , Walker , Rubio , Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal and others .\n\u201c I think in the short term it will be Ted Cruz , \u201d said an Iowa Republican . \u201c In the long term I think a guy like Santorum will emerge again because of his ability to weave \u201d his moral beliefs through an array of social and pocketbook issues .\nA New Hampshire Republican warned against counting out Huckabee : \u201c It depends on how well a campaign [ he ] runs . \u201d\nPolitical chatter this week is all about Scott Walker not having graduated from college . Does it matter ? Our insiders say \u2018 no . \u2019\nThe question of Walker \u2019 s lack of a college degree split respondents : A few more said it will hurt his prospects than said it will help . Several of those who thought it would be a plus remarked it could enhance his \u201c regular guy \u201d image .\nBut very few believe Walker \u2019 s scholastic deficit will move votes .\n\u201c A surprising number of people seem to know Harry Truman pulled it off and the Democratic Party chair here is also without a college degree and the sky has not fallen , \u201d said one New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c The precise circumstances of leaving college \u2014 not the fact of no degree \u2014 could be more problematic to New Hampshire voters if the circumstances are unsavory . \u201d\n\u201c I can \u2019 t wait to see this play out , \u201d said an Iowa Democrat . \u201c I will be terribly disappointed if one of his rivals , or a surrogate , does not put their foot in their mouth on this issue . \u2026 I think it will make him seem more populist . \u201d\nWho \u2019 s a bigger help to Hillary ? Both Democrats and Republicans pick Bill Clinton over Obama .\nThe former president is viewed by both Democrats and Republicans as much more of an asset for Hillary than Obama . Only one of the Democrats surveyed think that he hurts her , although two other Democrats said there are sure to be some moments where he becomes unhelpful \u2014 just as in 2008 .\nAll but a handful of Republicans think having Bill Clinton on the campaign trail helps her .\nAmong 31 Democrats who answered the question , 16 said Obama is an asset , while 7 said he is a liability . The rest said they \u2019 re either unsure or it depends on what happens overseas and with the economy .\n\u201c The president is up and down in New Hampshire like a yo-yo , \u201d said a Democrat there .\n\u201c They should see him as an asset , but I am not sure that they do , \u201d added an Iowa Democrat . \u201c He will win them caucus voters and help solidify her base . \u201d\nMembers of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus ( those who participated this week are bolded ) :\nIowa : Tim Albrecht , Brad Anderson , Rob Barron , Jeff Boeyink , Dave Caris , Sam Clovis , Sara Craig , Jerry Crawford , John Davis , Steve Deace , Derek Eadon , Ed Failor Jr. , Karen Fesler , David Fischer , Doug Gross , Steve Grubbs , Tim Hagle , Bob Haus , Joe Henry , Drew Ivers , Jill June , Lori Jungling , Brian Kennedy , Jake Ketzner , David Kochel , Chris Larimer , Chuck Larson , Jill Latham , Jeff Link , Dave Loebsack , Mark Lucas , Liz Mathis , Jan Michelson , Matt Paul , Marlys Popma , Troy Price , Christopher Rants , Kim Reem , Craig Robinson , Sam Roecker , David Roederer , Nick Ryan , Tamara Scott , Joni Scotter , Karen Slifka , AJ Spiker , Norm Sterzenbach , John Stineman , Matt Strawn , Phil Valenziano , Jessica Vanden Berg , Nate Willems , Eric Woolson , Grant Young\nNew Hampshire : Charlie Arlinghaus , Arnie Arnesen , Patrick Arnold , Rich Ashooh , Dean Barker , Juliana Bergeron , D.J .
