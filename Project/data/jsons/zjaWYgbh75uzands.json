As such , they open up a new legal front in what \u2019 s already a sprawling , complex probe that has ensnared four Trump advisers on other topics .\nBut the new charges don \u2019 t add much to what was already publicly known about exactly how Russians tried to interfere with the campaign \u2014 and they don \u2019 t contain any new allegations about anyone in Trump \u2019 s orbit .\nMueller \u2019 s indictment of 13 Russian people and three Russian companies accuses them of conspiring to interfere with \u201c US political and electoral processes , including the presidential election of 2016. \u201d Later in the day , he also announced a California man named Richard Pinedo had pleaded guilty to an identity fraud charge and become a cooperator , apparently in connection with the Russian charges .\nThe indictment details how Russian trolls churned out pro-Trump content\nThe indictments \u2019 main emphasis , however , is on the propaganda efforts of one Russian group in particular : the Internet Research Agency . That group \u2019 s operations \u2014 which included social media posts , online ads , and organization of rallies in the US \u2014 were , the indictment alleges , often ( but not exclusively ) aimed at denigrating Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential candidacy , and at supporting Donald Trump \u2019 s .\nThe agency existed before the 2016 campaign . In fact , Adrian Chen reported on it in a deeply researched New York Times magazine piece back in June 2015 , calling it a \u201c shadowy organization in St. Petersburg , Russia , that spreads false information on the Internet. \u201d Chen described how the group and its workers used fake social media accounts to spread alarming hoaxes in the US , from a report of a false police shooting of an unarmed black woman , to a fake chemical spill .\nHowever , the indictment alleges that as the presidential primary started heating up in early 2016 , then , the Internet Research Agency increasingly aimed criticism at Clinton and GOP contenders Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio , while supporting Donald Trump \u2014 and Bernie Sanders . An internal document from the group includes : \u201c use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest ( except Sanders and Trump \u2014 we support them ) . \u201d The agency did all this as a part of a larger operation called \u201c Project Lakhta , \u201d which at one point had a monthly budget of over $ 1.25 million ( though it wasn \u2019 t exclusively focused on the US ) .\nAs the general election heated up , the Internet Research Agency allegedly shifted to mainly focus on promoting Trump and opposing Clinton . The indictment claims that in September , one of its workers running a Facebook group called \u201c Secure Borders \u201d was criticized in the document for having a \u201c low number of posts dedicated to criticize Hillary Clinton. \u201d Another part of the effort , the indictment claims , was encouragement of \u201c US minority groups not to vote in the 2016 US presidential election or to vote for a third-party US presidential candidate . \u201d\nHowever , after Trump won , the defendants allegedly helped organize both a pro-Trump and an anti-Trump rally on the same day in New York City , suggesting that one of their aims in promoting Trump \u2019 s candidacy may have simply been to cause chaos in the US .\nThe specific charges against the Russians include one broad \u201c conspiracy to defraud the United States \u201d count , but the rest are far narrower \u2014 one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud , and six counts of identity theft .\nThe trolls likely didn \u2019 t swing the election \u2014 but they \u2019 re low-hanging fruit for charges\nIn a sense , these charges are plucking the low-hanging fruit of Russian interference .\nWhile these social media posts may be objectionable and may have involved violations of federal laws , it \u2019 s highly unlikely that they actually affected the outcome of the election . When put in context with the overall amount of media Americans were exposed to about the 2016 campaign , from a plethora of sources , the Russian efforts were likely a drop in a far larger bucket .\nFurthermore , other allegations of Russian interference \u2014 involving the hacks and leaks of leading Democrats \u2019 emails , and hacking into election-related computer systems in many states \u2014 play no role in these charges .\nAnd importantly , this indictment does not allege that any Americans or anyone on the Trump campaign was aware of or involved in this Russian effort . However , it does allege that some of the Russian defendants posed as US persons and \u201c communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign . \u201d\nIn the wake of the news , liberals are claiming vindication about what they argue is a serious and worrying effort to subvert the democratic process , and conservatives are stressing the lack of new allegations of Russian collusion with Trump .\nBut the bigger picture is that these indictments really don \u2019 t change much about what we know , or tell us much about where Mueller might be going .\nFurthermore , with the Russians charged not being in the United States to face arrest , it \u2019 s unclear what this case will amount to .
