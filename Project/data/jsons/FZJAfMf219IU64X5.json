'' But in a second paragraph , it adds , `` especially : a sense of national consciousness exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups . ''\nLet 's be clear : If the second paragraph is the only definition of nationalism , nationalism is always a bad thing . Furthermore , I acknowledge that this definition is what some people have in mind when they call themselves nationalists .\nAt the same time , even anti-nationalists would have to acknowledge that if the first paragraph is the definition of `` nationalism , '' nationalism can often be a beautiful thing .\nSo , if we are to be honest , the answer to the question of whether nationalism is good or bad is `` How do you define it ? ''\nThe first is `` spirit or aspirations common to the whole nation . ''\nThe second is `` devotion and loyalty to one 's own country ; patriotism . ''\nOnly when we get to the third definition is the definition pejorative : `` excessive patriotism ; chauvinism . ''\nTherefore , a ) based on the competing definitions of the term , b ) assuming both definitions can be true and c ) if intellectual honesty is to govern our discussion , we can reach only one conclusion : There is good nationalism and bad nationalism .\nThat -- not `` nationalism is always good '' or `` nationalism is always bad '' -- is the only accurate assessment .\nTherefore , morally speaking , nationalism is no different from anything else in life .\nThere is moral violence ( in self-defense , in defense of innocents , in defense of a society under unjust attack , etc . ) and immoral violence ( murder of innocents , wars of aggression , etc . ) .\nThere is moral sex ( consensual sex between adults and , in the Judeo-Christian value system , within marriage ) and immoral sex ( such as rape , incest and with a child ) .\nThere is moral use of a gun ( in self-defense , etc . ) and immoral use of a gun ( against an innocent , etc . ) .\nKnives are used morally by chefs and surgeons and immorally by murderers , muggers and torturers .\nEven love must be morally assessed according to context .

Nationalism and racism may be conjoined , as German Nazism did . But they are not definitionally related . While some Americans have conjoined American nationalism with race ( such as the Confederacy , the Ku Klux Klan and currently various fringe `` white identity '' movements ) , American nationalism , based as it is on the motto `` e pluribus unum '' ( `` out of many , one '' ) , by definition includes Americans of all races and ethnicities .
