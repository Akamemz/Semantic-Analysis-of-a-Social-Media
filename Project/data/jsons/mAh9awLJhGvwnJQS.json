It started as an attempt by soldiers and other armed law enforcers to arrest a much-wanted suspect : Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez . His father , Joaqu\u00edn ( aka \u201c El Chapo \u201d ) , once ran the Sinaloa drug gang and is serving a life sentence in an American prison . Chapo junior is thought to lead a faction of the gang , along with his brother . But soon after security forces nabbed him on October 17th , reinforcements from the family business arrived .

Outnumbered , the soldiers let Chapo junior go free .\nThis was a novel kind of failure . Shoot-outs have been commonplace since 2006 , when the then-president , Felipe Calder\u00f3n , mobilised the army to fight drug gangs .
