    "content": "SAN JOSE , Calif.\u2014Firefighter Brian Endicott got an early taste of the pension battle brewing here when a man at the grocery store angrily pointed to the steaks in his cart .\n`` Who do you think you are , wasting taxpayers ' money on a meal like this ? '' the man yelled at 46-year-old Mr. Endicott , who was shopping for dinner with three other firefighters from San Jose Fire Station No . 1 .\nThis June , in a vote that is being closely watched around the U.S. , the mayor of San Jose , Calif. , is asking residents to overhaul pensions of police , firefighters and other city workers . Hear their stories .\nAfter the 2001 terrorist attacks , sympathetic residents of this affluent city gathered at the firehouse to offer flowers , cakes and pies . Today , public sentiment toward the men and women in uniform has widely shifted , as many locals are up in arms over escalating pension costs for public-safety workers .\nIn the current fiscal year ending June 30 , San Jose 's retirement obligations soared to $ 245 million , up from $ 73 million a decade ago , according to the city . For police officers and firefighters who have retired since 2007 , the average pension is $ 95,336 , making them among the most generously compensated in the state .\nSince the recession , dozens of state legislatures and city councils across the U.S. have scaled back benefits and jobs in an attempt to plug gaping budget holes . Safety workers like police and firefighters\u2014who generally earn more than librarians and garbage haulers\u2014have often been spared from some of the most drastic cuts .\nSan Jose Voters Back Pension Overhaul Early results showed voters approving the ballot measure Tuesday that requires city workers to either contribute significantly more to their pensions or to accept more modest benefits . 6/6/2012\n`` There is a sense that these are people who do particularly demanding jobs , '' says Ron Snell , a senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures , who tracks pension changes around the U.S. `` There has been a real reluctance to impose harsher conditions on them . ''\nThat notion is being tested here in San Jose , a Silicon Valley hub that is home to technology giants such as Cisco Systems Inc. , CSCO 0.52 % eBay Inc. EBAY 0.83 % and VeriFone Systems Inc ..\nOn Tuesday , voters here will decide whether to overhaul pensions for all city employees , including about 2,200 public-safety workers . The ballot measure makes San Jose one of only a few places in the U.S. where voters have unilateral power to restructure pensions .\nThe initiative would force current city workers to either contribute more to keep their promised benefits or accept a more modest pension . It would also give the city the right to temporarily suspend cost-of-living raises that retired workers now receive .\nUnlike many other public efforts to rein in costs , the San Jose measure targets the existing pool of employees and retirees , rather than taking the easier path of only cutting benefits for workers yet to be hired . Union representatives say the proposed overhaul violates the contracts the city has negotiated with its workers .\nSimilar pension changes in other states have sparked legal challenges by public employee unions . Last year , judges in Minnesota and Colorado upheld the states ' reduction of cost-of-living raises for retirees .\nIf the San Jose plan passes , city workers\u2014who now give over between 5 % and 11 % of their base pay toward their pensions\u2014could be required to chip in an additional 16 % to keep current benefits levels . Employees who refuse to do so would receive more modest benefits .\nFirefighter Brian Endicott has noticed the public 's anger . Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal\n`` This is not a city where you want to be a firefighter , '' says Mr. Endicott , who says he has seen residents flip the middle finger at his firetruck , which never happened before in his 17-year career .\nIn many cities , police and firefighters are a big driver of retirement cost increases . These workers often are able to call it quits before normal retirement age , which can lengthen their stream of regular payments , municipal officials say . Public-safety workers say they need to retire earlier than others because their jobs are dangerous and physically taxing . Some take other jobs after retirement , though the San Jose mayor 's office does n't track the numbers .\nThe showdown in San Jose ( pop . 958,789 ) , California 's third most-populous city and the 10th-biggest in the U.S. , has its roots in the late 1990s when California lawmakers expanded benefits for workers in the state-run pension plan . To keep up with nearby cities during the dot-com boom , San Jose sweetened its offerings . Police and firefighters got the largest retirement benefits , which climbed to as much as 90 % of a worker 's highest salary , excluding overtime , before retirement , up from 75 % .\nBut ever since the tech-stock bubble burst , San Jose has had a tough time meeting its pricey obligations . The city today has about 1,100 police officers , down 21 % from 1,370 five years ago . Jobs in the parks and recreation department have been cut by 37 % during that period , to 460 from 753 . Four new libraries , financed in better times , are sitting empty because city officials say they have no money to operate them .\nChuck Reed , the city 's Democratic mayor , elected in 2006 , says stratospheric pension costs are largely to blame for the problems . `` We love our cops and firefighters . They are our heroes , '' Mr. Reed says . But , he adds , `` they 've lost a lot of that support in recent years . ''\nWilma Hashii , a library advocate , at the Bascom Library/Community center , favors reduced benefits . Brian L. Frank for The Wall Stre\nWilma Hashii typifies that mood . `` They do n't need 90 % of their salary when they retire , '' says the retired library clerk . `` I understand their job is stressful . But most of us are feeling pretty stressed financially right now . ''\nThe city had a $ 115 million deficit in the latest fiscal year , San Jose 's 10th year in a row in the red . Pensions were the biggest drain , says the mayor 's office . Of the $ 79 million in increased costs , retirement expenditures accounted for $ 58 million .\nScott Castruita , a 50-year-old retired patrol sergeant , says he earned what he collects . During his career , he broke several bones in his right hand fighting a suspect and dislocated his left knee knocking down a door . A frantic mother once pleaded for him to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a 9-month-old boy . He complied , he says , even though he knew the baby was dead .\n`` I did this because it was an honorable job , '' says Mr. Castruita . But tensions eventually flared to the point `` where you walked out and felt dirty , '' he says .\nAnxiety among U.S. voters over unemployment , lower housing values and investment losses have emboldened government leaders to roll back pensions of even the most popular government workers , says Tracy Gordon , a fellow at the Brookings Institution . Some officials have also sought to restrict public-safety workers ' contract-negotiating powers\u2014in some places for the first time .\nIn September , voters in Hollywood , Fla. , approved large cuts in pensions for police , firefighters and other city workers .\nFarther north , Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee has proposed bills that would allow certain financially troubled cities to reduce disability pensions that firefighters and police officers can collect if they are injured on the job .\n`` I have been at this for 40 years and I have never seen an assault on our fundamental rights as I have seen in the last 14 months , '' says Harold Schaitberger , general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters .\nU.S. public-safety workers were among the first civil servants to receive pensions , and they often collect larger benefits than many other public employees , municipal officials say . In San Jose , for instance , recently retired municipal workers collected an average of $ 42,460\u2014far less than the average of $ 95,336 for safety workers . Workers who retired earlier get less . Public-safety workers point out they contribute about twice as much to their pensions as other workers , and they have to work 30 years to collect a pension worth 90 % of their pay . Like other workers , they have also agreed to large pay cuts in recent years .\nMany city employees can cash out unused sick and vacation days when they leave the job . But while the payouts have been capped or eliminated for most , they are unlimited for longtime cops and firefighters . One police official in San Jose who retired last year , collected $ 264,000 for unused sick and vacation time , according to city records .\nMayor Chuck Reed says pension costs are a drain on San Jose 's budget . Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal\nPolice and firefighters say they have been willing to negotiate changes to their pensions to help ease the city 's budget crunch , but they have also claimed that the mayor has exaggerated the problem .\nEarlier this year , hundreds of public employees signed an ethics complaint against Mr. Reed , saying he misled voters when he claimed in a news release that pension costs could jump to $ 650 million in fiscal year 2015-16 , up from $ 245 million in the current fiscal year .\nMr. Reed wrote in a letter to the Election Commission that he cited the $ 650 million as an estimate `` if things got worse . '' The current estimate by the retirement board 's actuary is roughly $ 320 million .\nUnions representing city workers also questioned why Mr. Reed took the pension measure to voters when the city projects a surplus of about $ 10 million in the new fiscal year starting July 1 . Retirement costs are expected to remain flat , and the additional funds should allow the city to open some libraries and community centers , according to the mayor 's office .\nMr. Reed has said he expects retirement costs coming from the general fund to increase by $ 29 million in the fiscal year starting July 2013 , contributing to another budget deficit . He maintains that cutting pension costs is the only feasible way to restore additional city services .\nIn late March , the city got a jolt when Moody 's Investors Service cut its ratings on San Jose 's general obligation bonds to Aa1 from Aaa , citing the `` multiyear erosion of the city 's general fund reserves . '' The city 's management is `` being significantly challenged to manage retirement costs and faces arduous barriers to reduce the impact of those obligations , '' Moody 's said in its report .\n`` It was a reality check , '' says city council member Pierluigi Oliverio , who supports the pension ballot measure .\nSan Jose is home to a mix of ethnic and income groups , including tech executives from Silicon Valley and a fast-growing Vietnamese population . Roughly one in three households earns more than $ 100,000 . Many people say they moved here because of the low crime rate and inexpensive homes . When the housing market was thriving in the middle of the last decade , city property values soared . Prices have dropped 40 % since their peak in 2007 , or slightly more than the national median .\nAgainst this demographic backdrop , the current pension battle has divided San Jose into two philosophical camps .\nCharles Jones Jr. , a 52-year-old business manager at Apple Inc. , AAPL 2.59 % supports an overhaul of the pension system partly because of safety concerns in the area . Across the city , in the first three months of the year , burglaries and break-in attempts increased 37 % from the same period in 2011 , according to local officials . Like many other residents , Mr. Jones would rather return more police to the street than maintain the retirement status quo .\n`` People recognize the importance '' of police , he says . `` But how much are we willing to pay for public safety and at what cost\u2014at the expense of community centers , parks and potholes ? ''\nOthers , meanwhile , worry that police officers and firefighters are being turned into scapegoats because they are the city 's most visible employees earning the largest pensions . Some residents question whether pensions are really the biggest cause of the city 's financial problems .\nSteve Kline , a lawyer who is running for city council , objects to a provision in the ballot measure that could force police and firefighters who are injured on the job to keep working instead of getting disability retirement benefits . He also worries that the pension changes could cost the city hundreds of thousands in legal fees defending a likely court challenge by the unions .\n`` Instead of trying to solve this by working together with the unions , the mayor said ' I am going to shut down city services and blame it on pensions so people will buy my economic reform ideas . ' ``\nMr. Kline says city officials should look for savings in other parts of the budget , including renegotiating deals with outside contractors . The mayor 's spokeswoman says the city is regularly seeking ways to save money on contractors .\nIn a city where public-safety workers earn an average of $ 109,000 , and other workers collect an average of $ 69,000 , police and firefighters are having a tough time winning over voters . They are also up against a detective who supports the pension rollback and is running for another city council seat .\nA view of San Jose as seen from Mayor Chuck Reed 's offices . Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal\n`` Some people believe I am betraying the police , '' says Tam Truong , a 30-year-old mayoral candidate . He says he finds such charges hurtful . He decided to enter the race partly because he 's upset about the reduction in police staffing , which he believes has emboldened criminals . He says his own home was burglarized recently .\n`` I am a cop . I am pro-police . I want more officers on the street , and I want them compensated , '' says Mr. Truong . `` But the question is , 'What is reasonable ? ' I 'd rather have a job than a pension . ''\nMayor Reed hosted a campaign fundraiser for Mr. Truong in February .\nPeople like Mr. Castruita , the retired San Jose police officer , are already learning to deal with the controversy over benefits .\nMr. Castruita receives an annual pension of $ 106,000 , plus a 3 % increase every year . He was owed $ 91,000 for unused vacation and sick time when he retired in August , according to city records .\nIf the June vote passes , the city council would have the power under certain circumstances to eliminate yearly pension benefit increases .\nMr. Castruita grew up in San Jose and earned a nickel from a local vineyard owner for every squirrel he killed with his rifle . As the city boomed , he could n't afford to live here , and moved to nearby Gilroy in 1988 . San Jose 's median home value is currently $ 407,000 , or more than double the U.S. median .\nHe says his pay never came close to earning the cash and stock options his friends got from local technology companies . They questioned why he did such a physically and emotionally difficult job for less pay , he says .\nSo Mr. Castruita was floored last year when some of those same friends complained that his police pension cost too much .\n`` They said I am too young to retire , '' he says . `` I told them , 'It 's a young man 's game . How many police officers do you want out there in their 50s ? ' ``",
