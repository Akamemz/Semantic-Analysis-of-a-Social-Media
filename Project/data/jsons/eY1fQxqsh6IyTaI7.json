    "content": "When George W. Bush nominated John Bolton to be his ambassador to the United Nations in 2005 , it was cathartic for many conservatives , who had been stewing for years over the bureaucracy at Turtle Bay . A working-class guy from Baltimore with a Yosemite Sam mustache , Bolton had once opined that if U.N. headquarters `` lost 10 stories , it would n't make a bit of difference . '' It was easy to imagine him hurling abuse and possibly heavy objects at gelatinous U.N. functionaries as they fled down the hallway .\nAlas , Senate Democrats filibustered Bolton 's nomination , limiting him to a recess appointment . His term was brief , controversial , and idealistic , as he set about trying to reform the U.N. 's farcical and mass murderer-dominated Human Rights Commission , which earned him rare praise from the New York Times . So when Donald Trump announced he was mulling Bolton to be his secretary of state , it seemed like a solid pick . Who would n't want a sworn foe of bureaucracy at the cumbersome State Department ?\nThe problem with Bolton is n't his aversion to the UN , but his penchant for counterproductive war . Whereas Trump , for all his faults , has laid out a foreign policy that attempts to correct some of the mistakes of the past ( even if it ultimately replaces them with new ones ) , Bolton remains immersed in the failed thinking of the Bush administration .\nOn the calamitous invasion of Iraq , he remains steadfast . `` I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct , '' he told the Washington Examiner last year , and anyway , `` you ca n't assume if [ Saddam ] had stayed in power , sweetness and light would prevail in the Middle East today . '' That 's true , but you can assume that if Saddam had been removed from power , mayhem and madness would prevail in the Middle East\u2014because that 's exactly what happened .\nBolton 's support for regime change has remained a constant . In March 2011 , he declared that the United States should assassinate Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi and `` end the regime right there . '' At the time , Gaddafi had surrendered his WMDs and was aiding the war on terror ; after the Obama administration destroyed his government , Libya disintegrated into anarchy and ISIS opened up shop . The president , guilty of taking Bolton 's advice , was later excoriated by Bolton for being weak on Libya .\nOn Iran , Bolton 's prescription was to drop bombs , and then , once that was accomplished , to drop more bombs\u2014all of it `` aimed at regime change in Tehran . '' Heeding his counsel would have torn open a vacuum as Iranian moderate and hardline elements duked it out to replace the deposed government , and the Islamic State would have attempted to fill the space , eager to strike at the heart of Shiite Islam . It also would have crippled the anti-ISIS campaign in Iraq , which is heavily dependent on Iran-linked militias .\nThe goal of bombing Iran 's nuclear program , Bolton wrote , was , `` rendering inoperable the Natanz and Fordow uranium-enrichment installations and the Arak heavy-water production facility and reactor . '' Today , all those sites are subject to daily weapons inspections , Fordow is being converted into a research center , and Arak has been filled with concrete , all thanks to diplomacy , not war .\nStill , at least Bolton was merely advocating conventional ordnance against Iran and not thermonuclear war . During a speech in 2009 , he said , `` Unless Israel is prepared to use nuclear weapons against Iran 's program , Iran will have nuclear weapons in the very near future . '' He was wrong again : Israel did n't nuke Iran and Iran today does n't have nukes .\nEven when Bolton finds a way around destructive policies , he still manages to lasso his ankles in the process . `` I would vote against an authorization to use force , '' he said in 2013 of the Obama administration 's plan to attack Syria 's Bashar al-Assad .
