    "content": "Parliament will be suspended just days after MPs return to work in September - and only a few weeks before the Brexit deadline .\nBoris Johnson said a Queen 's Speech would take place after the suspension , on 14 October , to outline his `` very exciting agenda '' .\nBut it means the time MPs have to pass laws to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October would be cut .\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was a `` constitutional outrage '' .\nThe Speaker , who does not traditionally comment on political announcements , continued : `` However it is dressed up , it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [ suspending Parliament ] now would be to stop [ MPs ] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country . ''\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said : `` Suspending Parliament is not acceptable , it is not on . What the prime minister is doing is a smash and grab on our democracy to force through a no deal , '' he said .\nHe said when MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday , `` the first thing we 'll do is attempt legislation to prevent what [ the PM ] is doing '' , followed by a vote of no confidence `` at some point '' .\nHundreds of protesters gathered in Westminster on Wednesday evening chanting `` stop the coup '' and carrying anti-Brexit placards and EU flags .\nThe demonstration , which was organised hours beforehand , started outside Parliament before spreading towards Downing Street .\nAt the scene , BBC correspondent Richard Galpin described the atmosphere as peaceful and lively .\nHe said `` good-natured '' protesters on College Green broke through barriers which had been in place to separate live TV crews from members of the public - before traffic on Parliament Square was blocked by some people who sat down in the road .\nSeveral protesters he spoke to indicated this was only the beginning of the disruption , with more demonstrations being organised for the weekend .\nThree Conservative members of the Queen 's Privy Council took the request to suspend Parliament to the monarch 's Scottish residence in Balmoral on Wednesday morning on behalf of the prime minister .\nIt has now been approved , allowing the government to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday 9 September and no later than Thursday 12 September , until Monday 14 October .\nLeader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg , who was at the meeting with the Queen , said the move was a `` completely proper constitutional procedure . ''\nEarlier , Mr Johnson said suggestions the suspension was motivated by a desire to force through a no deal were `` completely untrue '' .\nHe said he did not want to wait until after Brexit `` before getting on with our plans to take this country forward '' , and insisted there would still be `` ample time '' for MPs to debate the UK 's departure .\n`` We need new legislation . We 've got to be bringing forward new and important bills and that 's why we are going to have a Queen 's Speech , '' Mr Johnson added .\nShutting down Parliament - known as prorogation - happens after the prime minister advises the Queen to do it .\nThe decision to do it now is highly controversial because opponents say it would stop MPs being able to play their full democratic part in the Brexit process .\nA number of high profile figures , including former Prime Minister John Major , have threatened to go to the courts to stop it , and a legal challenge led by the SNP 's justice spokeswoman , Joanna Cherry , is already working its way through the Scottish courts .\nAfter the announcement , Sir John said he had `` no doubt '' Mr Johnson 's motive was to `` bypass a sovereign Parliament that opposes his policy on Brexit '' , and he would continue to seek legal advice .\nBBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it was established precedent to prorogue Parliament before a Queen 's Speech , albeit generally more briefly , and rarely , if ever , at such a constitutionally charged time .\nHe said it was `` Her Majesty 's Government '' in name only and it was her role to take the advice of her ministers , so she would prorogue Parliament if asked to .\nIt is not possible to mount a legal challenge to the Queen 's exercise of her personal prerogative powers .\nBut anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - who previously won a legal battle against ministers over Article 50 - has made a judicial review application to the courts about Mr Johnson 's decision .\nShe told the BBC 's Clive Coleman : `` If the intention of using this prorogation - and the effect - is that it limits Parliament sovereignty , then we believe that 's illegal and unconstitutional . ''\nThis has been an extraordinarily long Parliamentary session , and governments have the right to shut up shop and return to announce their proposals in a new one , with all the golden carriages , fancy Westminster costumes , banging of doors and splendour that goes with it .\nBut that new timetable means Parliament will be suspended for longer than had been expected - it 's only a matter of days , but those are days that might matter enormously .\nBoris Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he 'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU at Halloween , so this decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him .\nBut some others in his government are worried - moving now , even with the accompanying controversy , he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides .\nThe PM says he wants to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal , but it is `` do or die '' and he is willing to leave without one rather than miss the deadline .\nThat position has prompted a number of opposition MPs to come together to try to block a possible no deal , and on Tuesday they announced that they intended to use parliamentary process to do so .\nBut with Parliament set to be suspended , opponents have only a few days next week to push for their changes .\nSenior Tory backbencher and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said the move by Mr Johnson could lead to a vote of no confidence - something opposition parties have left on the table as another option to stop no deal .\n`` There is plenty of time to do that if necessary [ and ] I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional , '' he said .\nScotland 's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week , or `` today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy '' .\nMr Johnson has written to MPs to outline his plan , adding : `` There will be a significant Brexit legislative programme to get through but that should be no excuse for a lack of ambition ! ''\nHe mentioned the NHS , tackling crime , infrastructure investment and the cost of living as important issues .\nHe also called on Parliament to show `` unity and resolve '' in the run up to the 31 October so the government `` stands a chance of securing a new deal '' with the EU .\nBut a senior EU source told the BBC 's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming the bloc 's position was clear and was not contingent on the machinations of the UK Parliament .\nThere has been considerable anger at Mr Johnson 's move from across the political spectrum .\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats , Jo Swinson , said it was a `` dangerous and unacceptable course of action '' .\n`` He knows the people would not choose a no deal and that elected representatives would n't allow it . He is trying to stifle their voices , '' she said .\nThe leader of the SNP in Westminster , Ian Blackford , accused Mr Johnson of `` acting like a dictator '' , while First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said he wanted to `` close the doors '' on democracy .\nConservative Party Chairman James Cleverly said setting out a legislative programme via a Queen 's Speech was what `` all new governments do '' .\nUS President Donald Trump tweeted his support for Mr Johnson , saying it `` would be very hard '' for Mr Corbyn to seek a no-confidence vote against the PM , `` especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the UK has been looking for '' .\nBrexit Party MEP Alex Phillips said MPs `` only had themselves to blame '' for the move .\nShe told \u2588\u2588\u2588 : `` They have made themselves the obstacle in front of delivering the referendum result .
