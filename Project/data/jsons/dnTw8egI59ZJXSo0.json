    "content": "A big new State Department assessment has identified a major threat to global security . It 's not ISIS or Vladimir Putin . It 's not a rickety global economy or climate change or the threat of global pandemics .\nInstead , the report argues , these individual problems are symptoms of a much bigger issue \u2014 namely , a slow breakdown in global governance . Many of the institutions that were created in the past century to deal with economic and security risks around the world , such as the UN and IMF , may no longer be adequate to the task .\nIf the authors of the report are right , then the world 's biggest problems are all really about this one big thing .\nThe world 's institutions are no longer adequate for today 's problems\nThe report , called the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review , was tasked with a broad review of State Department policies . The point was `` not looking at the crisis of the day , '' Tom Perriello , the State Department official tasked with leading the QDDR , said in a press briefing . Instead , the report is `` trying to connect the dots across the crises , and then saying what can we learn across the dynamics that we can see . ''\nMuch of what the report 's authors saw was quite good . `` Seventy years ago , a bipartisan group of visionary Americans forged a system of modern international institutions , as well as economic and security arrangements , aimed at preventing another catastrophic world war and addressing acute human suffering , '' they write . `` This system enabled the peaceful end of the Cold War , a wave of democratization , and unprecedented improvement in the basic human condition around the globe . ''\nThat 's all true . But the QDDR worries that these institutions \u2014 things like the UN and the IMF \u2014 are n't adequate for dealing with the specific kinds of problems we see today . The UN may help the big countries cooperate with each other , but it ca n't stop ISIS or Syria 's civil war .

'' Sometimes , it 's because a hostile power is actively challenging them \u2014 Russia , for example , is actively trying to weaken the NATO-dominated regional order in Europe .\nOther times , it 's that these institutions are having trouble developing good answers for particular kind of problems . It 's not clear , for example , how global institutions can repair failed states and stop civil wars in places like Libya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .\nRegardless , the basic point is the same : the institutions that have made the world the safest and most prosperous place it 's ever been are becoming less capable of following through on their mission .

But what 's interesting about their position in the QDDR is that they seem to represent the US government 's actual view about the world 's biggest problems .\nIt 's no accident that the QDDR 's section on priorities begins with a quote from Obama 's 2014 speech to the UN General Assembly \u2014 the address was framed around an almost identical diagnosis about the need to reform global institutions in light of new challenges . `` If we lift our eyes beyond our borders , if we think globally and act cooperatively , '' Obama said , `` we can shape the course of this century as our predecessors shaped the post\u2013World War II age . '' Sound familiar ?\nBut the QDDR goes beyond Obama 's speech . It identifies four areas \u2014 preventing violent conflict and extremism , spreading democracy , promoting global economic growth , and climate change \u2014 in which the State Department needs to focus its efforts . `` Each of these priorities is based on the need for better governance across the world , '' Secretary of State John Kerry said at a presser . `` They 're all linked .

The QDDR , as an exercise , is designed to improve the way the State Department works as an organization .
