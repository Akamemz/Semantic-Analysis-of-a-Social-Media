    "content": "\u201c As election security experts have pointed out , fraud is exceptionally rare , hard to commit without getting caught and nearly impossible to do on the scale necessary to affect election results\u2026 [ Moreover ] Looking at voters by political party , we find that [ turnout among ] Democrats and Republicans [ increased ] about the same amount : around 8 percentage points\u2026 \u201c For most voters , mail voting is not a partisan issue . The reform draws strong support among both Democratic and Republican voters , according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll . Support is even stronger among Democrats and Republicans living in states that already have all-mail voting . All-mail voting appears to be that rarest of democracy reforms : a shift that helps everyone get more involved , that reduces inequities and that attracts support across parties \u2014 if only at the grass-roots level\u2026 At this point , the burden of argument regarding the merit of mail voting should be on its opponents , not its proponents. \u201d Charlotte Hill , Jacob Grumbach , Adam Bonica , and Hakeem Jefferson , New York Times\nRegarding voting procedures in November , \u201c No one knows how difficult in-person voting will be by the fall , but states should prepare for the worst \u2014 and Congress should immediately provide emergency funding , with up to $ 2 billion needed . I \u2019 d support such spending because democracy is worth spending money on \u2026 No one wants the uncertainty of an extended contested election with complaints like those we heard about the recent Wisconsin primary or the Iowa caucuses in February. \u201d Jonathan Bernstein , Bloomberg\nRegarding the sexual assault allegations against Biden , \u201c If you thought that the evidence against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was sufficient to deny him confirmation to a seat on the Supreme Court , are you a hypocrite if you don \u2019 t think the Reade allegations are enough to mean that Biden should not be president ? \u2026 \u201c This is not an ordinary political contest against an ordinary incumbent . Ensuring that Trump does not enjoy another four years in office may be enough to justify egregious hypocrisy , but it would be hypocrisy , nonetheless . Democrats and feminists should be hesitant to expose themselves , once again , to accusations that their horror over sexual harassment and assault is purely situational\u2026 If \u2014 underscore , if \u2014 it becomes clear or even likely that Biden engaged in the behavior that Reade alleges , there must be a serious conversation about whether he can be the Democratic nominee . \u201d Ruth Marcus , Washington Post\n\u201c For better or worse , the first Twitter president is a master at using social media to frame the daily debate and news coverage . Mr. Trump \u2019 s flair for the outrageous helps drive that attention . In contrast , Mr. Biden \u2019 s temperance and decorum are relative strengths . But civility isn \u2019 t particularly well-suited to social media\u2026 \u201c Still , with creative and timely interventions , Mr. Biden can turn the tables on Mr. Trump . To do this , the challenger needs to behave more like an insurgent , building the capacity to wield facts , humor and mockery at lightning speed in those surreal moments of opportunity that Mr. Trump regularly provides . ( Simple example : a Biden video , fired off in real time : \u2018 This is a cup of Lysol . It is poison . Please do not drink it \u2019 ) \u2026 Every day , Mr. Trump provides opportunities . It isn \u2019 t hard to get a rise out of this thin-skinned president and knock him off his game . Be a speedboat , not a battleship . Make him react to you. \u201d David Axelrod and David Plouffe , New York Times\n\u201c The polls clearly show that Biden is ahead and by a larger margin than Hillary Clinton was on the eve of the 2016 election\u2026 [ Yet ] An average of recent polls finds that a majority of voters ( about 55 % ) believe that Trump will defeat Biden in the election . Trump 's edge on this question has remained fairly consistent over time . A majority or plurality of voters thought he 'd be re-elected in a February Fox News poll and a September 2019 Marist College poll . During none of these periods was Trump ahead when pollsters asked voters who they would vote for\u2026 \u201c It seems Americans have probably overreacted to the 2016 result . They do n't trust the numbers that are in front of them . Americans think the polls are underestimating Republicans\u2026 That may be the case , but it seems like a bad bet given that polls did pretty well in 2018 . My advice would be that in gauging the electorate , you should n't be of the mindset that Trump is going to pull it out if the polls continue to suggest he wo n't . Even Trump 's own polling reportedly has him behind . Trump 's a politician , not a magician . \u201d Harry Enten , CNN\n\u201c Leaders in most peer countries saw big increases in their Morning Consult polling numbers by mid-April compared to a month earlier\u2026 Canada \u2019 s Justin Trudeau has seen a 16-point bump ; Scott Morrison of Australia a 25-point increase ; even the largely unpopular French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron has seen his job approval rise 8 points\u2026 \u201c Why has Trump \u2019 s approval bump been so small relative to most other leaders at home and abroad ? ... We live in a polarized political era , but structural polarization is probably not the primary factor driving down Trump \u2019 s approval bump. \u201d Roge Karma , Vox\nThe right argues that the coronavirus has impacted Trump \u2019 s chance at re-election but sees Biden as a weak candidate , and worries that increased use of mail-in ballots could result in fraud .\nThe right argues that the coronavirus has impacted Trump \u2019 s chance at re-election but sees Biden as a weak candidate , and worries that increased use of mail-in ballots could result in fraud .\n\u201c The public is , by and large , not willing to blame the virus on Donald Trump . It wasn \u2019 t his fault that we were hit with this pandemic . But much like the captain of a ship that strikes an iceberg when he \u2019 s asleep in his cabin , President Trump will be judged on how we respond as a country . If the economy is still largely in the tank at the end of October and people are still dropping from COVID-19 in shocking numbers , the results of the \u2018 referendum \u2019 will be clear and I wouldn \u2019 t bet a plugged nickel on Trump \u2019 s chances of victory\u2026\n\u201c But if we manage to make it through the worst part of this wave and appear to be heading back toward the economy we enjoyed up until a couple of months ago , the President should be well situated . \u201d\n\u201c A new Emerson College poll shows that Trump supporters are far more enthusiastic about voting for their preferred candidate than Biden supporters\u2026 The Democratic Party has had since November 8 , 2016 , to work on its plan for securing the presidency this year . With so much time , one would think that its 2020 strategy would be hard to beat . But instead of offering an inspiring fresh face and bold plans , the best it can do is more of the same in the form of an elder statesman surrounded by a long list of concerns\u2026\n\u201c The Democratic Party is certain that Trump is an existential threat . Curiously , it is not giving the 2020 election its best shot . Its collective inability to prepare sufficiently is most likely due to its obsession with Trump 's every word , deed , and tweet . From the start of his term , there was talk of Russian collusion , impeachment , and the like . It was so sure that it would be able to oust him long before November 2020 , that the months and years crept up on it . Then the new election season arrived , Biden ended up at the top , and together , they pretend that this is what they 've wanted all along . \u201d\n\u201c The great ray of sunshine in the Trump camp is one Joe Biden of Delaware . Trump may be facing ugly polls , economic catastrophe , and a biblical plague on the land , but he also is almost certainly facing Joe Biden on Election Day . Biden , who is struggling under allegations that he sexually assaulted Tara Reade , a former aide , has named former senator Chris Dodd to head his vice-presidential search committee . This is political malpractice\u2026\n\u201c Chris Dodd \u2019 s Joe Biden problems are worse than Joe Biden \u2019 s Joe Biden problems , and they include an account of then\u2013Senator Dodd and Senator Ted Kennedy sexually assaulting a waitress , in public . This is not a story from some right-wing fringe blogger \u2014 this was from Michael Kelly , writing at the time for GQ\u2026 The less obvious problem with the Dodd arrangement is that Biden and other Democratic leaders are overwhelmingly rich , old , and white in a party that isn \u2019 t . Promising to put a woman on the ticket \u2014 but only if she gets the stamp of approval from a 75-year-old white male millionaire party hack \u2014 is a dramatic illustration of where the real power still is held in the Democratic Party . \u201d\nRegarding voting procedures in November , \u201c Concerns about fraud in mail-in ballots were serious enough that a 2008 report produced by the CalTech/MIT Voting Technology Project recommended that states \u2018 restrict or abolish on-demand absentee voting in favor of in-person early voting. \u2019 ... A significant increase in mail-in voting this fall could greatly incentivize \u2018 ballot harvesting , \u2019 where third parties collect mail-in ballots on behalf of voters and deliver them to election officials . There \u2019 s long been a consensus that such a practice incentivizes fraud , and ballot harvesting is illegal in most of the country\u2026\n\u201c In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by garnering over 2.8 million more votes than Donald Trump . But nearly 6 million unaccounted mail-in ballots were never counted in 2016 , more than twice her margin in the popular vote . The potential to affect elections by chasing down unused mail-in ballots and [ making ] sure they get counted \u2013 using methods that may or may not be legal \u2013 is great . \u201d",
