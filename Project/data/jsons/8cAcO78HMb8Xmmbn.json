    "content": "Rep. Mark Amodei ( R-NV ) , Nevada \u2019 s only Republican U.S. House member , confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Saturday afternoon in an exclusive phone interview that media and leftist claims that he supports an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d are inaccurate : he does not support an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d into President Donald Trump .\n\u201c Right , \u201d Amodei told \u2588\u2588\u2588 when asked to confirm he does not support an impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats are now conducting into President Trump .\n\u201c You \u2019 re sitting there going wow , look at this guy \u2019 s history , \u201d Amodei said in an exclusive interview on Saturday . \u201c I \u2019 m not a household name or anything like that , so you think I just lost my mind one day and ate some loco weed and called all the Nevada people in and said , \u2018 Here we go \u2019 ? I guess the reason I \u2019 m not phenomenally agitated or whatever is is quite frankly I think that Humberto Sanchez \u2019 s article was fair and accurate . There \u2019 s confusion throughout the nation between what we did with the UC to send it to the appropriate committees , which the White House supports , and what Pelosi is doing . So it would certainly be news if that \u2019 s what I was saying I was in favor of . We got into some discussions about \u2018 what ifs \u2019 and it \u2019 s like hey , let the committees do their work and see where it leads . Wherever it leads , it leads\u2014let the chips fall where they may . But how you get from that discussion in context to \u2018 Oh my god he supports Pelosi \u2019 s thing \u2019 is not true . \u201d\nWhat he does support is what every other member of the House of Representatives and the Senate\u2014in addition to the White House\u2014supports , which is a resolution that passed both the House and Senate unanimously with White House backing earlier this week calling for the so-called \u201c whistleblower complaint \u201d and other information to be transmitted to the relevant congressional committees . In the House , that was H. Res 576 . It passed the House 421-0 . Amodei told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he has been misquoted by many in the national media who say that means he supports an \u201c impeachment inquiry , \u201d but that he does not support one .\n\u201c No , \u201d Amodei again told \u2588\u2588\u2588 when asked if he supports what Pelosi and Democrats are doing in what they call an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d through the various House committees including the Intelligence , Judiciary , Foreign Affairs , Financial Services , and other committees .\nSeveral national media outlets have raced Amodei \u2019 s comments out into the public sphere to use them to create the appearance of dissent in GOP ranks when it comes to Pelosi \u2019 s \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d of the president . Among them are the New York Times , MSNBC , CBS News , and several others who claim Amodei became the first Republican to support an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d of Trump . But Amodei , in a lengthy interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Saturday afternoon , confirmed that no he does not support an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d of Trump and in fact does not have a position that is different from the White House or other Republicans in Congress at this point .\nThe way this all started was Amodei , in the interest of transparency with his local in-state media , held a press call on Friday to explain where he was on all of the news this week in Washington .\n\u201c We did this news conference at the end of the week via telephone because quite frankly I hadn \u2019 t said much about it , \u201d Amodei told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Some of the Nevada outlets were like hey , so we said here \u2019 s the conference call-in let \u2019 s do a call . We did a conference call . Tt lasted about 40 minutes ; I \u2019 m sure there are tapes of it from people who participated . So it \u2019 s like hey , you can listen to the tapes to form your own opinion . But I don \u2019 t think it was a close call throughout the 40 minutes , it was that I support the resolution that came through UC [ unanimous consent ] in the Senate , I support the resolution that we did in the House earlier in the week that basically got rid of all the Pelosi poison-pill stuff and they changed it to mirror the Senate wording exactly . The White House supports it . I support it too . I \u2019 m a process guy , let \u2019 s send it to the committees and see what it \u2019 s all about . So you \u2019 re like what the heck are you talking about for \u2018 it \u2019 ? \u2018 It \u2019 is all this recent stuff for transcripts and quid pro quo and Ukraine and all that other sort of stuff\u2014that \u2019 s it . I support this thing that has 535 other votes and the White House \u2019 s support . \u201d\nThe Nevada Independent published an article about it all . It explained the congressman \u2019 s position on it , and he has no issue with that article . What he does have an issue with is other people using it to claim he supports an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d like what Pelosi is doing when he does not support any such thing\u2014and has no different position from the rest of the Republicans in the House .\nAn \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d is what Pelosi has announced the Democrats are doing\u2014something most Democrats have announced they agree with\u2014not the bipartisan , unanimously-backed oversight investigations that are perfunctory and normal in Washington as part of the unanimous resolutions .\nAlso , Amodei , on both Wednesday and Friday before Congress broke for the two-week recess it is currently on , voted with all the Republicans in the House in favor of a resolution from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to express disapproval with the way in which Pelosi had launched Democrats \u2019 impeachment proceedings against Trump . All the Democrats voted against it .\nNonetheless , the New York Times added him to a column in a list it is keeping , saying he is the first Republican to support an \u201c impeachment inquiry. \u201d Several others in national media have pushed the same inaccuracy , which all forced Amodei to issue a statement on Friday night further clarifying he is not in favor of impeachment of Trump and explaining the investigations . But many in media have still not corrected their inaccurate claims he supports an \u201c impeachment inquiry , \u201d to the point where Amodei has even directed his staff to contact the New York Times and pull him out of the list of members supporting an \u201c impeachment inquiry . \u201d\nThe first Republican House member has announced support for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump : Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada See the full list : https : //t.co/nnYylNUBSA pic.twitter.com/7SUfyj48Sq \u2014 The New York Times ( @ nytimes ) September 27 , 2019\n\u201c We asked them to take it down out of the column , \u201d Amodei told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We gave them a real simple ask this morning . They got columns on who \u2019 s in , who \u2019 s out , et cetera . I had my comms person who you \u2019 ve been talking to send them an email and say , \u2018 Hey this is not accurate , please take him out of that column. \u2019 I \u2019 m shocked she \u2019 s gotten crickets so far , which I expect she will continue to get .

But in these times , the fact that the New York Times says quite frankly means \u2018 better check further . \u2019 \u201d\nThe Times has not backed down , and continues to\u2014even though it is aware the inclusion of Amodei in this column is inaccurate\u2014keep him included in it . Multiple inquiries from \u2588\u2588\u2588 to New York Times spokeswomen Eileen Murphy and Danielle Rhoades-Ha have not been returned , but both\u2014as well as newspaper editorial staff\u2014are aware Amodei does not support an \u201c impeachment inquiry , \u201d and still the newspaper will not correct the error .\nAmodei \u2019 s staff has asked the Times multiple times to correct the inaccuracy , but its staff refuses to do so , even though the Times knows it is not correct .\nFor Amodei , he \u2019 s not even that upset or surprised given the hyper-charged political atmosphere and the media \u2019 s transparent hatred of Trump .
