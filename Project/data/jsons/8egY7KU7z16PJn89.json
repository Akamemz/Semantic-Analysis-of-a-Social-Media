    "content": "The United States and the European Union announced another round of sanctions against Russia on Monday and Tuesday : the Americans against Russians close to President Vladimir Putin , including the president of the state-owned oil company Rosneft ; and the Europeans against senior Russian officials and secessionist leaders in Ukraine . The stated reason is that Russia has fulfilled none of the commitments it made at a meeting with Ukraine , the United States and the European Union in Geneva on April 17 , and that Russia \u2019 s \u201c involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable . \u201d\nThe action is justified , and for all of Mr. Putin \u2019 s bluster , the economic uncertainty generated by sanctions is accelerating Russia \u2019 s slide to recession . The same Russians who are cheering Mr. Putin on are rushing to get their money out of Russia . On Friday , citing the capital flight , Standard & Poor \u2019 s cut Russia \u2019 s credit rating to a notch above junk . Moreover , powerful Russians like Igor Sechin , Rosneft \u2019 s president , like to see themselves as globe-trotting chief executives , and not as Putin cronies .\nYet given Mr. Putin \u2019 s demonstrative disdain for the Geneva agreements , along with the aggressive behavior of Russian troops massed on Ukraine \u2019 s borders and the continued occupation of administrative and security buildings in southeastern Ukrainian cities by Moscow-directed secessionists , such targeted penalties are not likely to change Russia \u2019 s behavior . And the sort that would \u2014 coordinated United States-European Union sanctions on financial institutions , the energy sector or defense industries \u2014 have proved very difficult to construct , largely because of the substantial difference between American and European exposure to Russia \u2019 s economy .\nAbout a quarter of the European Union \u2019 s gas supplies come from Russia , and despite years of talk about reducing this dependence , little has been done . European Union trade with Russia , moreover , amounted to almost $ 370 billion in 2012 , compared with United States-Russia trade of $ 26 billion . This includes some huge sales , like the two helicopter carriers France is building for the Russian Navy as part of a $ 1.6 billion deal signed in 2011 . What that means is that any sanctions that really bite will cost Europe a lot more than the United States .",
