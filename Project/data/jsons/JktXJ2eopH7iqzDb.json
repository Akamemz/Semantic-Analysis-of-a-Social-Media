    "content": "Kyle Spencer , a frequent New York Times contributor , writes often about education . This story was produced by The Hechinger Report , a nonprofit , independent news website focused on inequality and innovation in education .\nJohn White may be the silver-tongued boy wonder of the school reform movement , lauded for his political acumen and often mentioned as a future U.S. secretary of education . But last fall , Louisiana \u2019 s whip-smart and occasionally cantankerous education superintendent found himself on a lonely mission : driving his state-issued Prius along the Bayou State \u2019 s two-lane highways , stopping at churches , schools and Chamber of Commerce meeting halls , promoting the embattled Common Core learning standards to a state whose governor no longer wants them .\nAs rain pounded down outside Scott Middle School in Lafayette , White , in khakis and a navy blazer\u2014a uniform reminiscent of his prep school days\u2014looked like he was gaining ground . Buoyant and self-assured , he told a gaggle of local reporters that the standards were going forward just fine and praised a math lesson he had just witnessed inside .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to tell everyone I meet with that I just saw 25 sixth-graders knock it out of the park on the Common Core standards , \u201d he boomed .\nMeanwhile , back in Baton Rouge , Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal , who once praised the standards as a way to \u201c raise expectations for every child , \u201d was denouncing them and taking potshots at White . That \u2019 s the same White who was appointed by the state board of education in 2012\u2014after much Jindal lobbying\u2014to roll out a roster of education initiatives , among them , yes , the Common Core .\nToday , White , once called \u201c Jindal \u2019 s boy \u201d by political insiders , is the governor \u2019 s most celebrated public enemy , and a statewide education reform initiative years in the making may end up falling by the wayside , adding chaos and confusion to Louisiana \u2019 s already beleaguered school system .\nAll this could easily be chalked up as an only-in-Louisiana tussle to be expected in a state whose education system is near rock bottom and whose political brawls have a tradition of being both colorful and callous . But this battle is bigger than Louisiana . Across the country , the Common Core standards , a set of rigorous K-12 English and math benchmarks designed to improve the state of the nation \u2019 s schools , have become increasingly divisive . Sponsored by the National Governors Association and state education chiefs , they were voluntarily adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia starting in 2010 . But the standards have since become red meat for everyone from Tea Party activists , who cry government overreach , to lefty soccer moms , who rail against their \u201c corporate \u201d approach . The pushback is pitting political allies who came together years ago to support the standards against each other . And it is seriously undermining the power and persuasion of the nation \u2019 s education reformers , who have long seen the standards as the crown jewel of their national efforts to improve American public schools .\nWhether the 39-year-old White can squash the rebellion in his own state is no small matter . It may well indicate whether other progressive reformers\u2014less politically skilled than he\u2014have any shot at salvaging the standards in their own states , and whether Louisiana and other low-performing states really have the stomach for widespread school reform after all .\nThe ailing state of Louisiana \u2019 s public school system was once an unfortunate but accepted reality . Parents who could afford to send their kids to private and parochial schools did . Those who could not suffered through the spotty and unreliable public system , often holding their noses .\nThat all changed in the 1980s , when the state got badly burned by the now infamous oil bust . Oil and gas revenues counted for as much as 41 percent of the state \u2019 s budget in 1981 , and when the industry faltered the state nearly went bankrupt . To reignite the economy , government heavies knew they needed to diversify . But they soon discovered that the state \u2019 s bottom-of-the barrel education ranking was a billboard sign telling corporate America that Louisiana had a dearth of qualified workers . \u201c Fixing the schools \u201d \u2014and fast\u2014became everybody \u2019 s goal .\nIn fits and starts , and with some backward movement , Louisiana began overhauling its community college system , increased teacher pay , rolled out new K-12 testing regimes and eventually took over failing schools , closing some and turning others into charters .\nThe blow from Katrina in 2005 reinforced the improve-schools urgency as dozens of flailing schools in New Orleans were shuttered by the storm and media outlets flocked to the city , shining a discomfiting light on their subpar quality . That helped drive even more legislative support for charter school expansion and a more defined teacher evaluation system , which Jindal helped push through in 2010 .\nA lot of these measures were spurred on by George W. Bush \u2019 s 2002 No Child Left Behind act , which strong-armed states into passing reform bills . But they were also the result of careful bond building between Democratic and Republican lawmakers as well as disparate lobbying groups\u2014from big business to civil rights activists . Traditionally on opposite sides of the aisle and sometimes openly hostile toward each other , they were now in alliance , long-time foes suddenly together in their efforts to better educate Louisiana \u2019 s neediest students , many of them African-Americans .\nLane Grigsby , a Republican and the founder of a well-known construction firm here , says he stood behind these measures because \u201c you \u2019 ve got ta have educated kids for the workforce. \u201d Standing with him were social justice leaders like Kenneth L. Campbell , president of the Black Alliance for Educational Options , who calls education reform an \u201c equity \u201d issue .\nBut despite the across-the-aisle hand-holding and the sheer boldness of many of these measures , they fell short on many counts . From 1990 to 2010 , the state \u2019 s education ranking didn \u2019 t budge much .

Instead , it was an ambitious and unambiguous road map outlining the skills and knowledge every student ought to have at the end of each year .
