    "content": "Hillary Clinton may feel like the press hounds and harasses her , but there \u2019 s one segment of the media from which she \u2019 s getting the kind of coverage you just can \u2019 t buy : women \u2019 s magazines .\nBetter known for features like \u201c 10 ways to flatten your tummy \u201d and lush fashion spreads , the magazines have been hiring well-connected Washington women lately in the hopes that having an inside political track will position them for could be a historic White House run .\nThey \u2019 ve also ramped up their interest in politics , delving into hot-button issues like abortion rights and gay marriage and profiling members of Congress on both sides of the aisle . But a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of several of the magazines \u2019 past few months of coverage suggests that readers will be getting a heavy dose of liberal cheerleading this campaign season along with their skincare , makeup and fashion tips .\n\u201c We \u2019 re thrilled that Hillary is in the race , \u201d said Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief Anne Fulenwider , whose May issue included an entire section on the women who run Washington . \u201c We \u2019 d love to see a woman president for the United States . \u201d\nClinton , a fashionista in her own right who counted herself among famed designer Oscar de la Renta \u2019 s friends , already has a natural home among women \u2019 s magazines and their mostly liberal audiences . But the reporting and writing often veers beyond alignment and into outright boosterism \u2014 if not of Clinton herself , then of Democrats and the progressive causes they identify with .\nTake Vogue . In the past few months , the magazine \u2014 whose fabled editor , Anna Wintour , is an unabashed Clinton fan and has even taken her shopping \u2014 has featured John Kerry , a book about the first lady , and a feature on the first gay male White House social secretary , Jeremy Barnard . Clinton was the first first lady to appear on the magazine \u2019 s cover and has appeared in the magazine at least seven times .\n\u201c I can only hope that all of you here in Little Rock will be celebrating her come November 2016 , \u201d Wintour said as she introduced Clinton at an event in Arkansas in 2013 . \u201c Just as all of us , all of us at Vogue , look forward to putting on the cover the first female president of the United States . \u201d\nElle has seen perhaps the most Clinton action in its pages recently , with a Gucci-clad Chelsea gracing the cover the same week her mother announced her candidacy \u2014 a coincidence , Editor-in-Chief Robbie Myers said \u2014 along with several online articles on everything from how Clinton \u2019 s inner circle is dominated by women to \u201c 12 Times Hillary Clinton showed us exactly who she is \u201d ( \u201c brave , feminist , and unapologetic \u201d ) .\n\u201c I just hope that these editors , which in my experience tend to be very liberal women , can take their blinders off and can see that there are lots of conservative issues women can embrace and lots of conservative women who can be celebrated , \u201d said Katie Packer Gage , a top campaign aide for Mitt Romney \u2019 s failed 2012 presidential bid .\nThe magazines don \u2019 t ignore the GOP . Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina , Reps. Elise Stefanik , Martha McSally , Martha Roby and Jaime Herrera Beutler have all been featured in print or online over the past few months . In previous years , Vogue has written about Laura Bush , Condoleezza Rice , Nikki Haley , Sarah Palin , Rand Paul and other Republicans . And as the cycle gets moving , more GOP women will probably be covered . But you \u2019 re not likely to see articles defending the Supreme Court \u2019 s Hobby Lobby decision , or arguments against federal regulations requiring equal pay for women .\nOf all the top women \u2019 s magazines , Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire cover politics most intensely \u2014 both host stand-alone politics sections on their websites . Cosmopolitan has a full-time politics writer ; last October , Cosmo announced a get-out-the-vote campaign and even began endorsing candidates ( though Editor Joanna Coles said the endorsements would be limited to the midterms ) . Marie Claire has hired former White House deputy chief of staff Alyssa Mastromonaco and former Jill Biden aide Courtney O \u2019 Donnell as contributors , while Glamour hired Giovanna Gray Lockhart , a former aide to Sen. Kristen Gillibrand and wife to former Clinton White House press secretary Joe Lockhart .\nColes , whose recent issue includes a feature on female senators , has been perhaps the most vocal about only backing candidates who are abortion-rights supporters and favor equal pay and mandatory insurance coverage for contraception . But she was actually a bit more subdued about Clinton , saying that while \u201c there \u2019 s a lot of excitement \u201d about the former secretary of state among Cosmo readers , there \u2019 s also some anxiety over her perceived inevitability .\n\u201c It \u2019 s incredibly interesting to us watching the first female presidential candidate with a real shot , \u201d Coles said in an interview . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we think that differently from rest of media on this , but the fact she has been the first women running as president really seriously with a serious shot is very interesting , as a moment of history . \u201d\nClinton deserves some credit for getting more politics into women \u2019 s magazines , Glamour Editor-in-Chief Cindi Leive said .\n\u201c When we first started three cycles ago , we really had to persuade the politicians to be in the magazine \u2014 we had to go through the whole eye-roll , \u2018 Ugh , is this going to be about fashion , are you going to do her do \u2019 s and don \u2019 t \u2019 s ? \u2019 Now , I don \u2019 t get any of that , \u201d Leive said .\nBut Leive , whose magazine featured Michelle Obama on its May cover , pushed back against the idea that women \u2019 s magazines lean left .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s a misconception that fashion or women \u2019 s fashion magazines lean one way , that we \u2019 re Democrats . So part of our coverage that we really adhere to is a fairness and a philosophy of being pro-woman , nonpartisan , \u201d she said , noting that last fall she interviewed Stefanik and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers ( R-Wash. ) . \u201c We have 20 million print and online readers , and these are women whose political views are not monolithic . We keep that top of mind when it comes to our coverage of Washington and politics . \u201d\nThe magazines know they \u2019 re not publishing the most serious political profiles . They tend to focus more on the personal stories behind the candidate , or what it \u2019 s like being a powerful woman , than on their policies or positions on major issues .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to pretend we \u2019 re doing some huge , in-depth political coverage , \u201d Coles said , hastening to add that Cosmo \u2019 s readers still care about serious topics like the economy or foreign policy . \u201c But so much of that is covered in the mainstream media , so where we \u2019 ve been focused is on issues that particularly engage our reader , \u201d she said .\nCovering politicians , especially women politicians , can lead to certain pitfalls , as \u201c Saturday Night Live \u201d comedian Cecily Strong made clear during the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner last month when she demanded that reporters pledge not to report on Clinton \u2019 s appearance .\n\u201c What you never want to do is to go into a situation with a preconceived idea of the outcome , and you never want to go into an interview with a politician with a preconceived sense of what the conversation will be , \u201d Coles said . \u201c We have to be as vigilant as everybody else and at Cosmo we are , actually . \u201d\nFor Myers , the Elle editor-in-chief , focusing on a candidate \u2019 s image is a gender-neutral endeavor .\nHillary Clinton on the cover of magazines during her time as first lady . | AP Photo\n\u201c It \u2019 s so funny to me , but we talk about a man \u2019 s image too , meaning , \u2018 Oh , he \u2019 s scrappy or he \u2019 s a natty dresser , or he clearly has invested in botox \u2019 or whatever , \u201d Myers said .\nShe pointed to a recent Elle story on Clinton . \u201c There was not a lot of undue attention to the way she looked . When you talk about her image , it \u2019 s a much broader word \u2014 how does she come across , communicate to people . \u201d\nThe magazines boast enormous audiences , especially among the younger women whom Clinton \u2019 s camp has always counted on for support \u2014 millions of readers , according to Hearst , which owns Cosmopolitan , Marie Claire and Elle .
