He has always been more comfortable in campaign mode and , slowly but surely , Trump the candidate is winning the struggle . Saturday was one of those days .\n\u201c It \u2019 s called the James S Brady briefing room , not the James S Brady rally room , but today it was hard to tell the difference , \u201d Robert Gibbs , a former White House press secretary , told the MSNBC network .\nI was among an unlucky 13 reporters sitting in that room on Saturday , along with one standing at the back from Trump \u2019 s beloved One America News Network which , having flouted reporters \u2019 agreed physical distancing guidelines , is there at the invitation of the White House .\nLaptops on knees , with several seats between us to maintain physical distancing , we were hardly a typical Make America Great Again crowd . But tellingly , while there was no sign of Dr Anthony Fauci \u2019 s reassuring presence , the seats to Trump \u2019 s right included Mark Meadows , a vocal ally in Congress recently appointed White House chief of staff , and Kayleigh McEnany , the Trump 2020 campaign national spokesperson turned White House press secretary .\nBoth gazed up at their boss reverently and smiled at his jokes . Meanwhile Dr Deborah Birx , response coordinator on the coronavirus taskforce , stood on the podium and spent long periods staring expressionless into the middle distance as Trump reeled off some golden oldies .\n\u201c We had the best economy in the history of the world , better than China , better than any country in the world , better than any country \u2019 s ever had , \u201d he said , waving his hand at what was ostensibly a coronavirus taskforce briefing . \u201c We had the highest stock market in history by far , and I \u2019 m honoured by the fact it \u2019 s started to go up very substantially . \u201d\nWearing a blue suit , white shirt and red tie , Trump added : \u201c We have a big election coming up but I think we have tremendous momentum .
