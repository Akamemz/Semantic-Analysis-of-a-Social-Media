In recent years , his rhetoric on these issues has been in lockstep with # MeToo activists .\nDespite his public pronunciations on the subject of never touching women without their explicit verbal consent , Biden has previously faced accusations that he was too handsy with people . But now the former vice president is facing a much more serious accusation of sexual assault , from an alleged former staffer named Tara Reade .\nIt remains to be seen whether the mainstream media will assign Reade 's story as much credibility and importance as that of Christine Blasey Ford , the woman who accused Kavanaugh ; they certainly have not done so yet . In any case , supporters of Biden\u2014as well as the candidate himself\u2014should take this opportunity to reflect on whether automatic belief is a useful or practical approach for handling decades ' old claims of misconduct .\nReade describes herself as a `` California-based victim rights advocate and activist '' in her interview with the journalist Katie Halper , who has helped bring this accusation to light . Reade says she worked for Biden in the early 1990s and asserts that she was unambiguously assaulted by him in 1993 . According to Reade , he began kissing her without her permission , pushed her against a wall , reached under her skirt , and penetrated her with his fingers .\n`` He said 'come on man , I heard you liked me , ' '' Reade recalled to Halper in the interview . `` For me , it was like , everything shattered . I looked up to him , he was like my father 's age , he was this champion of women 's rights , in my eyes . I could n't believe it was happening . It was surreal .

She said she once tried to talk to a supervisor about what had happened , but this person shut her down before she could tell the whole story .
