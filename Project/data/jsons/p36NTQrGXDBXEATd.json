    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A Trump administration policy of separating immigrant children from adults at the southern border is putting pressure on Republicans and threatening to engulf broader negotiations on Capitol Hill about dealing with those already in the U.S. illegally .\nThe administration \u2019 s \u201c zero-tolerance policy \u201d of detaining adults attempting to cross into the U.S. has resulted in the division of families traveling with children , and the federal government is beginning to run out of space for its detainees .\nRep. Will Hurd of Texas , a Republican whose district spans 800 miles of the Mexico border and who is locked in a competitive race for his seat , toured a temporary tent facility on the southern border the administration constructed to house the swelling number of separated children . He used the tour to distance himself from the administration \u2019 s policy .\n\u201c This really isn \u2019 t a Republican or Democratic issue , \u201d Mr. Hurd told CNN following the tour . \u201c This is an issue about how should you treat children . \u201d\nMeanwhile , divided Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to show results on the issue of illegal immigration ahead of midterm elections in which centrists and conservatives are facing competing demands from voters .\nPresident Donald Trump will attend a meeting of the House Republican conference Tuesday night , and immigration is likely to be one of the topics on the agenda , said Marc Short , the president \u2019 s legislative affairs chief , in an interview Sunday . \u201c The policy is incredibly complicated and it is one we need to do a better job of communicating , \u201d Mr. Short said , of the issue of separating families . \u201c We \u2019 ve not talked about the history of how we got to this point . \u201d\nThe GOP-controlled House of Representatives may vote on two Republican-crafted immigration measures this week , said the office of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R. , Calif. ) .\nOne bill is assembled by negotiators from the GOP \u2019 s moderate and conservative wings ; another is more conservative . Both aim to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children , as well as seeking to increase border security .\nEach would also broadly allow children arriving at the southern border to be detained with their parents in the same facility , or for the release of a child to a relative .\nThe White House has said that Mr. Trump would sign either bill if it passed .\nIn the Senate , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky. ) was bruised by the collapse of an immigration bid earlier this year and has been skeptical that the Senate would take it up again while Republicans remain in possession of a slim 51-vote majority . He has said only that if the House passes something , and the president supports it , he would be willing to reconsider .\nA decades-old court settlement bars the U.S. government from jailing migrant children . Until recently , the result was that families who crossed the border seeking asylum were often released into the U.S. while their cases are pursued .\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it had separated 1,995 immigrant children from 1,940 adults , whom it described as \u201c alleged adult parents , \u201d at the border between mid-April and the end of May .\nThe administration hasn \u2019 t said what percentage of adult immigrants have been prosecuted , though Homeland Security has said it has implemented a zero-tolerance policy for all adults and is referring every such immigrant for prosecution . DHS and the Justice Department haven \u2019 t said how officials decide which cases to prosecute and which families to separate .\nIn May , more than 9,400 people traveling as families were arrested at the Mexican border , along with about 6,400 children who were traveling alone . Since the start of the budget year in October , more than 32,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol along the Mexican border . That is a 4 % increase over the same period in 2017 . Separately , more than 59,000 people traveling as families have been arrested at the border during that same period , a slight decrease over 2017 .\nMr. Short said Republicans needed to do more to emphasize their arguments that immigration rules had created an incentive for adults to seek to make dangerous border crossings with children in tow , and that establishing more beds to house children and adults together would untie border security officials \u2019 hands .\nDemocratic lawmakers spent the weekend visiting detention facilities at the southern border and elsewhere , including a group of New York and New Jersey Democrats that toured a center in Elizabeth , N.J. , to make their case .\n\u201c Republicans control every branch of government , \u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell ( D. , N.J. ) . \u201c They are making these disgraces happen every day . \u201d\nThe administration is facing increasing pressure on existing facilities , even without the possibility of new facilities to detain families together .
