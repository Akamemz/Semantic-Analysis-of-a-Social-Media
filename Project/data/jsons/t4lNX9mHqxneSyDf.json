    "content": "I stirred up some controversy last week , when I told a conference of several dozen House Republicans that the GOP is now officially a Trump working class party . For better or worse , I said at the gathering inside the Capitol Dome the baton has now officially been passed from the Reagan era to the new Trump era . The members didn \u2019 t quite faint over my apostasy , but the shock was palpable .\nI emphasized that Republicans must prioritize delivering jobs and economic development to the regions of the country like the industrial Midwest \u2014 states like Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , Wisconsin , Iowa , and Missouri . These are places that , for the most part , never felt the meager Obama recovery and where blue-collar Reagan Democrats took a leap of faith and came back to the Republican Party for the first time since 1984 . The GOP will be judged in 2018 and 2020 as to whether it delivers results for this part of the country and for the forgotten middle-class men and women ( \u201c the deplorables \u201d ) who Democrats abandoned economically and culturally . This is all simply a political truism .\nWhat caught the ire of some of my conservative friends was my statement that \u201c just as Reagan converted the GOP into a conservative party , with his victory this year , Trump has converted the GOP into a populist America First party . \u201d\nOne friend lamented that I must have been drunk when I said this .\nNo . I meant exactly what I said , but I will clarify .\nFirst , let me lay to rest the idea that this was a backhanded slam against Reagan \u2019 s legacy . Hardly . I worked for the Gipper . He rebuilt the American economy and caused a quarter century-long boom in wealth creation and prosperity nearly unrivaled in American history . He won the Cold War and vanquished the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union . He belongs on Mount Rushmore .\nBut this is 2016 , not 1986 . The world is a different place . The concerns and priorities of the American people are different today than 30 years ago . The voters spoke with a thunder clap . Trump squashed his 16 GOP rivals \u2014 a field touted as the most talented field of wannabes in modern history \u2014 as if they were bugs crashing into his windshield . GOP voters opted for his new breed of economic populism . Republicans who were Never Trumpers and who insisted with absolute certainly that Trump could never win the primary let alone the general election can pretend that a political sonic boom didn \u2019 t happen .\nGuess what ? It did . A realignment occurred while all the high falutin \u2019 intellectuals and political consultants were napping .\nSo yes , this means we have awoken to a new party that will be a lot tougher on illegal immigration . A lot more skeptical of lopsided trade deals . A lot more wary of foreign entanglements . More prone to spend money on infrastructure . \u200eI don \u2019 t approve of all of these shifts , but they are what the voters voted for . Trump was hardly ambiguous about what he intended to do . Trade and immigration are unambiguously good for the country \u2014 but it will have to be done in ways that are supported by the American people , not shoved down our throats by the elites . In this way , I am more of a populist . The elites in both parties have never understood Trumpism and often are contemptuous of the intellect and lifestyles of the Trump loyalists .\nConservatives should go back and read Jude Wanniski \u2019 s classic The Way the World Works .
