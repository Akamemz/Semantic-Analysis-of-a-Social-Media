    "content": "The U.S. assassination of Qassem Suleimani , the mastermind of Tehran \u2019 s foreign military operations , in Baghdad last week , suddenly made Iraq the front line in tensions between the United States and Iran . Barham Salih , a British-educated Kurd who spent years representing his party in Washington , was elected President of Iraq in 2018 . Salih has been increasingly concerned about Iraq \u2019 s vulnerability since the Trump Administration blamed Iran for an air strike that damaged more than a dozen strategic oil installations in Saudi Arabia , in September . I \u2019 ve known Salih for more than a quarter century , including when he was in Washington and later when he became the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq . We began a conversation in September , at the U.N. General Assembly , about the danger that Iraq will become a war zone\u2014again\u2014only this time between the United States and Iran . I checked in with him again on Sunday to update our conversation .\nIraq has struggled to balance ties with both Washington and Tehran since the U.S. invasion , in 2003 . \u201c The United States is our ally . Iran is our neighbor , \u201d Salih told me . The U.S. attack on Suleimani\u2014which was carried out without informing the government in Baghdad\u2014challenged Iraqi sovereignty and triggered unprecedented political fury at the United States within the country . On Sunday , the parliament of Iraq voted to require the government to \u201c end any foreign presence on Iraqi soil and prevent the use of Iraqi airspace , soil and water for any reason \u201d by foreign troops . The United States has more than five thousand troops in Iraq ; it leads a multinational coalition that is still fighting ISIS and training the Iraqi military . The vote in the parliament , which has three hundred and twenty-eight seats , was 170\u20130 . It was carried largely by Shiite lawmakers ; many Sunnis and Kurds did not vote . The measure will not go into force until signed by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi , but Mahdi drafted its language . And , in any case , he has been only a caretaker of the government since he resigned , in November , after weeks of protests .\nOver the weekend , Iran vowed major retaliation for Suleimani \u2019 s death , which led the United States to suspend diplomatic and military operations in Iraq . On Sunday , the U.S.-led coalition announced that it was at least temporarily halting operations against ISIS . The U.S. Embassy also suspended consular operations . The State Department urged all Americans to leave Iraq . The interview with Salih about current dangers has been edited for length and clarity .\nHow worried are you about a conflict\u2014openly or covertly\u2014between Iran and the United States after the death of Qassem Suleimani ?\nThe dynamics are dangerous\u2014and I have to be deeply concerned that Iraq will be embroiled in yet another cycle of conflict . Iraq and its hard-won stability in the aftermath of the war on ISIS could unravel . This would have terrible consequences for Iraq and the region at large . We must do all that is possible to assert restraint and walk back from the brink . When we spoke in September , our focus was economic regeneration , job creation , and governance reforms . Then , in October , protests swept the country demanding reforms , justice , and affirming the sovereignty of Iraq . Now we are talking about the challenge of averting war and conflict . In this context , and out of these dangerous dynamics , Iraq \u2019 s sovereignty and stability should become the common interest upon which the regional and international actors agree on a way forward .\nWhat lessons did Iraq learn from its own eight-year war with Iran ?\nWar is devastating . There is absolutely no winner in a war . The human cost has been monumental for Iraq . Certainly , for Iran , too . But , also , the lesson is never start a war because you never know how it ends . And one other important lesson : Iraq should never serve as a gate for others . And Iraq should not fight a war , paid for by Iraqi resources and Iraqi lives , for others .\nWhat specific lessons did you learn about fighting Iran particularly ? If you were looking back on it now , thinking about the current crisis in the Gulf , what were the lessons ?\nThe last thing the Middle East needs is a terrible war , especially as the last war , against ISIS , is yet to be definitively over . Starting a war may be the easiest of decisions , but the region can not afford , can not tolerate , another conflict . Too much is at stake .\nYou know that eight-year conflict intimately , and you know what fighting Iran is like . They don \u2019 t give up easily .\nThe Middle East has gone through cycles of violence , has literally not known peace and security for a very , very long time . The onset of the Iraq-Iran War was the end of the regional order in the Middle East . For the last forty years , Iraq has been a main domain of conflicts across the Middle East . Everyone had a proxy to fight this war on Iraqi soil , essentially using Iraqi resources and Iraqi lives . I do not want to see my country embroiled in yet another conflict , and I do not want to see another war undermining the hard-won stability that Iraq has achieved . The success in Iraq is real but very fragile . I fear that it can not survive another conflict in the Middle East .\nBarham Salih , the President of Iraq , addressing the United Nations General Assembly , in New York City , in September , 2019 . Photograph by Drew Angerer / Getty\nIraq will be very badly affected by yet another conflict , which could well undermine the hard-won stability that we have achieved after years of conflict , and certainly after the last war , against ISIS . If we are not careful , we may go beyond the brink , God help us all , in the neighborhood and internationally , as well .\nYou have a senseless conflict in Yemen , with untold humanitarian suffering . You have an unfinished war and conflict in Syria . You have a stable order in Iraq that is still fragile . And you have the security of the Gulf very much in question . You have remnants of ISIS that must not be underestimated . You have the greatest issue of ISIS families and detainees , and you \u2019 re talking about the monumental legal , moral , security problems . And you have Idlib [ a province in Syria ] , with Nusra and Hurras ad-Deen and many other extremist groups .\nThe military defeat against ISIS was a significant success , no doubt . But terrorism is yet to be defeated definitively , is yet to be eradicated . There are many terrorist and extremist groups spawning across the Middle East . And , again , the last war is yet to be finished , and we \u2019 re talking about starting a new war ? It \u2019 s just madness . We need to be careful . Cool heads to prevail . Restraint . Go back to the negotiating table and get this talked out .\nWe are now focussing on launching a reconstruction fund for infrastructure and to attract foreign direct investment to Iraq . In a situation of conflict , I can not imagine foreign investment coming to the Middle East .\nWe have legions of unemployed youth across the neighborhood , and we need to expand our economies , create job opportunities for our youth . If this is true in the United States , when your leaders talk about jobs , jobs , jobs , it \u2019 s definitely far truer across the Middle East\u2014legions of unemployed youth who can fall prey to extremism and destabilize not only our societies but global security . This has to be the challenge .\nLet me posit you the following context . I think the Middle East is probably the last remaining major region in the world that is broken . In the early part of the twentieth century , Europe was totally broken . Two world wars . They fixed it . In the sixties and seventies , East Asia was the main conflict area of the world . It was essentially fixed . And you go to Vietnam , you go to Korea , you go to wherever . In the nineteen-eighties , it was Latin America and Central America . It was somewhat fixed . In the nineteen-nineties , the former Soviet Union and South Africa . Yet the Middle East , throughout the twentieth century and now into the twenty-first century , remains the main source of instability across the world .\nThis region needs to be fixed , and the way to fix it has to come , the solution has to come , from the neighborhood . And I can not see another alternative but economic integration and creating interdependencies , really moving beyond these senseless dynamics of conflict . We go back to what you started with : the Iraq-Iran War . What have we achieved out of the Iraq-Iran War ? Did this gain us any security ? Did this bring us any stability ? No . A lot of people were killed . A lot of people were maimed . A lot of resources were wasted and squandered . And the conflict can not be resolved by war . Really . The lesson of that , and , for that matter , even of 2003 , is just basically that war should be the very , very last option . That war , at least in the context of our part of the world , has never been proven to be a solution .\nYou keep going back to the Iran-Iraq War . What did you learn about the Iranians , though ?\nI mean , I can tell you that Iran is a major geopolitical actor . Iran is a culture of thousands of years of civilization . If I go back , I would say the following : one can say the Iraq-Iran War marked the collapse of the regional order .\nIraq is at the heart of this region . Iraq \u2019 s stability , in my view , is a common interest of its neighbors . They should not be able to afford another destabilization of Iraq . They should not be able to afford another terrorist wave sweeping across the region . Instead , we should be focussed on what is vitally important to our societies : creating job opportunities for our children , reforming our education system , and moving on . And , again , to take things in context , this is the last remaining major region that is broken . The region can not afford it .\nWhat might a war look like now ? Would it be different from the war between Iran and Iraq forty years ago ?\nI think it would be very different . The scale will be different . The regional implications would be different . Iran is my neighbor . We have fourteen hundred kilometres of borders with Iran . We can \u2019 t ignore Iran . I want to remind you that the security of Iraq is vital for the security of the neighborhood . People should not think that they can have another conflict , essentially undermining Iraq \u2019 s stability , and think that they can be immune from it . If you don \u2019 t respect Iraq \u2019 s stability and preserve it and protect it , this regional order will not come about .\nLook at the geopolitics of Iraq . This is where , every time , Arabia , for millennia\u2014Persia , Anatolia\u2014collided . From Alexander the Great , this is where the regional order is defined , when the British came in the twentieth century , when the Americans came in the twenty-first century . Iraq-Mesopotamia is important geopolitically . We need to preserve this stability in order to create any regional order . But war is not the way . Saddam Hussein tried it and failed miserably . And we paid dearly for it in Iraq . The neighborhood has paid dearly for it . The Iranians have paid dearly for it .\nIraq \u2019 s interests , national interests , is to have very good neighborly relations with Iran . Never again a war with Iran . We do not want to be in a state of conflict with our neighbor , with any of our neighbors .\nWhat if Iran was responsible for the attack on Saudi Arabia in September ? What does that tell us about Iran \u2019 s intentions ?\nThe Iranians have been very clear to all . If you prevent me from selling my oil and acquiring the revenues needed , I \u2019 m not going to let others do it . Sanctions are a dubious tool , to say the least . I \u2019 m worried about their consequences for the people of Iran , as a neighbor . They \u2019 re my neighbors ; I have to be concerned for their well-being .\nAt the end of the day , we need all the key players to sit at a damn table and really discuss it . . . . Aggression and attacks are not things that I would condone . Military action , from wherever it comes\u2014I would not condone it . Again , we have seen too many conflicts and we have seen too many military interventions that meant nothing but destruction to our neighborhood .\nSome Americans want to equate it , as if , when Iran says something , Iraq will say , \u201c Yes , sir. \u201d It \u2019 s not . Wallah , it \u2019 s not . It \u2019 s a bit more complicated . And the Americans should learn from their own history in Iraq , when they were telling the Iraqis to do this and that . Did they do it ? No . Is that a fair point ? Is that a fair point ? People have their minds , and there are realities you can look at .\nThe best line is that the United States is our ally . Iran is our neighbor .",
