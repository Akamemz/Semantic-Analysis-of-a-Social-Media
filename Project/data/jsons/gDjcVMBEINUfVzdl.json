''\nTrump 's defenders counter that he has faced tough problems and unrelenting opposition from his political foes . `` It 's not a good climate out there , and he 's navigating through it , '' John Sakach , 80 , the owner of a construction-supply business in suburban Chicago , said in a follow-up interview .\nFor the first time during Trump 's presidency , a majority of Americans , 53 % , say in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll that the economy is in a recovery . That typically would lift views that the nation is headed in the right direction . But this time , nearly two-thirds , or 64 % , also say the country is on the wrong track , up 21 percentage points since the beginning of the year and the highest of his tenure .\nAs Trump approaches the one-year anniversary of his election next month , his underwater approval ratings and the public 's anxiety hold perils for his presidency . They embolden his critics and make it harder for him to push legislative proposals such as a tax bill through Congress .\nHistorically , sagging presidential approval ratings also signal trouble for the party in power in midterm elections .\nThose surveyed say , by 57 % -33 % , that they want to elect a Congress in 2018 that mostly stands up to Trump , not one that mostly cooperates with him . And that includes almost one in five Republicans , as well as the predictable partisan divide , with nine of 10 Democrats calling for an opposition Congress .

By an even wider margin , 69 % -15 % , they say the U.S. should launch military strikes only in response to a North Korea attack , not as a pre-emptive step .\n`` There 's a place for military , absolutely , but when dealing with nuclear weapons , you have to try diplomacy first , '' says Annie Davis , 41 , of Greenville , S.C. , the manager of a veterinary clinic who was among those polled . `` There are civilians on both sides . ''\nOn Saturday , in Beijing , Tillerson said the United States had `` made it clear that we hope to resolve this through talks , '' saying his immediate goal was `` to calm things down '' with North Korea .\nThat brought an extraordinary public rebuke from Trump . `` I told Rex Tillerson , our wonderful secretary of State , that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man , '' Trump tweeted on Sunday , a reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . `` Save your energy Rex , we 'll do what has to be done ! ''\nThose surveyed disapprove of the president 's handling of North Korea by 56 % -34 % .\nThat said , both Trump supporters and critics agree that the president inherited a complicated and dangerous standoff with Pyongyang , with no easy path ahead . `` This guy , Kim , is a very unstable man and has no respect for the nuclear issue , which goes all the way back to when Bill Clinton was in office , '' says Doug Johnson , 54 , of Hannibal , Mo . `` If you could take care of that with diplomacy , I would be 100 % for that , but I do n't think that 's the case here .
