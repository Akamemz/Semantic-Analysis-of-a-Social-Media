Tougher sanctions would only isolate Washington , not pressure Tehran .\nSome are insisting on a \u201c better deal \u201d than the framework nuclear agreement reached with Iran on April 2 . But the idea of a better deal is a chimera , an illusory option , and it should not lull us into thinking there is another agreement to be had if only we were to bear down harder .

This is a constructive step , avoiding an action that would undercut negotiations toward a final agreement . But we need to keep the sanctions issue in mind because it is inextricably intertwined with the same calls for a better deal emanating from people in Congress , Israel , and other critics . No one can argue that a better agreement wouldn \u2019 t be better\u20143,000 Iranian centrifuges is better than 5,000 ; a 20-year deal is better than 10 . The tough question is : How do you get there ? Putting aside what the Iranians might do in response to additional pressure\u2014dig in deeper , speed up their program\u2013and looking just at our side of the equation , the notion of a better deal is unachievable .\nHere is why . According to critics , seeking a better deal starts with increasing sanctions on Iran . If tough sanctions brought them to the table , tougher sanctions will bring them to their knees . At some point their economy will be in tatters from the intensified sanctions , and they will be forced to return to the bargaining table and agree to better deal . With a closer look , however , this scenario unravels .\nFirst , it is highly unlikely that even our allies in Europe would join us in further sanctions against Iran in the wake of a nuclear agreement they believe is sensible and positive . That is even truer for other countries\u2014like India , Japan , South Korea and China\u2014that were pulled into the existing sanctions regime quite unwillingly . The support of these countries for the oil sanctions in particular has been critical to the sanctions \u2019 effectiveness . They will not willingly sign up for more .\nSecond , if a deal falls through , it is likely that the existing multilateral sanctions regime will begin to crumble . As noted , countries like India and South Korea , who don \u2019 t feel threatened by an Iran nuclear weapon , will be only too happy to find a pretext to break out of the sanctions\u2014perhaps tentatively at first but in a rush as others do . It will be hard to argue the rationale for sanctions , which , from the perspective of nearly every nation , will have achieved their purpose\u2014bringing Iran to the table to negotiate serious limitations on its nuclear program .\nIndeed , the proponents of tougher sanctions to get a \u201c better \u201d deal have misunderstood the nature of the Iranian sanctions . The fact is that the United States does not own or control the multilateral sanctions regime . The effectiveness of the sanctions is based on how the international community views the perceived threat and therefore the legitimacy of coercive actions to stop it .\nThird , those who seek a better deal through tougher sanctions argue that we don \u2019 t necessarily need international support . The United States could unilaterally enact sanctions that have extraterritorial reach , as we already have done with a number of Congressional measures since 2010 . The proposition is that we will to some degree deny foreign companies access to the larger , more important American market , if they choose to do business with Iran .\nHowever , the context has entirely changed since the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Act was passed in 2010 . New extraterritorial sanctions would be directed against an Iran that has reached an agreement on its nuclear program with major world powers . The rest of the world generally detests our assertion of authority involving foreign companies in foreign countries . Here , for example , we would seek to close the U.S. market to Germany \u2019 s BMW if they sold cars to Iran or Japan \u2019 s Sony if it sold in Iran . If Congress imposed sanctions in spite of a nuclear agreement reached with Iran by major powers , the international community\u2014except for a few countries\u2014would believe those sanctions to be illegitimate . In this context , it is hard to imagine the U.S. government moving ahead with major sanctions proceedings against many of our friends and allies .\nSo , as we discuss and debate the merits of this framework agreement , and a final agreement that may follow , let \u2019 s recognize that this is the agreement we will have\u2014not some imagined alternative . In my judgment , if the next stage of negotiations succeeds , the framework that emerged this week lays the groundwork for a strong and effective agreement .\nThe framework does not\u2014nor by itself is it likely to\u2014fundamentally alter the other threats Iran poses in the region , including its ongoing efforts to exert control in Damascus , Beirut , Baghdad and Sanaa , and its continuing threat to Israel . That is why it is important to embed this agreement in a regional strategy that bolsters concrete cooperation with our friends in the region and reassures them that we are there for the long haul . President Obama \u2019 s summit with regional partners at Camp David will be an important opportunity to look not only at the hot spots , but at the bigger picture .\nThe Iran nuclear agreement is important not despite other troubles in the region but because of them . Each challenge would be more difficult and dangerous if Iran \u2019 s nuclear program was unconstrained and unmonitored , let alone if Iran were to develop a nuclear weapon and spark others in the region to follow . Under the agreement that is emerging , we will have a high degree of confidence\u2014as will others in the region\u2014that Iran \u2019 s nuclear program is seriously constrained .
