Biden to get his campaign back on track in Thursday \u2019 s debate , the pressure on the vice president couldn \u2019 t be greater .\nVice presidential match-ups usually don \u2019 t have the power to change the course of the election , but this year could be different . Mr. Biden is acutely aware that Mr. Obama \u2019 s dismal performance in his first faceoff with Republican rival Mitt Romney largely erased Mr. Obama \u2019 s lead in several key battleground states , ratcheting up the stakes for his performance Thursday night at Centre College in Danville , Ky .\nAs Mr. Obama \u2019 s No . 2 , Mr. Biden doesn \u2019 t have the burden of looking presidential , so can bare some teeth and punch hard against Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , Mr. Romney \u2019 s running mate . But getting too loose and looking angry against Mr. Ryan , a budget expert 27 years his junior , could easily backfire on the vice president , leading him to veer off script and reminding viewers of Sen. John McCain \u2019 s grumpy 2008 debate performance against Mr. Obama , who remained calm and collected .\nWith this in mind , Mr. Biden has been assiduously preparing for his prime-time clash with Mr. Ryan . Holed up for much of the week in a hotel in Wilmington , Del. , the vice president has been scrutinizing videos of Mr. Ryan \u2019 s speeches and interviews , and holding mock debates against Rep. Chris Van Hollen , Maryland Democrat , who is playing Mr. Ryan in debate preparation , as well as David Axelrod , a senior adviser in the Obama campaign .\nMr. Biden \u2019 s frequent gaffes on the campaign trail have given Republicans plenty of campaign fodder , but the vice president seemed keenly focused on trying to keep his tongue in check Thursday .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to say anything in the debate that \u2019 s not completely accurate , \u201d he told reporters late last week .\nThough Mr. Biden has created a few headaches for Mr. Obama throughout the election , Mr. Biden is a seasoned debate veteran who has run for president twice and delivered a strong performance against then-Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin in 2008 .\nRelatively untested , Mr. Ryan is more of a blank slate . His aides say he has participated in a debate only once \u2014 when he first ran for Congress 14 years ago . Mr. Ryan also has been hunkered down in debate preparation over the past week , spending days at a resort in the Blue Ridge Mountains 150 miles southwest of Washington , where he was joined by former Solicitor General Ted Olson , who played the role of Mr. Biden in mock debates .\nFour years ago , Mr. Biden approached the debate against Mrs. Palin cautiously , careful not to get too rough with the newcomer to the national stage . But after Mr. Obama \u2019 s lethargic showing last week , Mr. Biden is expected to come out swinging .\n\u201c I expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball , \u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters earlier this week . \u201c He \u2019 ll be in full attack mode , and I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 ll let any inconvenient facts get in his way . \u201d\nIf what Mr. Biden has been saying on the campaign trail is any indication , he will likely try to force Mr. Ryan to defend Mr. Romney \u2019 s proposals on taxes and spending \u2014 and seize any opportunity to tie Mr. Romney to Mr. Ryan \u2019 s Medicare plan , which includes caps on future spending and a plan to partially privatize it .\nJust last week , Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan sparred over the Democrats \u2019 desire to let the Bush-era tax rates for households making $ 250,000 and up expire at the end of the year . Even though the call for a tax hike on top earners wasn \u2019 t new , Mr. Biden \u2019 s blunt language admitting that he and Mr. Obama want a $ 1 trillion tax increase gave Mr. Ryan an opportunity to go on the attack .\nCampaigning in Council Bluffs , Iowa , Mr. Biden said Mr. Romney and other Republicans often say , \u201c \u2018 Obama and Biden want to raise taxes by a trillion dollars. \u2019 Guess what ? Yes , we do , in one regard : We want to let that trillion-dollar tax cut expire so the middle class doesn \u2019 t have to bear the burden of all that money going to the super-wealthy .
