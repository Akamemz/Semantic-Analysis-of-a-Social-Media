It loomed from videos over the stage . It stared out from T-shirts outside the arena , pointing a finger and saying stuff like , \u201c Hillary , You \u2019 re Fired ! \u201d Three of the four convention nights Mr. Trump himself appeared on stage .\nThis week in Philadelphia , the Democrats are using a much different , more traditional approach . The party \u2019 s biggest names have marched to the podium one by one and praised Mrs. Clinton while bashing Trump . Except for a brief hug with President Obama on Wednesday night , Clinton herself has stayed more behind the scenes .\nThat will change somewhat with her acceptance speech Thursday . But this contrast in stagecraft is a symbol of the essential differences between the Trump and Clinton campaigns .\nTrump is \u2013 in Newt Gingrich \u2019 s word \u2013 a \u201c pirate , \u201d a master of reaching out across global media platforms to grab the world \u2019 s attention with a sudden , bold stroke . Sometimes the move misses \u2013 witness yesterday \u2019 s uproar about whether he should have urged Russia to hack and release missing Clinton emails . But the action and resulting attention is the thing .\nClinton is more of a communitarian , heir and presumptive next leader of an existing political coalition . She \u2019 s guarded by nature . Her campaign seems a coordinated , almost corporate effort of many people doing many things , some visible ( surrogate speeches ) and some not ( microtargeted emails ) .\nThe result is a fascinating clash of new versus old approaches to media , organized versus insurgent marketing , and two personalities as different as July and December . It \u2019 s a race that scholars and political pros will be studying for years .\n\u201c Trump is consciously running an unrestrained and uncontrolled campaign , while it is true that Clinton \u2019 s methodology creates distance between herself and voters , \u201d says Jeffrey Engel , director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .\nClinton \u2019 s approach is an attempt to \u201c dramatically cut down on mistakes , \u201d Engel adds . \u201c It \u2019 s a prevent defense . \u201d\nIn part this split is rooted in traditional differences between the parties . It \u2019 s a political truism that the Republican Party is more organized around ideology , while the Democratic Party is more transactional . The former involves what George H. W. Bush called \u201c the vision thing \u201d and punchy presentations . The latter means making Democratic interest groups happy with targeted policies .\nThus Trump \u2019 s campaign website is thin on policy details and long on assertions that it is only the GOP nominee who can Make America Great Again . Clinton \u2019 s corresponding site is so numbingly detailed that it has a section on curtailing \u201c horse soring , \u201d the use of chemicals to exaggerate gait , as New York Times columnist David Brooks pointed out this week .\nThe differences are also personal . Trump has been a celebrity for years and is as comfortable making media appearances as he is taking a nap . He obviously believes that there is no such thing as bad news coverage . There are only chances for attention ( and possible votes ) missed .\nIn contrast , Clinton herself seems almost physically absent from the campaign . Trump has correctly pointed out that it has been more than 235 days since the Democratic nominee last held a press conference . She sits for personal interviews , but not at Trump \u2019 s pace .
