''\nEarlier in the afternoon , Cruz had urged state Republicans here at the Broadmoor Arena to help him defeat Trump .\n`` If we continue to stand united , we are going to win this Republican nomination . We are going to win the general election . We are going to win the state of Colorado and we are going to turn this country around , '' Cruz said to huge cheers from the arena floor .\nJUST WATCHED Cruz , Trump make mad dash for delegates Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz , Trump make mad dash for delegates 03:57\nIn yet another sign of his airtight ground game , Cruz spoke before a huge screen displaying his slate of delegates for the final 13 spots , and he noted that his slate was also printed on the bright orange T-shirts that his many volunteers were wearing on the state convention floor .\nTrump 's campaign , by contrast , initially distributed fliers listing the campaign 's national delegate candidates that were riddled with errors . The flier displaying the Trump slate is supposed to be the tip sheet that party members use to fill out their ballot . But on the first slate that the Trump campaign was giving out , more than a half dozen of their delegate candidates were listed with the wrong delegate number . At least one of the delegate numbers corresponded to a delegate supporting Cruz .\nThe Trump campaign reprinted the flier , but the second flier also included several errors .\nBefore the voting began , Trump campaign adviser Patrick Davis said in an interview that the team had been given `` incomplete '' information by the Colorado Republican Party about delegate numbers .\nLater in the evening , as the votes were being counted , senior Trump adviser Alan Cobb said several supporters had told the campaign that their ballot number had changed numerous times or that their name did not appear on the party 's official list of national delegate candidates even though they had filled out the proper paperwork .\nAlan Cobb , the senior adviser to Trump , said the campaign was looking into the reports of balloting problems and was not ruling out a challenge to seating the Colorado delegation at the national convention in July .\nA spokesman for the state party said it was looking into the reports but had no immediate comment .\nIt was unclear how much confusion that caused , but the Trump campaign has acknowledged that it did not expect to win any delegates in Colorado .\nWhile there was fervent enthusiasm for Cruz , former New Hampshire Sen. John E. Sununu , who was Ohio Gov . John Kasich 's surrogate at the gathering , was greeted with polite applause .\n`` We 've got to unify behind that candidate who will win , '' Sununu told the crowd , pointing to Kasich 's strength in general election polling matchups with Hillary Clinton . Kasich , however , had not won any delegates as of Saturday afternoon .\nTrump campaign surrogate Stephen Miller , a policy adviser to the real estate magnate , drew a warmer response by opening his speech with a focus on the issue that helped carry Trump to the top of the Republican field : Immigration .\n`` Do you think the United States of America needs to secure its border ? '' Miller asked the crowd , which shouted `` Yes '' in response . Before even mentioning Trump 's candidacy , Miller went on to read letters from parents who he said had lost their children to `` illegal immigrant violence . ''\n`` These Americans deserve a voice and I am going to give it to them today , '' Miller said . `` It 's the powerless who are standing up behind Mr . Trump . ''\nCruz dominated the intricate delegate selection process of the Colorado Republican Party , and in this pivotal swing state , a strong campaign organization has often made the difference between defeat and victory in the race to the White House .\nIn this first round for the GOP , Team Cruz once again proved its mettle -- far outpacing the efforts of Trump and Kasich in the scramble for delegates at each of the congressional district gatherings this week .\nBy late Friday , Cruz had swept all the available delegates in the state 's seven congressional districts .\nIn the final rounds of a messy and chaotic process Friday , candidates vying to be one of Colorado 's delegates lined up along the walls of the ballroom at a Doubletree hotel here waiting their turn to deliver campaign speeches . `` You have 10 seconds . Go ! '' a party official barked as the first candidate stepped to the microphone Friday morning .\nCruz volunteers seemed to be everywhere , working the hallways where party members were crammed shoulder to shoulder among vendors peddling Cruz infinity scarves and Trump-style `` Make America Great Again '' hats . In one corner , a hot pink handwritten sign lured the undecided over to talk to `` Cruz Persuasion Teams . ''\nThe ballroom floor was littered Cruz campaign slates ( the tip sheets indicating which delegates are endorsed by the campaign ) . Scattered across the room were glossy copies of the `` Donald Trump Voter Guide , '' which is actually an anti-Trump pamphlet distributed by one of the super PACs that is trying to defeat him .\nAmid all the jostling , shouting and chaos throughout the day Friday , delegates aligned with Cruz won again and again .\nTrump still maintains a wide lead over Cruz in the delegate count as the two candidates attempt to win the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the Republican nomination .\nBut at a time when a contested convention looks increasingly likely , there was palpable disdain for Trump 's candidacy among the GOP faithful here . His string of unforced errors , nasty tweets and controversial policy statements in recent weeks have clearly taken a toll .\n`` The momentum against Trump at the activist level is just frothing , '' said Josh Penry , a former state senator who was Marco Rubio 's state chairman in Colorado . `` There was a time when Trump could have competed in Colorado . That time has long since passed . ... Among the activists , the tide has turned against him dramatically . ''\nTrump canceled a planned rally in Colorado this week as he focused his efforts on New York , which holds its critical primary on April 19 .\nWhile Trump had some fervent supporters here at the state convention , it was clear from the speeches delivered by delegate candidates that his appeal has worn thin for many Republicans -- a testament to how much work the real estate magnate would have to do to unite the party if he becomes the nominee .\nAt Thursday night 's gathering for Colorado 's 7th Congressional District , 19-year-old student Angel Merlos urged the crowd to elect him as a Cruz delegate to the convention , because he said the nation 's values and morals were at stake if Trump were to become the Republican nominee .\n`` Morality is about how you act , how you speak , and how you carry yourself , '' Merlos said in interview after his brief speech in Arvada . `` I believe Trump has no morals because he lies about many things . ... He contradicts himself on everything . ''\n`` He thinks he knows what will help the immigration problem , but he does n't , '' Merlos continued . `` He talks about a wall -- that may do something . I do n't know exactly what it will do . But he uses immigrants to help him build his buildings , and yet he 's so cruel and harsh '' when he talks about them , Merlos said .\nDelegate candidate David Head ran as an `` unpledged '' delegate in the hope of serving as a voice against Trump on the floor of Republican convention in July .\n`` I think he would be a disaster for both the Republican Party and the country , '' said Head , who owns an insurance business in Westminster , Colorado , with his son .\nJUST WATCHED This is how to win delegates at a convention Replay More Videos ...
