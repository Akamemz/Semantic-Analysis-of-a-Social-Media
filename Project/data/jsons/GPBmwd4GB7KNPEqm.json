But in those states , we recognize that ... the federal government does n't have the resources to police whether somebody is smoking a joint on a corner .

''\nShortly after the interview was published , the administration rushed to clarify the President 's position . It said the White House opposes a national move to decriminalize pot despite Obama 's personal views on marijuana use .\nMarijuana is currently classified under the Controlled Substances Act as `` Schedule I , '' much like heroin or cocaine , with a high likelihood for abuse and no medical value .\n`` What is and is n't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress , '' Obama told Tapper during the CNN interview .
