Let 's say it was just about everything to him and to his early supporters . Remember that five minutes into his announcement that he was running for president , Trump started laying into Mexicans as rapists , drug mules , disease-carriers , and all the rest .\nAttacking illegal immigration was his campaign in its earliest incarnation . He railed against `` sanctuary cities '' and the nonexistent crime waves caused by illegal immigrants all over the country . He talked incessantly about his big , beautiful wall on the country 's southern border and how Mexico would pay for it . In a characteristic outburst on the subject , Trump told NBC 's Chuck Todd that he would even kick out kids who were U.S. citizens but whose parents were illegal . `` They 've got to go ! '' he told the newsman on his private jet . `` They 've got to go ! ''\nDespite ranking low-to-nonexistent among the concerns of Republican voters , addressing the supposedly ruinous influx of mostly Hispanic illegals remains central to many , if not most , professional conservatives and right-wingers . `` Conservatives are now starting to see a candidate 's position on immigration as an index of his conservatism in general , '' wrote National Review 's Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg View . `` Favoring tighter control of immigration is becoming a stand-in for conservatism . '' Indeed , the main beef with the # NeverTrumpers at the conservative National Review was precisely that The Donald was n't serious when he promised to deport 11 million people upon taking office . As NR 's editors wrote in their house editorial , `` Conservatives against Trump '' :\nTrump says he will put a big door in his beautiful wall , an implicit endorsement of the dismayingly conventional view that current levels of legal immigration are fine\u2026 . Trump piles on the absurdity by saying he would re-import many of the illegal immigrants once they had been deported , which makes his policy a poorly disguised amnesty .\nWell , it turns out that they were right . Here 's Trump talking yesterday on Fox News ' Hannity about his new-and-improved policy toward illegal immigrants :\nDuring a `` Hannity '' town hall on Tuesday , Trump said he was open to `` softening '' laws dealing with illegal immigrants . On Wednesday , Trump told Hannity there would be `` no citizenship '' for those illegal immigrants . `` Let me go a step further\u2014they 'll pay back-taxes , they have to pay taxes , there 's no amnesty , as such , there 's no amnesty , but we work with them , '' Trump said . He also spoke of how hard it would be to deport people who have lived in the country for decades and raised a family . `` Now , everybody agrees we get the bad ones out , '' Trump said . `` But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject , and I 've had very strong people come up to me , really great , great people come up to me , and they 've said , 'Mr .
