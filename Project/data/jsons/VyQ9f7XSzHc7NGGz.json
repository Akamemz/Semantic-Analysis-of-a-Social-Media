The debate about whether to extend those benefits this summer has touched off fierce debate in Washington over the extent to which continued aid is necessary to stimulate a sagging economy .\nSome White House officials and Republicans say the extra payments are creating a disincentive for people to return to the workforce , potentially holding back the economic recovery . But so far there is no consensus over how to proceed , with some calling for phasing out the benefits entirely and others supporting a one-time payment that could encourage Americans to return to work .\n\u201c In certain cases , we \u2019 re actually paying people more than they made , so we have to fix that , \u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a live stream hosted by the Hill news organization .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) blasted the expanded benefits as a \u201c crazy policy \u201d in a private meeting with lawmakers Wednesday , according to a person familiar with the remarks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal details of the meeting . The party \u2019 s position is backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which on Thursday joined Republicans in arguing that the extra payments might deter people from returning to work .\nThe renewed Republican opposition has incensed some congressional Democrats , who instead have sought to maintain and augment federal unemployment aid . During the Great Recession , lawmakers from both parties extended expanded unemployment benefits because so many Americans struggled to find work , particularly when long-term joblessness became a growing problem . The unemployment rate in April hit 14.7 percent , higher than any point during the Great Recession , suggesting that the unemployment benefit challenges could prove even more complicated this time .\nDemocrats argue along with a stable of economists that the expanded jobless benefits are critical at a time when Americans have lost their jobs through no fault of their own \u2014 and desperately need the money to pay their bills and protect their homes .\n\u201c The worst thing Republicans can do to the economy and American families is to allow supercharged unemployment benefits to expire , \u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) .\nThe White House declined to comment for this story .

These and other states later made immense progress in reducing their backlogs , though delays still remain . More than 200,000 out-of-work Americans are in line for payments in Florida , state data show , while the New York backlog stands at about 44,000 , the state reported Wednesday . About 7,000 claims had been pending review there for roughly a month .\n\u201c The economic need is not going away , \u201d said Martha Gimbel , a labor economist at Schmidt Futures . \u201c The fact that we are two months into this , and we \u2019 re still getting multi-million claims numbers , speaks to how deep and intense the economic pain is right now . \u201d\nThe threat of a protracted downturn prompted Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H.
