    "content": "With three full days left in the campaign , Donald Trump \u2019 s pathway to the presidency is narrow , defined and unforgiving .\nIt begins by the Republican nominee , who continues to trail Hillary Clinton in most national polls , sweeping three must-win electorally rich battleground states : Ohio ( 18 electoral votes ) , Florida ( 29 ) and North Carolina ( 15 ) .\nThose states are hardly a certainty . In Florida , surveys show the race is knotted . In North Carolina , Trump has trailed in 20 of the 24 polls since the first debate . He looks strongest in Ohio where he has led or tied in the last nine polls .\nFrom there , Trump must also hold all the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012 , including Utah , Arizona and Georgia .\nIn Utah , where Trump \u2019 s favorability rating is shockingly low , he is fending off Clinton , independent challenger Evan McMullin and Libertarian Gary Johnson . In Arizona , Clinton has launched a last-minute incursion for its 11 electoral votes , as both she and running mate Tim Kaine have campaigned there and flooded the airwaves with anti-Trump ads in the increasingly Hispanic state . ( Georgia is far more of a reach for the Democratic ticket . )\n\u201c Basically , what he \u2019 s got to do is draw an inside straight , \u201d said Whit Ayres , a longtime Republican pollster .\nIf Trump wins Florida and Ohio and North Carolina ( and protects the GOP turn of Arizona and Utah and Georgia ) , he would stand at 253 electoral votes \u2014 17 shy of the magic number of 270 .\nThose final 17 electoral votes have proved trickiest . Here are his treacherous paths :\nOn paper , this is the simplest and fastest path . Trump needs only to add Pennsylvania \u2019 s 20 electoral votes to win . But the reality on the ground is far thornier . Trump has trailed in 39 consecutive Pennsylvania polls , dating back to the conventions ( though one GOP poll this week showed it tied ) .\nTrump has visited over and over , targeting it perhaps foremost as the state in the so-called blue wall \u2014 states and D.C. that have gone Democratic in every contest since 1992 worth a combined 242 electoral votes \u2014 that he hopes to steal back . It was in Pennsylvania that Trump delivered his big anti-trade speech months ago as his campaign hoped to gin up protectionist-favoring turnout in the mining-heavy and more conservative western and central regions of the state .\nBut Trump \u2019 s long history of attacks on women have hamstrung him in the voter-rich Philadelphia suburbs . A Monmouth University poll this week showed Clinton up 62 percent to 29 percent in Philadelphia and its suburbs . So it was no accident that those suburban counties were where Trump campaigned with running mate Mike Pence against Obamacare on Tuesday , and where the campaign had Melania Trump deliver her first solo speech on Thursday .\nPennsylvania has proved a tempting mirage for Republicans in years past , as it was the sixth closest swing state in 2012 , with Romney losing by a little more than 5 percentage points after a late push . Clinton and the Democrats have circled the state as their firewall since the summer .\nOne wild card is this state does not allow early voting so Clinton \u2019 s fearsome get-out-the-vote machinery has been unable to flex its muscle . Motivating voters on the eve of the election is one reason Clinton herself and Vice President Joe Biden will be in different parts of the state throughout the weekend . And the fact that Clinton will hold her final big rally of the race in Philadelphia on Monday is no accident . It will be her first joint event with the combined firepower of President Bill Clinton , President Obama , and Michelle Obama .\nIowa ( 6 ) , Nevada ( 6 ) , Maine-2 ( 1 ) , New Hampshire ( 4 ) : 270 electoral votes\nIf Trump can \u2019 t win Pennsylvania \u2014 and there are few outward positive signs there \u2014 every other path requires carrying multiple states .\nClinton operatives concede that Iowa , along with Ohio , is the swing state they are most likely to lose next Tuesday . In fact , some political operatives see it as more likely that Trump carries Iowa \u2014 a very white state \u2014 than more diverse Florida and North Carolina . The trouble for Trump is it is only worth six electoral college votes .\nTrump has shown some signs of late movement in Nevada , adding a stop there Saturday as one CNN survey shows him ahead . The state presents two fascinating demographic cross currents : it is the most Hispanic swing state in the country while at the same time home to the fewest white voters with a college degree of any battleground . The former vote overwhelmingly for Clinton ; the latter for Trump .\nHe \u2019 ll need more pick-ups : carrying Maine \u2019 s more rural second congressional district ( where he has campaigned repeatedly for one electoral vote ) and where polls have shown a competitive race , and New Hampshire .\nNew Hampshire , of course , was the home to Trump \u2019 s first primary victory . But he has trailed there in every general election poll since July \u2014 until this week . Then , all of a sudden , three surveys in recent days have shown him ahead ( though two were from pollsters with an unreliable records ) . Both Clinton and Trump will visit New Hampshire again between now and the election .\nAmong Democrats , New Hampshire and Pennsylvania have been widely viewed as Clinton \u2019 s firewall states . They are the places she could make a stand , even if things go south elsewhere . Because if she holds onto both places , she could win even if she loses in Ohio , Florida , North Carolina , Iowa , Nevada , Arizona and Maine \u2019 s second district .\nCombine Iowa ( 6 ) and/or Nevada ( 6 ) with some wild card state : Michigan ( 16 ) , Wisconsin ( 10 ) , Virginia ( 13 ) , Colorado ( 9 ) , New Mexico ( 5 )\nTrump has launched a last-ditch effort to expand the map in these final weeks , campaigning in New Mexico on October 30 , Michigan on October 31 , and Wisconsin on November 1 . He \u2019 s bought ads in those three states , and added more in Colorado and Virginia , two states that Clinton stopped advertising in because her lead had grown so large .\nThe Trump campaign has sold this as going on offense following the fresh FBI review of Clinton aide Huma Abedin \u2019 s emails .\nBut while it is true that Trump \u2019 s standing has improved , even Republicans sense it is unlikely he is suddenly flipping states that Democrats had locked up earlier in the cycle .\n\u201c When the FBI thing hit , you saw Trump bump his ceiling by two points , \u201d said Republican pollster Ed Goeas . That \u2019 s the good news . The bad news , Goeas said : \u201c He \u2019 s still behind her . \u201d\nTo get to 270 , Trump would have to add either Virginia or Michigan to an Iowa win , or add Iowa plus some unlikely combination of these other states .\nEarlier in the cycle , Trump \u2019 s team had touted his \u201c Rust Belt \u201d strategy of flipping Ohio , Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin with his populist and protectionist message .

(Georgia is far more of a reach for the Democratic ticket.)\n\nThose are just the table stakes for Trump.\n\n\u201cBasically, what he\u2019s got to do is draw an inside straight,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster.\n\nIf Trump wins Florida and Ohio and North Carolina (and protects the GOP turn of Arizona and Utah and Georgia), he would stand at 253 electoral votes \u2014 17 shy of the magic number of 270.\n\nThose final 17 electoral votes have proved trickiest. Here are his treacherous paths:\n\n1. Win the Keystone State\n\nPennsylvania (20): 273 electoral votes\n\nOn paper, this is the simplest and fastest path.

And the fact that Clinton will hold her final big rally of the race in Philadelphia on Monday is no accident. It will be her first joint event with the combined firepower of President Bill Clinton, President Obama, and Michelle Obama.\n\n2. Cobble together four states\n\nIowa (6), Nevada (6), Maine-2 (1), New Hampshire (4): 270 electoral votes\n\nIf Trump can\u2019t win Pennsylvania \u2014 and there are few outward positive signs there \u2014 every other path requires carrying multiple states.\n\nClinton operatives concede that Iowa, along with Ohio, is the swing state they are most likely to lose next Tuesday.

The trouble for Trump is it is only worth six electoral college votes.\n\nSo he\u2019d only be at 259.\n\nTrump has shown some signs of late movement in Nevada, adding a stop there Saturday as one CNN survey shows him ahead. The state presents two fascinating demographic cross currents: it is the most Hispanic swing state in the country while at the same time home to the fewest white voters with a college degree of any battleground. The former vote overwhelmingly for Clinton; the latter for Trump.\n\nWin there, and he\u2019s at 265.\n\nHe\u2019ll need more pick-ups: carrying Maine\u2019s more rural second congressional district (where he has campaigned repeatedly for one electoral vote) and where polls have shown a competitive race, and New Hampshire.\n\nNew Hampshire, of course, was the home to Trump\u2019s first primary victory.

Because if she holds onto both places, she could win even if she loses in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada, Arizona and Maine\u2019s second district.\n\nWhich would leave Trump with one final shot...\n\n3. Pull off a shocker\n\nCombine Iowa (6) and/or Nevada (6) with some wild card state: Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10), Virginia (13), Colorado (9), New Mexico (5)\n\nTrump has launched a last-ditch effort to expand the map in these final weeks, campaigning in New Mexico on October 30, Michigan on October 31, and Wisconsin on November 1.
