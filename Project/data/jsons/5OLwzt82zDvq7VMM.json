    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) America 's political polarization is so deep that Republicans and Democrats ca n't even agree on what to talk about in the aftermath of the shooting in San Bernardino , California , that left 14 dead .\nInstead , both sides on Thursday sought to frame the tragedy to reflect their own political ends on the thorny issues of guns and terrorism , which are key motivating issues for their most committed voters .\nAt the White House , President Barack Obama again faced the cameras to make another pitch for curbs on firearms -- remarks similar to those he 's delivered after mass shootings this year in South Carolina Oregon and now San Bernardino\n`` It is going to be important for all of us , including our legislatures , to see what we can do to make sure that when individuals decide they want to do somebody harm , we are making it a little harder for them to do it , '' he said . `` Because , right now , it 's just too easy . ''\nA few blocks away , every Republican presidential candidate gathered to speak to a group of conservative Jewish voters . But on the issue of guns , they might as well have been worlds apart , seeking to frame the violence in California as an example of potential terrorism and not a reason to open yet another debate over the Second Amendment .\nHe went on : `` Whether or not the current administration realizes it or is willing to acknowledge it , our enemies are at war with us . And I believe our nation needs a wartime president to defend it . ''\nGOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump referred to the attack as `` probably '' related to radical Islamic terrorism and used it to advance his critique of Obama .\n`` We have a president that refuses to use the term , '' Trump said . `` He refuses to say it -- I 'll tell you there is something going on with him that we do n't know about . ''\nThe disconnect does not just reflect the inertia and deep polarization on Second Amendment rights that has prevented the adoption of even modest firearms measures despite a string of mass shootings . It also demonstrates the way GOP candidates are seizing on new fears about terrorism to hammer the Obama legacy and present themselves as tough potential commanders-in-chief . The issue also plays into the anti-government fervor that is animating the GOP race .\nThere was no sign of any convergence over the political aisle in the wake of the attack , underscoring the nation 's painful split between left and right .\nThe speed at which politicians took on the issue was especially notable because authorities in Washington and California have yet to establish exactly what motivated the attackers . Obama said there could have been a mix of motives , including terrorism or work place violence .\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN it appeared Syed Rizwan Farook , who along with his wife Tashfeen Malik carried out the shooting , may have been radicalized and had `` soft connections '' with more than one subject of international terrorism investigations .\nBut much about the rest of the attack remained unclear Thursday .\nRepublicans , however , did not wait for confirmation of a terrorism link and do n't need a second chance to mete out tough rhetoric and chide Obama 's anti-terrorism legacy .\nAt one point , Trump even said that his poll numbers rise whenever there 's a tragedy because Americans feel he would protect them .\nAnd New Jersey Republican Gov . Chris Christie , who is brandishing his muscular credentials as a former prosecutor to try to rescue his trailing campaign , left even less room for nuance than Cruz .\n`` I am convinced that was a terrorist attack , '' he said . `` We need to come to grips with the idea that we are in the midst of the next world war .
