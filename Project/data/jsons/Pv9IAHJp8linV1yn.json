Weapons depots and rocket-launching sites were also targeted .\n`` Hamas and the other terrorist organizations in Gaza have made normal life impossible for over 1 million Israelis , '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement . `` No government would tolerate a situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant barrage of rockets and missile fire . ''\nPalestinian leaders condemned the attacks and said it is just another example of Israel 's aggression toward Gaza . Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 , Israel has imposed a crippling economic embargo on the territory because it views Hamas as a terrorist organization bent on destroying the state of Israel .\nMeanwhile , Hamas ' military wing vowed revenge , warning that Israel had opened `` the gates of hell on themselves . ''\nSince then , Israel and Hamas have been trading bombs and rockets , and there is international concern that the situation could escalate into an even bloodier ground war . The Israeli government has called up 75,000 reservists and massed 30,000 troops across the border of the Palestinian territory , according to the Israel Defense Forces .\n`` If this situation continues and it escalates , it 's going to be really serious and tragic -- not just for Israelis and Palestinians , but actually it will cause a huge amount of upheaval right across the region , '' said former British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who is envoy for the Middle East Quartet working to find a peace agreement . `` And this is a region , as you know , that does n't require more upheaval right now . ''\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon flew to the region Monday to personally appeal for a cease-fire , joining a chorus of Western and Arab leaders who do not want to see a repeat of 2009 , when a three-week ground offensive resulted in the deaths of at least 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .\nBut not all of those leaders view the conflict similarly .\nMany of the Western nations , including the United States and several European countries , see Hamas as the aggressor . U.S. President Barack Obama , speaking in Thailand on Sunday , said Hamas rocket attacks were the `` precipitating '' event for the fighting and that `` we are actively working with all the parties in the region to see if we can end those missiles being fired without further escalation of violence . '' The United States , like Israel , views Hamas as a terrorist organization .\nJUST WATCHED Gaza explosion rocks CNN live report Replay More Videos ...

Egypt , for example , recalled its ambassador to Israel and delivered a formal protest to the Israeli government .\n`` No one can remain still and watch this tragedy unfold in this fashion , '' Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil said Friday . `` This is impossible . The whole world must intervene , and Israel must abide by the agreements and stop the aggression . ''\nKandil visited a Gaza hospital and kissed the lifeless body of a 4-year-old boy said to have been killed by an Israeli airstrike . The Israeli military told CNN , however , that it did not carry out any strikes at the time of the child 's death ; it said it had stopped temporarily for Kandil 's visit .\nThe death of civilians , especially children , has been a common rallying cry for critics of Israel 's offensive . Ten people , including several children , were pulled from the rubble after one airstrike in Gaza , as CNN 's Arwa Damon witnessed .\nIsraeli authorities said they go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties in densely populated Gaza , even dropping leaflets and nonlethal bombs to warn people about bombings in advance . But `` the terrorists , '' Netanyahu said , `` are committing a double war crime : They fire at Israeli civilians , and they hide behind Palestinian civilians . '' And sometimes , according to a tweet from the Israeli military , `` Hamas fires from civilian areas and hits its own people . ''\nBoth Israel and Hamas have taken to Twitter to defend their cause and sway outside opinion . One recent graphic , tweeted from the account of Hamas ' military wing , said Israel is n't killing terrorists in Gaza ; it 's killing children , senior citizens and women .\nThe Israeli military tweeted a graphic that asked , `` What would you do if rockets were striking your country ? RT if you agree that # Israel has the right to self-defense .
