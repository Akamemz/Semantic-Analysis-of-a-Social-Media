    "content": "In recent months , the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden have described the N.S.A. \u2019 s reach in scooping up vast amounts of communications around the world . The encryption documents now show , in striking detail , how the agency works to ensure that it is actually able to read the information it collects .\nThe agency \u2019 s success in defeating many of the privacy protections offered by encryption does not change the rules that prohibit the deliberate targeting of Americans \u2019 e-mails or phone calls without a warrant . But it shows that the agency , which was sharply rebuked by a federal judge in 2011 for violating the rules and misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , can not necessarily be restrained by privacy technology . N.S.A . rules permit the agency to store any encrypted communication , domestic or foreign , for as long as the agency is trying to decrypt it or analyze its technical features .\nThe N.S.A. , which has specialized in code-breaking since its creation in 1952 , sees that task as essential to its mission . If it can not decipher the messages of terrorists , foreign spies and other adversaries , the United States will be at serious risk , agency officials say .\nJust in recent weeks , the Obama administration has called on the intelligence agencies for details of communications by leaders of Al Qaeda about a terrorist plot and of Syrian officials \u2019 messages about the chemical weapons attack outside Damascus . If such communications can be hidden by unbreakable encryption , N.S.A . officials say , the agency can not do its work .\nBut some experts say the N.S.A. \u2019 s campaign to bypass and weaken communications security may have serious unintended consequences . They say the agency is working at cross-purposes with its other major mission , apart from eavesdropping : ensuring the security of American communications .\nSome of the agency \u2019 s most intensive efforts have focused on the encryption in universal use in the United States , including Secure Sockets Layer , or SSL ; virtual private networks , or VPNs ; and the protection used on fourth-generation , or 4G , smartphones . Many Americans , often without realizing it , rely on such protection every time they send an e-mail , buy something online , consult with colleagues via their company \u2019 s computer network , or use a phone or a tablet on a 4G network .\nFor at least three years , one document says , GCHQ , almost certainly in collaboration with the N.S.A. , has been looking for ways into protected traffic of popular Internet companies : Google , Yahoo , Facebook and Microsoft \u2019 s Hotmail . By 2012 , GCHQ had developed \u201c new access opportunities \u201d into Google \u2019 s systems , according to the document .
