It \u2019 s a very bad thing , \u201d Moshe Feiglin , a member of Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s right-of-center Likud party , told Israel Radio .\n\u201c But the situation was impossible .... The firings were definitely necessary . I don \u2019 t think he had another choice . \u201d\nMr. Feiglin said the government collapsed because a lack of a common agenda among Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s nationalist party and dovish parties pushing for a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians .\nMr. Lapid is leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party , while Ms. Livni heads the Ha \u2019 tnuah party .\nOn Monday night , Mr. Netanyahu summoned Mr. Lapid for a meeting to discuss their differences , an encounter that didn \u2019 t go well , according to both sides . Mr. Netanyahu presented Mr. Lapid with a list of five concessions on domestic issues , including an ultimatum on the budget and a demand Mr. Lapid stop \u201c constantly attacking the government \u201d in public , a statement from Mr. Netanyahu said .\nAfter he was dismissed on Tuesday , Mr. Lapid said : \u201c The firing of ministers is an act of cowardice and loss of control . \u201d\nMr. Netanyahu \u2019 s move sets Israel on course for new parliamentary elections in the coming months .\nSome here see a new vulnerability in the longtime prime minister . Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s appeal is sinking domestically .\nOn Sunday , a public-opinion poll published in Israeli newspaper Haaretz showed his approval rating had fallen to 38 % from the 50 % at the end of the Gaza war in August and 77 % during the height of that conflict .\nThe numbers \u201c are very low , compared to his own position even six months ago and compared to what you expect from an incumbent , \u201d said Eyal Arad , a former campaign consultant to Mr. Netanyahu and other candidates .\nLacking other issues , the main topic of the campaign may be Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s performance , he added .\n\u201c If we have a referendum on the incumbent in a couple of months and his numbers are in the 30s , I would say he \u2019 s jumping from the 10th floor without a safety net , \u201d Mr. Arad said .\nMr. Netanyahu has come under pressure from all directions this year . Sparring over the domestic agenda suddenly reached a fever pitch several weeks ago , straining his coalition . The 50-day war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip was soon followed by a wave of violence in Jerusalem , leading politicians and analysts across the spectrum to say the prime minister lacked a strategy to deal with Palestinian attacks on Israelis .\n\u201c The conventional wisdom that became dominant here that there is no alternative to Bibi is no longer solid , \u201d said Tal Schneider , a political analyst , referring to the prime minister by his nickname . \u201c We can definitely see anti-Bibi sentiment all over the political map this year . \u201d\nFrustration with the prime minister has also has also come into relief on the Knesset floor recently , leading some once-loyal lawmakers to abandon Mr. Netanyahu .\nOn Nov. 12 , members of Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s coalition lined up to force a free newspaper called Yisrael Hayom to charge money , a move the premier vehemently opposed .
