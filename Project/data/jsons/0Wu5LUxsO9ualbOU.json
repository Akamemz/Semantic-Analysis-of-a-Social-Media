He imposed a cruel policy of Indian removal , forcing the tribes of the Southeast across a brutal march to the Oklahoma territory . He was a hot-headed general , quick to violence and known to overstep his legal bounds , as when he summarily executed two Britons for aiding the Indian enemy during the First Seminole War .\nOn some levels , it \u2019 s easy to understand the campaign to remove Andrew Jackson \u2019 s mug from the $ 20 bill . Pundits are rushing to endorse the idea . The leading candidate to replace him appears to be the morally unimpeachable Harriet Tubman , who used the Underground Railroad to free herself and dozens of other slaves from bondage .\nWhen Barack Obama first ran for president , he joked that he didn \u2019 t \u201c look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills. \u201d It is certainly time for our currency to bear the faces of African Americans and women . But this admirable effort shouldn \u2019 t come at Andrew Jackson \u2019 s expense . Jackson was a deeply flawed president and in many ways a detestable man . Yet he was also a towering hero , key to birthing the expansive American democracy we know today . It \u2019 s entirely possible to honor his enduring contributions even as we squarely acknowledge his crimes . Grappling with those paradoxes and contradictions is what distinguishes history from moralism or sentimentality .\nThe anti-Jackson campaign represents the overripe fruit of two generations of anti-Jackson scholarship . A century ago , progressive historians like Charles Beard saw Old Hickory as the champion of the frontier farmers and workers , fighting the Eastern moneyed classes ; decades later Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. focused on Jackson \u2019 s fiercely democratic politics , his class appeal rather than his sectional appeal . But in the 1970s New Left historians such as Michael Paul Rogin , awakening to problems his predecessors had ignored , placed Indian removal at the core of Jackson \u2019 s legacy and racism at the heart of his vision . More recently Jackson \u2019 s warlike nature and contempt for modern notions of civil liberties and due process have stained his reputation even more deeply . For years now , this unforgiving picture has been a staple of high-school lesson plans and popular culture .\nUnfortunately , these high school-level popular understandings of Jackson typically veer into the cartoonish .

As the historian Sean Wilentz writes in his short biography of Jackson , in those early years in government he supported taxing slaves , since taxing land alone would reward wealthy plantation owners ; and he joined a small group in opposing a feel-good resolution extolling the Washington administration when the first president retired , seeing it as a self-flattering gesture of the elite .\nLater , when Jackson returned to politics after two decades earning fame as a general , it was again as a tribune of disenfranchised groups that were now claiming their place at the democratic table . States were starting to abolish property requirements for voting and to adopt what was called universal ( white ) manhood suffrage . The extension of the vote to even poor or working-class men helped give American political culture the vigorous , egalitarian spirit that Tocqueville immortalized in Democracy in America after he toured the country in 1831 .",
