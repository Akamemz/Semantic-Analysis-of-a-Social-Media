''\nBut while concluding that the federal government has the power to block the law , the court let stand one of the most controversial parts : a provision that lets police check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws if `` reasonable suspicion '' exists that the person is in the United States illegally . Critics said that law opens the door to racial profiling .\n`` There is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced , '' Kennedy wrote , making clear that Arizona authorities must comply with federal law in conducting the immigration status checks or face further constitutional challenges .\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety and the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police said it was n't immediately clear whether authorities would begin checking motorists ' immigration status while enforcing other laws . They referred questions to the Arizona attorney general 's office , which did not immediately return a call Monday from CNN seeking comment , but Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer told reporters she expected the provision would go into effect immediately .\nJUST WATCHED Court to Arizona : You went too far Replay More Videos ...

'' In an interview on CNN 's `` John King USA , '' she said Arizona police and sheriff 's deputies have been trained to avoid racial profiling , `` and they do n't profile . ''\nPresident Barack Obama also expressed concern that immigration status checks allowed by Monday 's ruling could lead to racial profiling by police . In a written statement , Obama said , `` No American should ever live under a cloud of suspicion just because of what they look like . ''\nAnd his administration said it would not assist Arizona 's efforts . Administration officials announced Thursday that they have canceled agreements that allowed some Arizona police departments to enforce federal immigration laws , and the Justice Department set up a telephone hotline and e-mail address for the public to report civil rights concerns about the law 's enforcement .\n`` I think this is another assault on the state of Arizona , '' she told CNN . `` It began with them downplaying our border problem and them not securing it , and then , you know , suing the state of Arizona for trying to protect the people of Arizona and of America , then doing backdoor amnesty . ''\nBrewer told reporters earlier that she expected further lawsuits on the immigration status checks , adding , `` this certainly is not the end of our journey . ''\nOpponents of the Arizona law have dubbed the immigration-status provision the `` show me your papers '' law , arguing that it unfairly targets Latinos .\n`` I know they will not be using that kind of tactic on people with the last name Roberts , Romney , or Brewer , but if your name is something like Gutierrez or Chung or Obama , watch out , '' said U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D-Illinois . `` The express goal of the authors of Arizona 's SB 1070 is to make life miserable for immigrants so that they will leave , and a key tool in that effort was upheld by the court . ''\nAnd Rep. Charles Gonzalez , the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , told `` John King USA '' that he expects the Arizona law will lead to racial profiling `` on a grand scale '' and eventually come back before the court .\n`` My prediction is that the other shoe will drop , and that this fourth provision will be ruled unconstitutional , '' said Gonzalez , D-Texas .\nMeanwhile , former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney , Obama 's presumptive Republican challenger in November 's election , blamed the president for what he called a `` muddle '' left in the wake of the court 's ruling .\n`` The president promised in his campaign that in his first year , he would take on immigration and solve our immigration challenges , put in place a long-term program to care for those who want to come here legally , to deal with illegal immigration , to deal with securing our borders , '' Romney said during a campaign stop in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale , Arizona . `` All these things he was going to in his first year . He had a Democrat House and a Democrat Senate , but he did n't do it . Is n't it time for the American people to ask him why ?

The American Civil Liberties Union issued a travel alert for Arizona , and dozens of groups canceled meetings or conventions . The federal government challenged four provisions of the Arizona law that never were enforced , pending the legal ruling .\n-- Authorizing police to arrest illegal immigrants without warrant where `` probable cause '' exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country .\n-- Making it a state crime for `` unauthorized immigrants '' to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification .\n-- Forbidding those not authorized for employment in the United States to apply , solicit or perform work .

Such prioritizing of resources was cited as the basis for a recent decision to halt deportations of some young illegal immigrants who came to America as children , had clean records and were students or served in the military .\nIn his dissent , Scalia noted such selective enforcement of immigration laws , writing , `` To say , as the Court does , that Arizona contradicts federal law by enforcing applications of the Immigration Act that the President declines to enforce boggles the mind . ''\nSeveral other states followed Arizona 's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants . Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia , Alabama , Utah , Indiana and South Carolina . Arizona 's appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court .\n`` Hopefully today 's decision will spur the federal government to enforce the rule of law in the immigration arena , '' said a statement by Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange . `` My office will be reviewing today 's decision to determine the full extent of its impact on Alabama 's law and the pending litigation . ''\nDan Kowalski , editor-in-chief of Bender 's Immigration Bulletin and an immigration lawyer at the Fowler Law Firm in Austin , Texas , said Monday 's ruling means states have to `` really almost go back to square one and really rethink their approach and how much time and money they want to put into these types of statutes . ''\n`` They 're going to have to spend a lot of money on lawyers to try to craft something that they think can withstand Supreme Court scrutiny , '' he said , adding that states also will `` have to budget money for further litigation because , no matter what they propose on a state level , it 's going to be challenged . That costs a lot of money . So they 're going to have to figure out if it 's worth it .
