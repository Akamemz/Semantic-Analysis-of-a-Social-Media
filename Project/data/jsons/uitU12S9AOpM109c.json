''\nSo said President-elect Barack Obama at a Washington Post editorial board meeting in January 2009 , just days before taking his first oath of office .

When you look at the pathetic support for Bowles-Simpson when it was actually put to a vote in the House last March -- 16 Republicans and 22 Democrats supported it -- you see why cynicism is always a safe bet in Washington .\nBut take a step back , and you 'll see much broader support among the American people . The Pew Research Center found that the top three issues are `` strengthening the economy '' ( at 86 % ) , `` improving the jobs situation '' ( 79 % ) and `` reducing the budget deficit '' ( at 72 % ) . Crucially , the deficit has shown the biggest increase as an issue over the past four years -- up 19 percentage points from 2009 . This is evidence of a pent-up demand for action -- but it will require presidential leadership .\nOf course the devil is in the details , and politicos will point out that when confronted with tough medicine to deal with deficits and debt , even alleged tea party supporters balk ( hence the classic `` Government Get Your Hands Off My Medicare ! '' sign that I saw at one 2009 rally ) .\nBut strengthening America to remain competitive in the 21st century will require getting our long-term debt under control along with other important but less poll-prioritized policies such as comprehensive immigration reform and a public-private infrastructure bank to fund nation-building `` here at home . ''\nThe State of the Union is a chance for the president to put forward a balanced bipartisan solution that contrasts with radical conservatives who believe that increased tax revenues from closed tax loopholes ca n't be part of a big deal to bring down our debt . Wall Street lawyers will fight to protect every loophole they embedded in our tax code , but their argument does n't begin to make sense to people on Main Street .\nObama will probably point out Tuesday night that economic growth is the essential X Factor to reducing long-term deficits and debt . On this point at least , he and some conservatives might agree . But dumb meat cleaver cuts such as the looming sequestration could push our economy back into recession .\nThat 's why a smart balanced alternative plan is necessary . But it will require presidential leadership and putting some Democratic sacred cows on the table .\nThis does n't just make practical sense in a divided government ( a reality some Democrats seem to forget ) -- it makes compelling political sense as well . By seizing the mantle of fiscal responsibility -- in contrast to fiscal conservatism -- Obama will build on his post-election bump among centrists and some independents .\nThe more Machiavellian Democrats might argue that this outreach could only serve to isolate Republicans more . Nonpartisan strategists might argue that this approach would drive a wedge between reasonable Republicans and the House radicals .\nBut the real reason for Obama to address the need to reduce long-term deficits and debt directly is because it 's the right thing to do for our country -- and he is uniquely positioned to achieve it . Just as Nixon could go to China , a Southern Democrat such as Lyndon Johnson was needed to pass civil rights legislation and Bill Clinton was able to sign welfare reform after decades of Republicans talking about it , Obama can put our country on a balanced path of long-term economic growth and fiscal responsibility .\nBottom line : Obama has the political opportunity , but does he have the political will ?
