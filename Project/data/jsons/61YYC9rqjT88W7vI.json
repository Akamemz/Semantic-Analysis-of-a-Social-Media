    "content": "The massacre in Orlando was the first big test of the 2016 general election campaign , and it exposed Donald Trump \u2019 s penchant for behaving reality-show small during moments that historically demand the stature of a president .\nTrump had a potent policy point to make \u2014 that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are soft on radical Islamic terrorism \u2014 a view that , if articulated carefully , could move the presumptive GOP nominee out of his electoral cul-de-sac of white Republicans and right-wing independents .\n\u201c Last night , our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist , \u201d Trump wrote in a statement released late Sunday , summing up the sentiments of most Republicans and many independents who think Obama and Clinton are weak on religiously fueled acts of terror .\nBut few will remember that , not with the way Trump behaved in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history . He could have appeared dignified , controlled , in-command , following the time-tested presidential path blazed by George W. Bush in 2001 and Obama on Sunday . Instead , he bellowed like Ralph Kramden throwing an I-told-you-so over his shoulder at passengers on his bus .\n\u201c Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism , \u201d Trump tweeted triumphantly mid-Sunday , as the FBI and Orlando police were still pulling bodies from Pulse , a gay nightclub where at least 49 innocents were gunned down . \u201c I don \u2019 t want congrats , I want toughness and vigilance . \u201d\nThen , later , another self-inflicted pat on the back : \u201c If we do not get tough and smart real fast , we are not going to have a country anymore , \u201d he added . \u201c I said this was going to happen \u2014 and it is only going to get worse . \u201d\nThe two presidential candidates , one who whispered and one who roared , will engage directly on Monday . Clinton has canceled her first dual campaign appearance with Obama in Wisconsin on Wednesday and is expected to deliver more extensive remarks on Orlando on Monday . Trump scrapped a scheduled Monday rally in Portsmouth , New Hampshire , to deliver an address dealing with \u201c the serious threats facing all Americans \u201d at a Manchester-area college .\nThey both will confront an attack in Orlando , Disney \u2019 s town , that is as hard to comprehend politically as it is to absorb emotionally \u2014 an atrocity that defies the easy political pigeonholing candidates and reporters crave .\nThe shooter was , according to late reports , inspired by the terrorist group known as ISIS or ISIL \u2014 but he was a New York-born American citizen who spoke unaccented English and led a middle-class life . And while Omar Mateen was clearly motivated by his faith , he was also impelled by raw bigotry \u2014 reportedly targeting a gay night club because he was disgusted by the sight of men kissing men . Complicating matters , Mateen \u2019 s crime seems to have less to do with bad anti-terror policy than iffy oversight : The FBI investigated him twice , then let him fall of its radar , and he worked as a gun-toting security guard for years despite suspected sympathies with radical Middle Eastern terror groups .\nIn poll after poll , voters of all stripes have identified terrorism as a top concern . But the public is sending mixed messages about which candidate \u2014 the former secretary of state on duty during Benghazi or the rich-kid developer who accepted multiple draft deferments during Vietnam \u2014 is most qualified to be commander in chief .\nOnly 12 percent of respondents to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll earlier this month said Trump had the \u201c temperament \u201d to be president \u2014 but he \u2019 s consistently led her by double-digits among voters asked who would be better on the issue of terrorism . Few voters trust her , but Clinton defeats Trump decisively when people are asked who would improve the country \u2019 s standing in the world , and on issues of temperament and experience .\nDuring the Republican primary , Trump adopted the same damn-the-torpedoes approach he adopted Sunday \u2014 he infamously cited a fabricated account of Muslims dancing on New Jersey rooftops in the wake of 9/11 after terror attacks in Paris and Brussels \u2014 and saw his popularity increase .\nBut now he \u2019 s performing on a much bigger stage and voters have demanded a more measured approach . \u201c These are the moments that define a country , \u201d said Mo Elleithee , director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and a former Clinton staffer . \u201c You are either big and unifying or you \u2019 re not . \u201d\nIn both of their statements , Clinton and Obama took a vastly different approach than Trump , an effort to reassure born of shared liberalism and experiences with mass-casualty terrorism . They focused on the heroism of law enforcement , the emotional toll of the tragedy , and highlighted a tangle of other issues embodied by the killings \u2014 gun control , violence against the LGBT community and the broader societal issue of hate . In her statement , Clinton conflated \u201c terrorists or other violent criminals , \u201d infuriating even conservatives who detest their presumptive GOP nominee .\n\u201c We know enough to say that this was an act of terror and an act of hate , \u201d the president said a few hours earlier , in lockstep with the former rival he endorsed last week .\n\u201c The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends , to dance and to sing and to live\u2026 This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion or sexual orientation , is an attack on all of us . \u201d\nTwo bodies , victims of the nightclub massacre , arrive at the Orlando Medical Examiner 's Office on Sunday June 12 . | AP Photo\nTrump , at least initially , struck the statesman \u2019 s stance . Taking to Twitter , he called for prayer \u2014 and ( to the surprise of Clinton \u2019 s camp ) declined to immediately blame the attack on Islamic extremism before the FBI confirmed the connection .\nBut as the sun rose in the oppressively hot East , so did the candidate \u2019 s Twitter temperature .\nBy midday he was calling for Obama \u2019 s resignation for failing to confront the threat of Muslim extremism \u2014 then he electioneered against Clinton , retweeting a fan who wrote , \u201c We can not have Hillary as president . We will be in so much trouble . \u201d\nTim Miller , a former Jeb Bush aide , who has led the Stop Trump movement , summed up the views of many critics who accused the presumptive GOP nominee of turning an \u201c us \u201d moment into a \u201c me \u201d one . \u201c Someone who is so desperate for validation that they need to congratulate themselves after a terrorist attack has psychological issues they need to resolve , \u201d he said .\nFor once , however , here was an issue in which Trump won points for substance . James Woolsey , Bill Clinton \u2019 s CIA chief , told Fox News that Obama \u2019 s failure to call out Islamic extremism by name ( for fear of alienating anti-ISIL Muslim leaders in the region ) , was dangerous . \u201c This reluctance is doing real damage . You can \u2019 t effectively fight something if you can \u2019 t discuss it . \u201d\nThere is also a political counterargument for Trump \u2019 s unconventional course . He speaks the Lingua Americana of the white working class , even his critics acknowledge , and his call for a war on ISIL \u2014 as well as his proposal to ban the entry of new Muslim immigrants until the region stabilizes \u2014 has an appeal in battleground states . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot of people in Western Pennsylvania , some of them Democrats , who think this guy is the only one who knows what he \u2019 s doing , \u201d said a long-time Clinton aide . \u201c There \u2019 s some smugness on the campaign about this , but he \u2019 s dangerous . \u201d\nThe issue tends to break down along party lines \u2014 Democrats overwhelmingly oppose Trump \u2019 s Muslim ban , as many as 70 percent of GOP primary voters in some states expressed support , according to exit polls . But Trump \u2014 who has repeatedly touted his own \u201c strength \u201d while deriding Clinton , Obama , and just about everybody else as \u201c weak \u201d \u2014 could make inroads with an electorate increasingly shocked and anxious by the encroachment of terrorism on the homeland .\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans now have a negative view of Islam , according to a recent poll commissioned by left-leaning Brookings , although their views of individual Muslims are more sanguine .\nHow the American public will respond to Orlando remains the critical question and the most difficult to predict . Operatives in both campaigns said the reaction on Sunday was surprisingly muted \u2014 a product of a sleepy early summer weekend , shock , or , worst of all , a collective national feeling that mass shootings are , like tornadoes , naturally-occurring events that roar in and out at tolerable intervals .\nThe difference between the candidates \u2019 responses to the killings reflects a split in strategy \u2014 Trump sees foreign policy as a proxy for his flexed-bicep vision of a revived American foreign policy , besting China and Russia in artful international deals .
