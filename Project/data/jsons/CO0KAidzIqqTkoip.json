Clinton has lost between three and five points on her various rivals since Quinnipiac last surveyed Ohio in February .\nLook deeper in the data , and you see that much of this decline appears to have come from Republicans who previously supported Clinton drifting back to their preferred party .

In May that percentage dropped to 40 percent .\nThat could just be margin-of-error stuff , but we \u2019 d be watching that if we were on Clinton \u2019 s payroll .\nSecond , the Quinnipiac survey isn \u2019 t good for President Obama .
