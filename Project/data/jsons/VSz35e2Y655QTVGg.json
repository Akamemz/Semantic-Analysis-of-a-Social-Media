If we really wanted an assault weapons ban , we would be talking about a constitutional amendment . \u201d\nGun rights advocates were enraged ; one right-wing Texas lawmaker responded with what appeared to be a death threat . Even some Democrats\u2014who for years had assured voters that no one wants to confiscate their weapons\u2014worried that O \u2019 Rourke had gone too far . \u201c I frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying Democrats are coming for your guns , \u201d Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del . ) told CNN on Friday . Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey\u2014one of the few Republican supporters of gun control on Capitol Hill\u2014agreed . He suggested O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s comments could complicate negotiations to close loopholes that allow many gun-buyers to avoid being screened for mental health concerns and criminal records when they purchase firearms from private sellers . \u201c This rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts , like expanding background checks , \u201d he tweeted .\nBut according to some veterans of past legislative fights over background checks , unapologetic attempts to push the gun control envelope are exactly what is needed . \u201c Nobody who ever got half a loaf asked for half a loaf , \u201d says Mark Glaze , who served as the executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns\u2014now called Everytown for Gun Safety\u2014at the time of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . \u201c If we really wanted universal background checks , we \u2019 d be talking about an assault weapons ban . If we really wanted an assault weapons ban , we would be talking about a constitutional amendment . \u201d\nIn the wake of Sandy Hook , Glaze says , he attempted to plant a story that Senate Democrats and gun control groups were working on an assault weapons ban\u2014when the real goal was a modest measure sponsored by Toomey and Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-W.V . ) that would have expanded background checks to cover more , but not all , purchases . The bill , which had overwhelming public support , was ultimately blocked by Republican senators ( and a few Democrats ) in April 2013 .\nFor the first time since Manchin-Toomey \u2019 s spectacular failure , Congress and the White House may be ready to do something about the problem . Democrats are largely united behind a universal background checks bill passed earlier this year by the House , and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) says he \u2019 ll hold a vote on anything President Donald Trump signals he \u2019 ll support . For his part , Trump has said that background checks are on the table , though he seems to be pushing for something short of universal checks . Manchin and Toomey\u2014as well as Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) , one of the Senate \u2019 s most vocal gun control advocates\u2014have been in conversations with the White House , hoping to get the president to back a compromise measure that would expand background checks for sales at gun shows and online . Negotiations have dragged on for more than a month amid a furious lobbying campaign from the National Rifle Association and its allies .\nThere were multiple factors that doomed Manchin-Toomey in 2013 , including the strength of the gun lobby and the lack of expertise on the issue in Democratic circles . But seven gun control advocates and former Hill staffers involved in negotiations over the measure told me that the laser-like focus on a popular but fairly unambitious background check bill was a strategic mistake . \u201c To this day , I \u2019 m convinced that when we make background checks our first priority , the NRA screams in public and privately lights up cigars , \u201d Glaze says . \u201c We \u2019 ve got this decades-long fight to achieve a 90-percent issue . When we finally beat the NRA on passage , which we will , the NRA will lose nothing , but they will have held off our movement for decades . \u201d\nSandy Hook had all the makings of a political tipping point . After two decades of avoiding gun debates at all costs , Democrats were suddenly energized around the issue . Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) , then the House minority leader , convened weekly conference calls with gun control advocates . Vice President Joe Biden , deputized by President Barack Obama to lead the White House \u2019 s response , convened a group of experts to put together a background checks bill , the movement \u2019 s top priority .\nBut the real deal-making was happening elsewhere . Manchin , a moderate Democrat with an A-rating from the NRA , mobilized his staff to begin drafting legislation . The senator had been devastated by Sandy Hook , recalls Jan Brunner , a former Manchin staffer who worked on the measure . \u201c He was always so pro-NRA , and all of a sudden , he \u2019 s sitting there crying , \u2018 Nobody kills babies\u2014they killed babies , \u2019 \u201d she says .\n\u201c When we make background checks our first priority , the NRA screams in public and privately lights up cigars . \u201d\nManchin \u2019 s staff teamed up with Glaze and staffers for Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) The idea was to craft a background checks bill that could pass the Senate with enough Republican votes to be compelling to the GOP-held House . The effort culminated in a secret meeting in early 2013 between Glaze , John Feinblatt\u2014then a top aide to Michael Bloomberg , now the president of Everytown\u2014and a prominent gun industry lawyer at Manhattan \u2019 s Odeon restaurant . The trio discussed sweeteners that could be added to the bill to win over the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation , which represents the interests of gun sellers and manufacturers .\n\u201c The reason [ the gun industry lawyer ] did this was because the industry was scared shitless , \u201d Glaze recalls . \u201c They thought Sandy Hook was so catastrophic that unless they gave somewhere , they were just done in the eyes of the public. \u201d Glaze hoped that by floating a ban on assault weapons\u2014among the industry \u2019 s most profitable products\u2014advocates could pressure the gun lobby into agreeing to expanded background checks instead .\nThat conversation produced the Manchin-Toomey measure , which was far from comprehensive . It would have required a background check for most commercial sales\u2014including any firearm purchased at a gun show or through a print or online advertisement\u2014but other private sales and transfers would still have been permitted without a background check . It also contained concessions for the industry , such as making it easier to sell and transport certain firearms across state lines . For a time , things looked promising : The NSSF appeared ready to back the bill , as did influential conservative Sen. Tom Coburn ( R-Okla. ) , whose state was home to one of the nation \u2019 s biggest gun shows .\nBut the negotiations with Coburn and the gun lobby wore on for months . Coburn ultimately demanded that the newly instituted background checks not be recorded , a proposal that the bill \u2019 s authors rejected . In the end , Toomey was the only Republican willing to sponsor the bill , and by that point , much of the political pressure created by Sandy Hook had dissipated . \u201c Delay was the NRA \u2019 s friend , and it almost certainly wasn \u2019 t accidental , \u201d Glaze says . \u201c We waited too long , possibly because the NRA dragged us there . \u201d\nAnd because the Manchin-Toomey measure failed , it set the movement up to ask for too little in future negotiations , says Arkadi Gerney , who worked on gun issues at the Center of American Progress at the time . It would have been better , he says , to have voted on a universal background checks bill that didn \u2019 t include a raft of exceptions . \u201c That might have gotten only 48 or 49 votes in the Senate , but it would have been better in hindsight , \u201d he argues .\nIt \u2019 s been more than six weeks since the tragedies in El Paso and Dayton , and it \u2019 s still not clear how committed Trump might be to background checks . But Democratic leaders seem to have internalized at least some of the lessons of 2013 . \u201c We made it clear to the president that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done , \u201d Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement Sunday .\nGerney thinks that \u2019 s a wise strategy\u2014one that O \u2019 Rourke and his rivals have also taken to heart . \u201c The Democrats running for president do not want to pass a weak bill or just a red flag bill , \u201d he says . \u201c They want to keep this issue in the news , take it to the election , win the White House and Senate , blow up the filibuster , and then they can do a universal background checks bill , and assault weapons ban\u2014all of it . \u201d",
