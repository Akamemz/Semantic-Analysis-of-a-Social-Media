Waiting for them is the actress Arianne Zucker of \u201c Days of Our Lives. \u201d On the bus , her hotness has inspired cackles , what sound like high-fives , expletives . Both men have talked about her legs . Trump has already thrown back some Tic Tacs , in case he decides to lunge for a kiss . But when he steps off the bus , Trump greets her with the courtesy of a Boy Scout : \u201c Hello , how are you , hi ! \u201d\n\u201c Hi , Mr. Trump , how are you ? \u201d Zucker says . She is polite ; she is professional .\nIt is a moment of deeply uncomfortable dramatic irony : We , the audience , know something she does not , which is that only moments earlier , Trump was coldly appraising her body parts . Bush , acting as a two-bit pimp , asks Zucker to hug Trump , and then asks for a hug himself . Her small laugh is as fake as Trump \u2019 s politeness ; it is all excruciating to watch . Then the three of them , now performing , waltz off together . Zucker is game to play along when Bush presses her to answer which of the two men she would pick . \u201c Both ! \u201d she finally says .\nMaybe Zucker thinks that she is in on the joke . But really , we know , the power is all theirs . It is not just that the two men have erased her as a person , during their conversation on the bus ; it is that they share the knowledge that they have done so , silently , collectively , which amplifies their power over her . It is all unspoken , a clubby secret , a male form of control based on exclusion .\nBush and Trump on that bus are , in so many ways , the apotheosis of what so many of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s supporters are ready to overturn : the musty sleaziness that went out of style in the 1970s ; the old bosses who want their secretaries pretty ; the cigar-chomping power brokers who think sexual harassment is the woman \u2019 s problem ; the drooling dimwits who have gotten further than they should have on connections and male privilege . The bus is the old boys \u2019 club that women rarely get to see inside \u2014 but it may also turn out to be the wrecking ball that takes down the club for good .",
