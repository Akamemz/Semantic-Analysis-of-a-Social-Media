You may recall that this was the briefing at which he showed a strange campaign-style video featuring compliments from Democratic officials , which had clearly been inspired by a very similar compilation shown the night before on Sean Hannity 's Fox News show , already a de facto Trump celebration hour .\nIt was also the appearance in which he repeatedly made the claim that he had `` total authority '' to reopen the government and blathered on about how he 'd saved hundreds of thousands of lives when he supposedly `` closed '' the country in the first place .\nKaitlan Collins of CNN asked him a question I think we all were wondering at that point :\nYou said , `` When someone is president of the United States , their authority is total . '' That is not true . Who \u2014 who told you that ?\nTrump did n't answer . The next day Trump announced that it would be up to the governors to decide when they wanted to open up . ( He said he would `` authorize '' them to do it , even though they do n't need any such authorization . ) Various media outlets have reported that he was convinced to do this because it would be better for his electoral prospects if he can blame the governors for whatever goes wrong with the reopening .\nTrump has often touted his alleged total authority , saying on one famous occasion that Article II of the Constitution gives him `` the right to do whatever I want as president . '' But when Collins asked him that question I was pretty sure I knew who told him that . The most powerful legal authority in the administration who believes that the president has almost unlimited power is Attorney General William Barr .\nBarr made an appearance on Laura Ingraham 's show not long ago \u2014 I wrote about it here \u2014 and made some comments at the time which give us a clue about how he sees the president 's authority in this circumstance . Ingraham went on a tear about forcing churches to close during the pandemic and Barr correctly pointed out that unless the state was singling out religious institutions for closure while allowing other large gatherings , the First Amendment had not been violated .\nWhat came next in that conversation reveals Barr 's real agenda , however , and possibly that of all the other schemers in the administration . At the time of the interview , the first rumblings from the astroturf groups in various swing states with Democratic governors were starting to be heard . Barr was on it already :\nI think we have to be very careful to make sure this is \u2014 you know , that the draconian measures that are being adopted are fully justified , and there are not alternative ways of protecting people . And I think , you know , when this \u2014 when this period of time is \u2014 at the end of April expires , I think we have to allow people to adapt more than we have and not just tell people to go home and hide under the bed , but allow them to use other ways \u2014 social distancing and other means \u2014 to protect themselves .\nSince then we 've had heavily-covered small protests like this around the country demanding that governors rescind their stay-at-home orders :\nOn Tuesday , Barr appeared on Hugh Hewitt 's show and made clear that if anyone thought the top law enforcement officer in the country might find armed protests against public health measures to be a threat to public order , they needed to think again . He reiterated his belief that the states have imposed unnecessary and draconian measures and implicitly backed the protests , calling stay-at-home orders `` disturbingly close to house arrest . ''\nThe legal issues he believes are salient are civil liberties and something vague to do with interstate commerce .

Either that , or he anticipates that there really will be checkpoints on the highways as infected people from Trump states decide to descend upon others . In any case , he announced that the federal government will join individual lawsuits to force states to open , whatever the task force guidelines endorsed by Vice President Pence may say .\nAccording to the Detroit News , Barr has the support of the man who was widely considered the worst attorney general of recent history , Reagan administration stalwart Ed Meese . Apparently , Meese and some other right-wing extremists wrote to Barr earlier this week , accusing the states of `` rampant abuses of constitutional rights and civil liberties '' and exhorting him `` to undertake an immediate review of all the orders that have been issued by the states and local governments across the nation .
