    "content": "After Saudi operatives brutally murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Kingdom \u2019 s consulate in Istanbul in October , the Senate is rightly reviewing U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia , including debating U.S. involvement with the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen conflict . Not enough attention , however , is being given to Iran \u2019 s direct responsibility for the suffering , violence and tragedy in Yemen .\nThe humanitarian crisis in Yemen is staggering . The ongoing conflict between the Saudi-supported , internationally-recognized government in Yemen , and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels , reportedly has claimed over 57,000 lives , driven half of Yemen \u2019 s 28 million people to the cusp of famine , and displaced 2.3 million Yemenis from their homes .\nThe U.S. has powerful interests not only in ending Yemen \u2019 s humanitarian crisis , but also in stopping Iran and its Shi \u2019 a terrorist proxies , as well as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , ISIS-Yemen , and other Sunni terrorists , from establishing permanent footholds from which they can threaten our nation and our forces in the region .\nIn Yemen , as in Syria , Iran is ruthlessly pursuing malign hegemony with no regard for innocent lives . The Iranian regime is using arms transfers , training and terrorist proxies to empower Houthi rebels , terrorize Yemeni civilians , undermine the security of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , and challenge U.S. national security interests in the region .\nHouthi rebels have used Iranian-supplied advanced arms in the Yemen conflict , indiscriminately launching over 100 ballistic missiles against Saudi cities , unleashing explosive unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) against Saudi civilian targets , and deploying explosive boats and anti-ship missiles against commercial ships in the Arabian Gulf .\nMoreover , Iran-backed Houthi rebels have detained thousands of Yemenis and reportedly subjected many of them to \u201c extreme torture \u2013 being smashed in their faces with batons , hung from chains by their wrists or genitals for weeks at a time , and scorched with acid . \u201d\nIran \u2019 s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah terrorists have provided training and support that have greatly increased the lethality and combat effectiveness of Houthi rebels , and enhanced their ability to threaten Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , international shipping in the Gulf , and U.S. forces in the region . Even if Iranian weapons are somehow cut off , the Houthi rebels \u2019 combat-experience and training will persist for decades .\nWhile the United States is right to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for Khashoggi \u2019 s barbaric murder , we must also squarely face Iran \u2019 s central role in perpetuating Yemen \u2019 s conflict .
