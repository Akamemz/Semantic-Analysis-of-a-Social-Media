campaign, said Wednesday that his office did not charge Trump with a crime because it \u201cwas not an option\u201d under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations.\n\nMueller, in a dramatic appearance at DOJ headquarters, said it would have been impossible to bring Trump to court and that his final report clearly spelled out that investigators did not conclude that the president was innocent of a crime.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAfter that investigation, if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,\u201d Mueller said during his eight-minute address.\n\nMueller\u2019s statement, which he said he hopes and expects be his last public remarks on the report, is likely to amp up pressure on Democrats in Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t mention impeachment directly, Mueller said the Constitution requires a \"process other than the criminal justice system\" to take disciplinary action against a sitting president.\n\nSome

an impeachment inquiry against Trump, after Mueller laid out evidence of possible obstruction of justice by the president in his report.\n\nBut Pelosi and other top House Democrats have shied away from starting such proceedings, pointing to recent victories in court over Trump in their ongoing investigations as reason that impeachment isn\u2019t necessary at this time.\n\nReading carefully from his prepared statement, Mueller said Wednesday that the DOJ guidance, in the form of an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel, \"explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting president because it\u2019s important to preserve evidence when memories are fresh and documents are available.\"\n\nAnd he noted that the opinion would have prohibited him from filing a charge under seal that could be

crime.\n\nTrump and his allies have pointed to Mueller not bringing forward an obstruction charge as evidence of the president\u2019s innocence, even as Mueller has made clear that his report did not exonerate Trump.\n\nThe president highlighted that point in a tweet sent shortly after Mueller\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThere was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our country, a person is innocent,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe case is closed!\u201d\n\nBut other Democrats aren\u2019t buying that argument.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis
