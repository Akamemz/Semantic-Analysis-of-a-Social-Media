He wants the reduction or elimination of barriers to United States investment abroad , while domestic restrictions on foreign investment \u2014 in shipping , for example , and many other areas ostensibly related to national security \u2014 naturally remain untouched .\nMr. Trump does pay lip service to upholding labor and environmental standards , which were shifted to side agreements in the original Nafta negotiations . But he has little interest in domestic policies that would really help those hurt by trade .\nA truly fairer globalization would start at home , with a reconstruction of the social compact that binds the corporate elite and the wealthy to labor and the middle class . Every society that opens itself up to the world economy needs social transfers , labor-training programs and regional policies that take care of the adversely affected workers and communities . Our domestic approach , over-reliant on underfunded and ineffective trade-adjustment assistance policies , has not worked and needs to be replaced by more extensive safety nets .\nThese must be complemented with more progressive income taxation , employment-generating policies such as infrastructure investment and political reforms that reduce the role of money in politics . Mr. Trump and the Republicans want to take us in exactly the opposite direction , with a tax reform that will benefit the wealthy first and foremost .\nThe problem with Mr. Trump \u2019 s economic nationalism is not his avowed belief that trade should serve the national interest . When we economists teach the theory of trade , we emphasize that free trade is desirable because it expands the domestic economic pie \u2014 not because it confers gains to other nations . The problem is that he is deeply averse to the domestic policies that would allow American workers a piece of the added pie .\nInternational fairness in turn would require us to recognize that all countries have legitimate reasons to value their national sovereignty . Rules for finance or intellectual property that , for good or ill , prevail in the United States will frequently be unsuited to other countries .
