    "content": "Iraq is burning again \u2014 and the unrest could plunge the country once more into full-blown chaos .\nIn the past 48 hours , protesters in the southern Iraqi city of Basra have attacked or set fire to nearly every government building \u2014 including the headquarters of the ruling Da \u2019 wa Party and the offices of the state-run Iraqiya TV station \u2014 as well as the Iranian consulate and the headquarters of almost every Iranian-backed militia in the city .\nAnd on Friday evening , according to local reports , protesters had gathered outside the US consulate in an attempt to storm the building , and Iraqi security forces had been deployed to keep them away . ( The consulate was closed at the time . )\nThe protesters are outraged over the lack of basic services in the city . Basra has been suffering from a crippling electricity shortage for months \u2014 in a place where summer temperatures regularly reach above 120 degrees Fahrenheit during the day .\nCompounding that is a water pollution crisis that has sickened thousands of residents of Basra province in the past few weeks \u2014 including 7,000 cases that occurred over just two days in late August . According to the Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights , hospitals were so overwhelmed that some patients were left lying on the floor untreated .\nBut while those may be the most immediate causes of the unrest , experts say the demonstrations are about a lot more than just water and electricity : Protesters are also lashing out at the rampant government corruption and Iranian meddling they believe have contributed to the dire economic situation in the oil-rich city .\nIraqi security forces have imposed curfews but have so far been unable to contain the spread of the rioting . At least 12 demonstrators have been killed and dozens injured , mostly in clashes with security forces , since the protests began five days ago , further adding fuel to the protesters \u2019 fire .\nThe crisis is also threatening to sink the country back into the kind of chaos in which terrorist groups like ISIS thrive . Here \u2019 s what \u2019 s going on .\nSeated near the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and crisscrossed by a network of waterways that once earned it the nickname \u201c the Venice of the East , \u201d Basra should be a lush , flourishing paradise with abundant access to fresh water .\nBut for months , Basra residents have turned on their water taps to find cloudy , brownish-yellow water flowing out that is too salty and polluted to be used for washing clothes .\nWhat locals in Basra had coming through their public water service this morning , Tanoma district , Basra , southern Iraq . One of the richest oil cities in the world lacks fresh water . pic.twitter.com/xxApgoPP9f \u2014 Steven nabil ( @ thestevennabil ) September 5 , 2018\nOne YouTube video from Basra showed thick black sludge gushing out of a garden hose :\nBasra \u2019 s once-pristine freshwater canals are clogged with garbage and sewage . A combination of a lack of rainfall and the construction of upstream dams in Turkey , Syria , and Iran , in addition to poor water management by the government , has allowed saltwater from the Persian Gulf to leak in , destroying farmland and killing fish and livestock .\nOfficial Iraqi government statistics put the chemical contamination of Basra \u2019 s water at 100 percent , and the bacterial pollution at 50 percent .\nIraqi health officials estimate that more than 17,000 residents of Basra province have been poisoned by the polluted drinking water in recent weeks \u2014 including 7,000 cases in two days in late August .\nThis all comes amid an electricity shortage and a broader economic crisis . The oil-rich port city is home to 70 percent of the country \u2019 s oil reserves , yet 50 percent of its residents live below the poverty line . Unemployment is high , particularly among young people .\nGovernment ministries in Iraq are controlled by the various political parties in parliament , and they \u2019 re assigned based on the number of seats each party holds .\nAs a result , the parties treat the ministries they control as their personal sources of profit , awarding powerful jobs and lucrative contracts to their political cronies \u2014 instead of to qualified technocrats who actually know what they \u2019 re doing .\nThis , perhaps not surprisingly , isn \u2019 t exactly the best way to create competent government ministries that can deliver services effectively .\nFor instance , AFP reports that a \u201c substantial slice of the estimated $ 40 billion allocated to the [ country \u2019 s ] power sector over the past 15 years has vanished . Money from public tenders has allegedly lined the pockets of corrupt politicians and businessmen who fronted fake contracts . \u201d\nAnd that \u2019 s just one sector . Now imagine that level of dysfunction spread across the entire government bureaucracy and you \u2019 ll begin to understand why providing even basic services like electricity and water can be difficult if not impossible .\nOn top of that , Basra and the rest of southern Iraq have historically been ignored and underdeveloped by the government .\n\u201c Basra has been on the receiving end of a ton of bad government mismanagement , at pretty much every level , \u201d Phillip Smyth , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , told me .\nNow it seems the people of Basra have had enough . And they \u2019 re making their frustration known to just about everyone they can find .\n\u201c Protesters are basically taking a shotgun approach : We \u2019 re angry , screw it all , we \u2019 re going after everyone \u201d\nExperts say the protests are also about the deeper , systemic issues in Iraq : corruption , Iranian influence , and the political and security challenges facing the country now that the main coordinated military effort against ISIS has mostly ended .\nMany people in Basra blame Iran for supporting corrupt Iraqi officials and the Shia militias headquartered in the city , which are thriving while the majority of the people continue to struggle with poverty and unemployment .\nOn Friday , protesters stormed Iran \u2019 s consulate in Basra , tearing down the Iranian flag and putting up an Iraqi flag in its place . They also burned Iranian flags and pictures of Iran \u2019 s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the streets , while chanting , \u201c Iran out , out ! \u201d\nProtesters have also torched the headquarters of nearly every Iran-backed Shia militia group in the city , including Asa \u2019 ib Ahl al-Haq , the Badr Organization , Kata \u2019 ib al-Imam Ali , and others .\nAll major governmental buildings set on fire by protesters in # Iraq 's Basra ; protesters have also set fire on offices of Badr , Asai ' b Ahl al-Hak , Nujaba ' a , Dawa party , state of law office , Hizbollah & other political party offices . pic.twitter.com/irZTU67pKr \u2014 Abdulla Hawez ( @ abdullahawez ) September 6 , 2018\n\u201c If anyone needs more proof that Iran isn \u2019 t always everyone \u2019 s favorite neighbor , here you have it , \u201d Rasha Al Aqeedi , a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who specializes in Iraqi politics , tweeted . \u201c Nonetheless this is a serious escalation with dire consequences . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s not just Iran .
