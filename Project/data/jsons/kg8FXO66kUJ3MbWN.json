With a tough slate of Senate races looming in 2016 and Republicans desperate to take back the White House , he has a strong incentive to show the GOP can govern .\nBut two months into the Republican majority , the new Senate looks an awful lot like the old Senate .\nThe chamber ca n't even come together to pass a bill tackling the scourge of sex trafficking -- which has wide bipartisan support -- because it has become derailed in a partisan fight over abortion . The result is that President Barack Obama 's nominee for attorney general , Loretta Lynch , is being held up . If things were not bad enough , Lynch 's confirmation process has degenerated into an ugly row over race .\n`` If we can not approve a bill to deal with human trafficking , then what will we be able to deal with ? '' Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said this week . `` We have to get past the tendency to score partisan political points that has affected too many bills on both sides of the aisle . ''\nThe new Senate is not yet breaking its bad productivity streak .\nThe only high profile legislation sent to Obama 's desk was a bill authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline , which the president swiftly vetoed .\nJUST WATCHED McConnell delays Attorney General vote Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McConnell delays Attorney General vote 01:52\nThe Republican establishment in the House and Senate has spent much of its time having to quell a bid by grassroots conservatives to defund the Department of Homeland Security as a way to punish what they see as Obama 's `` executive amnesty '' in reshaping immigration laws .\nThe GOP-led Senate and House are also at odds over exactly what to include in the biggest piece of looming business the party majorities will face -- a budget bill .\nThis is all welcome news for Obama , who was dealt a humiliating defeat in November 's mid-terms but is not facing much pressure from Congress at all . He 's using the political vacuum as a respite from the misery lame-duck presidents usually expect in their twilight years .\nThe raging Republican civil war , meanwhile , is making McConnell 's task in managing his restive conference almost as difficult as the one John Boehner has slogged through in recent years .\nAnd Boehner , unlike McConnell , does not have to deal with at least three Republicans -- Ted Cruz , Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham -- who are flirting with running for president , and who may have personal , rather than party motivations at stake .\n`` The election changed majority control -- it did n't change the sharp differences between the two parties , '' said Steven Smith , a specialist in Congress at Washington University , St. Louis . `` It did n't change McConnell 's relationship with his own colleagues . ''\nStill , McConnell 's defenders say that he has managed to make at least peripheral changes to Senate life . He has allowed more amendments to legislation than was typically allowed under the former Democratic majority rule of Harry Reid , letting lawmakers feel their voices are heard .\nIn the DHS battle , McConnell honored his vow not to allow a government shutdown , though that promise will be tested in government funding and debt ceiling fights later this year .\nAnd even in the best of times , nothing moves in the Senate at anything other than glacial pace . So McConnell 's quest to restore `` regular order '' might be the political equivalent of turning around an oil tanker .\nProspects look reasonable that by using a budget device known as `` reconciliation , '' which can bypass the Senate filibuster , the GOP will be able to move some legislation through Congress and evade Democratic obstruction .\nBut many Republicans believe that Democrats , by suddenly objecting to the abortion provision after it sailed through committee , are simply looking for a way to jam up the Senate in the belief Republicans will get the blame for the futility . Their current strategy is , in effect , a 2016 strategy .\nWith the chamber 's filibuster rules , which require a 60 vote majority on most significant legislation , the current Republican high water mark of 54 seats is not sufficient to dictate terms to the opposition party .\nAlready , with an apparent eye on 2016 , senior Democrats are making the case that Republicans simply ca n't get things done .\n`` Republicans have came in saying they would know how to govern , and what a mess they 've made of it , '' said veteran Democratic Sen Chuck Schumer of New York . `` They did n't have a good time or good luck on the pipeline bill , where they got bollocksed up on climate change . They 've held us for four weeks on funding Homeland Security . And now even a simple trafficking bill they ca n't get done . ''\nHe added : `` Hello , our Republican friends , you 're in the majority . They still think they 're in the minority and they 're putting their own poison pills in their own bill . ''\nThe shenanigans have some veteran observers of the Senate already beginning to downgrade expectations for the next few years .\n`` What 's clear is that the quick cement is rapidly drying on how the new Senate is going to operate , '' said Ron Bonjean , a former top Republican strategist in the Senate and the House .\nBonjean predicted a return to the grueling `` trench warfare '' which has made the Senate one of the most trying places to be in Washington .\n`` Democrats do n't want to move anything . They are finding reasons not to join Republicans in moving legislation because that will help the majority succeed politically , '' said Bonjean .\nThe row over the trafficking bill is a bad omen for those who want to see a return to comity in the Senate . An attempt at a compromise failed on Thursday so the controversy will rumble on at least until next week .\nAnd the clash has become much more than a dispute over an obscure bill . It 's a test case of how the Senate will be run for the next two years , being waved by two veteran experts of gridlock and procedure , McConnell and Reid who have seen their relationship deteriorate badly in recent years .\nMcConnell is refusing to bring up Lynch 's nomination , which has the support of a number of Republicans as well as Democrats , until the trafficking bill passes .\nBut in the end , some conservatives believe , the Democrats will have little option to climb down , because the White House badly wants Lynch to get confirmed to succeed Eric Holder .\nBut by then , it may be too late to stop ill feelings over the nomination from poisoning whatever goodwill is left in the Senate , setting a bad precedent for the rest of the year .\nFor example , Sen. John McCain on Thursday furiously condemned another Senate veteran , Dick Durbin , a Democrat from Illinois , after he accused Republicans of treating Lynch , who is African American , like civil rights icon Rosa Parks by moving her `` to the back of the bus . ''\nMcConnell does n't just have problems with Democrats though . He increasingly is struggling to keep his own caucus in line , especially among lawmakers who have ridden the Tea Party wave and are challenging the Republican establishment in the Senate .\nIn one eye-opening example , Republican freshman Sen. Tom Cotton bypassed Senate leadership by getting together a letter signed by 46 other GOP senators to warn Iran directly that Congress could torpedo a nuclear deal between world powers , including Washington , and the Islamic Republic .\nGrass roots conservatives are also furious that Boehner and McConnell combined to derail a bid by conservatives to withhold funding for the DHS in protest at Obama 's unilateral effort to save millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation .\n`` They organized a surrender . it was the surrender brigade , '' said Ken Cuccinelli , President of the Senate Conservatives Fund , a political action committee devoted to sending candidates supported by the grassroots to the Senate . McConnell `` misled Kentucky voters . He said he was going to stand up to Obama 's liberal agenda . He said he was going to use the power of the purse . he said he was going to repeal Obamacare root and branch . ''\nCuccinelli , the former Attorney General of Virginia , predicted that the action of the Senate Republican establishment would not be accepted by Republican activists and could fuel primary campaigns against sitting senators up for re-election , including McCain , Ohio Sen . Rob Portman , and North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr .\nSo under simultaneous attack from the right and the left , and with the president ready with his veto , McConnell is going to have to negotiate an increasingly narrow path before he can send his troops into the field in the 2016 election and argue that , unlike Democrats , the GOP actually got something done .",
