A number of leading public health authorities , universities , and NGOs around the world have been doing important work to develop opt-in contact tracing technology . To further this cause , Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces ( APIs ) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing .

First , in May , both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities . These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores . Second , in the coming months , Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms . This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate , if they choose to opt in , as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities .
