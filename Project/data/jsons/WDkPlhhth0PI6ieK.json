Officials from Russia , Ukraine and the United States appeared on the political talk shows to spin their narrative of events on the ground in the eastern European country embroiled in turmoil .\nIf you spent the Easter holiday doing something other than watching the Sunday political talk shows but want to get up to speed on this Monday morning for the week ahead , we \u2019 ve got you covered with this comprehensive take on all-things politics .\nUkraine : Russian troops are still massing on Ukraine \u2019 s eastern border , and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Ukraine is on the brink of civil war . Key players in the crisis weighed in on the political talk shows .\nThe United States Ambassador to Ukraine , Geoffrey Pyatt , sounded optimistic after a series of meetings with Ukrainian , Russian and European officials Sunday .\n@ CNNsotu post 's my interview today from St.Michael 's on a beautiful spring day . http : //t.co/KZidBbt0JM \u2014 Geoffrey Pyatt ( @ GeoffPyatt ) April 20 , 2014\n\u201c I think we all reaffirmed today in this setting our collective commitment to trying to make the Geneva framework a success , \u201d Pyatt said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union , \u201d referring to the international document that aims to ease tensions in Ukraine .\nWhile he said there are \u201c some real challenges , \u201d including fresh violence in the town of Slavyansk , Pyatt believes that there has been \u201c some progress. \u201d He points to reports that one of the government buildings in Ukraine that had been taken over by pro-Russian militants is once again flying a Ukrainian flag .\nBut the Ukrainian Prime Minister sounded more panicked . On NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d Arseniy Yatsenyuk said \u201c it \u2019 s crystal clear \u201d that Russia is a threat to entire world and Ukraine .\nYatsenyuk said Russia \u2019 s security forces and \u201c former KGB agents \u201d operating in Ukraine make up the \u201c so-called peaceful protestors \u201d and are causing violence and divisiveness .\nPro-Russian separatists in Ukraine ignore new Geneva pact aimed at easing tensions\nHe said that if Russia pulls back , \u201c this would definitely calm down the situation and stabilize the situation in Eastern Ukraine . \u201d\nBut on \u201c Fox News Sunday , \u201d Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak said , \u201c The whole message of the Geneva document , as far as I 'm concerned , is that the Ukrainians need to resolve these issues themselves . \u201d\nHe added that if the pro-Russian groups are to lay down their arms , then all groups , including pro-Ukrainian groups , must do so as well .\nPyatt seemed to downplay Russia \u2019 s role in eastern Ukraine , saying that international monitors blame \u201c small , isolated groups \u201d for the violence .\n\u201c There is an apparent effort from outside to try to stir division , as you say . But I 'm convinced that those who are trying to stimulate separatism , who are preaching violence , are not going to find resonance , because that 's not what I hear from the people of Ukraine in terms of what they want , \u201d Pyatt said .\nAs for the disturbing reports of identifying Jewish people in eastern Ukraine , Yatsenyuk said he told the Ukrainian military and appropriate agencies to \u201c urgently \u2026 find these bastards and to bring them to justice . \u201d\nKislyak denied that Russia has anything to do with the anti-Jewish action , calling the accusations \u201c an outrageous provocation . \u201d\n\u201c We certainly condemn any manifestations of anti-Semitism , \u201d he said on Fox .\nWhile the United States has refused to commit military aid to Ukraine , whose military is depleted , Pyatt said that \u201c there is no military solution \u201d and that the crisis must be solved diplomatically .\nBut the Ukrainian Prime Minister said their military needs help . \u201c We need to have and to get the real support from our Western partners . \u201d\nSens . Bob Corker , R-Tennessee , and Chris Murphy , D-Connecticut , said that the United States should sanction Russian energy companies and banks , a step that hasn \u2019 t been taken because of the economic impact on the United States and Europe .\nThe Russian ambassador denounced the sanctions and flipped the Cold War accusation back on the United States , saying the sanctions are a \u201c significant gesture of the cold world mentality. \u201d Some analysts have said Putin \u2019 s aggressions signify his desire to reinstate a Cold War .\nPolitics of 2014 : The Republicans continue to insist the 2014 midterm elections are all about the Affordable Care Act .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that Obamacare is still the No . 1 , No . 2 and No . 3 issue going into this election , \u201d Sean Spicer , communications director of the Republican National Committee said , on \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nIn the 36 Senate seats up for election this year , Democrats are defending 21 of them . Republicans are running close races in several of those states , including North Carolina , Louisiana , Arkansas , Michigan and Alaska .\nAnd Obamacare is the reason Republicans are \u201c expanding the map \u201d to about a dozen races , including races that Democrats say are safely in their hands .\nPredictably , Spicer \u2019 s counterpart at the Democratic National Committee , Mo Elleithee , laughed .\n\u201c The only thing more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is taking it away , \u201d Elleithee said .\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , chairwoman of the DNC , echoed Elleithee .\n\u201c The President is right : We have a law that is working , \u201d she said on \u201c Meet the Press . \u201d\nBut Wasserman Schultz , of Florida , admitted that some Democrats , including Louisiana \u2019 s Mary Landrieu , Arkansas \u2019 Mark Pryor and Alaska \u2019 s Mark Begich have to run away from the unpopular President this election cycle .\n\u201c What 's the case is that each of these candidates have to run their own race . They have to talk about and focus on the issues that are important to their constituents , \u201d she said .\nIndependent pollster Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report said , \u201c It \u2019 s hard for me to believe that Republicans can run from now until November just on ACA . \u201d\n# Midterms : Who will win the battle for the Senate ? http : //t.co/zIhwU1KMnv \u2014 State of the Union ( @ CNNsotu ) April 20 , 2014\n\u201c I think the cake has been baked on ACA , \u201d he added .\nThe three \u201c State of the Union \u201d guests made their 2014 predictions :\nSpicer : Republicans are competitive in New Hampshire , Oregon , Minnesota and Virginia , which are now part of the Republican \u2019 s expanded map .\nElleithee : Democrats win Kentucky and Georgia .

There are tactical units strategically placed at different points along the route . There are a number of undercover people and assets that will be deployed , \u201d he said on \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d\n\u201c We also do n't want to have it kind of a race through a militarized zone , \u201d he added .\nVeteran Suicide : The issue of veteran suicide is a quiet but persistent problem , with 22 vets committing suicide each day . The only Iraq War veteran serving in the Senate , John Walsh , D-Montana , is attempting to address the issue .\nWhen asked by \u201c State of the Union \u201d host Candy Crowley if the government is fulfilling its promises to veterans , Walsh said , \u201c I do not . \u201d\n\u201c I think we do \u2026 a very good job of taking that citizen soldier and making a warrior out of him , but we are n't doing a very good job of taking that warrior and reintegrating him back into society , \u201d he said .\nWalsh \u2019 s Suicide Prevention Act for American Veterans attempts to address mental health by , among other things , providing care for veterans for 15 years instead of five .\nThe cost of the bill is not yet known but will likely be expensive .
