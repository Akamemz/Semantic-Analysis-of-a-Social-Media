    "content": "He only controls 46 seats , but Harry Reid is acting like he has 60 .\nReid \u2019 s uncompromising posture during the flap over homeland security funding and his emerging plans for an upcoming fight over immigration make clear he \u2019 s doing little to change the hardball style that defined his tenure as majority leader . This despite losing control of the chamber after last fall \u2019 s Democratic debacle and tamping down a coup among centrists seeking his ouster .\nThe 75-year-old Reid , who may seek reelection next year and is in his second stint as minority leader , is betting that Republicans are so nervous about being blamed for a crisis in Washington \u2014 as they have been repeatedly before \u2014 that they will capitulate again .\nThe new Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell , wanted to initiate a lengthy floor debate on a House-passed Department of Homeland Security funding bill . But Reid surprised Republicans by rallying his caucus on four separate occasions to block the measure from even coming forward \u2014 demanding McConnell drop contentious immigration provisions . After a month of inaction in the Senate and up against Friday \u2019 s funding deadline , McConnell ultimately bent to Reid \u2019 s demands .\nAs House Republicans have called for formal negotiations on the Senate \u2019 s \u201c clean \u201d DHS funding bill , Reid has sent a blunt message across the Capitol : Take it or leave it . Most believe the House will ultimately take it .\nThat \u2019 s not all : As McConnell is pushing for a new plan to thwart Obama \u2019 s executive actions on immigration , Reid and his leadership team are warning they will prevent the matter from even coming to a debate before Congress funds the DHS . And even after Reid eventually agrees to debate the Republican plan on immigration , Democratic leaders are plotting a series of politically charged amendments that could put vulnerable Republicans and potential presidential candidates in tough spots . They will then try to filibuster the Republican bill to death .\n\u201c He is controlling the agenda , \u201d Sen. Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) said of Reid . \u201c And he probably will control the agenda if we don \u2019 t change the rules . \u201d\nReid \u2019 s positioning underscores the painful reality Republicans face as they assume control of both houses of Congress : The position of Senate minority leader is one of the most powerful in the Capitol . Reid can delay and disrupt even the most carefully laid plans by the majority party , which needs 60 votes to break a filibuster . And nowhere has that been more clear than with the DHS funding battle , which has turned House Republicans against Senate GOP leaders , largely over their inability to win over any Democrats to break a filibuster .\nBy relying on the same kind of stall tactics he has long accused GOP leaders of abusing when they were in the minority , Reid is gambling that voters won \u2019 t punish his party for obstructing business .\nIn an interview Thursday , Reid insisted that his approach is much different than the way McConnell ran the Senate minority after President Barack Obama took office in 2009 .\n\u201c We have been very good this Congress , \u201d Reid , wearing glasses shielding a badly injured right eye , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c When things come along we like , we pass them . The problem we had the last six years is they didn \u2019 t like anything , so they opposed everything . We don \u2019 t . \u201d\nSo far , Reid \u2019 s positioning appears to be helping him with his internal caucus politics \u2014 similar to McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner in their respective caucuses . McConnell is eager to avoid a DHS shutdown that could be potentially damaging to his 24 GOP senators up for reelection , while Boehner is taking a hard line pleasing House conservatives . And Democrats are trying to strike the right balance between confrontation and conciliation \u2014 while unifying on procedural votes in an attempt to divide Republicans against themselves .\nReid \u2019 s tactics , as Washington Sen. Patty Murray told Democratic senators at a private party retreat in Baltimore last month , could be summed up like this : \u201c It \u2019 s fine to work with [ Republicans ] , but don \u2019 t be a cheap date . \u201d\nReid most certainly isn \u2019 t . As part of his demands to keep the DHS funded past Friday , Reid and his caucus called on Senate Republicans to drop House-approved provisions , which would block Obama \u2019 s 2012 and 2014 executive actions deferring deportations and providing work permits for roughly 5 million illegal immigrants . Facing a recalcitrant Democratic Caucus and fearful of a DHS shutdown during a time of war , McConnell acquiesced .\nTo continue pushing against Obama \u2019 s immigration policies , McConnell is trying to begin debate on a plan by Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) to prohibit funding for the immigration policies Obama announced after the November elections . McConnell \u2019 s leadership team was trying to court enough Democrats to open debate on the Collins plan before the DHS funding fight is resolved .\nBut Reid \u2019 s argument appears to be winning the day . Moderates like Sens . Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) , Angus King ( I-Maine ) and Jon Tester ( D-Mont . ) say the department must be fully funded before they \u2019 d entertain the Collins plan . More significantly , Reid appears to have the votes to prevent the Collins proposal from breaking a filibuster at the end of legislative debate .\nMcCaskill , who had previously expressed unease about Obama \u2019 s administrative actions , said of the Collins plan : \u201c I \u2019 m in favor of amending it . I \u2019 m in favor of trying to get comprehensive reform . I \u2019 m not saying I \u2019 m in favor of her legislation . \u201d\nAnd Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-N.H. ) , who during her reelection battle last fall criticized talk of Obama moving administratively on immigration , said she had \u201c serious reservations \u201d about the Collins plan .\n\u201c What I said on the campaign was that I had a concern about the president and the timing of his executive order , \u201d Shaheen said . \u201c And that has to do with my belief \u2014 and I \u2019 ve said this to the president \u2014 Congress should have the opportunity to address immigration in the new Congress . \u201d\nDemocratic leaders are weighing a series of hot-button amendments \u2014 ranging from proposing the Senate \u2019 s comprehensive immigration bill from the last Congress to the so-called Dream Act to provide a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants \u2014 partly to bolster their efforts to court Latino voters and put Republicans in a tough spot .\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio , a Republican who co-authored the comprehensive immigration bill and now is likely running for the GOP presidential nomination , said he would vote against the same plan if Democrats propose it as an amendment to the Collins proposal .\n\u201c No , they are wasting their time if they do that , \u201d Rubio said when asked if he would vote for the comprehensive bill as an amendment this year . \u201c They are just further antagonizing everyone . We need to get to something that can pass . We already tried that , it didn \u2019 t work . \u201d\nSimilarly , Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk , a vulnerable Republican facing reelection next year , threw cold water on attaching a comprehensive plan to the Collins proposal \u2014 potentially opening him up to attacks that he \u2019 s reversing his position on immigration . Kirk took a shot at Reid \u2019 s tactics .\n\u201c The schedule is controlled by the majority leader . That means some Democrats who have forgotten they lost the last election don \u2019 t have the schedule anymore , \u201d Kirk said . \u201c Imagine just how emotionally hard it is for them to understand they got slaughtered in the last election . I have noticed that people forget that Harry got fired by the American people . \u201d\nSome red-state centrists were squeamish when asked if they would back Reid \u2019 s tactics . Two other centrists who could face tough reelection battles in 2018 , Sens . Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana , declined to say if they will back Reid \u2019 s strategy on immigration . After Heitkamp refused three times to answer a reporter \u2019 s questions , an aide said she is still \u201c reviewing \u201d the Collins bill .\n\u201c Just give the office a call . We \u2019 ll get back to you , \u201d Donnelly said . A spokesperson did not respond to multiple messages .\nStill , at times , Reid seems to recognize when he overreaches . On Tuesday , when McConnell bent to Democrats \u2019 will and promised to move the clean DHS funding bill they \u2019 d demanded for weeks , Reid vowed to oppose that effort until getting an assurance that Boehner would put it to a vote in his chamber .
