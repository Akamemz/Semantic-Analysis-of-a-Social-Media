By moving unilaterally , the thinking goes in Washington , Democrats will get credit from Latinos for securing legal status for millions , all while goading the GOP into a potentially fatal reaction on the issue that has danced on racial , class , and political divides for decades .\n\u201c I \u2019 d say \u2018 advantage Obama \u2019 on the politics of this , \u201d said Frank Sharry , executive director of America \u2019 s Voice , a pro-reform group . \u201c He \u2019 s going to recover lost ground in the Latino community for himself and for Democrats . This is a big , bold move that \u2019 s going to protect millions of people . \u201d\nWhile Democrats get the credit , Sharry predicted , the danger for Republicans comes if the opposition of the party \u2019 s most strident members , like Sens .
