Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner came when Trump said that Clinton was `` so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission . ''\nThe jeers continued when Trump referenced the Clinton campaign emails leaked by Wikileaks and claimed that the former secretary of state was `` pretending not to hate Catholics , '' an apparent reference to 2011 emails from a current Clinton campaign spokeswoman that mocked Catholics and evangelical Christians .\nSome members of the audience appeared to be shouting at Timothy Cardinal Dolan , who was sitting between the candidates , and asking him to take the microphone from Trump , who quickly pivoted to remembrances of attending the event with his father .\nMoments earlier , Trump had gotten one of the biggest cheers of the night when he joked about his wife Melania 's speech at the Republican National Convention , which was found to have been partially plagiarized from an address by first lady Michelle Obama .\n`` Michelle Obama gives a speech and everyone loves it , '' Trump said . `` My wife Melania gives the exact same speech and people get on her case and I do n't get it .
