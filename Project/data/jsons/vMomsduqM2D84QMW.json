''\n`` This deal wo n't be a farewell to arms , it will be a farewell to arms control ... a countdown to a potential nuclear nightmare , '' Netanyahu told lawmakers and visitors in the House of Representatives . His speech drew 26 standing ovations .\nNetanyahu both inveighed against the emerging terms of a deal and suggested broadening the scope of negotiations to require a change to Iran 's regional posture - an idea swiftly rejected by the Obama administration as de facto `` regime change '' in Tehran . But Netanyahu also avoided any call for new U.S. sanctions now or for a total rollback of Iranian nuclear technologies - a signal that Israel might be able to resign itself to less .\nNetanyahu 's speech culminated a diplomatic storm triggered by his acceptance in January of a Republican invitation that bypassed the White House and Obama 's fellow Democrats , many of whom considered it an affront to the president .\nObama refused to meet Netanyahu , saying that doing so just ahead of Israel 's March 17 general election would be seen as interference .
