    "content": "He trusts no one , and places a premium on revenge . ( `` If you do not get even , you are just a schmuck ! '' )\nHe treats every decision he makes `` like a lover , '' sometimes thinking with his head , other times with other parts of his body , because it reminds him to `` keep in touch with my basic impulses . ''\nAnd to make creative choices , he writes : `` I try to step back and remember my first shallow reaction . The day I realized it can be smart to be shallow was , for me , a deep experience . ''\nThis is Donald J. Trump as he sees himself and the world .\nCNN scoured thousands of pages of books , speeches , profiles and television interview transcripts from the past three decades to stitch together a portrait based entirely on the Republican presidential front-runner 's own words .\nTaken together , his words offer further insight into the leadership style of the billionaire-turned-politician , whose extraordinary candidacy has simultaneously electrified and repulsed large swaths of the electorate .\nThe GOP candidate has relentlessly mocked his opponents , lashed out at reporters and scorned the status quo . He has trusted his instincts , refused to apologize amid controversy , stood by his allies and sought to destroy his foes . He has focused on the big picture ( `` Make America Great Again '' ) rather than on details such as abortion policy .\nTrump authored more than a dozen books about his experiences in the business world that shaped this outlook -- most of them self-help treatises with titles including the 1987 best-seller `` The Art of the Deal , '' 2004 's `` Think Like a Billionaire : Everything You Need to Know About Success , Real Estate , and Life , '' and 2007 's `` Think Big . ''\nOn the campaign trail , Trump has brushed off questions about his temperament , his leadership style and how he would govern . He has derided the press as being `` among the most dishonest people ever created by God '' \u2014 insisting that reporters have gotten his story wrong time and again . On the campaign trail , Trump has brushed off questions about his temperament , his leadership style and how he would govern . He has derided the press as being `` among the most dishonest people ever created by God '' \u2014 insisting that reporters have gotten his story wrong time and again .\nTrump himself has shared his story in detail . Some recurrent themes in his writings include strength , success , self-confidence , distrust and revenge . He has often written and spoken about what he sees as the decline of the United States , a bedrock theme of his presidential campaign .\n`` The world is a vicious and brutal place , he wrote in `` Think Big . '' `` Even your friends are out to get you : They want your job , they want your house , they want your money , they want your wife , and they even want your dog . ''\n`` When people wrong you , go after those people , because it is a good feeling and because other people will see you doing it , '' he writes . `` I always get even . ''\n'If I had been the son of a coal miner '\nTrump 's life story , in the broadest of brush strokes , goes like this :\nHe was born the son of wealthy New York real-estate developer Fred C. Trump . He went to a private military academy in high school , attended Fordham for two years , then the Wharton School of Finance from which he graduated .\nWhile his father did business in Brooklyn and Queens , Trump set off to make his mark in Manhattan . He became fabulously wealthy ( think penthouse , helicopter , yacht , private plane ) in the real estate boom of the '80s , then nearly lost it all when the boom went bust . He has since rebounded to the tune \u2014 he says \u2014 of a personal fortune of $ 10 billion . ( Forbes estimates his net worth at $ 4.5 billion ) .\nAs he has run his empire and ascended as a mega star on reality TV , Trump has often been accused of being a bully , which he denies .\nHe does , however , acknowledge being a `` very assertive , aggressive kid . ''\nWhen he was in elementary school he formed the opinion that his music teacher did n't know much about music .\nSo , Trump punched him in the face , he wrote in 1987 's `` The Art of the Deal . ''\n`` In the second grade I actually gave a teacher a black eye , '' he wrote . `` I 'm not proud of that , but it 's clear evidence that even early on I had a tendency to stand up and make my opinions known in a very forceful way . The difference now is that I like to use my brain instead of my fists . '' ( He adds that he `` almost got expelled '' over the incident . )\nRelated : Donald Trump has had too much media coverage , 75 % of Americans say\nHe asked his little brother if he could borrow some of his . Yes , the brother said , as long as you give them back when you 're done . Another time , while playing with building blocks with his younger brother Robert , Trump ran out of blocks in the middle of a creation.He asked his little brother if he could borrow some of his . Yes , the brother said , as long as you give them back when you 're done .\nThe elder Trump completed his project and liked it so much that he glued the blocks together .\nIt was a self-admiration that would carry over into his real life as a builder .\nIn `` Think Big , '' he writes of the emotional reaction he has when arriving to work at Trump Tower .\n`` I love to see the crowds of people oohing and aahing at the stunning marble and the breathtaking 80-foot waterfall , '' he wrote . `` In truth I am dazzled as much by my own creations as are the tourists and glamour hounds that flock to Trump Tower ... or any of my other properties . ''\nThe mutual admiration of his work , Trump wrote , makes him feel `` a little closer to them even though we 've never met . ''\nThe billionaire developer has long felt a kinship with blue-collar workers -- and he believes the feeling is reciprocated . There is without question an aspirational nature to his candidacy , and blue-collar workers have shown up at the polls in droves to support his bid for the Republican nomination \u2014 often expressing admiration for his success and a belief that his financial wealth will free him from the influence of special interests if he makes it to the White House .\n`` Rich men are less likely to like me , '' Trump told Playboy in a 1990 interview , `` but the working man likes me because he knows I worked hard and did n't inherit what I 've built . ''\nTrump acknowledges he was born wealthy \u2014 he grew up in a 23-room house in the Jamaica Estates section of Queens \u2014 and that his father loaned him money to begin his own business . But he stresses that he set himself apart when he headed to Manhattan and began building skyscrapers instead of affordable rental units .\n`` I often say that I 'm a member of the lucky sperm club , '' he wrote in 2009 's `` Think Like A Champion . ''\n`` But did it give me a natural talent ? I do n't think so . It gave me an advantage that I deliberately chose to develop into an advantage . ''\nThere is an `` it '' factor people like him are born with , Trump has said .\nTo explain what he meant by `` it , '' Trump , the son of a multi-millionaire , evoked the plight of mine workers with black lung disease in the interview with Playboy .\n`` If I had been the son of a coal miner I would have left the damn mines , '' said Trump , then 43 . `` But most people do n't have the imagination\u2014or whatever \u2014 to leave their mine . ''\nTrump seems most self-critical when writing about the near collapse of his real-estate empire in 1990 .\n`` In the early 90s I was in a ton of debt . I had gone from the smartest guy in town to a complete zero , '' he wrote in 2007 's `` Think Big . '' `` I went from being a super genius to a moron . ''\nJUST WATCHED Trump breaks record , says 'excuse me ' 20 times Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump breaks record , says 'excuse me ' 20 times 01:51\nHe recalled walking down the street one day with his then-wife , Marla Maples , and reflecting on his situation . He pointed to a nearby man .\n`` That beggar over there is worth $ 900 million more than I am , '' he wrote .\n`` Because I 'm $ 900 million in debt , '' he replied , `` and at least he has money in his pocket . ''\nHe attributed his fall not only to the revision of the tax code by Congress in 1986 \u2014 which he said destroyed `` just about any incentive anyone might have for investing in real estate '' \u2014 but also to his own complacency .\n`` I got a little cocky , and probably , a little bit lazy , '' he wrote in 1997 's `` The Art Of The Comeback . '' `` I got a little cocky , and probably , a little bit lazy , '' he wrote in 1997 's `` The Art Of The Comeback . ''\n`` You just get a feeling of invincibility , '' he said , reflecting on his downward spiral in that book .\n`` You let down your guard . You do n't work as hard . Then things start to go in the wrong direction . ''\nTrump , who has written that he sleeps three-to-four hours a night so he can devote as much time as possible to his work , does not dwell on his misfortune on the campaign trail , except to establish the depths from which he re-emerged .\nHe threatened to sue a Washington Post reporter who wrote about the bankruptcy of the Taj Mahal , one of his casinos in Atlantic City , according to an interview with that reporter on NPR 's `` Fresh Air . '' Trump also reacted indignantly to a question about his bankruptcies during CNN 's September debate last year , insisting that he merely took advantage of U.S. laws to help his business .\nBack on top in the mid-2000s , Trump wrote `` Think Big , '' which shows the evolution of his management style and his values as a leader .\n`` I used to say , 'Go out and get the best people , and trust them . ' Over the years I have seen too many shenanigans , and now I say , 'Get the best people and do n't trust them . ' ''\n`` I always get even , '' he writes in a chapter dedicated to the subject .\nTo illustrate his point , he tells of a woman `` making peanuts '' in her government job before Trump recruited her to work for him in the 1980s . To illustrate his point , he tells of a woman `` making peanuts '' in her government job before Trump recruited her to work for him in the 1980s .\n`` She was a nobody in her government job and going nowhere , '' Trump wrote of the unnamed woman . `` I decided to make her into somebody . ''\nUnder his mentoring , Trump wrote , the woman became powerful in real estate and bought a beautiful home .\nWhen Trump was under intense financial pressure in the early '90s , he asked the woman to make a phone call to `` an extremely close friend of hers who held a powerful position at a big bank who would have done what she asked . ''\n`` Donald , I ca n't do that , '' she told Trump . `` Donald , I ca n't do that , '' she told Trump .\n`` She ended up losing her home . Her husband , who was only in it for the money , walked out on her and I was glad , '' he continued . `` Over the years many people have called asking for a recommendation for her . I only give her bad recommendations . ... This woman was very disloyal , and now I go out of my way to make her life miserable . ''\nTrump punctuated the anecdote with several bullet points at the end of the chapter , including :\n`` When somebody screws you , screw them back in spades '' and `` Go for the jugular so that people watching will not want to mess with you . ''\nThat approach was shaped by his own travails in business in the early 1990s as he watched his empire collapse around him .\n`` I believe in an eye for an eye \u2014 like the Old Testament says , '' he wrote in `` The Art of the Comeback . ''\n`` Some of the people who forgot to lift a finger when I needed them , when I was down , they need my help now , and I 'm screwing them against the wall . I 'm doing a number .... And I 'm having so much fun . ''\nWhile Trump 's writings and statements are geared primarily toward the business world , he has routinely weighed in on politics over the years .\nFavorite themes are the need for national strength and restoring America 's stature abroad , which he says has been diminishing for decades .\nIn the Playboy interview , he referred to the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square in which some 10,000 government troops killed an unknown number of protestors .\n`` When the students poured into Tiananmen Square , the Chinese government almost blew it , '' Trump said . `` Then they were vicious . They were horrible , but they put it down with strength . Our country is right now perceived as weak ... as being spit on by the rest of the world . ''\nIn `` Think Big , '' he criticized then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a smiling , waving lightweight who is no match for the murderous dictators she was dispatched to deal with .\n`` Condi Rice just goes over there to get her picture taken , '' Trump wrote .\nTrump states without equivocation that he could accomplish a feat that has eluded politicians for decades :\n`` I could negotiate peace in the Middle East -- very few other people could , '' he wrote in `` Think Big . ''\nAside from a brief flirtation with the idea of a presidential bid in 2000 , however , Trump has spent most of his years in the spotlight denying or downplaying such aspirations .\n`` I think I 'm almost too honest to be a politician , '' he told CNN in 1997 .\n`` I 'm too forthright . I 'm too \u2014 I think I 'm too honest , '' he said , `` but I do believe I 'm too forthright to be a politician . ''",
