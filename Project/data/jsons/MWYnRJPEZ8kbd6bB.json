    "content": "Two hooded men bearing Kalashnikovs burst into the Paris headquarters of the famed French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo yesterday and assassinated 12 people , including four cartoonists . As they committed their act of savagery , they shouted , \u201c Allahu Akbar ! \u201d and \u201c We have avenged the Prophet ! \u201d ( surely for Charlie Hebdo \u2019 s repeated satire of Islam ) . The men fled the scene -- as of first thing this morning , one suspect was in custody and police were searching for two others . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has raised Vigipirate , the country \u2019 s national security alert system , to its highest level in the \u00cele-de-France region encompassing Paris , which means stepped-up police and military patrols .\nThis is the second major Islamist attack on the magazine ; the first saw its offices fire-bombed in 2012 , after it had published cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad . Staff members , some of them my friends , have lived with death threats ( and police protection ) ever since . But the attackers , it seems , stormed through the officers on duty at the magazine to commit their crime .\nThe ( liberal ) French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande traveled to the scene of the slaughter and denounced an \u201c act of exceptional barbarity. \u201d Former President Nicolas Sarkozy , a conservative , also condemned the \u201c barbarism \u201d and called for national unity in the face of an attack against \u201c our democracy. \u201d President Obama issued a statement decrying the \u201c horrific shooting. \u201d United States Secretary of State John Kerry voiced solidarity in France \u2019 s fight against the \u201c extremism \u201d targeting \u201c free expression. \u201d Professing agreement with a French imam who , he said , called the victims \u201c martyrs for liberty , \u201d Kerry declared that , \u201c Brave and decent people around the world will never give in to the intimidation and the terror of those seeking to destroy [ the values of free expression and democracy ) . \u201d\nOn and on the politicians \u2019 avowals of support go . Yet one word is absent from all the grave , aggrieved verbiage . Surely their audiences will supply the missing noun , the prima facie yet material motive for the otherwise puzzling \u201c exceptional barbarity , \u201d the hitherto inexplicable \u201c horrific shooting , \u201d the nameless \u201c extremism \u201d \u2013 Islam . Attackers shouting \u201c Allahu Akbar ! \u201d don \u2019 t leave room for doubt .\nOr at least they shouldn \u2019 t . But you would not know it judging by the public responses of those tasked with assuring our safety and looking out for the common good . It is incendiary to name Islam as a culprit in atrocities : perhaps a tenth of France \u2019 s population is Muslim or descended from those who have arrived from the shores across the Mediterranean . Speaking frankly about Islam \u2019 s role in inspiring terrorist bloodshed would elicit cries of Islamophobia and intolerance , bigotry and even racism ( as though a belief system could be congenital ) , all liberal b\u00eates noires as shameful as they are misbegotten .\nComplicating matters , apologists would say , is that the West is hardly blameless . The United States continues to wage a murderous drone campaign against those it designates \u201c terrorists \u201d in countries across the Islamic world ; and this on the heels of its disastrous unprovoked war against Iraq , and a 13-year occupation , surely soon to be proved fruitless , of Afghanistan . France is a former colonial power with deep footprints in the Muslim world ; its own bloody 132-year sojourn in Algeria , for example , still bears bitter fruit in that country . And plus , there are lots of peaceful Muslims . So maybe it would be easiest and most politic to ignore , to passer sous silence , Islam \u2019 s role as a material element in the \u201c horrific shooting \u201d that took so many lives in Paris just now .\nTo do so might be easiest and it certainly is the most politically expedient , but the rank cowardice implicit in such a decision can not fail to provoke outrage . The attackers left no doubt about what drove them , and they can cite scriptural sanction for their savagery : the Quran ( 33:61 ) warns that those who insult Islam \u2013 and , as riots in the Middle East over Danish cartoons in 2006 showed , satire , in the eyes of too many Muslims , equals insult -- \u201c shall be seized and slain ( without mercy ) . \u201d Salman Rushdie , despite a fatwa ordaining his murder ( for his 1988 novel `` Satanic Verses '' ) , has so far escaped this fate ; the Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh ( for his film `` Submission , '' documenting violence against women in the Muslim world ) was not so lucky .\nThere are many other well-known examples . The point is , Islam is implicated in all .
