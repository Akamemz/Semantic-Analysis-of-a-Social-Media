    "content": "There is no war on terror for the Obama White House , but there is one on \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn a recent interview with The New Republic , President Obama was back to his grousing about the one television news outlet in America that won \u2019 t fall in line and treat him as emperor . Discussing breaking Washington 's partisan gridlock , the president told TNR , '' If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on \u2588\u2588\u2588 ... for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest , then you \u2019 ll see more of them doing it . ''\nAlas , the president loves to whine about the media meanies at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . To him , these are not people trying to do their jobs . No , they are out to get him . What other motive could a journalist have in holding a president accountable ? Why oh why do Ed Henry and Chris Wallace insist on asking hard questions ? Make them stop !\nThe president seems more comfortable talking to `` real journalists '' such as Chris Hughes , who asked the question in the TNR interview that elicited Obama 's reflexive Fox hatred . Hughes is the new owner of TNR and is a former major Obama campaign donor and organizer who was featured on the cover of Fast Company , with the headline , `` The Kid Who Made Obama President . '' You ca n't make this stuff up .\nThis latest volley from the president is just one in a long line of comments from his White House as part of their campaign to silence any dissent they detect in the press corps .\nRecently , the White House has kept \u2588\u2588\u2588 off of conference calls dealing with the Benghazi attack , despite \u2588\u2588\u2588 being the only outlet that was regularly reporting on it and despite Fox having top notch foreign policy reporters .\nThey have left Chris Wallace \u2019 s `` \u2588\u2588\u2588 Sunday '' out of a round of interviews that included CNN , NBC , ABC and CBS for not being part of a \u201c legitimate \u201d news network . In October 2009 , as part of an Obama administration onslaught against \u2588\u2588\u2588 , White House senior adviser David Axelrod said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week \u201d that the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Channel is `` not really a news station '' and that much of the programming is `` not really news . ''\nWhether you are liberal or conservative , libertarian , moderate or politically agnostic , everyone should be concerned when leaders of our government believe they can intentionally try to delegitimize a news organization they don \u2019 t like .\nIn fact , if you are a liberal \u2013 as I am \u2013 you should be the most offended , as liberalism is founded on the idea of cherishing dissent and an inviolable right to freedom of expression .\nThat more liberals are n't calling out the White House for this outrageous behavior tells you something about the state of liberalism in America today .\nSure , everyone understands how some of Fox 's opinion programming would get under President Obama 's skin , the same way MSNBC from 4pm until closing time is not the favorite stop for Republicans . But it 's not okay -- or presidential -- to continue smearing an entire network of hard working journalists because you are mad at Sean Hannity .\nDuring the initial launch of the war on \u2588\u2588\u2588 in October 2009 , then-White House Communications Director Anita Dunn told the New York Times of \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c [ W ] e don \u2019 t need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave. \u201d On CNN , she declared that Fox was a \u201c wing of the Republican Party. \u201d Then : \u201c let 's not pretend they 're a news network the way CNN is . ''\nGosh , this sounds so familiar . In fact , it \u2019 s exactly the line that Media Matters used in a 2010 memo to donors : \u201c \u2588\u2588\u2588 is not a news organization . It is the de facto leader of the GOP , and it is long past time that it is treated as such by the media , elected officials and the public . \u201d\nIn fact , this is the signature line of Media Matters in discussing \u2588\u2588\u2588 , which they say they exist to destroy . Their CEO , David Brock told Politico in 2011 that their strategy was a \u201c war on Fox \u201d that is executed by 90 staff members and a $ 10 million yearly budget , gratis liberal donors .\nCan someone explain to me how it \u2019 s \u201c liberal \u201d to try and shut down a media organization ? What the Obama administration is doing , and what liberals are funding at MMFA is beyond chilling \u2013 it \u2019 s a deep freeze .\nOn the heels of Dunn \u2019 s attack on Fox , Brock wrote a letter to progressive organizations bragging about the U.S. government trashing a news organization : \u201c In recent days , a new level of scrutiny has been directed toward \u2588\u2588\u2588 , in no small part due to statements from the White House , and from Media Matters , challenging its standing as a news organization. \u201d Point of order : who put Media Matters in charge of determining what is and is n't a news operation ?\nA Media Matters memo found its way into the public domain and if you care at all about decency and freedom of the press , it will make you throw up . If you like McCarthyism , it \u2019 s right up your alley . It details to liberal donors how they have plans to assemble opposition research on \u2588\u2588\u2588 employees .\nIt complains of the \u201c pervasive unwillingness among members of the media to officially kick \u2588\u2588\u2588 to the curb of the press club \u201d and outlines how they are going to change that through targeting elite media figures and turning them against Fox . They say they want to set up a legal fund to sue ( harass ) conservatives for any \u201c slanderous \u201d comments they make about progressives on air . They actually cite one of the best journalists around , Jake Tapper , as a problem because he questioned the White House about calling a news outlet \u201c illegitimate. \u201d Tapper can see the obvious : if the White House can call one news outlet illegitimate for asking tough questions , then guess who is next ? Anyone .\nWe defend freedom of the press because of the principle , not because we like everything the press does . For example , I defend MSNBC \u2019 s right to run liberal programming to their hearts content .\nMonitoring the media is actually a good thing ; the media should be held accountable , including \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

They say they are \u201c consider [ ing ] pushing prominent progressives to stop appearing on \u2588\u2588\u2588. \u201d For those who defy the order , they threaten to start daily publishing the names of Democrats who appear in order to shame them .
