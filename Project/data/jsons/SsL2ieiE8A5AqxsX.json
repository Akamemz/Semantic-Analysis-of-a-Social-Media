Annie Karni is a politics reporter .\nHalfway through her long and humbling summer , Hillary Clinton ran into an old friend who wanted to know how she was bearing up under the pressure of near-daily revelations about the use of her private email server during her time in the State Department . Clinton was unmistakably unhappy .\n\u201c I am having two problems , \u201d she bluntly told the supporter at a social event . \u201c On the one hand , I feel like I \u2019 m rolling out a lot of substantive programs on issues that people care about . We \u2019 re getting one day \u2019 s news coverage . But there \u2019 s nothing larger knitting it together . We \u2019 re not breaking through . \u2026 And my team needs to get their act together on the email response . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s frustration with her own campaign staff was striking . So was her refusal for much of the year to characterize the escalating email controversy as anything other than a failure of communications , messaging or the vast right-wing-and-media conspiracy . Both complaints were consistent with what other campaign advisers told us in dozens of interviews for this story\u2014except some of them laid equal blame on the candidate herself .\nIndeed , from the minute news of Clinton \u2019 s secret personal email server broke this past March , she had reacted by lashing out at her enemies\u2014and repeatedly demanding of her inner circle , \u201c How do we get past this ? \u201d Neither the campaign nor the candidate have definitively answered that question , and the months of indecision , uncertainty and mounting legal threat have left Clinton , for the second time in her two presidential campaigns , a deeply vulnerable front-runner .\nFrom the start , the email controversy\u2014and her campaign \u2019 s handling of it\u2014has been an exercise in exasperation , according to people involved in the effort . The wiry and wily John Podesta , Clinton \u2019 s campaign chairman , thought right away that she needed to dump everything out in public as quickly as possible to avoid the deadly drip-drip-drip . \u201c We need to throw the facts to the dogs , and let \u2019 em chew on it , \u201d Podesta told the candidate . But Clinton \u2019 s answer\u2014and that of her lawyer David Kendall and her former State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills\u2014was a \u201c no \u201d when Podesta and other advisers asked for some details . Foggy Bottom needed to review the emails , they were told , and besides , half of them , the ones deemed \u201c personal , \u201d had already been deleted .\nAt least Clinton was talking regularly with Podesta . In the concentric circles of Clintonworld , many of the political team she had put in place to run her campaign were still considered outsiders , hired hands more loyal to President Barack Obama or to her husband , former President Bill Clinton , than to the candidate herself , and as soon as the New York Times dropped its bombshell server story , they saw themselves as stymied by a legal team parsimonious with disclosure and a candidate reluctant to express remorse . Their daily conference calls , which could include as many as 15 staffers and lawyers on the line , often descended to little more than collective venting .\n\u201c Why does the other side always know more than we do ? \u201d an aide pointedly asked Kendall during one call early in the unfolding email drama . But little more was forthcoming , according to a longtime Clinton adviser who recounted the incident .\nIt sounds crazy , but I think she simply wasn \u2019 t equipped to deal with all this , \u201d says one longtime ally .\nThe campaign was becoming just the kind of defensive race none of them , least of all the candidate , expected to be running , and for months and months the emails distracted and diverted a Clinton team that seemed powerless to move beyond the unfolding scandal . While her team bought Clinton \u2019 s basic argument that she had done nothing illegal or even fundamentally wrong , it rekindled longstanding concerns about her judgment . It was hard to avoid the view that she had walked right into a trap at a time when the GOP seemed to be imploding in a Trump-shaped mushroom cloud .\n\u201c It sounds crazy , but I think she simply wasn \u2019 t equipped to deal with all this , \u201d says one longtime ally who has been in regular contact with Clinton . \u201c She \u2019 s never been a great candidate , OK ? She needed time and campaigns don \u2019 t give you time . \u2026 She was blindsided , and I think only now , after all this crap , is she finally in the right headspace . \u201d\nNearly every one of 50 advisers , donors , Democratic operatives and friends we interviewed for this story thought Clinton was a mediocre candidate who would make a good president , if given the chance . They painted a portrait of a politician who talked about learning from past mistakes while methodically repeating them\u2014a far cry from the formidable shatterer of glass ceilings who had put such a scare into Obama late in the 2008 primaries .\nOne longtime Clinton family adviser called the emails a \u201c cancer \u201d on her campaign . Another told us , \u201c She \u2019 s her own worst enemy. \u201d And many described moments of anxiety as Clinton , backed up by the protective firewall of her legal team , refused to take full personal responsibility even to her own aides . \u201c I have done nothing wrong , \u201d she repeatedly told them .\nFacing pressure from within and without , Clinton by early fall had started a long-overdue contrition tour , apologizing publicly and privately as her beleaguered staff had urged her to do for months . Moreover , she had moved beyond some of the crippling caution that hampered her initial response , and her campaign finally seemed liberated to start whacking away at Republicans with some of the glee missing from the race \u2019 s early months . \u201c Obviously , we got battered , \u201d Podesta told us . \u201c But we \u2019 re stabilizing . \u201d\nBut is she ? Clinton \u2019 s unfavorable rating has spiked 10 to 15 points in the past year , the percentage of voters who say they trust her has plummeted to 35 percent in a pre-debate CBS poll , and Bernie Sanders , a career socialist who has publicly refused to endorse capitalism , is beating her in New Hampshire . Not to mention that each month brings a steady drumbeat of new disclosures as the State Department complies with a court order to review and make public the roughly 35,000 emails Clinton handed over .\nAnd yet Clinton should not be counted out ; she \u2019 s leading the nearest contender in the Democratic race by 20 percentage points and looking ahead to a general election against an internally divided Republican Party that seems intent on eating its own .
