The two major storylines dominating coverage seem to directly contradict each other .\nOne narrative shows America behaving like a country that has contained the virus . Every state has lifted at least some of its lockdown restrictions . More businesses are reopening . The president is scaling down the activities of his coronavirus task force while planning to resume campaign rallies . Protesters have gathered en masse in cities across the country .\nThat series of events can be hard to reconcile with a troubling trend in many states that suggests the outbreak is far from contained and may actually be getting worse . Dozens of states have seen increases in case numbers over the past two weeks . Texas , Florida and Arizona \u2014 states that largely avoided major outbreaks in the early stages of the pandemic \u2014 set records for daily case numbers on Tuesday . Some places that were hit the worst in March and April , like New York , are seeing numbers continue to trend downward .\nThe U.S. has by far the most severe outbreak in the world , with more than 2 million cases and 117,000 deaths . Both those figures are at least double what any other nation has seen . The current trend , in which restrictions are being lifted despite rising case numbers , has raised concerns that the country is essentially abandoning its effort to stamp out the virus and instead deciding that reopening the economy and returning to normal life is the priority .\nThough the U.S. is not the only country struggling with the virus right now , many nations have managed their outbreaks effectively and are beginning to safely reopen . The road map to successful containment is largely the same in each place : lockdowns to restrict the initial phase of infections , followed by robust programs of testing and contract tracing , and widespread mask usage .\nThe U.S. did initiate lockdowns , and they appear to have been effective . One study suggests the restrictions prevented up to 60 million coronavirus infections . But the latter steps of testing and contact tracing \u2014 which epidemiologists agree are crucial to keeping the virus in check when lockdowns are lifted \u2014 are not being carried out at nearly the scale they need to be in the U.S. , experts say . Heated partisan debates have also led to mask requirements being lifted in many places .\nThere was significant attention on the first states to begin reopening in late April and early May , but the pandemic has largely taken a back seat to the ongoing protests against police violence and racism across the country . At the same time , political leaders have also pulled back from their focus on the virus . The Trump administration has largely shifted its efforts to other issues . Congress appears reticent to produce another massive stimulus bill to support the unemployed or bail out struggling states .
