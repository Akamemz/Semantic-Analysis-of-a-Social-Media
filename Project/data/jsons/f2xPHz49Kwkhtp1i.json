    "content": "Central American children may be surging across the southwest border , but their effect is felt in school districts across the country \u2014 and nowhere more than in Alexandria , Virginia , where federal authorities this year placed 205 in a city of fewer than 150,000 people .\nThe children could increase the school-age population in the county by more than 1 percent , marking a significant influx of students likely to need intense help with English and other remedial education programs .\nNo longer just a border problem , the surge is now an issue for officials in communities throughout the country , where 126 counties or cities have at least 50 children , almost all of them school age , who have been placed with relatives or foster families within their jurisdictions .\n\u201c It challenges us every day , \u201d said Scott Kizner , superintendent of schools in Harrisonburg , Virginia . \u201c A lot of these children require special services . \u201d\nWith the school year gearing up , districts are grappling with the situation . One county reported that as many as half of the children from the border surge have experienced major psychological trauma , either from gang violence in their home countries or hardships such as hunger and rape during their journey to the U.S .\n\u201c We have seen kids who are traumatized by violence or being witnesses to violence , \u201d said Patricia Chiancone , an outreach counselor at the Prince George \u2019 s County Public Schools \u2019 international student counseling office .\nSEE ALSO : Obama talks tough on terror but shies away from \u2018 war \u2019\nMore common are educational struggles . School districts say the children lag behind in English language skills and trail their peers in core subjects .\nData released last month showed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had processed and released more than 37,000 children to sponsors in the first seven months this year . That doesn \u2019 t include several thousand other children still in shelters either run by the federal government or the 116 private or municipal facilities HHS is paying to house and care for the children .\nHHS refuses to divulge those locations , though documents included in a government contract from the Homeland Security Department list 116 facilities that have been used to house children this year . Those facilities are responsible for feeding , educating and providing medical care to the youngsters .\nOnce the children are released to relatives or foster families , those sponsors take over responsibilities , including enrolling the children in schools .\nIn Fairfax County , the 1,023 children placed over the first seven months of the year could account for almost half of the school district \u2019 s 2,200 new students this year . But officials said they aren \u2019 t keeping tabs .\n\u201c We are not enforcing immigration laws . That is not our function . We are educating children , \u201d said Fairfax County Public Schools spokesman John Torre . \u201c In our circumstance , I believe these students are being absorbed into the overall enrollment growth that we have seen for a number of years now . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been working with these families all summer , \u201d said Arlington Public Schools spokesman Frank Bellavia . He said the school district has been accustomed to large influxes of international students since the 1970s , when it had an influx of Mongolians .\nThis year , Mr. Bellavia said , Arlington has worked to make sure the students end up in appropriate classes , including special \u201c accelerator \u201d courses for those who don \u2019 t speak English .\n\u201c What we are finding is these students are coming in with gaps in their education . Some of them have no education , \u201d said Mr. Bellavia . \u201c So then we place them into an accelerated program where we can teach them English , and then we go from there . \u201d\nIn Prince George \u2019 s County , 960 of the children have been placed with sponsors , and the school system has hired additional English-language instructors .\nAs many as half of the newcomers face psychological challenges , but their trauma has not led to an increase in violence in schools , Ms. Chiancone said . She said most of those dealing with psychological trauma become withdrawn or truant .\nMost of the children are high school age , the county estimates . The school works in conjunction with county social service agencies to help the children and their families , Ms. Chiancone said .\nAlexandria , a city tucked between Fairfax and Arlington counties and the District of Columbia , had 205 of the children placed with sponsors from January through July . That works out to more than 13 potential new students for every 1,000 school-age children \u2014 the highest ratio of any jurisdiction in the country .\nThe district said it hasn \u2019 t had to make any major changes to accommodate the young immigrants , said Alexandria City Public Schools spokeswoman Kelly L. Alexander .\nSchool officials could not differentiate between unaccompanied minors released by federal authorities and other immigrant or international students , she said .\n\u201c We already have systems in place to deal with the students , \u201d she said , noting the large number of students in the school district who don \u2019 t speak English .\n\u201c We have a basic set of processes we do for [ English language learners ] , \u201d said Ms. Alexander . \u201c We have not had to make any adjustments at this point regarding budget . \u201d\nTwo hours away in Harrisonburg , the 65 unaccompanied minors placed in the city represent the third-biggest per capita rate in the country .\nMr. Kizner , the superintendent , said about 5,500 children were enrolled on the first day of school .
