( Jason Reed/Reuters )\nThe Obama administration blatantly politicized the government \u2019 s intelligence and law-enforcement apparatus .\nOur contretemps over the nomenclature of government informants has me unable to shake this arresting moment from my memory . In Manhattan , about 30 years ago , I was among the spectators basking in the majesty of Foley Square \u2019 s federal courthouse when we were suddenly jarred by this , shall we say , rhetorical question . The sniper was a mob lawyer in a big RICO case ; the target was the prosecution \u2019 s main witness , the informant .\nUntil this week , I \u2019 d always thought the most noteworthy thing about this obnoxious bit of theater was the reaction of the judge , a very fine , very wry trial lawyer in his own right .\nThe judge calmly shrugged his shoulders and ruled : \u201c He can answer if he knows . \u201d\nDid he know ? I don \u2019 t remember . I was laughing too hard to hear any response .\nThe court \u2019 s deadpan was not just hilarious . In its way , it was trenchant .\nThe judge was not insouciant . He was a realist . The witness had done what covert informants do : He pretended to be someone he wasn \u2019 t , he wheedled his way into the trust \u2014 in some instances , into the affections \u2014 of people suspected of wrongdoing . And then he betrayed them . But that \u2019 s the job : to pry away secrets \u2014 get the bad actors to admit what they did , how they did it , and with whom they did it , until the agents and prosecutors decide there is enough evidence to convict the lot of them .\nThe judge understood that . For all the melodrama , whether the informant was a hero or a villain hinged on how one felt not about him but about the worthiness of the investigation .\nAnd just as the mob lawyer served his case , the government lawyers served theirs , portraying the informant as noble \u2014 or at least as noble as you can be when your job is to deceive people into confessing things they shouldn \u2019 t .\nAlas , whether we \u2019 re talking about criminal investigations or intelligence operations , the search for truth is a study in contrasting hyperbole and euphemism .\nIn the courtroom , the prosecutors are referred to as \u201c the government , \u201d but they swell with pride \u2014 I know I did \u2014 at any opportunity to tell you they actually represent \u201c the People of the United States of America. \u201d The defense can have its vaunted presumption of innocence ; the unstated presumption in a criminal trial is that the prosecutor is the guy in the white hat . He \u2019 s the earnest public servant , just trying to show what really happened \u2014 he \u2019 s not there to sow doubt , to trick you like those sharks over at the defense table . And if , by reputation and manner , he manages to convince the judge and the jury of his probity and competence , the prosecutor gets to set the narrative .\nThe ability to set the narrative is the biggest advantage in any public controversy . And prosecutors are not alone in exploiting it . It is the m\u00e9tier of government officials . As progressivism has magnified the administrative state , the self-image of federal bureaucrats has become technocratic altruism : Let us explain what \u2019 s going on ; after all , we \u2019 re just selflessly looking out for you , calling agenda-free balls and strikes . Think of Barack Obama , dyed-in-the-wool leftist , insisting he \u2019 s just a pragmatic , non-ideological problem-solver .\nIs this bureaucracy \u201c the deep state \u201d ? That \u2019 s an exaggeration \u2014 try , say , China or Turkey if you want to see what a real deep state looks like . Nevertheless , our modern form of government does make technocrats a force to be reckoned with , and they abide supervision and oversight only by other progressives . When a constitutionalist has the temerity to observe that technocrats are subordinate to executive political leadership and must answer to the legislature that created and funds their agencies , they brood about their \u201c independence. \u201d In their minds , they are an unaccountable fourth branch of government \u2014 at least until their fellow non-ideological pragmatists return to power .\nFor this species of arrogance , setting the narrative is a jealously guarded prerogative . We are to understand the bureaucracy \u2019 s work as unimpeachably noble and that so , therefore , are its tactics . Consequently , the government \u2019 s \u201c cooperator \u201d is never to be called a spy . He \u2019 s a \u201c confidential informant \u201d or , as the FBI \u2019 s former Director James Comey put it in a tweet this week , a \u201c confidential human source . \u201d\nThese are not neutral terms .
