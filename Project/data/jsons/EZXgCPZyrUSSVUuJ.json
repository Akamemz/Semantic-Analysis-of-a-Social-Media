He is due to report to prison for a three-year sentence in May .\nCohen 's testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee started at 10 a.m .\nCummings gaveled the hearing to a close after roughly seven hours .\nCohen delivered testimony on a broad array of subjects , including Trump 's business , the president 's involvement in potentially criminal acts and his past work for Trump .\nCohen will meet privately with members of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday .\nCummings closed the hearing with an impassioned plea for lawmakers to \u201c get back to normal \u201d and to consider the country they are leaving future generations .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know why this is happening for you , but it is my hope that a small part of it is for our country to be better , \u201d Cummings said to Cohen at the conclusion of roughly seven hours of testimony .\n\u201c The president called you a 'rat , ' \u201d Cummings added . \u201c We \u2019 re better than that . We really are . I \u2019 m hoping that all of us can get back to his democracy that we want and that we should be passing on to our children so that they can do better than what we did . \u201d\nCohen became visibly emotional as Cummings acknowledged the difficulty of the circumstances for the longtime Trump attorney .\n\u201c Hopefully this portion of your destiny will lead to a better Michel Cohen , a better Donald Trump , a better United States of America , and a better world , \u201d Cummings said as Cohen reached for a drink of water .\nThe chairman grew more impassioned , shouting into the microphone as he called on lawmakers to reflect on how they \u2019 re protecting democracy .\nHe took a swipe at Republicans , who earlier in the hearing suggested holding a hearing with Cohen was an indication that Democrats were out to get the president .\nCummings noted that the committee previously held a hearing on prescription drug prices .\n\u201c We can do more than one thing , \u201d Cummings said . \u201c And we have got to get back to normal . \u201d\nCohen lashed out at the president in his closing remarks , saying he refuses to remain silent in light of the harm he says Trump is inflicting on the country .\n\u201c I have acknowledged I have made my own mistakes and I have owned up to them publicly and under oath , but silence and complicity in the face of the daily destruction of our basic norms and civility to one another will not be one of them , \u201d he said .\nHe went on to attack Trump over various behaviors and policies , including his attacks of the media , his zero-tolerance immigration policy and the government shutdown .\n\u201c We honor our veterans even in the rain . You tell the truth even when it doesn \u2019 t aggrandize you . You respect the law and our incredible law enforcement agents , you don \u2019 t villainize them . You don \u2019 t disparage generals , gold star families , prisoners of war and other heroes who had the courage to fight for this country . You don \u2019 t attack the media and those that question what you don \u2019 t like or what you don \u2019 t want them to say , \u201d he said .\n\u201c You take responsibility for your own dirty deeds . You don \u2019 t use your power of your bully pulpit to destroy the credibility of those who speak out against you . You don \u2019 t separate families from one another or demonize those looking to America for a better life . You don \u2019 t vilify people based on the God they pray to . And you don \u2019 t cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies . And finally , you don \u2019 t shut down the government before Christmas and New Years just to simply appease your base . \u201d\nCohen noted that his work for Trump has cost him nearly everything , ranging from his law license to his freedom , adding that his knowledge of how the president operates makes him fear about the transition of power should Trump lose in next year \u2019 s presidential election .\n\u201c I did things and I acted improperly , at times at Mr. Trump \u2019 s behest . I blindly followed his demands . My loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything . My family \u2019 s happiness , friendships , my law license , my company , my livelihood , my honor , my reputation , and soon my freedom , \u201d he said .\n\u201c And I will not sit back , say nothing and allow him to do the same to the country . Indeed , given my experience working for Mr. Trump , I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power . \u201d\nRep. Rashida Tlaib ( D-Mich. ) sparked a confrontation with Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) when she said it was a \u201c racist act \u201d to use a black woman to refute allegations of racism against Trump .\n`` Just because someone has a person of color , a black person working for them does not mean that they are n't racist , '' Tlaib said .\n`` And it is insensitive ... the fact that someone would actually use a prop , a black woman in this chamber , in this committee , is alone racist in itself , '' Tlaib continued , getting emotional .\nMeadows had invited Lynne Patton , a Trump administration staffer , who is black , to the hearing to push back against Cohen 's allegations during his testimony that the president is a racist .\nMeadows immediately responded , asking that Tlaib 's comments be stricken from the record as he believed it was an attack on him .\nThe freshman Democrat then clarified her comments , saying that she was n't accusing Meadows of being a racist but that she believed it was a `` racist act '' to bring a black woman to the hearing to counter allegations of racism against Trump .\n`` There \u2019 s nothing more personal to me than my relations ... my niece and nephew are people of color , not many people know that , '' Meadows said .\n`` And to indicate that I asked someone who is a personal friend of the Trump family\u2026that \u2019 s she \u2019 s coming in to be a prop , it \u2019 s racist to suggest that I asked her to come in for that reason , '' he said .\nOcasio-Cortez gathers names of Trump associates with knowledge of his finances\nCohen testified Wednesday that President Trump inflated and deflated his assets over the years , and provided Rep.

The longtime Trump attorney added that the congresswoman could find more information and documentation on the practice at the Trump Organization , and from Allen Weisselberg , Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari .\nCohen also confirmed to Ocasio-Cortez that Trump was interested in reducing his local tax bills by deflating his assets . The New York congresswoman cited a golf club near her home district as an example .\n`` You deflate the value of the asset and then you put in a request to the tax department for a deduction , '' Cohen said , explaining the practice .\nCohen said he did not know whether an October New York Times report that Trump engaged in dubious tax practices to reap millions was true , but said Weisselberg would .\nCohen expressed doubt on whether Trump 's tax returns were actually under audit by the IRS during the presidential election .\nThe president has cited an audit as the reason he has n't made his tax documents public .\nWhen Rep. Jimmy Gomez Jimmy GomezHouse Democrats offer bill to expand the estate tax House Democrats blur lines on support for impeachment Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment MORE ( D-Calif. ) asked Cohen if he knew whether Trump 's tax returns were actually under audit in 2016 , Cohen replied , `` I do n't know the answer . ''\n`` I asked for a copy of the audit so that I could use it in terms of my statements to the press , and I was never able to obtain one , '' Cohen said .\nCohen said that Trump told him that he did n't want think tanks examining his tax returns , leading to an audit that could result in penalties .\nUnder IRS policy , the agency audits the sitting president 's tax returns . However , the IRS has said that audits do n't prevent people from releasing their own tax returns .\nDemocrats are interested in viewing Trump 's tax returns to learn about any conflicts of interest he may have .\nCohen said that he 's seen Trump 's returns but has never gone through them . He described the returns as `` quite long . ''\nThe hearing reconvened later Wednesday afternoon . Cohen entered the room and sat back in his seat , as photographers snapped photos of him for about a minute .\nThe committee broke for a brief recess so that lawmakers could vote . The hearing is expected to reconvene about a half hour after the final vote series Wednesday afternoon .\nThe committee is expected to move through just one round of questions with Cohen , according to a committee aide .\nCohen said he fears threats that have poured in over social media , suggesting the president \u2019 s social media use has sparked online angst .\n\u201c When you have access to 60 million plus people that follow you on social media and you have the ability within which to spark some action by individuals that follow him , and from his own words that he can walk down Fifth Avenue , shoot someone and get away with it , it \u2019 s never comfortable , \u201d Cohen said before trailing off .\nCohen added that he fears \u201c a lot , and it \u2019 s not just him . It \u2019 s those people that follow him and his rhetoric . \u201d\nThe former Trump lawyer said he \u2019 s had to adjust his everyday habits out of fear from online threats .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t walk with my wife if we go to a restaurant , go somewhere , I don \u2019 t walk with my children . I make them go before me because I have fear , and it \u2019 s the same fear that I had before when he initially decided to drop that tweet in my cell phone , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I received some tweets , I received some Facebook Messenger , all sorts of social media attacks upon me whether it \u2019 s a private direct message that I \u2019 ve had to turn over to Secret Service because they \u2019 re the most vile , disgusting statements that anyone can ever receive , and when it starts to affect your children , that \u2019 s when it really affects you . \u201d\nEarlier in the hearing , Cohen accused the president of seeking to intimidate him prior to his testimony , citing Trump \u2019 s accusations that he is a \u201c rat . \u201d\nAdult-film star Stormy Daniels thanked Cohen for telling `` the truth '' about the hush money payments she received to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump .\nDaniels issued a statement to MSNBC as Cohen testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform expressing sympathy for him and his family .\n\u201c Michael , I \u2019 m proud of you for finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did , and trying to repair some of the harm you have caused , \u201d Daniels said . \u201c I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country . My heart goes out to you and your family . \u201d\nDaniels said she empathized with Cohen \u2019 s fear , and noted that he and the president previously called her a liar . Daniels alleged during a \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d interview last year that an individual implied something would happen to her daughter if she spoke about the alleged affair with Trump .\n\u201c Thank you for having the courage , at long last , to begin to tell the truth , \u201d she added . \u201c I hope that some day soon your family and mine can both leave this nightmare behind . \u201d\nCohen testified that Trump was aware of the scheme to pay Daniels $ 130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump .\nCohen said the president called him in February 2018 to coordinate public messaging after reports on the payment first emerged , and provided a copy of a check from Trump that was a reimbursement for the payment to Daniels .\nThe president has provided shifting explanations about his knowledge of the payments , but has denied the alleged affair and insisted the hush money arrangement did not violate campaign finance laws .\nCohen says he discussed Russia travel with Corey Lewandowski Corey R. LewandowskiKey takeaways from first public impeachment hearing Democrats face make-or-break moment on impeachment \u2588\u2588\u2588 's 12:30 Report : Trump demands Bidens testify MORE\nCohen said that he discussed the possibility of Trump traveling to Russia in connection with the Trump Moscow project with Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandoski .\nCourt filings unsealed in November state that Cohen \u201c asked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia \u201d during the 2016 campaign . Trump identified that individual as Lewandowski on Wednesday .\n\u201c [ Trump ] told me to speak to Corey to see what dates might be available , \u201d Cohen said .\nCohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about discussing plans to travel to Russia in connection with the project . Neither he nor Trump ultimately traveled to Russia as part of the discussions and the real-estate deal never came to fruition .\nCohen provides more 'catch and kill ' details , denies existence of tape showing Trump striking his wife\nCohen provided more details about the `` catch and kill '' arrangements made through AMI to squash unflattering stories about Trump .\nHe first denied that there is a tape of Trump striking his wife in an elevator , which has been rumored to exist .\n`` I 'm certain it \u2019 s not true , '' Cohen said , adding that there have multiple attempts to buy the tape if it did exist .\nAnd he said that another story purchased by AMI to kill it about Trump having a love child is also not true , to the best of his knowledge .\nCohen told lawmakers that he has never traveled to Prague .\nMcClatchy reported last year that foreign intelligence services had evidence of a mobile phone linked to Cohen pinging cell towers around Prague between August and September 2016 .\nThe report , which Cohen denied at the time , gave credence to a claim in the controversial Trump-Russia dossier that Cohen as Trump \u2019 s lawyer secretly met with Russian government representatives in Prague in August 2016 .\nCohen says Trump directed him to lie about hush money payment\nCohen testified that Trump called him in February 2018 and directed him to mislead the public about the president 's knowledge of a hush money payment to adult-film star Daniels .\nCohen told lawmakers Trump called him while he was meeting with a reporter in February 2018 to coordinate on public messaging about payments to Daniels , who alleges she had an affair with the president .\n`` What did president ask or suggest you say about the payments or reimbursements ? '' Rep. Katie Hill ( D-Calif. ) asked .\n\u201c He was not knowledgeable of these reimbursements and he wasn \u2019 t knowledgeable of my actions , '' Cohen said .\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported in January 2018 that Cohen had paid Daniels $ 130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump . The president has denied the affair took place .\nTrump has offered shifting explanations about when he knew about the payments , but initially told reporters that he was unfamiliar with the arrangement to pay Daniels .\nCohen told lawmakers that his statement issued in February 2018 that he used his own personal funds to pay Daniels and that `` neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was party to the transaction '' or reimbursed him was technically accurate .\n`` I purposefully left out Mr. Trump individually from that statement , '' Cohen said .\n`` Because that 's what was discussed to do between myself , Mr. Trump and Mr. Weisselberg , '' he said , referencing Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg .\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance law violations related to the payment to Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal , who also alleged she had an affair with Trump . He said in court documents at the time that he made the payments at Trump 's direction .\nCohen says he came up with idea of Trump presidential bid in 2011\nCohen said that he came up with the idea that Trump should run for president back in 2011 .\n\u201c I saw a document in a newspaper that said who would you vote for in 2012 , 6 percent of the people said they would vote for Donald Trump , \u201d Cohen said\n\u201c I said to him , \u2018 Mr . Trump look at this \u2019 and he said \u2018 well wouldn \u2019 t that be great ? \u2019 \u201d Cohen said . \u201c And that \u2019 s how it all started . \u201d\nCohen also said he started the website shouldtrumprun.com in 2011 . That site is no longer active .\nMeadows snaps at Cohen amid questioning : 'Do n't give me that bull '\nMeadows grew frustrated while pressing Cohen on whether former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean advised Cohen 's lawyer Lanny Davis on submitting his testimony last minute .\nCohen , who denied that he had spoken personally to Dean , said he was working late on his testimony Tuesday night ahead of his public appearance .\n\u201c So you were writing it last night ? \u201d Meadows said , thrusting down his papers in a sign of frustration . \u201c Don \u2019 t give me that bull . \u201d\nCohen , who appeared taken aback by the remark , said he was working with his lawyers to make \u201c edits all the way through the night . \u201d\n`` We were working until 11 , 12 o \u2019 clock last night to finish everything , '' Cohen told Meadows .\nGOP rep defends Trump against Cohen claim he did n't want to be president\nRep. Glenn Grotham ( R-Wis. ) pushed back against Cohen \u2019 s assertion in his opening testimony that Trump had no desire to lead the country and that he campaigned for president to boost the Trump brand .\n\u201c I just want to clarify that I dealt with President Trump several times as he was trying to get Wisconsin , \u201d Grotham said . \u201c He was always confident . He was working very hard . And this idea that somehow he was just running to raise his profile for some future venture , at least in my experience , is preposterous .\n\u201c I find it offensive when anti-Trump people imply that he didn \u2019 t expect to win , \u201d he added .\nCohen said in his opening remarks that Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great , not to make our country great , '' adding that the president \u201c never expected to win the primary \u201d and \u201c never expected to win the general election . ''\n\u201c The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity , \u201d Cohen said .\nCohen says changes were made to testimony about Trump Moscow deal after meeting with Trump lawyers\nWhen asked about whether Trump \u2019 s personal lawyers made changes to his written 2017 congressional testimony , Cohen replied , \u201c There were changes made . \u201d\nCohen said changes were made to the testimony at a meeting with Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow but he didn \u2019 t go into detail about them beyond saying they were about the message regarding how long the discussions about building a Trump property in Moscow went on .\n\u201c There will several changes that were made , including how we were going to handle that message , \u201d Cohen said .\nIn November , Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about the real-estate property discussions . Cohen admitted , among other things , that the talks extended as late as June 2016 \u2014 six months longer than he testified .\nCohen says there are other examples of wrongdoing involving Trump that he ca n't discuss\nCohen told lawmakers that he 's aware of additional illegal acts President Trump committed that have not been discussed at Wednesday 's hearing , but that he could not elaborate because they relate to a Southern District of New York investigation .\nCohen estimated that he last spoke with Trump or someone acting on his behalf last fall , though he could not recall a specific date .\n`` I would suspect it was within two months post-the raid , \u201d he said , referring to the April 2018 FBI raid of his home , hotel room and office .\nAsked what they discussed , Cohen said , `` Unfortunately this topic is actually something that \u2019 s being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York , and I \u2019 ve been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues .

However, the IRS has said that audits don't prevent people from releasing their own tax returns.\n\nDemocrats are interested in viewing Trump's tax returns to learn about any conflicts of interest he may have.\n\nCohen said that he's seen Trump's returns but has never gone through them.

Daniels alleged during a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview last year that an individual implied something would happen to her daughter if she spoke about the alleged affair with Trump.\n\n\u201cThank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope that some day soon your family and mine can both leave this nightmare behind.\u201d\n\nCohen testified that Trump was aware of the scheme to pay Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump.\n\nCohen said the president called him in February 2018 to coordinate public messaging after reports on the payment first emerged, and provided a copy of a check from Trump that was a reimbursement for the payment to Daniels.\n\nThe president has provided shifting explanations about his knowledge of the payments, but has denied the alleged affair and insisted the hush money arrangement did not violate campaign finance laws.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nCohen says he discussed Russia travel with Corey Lewandowski Corey R. LewandowskiKey takeaways from first public impeachment hearing Democrats face make-or-break moment on impeachment The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump demands Bidens testify MORE\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nCohen said that he discussed the possibility of Trump traveling to Russia in connection with the Trump Moscow project with Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandoski.\n\nCourt filings unsealed in November state that Cohen \u201casked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia\u201d during the 2016 campaign. Trump identified that individual as Lewandowski on Wednesday.\n\n\u201c[Trump] told me to speak to Corey to see what dates might be available,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about discussing plans to travel to Russia in connection with the project. Neither he nor Trump ultimately traveled to Russia as part of the discussions and the real-estate deal never came to fruition.\n\n\u2014 Morgan Chalfant\n\nCohen provides more 'catch and kill' details, denies existence of tape showing Trump striking his wife\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nCohen provided more details about the \"catch and kill\" arrangements made through AMI to squash unflattering stories about Trump.\n\nHe first denied that there is a tape of Trump striking his wife in an elevator, which has been rumored to exist.\n\n\"I'm certain it\u2019s not true,\" Cohen said, adding that there have multiple attempts to buy the tape if it did exist.\n\nAnd he said that another story purchased by AMI to kill it about Trump having a love child is also not true, to the best of his knowledge.\n\n\u2014 Jacqueline Thomsen\n\nCohen says he\u2019s never been to Prague\n\n1:46 p.m.\n\nCohen told lawmakers that he has never traveled to Prague.\n\nMcClatchy reported last year that foreign intelligence services had evidence of a mobile phone linked to Cohen pinging cell towers around Prague between August and September 2016.\n\nThe report, which Cohen denied at the time, gave credence to a claim in the controversial Trump-Russia dossier that Cohen as Trump\u2019s lawyer secretly met with Russian government representatives in Prague in August 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Prague,\u201d Cohen said.\n\n\u2014 Morgan Chalfant\n\nCohen says Trump directed him to lie about hush money payment\n\n1:35 p.m.\n\nCohen testified that Trump called him in February 2018 and directed him to mislead the public about the president's knowledge of a hush money payment to adult-film star Daniels.\n\nCohen told lawmakers Trump called him while he was meeting with a reporter in February 2018 to coordinate on public messaging about payments to Daniels, who alleges she had an affair with the president.\n\n\"What did president ask or suggest you say about the payments or reimbursements?\" Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.) asked.\n\n\u201cHe was not knowledgeable of these reimbursements and he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable of my actions,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"He asked you to say that?\" Hill asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma\u2019am,\" Cohen replied.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported in January 2018 that Cohen had paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. The president has denied the affair took place.\n\nTrump has offered shifting explanations about when he knew about the payments, but initially told reporters that he was unfamiliar with the arrangement to pay Daniels.\n\nCohen told lawmakers that his statement issued in February 2018 that he used his own personal funds to pay Daniels and that \"neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was party to the transaction\" or reimbursed him was technically accurate.\n\n\"I purposefully left out Mr. Trump individually from that statement,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"Why did you say it that way?\" Hill said.\n\n\"Because that's what was discussed to do between myself, Mr. Trump and Mr. Weisselberg,\" he said, referencing Trump Organization executive Allen Weisselberg.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance law violations related to the payment to Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also alleged she had an affair with Trump. He said in court documents at the time that he made the payments at Trump's direction.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nCohen says he came up with idea of Trump presidential bid in 2011\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nCohen said that he came up with the idea that Trump should run for president back in 2011.\n\n\u201cI saw a document in a newspaper that said who would you vote for in 2012, 6 percent of the people said they would vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Cohen said\n\n\u201cI said to him, \u2018Mr. Trump look at this\u2019 and he said \u2018well wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u2019 \u201d Cohen said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it all started.\u201d\n\nCohen also said he started the website shouldtrumprun.com in 2011. That site is no longer active.\n\n\u2014 Jacqueline Thomsen\n\nMeadows snaps at Cohen amid questioning: 'Don't give me that bull'\n\n1:24 p.m.\n\nMeadows grew frustrated while pressing Cohen on whether former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean advised Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis on submitting his testimony last minute.\n\nCohen, who denied that he had spoken personally to Dean, said he was working late on his testimony Tuesday night ahead of his public appearance.\n\n\u201cSo you were writing it last night?\u201d Meadows said, thrusting down his papers in a sign of frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that bull.\u201d\n\nCohen, who appeared taken aback by the remark, said he was working with his lawyers to make \u201cedits all the way through the night.\u201d\n\n\"We were working until 11, 12 o\u2019clock last night to finish everything,\" Cohen told Meadows.\n\n\u2014 Olivia Beavers\n\nGOP rep defends Trump against Cohen claim he didn't want to be president\n\n1:00 p.m.\n\nRep. Glenn Grotham (R-Wis.) pushed back against Cohen\u2019s assertion in his opening testimony that Trump had no desire to lead the country and that he campaigned for president to boost the Trump brand.\n\n\u201cI just want to clarify that I dealt with President Trump several times as he was trying to get Wisconsin,\u201d Grotham said. \u201cHe was always confident. He was working very hard. And this idea that somehow he was just running to raise his profile for some future venture, at least in my experience, is preposterous.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI find it offensive when anti-Trump people imply that he didn\u2019t expect to win,\u201d he added.\n\nCohen said in his opening remarks that Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,\" adding that the president \u201cnever expected to win the primary\u201d and \u201cnever expected to win the general election.\"\n\n\u201cThe campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity,\u201d Cohen said.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nCohen says changes were made to testimony about Trump Moscow deal after meeting with Trump lawyers\n\n12:58 p.m.\n\nWhen asked about whether Trump\u2019s personal lawyers made changes to his written 2017 congressional testimony, Cohen replied, \u201cThere were changes made.\u201d\n\nCohen said changes were made to the testimony at a meeting with Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow but he didn\u2019t go into detail about them beyond saying they were about the message regarding how long the discussions about building a Trump property in Moscow went on.\n\n\u201cThere will several changes that were made, including how we were going to handle that message,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nIn November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about the real-estate property discussions. Cohen admitted, among other things, that the talks extended as late as June 2016 \u2014 six months longer than he testified.\n\n\u2014 Morgan Chalfant\n\nCohen says there are other examples of wrongdoing involving Trump that he can't discuss\n\n12:50 p.m.\n\nCohen told lawmakers that he's aware of additional illegal acts President Trump committed that have not been discussed at Wednesday's hearing, but that he could not elaborate because they relate to a Southern District of New York investigation.\n\nCohen estimated that he last spoke with Trump or someone acting on his behalf last fall, though he could not recall a specific date.\n\n\"I would suspect it was within two months post-the raid,\u201d he said, referring to the April 2018 FBI raid of his home, hotel room and office.\n\nAsked what they discussed, Cohen said, \"Unfortunately this topic is actually something that\u2019s being investigated right now by the Southern District of New York, and I\u2019ve been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues.\"\n\nRep.

Why didn\u2019t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked\u2019s office?\" one tweet read.\n\nIn another, Trump claimed that Cohen \"lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.\"\n\nCohen argued in his opening remarks that these tweets clearly show Trump was trying to encourage \"someone to do harm to me and my family.\"\n\nHe also expressed surprise that Trump and his allies would go after him and his family.\n\n\"I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family and unleash his TV lawyer to do the same,\" Cohen said, in what appears to be a reference to the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who said on Wednesday that anyone who believed Cohen's testimony would have to be a \"fool.\"\n\n\u2014 Olivia Beavers\n\nCohen: 'No doubt in my mind' Trump knew he was reimbursing hush money payments\n\n11:00 a.m.\n\nCohen said that there was \"no doubt in my mind\" that Trump knew that he was reimbursing Cohen for a hush money payment made to Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged affair when Trump wrote him a personal check while serving as president.\n\nCommittee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsBrindisi, Lamb recommended for Armed Services, Transportation Committees Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Elijah Cummings's widow, will run for his House seat Former NAACP president to run for Cummings's House seat MORE (D-Md.) asked Cohen if the former lawyer was testifying that Trump \"wrote you a check out of his personal account while he was serving as president of the United States of America to reimburse you for hush money payments?\" Cohen replied that he was.\n\n\"The president claimed he knew nothing about these payments, his ethics filings said he owed nothing to you,\" Cummings continued. \"Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for?\"\n\n\n\n\"There was no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there was no doubt in the mind of the people of the United States of America,\" Cohen replied.\n\n\u2014 Jacqueline Thomsen\n\nCohen offers public apology\n\n10:55 a.m.\n\nCohen was contrite in his testimony, repeatedly noting that he continued working for Trump despite knowledge of what the onetime confidant of the president described as \u201cracist,\u201d illegal and nefarious behavior.\n\nAt the end of his opening statement, Cohen offered an apology to the lawmakers before him and to the American people. Cohen is slated to soon report to prison to serve a three-year sentence for campaign finance violations, making false statements to Congress and other charges.\n\n\u201cOver the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress. And to our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Morgan Chalfant\n\nCohen says Trump had 'no desire' to serve as president\n\n10:50 a.m.\n\nCohen said that Trump had \"no desire\" to lead the country, but instead sought to build his personal brand with his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great,\" Cohen said. \"He had no desire or intention to lead this nation, only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.\"\n\n\"Mr. Trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial in political history,\" Cohen continued. \"He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity.\"\n\nMultiple pundits and observers \u2014 including author Michael Wolff and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough \u2014 have speculated since he took office that Trump did not expect to win the presidency when he ran in 2016.\n\nThe businessman has given every indication he intends to run for a second term in 2020 and held his first campaign rally of the year earlier this month in Texas.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nCohen takes sworn testimony oath\n\n10:29 a.m.\n\nCohen, raising his right hand, swore before the committee that the testimony he was about to give is the \u201cwhole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god.\u201d\n\nCohen answered in the affirmative after Cummings read the oath.\n\nHe has also vowed in his prepared opening remarks to tell the truth, promising to include documentation to help support his claims.\n\n\u2014 Olivia Beavers\n\nJordan paints Cohen hearing as attempt to impeach Trump\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nJordan used his opening statement to disparage the purpose of Wednesday's hearing, painting Cohen as not being a credible witness and the start of Democratic efforts to impeach the president.\n\nThe lawmaker noted that Cohen is the first major witness to appear before the committee since it was taken under Democratic control, describing the president's former fixer solely as \"a convicted felon.\"\n\n\"Your chairmanship will always be identified with this hearing,\" Jordan said to Cummings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"When we legitimize dishonesty we delegitimize this institution,\" the Republican said, referring to Cohen's past lies to Congress. \"We are supposed to pursue the truth, but you have stacked the deck against the truth.\"\n\nHe also claimed that Wednesday's hearing was orchestrated by Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis, highlighting Davis's ties to the Clintons.\n\nAnd Jordan said that the Democrat-lead hearing was designed \"to give a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States, so they can all start their impeachment process.\"\n\n\u2014 Jacqueline Thomsen\n\nCummings says Cohen prepared testimony 'deeply disturbing'\n\n10:20 a.m.\n\nCummings described former Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s prepared testimony as \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d saying it raised \u201cgreat questions\u201d about the legality of President Trump\u2019s conduct while in office.\n\n\u201cThe testimony that Michael Cohen will provide today, ladies and gentlemen, is deeply disturbing and it should be troubling to all Americans,\u201d Cummings said, noting that the public would need to make its own judgments about Cohen\u2019s credibility given his past false statements to Congress.\n\nCummings particularly noted that Cohen, who worked for Trump for roughly a decade, came equipped with evidence in the form of a check signed personally by Trump in August 2017 that repaid him for hush-money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nCohen has pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by orchestrating the payment, which he has admitted was done to prevent negative information from surfacing about Trump during the 2016 campaign. Cohen has said that Trump directed him to make the payments.\n\nTrump has offered shifting explanations for the payments, which Cummings noted, including denying knowledge of them in April and later acknowledging he repaid Cohen but that the payments were a retainer for legal services. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThis new evidence raises a host of troubling legal and ethical concerns about the president\u2019s actions in the White House and before,\u201d Cummings said.\n\nCummings acknowledged that it was a \u201clegitimate question\u201d whether Cohen is a credible witness. Last November, Cohen admitted to lying to the House and Senate intelligence committees about discussions within the Trump Organization to build a Trump property in Moscow and agreed to cooperate in special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSpeier says impeachment inquiry shows 'very strong case of bribery' by Trump Gowdy: I '100 percent' still believe public congressional hearings are 'a circus' Comey: Mueller 'didn't succeed in his mission because there was inadequate transparency' MORE\u2019s investigation.\n\nCohen is slated to begin a three-year prison sentence for the campaign finance violations, false statements and other charges he pleaded guilty to last year.\n\nRepublicans like committee ranking member Jim Jordan (Ohio), a fierce Trump ally, have seized on Cohen\u2019s past lies as reason for him not to be trusted in his public testimony Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe all have to make our own evaluations of the evidence and Cohen\u2019s credibility,\u201d Cummings said in his opening remarks, describing his past lies as an \u201cimportant factor\u201d for lawmakers to weigh.\n\n\u201cBut we must weigh it and we must hear from him,\u201d Cummings added.\n\nCummings signaled that his committee, which has broad oversight powers, would take steps following Cohen\u2019s testimony to get to the bottom of Cohen\u2019s testimony and allegations about the hush-money payments and other matters.\n\n\u201cWe will continue after the day to collect more documents and testimony,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cMr. Cohen\u2019s testimony is the beginning of the process \u2014 not the end.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Morgan Chalfant\n\nMeadows attempts to delay hearing over timing of Cohen's written testimony\n\n10:10 a.m.\n\nAn irate Meadows attempted to postpone Cohen's testimony at the start of the hearing, claiming that Cohen withheld submitting his written testimony until late Tuesday night in violation of committee rules.\n\nMeadows said that Cohen had not submitted his opening statement until about 10 p.m. on Tuesday and that Congress only received excerpts on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It was an intentional effort by this witness and his adviser to once again show his disdain for this body,\" Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said in reference to Cohen's past false statements to Congress.\n\nThe committee voted against delaying the hearing.\n\n\"You\u2019ve made it clear that you don\u2019t want the American people to hear what Mr. Cohen has to say,\" Cummings said, directing his comments toward Meadows and Jordan. \"But the American people have a right to hear him, so we\u2019re going to proceed.\"\n\nJordan pushed back, saying that they \"didn't say stop the hearing, we said postpone it\" so they could receive the written statements and exhibits in accordance with committee rules.\n\n\u2014 Jacqueline Thomsen\n\nCohen arrives\n\n9:59 a.m.\n\nMichael Cohen entered the room just before 10 a.m. He paused for about a minute as a spattering of photographers took pictures of him in the witness chair.

Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon WhitehouseDemocratic senators seek documents on Trump's alleged call for Barr press conference Senate committee advances budget reform plan Bipartisan Enzi-Whitehouse budget bill a very bad fix for deficits MORE (D-R.I.) said that Cohen has an incentive to be truthful with lawmakers, pushing back against GOP criticisms that Cohen is untrustworthy.\n\nWhitehouse noted on Twitter that Cohen's cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors could be imperiled if he's found to have perjured himself during congressional testimony.\n\n\"Looking at prison, all #Cohen\u2019s incentives are to be truthful,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nLooking at prison, all #Cohen\u2019s incentives are to be truthful.https://t.co/2B3IlTT1SP \u2014 Sheldon Whitehouse (@SenWhitehouse) February 27, 2019\n\nThe senator responded directly to a tweet from Trump, who repeated his claim that Cohen is lying to secure a lighter prison sentence.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) noted in a tweet of his own that Cohen has agreed to testify under oath, whereas Trump has not, saying that gives the former attorney's words additional weight.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nCrowds swarm Capitol Hill ahead of Cohen appearance\n\n9:40 a.m.\n\nThe scene outside the House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing room was chaotic ahead of Cohen\u2019s testimony Wednesday morning.\n\nThrongs of reporters, cameramen, photographers and onlookers from the public flocked the hallways of the Rayburn House Office building.\n\nCohen\u2019s attorney and spokesman Lanny Davis could be seen sitting in the front row behind Cohen\u2019s seat a half hour before the hearing was slated to begin.\n\n\u2014 Morgan Chalfant\n\nGiuliani: Anyone who believes 'pathetic' Cohen is a 'fool'\n\n8:05 a.m.\n\nGiuliani, who currently serves as Trump's personal attorney, told The Washington Post on Wednesday that one would have to be a \"fool\" to believe Cohen's testimony.\n\n\"It\u2019s pathetic. This is a lawyer who tapped [sic] his own client when he claimed he was being loyal. If you believe him you are a fool,\" Giuliani told the news outlet.\n\n\"Let\u2019s see if these Democrats want to ask about his many crimes that have nothing to do with anyone but his coterie of business associates with questionable connections,\" he added.\n\nGiuliani suggested Cohen \"may be\" tied to Russian organized crime and raised Cohen's father-in-law's past criminal conviction. The former New York City mayor has made similar comments before, prompting allegations of witness tampering.\n\nGiuliani said last year that Trump and his legal team had no concerns about Cohen cooperating with prosecutors, but he has since shifted his tone to repeatedly slam the longtime Trump Organization as untrustworthy.\n\n\u2014 Brett Samuels\n\nTrump blasts Cohen on Twitter\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nPresident Trump early Wednesday sought to distance himself from Cohen, slamming his ex-lawyer in a tweet between meetings with Vietnamese officials and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
