    "content": "The future of Obamacare again falls on the shoulders of John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy .\nAs the Obama administration and Obamacare opponents prepare for another Supreme Court showdown Wednesday , both sides are tailoring their arguments to win over the chief justice , who cast the saving vote for the Affordable Care Act in 2012 , and Kennedy , the perennial swing vote on the Supreme Court .\nThe court is likely to split largely along ideological lines with Kennedy or Roberts casting crucial votes . Some Obamacare backers are even making a pitch to Justice Antonin Scalia to look at a broad reading of the law , although winning him over seems like a long shot .\nThe challengers \u2014 four Virginia residents who don \u2019 t want to abide by the mandate that Americans buy health insurance \u2014 argue that the Obama administration is illegally giving out Obamacare subsidies . They say a phrase in the text of the massive law \u2014 that subsidies go to \u201c exchanges established by the state \u201d \u2014 only allows the money to go to residents of the 16 states , plus Washington , D.C. , that set up their own insurance exchanges . If the plaintiffs prevail , more than 7 million people now receiving the subsidies in 34 states would lose them .\nThe opponents \u2019 lawyer , Michael A. Carvin of the law firm Jones Day , will argue that Congress all along intended to direct the subsidies through the state-run exchange as an incentive for the states to take on that task instead of leaving it to the federal government . The plaintiffs point to early versions of health reform legislation , one considered in the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , that tied together subsidies and a state \u2019 s insurance reforms .\nThe first goal of Solicitor General Don Verrilli is to take apart the challengers \u2019 narrative . Several Democratic members of Congress who wrote the law told the court that there was never a plan to use the subsidies as an incentive to states . Of all the congressional debate over Obamacare in 2009 and 2010 , no one considered that Democrats were setting up a scheme in which blue states would get a benefit that most red states wouldn \u2019 t accept , the government will say .\n\u201c If there was any ambiguity that not everyone [ would be eligible for subsidies ] there would have been a war among the Democratic Caucus that you all could not have helped but noticed , \u201d said John McDonough , who was a senior health staffer on the HELP Committee at the time .\nThe Obama administration hopes to set up a scenario in which the justices agree it \u2019 s clear that Congress intended for subsidies to go to everyone . That would make it much harder for them to rule that the subsidies must end merely based on the one clause . It \u2019 s an argument that could resonate with Roberts and Kennedy .\nHowever , the law \u2019 s critics are hoping that the two justices do precisely the opposite : that they find the phrase about the state exchanges so clear-cut that they don \u2019 t embark on a quest to sort out what Congress intended .\nBoth the chief justice and Justice Kennedy have shown textualist sympathies , have shown that they care about the parsing of statutes .\n\u201c Both the chief justice and Justice Kennedy have shown textualist sympathies , have shown that they care about the parsing of statutes , \u201d said Case Western University law professor Jonathan Adler , who was one of the first to argue that the subsidies were not authorized .\nEven if the text of the law is not perfectly crystal clear , the Obama administration plans to argue , the federal agencies should receive deference to sort out details and ambiguities . That \u2019 s a concept that Neal Katyal , a former acting solicitor general who defended the 2012 health care challenge for the Obama administration , says is favored by the court \u2019 s conservative justices . In this case , the IRS is the agency that has been responsible for the subsidies , which come in the form of tax credits .\n\u201c I think it will be particularly hard for the conservatives on the court to adopt the challengers \u2019 position on this issue , \u201d said Katyal , who is representing hospitals in this case .\nHowever , opponents of the law say it would be a mistake to let an agency decide to offer tax credits , which affect tax refunds and equate to direct payments out of the U.S. Treasury .\n\u201c Decisions of a certain magnitude are not the sort of thing that Congress would delegate to an agency , \u201d Adler said . \u201c It would really be quite something to conclude that Congress had delegated the decision whether to offer tax credits to the IRS . \u201d\nOne argument the White House and its allies are directing at Roberts : Ruling for the challengers would cause chaos in the insurance system \u2014 an idea some lawyers believe will worry the chief justice .\nSeveral economic groups , health industries and think tanks that support the Affordable Care Act have released reports outlining the damage that would be done if the court rules against the White House . The Urban Institute says stopping the subsidies would increase the number of uninsured by 8.2 million and eliminate $ 28.8 billion in tax credits in 2016 . They further outline ripple effects that would create chaos in insurance markets .\nRepublican supporters of King are trying to address the chaos theory , too \u2014 and signal to the justices that they \u2019 ll prevent it . Three prominent Republican senators , including Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , wrote in a Washington Post op-ed this weekend that they are working on plans to allow the subsidies to continue on a transitional basis while the GOP-led Congress works out an Obamacare alternative . They haven \u2019 t spelled out details , and it \u2019 s not clear how much support they have even among fellow Republicans .\nSome legal experts sympathetic to the challengers are similarly trying to downplay the significance of the case or its political fallout .\n\u201c The prior Obamacare case was momentous , \u201d said Georgetown University law professor Nicholas Rosenkranz . \u201c A Justice Kennedy or a Justice Roberts will bend over backwards to avoid concluding that Congress violated the Constitution . \u2026 This case is just about what the words of the statute mean . \u2026 There \u2019 s nothing at all daunting about this . \u201d\nThe Obama administration , in its formal brief , focuses on three specific rulings in which Roberts appears to have played a role . The most obvious , cited at least three times , was the chief justice \u2019 s decisive vote to uphold the health law in the 2012 case challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate .\nGovernment lawyers also rely on a 6-3 decision Roberts wrote last year , rejecting use of a federal chemical weapons law to prosecute a Pennsylvania woman who used toxic chemicals to attempt to poison her husband \u2019 s mistress .\nIn that case , the chief justice effectively added some more language to the statute to avoid what appeared to be an unintended result \u2014 the same kind of reading Obamacare defenders want the justices to adopt in the King case .\n\u201c The notion that some things \u2018 go without saying \u2019 applies to legislation just as it does to everyday life , \u201d Roberts wrote in the mistress-poisoning case .\nObamacare supporters say the chief justice doesn \u2019 t have to resort to the same degree of statutory surgery to side with the White House in this case .\nBackers of the health care law have other things to worry about , though . They are nervous that Roberts might fall into a pattern of punting tough decisions to Congress even when it \u2019 s virtually certain that perpetually gridlocked lawmakers won \u2019 t act .\nIn a landmark ruling on the Voting Rights Act two years ago , Roberts struck down a key formula that subjected parts or all of 15 states to advance clearance of voting-related changes by the Justice Department or a federal court . The chief justice argued that if Congress didn \u2019 t like the decision , it could devise a new formula more suited to the times .\n\u201c He seemed to suggest it would be no big deal for Congress to come up with a new coverage formula to determine which states needed extra voting supervision , \u201d said University of California at Irvine law professor Rick Hasen . \u201c He knew full well that Congress was not going to do that . \u201d\nRoberts acted similarly in a decision last year striking down aggregate campaign contribution limits , repeatedly suggesting that Congress could fix any problems the court \u2019 s decision might create .\nHasen said it \u2019 s implausible that Roberts is unaware that Congress is struggling simply to fund government agencies , let alone hammer out politically polarizing legislation .\n\u201c Either the chief justice is quite naive about how politics in Washington works , or he \u2019 s very smart and he likes to act like he \u2019 s naive , \u201d Hasen said , adding , \u201c I tend to believe he \u2019 s really smart . \u201d\nThe government is also trying to appeal to Kennedy \u2014 and to a lesser extent Roberts \u2014 via their interest in protecting the states from being pushed around by the federal government .\nIf Congress had aimed to put some muscle on states considering refusing to set up exchanges , then lawmakers were rather duplicitous , the Obama administration argues . It urges the justices to reject a reading of the law where such a consequential \u201c threat \u201d was obscurely tucked away in a giant piece of legislation .\nTwenty-two states , most led by Democrats , wrote a friend-of-the-court brief , saying that they never interpreted the law to say that setting up an exchange was a precondition for subsidies .\n\u201c The justices focused on federalism , Anthony Kennedy for example , will find very persuasive the argument from the states that \u2026 the states never got that message , \u201d said Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center .\nObama administration lawyers hang part of this argument on a case that might particularly appeal to Roberts .
