Or , to be more specific , there \u2019 s evidence that when weighing Mr. Trump versus rival Ted Cruz , many Republican leaders think Senator Cruz the greater danger . That \u2019 s an implicit admission that they \u2019 re beginning to think Trump might not be , you know , so bad .\nLet \u2019 s go to the list : Earlier this month , right-leaning New York Times columnist David Brooks unloaded on Cruz , saying the Texas senator \u2019 s speeches are full of a sort of \u201c pagan brutalism. \u201d Since then , two former Republican Senate majority leaders , Trent Lott and Bob Dole , have indicated they think a Cruz nomination would be cataclysmic for the GOP and lead to widespread losses down the ticket .\nThen this week , the Republican governor of Iowa , Terry Branstad , said flatly that he hopes anyone but Cruz wins his state \u2019 s first-in-the-nation caucuses . True , Governor Branstad cited Cruz \u2019 s opposition to ethanol subsidies , crucial to Iowa \u2019 s economy , as the reason for his opposition . But the open and vehement nature of the anti-endorsement indicated a high level of political enmity .\n\u201c It is no surprise that the establishment is in full panic mode , \u201d Cruz told reporters after hearing of this news .\nWhy does this imply anything about Trump ? Well , the Iowa caucuses are now less than two weeks away . The New Hampshire primary is within three . The primary season moves quickly through South Carolina and other states after that .

The Republican establishment is not a cohesive entity chaired by the ghost of Nelson Rockefeller . Many GOP journalists and public intellectuals continue to worry that Trump , with his belligerent populism , will push the party so far from its small-government roots that it will become unrecognizable .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re seeing is the attempt at the normalization of Trump on the right , and defining conservatism down .
