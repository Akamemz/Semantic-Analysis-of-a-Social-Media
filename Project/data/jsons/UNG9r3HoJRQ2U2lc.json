But he has a similar disheveled populist anti-fashion to go along with an extensive track record of support for labor unions and skepticism of the forces of globalization .\nAnd as a white dude from Ohio , he 's ideally suited in demographic terms to help Clinton stem her losses of working-class whites in the Midwest \u2014 a key area of weakness vis-\u00e0-vis Donald Trump .\nBut there 's a huge problem . Ohio has a Republican governor , so creating a vacancy would cost Democrats a Senate seat . Elizabeth Warren has the same problem . So does Tammy Baldwin . And Cory Booker . And Debbie Stabenow .\nFear of losing a Senate seat with a VP pick is n't unique to the 2016 election , of course . But with polarization in Congress steadily rising , it 's an increasingly important consideration \u2014 particularly in a year when Democrats are hoping to retake a Senate .\nAnd Clinton 's problem is that Democrats right now are doing terribly in terms of winning state and local elections . The Southwestern swing states of Nevada and New Mexico are in Republican hands . So are Iowa and Ohio , the Midwestern swingers . So is Florida .
