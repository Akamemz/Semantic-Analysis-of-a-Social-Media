    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : In one of the first closely watched primaries of the 2014 election season , the speaker of the North Carolina House , Thom Tillis , has won the Republican U.S. Senate nomination . He will now face Democratic Senator Kay Hagan in November in a race that could decide which party controls the Senate . The Republican primary drew national attention as it pitted Tillis , who was backed by much of the Republican establishment , against candidates with close ties to the tea party and the religious right . Some analysts described the primary as a proxy war in the battle for the soul of the Republican Party . Tillis had received endorsements from big-name Republicans , including Mitt Romney , Jeb Bush and Karl Rove , as well as the National Rifle Association . One of his challengers , tea party favorite Greg Brannon , was backed by Senator Rand Paul , while another challenger , Mark Harris , a Baptist minister , drew support from Mike Huckabee . In the end , Tillis received 45 percent of the vote , enough to prevent a runoff . As speaker of the North Carolina House , Tillis was a frequent target of the Moral Monday protests over the past two years .\nAMY GOODMAN : Primaries were also held Tuesday in North Carolina to determine who will sit on the state Supreme Court . The races have gained national attention because millions of dollars from outside groups have poured into the state to back conservative candidates . North Carolina is one of 22 states where judges on higher courts are elected rather than appointed .\nTo talk more about North Carolina , we \u2019 re joined by Chris Kromm in Raleigh . He is executive director of the Institute for Southern Studies .\nLet \u2019 s go first to the Thom Tillis race . Talk about the significance of what happened there . It is being seen as a bellwether for the Republican Party all over the country , Chris .\nCHRIS KROMM : Well , North Carolina is a bellwether state , and this race , I think , just drove that home . Two of the big storylines for me are , one , this escalating arms race of big money that \u2019 s increasingly deciding , including primary elections\u2014we saw about $ 2 million coming in from outside groups that really wanted to back Thom Tillis as the establishment candidate for this Republican primary in an effort to topple Kay Hagan , the sitting Democrat , and eventually , like you said , win control of the U.S. Senate . So , Tillis was aiming for this 40 percent number . That \u2019 s how much he had to get to avoid a runoff .\nBut it also pointed to another big storyline , which is the civil war that Republicans are facing with the tea party . And going into this race , it wasn \u2019 t at all clear that Tillis , even with this establishment backing , really could pull it off . And in the end , he did . He got 45 percent . But it does raise the question , if those kind of right-wing challengers had coalesced around one candidate , maybe we would be seeing a costly runoff .\nBut just because Tillis is the establishment candidate , of course , doesn \u2019 t mean that he is a moderate candidate . He has also called himself the leader of the conservative revolution in North Carolina , which is why he was a target of the Moral Monday protests . And he \u2019 s on record\u2014you \u2019 ve talked a lot in this show about climate change . Well , in a recent debate , he was asked flatly if he believed in the science of climate change , if that was a fact , and he said no . But that \u2019 s an example of , I think , how the overall debate has shifted to the right . He doesn \u2019 t agree in a minimum wage . He thinks that \u2019 s an artificial standard that \u2019 s being put on business . He promoted the anti-gay-marriage amendment in North Carolina . Kind of a series of positions that really puts him in the rightward camp . So even though he had a tea party challenge , it shows how much the political debate has shifted to the right in North Carolina .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Could you talk about\u2014Chris , you mentioned the amount of outside money in this primary election race . Could you talk about who some of his backers , Thom Tillis \u2019 s backers , were in this election ?\nCHRIS KROMM : We saw two big players coming into the primary . One , nationally , was Americans for Prosperity . They have spent more money\u2014this is the Koch brothers \u2019 tea party group . They have spent more money attacking Kay Hagan than any other candidate across the country . And that started last fall . I mean , they \u2019 ve just been blanketing , a carpet bombing of the state of these attack ads , kind of trying to soften up support for Kay Hagan . Then , on the other side , you saw millions of dollars \u2019 worth of ads supporting Tillis to really make sure he could survive this primary challenge from the tea party right . And again , there was about $ 1.6 million that came from Karl Rove \u2019 s group , American Crossroads . Last year they had set up this initiative called the Conservative Victory Fund , the whole idea being that they \u2019 d try to get the most electable candidates to face off in these general elections . So they wanted to make sure very early that you got somebody like Tillis , who is considered the more establishment candidate , who is going to survive the primary and come out in the end . And that outside money , I think , in the end\u2014you saw how close that vote was in the primary\u2014I think you can really say that outside money played a big role .\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to comments of North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis in 2011 about residents on public assistance .\nSPEAKER THOM TILLIS : What we have to do is find a way to divide and conquer the people who are on assistance . We have to show respect for that woman who has cerebral palsy and had no choice in her condition , that needs help and that we should help . And we need to get those folks to look down at these people who choose to get into a condition that makes them dependent on the government , and say , at some point , \u201c You are on your own . We may end up taking care of those babies , but we \u2019 re not going to take care of you. \u201d And we \u2019 ve got to start having that serious discussion . It won \u2019 t happen next year\u2014wrong time , because it \u2019 s going to be politically charged . One of the reasons why I may never run for another elected office is because some of these things may just get me railroaded out of town .\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Thom Tillis in 2011 , the North Carolina House speaker . And let \u2019 s go back to that clip from the North Carolina Republican Senate debate you just mentioned , when all the Republican candidates vying for their party \u2019 s nomination said climate change was not a fact .\nAMY GOODMAN : So there you have it on both of these issues . Chris Kromm , if you could address both ? And talk about the ads , which were very clear in talking about Thom Tillis as center-right .\nCHRIS KROMM : Well , and that \u2019 s the thing , is it \u2019 s really been a difficulty trying to position Tillis , given that he had to run somewhat moderate , distinguish himself from the tea party challengers , but also had to be conservative to try to win over some of that support and also own up to his record . That clip about public assistance became somewhat infamous . I mean , rarely does a politician openly embrace a strategy where they say , \u201c We need to divide and conquer. \u201d Usually they don \u2019 t claim that kind of strategy , kind of harkens back to the Southern strategy that Richard Nixon mapped out for the South , you know , 40 , 50 years ago .\nYou know , it really shows an attitude towards the public sector . Another place where that \u2019 s been reflected is in public schools . Here , North Carolina had always been considered a leader nationally with its public schools , and been a steady dismantling under Tillis \u2019 s leadership , cutting teacher pay , proposing the expansion of charter schools , vouchers for private schools . And so , it \u2019 s kind of this view that you would more associate with a tea party perspective about that the government can do no good .\nAnd on climate change , you \u2019 ll notice they didn \u2019 t even say human-caused climate change ; it was whether or not climate change at all is considered a fact . And he said no to that . And this comes out at the very same time , as your first guest pointed out , we have this National Climate Assessment , which showed that the Southeast is going to be one of the most intensely affected regions . The Mid-Atlantic is going to be a hotspot for sea-level rise , and here you have a candidate , who \u2019 s establishment Republican candidate , denying that the very existence of climate change is a phenomenon .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Chris Kromm , I also want to ask you about the judicial races in North Carolina . This is a TV ad that ran regularly in the lead-up to yesterday \u2019 s primary .\nJUSTICE FOR ALL NC AD : We want judges to protect us . When child molesters sued to stop electronic monitoring of their locations , a law that let us track child molesters near schools , playgrounds , daycare centers , Supreme Court Justice Robin Hudson sided with the predators . Hudson cited a child molester \u2019 s right to privacy and took the side of the convicted molesters . Justice Robin Hudson , not tough on child molesters , not fair to victims .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Chris Kromm , could you talk about the group behind this ad , who \u2019 s funding them , and also about the fact that judges are being elected in North Carolina , because that \u2019 s perhaps not something that most\u2014a lot of people are familiar with , that judges are also elected ?\nCHRIS KROMM : Well , this is becoming one of the key battlegrounds for elections . We do have judicial elections in North Carolina , and this year is going to be one of the biggest . Four Supreme Court races are up , seven total on\u2014statewide , with the court of appeals , as well . And this has become a big money magnet for these outside groups , because they have a very big interest , including groups that are backed by corporations that often have business before the Supreme Court .\nThe group that ran that particular ad , which has been widely denounced and condemned\u2014even some conservative commentators have said it \u2019 s one of the most despicable ads they \u2019 ve seen , that it \u2019 s based on lies , roundly condemned\u2014was run by this super PAC called Justice for All NC . It doesn \u2019 t really exist as an organization . It hasn \u2019 t filed anywhere as a corporate entity . We went to go visit its office , and it turned out to be a UPS mailbox in a Raleigh strip mall . What it mostly is a funnel for money , and it \u2019 s gotten $ 900,000 this year from the Republican State Leadership Committee , the Washington , D.C. , super PAC , which has taken a special interest in trying to get conservative justices elected in states like North Carolina . They were a big funder in 2012 , helping elect a guy called Paul Newby , who is running for re-election . They had over $ 2 million worth of ads running for him this year .\nWe saw in the primary an attempt to unseat a sitting justice . These are nonpartisan races , but she \u2019 s a sitting\u2014a registered Democrat , Robin Hudson\u2014big money trying to unseat her and primary her out . She survived that challenge , and I think , in part , it was because these ads were so nasty that there was a bit of a backfire , backlash , against big money trying to call this race .\nAMY GOODMAN : And what do you think this means for November , the big race between Kay Hagan and Thom Tillis ?\nCHRIS KROMM : Well , I think between that U.S. Senate race , you \u2019 ve got these Supreme Court races , state Supreme Court races\u2014you \u2019 re going to see all records shattered in terms of the amount of big money coming into the state , a lot of it from these national super PACs , some of them with donors that you can \u2019 t even trace . Increasingly , this is going to be the money magnet . And that really points to the fact that North Carolina is this key battleground state . You have Moral Monday , you have the rightward turn , and big money sees it as critical that they spend to try to shape the political outcome and direction of the state .\nAMY GOODMAN : Chris Kromm , I want to thank you for being with us , executive director of the Institute for Southern Studies , publisher of Facing South and Southern Exposure magazine .\nThat does it for the show . I \u2019 ll be speaking in Stowe , Vermont , on May 17th . \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! is hiring three part-time video news production fellows .
