The Texas senator is notoriously disliked within his own party , and is the only other candidate with favorability ratings as bad or worse than the Republican front-runner . Still , party leaders have rallied halfheartedly around Cruz , the last remaining obstacle between Trump and the nomination .

Despite a strong showing in early April , when he won Wisconsin after a week of Trump insulting his wife \u2019 s looks , Cruz lost every single primary to the New York billionaire in the contests afterward , culminating in a string of humiliating losses throughout the Northeast . In the past few days , he \u2019 s pulled out all the stops in Indiana , preemptively picking Carly Fiorina to be his running mate and blanketing the state with his surrogates . But the Hoosier State just isn \u2019 t buying what Cruz is selling . The latest polls show Trump winning by an average 10.8 points in Indiana , and his potential voter base is still rising nationally : according to the newest NBC News/SurveyMonkey weekly tracking poll , Trump is up to 56 percent support among Republicans across the country , a six-point jump from just a week before . Even worse for Cruz , a new Gallup poll show that his unfavorability ratings are on the rise and have recently surpassed Trump \u2019 s .
