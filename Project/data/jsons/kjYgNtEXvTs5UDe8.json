    "content": "The full text of the deal has not been made public , but Trump \u2019 s team and Chinese officials confirmed that the president agreed to scale back some tariffs in exchange for China buying about $ 200 billion more of U.S. goods in the next two years and opening up to U.S. financial firms .\nTrump , at least politically . He can say he made a deal , even it \u2019 s limited . It by no means fulfills all the objectives Trump set out to achieve in resetting the trade relationship with China . But he and his team are already spinning this as Trump keeping yet another campaign promise , even in the midst of Democrats trying to impeach him . News of the deal made the front pages of major newspapers and was mentioned on TV . He can trumpet the deal particularly to farmers and manufacturing workers hit hard by the trade war . The China deal ( and the recently agreed-upon U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal ) also make it likely the U.S. economy will grow at 2 percent or more next year , avoiding a recession and helping Trump \u2019 s reelection chances .\nFarmers . China has committed to buying a record amount of U.S. agricultural products next year , surpassing the prior record of about $ 26 billion in 2012 . U.S. officials say China has agreed to buy $ 32 billion of agricultural products , though Trump says China will probably \u201c hit $ 50 billion. \u201d The Chinese refuse to utter that exact figure , but they have agreed to bump up purchases , and they know Trump wants headlines saying it \u2019 s the \u201c most ever \u201d even if it \u2019 s not quite $ 50 billion . This will be a much-needed injection of cash for farmers , who have been pounded by China \u2019 s retaliatory tariffs despite a program Trump set up to compensate them for losses . Farm bankruptcies are up 24 percent from last year and farm debt is projected to reach a record high , according to the U.S. Farm Bureau . But farmers who voted for Trump before are likely to return to him again after this deal .\nApple and other tech companies . Apple stock soared Friday , even as the overall market was flat . Tech companies like Apple are some of the biggest beneficiaries of this \u201c phase one \u201d deal because they will not be hit by tariffs . Trump had planned to put tariffs on cellphones , laptops and other popular tech products made in China and shipped to the United States on Dec. 15 , but this deal scraps those plans entirely . This is a reminder that certain U.S. companies have quietly managed to avoid most of the tariffs , even as others suffered .\nWalmart and other retailers . Trump scaled back ( or canceled ) tariffs on the most popular items that Americans buy in stores , a massive relief for major U.S. retailers such as Walmart who were trying to figure out how to pass on the higher costs to consumers next year . The Dec. 15 tariffs on toys and tech products aren \u2019 t happening now , and the tariffs enacted in September on many clothing products ( shoes , coats , etc . ) were cut in half from 15 percent to 7.5 percent . Many retailers were able to keep prices down this holiday season because some shipments arrived before the tariffs went into effect , but it would have been much harder to avoid price hikes in 2020 . Now that \u2019 s not an issue .\nWall Street investors . The S & P 500 index is on track for a total return of around 29 percent this year . That would make this the best year for stocks since 2013 and one of the best years of all time . Stocks did fall sharply at the end of last year , but much of that pain has been forgotten after the rebound . Trump loves touting stock market highs \u2014 he did it again Friday after this deal sent stocks to a record close on Thursday . About half of Americans have at least some money in the stock market .\nJPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial companies . One of the biggest breakthroughs in the deal is China finally allowing U.S. banks and credit card companies to enter China on their own without having to partner with a local Chinese company . This has been on the wish list of big American banks for years . JPMorgan Chase already started the groundwork this summer to open in China in anticipation of this deal .\nBusiness leaders . Chief executives of just about every major U.S. company have been urging Trump to strike a deal soon . On Thursday , shortly after Trump gave his final sign-off , he met with the heads of Cummins , Stanley Black & Decker and Union Pacific , who welcomed the deal . Trump frequently claims his tariffs are paid by China , but that \u2019 s not true . U.S. companies have been footing the bill ( and sometimes passing costs on to consumers ) . And that bill so far has been $ 88 billion , one of the largest tax increases in U.S. history , according to the right-leaning Tax Foundation . This deal lowers that burden a bit and , importantly , signals Trump is unlikely to ramp up tariffs further in 2020 .\nThe Chinese government . China didn \u2019 t have to give too much here , and its leaders played Trump skillfully at the end , refusing to confirm there was a deal for hours after the White House leaked there was one . China did agree to buy about $ 200 billion more of U.S. agriculture , energy and manufactured goods , but it was planning to do most of that anyway . It had even offered around that level of purchases in mid-2018 . The biggest concession China made in this deal is to agree to penalties if it doesn \u2019 t hold up its end of the bargain , but there is a long process the United States is supposed to go through before imposing punitive tariffs . In the meantime , Chinese leaders can say they got Trump to roll back some tariffs .\nPeter Navarro , Stephen K. Bannon and China \u201c hawks. \u201d This deal does little to fundamentally change China \u2019 s ambitious \u201c Made in China 2025 \u201d plans . Trump \u2019 s had many trade advisers like Navarro urging him to keep the tariffs on and push China for a bigger deal that would include China committing to no longer subsidize key industries and steal U.S. trade secrets . Instead , Trump scaled back tariffs and settled for a much less ambitious agreement . Trump promises there will be a \u201c phase two \u201d after the election , but many fear this will end up being a one-and-done deal .\nTrump \u2019 s \u201c MAGA \u201d trade agenda . The China deal may be a win for Trump politically , but his goal of forcing China to overhaul its economic policies did not happen here . China remains a power player and its \u201c Made in China 2025\u2033 plan is still moving ahead . China also did not agree to scale back any of its government subsidies for industries like steel . While the latest trade data shows a small reduction in the trade deficit with China , the U.S. trade deficit with other nations ( especially in southeast Asia ) is growing .\nBankrupt farmers . Some farmers didn \u2019 t make it to see the gains from this deal after two brutal years for agriculture . In addition to a spike in farm bankruptcies , farmer suicides are on the rise and now exceed veteran suicide rates .\nDemocrats . The \u201c phase one \u201d China deal is part of a string of positive news that is causing an upswing in markets and the economic outlook for 2020 . A recession looks unlikely now . Trade was the biggest concern , economists said , and that \u2019 s mostly off the table now . It \u2019 s going to be harder to run against Trump . Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) tried to cast this deal as Trump \u201c selling out \u201d to China , but it is going to be easier for Trump to swat away those attacks , especially if farm purchases set records .\nU.S. companies still facing tariffs . Trump still has tariffs in place on about $ 370 billion of Chinese imports . That includes hefty 25 percent tariffs on many parts used in manufacturing , especially for autos . Those tariffs look like they are going to stay in place for a long time . Many small and midsized businesses have been hit the hardest since they have less ability to shift production to Thailand or Vietnam .\nHuawei . The Chinese tech giant has become the poster child of Trump \u2019 s anger against China . Huawei has been accused of spying on the U.S. government and U.S. companies via Hauwei phones and tech products . Trump heavily restricted Hauwei \u2019 s operations . The Chinese government tried to intervene numerous times , but Trump mostly held firm . Huawei told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 this week that the company may need two or three years to recover from Trump \u2019 s actions . The phase one deal does not address Huawei \u2019 s situation .\nChina \u2019 s economy . China was already facing a slowing economy before the trade war began . Trump \u2019 s tariffs exacerbated the pain . While there is relief that he isn \u2019 t going forward with tariffs on all Chinese products , as he had planned to do Dec. 15 , Trump has still kept in place tariffs on nearly $ 370 billion worth of imports . Even more importantly , there is evidence that some companies shifted their supply chains out of China to other countries . That business , while modest as a share of China \u2019 s total economy , is unlikely to return .\nBarack Obama and George W. Bush . There will be debate for years about whether Trump \u2019 s trade war was worth it and whether he achieved enough from the deal . But there \u2019 s agreement that Trump changed the conversation about China . There was bipartisan support to go after China for unfair business practices , and Trump seized on that in a way that his two predecessors did not .",
