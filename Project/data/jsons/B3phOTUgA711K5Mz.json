The RNC had sued over its public records request for all work-related emails sent to or received by Clinton 's former aide , Bryan Pagliano , between 2009 and 2013 , the years of Clinton 's tenure as America 's top diplomat . The lawsuit also pressed for other State Department records from the Clinton era .\nThe RNC 's filing said lawyers for the agency had informed them in discussions that `` the State Department has represented that no responsive records exist '' for any Pagliano emails . Pagliano was hired at the agency after reportedly setting up Clinton 's server in 2009 , but the lack of any official State Department emails raises the question whether he limited his email traffic using a private account , much like Clinton did during her four years as secretary , or whether his government emails were deleted .\nA State Department official said Monday that the agency possessed emails from Pagliano from the period after Clinton 's term had ended , when he continued to work as a technology contractor .\nAgency spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau then added Monday evening that some Pagliano emails dating from Clinton 's tenure had been recovered from agency officials ' files and turned over to other organizations , including Senate investigators .\n`` We have previously produced through FOIA and to Congress emails sent and received by Mr. Pagliano during Secretary Clinton 's tenure , '' Trudeau said in a public statement .
