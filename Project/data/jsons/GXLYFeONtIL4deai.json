''\nSince those lung illnesses overwhelmingly involve black-market marijuana products , the lesson from the outbreak is exactly the opposite of the one the Journal draws . The CDC 's map of cases shows they are concentrated in states where marijuana remains illegal for recreational use , including Florida , Illinois ( where legal recreational sales do not begin until next week ) , Minnesota , New York , Pennsylvania , Texas , and Utah . The one major exception is California , where illegal dealers still account for nearly three-quarters of the market , thanks to heavy taxes , licensing delays , onerous regulations , and local bans .\nThe CDC itself highlights the dangers of THC vapes obtained from `` informal sources like friends , family , or in-person or online dealers . '' In a CDC survey reported last month , 96 percent of patients who developed respiratory symptoms after vaping THC said they had obtained the products `` informally . '' While two people in Oregon died after vaping THC cartridges they said they had bought from state-licensed shops , those are exceptions to the general pattern . The main problem is a black market in which consumers do not know the provenance and composition of the products they are buying .\nIn a legal market , it is much easier to guard against potential hazards . Legal manufacturers tell consumers the ingredients in their vapes , and they are liable for fraud if they lie . Marijuana regulators in Colorado , Oregon , and Washington have banned the use of vitamin E acetate , a cutting and thickening agent strongly implicated in the lung injuries . State-licensed laboratories in places where marijuana is legal can test products for that ingredient and other potentially harmful additives or contaminants . Vitamin E acetate , which the CDC has found in nearly all of the lung fluid samples from patients it has tested , is a relatively new additive that started showing up in illegal THC cartridges this year , which coincides with the recent outbreak .\nThe Journal 's reasoning , in short , is completely backward .
