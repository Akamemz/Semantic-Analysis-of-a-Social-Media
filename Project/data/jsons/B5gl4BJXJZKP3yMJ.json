Rick Scott said he's \"already won the race two times.\" | Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images Elections Scott blasts Nelson over count in Florida Senate race\n\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott said Sunday that he's won his closely contested Senate race against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and that his opponent is \"committing fraud\" in an effort to steal the race from him and is a \"sore loser.\"\n\n\"Sen. Nelson is trying to commit fraud to win this election,\" Scott told host Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFlorida's Senate race is one of three statewide contests headed to an automatic recount, after the unofficial deadline for counties to report results passed at noon Saturday. Scott's lead over Nelson has narrowed since election night. Before the recount was ordered, he remained in front by just over 12,000 votes as Democrat-rich counties like Broward County continued to report additional numbers.\n\nScott repeated his allegations Sunday, without evidence, that fraud is behind the increase in votes for Nelson; both Scott and President Donald Trump have accused Democrats of trying to \"steal\" the election.\n\nScott\u2019s comments, stopping short of actually accusing Nelson of committing fraud directly, concern two issues that surfaced after Election Day.\n\nIn one case, Nelson\u2019s team of lawyers objected to Palm Beach County\u2019s election canvassing board from canceling a ballot cast by a noncititzen, who is barred from voting. In another case, Nelson\u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to allow all absentee ballots to count, including those where the signature on the mail-in envelope doesn\u2019t match the signature of the voter in file. The signature-match rule is designed to prevent people from fraudulently casting a ballot on behalf of another, but the rule had led to tens of thousands of ballots cast by lawful voters to be canceled \u2014 including former Congressman and 2016 US Senate candidate Patrick Murphy.\n\nThe governor also said he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to look into potential fraud.
