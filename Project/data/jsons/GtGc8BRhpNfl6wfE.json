Trump called it a movement , not a campaign .\nHe drew enthusiastic crowds to rallies where people cheered him for \u201c just saying what everybody \u2019 s thinking. \u201d Critics labeled him misogynistic , ill-informed , uncouth , unpresidential , a racist , a hypocrite , a demagogue and a sexual predator , all accusations he denied .\nIt took Trump , 70 , little more than 10 months to vanquish 16 other candidates and become the first major party nominee since General Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s to have no government experience . He drew a record number of votes in primary contests but in so doing created a rift in the party .\nThen he squared off against Clinton , 69 , in a race marked by controversies that included upheaval in his staff , charges he had groped women , and his claim , never supported , that Clinton and the media had rigged the election against him .\nHe shocked many by saying he might not accept the election result if he lost , repudiating a U.S. tradition of peaceful government transition . He said that as president he would investigate Clinton for her use of email while secretary of state . He vowed to send her to jail .\nHis campaign took a scandalous turn in October with the release of a 2005 video in which Trump , unaware he was being recorded , told a television entertainment reporter that he liked to kiss women without invitation and that , because he was rich and famous , he could \u201c grab them \u201d by the genitals without recriminations .\nTrump dismissed the remarks as \u201c locker room talk \u201d and denied the subsequent accusations from more than 10 women who said he had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances .\nThroughout his campaign - and especially in his Republican convention speech in July - Trump described a dark America that had been knocked to its knees by China , Mexico , Russia and Islamic State . The American dream was dead , he said , smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians , and he said he alone could revive it .\nTrump said he would make America great again through the force of his personality , negotiating skill and business acumen . He offered vague plans to win economic concessions from China , to build a wall on the southern U.S. border to keep out undocumented immigrants and to make Mexico pay for it . He vowed to repeal Obamacare while being the \u201c greatest jobs president that God ever created \u201d and has proposed refusing entry to the United States of people from war-torn Middle Eastern nations , a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on Muslims .\nTrump promoted himself as the ultimate success story . He dated beautiful women , married three of them , had his own television reality show and erected skyscrapers that bore his name in big gold letters . Everything in his life was the greatest , the hugest , the classiest , the most successful , he said , even though critics assailed his experiences with bankruptcies , the failures of his Atlantic City , New Jersey , casinos and what they viewed as the misplaced pride he showed when presented with evidence he avoided paying taxes .\nTrump had flirted with presidential runs in the past and some initially saw his campaign as a vanity project meant to indulge his ego and burnish his brand . It was expected to be short-lived but as the election season progressed , he became the front-runner , winning state nominating contests despite an unconventional campaign that relied on large-scale rallies and mostly ignored grass-roots work .\nHis hired advisers came to realize there was only so much they could do to rein him in . His inner circle was dominated by his three oldest children - Donald Jr. , Eric and Ivanka , along with Ivanka \u2019 s husband , Jared Kushner .\nThe rise of Trump , once a registered Democrat , threatened to blow up the Republican Party . Its establishment challenged his commitment to their tenets and organized against him . Prominent Republicans - including former presidents George H.W . Bush and George W. Bush and congressional leaders - shunned him or offered lukewarm support .\nTrump used Twitter as a weapon , firing off insults and mockery at those who offended him , including \u201c Crooked Hillary \u201d and Republican rivals \u201c Little Marco \u201d Rubio , Jeb \u201c Low Energy \u201d Bush and \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d Cruz .\nAnother target was the family of a Muslim U.S. Army captain who died fighting in Iraq after the soldier \u2019 s father had spoken against Trump at the Democratic National Convention . Trump sniped back for days despite advice to move on .\nAs of late October , the New York Times had counted 282 people and things he had insulted on Twitter since declaring his candidacy .\nThe Trump candidacy was brimming with contradictions . The candidate who vowed to bring back jobs to the United States had his clothing line and campaign hats manufactured in foreign countries . The man who decried the corrupting power of money in politics boasted of having bought influence himself .\nUndocumented workers had been used on his building projects but as a candidate Trump vowed to ship illegal immigrants out of the country . He said no one respected women more than he did but even before the groping accusations emerged , he was branded a misogynist for making fun of the appearance of rival candidate Carly Fiorina and an apparent reference to the menstrual cycle of Fox News \u2019 Megyn Kelly .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign trail demeanor seemed to draw from his experiences as host of \u201c The Apprentice , \u201d a reality TV show where he barked a crowd-pleasing \u201c You \u2019 re fired ! \u201d at contestants who fell short in competitions .\nHis speeches were often unscripted and featured boasts on everything from his money to his IQ . He peppered them with dubiously sourced declarations , misperceptions and false statements .\nHe suggested that gun rights activists could act to stop Clinton from nominating liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices , a remark the Clinton campaign called dangerous .\nTrump boasted of a fortune he put at $ 10 billion , although in September Forbes magazine estimated it at $ 3.7 billion , making him the 156th richest American .\nTrump regularly made comments that would have doomed a more conventional candidate , such as when he said his supporters were so loyal that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York and not lose a single vote .\nIn May he would draw accusations of racism for questioning the impartiality of a judge - born in the United States to Mexican immigrants - who was hearing a lawsuit against him .\nNo other candidate referred to the size of his genitals during a debate .
