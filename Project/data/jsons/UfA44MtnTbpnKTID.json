Trump didn \u2019 t play along . \u201c I don \u2019 t kid , \u201d he said Tuesday when asked about the remark .\nThen he reversed himself , telling Fox News on Thursday \u201c Sometimes I jokingly say , or sarcastically say , if we didn \u2019 t do tests we would look great. \u201d But holding back on testing is \u201c not the right thing to do . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 broader point \u2014 \u201c If you don \u2019 t test , you don \u2019 t have any cases , \u201d he also said \u2014 flips science on its head . No one disputes the fact that testing for the virus is key to controlling it . Testing is only one measure of the pandemic . It is also measured by hospitalization and death , which continue even if authorities were to close their eyes to spreading sickness .\nCOVID-19 has killed about 125,000 people in the U.S . Infections are far higher than are known because many who get the disease and pass it on are not tested .\nTRUMP : \u201c There is tremendous evidence of fraud whenever you have mail-in ballots. \u201d \u2014 remarks Tuesday at Phoenix rally .\nVoting fraud actually is rare and Trump \u2019 s attempts to show otherwise have fallen flat .

A half-dozen senior advisers to the president have also voted by mail , according to election records obtained by The Associated Press .\nTRUMP : \u201c I \u2019 ve also made clear that any rioters damaging federal property and defacing our monuments will face severe and lengthy criminal penalties . Ten years. \u201d \u2014 remarks Tuesday in Phoenix .\nTHE FACTS : He has no such authority .

This action is taken effective immediately , but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused .
