    "content": "Today , the Senate makes a critical test vote on the Obama Administration \u2019 s trade agenda , kicking off a process that the White House hopes to end with the signing of an agreement between 12 nations called the Trans-Pacific Partnership . In preparation for this vote , President Obama has been deliberately antagonizing his critics , mostly liberal Democrats . Senator Elizabeth Warren is \u201c a politician , like everybody else , \u201d Obama said Friday to Yahoo News , who has `` got a voice that she wants to get out there , \u201d framing her concerns as insincere self-aggrandizement . Those concerns , Obama added , are \u201c absolutely wrong . ''\nThis is not the first time that Obama and his aides have depicted opposition on trade as deliberate misinformation designed to stir up a left-leaning political base , or generate campaign contributions ; my favorite is the claim that Warren is merely trying to energize a non-existent Presidential campaign .\nIt \u2019 s beneath the dignity of the Presidency to so aggressively paint opponents as not just wrong on the facts , but hiding the truth on purpose . Warren has responded without using the same indecorous tactics . Unfortunately , I don \u2019 t have the same self-control . So by way of response , here are ten moments where the President or his subordinates have lied \u2013 call it `` misled '' or `` offered half-truths '' or whatever ; but I \u2019 m in an ornery mood so let \u2019 s just say lied \u2013 about his trade agenda :\n1 . 40 PERCENT : The President and his team have repeatedly described TPP as a deal involving nearly 40 percent of global GDP . This tells only part of the story . First of all , the U.S. by itself represents 22 percent of global GDP ; a bill naming a post office would involve that much . Second , we already have free trade agreements with six TPP partners \u2013 Canada , Mexico , Australia , Singapore , Chile and Peru \u2013 and between them and us , that \u2019 s 80 percent of the total GDP in this deal . The vast majority of the rest is represented by Japan , where the average applied tariff is a skinny 1.2 percent , per the World Bank .\nYou can see this paragraph in graphic form here . The point is that saying TPP is about \u201c 40 percent of GDP \u201d intimates that it would massively change the ability to export without tariffs . In reality it would have virtually no significance in opening new markets . To the extent that there \u2019 s a barrier in global trade today , it comes from currency manipulation by countries wanting to keep their exports cheap . The TPP has no currency provisions .\n2 . JOB CREATION : Saying , as the White House has , that the deal would support \u201c an additional 650,000 jobs \u201d is not true . This figure came from a hypothetical calculation of a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics , which the Institute itself said was an incorrect way to use their data . \u201c We don \u2019 t believe that trade agreements change the labor force in the long run , \u201d said Peter Petri , author of the report , in a fact check of the claim .\nThe deal is actually more about building up barriers than taking them down . Much of TPP is devoted to increasing copyright and patent protections for prescription drugs and Hollywood media content . As economist Dean Baker notes , this is protectionist , and will raise prices for drugs , movies and music here and abroad .\n3 . EXPORTS ONLY : The Administration constantly discusses trade as solely a question of U.S. exports . A recent Council of Economic Advisors report touts : Exporters pay higher wages , and export industry growth translates into higher average earnings . But the Economic Policy Institute points out that this ignores imports , and therefore the ballooning trade deficit , which weighs down economic growth and wages . Talking about trade without discussing both imports and exports is like relaying the score of a ballgame by saying \u201c Dodgers 4. \u201d It is literally a half-truth . Recent trade deals have in fact increased the trade deficit , such as the agreement with South Korea . Senator Sherrod Brown notes that the deal has only increased exports by $ 1 billion since 2011 , while increasing imports by $ 12 billion , costing America 75,000 jobs .\n4 . MOST PROGRESSIVE : Obama has called TPP \u201c the most progressive trade deal in history. \u201d First of all , so did Bill Clinton and Al Gore , when talking about NAFTA in 1993 . Second , there \u2019 s reason to believe TPP doesn \u2019 t even clear a low bar for progressive trade deals . The Sierra Club , based on a leaked TPP environmental chapter , said that the deal is weaker than the landmark \u201c May 10 agreement \u201d for deals with Peru , Panama and Colombia , struck in 2007 . Key Democrats who devised labor and environmental standards for those agreements , like Rep. Sander Levin , believe that TPP falls short . Even if the chapters were up to par , consistent lack of enforcement of the rules makes them ineffective . The U.S. Trade Representative has actually claimed the Colombia free trade agreement is positive because only one trade unionist in the country is being murdered every other week . Labor groups can only ask the White House to enforce labor rights violations , and for the past several years , the Administration simply hasn \u2019 t . So when Obama says violators of TPP will face \u201c meaningful consequences , \u201d based on the Administration \u2019 s prior enforcement , he \u2019 s lying .\n5 . CHANGING LAWS : On the controversial topic of Investor-State Dispute Settlement ( ISDS ) , where corporations can sue sovereign governments for monetary damages for violating trade agreements that hurt the company \u2019 s \u201c expected future profits , \u201d the White House has engaged in a shell game . They say , \u201c No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws. \u201d But the point of a corporation suing the United States or any trade partner is to put enough financial pressure on a government to force them to alter the law themselves . So ISDS doesn \u2019 t \u201c cause \u201d a change in law only in the narrowest sense . Even third-party countries have curtailed regulations in reaction to ISDS rulings , as New Zealand did with their cigarette packaging law , awaiting the outcome of a dispute between the tobacco industry and Australia ( a suit that continues despite an initial victory for Australia ) .\n6 . NEVER LOST : The White House assumes that the only thing America cares about with ISDS is the upsetting of our own laws . So they \u2019 ve stressed that the U.S. has never lost an ISDS case . This is irrelevant . What ISDS does is offer bailout insurance policy to multinational corporations . If they run into discrimination or regulatory squeezing by a foreign government , they can use an extra-judicial process to recoup their investment . Workers screwed over by trade agreements have no ability to sue governments ; only corporations get this privilege .\nThe United States attracts businesses through our relative rule of law . When that insurance is granted to countries like Vietnam and Malaysia , it weakens our competitive advantage , and makes it simple for countries to outsource their operations . Their investment is protected , as is their ability to exploit cheap labor . This makes it impossible for America to compete .\n7 . WEAKENING DODD-FRANK : Obama reacted strongly to Senator Warren \u2019 s charge that a future President could overturn financial regulations or other rules through trade deals . \u201c I \u2019 d have to be pretty stupid , \u201d Obama told Yahoo News , to \u201c sign a provision that would unravel \u201d signature achievements like Dodd-Frank . I suppose he is , then , because modern trade agreements often seek to \u201c harmonize \u201d regulations , effectively setting a regulatory ceiling . This harmonization could , as Warren says , \u201c punch holes in Dodd-Frank without directly repealing it , \u201d by forcing regulators to roll back capital or leverage requirements .\nEuropean negotiators want a trade agreement with the U.S. called the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) to include a chapter \u201c harmonizing \u201d financial regulations . So far the Obama Administration has rejected this , while admitting the potential for regulatory harm . Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Congress in December 2013 , \u201c Normally in a trade agreement , the pressure is to lower standards \u201d on regulations , \u201c and that \u2019 s something that we just think is not acceptable. \u201d A future President might find it acceptable , and today \u2019 s vote on \u201c fast-track \u201d authority would give trade deals an expedited process , with no amendments or filibusters by Congress , for six years , outlasting the current Administration . Scott Walker or Jeb Bush may decide it \u2019 s perfectly appropriate to undermine regulations in trade deals .\n8 . STOPPING CHINA : President Obama frequently casts TPP as a way to \u201c contain \u201d China . \u201c If we don \u2019 t write the rules for trade around the world , guess what , China will , \u201d he said on Friday . This is so facile as to be totally meaningless . China is a major Pacific Rim economy , and will have a presence regardless of our actions . As former Clinton Defense Department official Chas Freeman writes , \u201c China has been and will remain an inseparable part of China \u2019 s success story. \u201d Plus , as I \u2019 ve written in \u2588\u2588\u2588 , weak \u201c rule of origin \u201d guidelines could allow China to import goods into TPP member countries without any tariffs , while freed from following any TPP regulations .\n9 . SECRET DEAL : Obama has angrily dismissed the notion that TPP is a \u201c secret \u201d deal , saying that everyone will have public access to the TPP text for at least 60 days before a final vote . This is not the point opponents are making . The vote on fast track would severely limit Congressional input into the deal . And right now , members of Congress can only see the text in a secure room , without being able to bring staffers or take notes , or even talk about specifics in public . That makes the deal effectively secret during the fast track vote . \u201c The president has only committed to letting the public see this deal after Congress votes to authorize fast track , \u201d Warren told Greg Sargent . The President wants to filibuster-proof the bill in secret , then employ pretend transparency on TPP after that .\n10 . JUST A POLITICIAN : This idea from Obama that everybody opposing fast-track is acting like a mere \u201c politician , \u201d aside from demonizing the concept of representing constituents , neglects the fact that he \u2019 s a politician too . His interest in building a legacy , when practically nothing else has the potential to pass Congress the next two years , is a political interest . His possible interest in rewarding campaign contributors who would benefit from TPP is also political , or his desire to earn the respect of the Very Serious People who always support trade deals . Since Obama has a large platform and will not publicly debate any opponent on trade , he can float above it all , acting like a principled soul only wanting to better the country rather than a transactional ward heeler . This may be the biggest lie , that Obama \u2019 s somehow superior to everyone else in this debate .",
