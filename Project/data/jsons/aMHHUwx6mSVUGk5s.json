    "content": "In his fifth State of the Union address , President Obama declared that 2014 would be a \u201c year of action \u201d and that if Congress wasn \u2019 t willing to work with him , he was prepared to act on his own .\nPartisans immediately took to their corners , with Republicans crying \u201c imperial president \u201d and Democrats applauding his \u201c leadership . \u201d\nSince becoming president , Mr. Obama has already amply demonstrated his willingness to go around Congress and use executive power to advance his agenda \u2013 on gay rights , in protecting young illegal immigrants from deportation , in curbing greenhouse gases .\nAnd on Tuesday , Obama took more unilateral steps , mostly aimed at helping working Americans become more upwardly mobile . He announced a new type of government savings bond , called the MyRA , to help Americans save for retirement . He asked Vice President Joe Biden to lead a reform of training programs to help workers gain skills . He promised to \u201c cut red tape \u201d to spur construction of factories that use natural gas . Earlier in the day , the White House announced the president would sign an executive order raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 for low-wage workers on new federal contracts .\nBut these were all relatively small-bore initiatives , reminiscent of the last Democratic president , Bill Clinton , who retreated to midnight basketball and school uniforms when faced with a balky Congress .\nThe test of Obama \u2019 s intentions lies ahead . And in delivering a speech that was largely devoid of red-meat rhetoric , the president left open the possibility of working with Republicans in Congress on major initiatives , such as immigration and tax reform .\n\u201c As president , I \u2019 m committed to making Washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here , \u201d he said . \u201c I believe most of you are , too . \u201d\nIn fact , his call to make 2014 a \u201c year of action \u201d was framed not as a year of go-it-alone executive action , but as a year of collaboration with Congress .\n\u201c In the coming months , let 's see where else we can make progress together , \u201d Obama said . \u201c Let 's make this a year of action . That 's what most Americans want \u2013 for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations . \u201d\nHe offered what he called practical proposals to speed economic growth , strengthen the middle class , and build \u201c ladders of opportunity \u201d into the middle class . And only then , after extending an olive branch , did he come forward with the \u201c or else . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m eager to work with all of you \u201d to accomplish those goals , he said . \u201c But America does not stand still \u2013 and neither will I . So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families , that 's what I 'm going to do . \u201d\nThe reality of executive authority is that there are limits , and Obama knows that . Last November , when confronted by a heckler who demanded that he halt all deportations , the president \u2019 s off-the-cuff response sounded definitive .\n`` We 've got this Constitution , we 've got this whole thing about separation of powers , '' Obama said . `` So there is no shortcut to politics , and there 's no shortcut to democracy . ''\nThe question , still , is where Obama sees the line between what he can do on his own and where he needs Congress . He will not raise the federal minimum wage on his own , he has made clear . His decision to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers \u2013 an action that ultimately will affect a few hundred thousand workers \u2013 was aimed at spurring Congress to act on behalf of workers across the board , administration officials say .\nStill , to critics , even that limited move was beyond the pale . In an interview with CNN , conservative Rep. Steve King ( R ) of Iowa called Obama \u2019 s executive order on the minimum wage for contractors a \u201c constitutional violation . \u201d\nSen.
