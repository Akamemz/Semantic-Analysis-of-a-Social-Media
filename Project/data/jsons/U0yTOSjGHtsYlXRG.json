She added : \u201c Mrs Trump \u2026 hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform . \u201d\nFormer first lady Laura Bush has made a similar plea , writing in the Washington Post that a zero-tolerance policy was \u201c cruel \u201d and \u201c immoral \u201d . But unlike Melania Trump , Bush placed responsibility firmly on the Trump administration \u2019 s policy , not \u201c both sides \u201d .\n\u201c The reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for their parents , who are accused of illegally crossing our borders , \u201d she wrote .\nPlay Video 1:38 US immigration protests as hundreds of children held in Texas facility \u2013 video\nMelania Trump \u2019 s intervention came as reports emerged of children being held in cages at a warehouse in Texas after being separated from their parents .

Show Hide Why are children being separated from their families ? In April 2018 , the US attorney general , Jeff Sessions , announced a \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department . This includes some , but not all , asylum seekers . Because children can \u2019 t be held in adult detention facilities , they are being separated from their parents . Immigrant advocacy groups , however , say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017 . More than 200 child welfare groups , including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations , said they opposed the practice . What happens to the children ? They are supposed to enter the system for processing \u201c unaccompanied alien children \u201d , which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own . Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents . They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents , relatives or family friends to place them with in the US . This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children . Can these children be reunited with their parents ? Immigration advocacy groups and attorneys have warned that there is not a clear system in place to reunite families . In one case , attorneys in Texas said they had been given a phone number to help parents locate their children , but it ended up being the number for an immigration enforcement tip line . Advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents , who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country . And if , for instance , a parent is deported , there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them . What happened to families before ? When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014 , Barack Obama \u2019 s administration detained families . This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation . Instead , they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court .
