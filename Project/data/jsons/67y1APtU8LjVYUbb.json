There 's racist and anti-racist , '' Kendi said . `` Racist ideas suggest that there 's something wrong or right , superior or inferior about a particular group . It suggests there 's something inherently normal about white Americans , that Americans are white and whites are Americans . And his idea suggests that somehow people of color are not American , and that 's deeply racist .

There was no racial language in them . You do n't have to have racial language in an idea or even in a policy for it to be racist .
