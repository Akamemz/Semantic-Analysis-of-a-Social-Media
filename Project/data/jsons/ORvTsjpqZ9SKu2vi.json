    "content": "On June 25 , the Pew Research Center published a startling poll . The difference between Democratic and Republican attitudes on Covid-19 was growing . Thirty-seven percent of Democrats , but 72 percent of Republicans , said they \u2019 d feel comfortable getting a haircut . Twenty-eight percent of Democrats , but 65 percent of Republicans , were willing to eat in a restaurant . Eight percent of Democrats , but 31 percent of Republicans , would attend a crowded party . All in all , the Pew poll found that partisanship was the single biggest driver of attitudes toward the coronavirus \u2014 dwarfing the effects of geography , age , gender , or race .\nNow America \u2019 s coronavirus rate is on the rise , racing into uncharted territory even as Europe , Canada , and Japan hold new case rates to about 100 per million residents , or under . This chart is a stark reminder that the outbreak we \u2019 re experiencing isn \u2019 t an inevitability of the disease , but a staggering failure of policy and public health compliance :\nBehind those lines lie the obvious mistakes and elite signals : States are reopening despite meeting few of the guidelines to end lockdowns . The president is holding indoor rallies , his campaign aides removing stickers encouraging social distancing at the venue . Masks have become part of America \u2019 s culture war . America is headed for a disaster driven not so much by the disease as by the politics that surround it .\n\u201c America is the global exception right now , \u201d says Gregorio Millett , director of public policy at amFAR . \u201c Just look at the EU or New Zealand or countries across Asia . These places have vastly different cultures , different geographies , different institutions , different everything \u2014 but the one thing they have in common is that everyone is following public health measures . And they \u2019 ve all kept this virus at bay . Our leaders decided to politicize a scientific issue and as a result , our curve looks different than the rest of the world \u2019 s . \u201d\nWhich raises the question : Is political polarization literally killing us ?\nThere are two types of polarization worth separating out here : I \u2019 ll call them structural polarization and discretionary polarization .\nStructural polarization stems from the core incentives of American politics . Elections are zero-sum affairs , and voters reward the majority party for successful , popular governance . The minority party \u2019 s default tendency to oppose the majority party \u2019 s signature initiatives is an example of structural polarization . It can be resisted or overcome , but it flows from the basic structure of our political system .\nDiscretionary polarization reflects the idiosyncratic decisions leaders make . Take face masks , for example . In an alternative universe , where President Mitt Romney is in the final year of his second term , would there be a politicized culture war over face masks ? I doubt it . President Romney would be wearing a mask and urging others to do the same , just as Sen. Romney , and many of his colleagues , are doing now .\n\u201c We must have no stigma , none , about wearing masks when we leave our homes and come near other people , \u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor . \u201c Wearing simple face coverings is not about protecting ourselves , it is about protecting everyone we encounter . There is nothing cowardly about common courtesy . \u201d\nThere is nothing intrinsic to the structure of American politics , or the composition of the Republican Party , that made Trump turn against masks .
