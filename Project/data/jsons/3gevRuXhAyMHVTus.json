With each passing day , aides said , Mr. Obama has taken note every time he passes a milestone .\n\u201c This is my last debate prep practice , \u201d he said at Camp David .\n\u201c This is my last walk-through , \u201d he said , touring a debate stage .\n\u201c This is my last debate , \u201d he said after squaring off a third time with Mitt Romney .\nThe \u201c lasts \u201d piled up on a bone-weary final weekend as he raced from Ohio to Wisconsin , Iowa to Virginia , New Hampshire to Florida and back to Ohio , then Colorado and Wisconsin again . What he hopes most is that these are not the last days of his presidency .\n\u201c You can see the nostalgia , the wistfulness , setting in , \u201d observed Dan Pfeiffer , one of his longest-serving advisers and now the White House communications director . \u201c The focus here is winning and making the case , but the last campaign of a man \u2019 s life \u2014 you every once in a while pause and think about that . \u201d\nOther than a brief interlude for Hurricane Sandy , the White House has been relocated to Air Force One for months . Mr. Obama half-jogs off the plane and half-jogs onto the stage , his coat off , his sleeves rolled up , his tie usually gone . He has grown hoarse arguing his case . Between stops , he huddles in the plane \u2019 s conference room , nursing his throat with tea and scratching out his speech in longhand .\nHis daily routine has been upended , but he tries to keep up his workout regimen in hotel fitness centers . He eats whenever he can , usually whatever the Air Force stewards are serving aboard the plane or something brought in before a speech . Occasionally , when he stops to glad-hand at a pizza place or a doughnut shop , he may snack in the motorcade to the next campaign rally ; at a Cleveland meat shop , he bought barbecue jerky .\nHe is happier whenever he gets time with Michelle Obama , but she has largely kept a separate schedule . Like any father on the road , he makes sure to call his wife and children every evening . To keep him company in recent weeks , friends like Marty Nesbitt and Mike Ramos have accompanied him aboard Air Force One . Between conference calls on storm recovery on Sunday , he checked out the Chicago Bears football game on the Air Force One television .\nThe other day , Mr. Obama landed in Chicago to vote and spotted his former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , now the city \u2019 s mayor , waiting on the tarmac . A huge grin appeared on the president \u2019 s face , and he pointed at Mr. Emanuel . The mayor grinned and pointed back . The two embraced like long-lost brothers and chatted happily before walking , arm in arm , to shake hands with bystanders .\n\u201c He \u2019 s got his goal in eyesight , and he \u2019 s driving to the basket , \u201d Mr. Emanuel said later . \u201c He \u2019 s a happy warrior , I \u2019 d say . \u201d\nHappier with the debates over . He considered preparations for the first one \u201c a drag , \u201d as he put it , and got walloped . It was an eye-opener for a president who has never lacked confidence , a moment when he \u201c faced his own political mortality , \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said . \u201c The first debate turned a switch for him . He came out of that very focused on ensuring that would never happen again. \u201d By his own reckoning , Mr. Obama had failed to \u201c communicate why he wants a second term , \u201d said another adviser .\nSenator John Kerry of Massachusetts , who played Mr. Romney during debate rehearsals , said Mr. Obama recognized the peril . \u201c He just decided in his mind that he needed to bear down and win , period , \u201d Mr. Kerry said in an interview . \u201c He \u2019 s a competitive guy . He \u2019 s very analytical . He knows exactly what he had not done and exactly what he wanted to do . \u201d\nAfter coming out stronger in the later debates , Mr. Obama could finally return to the trail , where the affirmation of the crowd beats the pounding of the pundits . The crowds are smaller \u2014 he drew 24,000 here in Bristow , compared with 60,000 and 80,000 in his final days in 2008 \u2014 but they are enthusiastic , and he draws energy from them .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .
