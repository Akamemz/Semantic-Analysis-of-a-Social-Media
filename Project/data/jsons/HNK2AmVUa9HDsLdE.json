But if you dig a little deeper you 'll find a clear dividing line , and it boils down to one word : money .\nPeople whose household income is more than $ 75,000 a year have very different perceptions of what affects health than those whose household income is less than $ 25,000 . This is one key finding in a poll conducted by NPR , the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health . One third of respondents who are low income say lack of money has a harmful effect on health .\nThis is the case for 29-year-old Anna Beer of Spokane , Wash. She lives with her husband in the basement of her father 's house . Beer got laid off from her job as a nanny last summer . Now she is attending college in the hope that she will get a better than minimum-wage job when she graduates . Beer 's husband earns $ 10 an hour working at a retail store . `` This is probably the most poor we 've been , '' Beer says .\nMy health is deteriorating and I know what the cause of it is , but I ca n't fix it .\nWhen she was working , Beer could afford to buy fresh fruits and vegetables and chicken from the local farmer 's markets . Now she buys canned and frozen vegetables , which are cheaper but not as healthy .\n`` They 've had preservatives added to them , a lot of times salt that 's just not good for you , '' she says . Poor diet and financial stress have had a huge impact on her health , Beer says . Her migraines are worse and her health has deteriorated . It 's frustrating , she says . `` I know what the cause of it is , but I ca n't fix it . It 's hard . ''\nLosing a job increased the odds of developing stress related health conditions by 83 percent .\nOne in 5 people in our poll say they are in a similar position \u2014 low paying jobs or unemployment harms their health . And there 's research to back this up . Kate Strully , a sociologist at the University at Albany , State University of New York , studied what happened when healthy people were laid off following a plant closing . She found that losing a job increased the odds of developing stress-related health conditions by 83 percent \u2014 conditions like stroke , heart disease , diabetes and emotional or psychiatric conditions .\nAnother social fact that affects health is housing . Forty percent of the low-income people in our poll say bad housing causes bad health . Uzuri Pease-Greene says this is true for her family . She rents a small two-bedroom apartment with her husband , two daughters and a grandchild in a public housing complex in San Francisco . When something breaks , she says it takes years to get it fixed . Ovens do n't work , there are holes in the walls , the water does n't work or there 's a sewage backup .\nThen there is the constant stress of the neighborhood . `` You have shootings , stabbings and break-ins , '' Pease-Greene , 49 , says . `` People with their music up at all times of the night , people arguing , fighting , fussing , people using dope , being drunk . '' She worries about her 4-year-old granddaughter growing up in this environment .\nThe impact of childhood experiences on adult health is another surprising finding in our poll . More than any other factor in childhood , people say abuse and neglect contribute to poor health in adults . This is what happened to Daniel , who is 65 years old and lives in San Diego . We agreed not to use his full name because he worries about losing his job .\nWhen he was about 8 years old and his sister was 4 , `` I walked in to the dining room and my mother was beating my sister with a big old wooden spoon , '' he says . `` My mother 's just wailing on her , telling her she 's a dirty little girl and a pig . ''\nIt turned out Daniel 's sister had gone across the street to the grocery store . A man touched her inappropriately and she told her mother . When he saw his sister being beaten , Daniel started crying . His stepfather said , `` I 'll give you something to cry about . '' And he started `` beating the hell out of me too , so there we were \u2014 that 's our Sunday \u2014 not untypical at all . ''\nBy the time he was 12 years old , Daniel says , he was smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol . He started doing drugs after getting out of the military , all to nearly unbelievable extremes . On any given day , seven days a week , Daniel says he drank 12 to 18 beers , a half bottle of whiskey and smoked two to four packs of cigarettes a day .\nDaniel traces his addictions to the abuse he suffered as a child . And by the time he reached his 50s , Daniel 's health problems were severe . He was 60 pounds overweight ; he had high blood pressure , high cholesterol , liver damage , lung damage and diabetes . But nothing was as overwhelming as the emotional burden . `` Have you ever seen a dog that 's been beaten and abused ? '' he says . `` You raise your hand and the dog will cower . ''\nDaniel was finally diagnosed with PTSD when he was in his mid-50s . It was a relief , he says . With the help of talk therapy he learned to manage his symptoms . He quit smoking , rarely drinks and has lost weight , exercising four times a week . And life is finally tolerable .",
