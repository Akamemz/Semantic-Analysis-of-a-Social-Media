    "content": "Almost immediately after former Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick entered the presidential race last week , he started facing questions about his 2014 decision to push out two officials who had tried to put his brother-in-law on the state \u2019 s sex offender registry .\nThe backstory : According to a complaint filed by one of the officials , in 1993 , Bernard Sigh pleaded guilty under California \u2019 s spousal rape law to using force to rape his then-wife , Patrick \u2019 s sister . He served four months in prison , reconciled with his wife , and moved with her to Massachusetts in 1995 . The following year , the state enacted a law requiring anyone convicted of a sex offense in Massachusetts or \u201c like \u201d offenses in other states to register . Sigh didn \u2019 t submit his name to the registry . His conviction remained largely unknown until Patrick ran for governor in 2006 , when it was unearthed in what was widely viewed as an attempt at campaign mudslinging .\nPatrick won anyway , and in the following months the Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Board examined whether Sigh should have been on the list . Sigh argued that he shouldn \u2019 t be required to register because California \u2019 s spousal rape law was not similar enough to Massachusetts \u2019 rape law , which did not distinguish between offenses that occur in and outside of marriage . A registry officer agreed , but the chair and the executive director of the board unsuccessfully tried to overturn the ruling . Seven years later , shortly before he left office , Patrick ousted the two women from their positions . He explained in a press conference that his decision traced back to them \u201c inappropriately interfering \u201d with Sigh \u2019 s case years earlier .\nIn a recent statement to the Washington Post , Patrick defended his decision to push out the two officials as an attempt to hold them accountable , and he characterized the episode as a painful personal matter best \u201c left out of the public eye. \u201d But the controversy over his actions has glossed over the ruling at the heart of the matter\u2014and the idea that spousal rape is legally different than other kinds of rape .\nThat distinction is an old one . For most of American history , rape within marriage wasn \u2019 t considered rape . The idea traces back to the writings of Sir Matthew Hale , an 17th-century English jurist who theorized that wives give \u201c irrevocable consent \u201d to their husbands . \u201c By their mutual matrimonial consent and contract , the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband which she can not retract , \u201d Hale wrote . For centuries , the American legal system nodded along with this notion . And the logic behind it persists : In 2015 , Donald Trump \u2019 s then-fixer Michael Cohen told reporters , \u201c By the very definition , you can \u2019 t rape your spouse . \u201d\nYet in the 1970s and 1980s , women \u2019 s rights activism , court rulings , and a growing body of research into the prevalence of marital rape led state legislatures to expand their definitions of sexual assault to include incidents between spouses . By 1993 , when Sigh was convicted , every state had laws classifying spousal rape as a crime in some form .\nBut many states still treat spousal rape as different from other rapes , providing exemptions for spouses depending on the facts of the case and the severity of the charge , says Patti Powers , a former Washington sex crimes prosecutor and attorney advisor at AEquitas , a nonprofit that educates prosecutors about gender-based violence .
