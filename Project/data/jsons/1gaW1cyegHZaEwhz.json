Yet sadly , there 's more .\nThis hollowing out \u2014 of all of the most critical infrastructure upon which our day to day life rests\u2014 was done as we squandered trillions on a further notice global war on terror that only proliferated terror and set off the worst global refugee crisis since World War II .\nThis would not be histrionics , because right now we are spending several hundred billion dollars a year just to service the debt we racked up subsidizing multinational defense contractors who show their gratitude with tax avoidance .\nAnd while our decades of disinvestment in public health has us now scrambling to improvise an effective coronavirus response , the Trump and the GOP tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans accelerated wealth concentration and sunk the government deeper into debt .\nMeanwhile , America 's rural and urban hospitals were being decimated , thanks to the predations of a profit driven health care system and the refusal of Republican governors to act on the 2014 opportunity under the Affordable Health Care Act to expand Medicaid for millions of low-income households .\nAs Oliver Millman recently reported in the Guardian , `` hospital closures in rural areas of the US hit their highest point in the past decade last year , with 19 rural hospitals shutting down '' with `` 34 facilities shuttering in the past 24 months . ''\nSince 2010 , 120 hospitals in rural states like Texas ( 20 ) , Tennessee ( 17 ) , Oklahoma ( 7 ) , and Georgia ( 7 ) have fared the worst .\nWhat Millman 's analysis found was that hospitals were much more likely to face closure in states with spiteful GOP governors , driven by Tea Party ideology , who refused to expand Medicaid the hospitals .\n`` Using a model that shows risk factors for hospitals , the report found that 453 rural hospitals across the US are vulnerable to closure , '' the Guardian reported . `` Being in a state that has accepted expanded Medicaid help decreases the likelihood of closure by 62 percent on average , according to the analysis . ''\nBut rural America is not the only place where the backlash against Obamacare and Wall Street driven predators are closing hospitals and leaving poorer communities vulnerable to something like the novel coronavirus .\nAccording to the Health Care Financial Management Association , in 2017 , the first year of Trump 's presidency , 16 hospitals closed .

''\nHe continued : `` That egalitarian mission led to some 150 patients treated in its emergency room per day \u2013 including many who do n't have a medical emergency , but lack insurance and ca n't afford a primary care doctor . It also led to a financial balance sheet featuring $ 3 million a month in losses \u2013 brutal numbers that would make any executive reach for the antacids . ''\nThe Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals , along with community advocates and Sen.
