    "content": "Congress Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling A group of former House Democratic staffers wanted to channel their post-election grief . They never imagined what would happen next .\nGRAND RAPIDS , Mich \u2014 Hill Republicans are openly accusing liberal mega-donors of bankrolling the tide of local protesters storming their offices . They \u2019 re beefing up their physical protection from demonstrators . And they \u2019 re imploring out-of-state critics to stop clogging their phone lines .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just yelling and criticizing . There is no substance , \u201d said Rep. Dave Brat ( R-Va. ) . \u201c It \u2019 s a protest against the election . \u201d\nTo which Angel Padilla , a co-founder of the group organizing the demonstrations that have spread across the country in a matter of weeks , had this to say : You 'd better get used to it .\n`` We want to pressure these members of Congress for as long as we have this president , \u201d Padilla said .\nDubbed \u201c Indivisible , \u201d the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow ex-Democratic aides to channel their post-election heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trump \u2019 s agenda . They drafted a 26-page protest guide for activists , full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders .\nThe booklet concludes with a stirring promise to fellow Trump enemies : \u201c Good luck \u2014 we will win . \u201d\nThe group isn \u2019 t planning to limit itself to the town-hall resistance to repealing Obamacare that it \u2019 s becoming known for . Indivisible has marshaled demonstrations against Trump \u2019 s Cabinet nominees and his immigration order , and it \u2019 s partnering with the organizers of the Jan. 21 Women \u2019 s March for a new action next week .\nIts handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis . They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros , which they flatly deny .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter who we take money from \u2014 we \u2019 re always going to get blamed as a Soros group , even if we don \u2019 t take money from Soros , \u201d said Padilla , now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center . \u201c That \u2019 s one of the attacks and that \u2019 s fine . \u201d\nThe group began when Ezra Levin , a former aide to Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett , commiserated over the election in late November with his wife Leah Greenberg , a longtime aide to ex-Virginia Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello . The couple was \u201c going through the stages of grief , like a lot of progressives , \u201d Levin recalled in an interview , \u201c and wanted to do what we could to help . \u201d\nThey got to work on what became the `` Indivisible Guide , '' billed as a set of \u201c best practices for making Congress listen. \u201d The manual borrows openly from the early tactics of the Tea Party , which sprouted on the strength of local conservative resistance to former President Barack Obama \u2019 s hefty government stimulus bill and health care reform plan .\n\u201c Trump is not popular , \u201d the guide states . \u201c He does not have a mandate . He does not have large congressional majorities . If a small minority in the Tea Party could stop President Obama , then we the majority can stop a petty tyrant named Trump . \u201d\nThe Indivisible manual is often blunt about what it says members of Congress really tick \u2014 and how protesters might use it to their advantage . One chart compares what `` your MoC cares a lot about '' ( an example : `` an interest group 's endorsement '' ) vs. what a lawmaker `` does n't care much about '' ( for one , `` your thoughtful analysis of the proposed bill '' ) .\nLevin , Greenberg , Padilla , and another former Doggett aide , Jeremy Haile , continued tweaking the guide even as their burgeoning effort mushroomed a full-fledged movement . About two dozen veteran Hill staffers and activists contributed or edited the guide in some way since that November first draft , according to Levin .\nWhile the millions-strong turnout for anti-Trump Women \u2019 s Marches captured the nation last month , the Indivisible founders were conscious of the need for protest tactics that could truly force members of Congress to pay attention \u2014 or risk losing their seats .\n\u201c Marches are great to bring people together , but our experience as congressional staffers had taught us that energy needed to be channeled in a smart way to make a difference on Capitol Hill , \u201d Haile said .\nIndivisible 's founders never planned or expected the groundswell of interest that resulted from their guide , which prompted them to organize as a 501 ( c ) 4 group this month . `` The last thing the progressive ecosystem really needed was yet another nonprofit , '' Levin said .\nBut Indivisible 's guide has spread at the grassroots level at an unpredictable speed this year , with the help of other liberal groups amplifying its message . Less than two months after the group launched its website , 225,000 interested participants have registered to learn more , according to Levin .\nIt helped that Doggett was one of the first Democrats targeted by the tea party in the summer of 2009 . During one of his routine Saturday morning office hours that August , hundreds of local conservative activists showed up wearing Revolutionary War costumes , Haile recalled . They chanted and jeered while carrying tombstones and coffins , and the chaotic scene caught the attention of the national media . Doggett required an escort to leave his own event that day .\nFast forward to last weekend . Police escorted Rep. Tom McClintock ( R-Calif. ) out of his own town hall meeting after a local Indivisible chapter joined other progressive groups to protest it .\nWhen the tea party began rattling lawmakers with local disruptions , Haile explained , \u201c what mattered was this sense around the members that their constituents were unhappy . And what that is did is create discontent around Congress but also energized angry people who said , ' I \u2019 m angry ; we \u2019 re angry ; and if we join together we can make a difference and get members of Congress to change their positions . ' \u201d\nThat alignment of protesters galvanized by many different issues is a linchpin of Indivisible \u2019 s early success . The group doesn \u2019 t have a core policy mission : some chapters protest in defense of Obamacare ; others embrace criminal justice reform or rally against Trump \u2019 s controversial travel ban .\nChapters don \u2019 t even have to call themselves Indivisible . Levin estimated that no more than 40 percent of the 6,200 local affiliates registered on the group \u2019 s website use the name .\nThe organizers of Indivisible Grand Rapids , for example , hadn \u2019 t spoken to any original drafters in Washington before they helped marshal a crowd of several hundred to a Thursday night town hall meeting held by Rep. Justin Amash ( R-Mich. ) .
