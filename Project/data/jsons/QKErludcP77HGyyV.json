    "content": "The delegates at the Democratic convention conducted the ceremonial roll call vote after Mr. Clinton \u2019 s speech , with Ohio putting Mr. Obama over the top and formally elevating him as the party \u2019 s presidential nominee at 12:06 a.m .\nIn a convention hall still buzzing from Mr. Clinton \u2019 s speech well after it ended , delegates said they believed the former president had managed to give the defense of Mr. Obama they had been waiting for .\n\u201c Some people just have to have it spelled out for them , \u201d said Linda Brooks , 64 , of Hampton Roads , Va. \u201c He speaks in plain words people can understand . \u201d\nIn the 45-minute speech , Mr. Clinton paid tribute to a spirit of bipartisan political cooperation that he lamented was now missing . He characterized Mr. Obama as a president who wanted to bring that spirit back , noting that the president appointed Republican cabinet secretaries and former political rivals like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Clinton \u2019 s wife , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton . The relationship they built , he said , sent a signal abroad .\n\u201c Democracy does not have to be a blood sport , \u201d Mr. Clinton said . \u201c It can be an honorable enterprise . \u201d\nThe arrival here by Mr. Clinton had the feel of a valedictory , particularly as Mr. Obama arrived on stage at the end of the speech , while thousands of Democrats here thundered their approval . It was , perhaps , a capstone in the political career of Mr. Clinton , who was delivering his eighth speech to a Democratic National Convention .\nMr. Clinton offered a comprehensive , even exhaustive , assessment of Mr. Obama \u2019 s first-term priorities , from the auto bailout to the health care law . Brandishing statistics with a familiar vigor , he laid out a case that each of Mr. Obama \u2019 s initiatives had met the Republican litmus test : leaving Americans better than four years ago .\n\u201c Is the president satisfied ? Of course not , but are we better off than we were when he took office ? \u201d Mr. Clinton said , pausing as the crowd roared in approval . He added , \u201c The answer is yes . \u201d\nMr. Clinton used the successful economic record of his presidency to offer an illustration of the magnitude of the problems Mr. Obama inherited when he took office in 2009 .\n\u201c President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did , \u201d Mr. Clinton said . \u201c No president , not me , not any of my predecessors , could have repaired all of the damage he found in just four years . \u201d\nFollowing the speech by Michelle Obama on Tuesday night , the appearance of Mr. Clinton was the highlight of the convention \u2019 s second night and underscored the tight nature of the presidential race . He was invited by Mr. Obama himself , who asked him earlier this summer to become more involved in his re-election campaign .\nIt was in many ways a poignant evening , in part because it marked the full reconciliation of the two most popular Democrats of the past 30 years , but also because Mr. Clinton has been increasingly talking about his own mortality .\nMr. Clinton \u2019 s voice was hoarse , as it has often been through his career , but that seemed to do little though to tamp down his energy , enthusiasm or appeal to the crowd .\nMr. Clinton \u2019 s presence here inspired gratitude among Mr. Obama \u2019 s aides and followers , particularly given the close nature of the presidential race , but it also stirred at least a degree of speculation about the future of one of America \u2019 s most prominent political families . For all of Mr. Clinton \u2019 s ebullient praise of Mr. Obama , he also was seen by some Democrats as setting the stage for his wife \u2019 s possible return to politics in 2016 , a prospect yearned for by many of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s supporters .\nHe made only a quick reference to his wife , drawing laughter from the crowd as he raised another attribute of Mr. Obama , declaring : \u201c Heck , he even appointed Hillary ! \u201d\nFor Mr. Clinton , the speech dramatized the evolution in his relationship with Mr. Obama , from bitter antagonism to cautious embrace and now a full-throated endorsement . People who know both men do not play down the lingering tension between them , a legacy of the 2008 Democratic primary , when Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. Clinton in a fierce battle that seemed to leave Mr. Clinton more wounded than his wife .\n\u201c President Obama beat Hillary Clinton for the nomination , \u201d said Rahm Emanuel , the mayor of Chicago , who worked for both men . \u201c President Clinton loves his wife . It took him a little longer to get over it ; she got a job . \u201d\nThis time , Mr. Clinton may have had the dual purpose of not only defending his wife \u2019 s boss , but also enhancing her political prospects , should she decide on another presidential run in 2016 . Mrs. Clinton , who plans to step down as secretary of state in January , was in Beijing on Wednesday , negotiating with the Chinese on Syria and the South China Sea .\nThe speech from Mr. Clinton concluded an evening that began on a discordant note when party leaders , at the behest of Mr. Obama , pushed through a vote to change language in their platform to affirm Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . With the hall noisily divided , it took three tries before the vote was declared passed , leaving some delegates grumbling and analysts saying that the organizers had botched the proceedings .\nThe Jerusalem reference , which was in the 2008 platform , had been dropped this year , prompting criticism from Republicans and pro-Israel groups . Mr. Obama , bowing to pressure , decided to restore the language , even though official American policy is that the status of Jerusalem should be resolved through negotiations .\nThe second night of the Democratic convention unfolded in a series of hard-hitting speeches aimed directly at the Republican ticket , with speaker after speaker assailing the records of Mr. Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan , his running mate .\nElizabeth Warren , the Democratic candidate for Senate in Massachusetts , delivered a forceful critique of Mr. Romney \u2019 s business background and invoked anti-Wall Street language to make her case on behalf of Mr. Obama , who she said would fight tirelessly for the middle class .\n\u201c People feel like the system is rigged against them , \u201d she said . \u201c And here \u2019 s the painful part : They \u2019 re right . The system is rigged . Look around . Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies . Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries . \u201d\nTightening their embrace of social issues , the Democrats also showcased Sandra Fluke , the Georgetown Law School graduate who earlier this year became a symbol of women \u2019 s reproductive rights in a fight over insurance coverage of contraception .\nHer speech , which was delayed so it would be included in the network \u2019 s prime-time coverage , lit into Mr. Romney and his running mate for their positions against abortion rights \u2014 and , in Mr. Romney \u2019 s case , for staying silent initially after the talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her a \u201c slut . \u201d\nOn the eve of Mr. Obama \u2019 s acceptance speech , a threat of rain and storms prompted convention organizers to move his speech from an outdoor rally at Bank of America Stadium on Thursday to the significantly smaller Time Warner Cable Arena , where the convention is being held .\nIt was a disappointment for the Obama campaign , which had been working for months to build a crowd of at least 65,000 supporters for the president \u2019 s speech .",
