    "content": "While President Obama campaigned on a promise that his universal health care plan would lower premiums , his controversial adviser and plan architect was privately warning the state of Wisconsin that Obamacare was poised to massively increase insurance costs for average residents , internal documents show .\nJonathan Gruber , the MIT economist currently under fire for suggesting the Obama administration tried to deceive the public about the Affordable Care Act , was hired by former Democratic Wisconsin Gov . Jim Doyle in 2010 to conduct an analysis on how the federal health-care reform would impact the state .\nMr. Gruber \u2019 s study predicted about 90 percent of individuals without employer-sponsored or public insurance would see their premiums spike by an average of 41 percent . Once tax subsidies were factored in , about 60 percent of those in the individual market were projected to see their premiums go up 31 percent , according to his analysis .\nIn addition , 53 percent of those insured by companies with fewer than 50 employees , would see their premiums rise by an average of 15 percent even after subsidies , Mr. Gruber forecasted . The report warned such increases could impact small companies \u2019 decision whether to provide health insurance to their workers .\n\u201c There remains some uncertainty about employer reactions given the many forces which might impact their decision to offer insurance , \u201d the report said .\nThe contrast between the Obama administration \u2019 s optimistic rhetoric on Obamacare and Mr. Gruber \u2019 s private warnings to Wisconsin is certain to attract new attention from the Republican-led Congress , which wants to know whether there was an effort by the administration to deceive the public about the true consequences of the law as Mr. Gruber suggested in a videotape that surfaced recently .\nMr. Gruber and the White House declined comment when contacted by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 this week .\nThe Gruber study , which was released publicly in August 2011 with little fanfare in the state of Wisconsin , was largely ignored by Mr. Obama , who campaigned in 2012 that insurance premiums would actually decrease under his healthcare legislation .\n\u201c So when you hear about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 and I don \u2019 t mind the name because I really do care . That \u2019 s why we passed it , \u201d the president declared in a campaign speech in Cincinnati , Ohio back in July 2012 , \u201c you should know that once we have fully implemented , you \u2019 re going to be able to buy insurance through a pool so that you can get the same good rates as a group that if you \u2019 re an employee at a big company you can get right now \u2014 which means your premiums will go down . \u201d\nIn Wisconsin , Republican Gov . Scott Walker , considered by many to be a potential 2016 presidential candidate , distrusted the campaign promises , largely because of the work Mr. Gruber had done for the state \u2019 s previous administration , and has long advocated for repealing the law .\nIn addition to premium rate increases , Mr. Gruber \u2019 s work estimated that 100,000 Wisconsinites would be involuntarily dropped from their employer sponsored health insurance also running counter to the President \u2019 s claim at the time that if a you liked their health-care policy , you could keep it .\nThe study did project the implementation of Obamacare would decrease the state \u2019 s number of uninsured by 65 percent by 2016 , but doing so would come at the expense of other groups .\nWisconsin \u2019 s working-class families would be forced to pay a hidden tax to pay for the purchase of health insurance for a family of four earning up to $ 89,400 , the study said . It also showed Obamacare would shrink the numbers of people in the private insurance marketplace from 180,000 individuals to 30,000 .\nMr. Walker has said he would like to see the Affordable Care Act repealed and after entering office in January 2011 , he opted not to create a state-run marketplace and to instead rely on the federal one . Mr. Walker also has refused Obamacare \u2019 s Medicaid expansion , refusing to accept federal aid offered under the Affordable Care Act , arguing he doesn \u2019 t trust the federal government \u2019 s pledge to cover the cost .\nAfter entering office , Mr. Walker replaced Mr. Doyle \u2019 s Office of Health Care Reform which had been created to carry out the federal Affordable Care Act with Wisconsin \u2019 s Office of Free Market Health Care . It was that office that inherited Mr. Gruber \u2019 s study .\nThe state of Wisconsin paid $ 443,718 to conduct the analysis with $ 200,000 going to Mr. Gruber himself , and the rest of the costs dedicated to Gorman Actuarial , a Massachusetts-based consultancy .\nMr. Gruber developed the model for the report that outlined the federal Affordable Care Act \u2019 s impact on Wisconsin , and his contract ended June 30 , 2011 , according to Mr. Walker \u2019 s office .\n\u201c Health care reform was supposed to provide affordable health care for Americans but major concerns have been demonstrated by the results of this study , \u201d said Dennis Smith , Wisconsin \u2019 s Health Services Secretary , in a press release when the report was released in August 2011 .\nThat year , Wisconsin had 33 health insurers actively participating in the individual market and 25 insurers in the small group market , a dynamic Mr. Walker \u2019 s administration thought competitive and cost effective .
