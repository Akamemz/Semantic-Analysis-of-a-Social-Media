That raises the question : Just how many would-be workers are unemployed for lengthy periods these days ?\nThe answer is a lot , even using the Labor Department \u2019 s official tally of the unemployed . And the number goes higher , because not all the long-term jobless are included in that mainstream count .\nSome 1.3 million Americans who have been out of work at least 26 weeks saw emergency benefits run dry on Dec. 28 , when year-end budget talks left the program an unresolved issue and it expired . By some estimates , another 3.6 million people are likely to enter the ranks of the long-term unemployed ( and to be eligible for the benefits if they reappear ) at some point during 2014 .\nThe total number of long-term unemployed goes beyond those eligible under an emergency benefits program , economists say . Consider that the program 's 1.3 million beneficiaries , late in 2013 , were just a fraction of the 4.1 million people whom the Labor Department counted as unemployed for more than 26 weeks . That larger group includes people who have already exhausted the extended benefits . Beyond the official long-term unemployed , more than 760,000 others are counted by the Labor Department as `` discouraged , '' meaning they have stopped looking for work .\nThat \u2019 s the backdrop for the current situation , in which many labor-market experts on both the left and right are supporting the restoration of emergency benefits .\n\u201c Simply put ... it \u2019 s much harder for the long-term unemployed to find a job right now than it has been in the past when emergency federal benefits were allowed to expire , \u201d writes Michael Strain of the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington .\nThe rationale behind unemployment insurance ( UI ) is to cushion workers and their families during the time it takes them to find a new job . In the current climate , another rationale for extending benefits is simply as an incentive for the jobless to not give up hope .\n\u201c It keeps them in the labor force looking for work , \u201d says Chad Stone , chief economist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington . People must keep up the job search to collect the support payments .\nBy contrast , dropping out of the job market tends to damage people \u2019 s earning prospects when they eventually try to jump back in , economists say . When that happens to a lot of Americans at once , it means lower productive potential for the whole economy .\n\u201c If we let emergency federal UI benefits expire , then the best guess based on the research is that more long-term unemployed workers will simply quit looking for a job and exit the labor force than will take a job they have been too choosy to take , \u201d Mr. Strain wrote recently in the National Review .\nUsually , the federal-state program called unemployment insurance provides income support for up to 26 weeks ( half a year ) after someone loses a job .
