Like Biden , Bush was closely associated with his party \u2019 s last president . Like Biden , Bush led in early polls . Like Biden , Bush struggled in debates . Like Biden , Bush performed horribly in Iowa , where he came in sixth , and New Hampshire , where he came in fourth . And , like Biden , Bush staked his candidacy on a comeback in South Carolina .\nBush \u2019 s strategy in the Palmetto State was similar to the one Biden employed last month : He made himself the defender of his party \u2019 s old guard . At a debate in South Carolina one week before voters there went to the polls , Bush drew a contrast between the insurgent Donald Trump \u2019 s nativism and former President George W. Bush \u2019 s more welcoming message . The \u201c great majority \u201d of immigrants , Jeb declared , \u201c are coming to provide for their families .
