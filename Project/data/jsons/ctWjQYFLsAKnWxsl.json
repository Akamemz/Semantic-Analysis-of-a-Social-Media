And even more striking is how he put his coalition together \u2014 he just did better than she did .\nHe did better in the suburbs of Washington , DC , but also better in the small cities of Richmond and Norfolk and in their suburbs . But he also did better in the small swath of Appalachia that cuts through Virginia . And he did better in the small , rural part of the state that constitutes the Southern end of the Delmarva Peninsula . The New York Times \u2019 s excellent map of the vote switch shows that Northam didn \u2019 t literally do better in every single precinct , but he did do better in the clear majority of them and in most regions of the state .\nThe lesson here is that most of the broad public handwringing about Democratic Party geographic and demographic targeting is misguided . Actual candidate and campaign professionals do need to make some fine-grained decisions about how to allocate resources . But much of the conversation about \u201c winning back \u201d working-class white voters versus pursuing new \u201c Panera Democrats \u201d in upscale suburbs is misguided .\nTrying to win in the Sunbelt versus trying to win in the Rust Belt is a false dichotomy . So is trying to mobilize people of color versus trying to make inroads in rural white areas . Nobody is equally popular everywhere and nobody ever will be . But winning campaigns tend to just do better in all kinds of places and with all kinds of voters than losing ones .\nBy age , for example , Northam crushed Ed Gillespie with younger voters while dramatically improving on Clinton \u2019 s already large margins \u2014 scoring 69 percent of the under 30 vote instead of 54 percent .\nBut he also did slightly better with the two oldest cohorts of voters . There was a distinct age skew to his appeal , in other words , but there was no sharp tradeoff where to win younger voters he had to alienate older ones .\nRace and education tell a similar story . Northam \u2019 s ultimate coalition reflects what \u2019 s basically a \u201c Panera \u201d strategy \u2014 pairing a slight edge with white college graduates and overwhelming majorities among nonwhites to overcome a large disadvantage among white working-class voters . That \u2019 s appropriate to the general course of national politics and to the particular demographics of Virginia .\nBut note that there was no particular path Northam took to his landslide . He did a lot better with white college graduates than Clinton did , but also somewhat better with non-white college graduates and with white non-graduates . He didn \u2019 t improve on Clinton \u2019 s already impressive majorities with working class minorities , but he didn \u2019 t lose ground here \u2014 and he drove solid turnout \u2014 even while increasing his appeal to both upscale and downscale whites .\nKeep scrolling through exit poll results and you keep seeing the same thing .\nNortham did better with low-income voters but also better with high-income ones .\nHe did better with Evangelicals but also better with non-Evangelicals .\nHe did better with working-class white men who swung hard to Trump in 2016 , but also with college educated white women who swung hard to Clinton .\nHe did better with married men and he did better with single women .\nHe just did better , which led to an overall larger margin of victory and paired with winning a lot more seats in the House of Delegates and flipping a bunch of County Council seats .\nThis was also a major lesson of the once-hyped , now-forgotten special election to replace Ryan Zinke as the House member from Montana . Democrats nominated an eccentric local guy , Rob Quist , who caught the attention of Bernie Sanders and the grassroots left of the Democratic Party as an alternative to the enthusiasm the party establishment had for Jon Ossoff \u2019 s campaign in the suburbs of Georgia .\nQuist ended up doing a lot better than Hillary Clinton while still falling considerably short of winning .\nMontana also conveniently has an incumbent Democratic governor who won in 2016 and who offers a counterpoint to both Quist and Clinton .

He did better in the rural deep-red part of the state . But he also did better in the areas with a large Native American population , in the college towns , and in what passes for cities by Montana standard . But the governor , Steve Bullock , a moderate-ish Democrat with a few populist views , a bolo tie , and a lot of personal charm and charisma , did even better than Quist in all of those places .\nIn other words , better , stronger candidates do better by doing better everywhere .
