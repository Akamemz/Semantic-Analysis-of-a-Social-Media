    "content": "There were 15 of them . Most arrived in the dead of night , laid their trap and waited for the target to arrive . That target was Jamal Khashoggi , a prominent Saudi critic of his country \u2019 s government and its young crown prince . Since his killing in Istanbul , Turkish media has released a steady drip feed of evidence implicating Saudi officials . Weeks of investigation by The Times builds on that evidence and reconstructs what unfolded , hour-by-hour . Our timeline shows the ruthless efficiency of a hit team of experts that seemed specially chosen from Saudi government ministries . Some had links to the crown prince himself . After a series of shifting explanations , Saudi Arabia now denies that this brazen hit job was premeditated . But this reconstruction of the killing , and the botched cover-up , calls their story into serious question . It \u2019 s Friday morning , Sept. 28 . Khashoggi and his fianc\u00e9e , Hatice Cengiz , are at the local marriage office in Istanbul . In order to marry , he \u2019 s told that he needs Saudi paperwork and goes straight to the consulate to arrange it . They tell him to return in a week . It all seems routine , but it \u2019 s not . Inside there \u2019 s a Saudi spy , Ahmed al-Muzaini , who \u2019 s working under diplomatic cover . That very day , he flies off to Riyadh and helps concoct a plan to intercept Khashoggi when he returns to the consulate . Fast-forward to Monday night into Tuesday morning . Saudi agents converge in Istanbul aboard separate flights . Muzaini , the spy , flies back from Riyadh . A commercial flight carries a three-man team that we believe flew from Cairo . Two of the men are security officers and they \u2019 ve previously traveled with the crown prince . A private jet flying from Riyadh lands around 3:30 a.m. That plane is often used by the Saudi government , and it \u2019 s carrying nine Saudi officials , some who played key roles in Khashoggi \u2019 s death . We \u2019 ll get to Team 3 later on , and for now focus on these men from Team 2 . This is Salah al-Tubaigy , a high-ranking forensics and autopsy expert in the Saudi interior ministry . Turkish officials will later say his role was to dismember Khashoggi \u2019 s body . Another is Mustafa al-Madani , a 57-year-old engineer . As we \u2019 ll see , it \u2019 s no accident that he looks like Khashoggi . And this is Maher Mutreb , the leader of the operation . Our investigation into his past reveals a direct link between Mutreb and the Saudi crown prince . When bin Salman toured a Houston neighborhood earlier this year , we discovered that Mutreb was with him , a glowering figure in the background . We found him again in Boston , at a U.N. meeting in New York , in Madrid and Paris , too . This global tour was all part of a charm offensive by the prince to paint himself as a moderate reformer . Back then , Mutreb was in the royal guard . Now , he would orchestrate Khashoggi \u2019 s killing . And his close ties to the crown prince beg the question , just how high up the Saudi chain of command did the plot to kill go ? Early Tuesday morning , Khashoggi flies back from a weekend trip to London . He and the Saudis nearly cross paths at the airport . The Saudi teams check into two hotels , which give quick access to the consulate . Khashoggi heads home with his fianc\u00e9e . He \u2019 d just bought an apartment for their new life together . By mid-morning , the Saudis are on the move . Mutreb leaves his hotel three hours before Khashoggi is due at the consulate . The rest of the team isn \u2019 t far behind . The building is only a few minutes away on foot , and soon , they \u2019 re spotted at this entrance . Mutreb arrives first . Next , we see al-Tubaigy , the autopsy expert . And now al-Madani , the lookalike . The stage is almost set . A diplomatic car pulls out of the consulate driveway and switches places with a van , which backs in . Turkish officials say this van would eventually carry away Khashoggi \u2019 s remains . From above , we can see the driveway is covered , hiding any activity around the van from public view . Meanwhile , Khashoggi and his fianc\u00e9e set out for the consulate , walking hand-in-hand . In their final hour together , they chat about dinner plans and new furniture for their home . At 1:13 p.m. , they arrive at the consulate . Khashoggi gives her his cellphones before he enters . He walks into the consulate . It \u2019 s the last time we see him . Inside , Khashoggi is brought to the consul general \u2019 s office on the second floor . The hit team is waiting in a nearby room . Sources briefed on the evidence , told us Khashoggi quickly comes under attack . He \u2019 s dragged to another room and is killed within minutes . Then al-Tubaigy , the autopsy expert , dismembers his body while listening to music . Maher Mutreb makes a phone call to a superior . He says , \u201c Tell your boss , \u201d and \u201c The deed was done. \u201d Outside , the van reportedly carrying Khashoggi \u2019 s body pulls out of the side entrance and drives away . At the same time , the Saudis begin trying to cover their tracks . While Khashoggi \u2019 s fianc\u00e9e waits here where she left him , two figures leave from the opposite side . One of them is wearing his clothes . Later , the Saudis would claim that this was Khashoggi . But it \u2019 s al-Madani , the engineer , now a body double pretending that the missing journalist left the consulate alive . Yet there \u2019 s one glaring flaw : The clothes are the same , but he \u2019 s wearing his own sneakers , the ones he walked in with . Meanwhile , the van that \u2019 s allegedly carrying Khashoggi \u2019 s body makes the two-minute drive from the consulate to the Saudi consul \u2019 s residence . There \u2019 s several minutes of deliberations but the van eventually pulls into the building \u2019 s driveway . Again , it \u2019 s hidden from public view . It \u2019 s now three hours since Khashoggi was last seen . The body double hails this taxi and continues weaving a false trail through the city . He heads to a popular tourist area and then changes back into his own clothes . Later , we see him joking around in surveillance footage . Over at the airport , more Saudi officials arrive on another flight from Riyadh . They spend just five hours in Istanbul , but we \u2019 re not sure where they go . Now we pick up Maher Mutreb again , exiting from the consul \u2019 s house . It \u2019 s time for them to go . Mutreb and others check out of their hotel and move through airport security . Al-Muzaini , the spy , heads to the airport too . But as they \u2019 re leaving Istanbul , Khashoggi \u2019 s fianc\u00e9e is still outside the consulate , pacing in circles . She \u2019 ll soon raise the alarm that Khashoggi is missing and she \u2019 ll wait for him until midnight . The alarm spreads around the world . Nine days later , the Saudis send another team to Istanbul . They say it \u2019 s to investigate what happened . But among them are a toxicologist and a chemist , who also has ties to the hit team . He and Tubaigy attended a forensics graduation days before Khashoggi was killed . Turkish officials later say that this team \u2019 s mission was not to investigate , but to cover up the killing . Now the Saudi story has changed , and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for several suspects in Khashoggi \u2019 s killing . But that doesn \u2019 t include Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , who many Western government officials are convinced authorized the killing . Khashoggi \u2019 s remains still haven \u2019 t been found .",
