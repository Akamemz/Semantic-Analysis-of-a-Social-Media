    "content": "Donald Trump is going to be the next president of the United States .\nThe billionaire businessman who never before held elected office shocked America and the world , defeating Hillary Clinton in an extraordinary rebuke to the nation \u2019 s political class after an ugly and divisive race that will go down as the most stunning upset in American history .\nTrump did so decisively , stomping across the electoral map with wins in the four biggest battlegrounds of Florida , North Carolina , Ohio and Pennsylvania . He defied the polls and pundits after a scorched-earth campaign against Clinton , the Republican establishment , and basic decorum , toppling the blue wall of states that Clinton had supposedly constructed to keep the White House in Democratic hands .\nThe nation , the markets and the world stood stunned , wondering what would come next . The Dow Futures sank as much as 750 points . The Mexico peso plunged .\n\u201c It is time for us to come together as one united people , \u201d Trump said in a victory speech , following a concession call from Clinton at nearly 3 a.m. Eastern . \u201c It \u2019 s time . \u201d\nTrump led an unseen rebellion of working-class voters , most of them white and so disgusted by a stalled status quo that they voted for a candidate promising dramatic change , even as Trump set disapproval records for a winning candidate . He also tapped into ethnic antagonism , vowing strict immigration controls , a ban on Muslims and a deportation force , promising an era of restoration .\n\u201c The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer , \u201d Trump declared .\nClinton had been heavily favored to win . She led national polls and in most battleground states heading into the election . Her allies were so confident that a supportive super PAC had actually redirected millions to other races .\nBut Trump had been underestimated from the first day of his candidacy , when he descended the gilded escalators of Trump Tower to bash Mexican immigrants as \u201c rapists. \u201d He went on to dispatch 16 rivals in the Republican primary before mounting a vicious campaign against Clinton in which he paraded her husband \u2019 s infidelities , repeatedly called her corrupt and questioned whether she could govern as a woman .\nFor 17 months , the reality television showman mesmerized the public with his unvarnished tweets , constant television presence and raucous mass rallies . His full-throttle grip on the national imagination enriched the news media and eroded standards of political civility .\nIt made him a hero to his fans . And they voted in droves .\nIn Mahoning County , a longtime Democratic stronghold and the home of Youngstown , Ohio , Trump held Clinton to roughly 50 percent . President Obama had carried the county with 63.2 percent of the vote . That was the story in place after place , as Trump sliced deeply into once large Democratic margins and built massive leads among rural voters .\n\u201c This is a movement . It 's more than a normal political election , \u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions , the Alabama Republican who was the first GOP senator to endorse Trump in late February . \u201c It transcends normal party politics . \u201d\nFor Clinton , the loss is especially brutal . She had meticulously planned her victory party at the Javits Center in Manhattan , symbolically under an enormous glass ceiling that she hoped to break through .

They cheered every time a small state was called for Clinton , but those times were few and far between . She won Colorado and Virginia , but little else that was competitive .\nInstead , they watched as state after state ticked into Trump \u2019 s column , her chance of becoming the first woman president snatched away by a man caught on tape bragging about groping women , and then accused in recent weeks by a dozen of doing just that .\nAcross town , at the Trump party , the buzz was building .
