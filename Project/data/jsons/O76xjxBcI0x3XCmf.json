    "content": "Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru and St. James School v. Biel , are difficult cases , which the Court will hear in a rare teleconferenced oral argument next Monday . They concern whether two Catholic school teachers qualify as \u201c ministers , \u201d and are therefore beyond the reach of workplace civil rights laws .\nIn Hosanna-Tabor v. EEOC ( 2012 ) , the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment enshrines a \u201c ministerial exemption \u201d to anti-discrimination laws . As Chief Justice John Roberts explained for the Court in Hosanna-Tabor , the Constitution \u2019 s \u201c Establishment Clause prevents the Government from appointing ministers , and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with the freedom of religious groups to select their own . \u201d\nThis prohibition on laws regulating how religious groups choose their own ministers is so broad that it even permits such groups to engage in invidious discrimination . A church may fire a minister , for example , because that minister is black , or because they are gay , or because they \u2019 ve become pregnant , even though federal law prohibits race and pregnancy discrimination , and many states have laws barring anti-LGBTQ discrimination .\nBut it \u2019 s also far from clear who qualifies as a \u201c minister , \u201d which is where Biel and Morrissey-Berru come in . Though there are some religious leaders \u2014 priests , rabbis , imams , and the like \u2014 who rather obviously qualify as ministers , what about someone with significant religious duties who spends most of their time engaged in secular work ? What about someone who may spend a few hours a week providing religious instruction , but who has no formal training in theology and no formal status as an ordained minister ?\nBoth Biel and Morrissey-Berru involve Catholic school teachers who claim that they lost their jobs for illegitimate reasons . Kristen Biel was diagnosed with breast cancer and has since died . Her estate claims that her teaching contract was not renewed because of her cancer diagnosis , in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act . The school claims she was removed because she \u201c was not strict \u201d enough in her classroom discipline .\nAgnes Morrissey-Berru , meanwhile , says her contract was not renewed due to age discrimination . The school claims a mix of reasons for removing her , including financial concerns and concerns that her teaching had insufficient \u201c academic rigor . \u201d\nBut the real reason these women \u2019 s contracts were not renewed is not before the Supreme Court . The Court will confront whether Biel and Morrissey-Berru count as ministers \u2014 and therefore are beyond the reach of laws banning disability and age discrimination . And the question of whether either woman qualifies as a \u201c minister \u201d turns out to be devilishly hard to answer under the Supreme Court \u2019 s sole precedent dealing with the ministerial exception .\nAnd , in case it is not yet clear , the stakes in these cases are profound . If an employee is classified as a \u201c minister , \u201d they effectively lose their rights to be free from discrimination in the workplace . If the Court permits large swaths of workers to be classified as \u201c ministers , \u201d it could open the floodgates to widespread discrimination .\nThe purpose of the ministerial exemption is to prevent the government from , in the words of Hosanna-Tabor , \u201c depriving the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs. \u201d Hosanna-Tabor , moreover , was a unanimous decision , so there is widespread consensus among both liberal and conservative judges that some form of ministerial exemption to civil rights laws is mandated by the Constitution .\nBut Hosanna-Tabor also does not offer clear guidance on who qualifies as a minister , in no small part because it was a fairly easy case .\nLike Biel and Morrissey-Berru , Hosanna-Tabor involved a teacher at a religious school . In determining that this teacher did qualify as a minister , the Supreme Court laid out several factors that courts could consider when determining if a particular employee fits within the ministerial exception . Did the employer hold the employee out as a minister , and did the employee do the same ? Did the employee have significant religious training ? Did their job duties involve \u201c important religious functions \u201d ?\nAll these factors pointed in one direction in Hosanna-Tabor . The plaintiff in that case was a teacher at a Lutheran school that gave her the title \u201c Minister of Religion , Commissioned. \u201d She \u2019 d completed \u201c eight college-level courses in subjects including biblical interpretation , church doctrine , and the ministry of the Lutheran teacher , \u201d and had to pass an examination administered by Lutheran faculty . She taught some religious subjects . She led her students in prayer , and she occasionally led chapel services . She \u2019 d also claimed a tax benefit for workers who earn their income \u201c in the exercise of the ministry . \u201d\nGiven these lopsided facts , the Supreme Court had little difficulty concluding that the Hosanna-Tabor plaintiff was a minister .\nBiel and Morrissey-Berru , by contrast , involve much more marginal claims that two religious school teachers qualify as ministers . Both women received bachelor \u2019 s degrees in secular subjects , although Morrissey-Berru did take \u201c catechist courses \u201d provided by Los Angeles \u2019 s Catholic archdiocese . And both women were classified by their schools as \u201c lay employees . \u201d\nMeanwhile , both women did provide some religious instruction to their students \u2014 though , at least in Biel \u2019 s case , her religious teaching duties appear to have been fairly minimal . According to the lawyers for her estate , Biel taught religion \u201c for approximately thirty minutes a day , four days a week , \u201d and she did so from a workbook mandated by her school .\nThe question in Biel and Morrissey-Berru , in other words , is whether the ministerial exemption applies when some but not all of the factors identified in Hosanna-Tabor also apply to the alleged ministers at the heart of those cases .\nThe opposing sides propose wildly different tests for determining who qualifies as a minister\nThe Catholic schools hoping to classify Biel and Morrissey-Berru as ministers , unsurprisingly , propose an expansive test for who fits within the ministerial exception : \u201d When an employee of a religious organization performs important religious functions , \u201d the schools argue , \u201c that is enough under Hosanna-Tabor for the ministerial exception to apply . \u201d\nAnd what qualifies as an \u201c important religious function \u201d ? To answer this question , the schools look to Justice Samuel Alito \u2019 s concurring opinion in Hosanna-Tabor , which suggests that employees \u201c who serve in positions of leadership , those who perform important functions in worship services and in the performance of religious ceremonies and rituals , and those who are entrusted with teaching and conveying the tenets of the faith to the next generation \u201d all qualify as ministers .\nThus , if a schoolteacher teaches religious subjects , even for just a couple of hours a week , that is enough to qualify the teacher as a minister . A teacher may even qualify as a minister if they are required to lead their students in prayer , as these prayers could qualify as \u201c important functions in worship services and in the performance of religious ceremonies and rituals . \u201d\nLawyers for the two teachers , meanwhile , suggest a less expansive test . For one thing , they ask the Supreme Court to place much more emphasis on \u201c formalistic , objective indicia of ministerial status \u201d such as whether an employer explicitly designated a particular employee as a minister , and whether the employee had formal religious training . Among other things , this reliance on formal criteria offers a fair warning to employees who are subject to the ministerial exception .\nAs the lawyers for the two teachers write , \u201c an employee should not discover on the day of her dismissal that her employer is entitled to fire her for becoming pregnant or sick\u2014or just becoming older . \u201d\nYet these lawyers also acknowledge that a test relying solely on formal criteria is insufficient . They concede that \u201c in our pluralistic society , some churches have unorthodox hierarchies , and others may not use familiar titles or nomenclature. \u201d Accordingly , they recognize that courts must pay some attention to the \u201c religious functions \u201d performed by a particular employee to determine if that employee is a minister .\nOne thing that becomes painfully clear , after reading both briefs , is that coming up with a satisfying way to sort out which employees should qualify as ministers is hard . As the plaintiffs \u2019 lawyers acknowledge , a test that relies too heavily on formal criteria like whether a particular employee was ordained as a minister is not compatible with faiths that have \u201c unorthodox hierarchies . \u201d\nEmployers , moreover , could find it fairly easy to game such a test . If courts place a heavy emphasis on which employees are formally designated as ministers , that gives religious employers a strong incentive to designate every employee as a minister \u2014 in order to immunize itself from lawsuits alleging employment discrimination .\nThe schools \u2019 proposed test , meanwhile , is even easier to game . Indeed , some religious denominations and conservative law firms have already published guides advising religious employers on how to game such a test .\nConsider a manual published by the Southern Baptist Convention and the Alliance Defending Freedom . That manual , titled Protecting Your Ministry From Sexual Orientation Gender Identity Lawsuits , suggested that even employees such as a receptionist could be reclassified as \u201c ministers \u201d by a sufficiently creative employer :\nWhen feasible , a religious organization should assign its employees duties that involve ministerial teaching , or other spiritual qualifications \u2014 duties that directly further the religious mission . For example , if a church receptionist answers the phone , the job description might detail how the receptionist is required to answer basic questions about the church \u2019 s faith , provide religious resources , or pray with callers . Consider requiring all employees to participate in devotional or prayer time , or to even lead these on occasion .\nSo the Supreme Court faces an unenviable task in Biel and Morrissey-Berru . It needs to offer lower courts some guidance on when an employee with a mix of secular and religious duties qualifies as a minister , and how much leeway religious employers should have to designate vast swaths of their workforce as ministers .\nAnd the stakes here are high , since any employee classified as a minister loses their legal protections against invidious discrimination .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .
