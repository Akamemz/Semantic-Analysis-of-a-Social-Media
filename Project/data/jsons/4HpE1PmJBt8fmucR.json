    "content": "Mark Bauerlein is an English professor at Emory University and senior editor at First Things journal .\nIn my household , when the holidays come , the usual family members plus a friend or two gather . We have three generations at the table : two female 80-year-olds , some 50-year-olds and the millennials . Only one of us is a Trump supporter . This is , after all , a family of professionals in a Northeastern coastal city .\nBut it takes only one Trumper to turn a genial dinner into an emotional contest of wills . It doesn \u2019 t matter that the holidays call for love and gratitude . We may try to talk about other things\u2014our lives , our jobs , the weather\u2014but Trump won \u2019 t go unmentioned . The feelings he arouses are too stormy . This week , we should expect lots of politics along with our turkey and stuffing .\nLast year at Thanksgiving , two weeks after the Big Surprise , it wasn \u2019 t so bad . Hillary Clinton \u2019 s supporters were still in shock . President Barack Obama had two months to go . Some on the left believed that , surely , something would emerge between then and the inauguration that would keep the unthinkable from happening . And there were outlets for liberal dismay and fear , too , marches to join and websites on which to vent . I stepped out to Manhattan \u2019 s Second Avenue around that time and watched a small parade heading north , I presume , to one of Trump \u2019 s East Side towers . They were softly singing \u201c We Shall Overcome . \u201d\nThe mood at the 2016 holiday table , then , was disbelief , not outrage . A year later , though , he 's still there . Roe is in trouble , and so are trans soldiers , and public schools , and the environment \u2026 and white supremacists are emboldened .\nI \u2019 m the inexplicable presence in the room , a specimen of something that shouldn \u2019 t be . How in the world can an educated person\u2014a teacher , for goodness \u2019 sake\u2014back such a stupid , bigoted , alpha-male blowhard ? That \u2019 s the question that won \u2019 t go away . My mother will talk about his macho manner . My sister will recount the latest fumbles by his Cabinet . My nephew and his wife will fret over what he \u2019 ll do to science . Everything runs smoothly until I say , \u201c Did n't you love Trump \u2019 s speech in Warsaw ? Isn \u2019 t it great to have a leader willing to praise Western civilization ? \u201d\nThat does it . The communal spell is broken . I \u2019 ve ruined Thanksgiving . Forget the Warsaw speech\u2014it \u2019 s the bare fact of dissent that counts . My mother will wrinkle her brow and mutter , \u201c Oh , gawd. \u201d The millennials at the table will go blank ( Western civilization was dropped as a school subject before they were born ) . My sister shall return to Trump pulling back on environmental regulation , which she regards as abominable .\nI imagine similar scenes at holiday tables all across America . According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this month , nearly a third of American adults will try to avoid political topics during the holidays this year . My family is just one window into understanding why . Any career woman , especially a single one , who entered the workforce in 1970 is never , ever going to look at Donald Trump as anything but a sexist bully . She remembers too many ill-mannered bosses and co-workers , condescending males who , when they didn \u2019 t hit on her , dismissed or exploited her . My mother made a go of it and put up with a lot . Those humiliations don \u2019 t fade .\nThis is not something to dispute . I spent last New Year \u2019 s Eve at a faculty party in Massachusetts , where a woman who was about 70 described that fateful morning when she woke up to find that Hillary had lost . ( It is important that she and Hillary were the same age\u2014here , for once , was a candidate who knew what it was like to be an ambitious young woman in 1970 . ) Astonishment led to disappointment , and then to fright . Her horror reminded me of Yeats \u2019 lines , \u201c And what rough beast , its hour come round at last . . . ? \u201d But , she told us , she sauntered down to the beach , sat on the sand , marked the sea and sky , and mumbled , \u201c It \u2019 s going to be OK , it \u2019 s going to be OK , it \u2019 s going to be OK. \u201d Clearly , her reaction had a genesis that started long before November 2016 . I never once showed my political sympathies during that particular dinner .\nThe young ones at the holiday table have a different experience , but it \u2019 s no less foreign to me . You see , a 25-year-old has no real memory of any president except Barack Obama . George W. Bush is just a name . They cast their first votes for Obama , and their second ( millennials tend to skip the midterms ) . Obama was not a politician to them : He was the realization of everything millennials believed about the world and about themselves . They are the first generation to have brought tolerance and inclusivity down to Earth ( they \u2019 ll tell you so ) .They will not stand for racism . Patriotism is a minor concern , because they think it wrong to favor the poor farmer upstate over the poor farmer in Africa . Everyone deserves to be happy .\nBarack Obama in the White House was vindication of their faith . In 2008 , the youth vote ( 18-to-29-year-olds ) favored him over McCain 66 percent to 31 percent ! This was hero worship . The first black president , a guy who listens to rap and shoots hoops , likes Mad Men and knows how to deliver a punchline , who stops discrimination and frustrates haters , who frees the harassed and victimized \u2026 this was what American leadership should always be .\nDonald Trump can impress them only as a throwback , a mean , atavistic clod . They don \u2019 t care for Hillary , especially . It \u2019 s the loss of Obama that distresses them . Set the orange-haired tweeter alongside the cool , composed law professor and a mighty void hits home . The millennials had a charmed political youth for eight years . Now , as they see it , they enter their thirties with a guy who likes walls , guns and threats .\nTo my fellow Trump supporters , a word of advice : Think about the experiences that lie behind the rancor you might face as you dine and relax with your loved ones this season . Arguments will not end well . Everyone has a life story , a wellspring of pain and triumph that won \u2019 t yield easily to debate . Trump has violated them too deeply .\nBut you have a life story , too , one that led you toward Trump , not away from him . When I first saw identity politics at work , I was a graduate student in English at UCLA in the 1980s . These were the years when the heritage of genius and beauty was recast as a bunch of Dead White Males . Western civilization slipped from a lineage of reason and talent , free inquiry and unsuppressed creativity , into \u201c Eurocentrism , \u201d one group \u2019 s advance at the expense of others , women and people of color . Art for art \u2019 s sake gave way to art for politics \u2019 sake , for identity \u2019 s sake . I spent my 20s in a grimy room reading Dante , Wordsworth and Nietzsche\u2014only to find when I went to campus that my intellectual giants had become objects of suspicion and derision .\nWhen Donald Trump stood in that square in Warsaw and unapologetically hailed Western civilization , I felt a 30-year discouragement lift ever so slightly . That \u2019 s my experience , and I \u2019 m happy to share it this season .\nBut I want to hear about the personal circumstances behind my relatives \u2019 politics , too . I can ask the younger ones next to me , \u201c What did Obama \u2019 s 2008 campaign mean to you ? \u201d and we don \u2019 t need to fight about it . I can say to my mother , \u201c What was it like to be the first female real estate agent in the company ? \u201d and avoid the disagreements of the present entirely .\nThese questions are not an avoidance of politics ; they get to the foundation of politics . And if conversations run in that deeper direction , instead of to today \u2019 s controversies , then this year \u2019 s gatherings may , in fact , prove more meaningful and intimate than ever .\nSo , talk about Trump all you want at your Thanksgiving dinner . Just be sure to listen to what your crazy uncle/father-in-law/niece/cousin is really saying .",
