Stop letting all the \u201c bad news \u201d that floods your mobile phone or TV make you forget there \u2019 s a lot of good news out there that makes a bigger difference to all of us in the long run .\nKeeping a resolution against letting bad news dominate your media consumption won \u2019 t be easy . There \u2019 s an old saying among editors that \u201c if it bleeds , it leads , \u201d and 90 percent of news is negative because that \u2019 s what interests us .\nNOEL YEATTS : NEW YEAR 'S RESOLUTIONS THAT MATTER \u2014 FOUR WAYS YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD\nDaniel Kahneman , who shared a Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 , first noted that human nature has saddled us with some baggage .

In 2014 , the Russian news site City Reporter decided to cover only good news and silver linings for an entire day . It lost two-thirds of its normal readership that day . When I was growing up in California , a businessman in my hometown launched `` The Good News , '' an unrelentingly cheerful weekly paper that found subscribers in 50 states and 10 countries . But it went broke in 16 months .\nSo it may be obvious that calling on news outlets to publish more \u201c good news \u201d isn \u2019 t going to trump human nature .

Seriously . '' His thesis is clear : `` We are living through the greatest improvement in human living standards in history . Extreme poverty has fallen below 10 percent of the world \u2019 s population for the first time . It was 60 per cent when I was born . Global inequality has been plunging as Africa and Asia experience faster economic growth than Europe and North America ; child mortality has fallen to record low levels ; famine virtually went extinct ; malaria , polio and heart disease are all in decline .

For example , thanks to better irrigation and technology , we use 65 percent less land to produce the same amount of food we did 50 years ago .\nRidley points out the good news on using fewer resources that sits in our own hands : \u201c Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the 1970s . I use mine instead of a camera , radio , torch , compass , map , calendar , watch , CD player , newspaper and pack of cards . \u201d\nFor most of my life , I \u2019 ve grown up hearing doomsayers saying we are running out of energy . How many people grasp that the shale oil revolution and the explosion of renewable energy has brought the U.S. to the edge of being a net energy exporter ?\nTime Magazine may make Greta Thunberg its `` Person of the Year , '' but that obscures the news that U.S. carbon emissions actually declined in the last decade . Natural gas emits half as much carbon as coal , and as the U.S. Energy Information Administration points out , it was the `` largest source , '' or about 35 percent , of U.S. electricity in 2018 . Coal dropped from 45 percent in 2010 to 25 percent in 2019 , and may drop to 22 percent in 2020 .\nRidley points out that we could make even more progress on carbon emissions if environmental opposition to the newer , safer generation of nuclear power was n't so intense . Nuclear power uses the least land , least fuel and the least in building materials of any form of energy generation . As for the future , Ridley notes , \u201c It is now possible that nuclear fusion will one day deliver energy in minimalist form , using very little fuel and land . \u201d\nSo by all means , let us not tune out the slinging of political mud in the coming campaign or the natural disasters that take human life . But let \u2019 s all resolve to put it all into some context , and carry with us the realization that human progress continues .\nRidley , the author of the book \u201c The Rational Optimist , \u201d predicts that at the end of the 2020s \u201c we will see less poverty , less child mortality , less land devoted to agriculture in the world . There will be more tigers , whales , forests and nature reserves .
