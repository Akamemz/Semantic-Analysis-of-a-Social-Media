    "content": "Hillary Clinton addresses staff and supporters about the results of the presidential election in New York City , November 9 , 2016 . ( Brian Snyder/Reuters )\nDemocrats scoffed at charges of \u2018 election rigging \u2019 until they needed an excuse for Hillary Clinton \u2019 s unexpected defeat .\nAs we \u2019 ve seen , candidates can get chirpy at final presidential debates less than three weeks from Election Day , and Hillary Clinton was no exception . What \u201c horror \u201d had her inveighing so ? The very thought that her Republican rival would question the legitimacy of the presidential election .\nDonald Trump being Donald Trump , he wouldn \u2019 t budge . He would not pledge to accept the election results a priori . Okay , no , Trump didn \u2019 t use the phase a priori . But he did speculate that the electoral process could be rigged . Until he saw how it played out , the Republican nominee said , he could not concede that the outcome would be on the up-and-up .\nFirst , he reaffirmed an allegation for which he \u2019 d already been roundly condemned : Foreigners could swing the election \u2014 specifically , \u201c millions \u201d of ineligible voters , an allusion to illegal immigration , the pi\u00f1ata of Trump \u2019 s campaign . Second , he complained about the gross one-sidedness of the media \u2019 s campaign coverage : scathing when it came to him , and between inattentive and fawning when it came to his opponent , whose considerable sins were airbrushed away . Third , he claimed there was deep corruption : Clinton , he maintained , should not have been permitted to run , given the evidence of felony misconduct uncovered in her email scandal . Instead of prosecuting her , law-enforcement agencies of the Democratic administration bent over backwards to give her a pass , and congressional Democrats closed ranks around her , conducting themselves in committee hearings more like her defense lawyers than like investigators searching for the truth .\nA flabbergasted Clinton responded that she was shocked \u2014 horrified \u2014 to hear Trump \u201c talking down our democracy \u201d this way . This was a top theme in her campaign \u2019 s closing days : The election was absolutely legitimate ; Trump was traitorously condemnable for refusing to say so .\nOf course , Clinton and the Democrats who parroted her would prefer that you forget that now . And given her strained relationship with the truth , they \u2019 re right to suspect that you \u2019 d never retain anything she said for very long . The media\u2013Democrat caterwauling over Trump \u2019 s election-rigging spiel was not rooted in patriotic commitment to the American democratic tradition of accepting election outcomes . They said what they said because they fully expected to win . The polls all said they would . Mrs. Clinton and her backers , President Obama included , would not abide a taint of illegitimacy affixing itself to her inevitable presidency .\nExcept it wasn \u2019 t so inevitable . And when Clinton lost , they changed their tune about election-rigging . Suddenly , the inconceivable , the heresy-even-to-hint-at , was to be taken as gospel : The outcome was illegitimate ! Russia hacked the election !\nThere was , however , a very inconvenient problem for this narrative : Everything of significance that is known to the U.S. government about Russian meddling was already known in those pre-election weeks when Clinton and the Democrats were vouching for the integrity of the process and condemning Trump for even hesitating to endorse it .\nBy now , the story is well known . Russia \u2019 s cyberespionage operations began in 2014 , long before Donald Trump \u2019 s entry into the race . By summer 2015 , hackers believed to be connected to Russian intelligence agencies had access to DNC computer networks , and the FBI began warning DNC officials of this in September of that year \u2014 albeit with a lack of urgency that now seems stunning . In March 2016 came the hacking of a private email account belonging to John Podesta , Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s campaign chairman , who was sufficiently versed in cyber privacy issues to have authored a 2014 report on the subject while serving as a top Obama White House adviser .\nU.S. intelligence agencies were intimately aware of the penetrations . Obama \u2019 s national intelligence director , James Clapper , publicly acknowledged that hackers appeared to have targeted presidential campaigns . By August 2016 , CIA director John Brennan had interpreted streams of foreign intelligence to indicate that Putin had personally ordered the cyber thefts with the intention of at least damaging Clinton , if not flipping the election to Trump . In a phone call , Brennan is said to have admonished Alexander Bortnikov , the head of Russia \u2019 s security service ( the FSB ) , to desist . The next month , in a face-to-face confrontation ( through interpreters ) at an international conference in China , Obama warned Putin that \u201c we knew what he was doing and [ he ] better stop it or else. \u201d Meanwhile , the administration conducted numerous high-level , close-hold meetings , weighing several options including retaliatory cyber attacks .\nUltimately , Obama decided to do nothing . The president \u2019 s political allies and media admirers are now embarrassed about his inaction \u2014 \u201c It is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend .
