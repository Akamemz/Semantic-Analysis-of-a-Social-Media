The much-delayed and disputed results from Iowa have already altered the race: Joe Biden, who has been the national frontrunner for months, had to square off against his rivals after finishing fourth in the caucus, while Sen.

Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang were all hoping to make it into the top three.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the debate, as the candidates head into the final weekend of campaigning.\n\n1. Biden sets expectations low\n\nJoe Biden at the Democratic presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., on Friday night.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nIt happens after almost every Democratic debate: Klobuchar turns in what pundits rate as a strong performance, she gets praised in the media, and it makes little to no difference in her polling or fundraising. Klobuchar stuck to her message Friday night: Every time she\u2019s been on the ticket in Minnesota, she does well in traditionally Republican areas, pulling down-ballot Democrats up with her. She had a strong closing statement, repeatedly contrasted her experience with Buttigieg and didn\u2019t face questions about her record as a prosecutor that have been raised by civil-rights advocates in Minneapolis.

We will find out Tuesday night if her attacks on Buttigieg were enough to curb his momentum among Granite State voters and give her a bump. Early returns were positive, as Klobuchar\u2019s campaign said that she had raised more money during this debate than any prior one before it had even ended.\n\nAdam Glanzman/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n_____\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:",
