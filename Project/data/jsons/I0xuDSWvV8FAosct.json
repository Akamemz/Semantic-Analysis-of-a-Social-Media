I want to congratulate Heather , and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country ! '' the president tweeted Friday .\nThe 48-year-old would replace Ambassador Nikki Haley who has been a vocal advocate for US foreign policy \u2013 and a strong supporter of Israel at the UN .\nIt 's a tradition Sam Brownback , the US ambassador for International Religious Freedom , is confident Nauert will continue .

But conservatives deem her tenure at the UN to be a huge success .\nStill , critics like Indiana University international relations professor David Bosco are opposing the move . He tells USA Today , `` Her only real foreign policy is this stint at the State Department in a kind of spokesperson role .
