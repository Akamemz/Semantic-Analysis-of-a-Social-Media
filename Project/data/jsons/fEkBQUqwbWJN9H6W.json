That outlet was prominently in the news this week thanks to its \u201c bombshell \u201d story about President Trump and Michael Cohen : a story that , like so many others of its kind , blew up in its face , this time when the typically mute Robert Mueller \u2019 s office took the extremely rare step to label its key claims \u201c inaccurate. \u201d But in homage to BuzzFeed \u2019 s past viral glory , following are the top ten worst media failures in two-plus-years of Trump/Russia reporting . They are listed in reverse order , as measured by the magnitude of the embarrassment , the hysteria they generated on social media and cable news , the level of journalistic recklessness that produced them , and the amount of damage and danger they caused . This list was extremely difficult to compile in part because news outlets ( particularly CNN and MSNBC ) often delete from the internet the video segments of their most embarrassing moments . Even more challenging was the fact that the number of worthy nominees is so large that highly meritorious entrees had to be excluded , but are acknowledged at the end with ( dis ) honorable mention status . Note that all of these \u201c errors \u201d go only in one direction : namely , exaggerating the grave threat posed by Moscow and the Trump circle \u2019 s connection to it . It \u2019 s inevitable that media outlets will make mistakes on complex stories . If that \u2019 s being done in good faith , one would expect the errors would be roughly 50/50 in terms of the agenda served by the false stories . That is most definitely not the case here . Just as was true in 2002 and 2003 , when the media clearly wanted to exaggerate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and thus all of its \u201c errors \u201d went in that direction , virtually all of its major \u201c errors \u201d in this story are devoted to the same agenda and script : 10 .

CNN Explicitly Lied About Lanny Davis Being Its Source \u2013 For a Story Whose Substance Was Also False : Cohen Would Testify that Trump Knew in Advance About the Trump Tower Meeting ( CNN ) On July 27 , 2018 , CNN published a blockbuster story : that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell Robert Mueller that President Trump knew in advanced about the Trump Tower meeting . There were , however , two problems with this story : first , CNN got caught blatantly lying when its reporters claimed that \u201c contacted by CNN , one of Cohen \u2019 s attorneys , Lanny Davis , declined to comment \u201d ( in fact , Davis was one of CNN \u2019 s key sources , if not its only source , for this story ) , and second , numerous other outlets retracted the story after the source , Davis , admitted it was a lie .

Donald Trump Jr. Was Offered Advanced Access to the WikiLeaks Email Archive ( CNN/MSNBC ) The morning of December 9 , 2017 , launched one of the most humiliating spectacles in the history of the U.S. media . With a tone so grave and bombastic that it is impossible to overstate , CNN went on the air and announced a major exclusive : Donald Trump , Jr. was offered by email advanced access to the trove of DNC and Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks \u2013 meaning before those emails were made public . Within an hour , MSNBC \u2019 s Ken Dilanian , using a tone somehow even more unhinged , purported to have \u201c independently confirmed \u201d this mammoth , blockbuster scoop , which , they said , would have been the smoking gun showing collusion between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over the hacked emails ( while the YouTube clips have been removed , you can still watch one of the amazing MSNBC videos here ) . There was , alas , just one small problem with this massive , blockbuster story : it was totally and completely false . The email which Trump , Jr. received that directed him to the WikiLeaks archive was sent after WikiLeaks published it online for the whole world to see , not before . Rather than some super secretive operative giving Trump , Jr. advanced access , as both CNN and MSNBC told the public for hours they had confirmed , it was instead just some totally pedestrian message from a random member of the public suggesting Trump , Jr. review documents the whole world was already talking about . All of the anonymous sources CNN and MSNBC cited somehow all got the date of the email wrong . To date , when asked how they both could have gotten such a massive story so completely wrong in the same way , both CNN and MSNBC have adopted the posture of the CIA by maintaining complete silence and refusing to explain how it could possibly be that all of their \u201c multiple , independent sources \u201d got the date wrong on the email in the same way , to be as incriminating \u2013 and false \u2013 as possible . Nor , needless to say , will they identify their sources who , in concert , fed them such inflammatory and utterly false information . Sadly , CNN and MSNBC have deleted most traces of the most humiliating videos from the internet , including demanding that YouTube remove copies . But enough survives to document just what a monumental , horrifying , and utterly inexcusable debacle this was . Particularly amazing is the clip of the CNN reporter ( see below ) having to admit the error for the first time , as he awkwardly struggles to pretend that it \u2019 s not the massive , horrific debacle that it so obviously is :\nKnowingly soliciting or receiving anything of value from a foreign national for campaign purposes violates the Federal Election Campaign Act .

CNN Explicitly Lied About Lanny Davis Being Its Source \u2013 For a Story Whose Substance Was Also False: Cohen Would Testify that Trump Knew in Advance About the Trump Tower Meeting (CNN) On July 27, 2018, CNN published a blockbuster story: that Michael Cohen was prepared to tell Robert Mueller that President Trump knew in advanced about the Trump Tower meeting. There were, however, two problems with this story: first, CNN got caught blatantly lying when its reporters claimed that \u201ccontacted by CNN, one of Cohen\u2019s attorneys, Lanny Davis, declined to comment\u201d (in fact, Davis was one of CNN\u2019s key sources, if not its only source, for this story), and second, numerous other outlets retracted the story after the source, Davis, admitted it was a lie. CNN, however, to this date has refused to do either:\n\n2.

Donald Trump Jr. Was Offered Advanced Access to the WikiLeaks Email Archive (CNN/MSNBC) The morning of December 9, 2017, launched one of the most humiliating spectacles in the history of the U.S. media. With a tone so grave and bombastic that it is impossible to overstate, CNN went on the air and announced a major exclusive: Donald Trump, Jr. was offered by email advanced access to the trove of DNC and Podesta emails published by WikiLeaks \u2013 meaning before those emails were made public. Within an hour, MSNBC\u2019s Ken Dilanian, using a tone somehow even more unhinged, purported to have \u201cindependently confirmed\u201d this mammoth, blockbuster scoop, which, they said, would have been the smoking gun showing collusion between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks over the hacked emails (while the YouTube clips have been removed, you can still watch one of the amazing MSNBC videos here). There was, alas, just one small problem with this massive, blockbuster story: it was totally and completely false. The email which Trump, Jr. received that directed him to the WikiLeaks archive was sent after WikiLeaks published it online for the whole world to see, not before. Rather than some super secretive operative giving Trump, Jr. advanced access, as both CNN and MSNBC told the public for hours they had confirmed, it was instead just some totally pedestrian message from a random member of the public suggesting Trump, Jr. review documents the whole world was already talking about. All of the anonymous sources CNN and MSNBC cited somehow all got the date of the email wrong. To date, when asked how they both could have gotten such a massive story so completely wrong in the same way, both CNN and MSNBC have adopted the posture of the CIA by maintaining complete silence and refusing to explain how it could possibly be that all of their \u201cmultiple, independent sources\u201d got the date wrong on the email in the same way, to be as incriminating \u2013 and false \u2013 as possible. Nor, needless to say, will they identify their sources who, in concert, fed them such inflammatory and utterly false information. Sadly, CNN and MSNBC have deleted most traces of the most humiliating videos from the internet, including demanding that YouTube remove copies. But enough survives to document just what a monumental, horrifying, and utterly inexcusable debacle this was. Particularly amazing is the clip of the CNN reporter (see below) having to admit the error for the first time, as he awkwardly struggles to pretend that it\u2019s not the massive, horrific debacle that it so obviously is:\n\nKnowingly soliciting or receiving anything of value from a foreign national for campaign purposes violates the Federal Election Campaign Act. If it's worth over $2,000 then penalties include fines & IMPRISONMENT. @DonaldJTrumpJr may be in bigly trouble. #FridayFeeling https://t.co/dRz6Ph17Er \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) December 8, 2017\n\nCNN is leading the way in bashing BuzzFeed but it's worth remembering CNN had a humiliation at least as big & bad: when they yelled that Trump Jr. had advanced access to the WL archive (!): all based on a wrong date.
