    "content": "Last week the Democrats were touting the special election in North Carolina \u2019 s 9th District as the first major contest of the 2020 cycle , and the polls indicated that Democrat Dan McCready might win what should be a pretty safe GOP seat . By Wednesday morning , after Republican Dan Bishop had won , their focus had shifted and much commentary was devoted to his \u201c thin margin of victory. \u201d Little notice was taken of certain voting patterns that should frighten the Democrats . Specifically , McCready did far worse than expected in every county but one , and many of those counties are dominated by minority voters .\nThe most unnerving example , from the Democratic perspective , is rural Robeson County . The ethnic makeup of this county is as follows : Native American ( 38.6 % ) , White ( 25.7 % ) , Black ( 24 % ) , Hispanic ( 8.52 % ) , Two or More Races ( 2.15 % ) , Asian ( 0.66 % ) , Other ( 0.275 % ) . On Tuesday the Democrat received a fraction of the votes he received in 2018 , running for the same seat . Ryan Matsumoto of Inside Elections provides the gory details : \u201c McCready won Robeson County by only 1.11 points , a MASSIVE decrease from his 15.31 point margin last November. \u201d In 2012 , Obama carried Robeson by 17 points .\nThis is a county of about 143,000 , and 74 percent of these folks are clearly not the racist rednecks the Democrats would have us believe make up most of the Trump/GOP base . The shift away from McCready was the result of disenchantment among minority voters with the Democrat . Moreover , though Robeson was the most obvious , it was by no means the only ethnically diverse county whose voters \u201c walked away. \u201d Nearly 60 percent of Cumberland County \u2019 s approximately 333,000 residents are Black , Hispanic , or a member of some other minority group . McCready won it in 2018 . Dan Bishop won Cumberland on Tuesday .\nMuch the same scenario was played out in every county except the affluent white areas of Mecklenburg County , the only place where the Democrat improved on his 2018 performance . Bishop only flipped two new counties from blue to red , but he turned several from dark blue to pale blue , reducing McCready \u2019 s margins in enough ethnically diverse rural counties to win . So , what \u2019 s going on here ? The answer will be obvious to all but the willfully blind . Despite consistent attempts by the Democrats to frighten minorities with evidence-free claims that the economy is faltering , no one is buying that tale .\nA Harvard-Harris poll released in early September asked the question , \u201c How strong do you think the U.S. economy is today ? \u201d A majority of Blacks ( 53 % ) answered , \u201c Strong. \u201d In answer to the same question , a majority of Hispanics ( 54 % ) gave the same answer . These are far higher marks than any GOP president has received , particularly from Blacks . It isn \u2019 t necessary to consult the Delphic Oracle to discover why they are responding in this fashion . Black unemployment hit 5.5 percent in August , the lowest rate on record .

In other words , the decline in employment inequality now is undeniably the best on record because it comes in the context of falling unemployment .\nPresident Trump took pains to point this out at his North Carolina rally on Monday , explaining that he needs the help of people like Dan Bishop to keep the economy strong and to continue creating jobs for all Americans . He also called out \u201c the other Dan \u201d for supporting Nancy Pelosi on higher taxes , sanctuary cities , and radical abortion policies . More to the point , he said , \u201c On jobs , and taxes , and importers , Dan McCready is wrong and Dan Bishop is right. \u201d He went on to say , \u201c Here in North Carolina over 230,000 more people have jobs , and small business formation has skyrocketed by more than 25 percent. \u201d Later , Bishop said ,\nLet \u2019 s all say a prayer for [ the President ] because that \u2019 s what we do .

As this great fighter faces all those odds \u2014 the push by the Democrats and the Fake media \u2014 the last thing he needs is for the 9th District to send another nasty politician . President Trump needs nobody else in Washington who supports sanctuary cities and counties here in North Carolina or anywhere else .
