    "content": "By now you certainly know that the Democrats have been suffering from a self-inflicted injury since their convention began in Charlotte on Tuesday . For the first time in many presidential election years , the word God was omitted from their platform . The platform also failed to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . Both of these breaks from Democrat Party tradition were reportedly ordered by Obama .\nThen \u2026 another self-inflicted injury . According to reports , Obama ordered that God and Jerusalem be put back into the platform . That should be easy enough \u2026 just introduce an amendment and have the convention delegates approve it by voice vote . Easy enough \u2026 right ?\nAccording to the rules of the convention , -- - the RULES , mind you -- - under which the convention is to be run , a 2/3 majority of ayes over nays would be required to adopt this amendment . Now you have to feel a bit sorry for Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa here . Poor guy . He was actually giving the impression ( or it was a pretty good act ) that the rules meant something and that it was really going to take a 2/3 majority to approve the amendment . When the vote was taken the first time it was clear that the 2/3 majority did not exist . So \u2026 he asked for the vote again . The second time the nays seemed to be even more powerful . Uh oh . What is the chair going to do here ? Durned if it doesn \u2019 t sound like the delegates to this convention are not in favor of putting God and Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital back in the Democrat platform . Here ... you can watch the clip and determine for yourself which side actually \u201c won , \u201d not that it really mattered all that much . Obama was running this show \u2026 and Obama had preordained the outcome . The delegates were there for show \u2026 Obama is the REAL law of this convention \u2026 so it was time for Villaraigosa \u2019 s handler to step in .\nWatch the clip again \u2026 watch that lady walk on to the convention stage . She leans over and says something into Villaraigosa \u2019 s ear . Did you catch it ? Here \u2019 s what she said :\nAnd then you got ta let them do what they \u2019 re gon na do . \u201d\nDoes that remind you of anyone ? How about Obama \u2019 s principal advisor and confidant Valarie Jarrett . Remember what she said when she was heading up Obama \u2019 s transition team ? You should \u2013 her utterance really set the stage for Obama \u2019 s first four years in office : \u201c We will be ready to RULE from day one. \u201d Not we will be ready to \u201c lead , \u201d \u2026 . Ready to \u201c rule . \u201d\nOn the first day of the convention we heard a lot about how Obama single-handedly \u201c saved the American auto industry. \u201d No .. he didn \u2019 t . Obama saved the United Auto Workers union , not the auto industry ; and he did so by RULING that bankruptcy laws did not apply because HE had a better plan . That \u2019 s the type of America Obama wants to bring to us \u2026 an America where politicians rule and the people follow and obey -- - the people \u201c do what they \u2019 re gon na do . \u201d\nAll they needed on that stage yesterday was Nancy Pelosi telling the delegates that \u201c you got ta amend this platform before you can see what \u2019 s in it .
