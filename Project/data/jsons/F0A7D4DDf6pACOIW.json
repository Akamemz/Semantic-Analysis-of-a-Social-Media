This is something the president has broad authority to do ( President George W. Bush suspended refugee admissions for three months after 9/11 ) but that would severely disrupt the lives of thousands of refugees in the midst of a global refugee crisis . The executive order might make an exception for \u201c religious minorities \u201d who are persecuted in their home countries \u2014 presumably intended for Christians in the Middle East .\nSuspending visas from seven majority-Muslim countries : Trump is also expected to sign an executive order stopping people from several countries from entering the US on visas .
