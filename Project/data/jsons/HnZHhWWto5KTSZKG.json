And Florida is one of eleven states that effectively disqualify felons permanently .\nMeade is one of 1.6 million disenfranchised Florida felons \u2014 more people than voted in 22 states in 2016 .

There is a cumbersome , protracted process whereby an individual , after waiting five to seven years ( it depends on the felony ) can begin a trek that can consume ten years and culminates with politicians and their appointees deciding who can vote .\nMeade heads the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition , which gathered more than a million signatures to get the state Supreme Court to approve , and local supervisors of elections to verify , the ballot initiative that voters will decide on Nov. 6 .
