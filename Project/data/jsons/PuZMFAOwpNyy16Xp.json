Despite increased calls for social distancing as the United States grapples with a rapidly increasing avalanche of confirmed cases of Coronavirus -- with many more to come -- numerous anecdotal reports indicated that many nightlife hotspots were packed with people partying and drinking , as if nothing were happening . I was taken aback :\nHonestly blown away by the number of people I follow posting Instagram stories of themselves out at crowded bars and restaurants with ironic tags about social distancing or quarantines . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) March 15 , 2020\nLet 's consider the unfolding debacle in Italy as an urgent cautionary tale , relayed by an Italian journalist :\nUntil last week , the Italian public health care system had the capacity to care for everyone . Our country has universal health care , so patients aren \u2019 t turned away from hospitals here . But in a matter of days , the system was being felled by a virus that I , and many other Italians , had failed to take seriously ... So here \u2019 s my warning for the United States : It didn \u2019 t have to come to this . We of course couldn \u2019 t stop the emergence of a previously unknown and deadly virus . But we could have mitigated the situation we are now in , in which people who could have been saved are dying . I , and too many others , could have taken a simple yet morally loaded action : We could have stayed home . What has happened in Italy shows that less-than-urgent appeals to the public by the government to slightly change habits regarding social interactions aren \u2019 t enough when the terrible outcomes they are designed to prevent are not yet apparent ; when they become evident , it \u2019 s generally too late to act .\nI and many other Italians just didn \u2019 t see the need to change our routines for a threat we could not see . Italy has now been in lockdown since March 9 ; it took weeks after the virus first appeared here to realize that severe measures were absolutely necessary . According to several data scientists , Italy is about 10 days ahead of Spain , Germany , and France in the epidemic progression , and 13 to 16 days ahead of the United Kingdom and the United States . That means those countries have the opportunity to take measures that today may look excessive and disproportionate , yet from the future , where I am now , are perfectly rational in order to avoid a health care system collapse .\nHere 's Newt Gingrich issuing similar warnings from Rome . it 's going to get significantly worse here in the coming days . Indeed , a major contributing factor to Italy 's lethal mess was the population 's cavalier attitude in the earliest days of the crisis :\n\u201c They cited irresponsible behavior by many citizens , who despite the earlier warnings not to gather in large numbers , headed to beaches or ski resorts , and hung out together in town squares , especially after the closure of schools. \u201d https : //t.co/crTv8hmwCZ \u2014 Yashar Ali ? ? ( @ yashar ) March 15 , 2020\nThe opposite was true in other places , like South Korea , where the response was serious , coordinated , and effective . Relative progress is undeniable , and lives have been saved . Compare and contrast :\nSouth Koreans listened to their government 's warnings & ramped up testing rapidly .

Their divergent experiences hold urgent lessons for the U.S. and other democracies where the pandemic is at an earlier stage . Seoul , accepting the illness had arrived , kept its borders open and aggressively tracked down the infected using data and extensive tests . Rome , after escalating attempts to reduce travel and social interactions , quarantined the whole country , while only screening people once they had shown symptoms . The countries have two of the biggest coronavirus outbreaks outside China . But South Korea \u2019 s known infections are now stabilizing at around 8,000 , whereas Italy \u2019 s are rising relentlessly past 17,000 . South Korea has 67 deaths as of Friday . Italy \u2019 s death toll was a far higher 1,266 by late Friday , because the virus has hit its large and vulnerable elderly population and overwhelmed hospitals in some areas .\nA few points : By far , the most vulnerable populations are the elderly and people with underlying health conditions . Even if younger people do n't believe they 're likely to interact with these populations , the virus is so contagious that passing it along by breathing on shared surfaces , especially in public places , can be a risk . Visualize the spread of the disease here ( seriously , watch and share ) , and read this story about how one single person refusing to comply with guidelines ended up infecting approximately 1,000 other people . Many young , healthy people who contract Coronavirus are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms . But they can easily yet unwittingly spread the disease to peers or others , who could then in turn pass it along to expanding circles of people . This is profoundly serious :\nHere \u2019 s something that \u2019 s absolutely terrifying : a comparison of the age distributions of Covid-19 cases in Italy , where they are only testing people who show symptoms , and S.
