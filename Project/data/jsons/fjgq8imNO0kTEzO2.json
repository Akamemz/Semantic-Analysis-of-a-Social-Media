But before they even get to officially take over the Senate early next year, they're already fighting with each other over what to do in the next month.\n\nThe fight's ostensibly over whether to pass a spending bill in December that funds the government through October of next year, or only for a few months.

But a group of Senate conservatives, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), don't want to fund the government for any longer than they have to right now, so they can use funding as a weapon against any executive relief program early next year.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhat Mitch McConnell wants: A smoothly running government\n\nOn November 5, during his first press conference after his party took the Senate, McConnell made a promise on behalf of the new GOP Congress: \"Let me make it clear, there will be no government shutdowns and no default on the national debt.\"\n\nIn order for him to keep that promise, the GOP is going to need to stop risking government shutdown by playing chicken with bills to continue funding the government. That's going to be a lot easier if this upcoming funding deal lasts through next October, as opposed to just a few months. A short-term funding deal means that Congress would have to go through the whole funding rigamarole again early next year \u2014 with another chance for the government to shut down if it fails. And McConnell very much wants to avoid that:\n\nMcConnell has signaled to GOP colleagues that he wants to start his reign as majority leader in 2015 with a clean slate.

To the contrary, he's warned Obama that it would be like \"waving a red flag in front of a bull\" \u2014 though it's not clear whether McConnell meant it would enrage all Republicans, or whether he meant that McConnell wouldn't be able to control Cruz and company. But he would rather pass a longer-term bill now, see what Obama does on executive action afterwards, and try to stop it in 2015 without interfering with the typical budgetary process.\n\nWhat Ted Cruz wants: A commitment to fighting \"amnesty\"\n\nIt's generally assumed, by both Democrats and Republicans, that Obama is going to act on immigration before the end of the year \u2014 but that he's going to wait until after December 11th. The White House wants to stay out of Congress' way while it passes a funding fix, and then make its move on immigration.\n\nThis is frustrating to Senate conservatives who want to stop executive action that would protect unauthorized immigrants from deportation.\n\nThere are at least six senators who are in this camp: in addition to Sen.
