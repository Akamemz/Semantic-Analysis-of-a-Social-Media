    "content": "Last Friday , President Trump caused consternation among Democrats and their media allies by introducing an eminently sensible blueprint for reducing drug prices . The 50-point \u201c American Patients First \u201d plan addresses four broad challenges : High list prices for drugs , government programs overpaying for drugs , rising out-of-pocket costs for consumers , and foreign governments free-riding off American innovation . The blueprint relies on free market competition and private-sector negotiation rather than regulatory coercion and price controls . And , assuming his plan works as designed , President Trump will have succeeded where his predecessor proved utterly impotent . Consequently , the plan drew immediate criticism from the left .\nThe most common liberal complaint about the President \u2019 s blueprint involves his decision , as the New York Times laments , \u201c not to have the federal government directly negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare. \u201d Trump alarmed conservatives during his presidential campaign by flirting with that exceptionally bad policy idea , but sensibly abandoned it when working with his advisors to formulate a concrete plan . The term \u201c negotiate \u201d has no real meaning in the context of federal dealings with the drug industry . It is nothing more than a pseudonym for price controls . Allowing the government to \u201c negotiate \u201d with drug companies for lower Medicare drug prices would inevitably create shortages of badly needed pharmaceuticals .\nThat drug shortages would result from allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies is not a matter of speculation . We already have a huge federal bureaucracy that \u201c negotiates \u201d prices with drug companies \u2014 the Veterans Health Administration . And the results have been all too predictable . According to a study by Avalere , the VHA covers 16 percent fewer drugs than does Medicare Part D. Many of the medications not covered by the VHA are common generics . Not coincidentally , generic drugs figure prominently in Trump \u2019 s drug plan , which would increase industry competition by accelerating the speed with which such medications reach the market . On Friday , FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb put it as follows :\nWe \u2019 re helping remove barriers to generic drug development and market entry in an effort to spur competition that results in lower drug prices.\u2026 We \u2019 ve committed to timelier generic drug reviews to reduce the cycles of review that generic applications typically undergo .

How is this different from allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies ? The Part D prescription drug benefit is administered through private insurance plans ( sponsors ) that compete for business based on costs and coverage . They negotiate prices individually with drug companies . This system has worked better than any other federal entitlement at controlling costs .
