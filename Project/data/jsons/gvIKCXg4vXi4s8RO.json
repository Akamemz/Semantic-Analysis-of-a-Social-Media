    "content": "Many people are insisting we all sit down and have a thoughtful , calm reflection on the Second Amendment after the Connecticut massacre . Others , particularly on the Left , are more forthright and are demanding more gun control . If we are to engage in the former , however , I want to share some of the arguments Rep. Louie Gohmert made today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace .\nThe segment with Gohmert began with footage of Eric Holder saying we need to discuss who we are as a nation , talk about the freedom and rights we have , and how they can be used in a responsible way . In other words , he wants to talk about gun control . Rep. Gohmert \u2019 s response , which brought up Fast and Furious , was priceless :\n\u201c Well I think coming from him that \u2019 s really important to note coming from a man who \u2019 s in a department that forced the sale of guns to people that would bring about the death of people like Brian Terry and there should be national outrage about Mexicans , our neighbors , 200 or more that have been killed by the guns his department have forced to be sold , so he \u2019 s right . And Sen. Durbin is right but the conversation we \u2019 ve got to have has got to have everybody open-minded . I mean , we all react emotionally that \u2019 s why we \u2019 ve all shed tears\u2026 \u201d\nWallace then brought up the Aurora movie theater massacre and Gohmert making the argument in its aftermath for more people to carry weapons to prevent a similar situation from happening . Wallace asks : \u201c Do we really want folks in movie theaters , and shopping malls , and schools , armed ?\nGohmert responds : \u201c Once we have this actually open dialogue about the situation you find out\u2026every mass killing of more than three people in recent history has been in a place where guns were prohibited , except for one . They choose this place . They know no one will be armed . You know , having been a judge , having reviewed photographs of these horrific scenes and knowing that children have these defensive wounds , gun shots through their arms and hands as they try to protect themselves and hearing the heroic stories of the principal lunging trying to protect\u2026Chris , I wish to God she had had an M4 in her office locked up so when she heard gun fire she pulls it out and she didn \u2019 t have to lunge heroically with nothing in her hands , but she takes him out , takes his head off before he could kill those precious kids . \u201d\nThen the obligatory question by the media : Why do people need semi-automatic weapons ? Wallace says these are weapons created for law enforcement , for the military , but why does the average person need these \u201c weapons of mass destruction \u201d ?\nGohmert : Well , for the reason that George Washington said : A free people should be an armed people . It ensures against the tyranny of the government if they know that the biggest army is the American people , then you don \u2019 t have the tyranny that came from King George . That \u2019 s why it was put in there . Once you start drawing the line , where do you stop ? And that \u2019 s why it is important to not just look emotionally \u2013 emotionally our reaction is to immediately say lets get rid of all guns\u2026you do it as a judge . You react emotionally but you use your head and you look at the facts and the facts are that every time guns have been allowed , concealed carry have been allowed , the crime rate has gone down . Washington , DC ought to be the safest place in American and it \u2019 s not\u2026 \u201d",
