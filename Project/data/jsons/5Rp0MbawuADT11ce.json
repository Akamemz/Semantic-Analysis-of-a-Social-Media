    "content": "Michael Weiss is a columnist for Foreign Policy and NOW Lebanon . He reported from the 2012 siege of Aleppo .\nIt \u2019 s hard to pinpoint just when , exactly , Barack Obama \u2019 s Syria policy fell apart . Was it in December , when Islamists humiliated U.S.-backed rebels by seizing what limited supplies America had given them ? Was it back in September , when Obama telegraphed his reluctance to enforce his own \u201c red line \u201d after the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its own people ? Was it in the months beforehand , when the administration quietly and mysteriously failed to make good on its pledge to directly arm the rebels ? Or did it collapse in August 2011 , when Obama called on Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to go , only to do almost nothing to make it happen ?\nBut collapse it has , and more than 130,000 deaths later , the White House is now pinning its hopes on a peace conference in Switzerland later this month that is being billed as the last , best hope for a negotiated solution to a conflict that has displaced a staggering 40 percent of Syria \u2019 s total population , some 23 million people , in what the United Nations says is fast becoming the worst and most expensive humanitarian catastrophe in modern history .\nThirty countries , the United Nations , the European Union and the Arab League are all sending representatives to the Jan. 22 conference , where they are expecting to broker a peace accord between Syria \u2019 s two warring sides . As it now stands , however , the meeting , known as Geneva II , is already a fiasco . None of Washington \u2019 s affiliated rebels has any significance on the ground in Syria any longer , and the rebels who do matter on the battlefield want absolutely nothing to do with the conference ; they will not talk with Assad or his state sponsors Russia and Iran , the arms dealers and militia builders who are after all underwriting Assad \u2019 s war machine . In the months since Obama \u2019 s decision to cancel military retribution for the regime \u2019 s Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in Damascus , we have witnessed the near-total collapse of the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) , and with it the last shred of U.S. influence on the trajectory of the conflict .\nThe president \u2019 s indecision played a major role in the FSA \u2019 s eclipse . First , Obama deferred the decision on whether to wage punitive airstrikes to Congress . Then he sent high-ranking officials to Capitol Hill to sell this unloved policy of military intervention in a halfhearted and nothing-to-see-here manner , downplaying the effect that the mooted \u201c unbelievably small \u201d airstrikes , as Secretary of State John Kerry termed them , would have on the regime \u2019 s war-making ability . Finally , with the votes not forthcoming , the president scrapped the idea altogether in favor of an 11th-hour plan offered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to decommission Assad \u2019 s chemical stockpiles . From there , what remained of the FSA quickly disintegrated .\nBut the seeds were sown months earlier . About a week after Kerry gave two rousing war speeches and compared Assad to Adolf Hitler , and just days after Obama announced that he \u2019 d be seeking congressional authorization for airstrikes , the Wall Street Journal reported what every Syrian already knew : The light arms that the White House had licensed the CIA to deliver the FSA \u2019 s coordinating body , the Supreme Military Council ( SMC ) , way back in June\u2014when earlier evidence of the regime \u2019 s repeated use of chemical weapons had become internationally known\u2014had yet to arrive , owing to the difficulty of securing delivery \u201c pipelines . \u201d\nThe Journal account suggested what now seems clear : The administration didn \u2019 t want the rebels to actually win ( this was \u201c somebody else \u2019 s civil war , \u201d as Obama would later phrase it ) or for any direct U.S. intervention to fundamentally alter the balance of power on the ground . It only wanted to run arms to persuade the FSA to buy into its negotiating strategy . \u201c When we have more skin in the game , \u201d one unnamed senior administration official told the Journal , \u201c it just puts us in a position to have deeper relationships with the opposition but also work more effectively with other countries who are doing a lot in terms of support. \u201d Instead , the White House took all its skin out of the game ; and those other countries , chiefly Saudi Arabia , turned ferociously against the United States , with potentially dangerous consequences to come .\nKEY PLAYERS Gen. Salim Idris A 55-year-old defector , Idris is now chief of staff of the Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) , the most Western-friendly grouping of Syrian rebels . Prior to the war , Idris had been dean of a military engineering academy in Aleppo , and other rebel leaders have scoffed at his battlefield acumen . The United States has equipped the FSA with non-lethal supplies , but has been leery of providing weapons directly , and the FSA has lost considerable support in recent months as Islamist groups have gained ground . Zahran Alloush A hard-line Salafist and former prisoner who heads the Islamic Front , an umbrella group of Islamist Syrian rebel brigades estimated to be able to muster as many as 60,000 fighters , Alloush is close to Saudi Arabia , the Islamic Front \u2019 s chief patron . He has positioned himself between al Qaeda and the FSA , but some analysts question just how distinct his views are from al Qaeda \u2019 s . Prince Bandar bin Sultan al-Saud The head of Saudi Arabia \u2019 s intelligence agency , Bandar is a familiar figure in Washington , where he was ambassador from 1983-2005 and played a key behind-the-scenes role in the Afghan jihad . In recent months , the 64-year-old Bandar , who spearheads Saudi Arabia \u2019 s Syrian strategy , has grown increasingly critical of U.S. policies in Syria . U.S. officials have fired back , with Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly describing the freelancing Bandar as \u201c the problem. \u201d Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Little is known about the shadowy commander of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , the more extreme of two al Qaeda offshoots fighting in the Syrian civil war . Baghdadi , an Iraqi , was the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq before it expanded to become ISIS . The U.S. State Department has branded the 42-year-old Baghdadi , also known as Ibrahim Ali Al-Badri Al-Samarrai , a \u201c specially designated global terrorist. \u201d According to some estimates , he commands more than 5,000 foreign fighters .\nSo while historians can debate the exact expiration date on Obama \u2019 s Syria policy for posterity , the last four months should be remembered for what they were : a series of crisis points , botched responses and missed opportunities . This is the story of what happened inside Syria after Obama changed his mind and made Assad and Putin his peace partners , while the world looked away .\nIt did not take long for al Qaeda to smell an opportunity .\nAyman al-Zawahiri , the group \u2019 s successor to Osama bin Laden , was the first to sense most keenly Obama \u2019 s wobbliness on Syria and the deleterious impact that a deferred U.S. attack on Assad would have on FSA morale and credibility . In his address on the 12th anniversary of 9/11 , Zawahiri denounced the FSA for the first time as \u201c enemies of Islam \u201d and agents of a U.S.-backed program for fomenting a Sunni \u201c awakening , \u201d or sahwa , which he defined as a hearts-and-minds strategy designed to isolate and defeat al Qaeda , just as tribal leaders and coalition forces had done half a decade ago in Iraq .\nBut in Syria , there are now two al Qaeda affiliates or offshoots . The strongest is the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham ( ISIS ) , by far the more brutal and uncompromising of the two . The man in charge of ISIS is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , an Iraqi who claims to be a direct descendant from the Prophet Mohamed and is clearly running one of the most expansive and successful jihadist campaigns in the Middle East . Baghdadi sent operatives into Syria in the summer of 2011 who created Jabhat al-Nusra , which began carrying out suicide bombings throughout the country and was blacklisted by the United States in late 2012 . However , Nusra split with ISIS last year owing to tensions between Baghdadi and Nusra \u2019 s own leader , Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani . ( Zawahiri sided with Jawlani and tried in vain to rein in Baghdadi , now relocated from Iraq to Syria . ) In the last several months , ISIS has emerged as the more powerful faction , having absorbed a great deal of Nusra \u2019 s fighters . According to an intelligence briefing prepared by the SMC , the \u201c most dangerous and most important \u201d section of the organization \u201c consists of approximately 5,500 foreign fighters . \u201d\nIt was ISIS that went to war with the FSA . A day after Zawahiri \u2019 s communiqu\u00e9 , on Sept. 12 , it launched a campaign known evocatively as \u201c Expunging Filth \u201d and aimed at the U.S.-backed al-Farouq and al-Nasr brigades in northern Syria . ISIS had already killed Kamal Hamami , an SMC commander , in July after a dispute at one of the group \u2019 s checkpoints in Latakia , but now it took to executing another SMC rebel on charges of trying to precipitate sahwa . But the starkest expression of this internecine warfare came about a week later , on Sept. 18 , when ISIS violently raided the northern town of Azaz , which lies strategically south of a main border crossing between Syria and Turkey through which \u201c non-lethal \u201d Western aid had been delivered to SMC groups .\nOne of these groups , the Northern Storm Brigade , which hosted Sen. John McCain in Syria last May , was expelled from Azaz by the jihadists . Panicked and outmatched , Northern Storm called on Liwa al-Tawhid , a nominally SMC-aligned Islamist \u201c super-brigade \u201d in Aleppo , to come to its rescue . Tawhid is , or was , a pragmatic Islamist militia known for being open to greater Western support , if only such had ever been forthcoming , and also one of the largest rebel formations in Syria , with an estimated 12,000 fighters . Tawhid heeded Northern Storm \u2019 s call for help and dispatched forces to Azaz to try to calm a chaotic situation . Meanwhile , an intense debate broke out among Tawhid \u2019 s commanders , as several rebels informed me at the time , about whether or not to use the Azaz takeover as an opportunity to declare all-out war on ISIS or to mediate the crisis through negotiations .\nIn the end , the border crossing was returned to the FSA , but Azaz wasn \u2019 t . And the damage was done . After this incident , and following further ISIS gains throughout northern and eastern Syria , more and more FSA-aligned fighters , sometimes even whole brigades , began defecting to the al Qaeda franchise . Areas where the FSA had once had strong presences , such as Binnish , Dana and al-Bab \u2014 a town I visited in late July 2012 under FSA escort , days after it had been liberated from regime control \u2014 now fell to ISIS .\nBy this time , too , many rebels were coming to the realization that by allowing foreign extremists into Syria in the absence of Western intervention , they had inadvertently laid the groundwork for a totalitarian counterpart to the regime , one that tolerates no dissent and has kidnapped journalists , activists and a popular Jesuit priest , and staged public beheadings of its enemies . When I interviewed FSA fighters , including Islamists , in southern Turkey in mid-September , their common refrain was that they now faced two mortal enemies . \u201c Bashar al-Assad is beautiful compared to the Islamic State , \u201d one rebel aligned with the SMC told me at the time .",
