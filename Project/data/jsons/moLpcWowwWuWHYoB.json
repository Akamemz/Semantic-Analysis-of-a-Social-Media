    "content": "Well , yesterday \u2019 s impeachment hearing before the House Judiciary Committee went as expected with regards to the hyperbole . House Democrats want President Trump out . They \u2019 re not using a shoddy quid pro quo allegation from a July phone call with Ukraine as their basis . Trump supposedly tried to shakedown the Ukrainians into opening a corruption probe into Hunter Biden or risk having military aid withheld . Ukraine got aid . Ukraine got lethal aid . Ukraine got the aid that Obama refused to give because it might upset Putin , but Trump is the one who \u2019 s soft on Russia . The mind spins . Remember this was the party who thought Russia wasn \u2019 t a threat , as demonstrated by their mocking of Mitt Romney in 2012 . The Left \u2019 s inability to grasp history bit them\u2014and the Russophobic rabies that followed has been nothing short of epic .\nSo , here we have three supposed constitutional law experts , who are really just anti-Trump clowns , giving their testimony on how this whole nothingburger allegation is really just as serious as the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby . In fact , this may be the crime of the century , even more , serious that when O.J . Simpson allegedly quasi-decapitated his ex-wife in 1994 . I mean this isn \u2019 t Watergate . This isn \u2019 t even impeachable . There was no quid pro quo . There was no bribery . It \u2019 s just Democrats and their allies being totally and utterly insane . Take one of their law experts yesterday , Noah Feldman , who looks like actor Benedict Cumberbatch , who said that if we don \u2019 t impeach Trump , then we \u2019 re no longer living in a democracy . Yeah , this is the type of silliness that \u2019 s going to cost Democrats the 2020 election . No one believes that for a second . Also , we \u2019 re not a democracy ; we have a republic . And as Ed noted , we have term-limits and elections . Again , Democrats have no grasp of history , which is why it \u2019 s always amusing when they have their so-called constitutional experts try and lecture us about our nation \u2019 s history , which deep down they hate . It \u2019 s almost always wrong , and here you have Exhibit A .\nConstitutional scholar Noah Feldman : `` If we can not impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage , we no longer live in a democracy\u2014we live in a monarchy , or we live under a dictatorship .

There was already a slim chance , and by slim I mean virtually non-existent , that the GOP Senate would convict Trump over having a phone conversation with the Ukrainians , but now it \u2019 s definitely not going to happen . So , great work , Democrats . You \u2019 re not going to move the needle on impeachment , swing-state voters are opposed to your antics , they like Trump on the economy , they \u2019 re going to vote for him again , and you didn \u2019 t move the needle in terms of more American supporting your quasi-coup . Everyone sees this for the partisan clown show that it is\u2014and they \u2019 re bot going to reward you for this .",
