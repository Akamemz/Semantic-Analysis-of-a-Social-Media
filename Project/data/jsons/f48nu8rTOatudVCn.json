    "content": "The White House has officially refused to co-operate with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump .\nA letter sent to Democratic leaders rejected it as `` baseless '' and `` constitutionally invalid '' .\nThe inquiry is trying to find out if the president held back aid to Ukraine to push it to investigate Joe Biden , who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination .\nThe White House letter comes hours after the Trump administration blocked the US ambassador to the European Union from appearing before a congressional impeachment investigation .\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone addressed the eight-page letter to the leading Democrat and House Speaker , Nancy Pelosi , and the three chairmen of the Democratic committees .\nHe accused the leaders of setting up an inquiry that `` violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process '' .\nThe letter insisted that , because Democrats did not hold a vote on launching impeachment proceedings in the House , the inquiry was `` constitutionally invalid '' .\nThe letter also accused Democrats of trying to change the 2016 election result , and `` deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen '' .\n`` In order to fulfil his duties to the American people ... President Trump and his Administration can not participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances . ''\nIn response , Ms Pelosi called the letter `` manifestly wrong '' and accused Mr Trump of trying to `` normalise lawlessness '' .\n`` Mr President , you are not above the law .

He said those communications had been passed to the Department of State , which was withholding them .\n`` The failure to produce this witness , '' the California Democrat added , `` the failure to produce these documents , we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress .
