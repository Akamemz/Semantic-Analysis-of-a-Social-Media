Left-wing Democrats call centrist members of their own caucus racist for voting their conscience . Freshman Democrats accuse the Speaker of the House of racism for requesting that they behave with decorum .

A textbook example of the assistance they offer to \u201c the party of Jefferson and Jackson \u201d can be found in a recent New Republic column titled \u201c Trump and His Deplorables. \u201d Its author , Matt Ford , begins by praising Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 observation that \u201c you could put half of Trump \u2019 s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. \u201d He then goes on to tell his readers that Clinton \u2019 s cavalier condemnation of 30 million voters was a highly nuanced argument whose wisdom has long since been vindicated :\nTwo years into Trump \u2019 s presidency , \u201c deplorable \u201d seems almost kind .
