    "content": "Joel Benenson is a world-class worrier , but he isn \u2019 t especially worried about Donald Trump in the fall .\nTrump isn \u2019 t freaking out just Republicans these days : Democrats , panicked by the Manhattan mogul \u2019 s seemingly unstoppable rise in the primaries , see him as an ocher ogre capable of undoing President Barack Obama \u2019 s legacy and undermining the civility supporting American democracy .\nTrump-phobia has infected many people in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s extended orbit \u2014 especially her notoriously jelly-kneed donors \u2014 and they are dutifully fretting over Trump \u2019 s dark-alley debate style , his promise to napalm the Clintons with personal attacks and , above all , his magical-realism appeal to angry Rust Belt whites .\nBenenson , the Clinton campaign \u2019 s bearded principal pollster and chief strategist , can \u2019 t even bring himself to pay lip service to Trump , whom he sees as a one-man Democratic turnout machine and a turn-off switch to moderates in both parties . His analysis of the 2016 landscape leads him to the conclusion that Trump has virtually no path to the presidency ( he won \u2019 t say the same thing about Bernie Sanders ) and presents Clinton with renewed opportunities in purple states \u2014 especially North Carolina and Arizona .\nIndeed , when I interviewed him for \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s \u201c Off Message \u201d podcast on Friday , the usually easygoing Benenson was in a tense and testy mood , bracing for an uncertain battle against Sanders on Tuesday \u2014 lashing the Vermont senator for impugning Clinton \u2019 s character . But when I mentioned Trump \u2014 specifically the developer \u2019 s claim he could swipe New Hampshire , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio and the lot from the Democrats \u2014 his Charlie Brown cloud lifted instantly .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not real , \u201d a grinning Benenson said of Trump \u2019 s repeated claim he can defeat Clinton ( or Sanders ) by wrestling away swing-state voters .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t see any state that Democrats have won five out of six times , or six out of six times , that Trump , you know , at face value , poses a threat in . I just don \u2019 t see it , \u201d said Benenson , who was the top pollster in Obama \u2019 s two successful presidential campaigns .\n\u201c What \u2019 s the evidence of it ? The evidence of it , they \u2019 ve turned out a lot of people . I think he \u2019 s broken 50 percent in only one state , right ? \u2026 If you look at the states that Democrats have won \u2026 in five out of the last six [ presidential contests ] , it adds up to 257 electoral votes . It means you only need 13 more to get to 270 , if we perform that way . \u201d\nOther Obama alumni \u2014 including 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe \u2014 are basically on the same page , although they think Trump \u2019 s unpredictability ( coupled with Clinton \u2019 s innate caution as a candidate ) could cause unexpected problems . Benenson said he hasn \u2019 t polled extensively on Trump yet , but he thinks Trump has so antagonized minority voters \u2014 and turned off moderate whites with his harsh rhetoric and chaotic rallies \u2014 that Clinton might exceed Obama \u2019 s 2012 total of 332 Electoral College votes .\nNorth Carolina , which Obama won narrowly in \u2019 08 and lost by 2 percentage points four years later , would likely be target No . 1 in a Clinton-Trump showdown . \u201c That \u2019 s going to be a very problematic state for Republicans , \u201d he said . \u201c Now , we played there in 2012 , but not a lot . The president didn \u2019 t go into the state . We let Romney outspend us 5-to-1 . \u201d\nIt would be nice to have the luxury of focusing exclusively on Trump ( or , better still , concocting a game plan against Ted Cruz , the Clinton camp \u2019 s preferred opponent ) . But there \u2019 s the small matter of clearing aside Sanders , who has a front-runner \u2019 s online fundraising operation and a terrier-with-teeth-in-your-leg competitive tenacity that could keep him in the fight until the convention .\nA couple of weeks ago , Clinton \u2019 s team was very confident she was close to wrapping up the nomination . But when I asked Benenson to look ahead to Tuesday \u2019 s big five-state contest , he hit the basic talking points : She was ahead by 215 pledged delegates , a bigger lead in that category than Obama ever enjoyed in \u2019 08 . And he demurred when I asked whether Clinton would emerge with a \u201c substantial \u201d net delegate gain for the night . \u201c Substantial ? \u201d he said . \u201c There are a lot of delegates . Like I said , if there are 867 out there \u2014 I don \u2019 t know how we \u2019 ll be measuring substantial by the end of the night , and I can \u2019 t forecast it , because some of these states are closer than others . \u201d\nLike everybody else , Benenson was a bit blindsided by Sanders \u2019 stunning win in Michigan last week ( Brooklyn \u2019 s data team predicted a 5-point Clinton win ; public pollsters had Sanders losing by three or four times that margin ) . Moreover , it \u2019 s no secret that he has struggled ( along with the candidate herself ) to sharpen Clinton \u2019 s sprawling competence-and-policy-mastery platform into a compact , inspirational , bumper-sticker message to compete with Sanders \u2019 anti-Wall Street crusade . Reports of friction between him and the Clintons have been overstated , he told me .\n\u201c You know , she \u2019 s been on the road more , and I \u2019 m here more in New York and Brooklyn , \u201d said Benenson , the highest-ranking member of Clinton \u2019 s team who hadn \u2019 t worked with her on previous campaigns . \u201c But I think we \u2019 ve gotten to know each other more . We talk very frankly . She knows I speak my mind ; I \u2019 m somebody who does , and I think that works for her . \u2026 I like it when we \u2019 re doing debate prep and there \u2019 s a lot of back-and-forth , and you \u2019 re hearing her talk . She \u2019 s often the one who comes up with the best things because they come from what she \u2019 s believed for a long time , and I think it \u2019 s a pretty powerful place to be . I think this is a woman who knows who she is , knows why she \u2019 s doing this . \u201d\nBenenson is protective of Clinton and has , not surprisingly , cultivated a not-inconsiderable disdain for Sanders and his sharp-elbowed team . \u201c He \u2019 s been in the free media , been leveling very \u2014 and the whole campaign has been leveling very explicit attacks on Secretary Clinton . He \u2019 s tried to impugn her character , \u201d he said , his voice rising to a near shout . \u201c He does it all the time . He does it , you know , in a way that has given him enough wiggle room to say , \u2018 No , no , I \u2019 m not being negative , \u2019 but of course he is . His whole campaign . \u201d\nSanders \u2019 criticisms of Benenson \u2019 s former boss , Obama , are especially galling . Walk into the pollster \u2019 s 33rd-floor office in midtown Manhattan and you \u2019 ll find a minimuseum full of first-rate \u2019 08 ephemera : The conference room is festooned with \u201c Obama Wins \u201d newspaper headlines , and a cardboard cutout of the 44th president stares back at you benevolently as you sit on the waiting room couch .\n\u201c The things he says about Barack Obama . \u2026 It actually pisses me off \u2026 because it \u2019 s disingenuous , \u201d Benenson said , flashing real anger . \u201c Don \u2019 t stand on a stage in front of television cameras , with millions of people when you \u2019 re running in a Democratic primary , and say he \u2019 s a friend of yours and you work with him . \u201d\n\u201c You know , I \u2019 d like to remind everybody what he said when Barack Obama was under attack by Republicans running for reelection in 2012 , when he called [ Obama ] weak , a disappointment to millions of people , and said he didn \u2019 t have the backbone to stand up to Republicans , \u201d he said , suggesting Sanders is more comfortable slamming his allies than the common enemy . \u201c I haven \u2019 t heard him say a word about George Bush . Have you even heard him mention George Bush \u2019 s name on the campaign trail ? \u201d\nThe contempt , in many ways , is born of familiarity . Benenson , like Sanders , is an overachieving outer-borough working-class Jew who was drawn to progressive political causes early in life . Both had peripatetic young adulthoods that didn \u2019 t portend powerful futures on the national stage . Sanders college-hopped , abandoning his native Brooklyn for bucolic Vermont , where he earned a living as a carpenter , writer , filmmaker and freelance gadfly before winning the Burlington mayor \u2019 s race as a socialist .\nBenenson , who looks a decade younger than his 63 years , took an even more circuitous path . He dropped out of Queens College , just short of graduation , to work in avant-garde theater . Then , to pay his rent , he accepted an uncle \u2019 s offer to help run a beer distributorship in Crown Heights in Brooklyn . And that \u2019 s where he spent the night of the 1977 New York City blackout \u2014 staked out at the front door , a shotgun borrowed from his girlfriend \u2019 s brother loaded on his lap . Then he wanted to become a Yankees beat reporter , which eventually led to a successful career as a political scribe for the New York Daily News . He is a rarity in the media-suspicious world of the Clintons : Many of his oldest friends are reporters \u2014 Adam Nagourney of the Times , Roger Simon of \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Serge Kovaleski ( the Timesman whose disability Trump mocked at a rally ) and Obama message man David Axelrod , who made his name at the Chicago Tribune .\nLike Sanders , who was arrested for participating in a civil rights demonstration as a student in 1960s Chicago , Benenson had his own brush with protest and the police . In 1970 , a day after the Kent State shootings , a 17-year-old Benenson was ( in his words ) \u201c detained \u201d after joining a group of anti-Vietnam War protesters who blocked the heavily trafficked Long Island Expressway .\nBut their paths diverged in ways that say much about the character of each man and of each campaign . While Sanders spent most of his teens and 20s as an activist for socialist and student organizations , Benenson was attracted to mainstream Democratic politics . His hero was Bobby Kennedy , and he casts the New York senator \u2019 s 1968 campaign as the hybrid of idealism and pragmatism currently embodied by his 2016 boss .\nIn our interview , Benenson started to talk about Kennedy matter of factly , but he broke down as he described watching TV coverage of Martin Luther King \u2019 s assassination in his mother \u2019 s Laurelton living room . He remembers the image of Kennedy , jumping on top of a parked car to address a seething African-American crowd in Indianapolis . \u201c What we need in the United States is not division , \u201d Kennedy said . \u201c What we need in the United States is not hatred ; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness , but love and wisdom , and compassion toward one another . \u201d",
