    "content": "A British neo-Nazi Satanist group should be outlawed by the government as a terrorist organisation , according to a report from anti-racism campaigners .\nHope Not Hate has used its annual State of Hate report to call for the Order of Nine Angles ( ONA ) to be banned .\nThe Home Office said the list of proscribed terrorist groups was kept `` under review . ''\nLast week two British extreme right-wing organisations were added their number .\nOne of them - Sonnenkrieg Division - was influenced by the ONA 's Nazi-Satanist ideology , a supernatural worldview that encourages the disruption of society through violence , criminality and sexual offending .\nIn the past year four teenagers linked to the ideology have been jailed in the UK for terror offences , with one of them convicted of preparing for a terror attack by - among other things - trying to alter himself in line with instructions set out in ONA texts .\nIn court , prosecutors described the organisation as `` self-consciously , explicitly malevolent '' and the `` most prominent and recognisable link between Satanism and the extreme right . ''\nHope not Hate 's report says the occult organisation - thought to have been founded in the 1970s - has become increasingly prominent online , noting that its `` terminology and trappings have taken on lives of their own , adopted into the lexicon of the wider terroristic far-right . ''\nThe anti-racist campaign group , which investigates violent extremism , argues that the group 's `` sick ideas have drawn in young extremists in the UK and elsewhere , and have helped nourish a dangerous culture of unprecedented depravity amongst the extreme right , which has none of the moral constraints that previous generations of far-right activists had . ''\nYvette Cooper MP , chair of the home affairs select committee , said the home secretary `` should immediately '' refer the ONA to the government 's proscription review group .\n`` The combination of Nazi-Satanism , extreme violence and sexual abuse makes it particularly troubling and action needs to be taken to prevent them grooming and radicalising other people , '' she said .\nA Home Office spokesperson said action was being taken to `` root out and dismantle the groups that promote extreme right-wing views and we are giving police the tools and resources they need to tackle this threat . ''\nThe spokesperson added : `` We keep the list of proscribed organisations under review . ''\nCounter-terrorism police have previously spoken about the increasing amount of work relating to `` niche ideologies '' such as violent Satanism .",
