    "content": "Except among a tiny minority of far-left Americans , political correctness ( P.C . ) is deeply unpopular . Some 80 percent of people said they viewed P.C . excess as a problem .\nThat 's according to a fascinating survey conducted by More in Common , an international research initiative . The researchers asked respondents dozens of questions about race , immigration , sexism , free speech , and other hot button issues , and then sorted them into seven different categories : progressive activists , traditional liberals , passive liberals , the apathetic , moderates , traditional conservatives , and devoted conservatives . The two conservative categories constituted 25 percent of the total ; the progressives , just 8 percent .\nEveryone else , according to the researchers , form an `` exhausted majority '' whose views are not so different from one another , even across racial and gender lines .\n`` Most members of the 'exhausted majority , ' and then some , dislike political correctness , '' wrote The Atlantic 's Yascha Mounk in a terrific write-up of the survey . `` Among the general population , a full 80 percent believe that 'political correctness is a problem in our country .

''\n`` Youth is n't a good proxy for support of political correctness\u2014and it turns out race is n't , either , '' Mounk observes .\nThe best proxies are education level and income : the most highly educated Americans are more likely to think hate speech is a big problem , but political correctness is not .\nI 've written several articles for \u2588\u2588\u2588 about political correctness and the extent to which a backlash against it may have helped Donald Trump win the presidency .
