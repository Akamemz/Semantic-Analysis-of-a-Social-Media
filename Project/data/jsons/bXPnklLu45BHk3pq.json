    "content": "A dishy new book purports to reveal the inner secrets of the Trump White House \u2014 and has already provoked President Donald Trump to a furious response .\nThe book in question is Fire and Fury : Inside the Trump White House , by longtime media writer Michael Wolff . Though just released this morning , it \u2019 s already been dominating the political news cycle for a few days . New York magazine published a lengthy excerpt from it Wednesday , the Hollywood Reporter ran a column by Wolff on the book Thursday , and the Guardian , the Washington Post , and CNBC have all run quotes from it .\nFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon , meanwhile , has come under fire from the Trump family for quotes he seems to have given to Wolff . And the Washington Post \u2019 s Carol Leonnig writes this morning that Trump \u2019 s lawyers have sent a cease-and-desist letter to the book \u2019 s publisher , demanding to stop its publication .\nThe excerpts from the book released earlier this week tell a mostly familiar big-picture story of chaos during the presidential transition and in Trump \u2019 s early months in the White House . Wolff spruces things up , though , with new quotes , anecdotes , and purported personal details \u2014 many of which are eye-popping and unflattering .\nIndeed , some of the things Wolff describes in the excerpts sound so outlandish \u2014 and also happen to be so hazily sourced \u2014 that there \u2019 s already a vigorous discussion in the political world about how , exactly , this book should be interpreted . As fact ? As \u201c trashy tabloid fiction , \u201d as the White House argues ? Or as something in between ?\nFrom what I \u2019 ve read so far , my view is that we should interpret the book as a compendium of gossip Wolff heard . A fair amount of it does clearly seem to be accurate . Wolff did get access to the White House \u2014 reporters have seen him coming and going there this year . He seems to have been in the room for some of the events he depicts . Bannon evidently talked to Wolff a great deal , and he hasn \u2019 t disputed any of the controversial quotes attributed to him that have already earned him a presidential tongue lashing .\nBut of course gossip is often wrong or inaccurate . Sources can misstate the facts accidentally , or deliberately . ( A source for one of Wolff \u2019 s anecdotes , Sam Nunberg , has previously admitted to spreading made-up Trump campaign gossip . ) And we don \u2019 t really know how much effort Wolff put into trying to nail down whether the juicy stuff we heard was actually true . Some anecdotes and details in the book don \u2019 t seem to match known facts ; others seem outright impossible to verify . Some people are disputing quotes attributed to them . And Wolff is often deliberately vague about his sourcing .\nIn other words , the book does seem to be a collection of stuff Wolff heard . How much of that stuff is actually true is a different question \u2014 one that \u2019 s much tougher to answer .\nWolff is a well-connected New York columnist who \u2019 s covered the media industry for decades . He \u2019 s written columns for outlets like New York magazine , Vanity Fair , and the Hollywood Reporter and has several books under his belt ( including two about wealthy media moguls ) .\nHe \u2019 s also long been a controversial figure . For instance , in a 2004 article for the New Republic , journalist Michelle Cottle took stock of Wolff \u2019 s work . After describing his \u201c quick wit , dizzying writing style , and willingness to say absolutely anything about anybody \u201d in \u201c a catty , caustic way , \u201d and his fixation \u201c on culture , style , buzz , and money , money , money , \u201d Cottle essentially argues that Wolff is more of a gossip compiler than a rigorous reporter :\nMuch to the annoyance of Wolff 's critics , the scenes in his columns are n't recreated so much as created \u2014 springing from Wolff 's imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events . Even Wolff acknowledges that conventional reporting is n't his bag . Rather , he absorbs the atmosphere and gossip swirling around him at cocktail parties , on the street , and especially during those long lunches at Michael 's . `` He 's around town enough to have those insights , to spot people , to come across [ pieces of information ] , '' says a friend . ... On a meta level , Wolff is resented for not playing by the rules of his chosen profession . He has a reputation for busting embargoes and burning sources by putting off-the-record comments on the record .\nWolff \u2019 s prominence in the New York media world likely means he was on Trump \u2019 s radar for some time . And Trump \u2019 s team gave him access last year \u2014 Wolff got news-making interviews with Trump himself late in the primary season ( in which Trump struggled to answer a question about Brexit ) , and with Bannon during the transition ( in which the incoming White House chief strategist bragged that \u201c darkness is good \u201d and laid out a plan to build \u201c an entirely new political movement \u201d ) .\nSo it \u2019 s not entirely surprising that Wolff would land a great deal of access to the new White House in 2017 \u2014 indeed , he claims to have landed \u201c something like a semi-permanent seat on a couch in the West Wing \u201d with Trump \u2019 s \u201c non-disapproval , \u201d and to have conducted more than 200 interviews .\nFrom the excerpts released so far , the big-picture takeaways appear to be that the White House is a chaotic mess , that many people working there hate each other and also disdain Trump , and that Trump can be both ridiculous and mean . But some more specific tidbits that have drawn attention are :\nBannon opined to Wolff that Donald Trump Jr. \u2019 s meeting with a Russian lawyer in search of dirt on Hillary Clinton was \u201c treasonous , \u201d speculated the elder Trump may have been involved in the meeting as well , and asserted that Jared Kushner was involved in some \u201c greasy \u201d business that could expose him to money laundering charges . ( Trump already responded to this with a furious official White House statement denouncing Bannon . )\nKatie Walsh , a deputy chief of staff who lasted only about two months in Trump \u2019 s White House , is quoted saying that working with Trump was \u201c like trying to figure out what a child wants. \u201d ( Some reporters say she \u2019 s disputing the quote . )\nOne excerpt claims to describe Trump \u2019 s methodology for getting \u201c friends \u2019 wives into bed , \u201d which he purportedly likes to say is \u201c one of the things that made life worth living. \u201d ( The process involves a speakerphone . )\nWolff makes some allusions to Trump \u2019 s mental state : \u201c Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions . It used to be inside of 30 minutes he \u2019 d repeat , word-for-word and expression-for-expression , the same three stories \u2014 now it was within 10 minutes. \u201d ( \u201c At Mar-a-Lago , just before the new year , a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognize a succession of old friends , \u201d he adds in his Hollywood Reporter column . )\nAnother claims that Trump has \u201c a longtime fear of being poisoned , \u201d which supposedly explains his love of McDonald \u2019 s .\nWolff writes that Mark Corallo , who served as a spokesperson for Trump \u2019 s legal team before resigning this summer , privately confided that he thought an Air Force One meeting in which Trump \u2019 s team strategized about how to respond to the news that Don Jr. had met a Russian lawyer \u201c represented a likely obstruction of justice . \u201d\nAccording to another tidbit , when former Fox News chief Roger Ailes suggested John Boehner as a potential chief of staff for Trump during the transition , Trump responded , \u201c Who \u2019 s that ? \u201d\nWolff claims that Ivanka Trump made fun of her father \u2019 s hair , and has said to Kushner that she wants to be the first woman president . He also claims that Melania Trump was in tears , \u201c and not of joy , \u201d on election night when learning Trump would win .\nOverall , the book \u2019 s most eyebrow-raising claims appear to reside on a spectrum ranging at least from \u201c true \u201d to \u201c highly dubious gossip . \u201d\nWhat appears to be the biggest news in the book so far \u2014 Bannon \u2019 s provocative speculation about the Trump family and the Russia investigation \u2014 does appear to be , at least , accurate quotation of him . Bannon isn \u2019 t disputing any of the quotes , and Breitbart News , the website he runs , straightforwardly wrote them up on Wednesday . Whether Bannon \u2019 s claims have any validity , though , isn \u2019 t clear .\nAdditionally , for at least some of the events Wolff describes , he appears to have been in the room . For instance , Wolff spends a good chunk of the New York magazine excerpt describing , in detail , a dinner Bannon and Ailes shared in January . Some reporters questioned how Wolff could have written such a vivid scene , and the passage didn \u2019 t make his sourcing clear . But per Axios \u2019 s Mike Allen , Wolff was in the room , and in fact hosted the dinner .\nOther tidbits are more problematic . For instance , the suggestion that Trump didn \u2019 t know who John Boehner was in 2016 appears highly dubious . Trump has tweeted about Boehner 26 times ( once even mocking his occasional habit of crying ) and played golf with him . It seems likely that someone told this juicy anecdote to Wolff \u2014 perhaps Ailes , whom Wolff has covered for years , who was the other party to the conversation , and who died in May . But it \u2019 s not clear whether Wolff bothered to check if it made sense , if Trump may have momentarily misheard Ailes \u2019 s remark , or whether something else may have been going on .\nSome sourcing is also troublesome . Wolff quotes former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg purportedly describing an attempt to explain the Constitution to Trump . \u201c I got as far as the Fourth Amendment before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head , \u201d Nunberg is quoted as saying . But just a few months ago , Nunberg bragged to a reporter that he made up what he said was a false story about Chris Christie getting Trump McDonald \u2019 s during the campaign .\nOther sourcing , such as for the Jared and Ivanka anecdotes , is hazy . Did Wolff rigorously fact-check what he heard here , or might it have been a bit too good to check ? Katie Walsh , meanwhile , says she \u2019 s disputing some quotes attributed to her \u2014 but whether this is a case of factual inaccuracy on Wolff \u2019 s part or the phenomenon known as \u201c source remorse \u201d ( when someone regrets saying too much to a reporter and seeks to disavow it ) isn \u2019 t clear . ( Axios \u2019 s Allen writes this morning that Wolff taped many of his interviews , including at least one with Walsh , which could certainly bolster his case . )\nThe bigger-picture issue here is that the excerpts released so far suggest Wolff used a writing style common to major reported political books \u2014 the dramatic reconstruction of scenes and sometimes dialogue in a you-are-there style , with his specific sourcing for many claims omitted .\nThat makes for a more entertaining read , but it provides less transparency in the sourcing of specific claims and therefore makes it more difficult to get any sense of just how solid Wolff \u2019 s information may be . Which scenes was he in the room for ? If he was in the room , did he record audio and nail exact quotes , or use some combination of notes , memory , and dramatic license ? What did he hear from sources with firsthand knowledge ? What did he hear from people with secondhand knowledge ?\nIn the end , here \u2019 s New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman \u2019 s assessment of the book :\nThin but readable . Well written . Several things that are true and several that are not . Light in fact-checking and copy-editing . \u2014 Maggie Haberman ( @ maggieNYT ) January 3 , 2018\nOverall , my advice for reading the book is to look closely at what Wolff reveals about the sourcing of each of his claims .\nThe most reliable stuff is , well , stuff people said on the record to Wolff directly . If the quotations directly quote people telling him things and identify them , they are probably accurate . ( That doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean what these sources are saying is accurate , but the quotes themselves are probably right . ) Again , Bannon really does seem to have said all that stuff .\nSimilarly , look for clues about which scenes Wolff was actually in the room for \u2014 even though , in the passages released so far , his opaque descriptions of his sourcing can make that rather difficult .\nAs the sourcing grows hazier , you should probably add grains of salt accordingly . Of course , anonymity is often crucial for sources to speak candidly . But it also can allow people to spread untrue or inaccurate information . And given Wolff \u2019 s weakness for gossip and the questions raised about some of his juicy tidbits so far , a skeptical eye seems warranted .",
