    "content": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton received monthly missives about the growing unrest in Libya from a longtime friend who was previously barred by the White House from working for her as a government employee , according to emails received on her personal account .\nThe messages show the role played by Sidney Blumenthal , who was working for the Clinton family foundation and advising a group of entrepreneurs trying to win business from the Libyan transitional government . Mr. Blumenthal repeatedly wrote dispatches about the events in Libya to Mrs. Clinton , who often forwarded them to her aides at the State Department .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s earlier efforts to hire Mr. Blumenthal , who has spent nearly two decades working for the Clinton family , as a State Department employee were rejected by Obama administration officials who said they feared his role spreading harsh attacks against Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential primaries would cause discomfort among members of their new White House team .\nMrs. Clinton is the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president , which has heightened the scrutiny of her use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state .\nMr. Blumenthal \u2019 s continued role was revealed in nearly 350 pages of emails , published Thursday by The New York Times , about the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi , Libya , that killed four Americans , including U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens .\nLast year , Mrs. Clinton gave the State Department 55,000 pages of emails that she said pertained to her work as secretary sent from the personal address she used while at the agency .

They are expected to be released by the State Department in the coming days after months of delay .\nThe panel , which was initially formed to investigate Stevens \u2018 death , has become a vehicle to question Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s tenure at the State Department . This week , the panel subpoenaed Mr. Blumenthal to testify on Capitol Hill .\nThere is nothing in this batch of emails to suggest that Mrs. Clinton was actively soliciting Mr. Blumenthal \u2019 s advice or alleged intelligence information , although the documents contain few replies she may have sent to him . Her responses are polite , in one case thanking him for \u201c useful \u201d information .\nMuch of the contents deal with infighting that still plagues Libya , as weak political leaders failed to disarm powerful revolutionary militias and different armed commanders battled among themselves for the nation \u2019 s spoils .\nThe evening after the Benghazi attack , Mr. Blumenthal forwarded to Mrs. Clinton an analysis of the situation from former CIA official Tyler Drumheller , which purported to contain information from \u201c sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council as well as the highest levels of European governments as well as Western intelligence and security services . \u201d\nThe memo said a top Libyan official , Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf , had told close associates that the Benghazi attack was carried out by the militant group Ansar al-Shariah and that Libyan security officials believed the group \u201c took advantage of cover provided by \u201d demonstrations against the Internet video seen as insulting to the Prophet Muhammad to conduct it .\nThe memo , citing an unidentified source passing on information from unnamed Libyan security officials , said that 21 members of Ansar al-Shariah had joined with about 2,000 demonstrators outside the Benghazi facility . Citing the same source , the memo said that some Libyan officials believed the protest was organized solely as cover for the attack .\nThe unidentified source cited by Mr. Drumheller said some Libyan security officials had told Mr. el-Magariaf that the group had been planning the attack for about a month .\nMrs. Clinton forwarded Mr. Blumenthal \u2019 s email to her deputy chief of staff , Jake Sullivan , with the instruction , \u201c We should get around [ to ] this asap , \u201d to which Mr. Sullivan replied , \u201c Will do. \u201d Mrs. Clinton also forwarded the email to another person , whose identity is redacted , with the instruction \u201c pls print . \u201d\nOther emails to Mrs. Clinton from Mr. Blumenthal in the aftermath of the attack offer additional material from similar unnamed sources describing Egyptian and Libyan governments \u2019 concerns about the situation and growing sectarian violence .
