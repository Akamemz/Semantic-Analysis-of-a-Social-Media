And what will it say ?\nHollingsworth v. Perry concerns the California ballot initiative , enacted in 2008 . In a brief filed with the court on Thursday , opponents of Prop 8 made broad arguments claiming that it is unconstitutional .\n`` Proposition 8 is an arbitrary , irrational and discriminatory measure that denies gay men and lesbians their fundamental right to marry in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses , '' the opponents said .\nThe brief was written by Theodore B. Olson and David Boies , who represent the American Foundation for Equal Rights .\nThey wrote , `` Because of their sexual orientation -- a characteristic with which they were born and which they can not change -- plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians in California and across the country are being excluded from one of life 's most precious relationships .\n`` They may not marry the person they love , the person with whom they wish to partner in building a family and with whom they wish to share their future and their most intimate and private dreams , '' they added .\nThe arguments tackled more than just the ruling that struck down Prop 8 on narrow grounds specific to California 's history on the issue of gay marriage .\nThe language was sweeping : `` The only substantive question in this case is whether the state is entitled to exclude gay men and lesbians from the institution of marriage and deprive their relationships -- their love -- of the respect , and dignity and social acceptance , that heterosexual marriages enjoy .\n`` This badge of inferiority , separateness and inequality must be extinguished .

Verrilli Jr. is not required to file a so-called `` friend of the court '' brief in the Prop 8 case , but sources said the administration is considering the possibility at the highest levels . If it chooses to weigh in , it has to do so by the last week of February .\nIn San Francisco Wednesday , President Obama told \u2588\u2588\u2588 station KGO-TV , `` The solicitor general is still looking at this . I have to make sure I 'm not interjecting myself too much into this process , particularly when we 're not party to the case . I can tell you , though , that obviously my personal view is that I think that same-sex couples should have the same rights and be treated like everybody else . ''\nAt the White House briefing on Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney said , `` I think you have seen no expression from the president on the constitutional or legal aspects of this .
