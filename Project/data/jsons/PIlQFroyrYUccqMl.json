    "content": "President Donald Trump has banked his North Korea policy on selling Kim Jong Un a future of prosperity and riches . But legislation Trump signed bars companies from investing in the country because of its abysmal record on human rights , an issue the president has given scant attention in talks with Pyongyang .\nHeading into his second meeting with the North Korean leader , the president is planning to pitch him on a vision of North Korean modernization , White House officials have said . Trump dangled the prospect of material wealth for Kim \u2019 s impoverished homeland on Monday , telling reporters , \u201c I think he \u2019 ll have a country that will set a lot of records for speed in terms of an economy . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not clear how the president is proposing to help Kim realize his economic goals . A provision Trump signed into law as a part of a 2017 sanctions bill cracking down on Iran , Russia and North Korea could prove a crippling obstacle to any American overture , experts said . The law prohibits imports of anything produced or manufactured by a North Korean citizen \u2014 and it would fall on Congress , not the president , to repeal the measure .\n\u201c Because of U.S. law today , the general counsel of any U.S. company is not going to recommend going into North Korea because of human rights abuses , \u201d said Victor Cha , who served as President George W. Bush \u2019 s top adviser on North Korea . The Trump administration , he said , \u201c needs to talk about human rights if they \u2019 re going to achieve what they want to achieve . \u201d\nThat means Trump could ink a nuclear deal with North Korea that lifts some sanctions in exchange for Kim \u2019 s promise to give up his nation \u2019 s nuclear weapons , but he would have to rely on Congress to repeal the 2017 law in order for any American company to significantly invest in North Korea . That \u2019 s unlikely , barring a deal that addresses human rights in a substantive manner .\nSince their first meeting Singapore last year , the president has worked to entice Kim to give up his nuclear arsenal by pitching dreams of beachfront condominiums and gold-plated casinos . During their inaugural meeting , Trump played a four-minute video for his counterpart \u2014 produced by the CIA and based on a psychological profile of the North Korean leader , according to a source familiar with its production . The video urged Kim to abandon his pursuit of nuclear weapons in order to \u201c enjoy prosperity like he has never seen . \u201d\nThis approach carried with it a sharp turn away from the brutal nature of the North Korean regime \u2014 something to which Trump had , in fact , called attention during the first year and a half of his presidency . Among the first lady \u2019 s guests at the 2018 State of the Union address were the parents of Otto Warmbier , the American student imprisoned by North Korea who was returned in a vegetative state early in the Trump presidency , and North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho . Trump decried the \u201c depraved character \u201d of the regime and said \u201c no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea . \u201d\nThere was no rhetoric like that during his discursive 90-minute news conference at the end of his meeting with Kim last June . Pressed on whether , and to what extent , he had challenged Kim on human rights , Trump told reporters , \u201c It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization , \u201d adding : \u201c They will be doing things . I think he wants to do things . \u201d\n\u201c After he met with Kim , never talked about it , \u201d Cha said .\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment .\nFaced with mounting pressure to incorporate human rights into its North Korea policy , the Trump administration has in recent months provided little information to lawmakers on Capitol Hill , limiting the extent to which it has provided classified briefings on the matter , according to two senior Republican congressional aides . Though lawmakers have pressed administration officials on the issue , \u201c they did not provide a lot of substance , \u201d one of the aides said . \u201c I can \u2019 t stress the extent to which , in recent months , things have really dried up . \u201d\nExperts insist that economic reform alone is not enough to effect change \u2014 it must be interrelated with national security and human rights , as the U.S. managed to do at the height of the Cold War . The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 cracked down on U.S. trade with the Soviet Union and its satellites in response to human rights abuses . The 1975 Helsinki Accords , signed by 35 countries , recognized Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe while extracting a commitment from the Soviet Union to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms .\n\u201c We lose a great opportunity if we don \u2019 t focus on human rights as part of our arsenal on North Korea , \u201d said Jay Lefkowitz , who served as special envoy for human rights in North Korea during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 a congressionally mandated post for which the Trump administration has yet to nominate anyone . \u201c The irony is , of all the things he \u2019 s done in his presidency , the thing that looked the most promising was his North Korea policy during the first 18 months , where he kept both North Korea and China really off balance .
