After House Republicans changed the rules to ensure that the disability side of the program (SSDI) will run out of cash in late 2016, it was the Senate GOP's turn to bash the program in a Budget Committee hearing.\n\nThey say that Social Security is fundamentally flawed. We can't transfer money from the retirement side to the disability side, because that would be financially irresponsible. They frame this as \"robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" which is apparently the slogan of choice, since it was repeated by several GOP senators at the hearing. The SSDI fund will \"soon be broke,\" said committee Chair Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) \"I'm really tired of bailing out water,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\nThis is a bunch of nonsense. It is designed to obscure a pure ideological agenda of cutting benefits.

The retirement side of Social Security is fine until 2034, and topping up SSDI out of that money would only shave one year off that.
