But thanks to a coalition of Native American and climate activists , about 20 miles of one of them\u2014the the Dakota Access Pipeline\u2014will now be rerouted away from a Sioux Reservation , according to statements from President Obama .\nThat is clearly a partial victory for the anti-pipeline coalition\u2014but given the results of the election , it is perhaps a pyrrhic one .\nDAPL is a 1,100-mile long , $ 1.6 billion part of a massive $ 4.8 billion energy infrastructure project to bring oil from Canada and the Northwest to Chicago . It \u2019 s being built by Energy Transfer Partners , which has a spotty record of spills elsewhere , but which won all the necessary environmental approvals for this project .\nBut then Native American groups and climate change activists saw an opportunity . As shown on this incredibly excellent ( anti-DAPL-biased ) map , the approved route of the pipeline crosses the Missouri just half a mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation ( and , activists have noted , across parts of North Dakota that were supposed to have been granted to the Sioux under a 1851 treaty ) . Because that crossing point depends on an easement from the Army Corps of Engineers , activists saw an opening to protest the pipeline , raise the long-ignored issue of Native American rights , and make the cost of doing business in fossil fuels that much higher .\nThe result was an escalating series of protests arguing that a leak or rupture in the pipeline could spill into the Missouri , which provides drinking water for some of the Sioux , and that the pipeline crosses ancient burial grounds .\nFrom the outset , the motives of the activists were mixed . In fact , the Sioux themselves are divided on DAPL , many supporting it and many opposing it . Meanwhile , a lot of the organizational and communications muscle has been provided by climate activists , who oppose not just DAPL but any pipelines , anywhere .\nAt least in theory\u2014really , a more sophisticated understanding of the strategy is that it increases the marginal cost of fossil fuel infrastructure , thus making renewables a more attractive alternative . At present , oil , gas , and coal comprise 81 percent of American energy consumption . Renewables comprise 5 percent . The main reason is cost , and the enormity of the fossil fuel industry . So if litigation , regulation , protests , bad PR , security , and other assorted costs can drive up the cost of doing business in fossil fuels , then that calculus might gradually begin to shift .\nBut then something unexpected happened . In the midst of the election , DAPL became a cause cel\u00e9bre for the Bernie Left , a kind of alternative to an election with candidates they didn \u2019 t like and issues ( like climate change ) that weren \u2019 t being discussed . More than 1 million slacktivists \u201c checked in \u201d virtually at the protest site ( under a mistaken belief that law enforcement was using Facebook to track protesters ) , but thousands of more serious activists showed up and put their bodies on the line . Most intriguingly , Native groups that are often at loggerheads came together for the cause .\nViolence between police and protesters , and then the acquittal of the Bundy family , intensified the protests . Consider the outrage : white nationalists occupy federal land and get off scot free , whereas Native Americans defending their own land are hit with tear gas . There are plenty of differences between the two cases , but the juxtaposition was hard to ignore . At a time when most Americans were cheering the Cleveland Indians , DAPL was a powerful counterpoint .\nThe protests also became an alternative to an election in which no one is talking about the gravest existential threat to our world , i.e . global climate disruption , let alone the rights of Native Americans .\nNow , in reality , DAPL is hardly the most important crisis point for either Native or climate issues . Other pipelines\u2014for example , the Spectra Algonquin AIM natural gas pipeline that runs just 50 miles from New York City , and , at one point , beneath an aging nuclear power plant\u2014are more dangerous . The proposed Missouri River crossing point already has a natural gas pipeline and high voltage electric lines over it , and the the risk to drinking water was determined by government experts to be minimal . ( Compare the risk , the numbers , and the outrage to Flint , Michigan , for example . ) And DAPL is nothing compared with the economic woes of reservations , poor access to healthcare and basic services , and continued discrimination , marginalization , and assimilation of Native Americans .\nBut DAPL became a symbol\u2014an opportunity to focus attention on issues that are usually ignored . At least people were paying attention .\nDAPL will still be built , of course , so the climate contingency hasn \u2019 t really won . It will still cross the Missouri , too\u2014while we don \u2019 t know the new route , probably , if you look at the excellent map again , an alternate crossing point will be found , farther from Sioux Country but still downstream from Bismarck . That will lessen the water pollution concerns , but more importantly , move the crossing far from the reservation and the protesters .\nIs that a win ? Not necessarily , but it \u2019 s undeniable that the protests have galvanized progressives and united Native Americans . That may prove to be their most lasting contribution .\nEspecially , to state the obvious , in the Trump administration . Trump has already promised to greenlight the Keystone XL Pipeline , drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , and opening up public lands across the country to fossil fuel development . Compared with that , DAPL isn \u2019 t even a deck chair on the Titanic ; it \u2019 s a coaster on a side table next to one .\nAnd fossil fuels are only a tiny part of the story . The Trump administration will likely ban even the consideration of climate change in any governmental planning ( let alone regulation ) , as Florida has already done . The Paris Accords will be shredded on day one . So will support for renewable energy . It \u2019 s easy to get overly apocalyptic about the next four years , but in terms of climate change , the impact will indeed be catastrophic .\nIn fact , one might argue that the gestural , romantic politics of the pipeline protest , to the extent they diverted energy away from the election , ultimately contributed to a far , far worse situation for both the climate and for Native Americans . In a sense , the DAPL protests were a kind of political fantasy , a distraction . They were full of stereotyping of Wise Native Americans\u2014not among the hard core activists , of course , but certainly among the hundreds of thousands of more who were Standing with Standing Rock by sitting on their sofas . There were New Age prayer vigils for Standing Rock , just like the Evangelical prayer vigils for Trump . There was plenty of heated rhetoric : the protest site is \u201c Sacred Stone Camp , \u201d the pipeline is the \u201c Black Snake. \u201d And while Native Americans often took a leading role in the protests , one could also argue that their concerns were often being exploited for other activists \u2019 agendas .\nOn the other hand , one could just as easily blame Hillary Clinton for failing to inspire progressives , or even persuade them to trust her .
