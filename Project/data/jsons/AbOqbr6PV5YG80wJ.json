The international Brent benchmark had fallen from $ 69 at the start of the year to around $ 50 last week .\nThen came last week \u2019 s meeting between OPEC and non-member countries . On the agenda : a production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day , or about 1.5 % of global production . The idea was to keep prices from sagging even more as demand is expected to fall this year . Saudi Arabia , the world \u2019 s No . 2 oil producer , wanted No . 3 Russia and other nonmembers to take 500,000 barrels per day of the cuts . Since 2016 , the Saudis and the Russians have worked together on production issues .\nBut this time the Russians balked . They refused to join new cuts , or even to extend previous production cuts that were due to expire at the end of March . And the Saudis hit back , telling customers that they were going to ramp up production and slash prices for Asian customers .\nA : First , protecting market share . Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have seen U.S. producers take a chunk of their market , and falling prices help keep customers on board .\nSecond , Saudi Arabia may hope that the pain of low prices will force a Russian rethink . \u201c Saudi Arabia has de facto launched a price war against Russia , promising to sell its oil at a discount in order to maximize its oil revenues , \u201d say analysts at UniCredit bank . \u201c It appears Saudi Arabia wants to cement its position as the world \u2019 s top oil exporter and to persuade Moscow to return to the negotiating table . \u201d\nA : Russia may have seen no point in cutting production only to lose market share as U.S. shale producers in Texas and New Mexico take up the slack . Analysts say Saudi Arabia may be underestimating Russia \u2019 s ability to weather low prices . Both countries are heavily dependent on oil revenues for their state budgets . But Russia says it can balance its budget at around $ 42 a barrel for its own benchmark crude .
