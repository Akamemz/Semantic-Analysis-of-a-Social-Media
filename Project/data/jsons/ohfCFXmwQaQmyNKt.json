Dishonest fake readers ! ) ,\nI had to take a break from this \u201c news \u201d letter to listen to Donald Trump \u2019 s CPAC speech . Then , I had to feed the kid , who \u2019 s home sick . Then I had to . . . well , to make a long story short , I \u2019 m sitting in my car outside of Fox News in D.C. and I don \u2019 t have a lot of time left before the suits in New York start smashing my collection of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2013themed hummels like Eddie Murphy in 48 Hours when he breaks the glasses at the cowboy bar . Charlie Cooke likes to call me on Skype and pretend to accidentally nudge one off the shelf for every 15 minutes I \u2019 m late . ( \u201c Oh dear , look at poor Russell Kirk , how shall we ever put him back together again ? \u201d )\nSo , I \u2019 m going to start fresh here and see how far I can get before I have to go on air .\nWhen President Trump finally got around to talking about his agenda , I thought it was a very good \u2014 i.e. , effective \u2014 speech . I disagree with all of the demonization of free trade and I thought his disparagement of his predecessors was no less shabby than when Obama said similar things . Also , I could do with less of the \u201c blood of patriots \u201d talk \u2014 more on all that in a moment . But if he does all the other stuff he talked about , I would be very happy .\nAlso , Trump delivered a good performance and it \u2019 s not shocking the crowd ate it up . One of the things the mainstream media doesn \u2019 t seem to fully appreciate is that just because Trump isn \u2019 t having a honeymoon with the press , the Democrats , or a good chunk of independent voters , that doesn \u2019 t mean he \u2019 s not having a very real honeymoon with Republicans . They want him to succeed and they want his \u201c enemies \u201d not just to lose , but to be humiliated ( hence the popularity of Milo in some corners , and a chunk of my least friendly e-mail ) .\nIndeed , I think there \u2019 s good reason to believe that the honeymoon is more intense precisely because Trump is under such a sustained assault . Something similar happened under George W. Bush when the Left lost its collective mind and did everything it could to undermine a wartime president . Conservatives \u2014 me included \u2014 out of a sense of both loyalty and anger rallied to Bush and had a tendency to overlook certain foibles and mistakes for the greater good . We may not be at war \u2014 at least not like we were in , say , 2005 \u2014 but the Left and the media are clearly at war with Trump . And because Trump often makes it difficult for his allies to defend him on ideologically or politically consistent terms , the attachment is often more emotional than rational . Ann Coulter titling her new book \u201c In Trump We Trust \u201d or , as Kellyanne Conway put it on Thursday , saying that CPAC should really be called \u201c TPAC \u201d ( i.e. , Trump-PAC ) gets right to the heart of the situation . Politics on the right is increasingly about an emotional bond with the president .\nWhich brings me to Trump \u2019 s comments on the media and fake news . Trump said :\nRemember this \u2014 and in not \u2014 in all cases . I mean , I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man . It was a very fair story . There are some great reporters around . They \u2019 re talented , they \u2019 re honest as the day is long . They \u2019 re great . But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people . A tremendous disservice . They are very dishonest people .\nYou do see what he \u2019 s doing right ? The guy who once literally pretended to be his own publicist hates anonymous sources ? The guy who powered his way into politics by claiming \u201c very credible sources \u201d told him that Obama \u2019 s birth certificate was fake is upset by \u201c fake news \u201d ?\nAn 'extremely credible source ' has called my office and told me that @ BarackObama 's birth certificate is a fraud . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 6 , 2012\nI firmly believe that society should have some compassion for the transgendered . And that \u2019 s true whether you take transgenderism on its own terms or if you think it \u2019 s a disorder of some kind . Cuomo is right that people should err on the side of tolerance .\nBut you know who else we should have tolerance for ? Twelve-year-old girls who don \u2019 t want to see male junk in the girls \u2019 locker room . We should also have tolerance for parents who do not like the idea of their daughters going into bathrooms with cross-dressers or any other grown man who insists that he has a right to use the little girls \u2019 room . And there are , by my rough calculation , 1 million times more people who fall into these latter categories .\nHard cases make for bad law . Life deals a lot of hard cases to people .
