And except for a one-time repatriation tax , the U.S. will no longer tax most profits made by businesses overseas .\nBoth changes should boost economic growth and American workers ' wages . Moreover , the reform removes many of the distortions that discourage companies from investing foreign-earned income in the United States and prompt them to use tax avoidance techniques .\nSecond , this was a very good year for deregulation . Cutting taxes is n't the only way to boost growth and raise wages ; innovation may matter even more . Getting rid of duplicative and outdated regulatory hurdles to innovation promises to have a real impact on our lives . That 's what the Trump administration , with the help of Congress , seems committed to doing .\nWhen the president first got to the White House , for example , he froze many not-yet-implemented Obama-era regulations . These include the punishing overtime pay regulation , which would have increased the cost of employing workers and ultimately reduced their base compensation to offset the increase in overtime pay .\nTrump also issued an executive order requiring that for every new regulation issued , `` at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination , and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process . '' That should put the brakes on the regulatory frenzy of the past few years . Congress also used the Congressional Review Act to eliminate another 14 costly regulations , a tool that had been used only once before .\nAt the agency level , Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is doing his share to boost innovation and investment through deregulation . The FDA is working on lowering the cost of development to bring a new drug to market\u2014 $ 2.6 billion on average , according to one Tufts University study\u2014by streamlining and lightening the approval process without jeopardizing safety .\nMeanwhile , the Federal Communications Commission , led by Chairman Ajit Pai , eliminated misleading `` net neutrality '' rules .
