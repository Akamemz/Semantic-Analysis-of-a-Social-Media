''\nThe victim 's mother , Allison Jean , said Guyger 's sentence would give the fired officer 10 years to reflect and `` change her life . '' The native St. Lucian also called for change and a renewed focus on police training in the city where her son died .\n`` There is much more to be done by the city of Dallas , '' she said , addressing a crowd gathered around her on the seventh floor of the courthouse . `` The corruption that we saw during this process must stop . ''\nProsecutors had asked for no less than 28 years , a reminder that Jean would have celebrated his 28th birthday this week if not for Guyger .\nShe faced between five and 99 years or life in prison , and the jury considered but rejected a `` sudden passion '' defense that could have reduced her punishment to two to 20 years . Guyger will be eligible for parole after five years .\nGuyger , 31 , was off-duty but still in uniform the night she killed Jean at the South Side Flats apartments just blocks from police headquarters . She said she mistook his apartment for hers and thought he was a burglar .\nAfter a day of testimony focused on how long Guyger would spend in prison , Jean 's 18-year-old brother said in his victim-impact statement that he wished she did n't have to serve any time at all .\nInstead , he said , he wanted for Guyger what his older brother would have wanted .\n`` I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that Botham would want for you , '' he told her . `` I love you as a person , and I do n't wish anything bad on you .
