''\n`` Please delete those tweets , '' Klausutis wrote . `` My wife deserves better . ''\nLori Klausutis died suddenly after hitting her head on a desk after losing consciousness from an abnormal heart rhythm . There were no signs of foul play , and her death was ruled an accident .\nTrump continued to baselessly accuse Scarborough on Twitter Tuesday morning , stating that the conspiracy theory `` was not a Donald Trump original thought . ''\nThe backdrop : Trump accused Scarborough without evidence of murdering Lori Klausutis in multiple tweets last week . He previously did the same in 2017 .\nThe president called on his followers to `` keep digging '' and to `` use forensic geniuses '' to find out more about the death , which occurred at Scarborough \u2019 s congressional office in Fort Walton Beach , Fla .\nScarborough was in Washington at the time of her death .\nThe MSNBC host and his wife , Mika Brzezinski , have both pushed back on Trump 's claims on air in recent days . Brzezinski called the president a `` cruel , sick , disgusting person '' for his tweets .\nWhat they 're saying : `` The President 's tweet that suggests that Lori was murdered without evidence ( and contrary to the official autopsy ) \u2014 is a violation of Twitter 's community rules and terms of service , '' Timothy Klausutis wrote .\n`` An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet but I am only asking that these tweets be removed .
