Ethiopia is the country 10th most vulnerable to climate change effects, according to a 2013 report by Maplecroft Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 9th most at risk: Philippines \u2013 Manila, capital of the Philippines, is one of the five cities, all in Asia and all projected to be centers of high economic growth, that face \"extreme risk\" from climate change impacts, according to the Maplecroft report. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 8th most at risk: Cambodia \u2013 Cambodia is among the Southeast and South Asian countries tipped to face an increased risk of severe flooding because of projected changes in seasonal rainfall. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 7th most at risk: DR Congo \u2013 A fisherman sits in a boat on the shore of Lake Kivu in Goma in August. \"There are no big fish because of the gas; we only catch small whitebait,\" one said of the carbon dioxide and methane that saturate the lake. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 6th most at risk: Nigeria \u2013 Floodwaters course through Odo Ona in Nigeria's Oyo State in 2011. At least 102 people were killed when a dam burst during torrential rain. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 5th most at risk: South Sudan \u2013 Tainted water pours into a containment pond in a Unity field processing facility in what is now South Sudan, where there are concerns about the environmental damage being caused by the oil industry. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 4th most at risk: Haiti \u2013 Residents of Jacmel, Haiti, make their way through floodwaters as Tropical Storm Isaac dumps heavy rains in August 2012. An extreme exposure to climate-related events, combined with poor health care access, weak infrastructure, high levels of poverty and an over-reliance on agriculture have led to the country being categorized as at \"extreme\" risk. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 3rd most at risk: Sierra Leone \u2013 Felled trees lie on the mountainside just outside Freetown. African countries account for 14 of the 20 most at-risk nations. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change 2nd most at risk: Guinea-Bissau \u2013 Residents walk past the Parliament in Bissau, capital of Guinea-Bissau. African countries rank as at high risk in the index, partly due to their natural susceptibility to events such as floods, droughts, fires, storms or landslides. But their high ranking is also a product of the vulnerability of the population and the inadequacies of existing infrastructure to adapt to or tackle climate change challenges because of weak economies, governance, education and health care. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: 10 countries vulnerable to climate change Most at risk: Bangladesh \u2013 Bangladeshis attempt to stay dry above flood waters in the capital, Dhaka. Bangladesh was ranked by Maplecroft the country most vulnerable to climate change, and Dhaka the world's most vulnerable city, due to its exposure to threats such as flooding, storm surge, cyclones and landslides, its susceptible population and weak institutional capacity to address the problem.
