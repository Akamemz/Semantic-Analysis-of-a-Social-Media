The basic issue , as David Wasserman breaks down for the Cook Political Report , is that for prognostication purposes you don \u2019 t only want to know who wins or loses a special election \u2014 you want to know the margin .\nMontana is considerably redder than the average congressional district . According to Wasserman \u2019 s calculations , in an election where Democrats got 50 percent of the two-party vote nationwide , you \u2019 d expect them to get just 39 percent in Montana . Quist scored 44 percent , and with the Libertarian pulling in 6 percent , his share of the two-party vote is more like 46 .\nThings aren \u2019 t as simple as saying that Rob Quist outperformed the 39 percent benchmark and therefore Democrats are on track to win \u2014 geography means Republicans can hold their majority with less than 50 percent of the vote . But the GOP underperformed badly in Montana , after a similar underperformance in the special election for Kansas \u2019 s Fourth Congressional District .\nThere are 120 Republican-held House seats that are more GOP-friendly than Montana \u2019 s at-large district . If Republicans are winning in places like Montana by just 7 percentage points , then they are in extreme peril of losing their House majority in November 2018 .\nRepublican leaders have taken their party on a risky course , and they ought to strongly consider turning the ship around .\nThe GOP \u2019 s House majority is safeguarded , first and foremost , by geography . Donald Trump lost the popular vote nationally by 2.1 percentage points but won the median House seat by 3.4 points . Or to look at it another way , despite garnering fewer votes than Clinton overall , Trump carried a plurality of the vote in 230 congressional seats against just 205 for Clinton .\nA somewhat pointless debate tends to play out among operatives and political handicappers over how much we should characterize this geographical skew as a question of \u201c gerrymandering \u201d versus the allegedly natural \u201c clustering \u201d of Democratic voters in big cities . The reality is that whatever you call it , the lines are drawn in such a way that Republicans could easily hold the majority even if millions more people vote for Democratic candidates .\nAnd that \u2019 s lucky for them . With Trump \u2019 s approval rating 15 points underwater , the policy agenda dominated by a deeply unpopular health care bill , and a steady drip of stories about Trump \u2019 s connections to Russia , the basic ingredients are in place for Republicans to take a drubbing .\nUnder the circumstances , the knowledge that geography has created safe redoubts that are significantly more Republican than the nation as a whole is what gives the GOP confidence that it can forge ahead with this path . To win by only 7 in Montana , a state that Trump won by 20 points , is a clear sign that seats Trump won by 4 or 5 points or more aren \u2019 t truly safe .\nThe precise dynamics of the Quist-Gianforte race obviously aren \u2019 t going to play out in other districts .
