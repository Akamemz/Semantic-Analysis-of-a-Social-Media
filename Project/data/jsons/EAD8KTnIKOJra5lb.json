After weeks of brutal feuding over the best way to attack Obama \u2019 s new health-insurance entitlement program , Republicans are rallying around a new strategy : Step back from the debt-limit fight and remain focused on the ongoing battle over funding the federal government . Conservative activists groups made it clear Wednesday that they were not interested in a debt breach . Despite some talk about \u201c sequencing \u201d obligations to avoid default , conservatives seem uninterested in fighting Obama on that bloody ground . That \u2019 s a good news and bad news for House Speaker John Boehner .\n[ Poll : Government is biggest problem facing country - According to a new Gallup poll , 33 percent of respondents say the nation \u2019 s most important problem is the government , politicians or Congress , a 16 percent spike from last month . ]\nLet \u2019 s talk - Boehner , House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and other members of House leadership head to the White House today . Obama had invited all 232 Republican members of the House , but Boehner decided to limit the delegation to his leadership team . The expected topic of conversation had been the proposal from Ryan and others to construct a large-scale , multi-year deal on debt , spending and taxes to address the immediate issues of fully funding the government and extend the debt limit . But with conservatives veering away from holding up the debt limit over ObamaCare , the situation is different . A larger deal is now less likely .\n[ Lew : no payments if debt ceiling reached - Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is expected to warn lawmakers today that \u201c he will be unable to guarantee payments to any group \u2014 whether Social Security recipients or U.S. bondholders \u2014 unless Congress approves an increase in the federal debt limit , \u201d when he testifies before the Senate Finance committee . WaPo has details . ]\nShutdown extender ? - Rank-and-file Republicans , already skeptical of House leadership , will be watching closely as Boehner & Co. return from their huddle with Obama . As Washington Examiner \u2019 s Byron York observes , the debt-limit concession by the right will let Republicans stand firm \u201c on their requirement that a continuing resolution to fund the government must contain some significant measure to limit Obamacare. \u201d That means that the shutdown drama could be just beginning . Without the debt ceiling to raise general alarm , Obama has less leverage . And Boehner would be without a powerful tool to keep his own conference in line .\n[ Latest AP poll : Obama disapproval : 37 % ( down 15 pts . since April ) // Country headed in wrong direction : 78 % ( up 22 pts . since April ) ]\nThe takeaway - The federal shutdown is proving less politically damaging to Republicans than expected , partly because of the maladroit moves by the administration . The refusal to provide death benefits to families of those killed in battle and the heavy-handed tactics at national parks have established a new narrative . Combined with Republican legislation to reopen uniformly popular government services , the shutdown has taken on a different hue . The president and congressional leaders are leaning toward revisiting the \u201c supercommittee \u201d concept from the 2011 debt-limit showdown . Such a move that would almost certainly mean any changes to Obama \u2019 s health law would be minor , if present at all . By leaving out the debt limit , conservatives hope to keep the troubled health law on the table , with more and more on the right calling for a one-year ObamaCare delay in exchange for full federal funding .\nWHAT DID HE KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT ? - President Obama , in an interview with WRC-TV of Washington , said about the Pentagon decision to suspend death benefits to the families of troops killed in the Afghan war : \u201c When I heard about this story , I told the Department of Defense , within our administrative powers , we should be able to get that fixed. \u201d But Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry reported that word of the decision had reached the top tier of the administration \u201c a few days ago. \u201d Who knew and when , exactly , the president was told ?

When we talk about a \u2018clean CR,\u2019 that sounds nice. It\u2019s clean, right? And the Republicans want a \u2018dirty CR\u2019 -- continuing resolution. I would say what the Republicans asking for is to deny the administration a blank check. That's what the Democrats and the bureaucracy are demanding. So it would be nice if we could undo that language where all of this stuff the Democrats are asking is inherently good, after all, clean is good. A blank check is a bad idea.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
