    "content": "Most of the residents of Ferguson , Missouri , are law-abiding citizens , but `` instigators '' have infiltrated the people protesting the death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown , said Sen. Claire McCaskill . `` The protesters have now been invaded . And embedded among them are a group of instigators \u2014 some coming from other states \u2014 that want a confrontation with the police , '' the senator from Missouri said on MSNBC 's `` Morning Joe '' on Tuesday.McCaskill said the situation is pitting those protesting Brown 's death by a police officer against the need for police to keep the community safe . She said it is the instigators who are posing the biggest problem for `` the wonderful people of Ferguson who want to be law-abiding . `` `` You 've got a situation where we have a clash between the First Amendment rights of protesters and the duty and obligation of law enforcement to keep those wonderful people safe . That is what you 're seeing play out in front of you , '' she said.McCaskill was critical of media reports of the violence and looting that has taken place in Ferguson following Brown 's death on Saturday , Aug. 9 . She said videos of tear gas are shown `` after shots have been fired . `` Shooters were aiming at `` protesters and the police , '' and the people injured were `` not being shot by the police , '' but by the instigators , the Missouri Democrat said.There also was too much media attention on `` confrontation , '' and not enough on the `` healing '' taking place in the community , she said , explaining there were `` all kinds of things going on the ground [ among ministers and community leaders ] , and it is not getting the coverage it deserves . `` Instability has continued in the evenings in Ferguson since Brown 's death . Local police originally worked to contain the unrest , but Gov . Jay Nixon called on the Missouri Highway Patrol on Thursday , Aug. 14 , to oversee the situation , with Capt . Ron Johnson in charge.As clashes continued , Nixon on Sunday then called out the National Guard to help restore order . At least two people were shot and 31 arrested Monday night in the St. Louis suburb.While she had `` confidence in local authorities '' to conduct a thorough investigation , McCaskill explained that involvement by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice would add credibility to the situation . President Barack Obama announced Monday he was sending Holder to Ferguson to aid in the investigation . `` I want to make sure that with Eric Holder 's visit tomorrow , that the people in the community are reassured that there is a very , very competent set of eyes looking over the shoulder of every state and local investigator in the community , '' she said.McCaskill warned against rushing the investigation , saying that releasing details too early could influence witness testimony . She said `` more people need to be talking about if [ investigators ] are doing it right . `` `` In a complicated scene like this , you have to take the time to make sure you 've checked and double-checked your physical evidence . And you ca n't let that out , or all of a sudden , the witnesses are going to be parroting back what they 've read , instead of what they really saw , '' she said.Officials were working to find solutions so that people could protest in peace , McCaskill said , adding that an area could be designated for demonstrations . `` Maybe [ we can find ] a public space that 's away from the business district , because I worry about the health and vibrancy of this community , too , as much as I worry about the safety and the fairness and the way they 're treated , '' she said.Protests could possibly be moved to a `` green space '' with `` minimal screening '' to ensure that people were n't carrying weapons , McCaskill said , indicating observation was already under way . `` Right now , there is surveillance going on . And there is a real effort to try to find the people who are actually wanting the confrontation and causing the violence , and seeing if we ca n't begin to be more aggressive about making arrests of those people with the guns , with the weapons , and therefore make it safe for everyone , '' McCaskill said.While officials `` over-policed for a few days '' following Brown 's death , and then `` completely under-policed , '' McCaskill said they were now doing `` what they feel they have to do to keep it safe under these dangerous circumstances with these instigators in town . `` McCaskill praised Obama 's `` tone '' in his plea for calm Monday against what he called the `` small minority '' undermining the peace in Ferguson . She said she had been on the phone with the president and Holder a `` number of times '' to discuss the situation.Due to the high tensions in Ferguson that had no clear-cut resolution in sight , critics have called for Obama to visit the city . McCaskill said local resources were already stretched thin , given what an appearance by Obama would entail . `` A presidential visit requires a lot of security from local officials . Right now , our local officials have their hands full . It is a very bad time for a presidential visit for the practical reasons of these guys . Many of these people are not getting enough sleep . We are really taxing all the jurisdictions on the police forces . So , it 's a bad idea , '' she said.McCaskill said she hated to see `` all these great small businesses in Ferguson suffering so terribly , because their community is being portrayed in a way that frankly is just not true , '' adding it remained `` perfectly safe in Ferguson during the day .
