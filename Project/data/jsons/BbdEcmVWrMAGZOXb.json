Rolls-Royce and more Mercedes . But how did Kim manage to get these luxury , bulletproof vehicles \u2014 in open violation of an international ban on luxury goods \u2014 to North North Korea ? To answer this question , we teamed up with the non-profit research group Center for Advanced Defense Studies , which published a detailed report on sanctions evasions .

So first , let \u2019 s take a look at the actual route . And the trail starts : in a shipping terminal in Rotterdam in June 2018 . The first part of the journey looks like a regular shipment .
