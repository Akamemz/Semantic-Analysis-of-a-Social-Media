''\nRyan , 42 , is considered a policy wonk and conservative Catholic likely to energize the GOP base and sharpen the campaign 's focus on government spending and the economy .\nThat could boost Romney 's appeal among middle-of-the-road Catholic voters in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania , though Ryan offers little in the way of foreign policy experience .\nThe House Budget Committee chairman was chosen ahead of Sen.
