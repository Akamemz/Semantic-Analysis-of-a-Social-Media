    "content": "Hillary Clinton will already make history with her nomination for president , becoming the first woman to lead a major presidential ticket . Now the question is whether she wants to do it again with her choice of running mate .\nClinton is expected to name her vice presidential pick sometime after the Republican National Convention ends and before her own convention begins in Philadelphia on July 25 .\nOn her list are several Hispanic lawmakers , African-Americans and at least one woman .\nLatino politicians like Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro offer an appealing contrast to Donald Trump 's controversial comments on Mexican immigrants , plus he would bring youth to her ticket .\nShe also has a close relationship with Labor Secretary Tom Perez , who is beloved by labor unions .\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren would excite supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . Brown has been a vocal opponent of free trade agreements and is one of the Senate 's most liberal members , while Warren was the original progressive hero who has long railed against Wall Street .\nBut both Brown and Warren , along with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker , have a big complicating factor \u2014 they come from states with Republican governors who would nominate their replacements if the Clinton ticket wins . And with control of the Senate hanging in the balance this November too , losing a Senate seat may be too risky of a gamble for Democrats .\nUltimately though , Clinton may go with a safer , non-historic pick . Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine is a solid choice who was a finalist in President Obama 's search eight years ago . Kaine himself has admitted he is a `` boring '' choice , but boring is n't necessarily a bad thing in politics , and he does come from a swing state too .\nThat 's the same with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , who has emerged as a late , top possible pick for Clinton . The former Iowa governor comes from an important state and is a longtime friend of the Clintons too .\nBelow are some of the potential candidates Clinton 's team is weighing . Check out Trump 's potential VPs here .\nAge : 58 ( born Jan. 26 , 1958 , in Sacramento , Calif. ) Current residence : Los Angeles Education : 1980 , Stanford University , B.A . ; 1984 , Stanford University , J.D .

Elected to Congress in 1992 , he previously served in the state Assembly and was the California deputy attorney general . In 2008 , President Obama offered him the position of U.S. trade representative , but he turned it down , saying he would have more influence in Congress . Becerra has stumped for Clinton in both English and Spanish and could be a powerful voice for her on issues of immigration .

During his seven years as Newark mayor , he became well-known for shoveling residents ' driveways after snowstorms , rescuing a woman from a house fire and living on food stamps . Booker could energize African-Americans and young voters . But as a freshman senator , his experience will be a question ( even though he has served the same amount of time that Barack Obama did before becoming president ) .

He also would help with reaching blue-collar Democrats who might be swayed by Donald Trump 's populist appeal . He has been a strong surrogate for Clinton when it comes to labor issues .
