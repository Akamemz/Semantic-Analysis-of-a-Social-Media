    "content": "Mick Mulvaney \u2019 s friends in the House Freedom Caucus couldn \u2019 t believe what they were hearing .\nIt was the Monday night following Election Day , and lawmakers were trickling back into Washington to resume their congressional duties . The next day , House Republicans would hold closed-door elections to choose their leadership for the upcoming 115th Congress , and little drama was expected . Paul Ryan had angered many of the members by abandoning Donald Trump \u2019 s candidacy a month before the election , but the president-elect had quickly and mercifully made it known that he wanted Ryan to remain speaker , extinguishing the fantasies of some conservatives who had plotted to overthrow him in the November 14 party elections .\nAs the Freedom Caucus \u2019 s nine-person board gathered for its preliminary briefing prior to the weekly meeting with the full membership , Jim Jordan , the group \u2019 s no-nonsense chairman , broke some awkward news : Mulvaney , a board member , would formally nominate Ryan for speaker the next day . Some colleagues thought Jordan was joking ; he assured them he was not . Word quickly spread to the entire group , and when Mulvaney \u2014 who was running late \u2014 arrived for the full meeting , he was greeted with a chorus of angry expletives . According to multiple sources in the room , Mulvaney offered a simple explanation for his decision to so ostentatiously support Ryan : The speaker had asked him to . His comrades threw up their hands . \u201c What else would you do if he asked you to ? \u201d Justin Amash , Mulvaney \u2019 s friend and a fellow board member , bellowed at him .\nThings were about to get worse . As Jordan , a former collegiate wrestling champion , raised his voice to demand a verbal cease-fire , Mulvaney inadvertently let the cat out of the bag . \u201c I was going to vote for Jim , but he \u2019 s not running now. \u201d The room froze . \u201c Oh , s * * * , \u201d someone said . Before the election , Jordan , anticipating a Trump loss and an anti-Ryan backlash , had decided to run for the speakership himself , as Politico reported last month . But , worried that his plan would leak , he had kept it from many of the Freedom Caucus members \u2014 and then quietly nixed it after Trump \u2019 s victory and subsequent show of support for Ryan .\nThat Jordan , who has been famously reluctant to run for leadership , would plot against the speaker \u2014 and that Mulvaney \u2019 s colleagues would cuss him out for nominating Ryan \u2014 reflects simmering frustrations on the right with the man who succeeded John Boehner . Much of it , several members say , stems from the speaker \u2019 s \u201c holier than thou \u201d attitude toward Trump during the campaign , and specifically his announcement on October 10 that he would focus on House races from then until Election Day and do nothing to support Trump . ( Ryan went back on that , later urging voters to support Trump , but the damage was done . ) In retrospect , Ryan \u2019 s allies say , it was an emotional response to the freshly leaked Access Hollywood tape and an unforced error : The speaker was already focusing virtually all his efforts on House campaigns , and could have continued to do so quietly . Instead , he made a grand declaration that reeked of opportunism to his enemies . \u201c He was trying to sabotage Trump , that \u2019 s what we think , \u201d one Freedom Caucus member tells me . \u201c This was about him positioning to run in 2020. \u201d Ryan \u2019 s team laughs at this accusation , but there \u2019 s no question his about-face on Trump \u2014 accusing him of racism and later disowning his candidacy , only to embrace him in the aftermath of victory \u2014 has hurt his credibility in certain circles .\nThe entire episode , however , is about much more than Ryan and his role in a party that now belongs to Trump . It speaks to something fundamental about how the anti-establishment forces in American politics have been emboldened by Trump \u2019 s ascent and are eager to capitalize on this moment of upheaval . Many in the GOP believe they are entering a metamorphic period in the modern histories of both Republicanism and conservatism , one in which their intertwined loyalties and ideologies and dogmas could be scrambled and realigned . Conservatives in particular tend to believe this is a good thing , and rejoice in the reality that Trump , while not philosophically allied with them in some areas , nonetheless represents the culmination of their years-long assault on the establishment .\nThis explains why , eight days after Trump \u2019 s victory , the Conservative Action Project \u2014 an umbrella group for prominent activists \u2014 held a celebratory gathering at the Ritz-Carlton in Tyson \u2019 s Corner , Va. Attendees included some hardline conservatives who remained opposed to Trump throughout the election season ; they were surprised to hear Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint talk about the party \u2019 s finally being unified , and stunned at the glowing remarks about Trump from Ed Meese , Ronald Reagan \u2019 s former attorney general and an icon in the conservative movement .\nIt also explains why , over the next three days , a sister organization \u2014 the Council for National Policy \u2014 met at the same location and focused not on the risks Trump poses to conservatism but on the opportunities at hand . There were panels featuring economists Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore , both of whom are expected to work in Trump \u2019 s administration ; Meese and Family Research Council president Tony Perkins ; and Tom DeLay , who starred in a discussion entitled \u201c Make Congress Great Again. \u201d Nary a negative nor cautionary remark was made about Trump the entire weekend , attendees say .\nAnd finally , it explains why most Freedom Caucus members refused to criticize Trump during the GOP primary , and why they enthusiastically backed him during the general : He didn \u2019 t run on the same promises of ideological purity that they did , but he spread the same message of disrupting the status quo in D.C .\n\u201c Trump has demonstrated a willingness to be bold and take on the establishment . That \u2019 s exactly what the House Freedom Caucus has been willing to do , \u201d Jordan tells me . \u201c I think we have a lot more in common than we have differences . \u201d\nAll of this is a gamble , of course , as Trump \u2019 s ideology is disjointed at best and his core philosophy on the appropriate role of government is anyone \u2019 s guess . So while his presidency represents a prime opportunity for conservatives to influence the direction of the party and the country , it also threatens to redefine Republicanism in a way that is hostile toward traditional concepts of limited government . In some areas , no doubt , Trump \u2019 s agenda will mesh nicely with these principles . When it inevitably does not , conservatives will find themselves facing a quandary : Fall in line and risk damaging the credibility of conservatism , or push back and risk provoking a thin-skinned and Twitter-addicted president .\nWill Congress dare to flout recent history and serve as a principled check on the executive ?\nFurther complicating things is the fact that Trump dominated \u2014 in the primary and general elections \u2014 those districts represented by Congress \u2019 s most conservative members . They once believed they were elected to advance a narrowly ideological agenda , but Trump \u2019 s success has given them reason to question that belief . Knowing this , GOP leadership officials are betting that Trump \u2019 s popularity among conservative constituents will make their representatives less obstructionist and therefore less influential in the upcoming Congress .\n\u201c I think you \u2019 re going to see us sticking together more . I think there is less ability for the Freedom Caucus to do those types of things , \u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a Washington Post breakfast in late November . \u201c I \u2019 m sure those districts Donald Trump probably did the best in . It would be hard for them to stand up , if a President Trump is asking for this fundamental change , and they \u2019 re saying no . \u201d\nJordan called McCarthy \u2019 s comments \u201c laughable. \u201d Yet he has reason for concern . He knows that only three Freedom Caucus members \u2014 Steve Pearce of New Mexico , Trent Franks of Arizona , and Ted Poe of Texas \u2014 have been around long enough to defy a Republican president . And he knows that some of his group \u2019 s most reliably bold members won \u2019 t be there in the next Congress .\nMulvaney is one of them . In June , he conceded there had been surprisingly little conservative opposition to Trump but promised that Freedom Caucus members would hold the Republican nominee to the same standard as they did to Obama \u2014 particularly on the issue of executive power . \u201c I \u2019 m not concerned about Donald Trump shredding the Constitution , because I know the people who stand in the House between him and the Constitution , \u201d Mulvaney told me at the time . \u201c We \u2019 ve been fighting against an imperial presidency for five and a half years . Every time we go to the floor and push back against an overreaching president , we get accused of being partisan at best and racist at worst . When we do it against a Republican president , maybe people will see that it was a principled objection in the first place . So we actually welcome that opportunity . It might actually be fun , being a strict-constitutionalist congressman doing battle with a non-strict-constitutionalist Republican president . \u201d\nMulvaney was recently named director of the Office of Management and Budget , the powerful agency that supervises and coordinates the government \u2019 s financial planning . The week before he was chosen , I asked Mulvaney whether he stood by his promises about congressional Republicans \u2019 holding Trump accountable . He declined to comment , because he was waiting to hear back from New York about the OMB post .\nFreedom Caucus members \u2014 and Ryan , notably \u2014 issued ecstatic statements lauding Mulvaney \u2019 s selection as a sign of Trump \u2019 s commitment to fiscal responsibility . That \u2019 s one way of looking at it . Another way is this : Trump just sidelined one of the House \u2019 s most outspoken conservatives , someone who repeatedly stood up to Republican leadership , thereby weakening potential intra-party resistance to his administration \u2019 s initiatives .\nThese dueling outlooks frame an essential and defining question for Republicans entering the era of Trump : With unified control of government and a president who bullied his way into the White House , will Congress dare to flout recent history and serve as a principled check on the executive ?\nThere is some reason to believe that conservatives will be intellectually consistent in their intra-party oppositions . After all , thanks to a bare 52-seat Senate majority , some combination of Rand Paul , Mike Lee , Ted Cruz , Ben Sasse , and Marco Rubio can easily derail GOP-only legislation . In the House , the Freedom Caucus \u2019 s core membership has repeatedly shown an appetite for internecine rumbling . And even within the administration , prominent conservatives \u2014 Mulvaney at OMB , Tom Price at Health and Human Services \u2014 could push back on the president if he strays from small-government doctrine .\nBut one-party rule has a way of silencing dissent , especially if the president has sustained popularity with the base . It \u2019 s hardly a stretch to imagine Trump spending his first year amassing voter goodwill by passing robust tax cuts and approving a massive , shovel-ready infrastructure package , only to steadily grow the size of government ( and the power of the executive ) while daring congressional Republicans to stop him . Everyone knows George W. Bush doubled the national debt ; not everyone recalls that his first OMB director was Mitch Daniels , perhaps the most revered fiscal hawk of his generation .\nThe speaker of the House is particularly sensitive to this reality . Before he was a conservative darling with unflinching budget proposals , Ryan was a rank-and-file House Republican who voted for No Child Left Behind , Medicare Part D , and the bank bailouts . Many conservatives \u2014 including Vice President\u2013elect Mike Pence \u2014 believe it was these betrayals of principle , as much as the Affordable Care Act or anything Obama pursued , that inspired the Tea Party \u2019 s ascent in 2010 . Pence , who voted against all three of the aforementioned bills , told me before Election Day that the Republican party \u201c lost its way \u201d under Bush and ignited the anti-establishment insurgency that would eventually result in Trump \u2019 s victory .\nBut Pence himself is now a subordinate to Trump ; his charge is to influence policymaking from within , not lead the opposition from without . And Ryan \u2014 who has no track record of opposing his party \u2019 s leadership , and whose speakership was likely spared by Trump \u2014 isn \u2019 t exactly positioned to challenge the president-elect , either . Trump compared Ryan to \u201c a fine wine \u201d during a recent joint appearance in Wisconsin , but he had a warning for the speaker as well : \u201c Every day goes by , I get to appreciate his genius more and more , \u201d Trump said of Ryan . \u201c Now , if he ever goes against me , I \u2019 m not going to say that , okay ? \u2019 \u201d\nThe morning after Election Day , when I asked Ryan during a press conference about his branch \u2019 s role in checking the executive \u2014 and avoiding the mistakes of the GOP under Bush \u2014 he was circumspect in his reply . \u201c I think the mistakes of the Republican government [ were ] that we didn \u2019 t do the right thing at the right time , \u201d he said . \u201c I think the mistake that we made in the past is we didn \u2019 t seize the opportunity when it presented itself . The opportunity is now here . \u201d\nWhen Ryan talks about doing \u201c the right thing , \u201d he \u2019 s voicing regret that Republicans refused to act boldly \u2014 by reforming Social Security , for instance \u2014 when they controlled government . But he \u2019 s also touching on something more foundational . \u201c The opportunity \u201d Ryan says that Republicans squandered under Bush was to prove that their party was committed to principles of limited government . Ryan now sees the chance to right both wrongs \u2014 to accomplish significant things , and accomplish them in a conservative way \u2014 with a unified government .\nBut Ryan \u2014 and Pence , for that matter \u2014 will be focused more on the former goal than on the latter . That is not to say they \u2019 ll champion progressive proposals , but rather that the responsibility of pushing hard for the most conservative version of any undertaking will fall to Congress , and in most cases the House . It \u2019 s true that the GOP has just a narrow majority in the Senate , and that some Republican senators already have shown a willingness to tangle with Trump . ( Cruz , who built his brand as an intra-party agitator , is expected to tread carefully owing to his complex history with Trump as well as his looming Senate reelection campaign . ) But there are also numerous red- and purple-state Democrats eager to work with the new administration ahead of their own tough reelections in 2018 , thus providing cushion for maneuvering in an upper chamber that was less ideological to begin with .\nOne-party rule has a way of silencing dissent , especially if the president has sustained popularity with the base .\nIt \u2019 s a different story in the House , where Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi can often whip her caucus en masse against GOP measures . Republicans will control 241 seats in the next Congress ( assuming the party keeps a handful of special-election seats ) and 218 are needed to approve legislation , meaning Ryan can lose only 23 GOP votes . The Freedom Caucus will number roughly 40 , which ensures two things : It will control the margin needed to pass Republican-only bills , and it will be positioned as the first and last line of defense against Trump .\nSome Freedom Caucus members \u2014 Jordan , Justin Amash of Michigan , Mark Sanford of South Carolina \u2014 are considered immovable . But many of the group \u2019 s rank-and-file members are relatively new to Congress and have been tag-alongs , rather than instigators , in the fights against GOP leadership . They represent heavily pro-Trump districts and might have no appetite for conflict . \u201c Some of these guys still get nervous when they get called to the speaker \u2019 s office , \u201d one Freedom Caucus member tells me . \u201c What happens when Trump calls them to the Oval ? \u201d\nMuddying the picture further is the fact that some of the House \u2019 s most stalwart conservatives have just left Congress or soon will . Mulvaney , of course , is headed to OMB . Scott Garrett , a Freedom Caucus board member , lost a hard-fought reelection battle in his New Jersey district . Louisiana \u2019 s John Fleming , also a board member , gave up his House seat to run unsuccessfully for the Senate . Raul Labrador , another board member , has been one of the most outspoken critics of GOP leadership \u2014 but colleagues say he \u2019 s decided to run for governor of Idaho , a decision that might remove him from the front lines of some intra-party fights , and would remove him from the House altogether in 2018 . Tim Huelskamp , who has voted as often against Republican legislation as anyone , lost his primary in Kansas \u2019 s first district . Matt Salmon , a highly respected conservative who was considered a universally acceptable successor to Jordan as Freedom Caucus chairman , retired this year .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Mark Meadows , the group \u2019 s incoming chairman , who arrived with the second wave of tea-partiers in 2012 . The small-businessman from North Carolina stayed mostly behind the scenes until July 2015 , when , against the wishes of some Freedom Caucus colleagues , he filed an obscure procedural motion aimed at ousting Boehner . It unexpectedly worked , and Meadows gained something of a cult following in the conservative base , which he has expertly parlayed into a more prominent role in the conservative movement .\nThe question now is how aggressively Meadows will position the group to Trump \u2019 s right . Several members have raised concerns about Meadows \u2019 s perceived coziness with the president-elect \u2014 they hit it off while traveling together in North Carolina during the campaign \u2014 and his transition team , specifically chief strategist Stephen Bannon , the former executive chairman of Breitbart News , with whom Meadows talks frequently . There was a heated internal exchange , members say , on November 30 when Breitbart.com published a story with the headline \u201d Exclusive \u2014 Rep. Mark Meadows : House Conservatives Ready on Day One to Help Donald Trump. \u201d Meadows isn \u2019 t the only one being scrutinized . Dave Brat , the former economics professor who defeated Eric Cantor in 2014 , was recently elected to the Freedom Caucus board for the 115th Congress . His nickname in the group : \u201c Bratbart , \u201d for his love of the far-right website and determination to stay in its good graces .\nThat said , while the Freedom Caucus \u2019 s fondness for Trump is somewhat surprising , Meadows \u2019 s association with Bannon is smart and strategic . House conservatives are increasingly worried that Ryan \u2019 s close personal relationship with Reince Priebus , Trump \u2019 s chief of staff , will result in backroom deals that diminish their ability to influence legislation . This seemed to be foreshadowed by a December incident in which Jordan informed Ryan of his intention to proceed with an effort to impeach the IRS Commissioner . Ryan \u2019 s office objected , and when Jordan ignored them , sources say the Freedom Caucus chairman got a sudden call from Priebus \u2014 whose phone number Jordan didn \u2019 t recognize \u2014 asking him to please hold back . Jordan pushed ahead , all the more motivated after Ryan \u2019 s apparent decision to enlist Priebus to stop him . ( Jordan \u2019 s resolution was rejected on the House floor and referred back to committee . )\nIf there \u2019 s a tug-of-war in the White House for influence over Trump and his agenda \u2014 pitting Priebus the establishment insider against Bannon the populist outsider \u2014 it makes sense that Ryan and the congressional leadership are partnering with Priebus while Meadows and Freedom Caucus members are allying themselves with Bannon . But these tensions may not manifest anytime soon . Meadows believes that Trump \u2019 s agenda out of the gate is likely to unify Republicans and suppress any internal conflicts . \u201c In the first 200 days , we \u2019 ve got enough where we agree on that I don \u2019 t see a lot of areas for battles with the administration , \u201d he tells me .\nHouse conservatives are increasingly worried that Ryan \u2019 s close personal relationship with Reince Priebus , Trump \u2019 s chief of staff , will result in backroom deals that diminish their ability to influence legislation .\nMeadows is probably right that Republicans won \u2019 t fight a civil war at the dawn of Trump \u2019 s administration , but that doesn \u2019 t mean there won \u2019 t be some fascinating ideological modulation to monitor . Consider Trump \u2019 s stated intention to seek a $ 1 trillion dollar infrastructure package soon after taking office . At a conservative forum one week after the election , Labrador told reporters that any such bill \u201c has to be paid for \u201d with spending cuts or revenues from elsewhere , \u201c and if Trump doesn \u2019 t find a way to pay for it , the majority of us , if not all of us , are going to vote against it. \u201d Otherwise , conservatives reasoned , it would be no different than the Obama stimulus package they once railed against . But their thinking has shifted in the weeks since . According to several members , there has been informal talk of accepting a bill that \u2019 s only 50 percent paid for , with the rest of the borrowing being offset down the road by \u201c economic growth. \u201d It \u2019 s an arrangement Republicans would never have endorsed under a President Hillary Clinton , and a slippery slope to go down with Trump .\nAnother example is the repeal of Obamacare . Pro-life leaders met quietly in Washington the week after Election Day and plotted to pressure Republican leaders to defund Planned Parenthood in the process of repealing the outgoing president \u2019 s signature health-care law early next year , and the idea has conservatives \u2019 support . \u201c This will be a good test : Can we really defund Planned Parenthood ? \u201d Jordan tells me . \u201c We have to . I mean , come on . . . . It had better happen. \u201d But congressional leaders , and Trump , who sang the group \u2019 s praises during the campaign , might not want that particular fight at that particular time . If they don \u2019 t , expect a showdown between social conservatives and the president they helped elect .\nIn these instances and potentially many more \u2014 his refusal to touch entitlement programs , his desire to borrow historic amounts without regard for the national debt \u2014 traditional conservatives might be abruptly reminded that Trump is not one of them . Their decision , either to follow his lead or push back in defense of the principles that have defined modern conservatism , will go a long way toward determining whether Trump is successful in remaking the party in his image .\nIn the six weeks since Trump \u2019 s triumph , many conservatives have shooed away these questions , arguing that nobody knows how he will govern until he actually takes office on January 20 . They are understandably reluctant to preemptively criticize an incoming president who \u2019 s popular with their constituents back home \u2014 and who could jeopardize their political careers and livelihoods with a single retaliatory tweet . Indeed , some normally talkative lawmakers agreed to discuss the upcoming Congress only if they were not quoted .\nIt \u2019 s this culture of intimidation that helps to explain why conservatives weren \u2019 t publicly irate with the incoming administration for offering Carrier $ 7 million in tax breaks and incentives to keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Pence \u2019 s home state of Indiana .\nThe Carrier deal is a textbook example of the \u201c crony capitalism \u201d conservatives have fought against \u2014 as Sarah Palin pointed out \u2014 and part of a propaganda campaign in which Trump is attempting to demonstrate before taking office that his election has already helped American workers . Yet the response from Republican leaders , including Ryan , who for years has warned that the government should not pick winners and losers , was to celebrate the deal . Most conservatives kept quiet , too , one notable exception being Amash , a libertarian-leaning Michigan Republican with a fierce independent streak . \u201c More corporate welfare and cronyism , \u201d Amash tweeted in response to the Carrier news . \u201c Equal protection is denied when one company receives favors at the expense of everyone else in Indiana . \u201d\nMeadows has a different take . \u201c I don \u2019 t know of any federal benefit that [ Trump ] promised them other than tax reform and regulatory reform , \u201d he tells me . \u201c Everyone wants to talk about crony capitalism , but he didn \u2019 t encourage them to do anything that states aren \u2019 t already doing anyway . \u201d\nThis reaction is telling . Some Republicans want to reserve any alarm-sounding for when Trump clearly oversteps a line \u2014 executive overreach will be closely monitored after the GOP allowed Bush to drastically expand the power of the presidency \u2014 but avoid disputes over every little perceived breach of conservative orthodoxy . To them , the Carrier deal seems like small potatoes ; to others , however , it \u2019 s the possible foreshadowing of a party swapping out free-market principles for a nationalistic approach to economics .\nIn the era of Trump , the very definition of conservatism seems up for grabs .\nDavid McIntosh , the Club for Growth president and former Indiana congressman who has been Pence \u2019 s friend for two decades , says the Carrier deal set \u201c a terrible precedent \u201d and that he was \u201c surprised and disappointed to hear [ Pence ] say that the marketplace didn \u2019 t work in this case. \u201d But McIntosh nevertheless continues to believe Pence is conservatives \u2019 best hope of positively influencing Trump . \u201c What I saw him do during the campaign was kind of reinterpret \u2018 Make America Great Again \u2019 into a list of conservative initiatives , \u201d McIntosh says . \u201c The Carrier thing was disappointing because he didn \u2019 t do that , and it kind of seemed like they were giving up on the free market and talking about tariffs instead . \u201d\nMcIntosh hopes Carrier is a \u201c one-off thing , \u201d but what if it \u2019 s not ? Ten days after the election , Bannon put the party on notice in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter . \u201c We \u2019 re going to build an entirely new political movement , \u201d he boasted . \u201c The conservatives are going to go crazy . I \u2019 m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan . With negative interest rates throughout the world , it \u2019 s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything . Ship yards , iron works , get them all jacked up . We \u2019 re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks . It will be as exciting as the 1930s , greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives , plus populists , in an economic nationalist movement . \u201d\nBannon is correct that traditional conservatives wouldn \u2019 t support the agenda he describes . But in the era of Trump , the very definition of conservatism seems up for grabs . \u201c Populism \u201d has become the new buzzword on the right ; Jordan , in our interview , made repeated references to \u201c populist-conservative policy , \u201d advocating the suddenly chic notion of a marriage between Trump \u2019 s everyman appeal and the tea party \u2019 s ideological purity .\nIt \u2019 s not clear , however , that such a merger is even possible . \u201d Populism as an ideology is not ideological . Populism basically says , \u2018 There \u2019 s a parade coming down the street and I \u2019 d better get out there because I \u2019 m their leader , \u2019 \u201d says Arthur Brooks , president of the American Enterprise Institute .\nFor instance , Trump \u2019 s threat to penalize companies that ship jobs overseas might excite a blue-collar worker in rural , red America , but the idea is likely to be fundamentally incompatible with the ideology preached by the politician who represents that worker \u2019 s district . The politician in question might agonize over the violation of conservative orthodoxy , Brooks says , but when regular people are forced to choose between their livelihoods and a set of abstract principles , it \u2019 s a no-brainer .\nConservatives must now be careful not to oppose their party on principles that are no longer relevant or advantageous to the people they represent .\n\u201c Americans are not very ideological . Americans have some moral principles , which is great , but they \u2019 re really practical , \u201d Brooks tells me . The idea of a \u201c populist-conservative \u201d hybrid , then , might afford politicians and parties a flexibility they previously lacked to experiment with policies and expand the party \u2019 s philosophical boundaries free from accusations of apostasy . \u201c I think that what people are saying is not a logical fallacy , \u201d Brooks adds . \u201c What they \u2019 re saying is that the ideas and actions of Donald Trump [ are ] going to wind up affecting how American conservatism understands itself , because the actions he takes that work will ultimately be adopted by the conservative playbook . \u201d\nTo that point : If Pence , who was once arguably the most ideological Republican in Congress , can be persuaded by Trump to stop supporting multinational trade deals and offer tax breaks to Carrier , it \u2019 s not hard to imagine Freedom Caucus members adapting to a new and different mandate from their constituents in the era of Trump .\nIndeed , conservatives must now be careful not to oppose their party on principles that are no longer relevant or advantageous to the people they represent . Huelskamp \u2019 s \u201c Big First \u201d district in Kansas is deeply conservative , but it also boasts one of the nation \u2019 s premier farming constituencies . So when he voted against the Farm Bill in 2013 \u2014 after he \u2019 d already been kicked off the Agriculture Committee for other protest votes \u2014 he made himself uniquely vulnerable to a primary challenge from a more moderate Republican . It was previously unimaginable that a tea-party lawmaker could lose to someone running to their left in a conservative district . But that \u2019 s just what happened : Roger Marshall , a physician , promised to make the government more responsive to the agricultural interests of the district \u2014 a far cry from the message of getting government out of the way , period \u2014 and knocked off Huelskamp by 13 points .\nThe episode put a scare into conservatives , who saw establishment Republicans emboldened after claiming their first Freedom Caucus scalp and wondered who would be targeted next . This is part of Jordan \u2019 s reasoning for stepping down as the group \u2019 s chairman , according to sources familiar with his thinking . Most Freedom Caucus members have little cash in their campaign accounts and are therefore susceptible to primary challenges from better-financed , establishment-backed candidates . Jordan will now be devoting time and energy to growing the House Freedom Fund , his leadership PAC , with the aim of defending those members . Jordan , sources say , has even consulted Chris Wilson , the Republican data guru who ran the Cruz presidential campaign \u2019 s analytics outfit , about working on behalf of the group and its most vulnerable members .\nJordan \u2019 s efforts might take on added urgency with Trump in the White House . Though conservatives believe the president-elect to be an ally , they also recognize his fickle nature , which has been a source of frequent internal conversations . Even if they support Trump nine times of ten , voting against him once could trigger a tweetstorm or the threat of a visit to their district . It \u2019 s a chilling thought for members who know that the Republican National Committee , the National Republican Congressional Committee , and the House GOP leadership already want them gone .\nTrump \u2019 s presidency might signal heightened influence for conservatives ; it could also trigger an establishment-orchestrated purge of members who dare to defy his priorities .\n\u201c Most of these members have every incentive to be cooperative . There \u2019 s a strong pro-Trump vote in their districts . They \u2019 re naturally inclined to be cooperative with the president under these circumstances , \u201d says Matthew Spalding , a longtime Heritage Foundation official who runs Hillsdale College \u2019 s Kirby Center campus in Washington . \u201c The president-elect will have every opportunity to challenge them . And if they \u2019 re oppositional , in the midterms he could run his own candidates . \u201d\n# related # There \u2019 s no way yet of knowing how aggressively , if at all , Trump will steer the party away from traditional conservative orthodoxy \u2014 or how aggressively Republicans in his administration and in Congress will fight him . But if there \u2019 s a lesson to be learned from the last time the GOP controlled all of government , it \u2019 s that there are lasting consequences to abandoning the party \u2019 s foundational values .\n\u201c If we as conservatives lose our bearings , if we go the wrong direction \u2014 we \u2019 ve seen that in the past , we saw Republicans stray away in the \u2019 70s , we saw Republicans stray away from the core principles during the Bush 43 presidency \u2014 if we stray away , then that will provide the particle that allows the Democratic party to come back , \u201d Texas congressman Bill Flores , the outgoing chairman of the Republican Study Committee , said during a recent forum at the American Enterprise Institute .\nThen again , if congressional Republicans are as deferential to Donald Trump as they were to George W. Bush , conservatives shouldn \u2019 t be concerned about the 45th president straying from the party \u2019 s core principles . They should worry that he \u2019 ll redefine those principles altogether .",
    "content_original": "(Reuters photo: Lucas Jackson)\n\nWhere does the Right go from here?\n\nMick Mulvaney\u2019s friends in the House Freedom Caucus couldn\u2019t believe what they were hearing.\n\nIt was the Monday night following Election Day, and lawmakers were trickling back into Washington to resume their congressional duties. The next day, House Republicans would hold closed-door elections to choose their leadership for the upcoming 115th Congress, and little drama was expected. Paul Ryan had angered many of the members by abandoning Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy a month before the election, but the president-elect had quickly and mercifully made it known that he wanted Ryan to remain speaker, extinguishing the fantasies of some conservatives who had plotted to overthrow him in the November 14 party elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Freedom Caucus\u2019s nine-person board gathered for its preliminary briefing prior to the weekly meeting with the full membership, Jim Jordan, the group\u2019s no-nonsense chairman, broke some awkward news: Mulvaney, a board member, would formally nominate Ryan for speaker the next day. Some colleagues thought Jordan was joking; he assured them he was not. Word quickly spread to the entire group, and when Mulvaney \u2014 who was running late \u2014 arrived for the full meeting, he was greeted with a chorus of angry expletives. According to multiple sources in the room, Mulvaney offered a simple explanation for his decision to so ostentatiously support Ryan: The speaker had asked him to. His comrades threw up their hands. \u201cWhat else would you do if he asked you to?\u201d Justin Amash, Mulvaney\u2019s friend and a fellow board member, bellowed at him.\n\nThings were about to get worse. As Jordan, a former collegiate wrestling champion, raised his voice to demand a verbal cease-fire, Mulvaney inadvertently let the cat out of the bag. \u201cI was going to vote for Jim, but he\u2019s not running now.\u201d The room froze. \u201cOh, s***,\u201d someone said. Before the election, Jordan, anticipating a Trump loss and an anti-Ryan backlash, had decided to run for the speakership himself, as Politico reported last month. But, worried that his plan would leak, he had kept it from many of the Freedom Caucus members \u2014 and then quietly nixed it after Trump\u2019s victory and subsequent show of support for Ryan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Jordan, who has been famously reluctant to run for leadership, would plot against the speaker \u2014 and that Mulvaney\u2019s colleagues would cuss him out for nominating Ryan \u2014 reflects simmering frustrations on the right with the man who succeeded John Boehner. Much of it, several members say, stems from the speaker\u2019s \u201cholier than thou\u201d attitude toward Trump during the campaign, and specifically his announcement on October 10 that he would focus on House races from then until Election Day and do nothing to support Trump. (Ryan went back on that, later urging voters to support Trump, but the damage was done.) In retrospect, Ryan\u2019s allies say, it was an emotional response to the freshly leaked Access Hollywood tape and an unforced error: The speaker was already focusing virtually all his efforts on House campaigns, and could have continued to do so quietly. Instead, he made a grand declaration that reeked of opportunism to his enemies. \u201cHe was trying to sabotage Trump, that\u2019s what we think,\u201d one Freedom Caucus member tells me. \u201cThis was about him positioning to run in 2020.\u201d Ryan\u2019s team laughs at this accusation, but there\u2019s no question his about-face on Trump \u2014 accusing him of racism and later disowning his candidacy, only to embrace him in the aftermath of victory \u2014 has hurt his credibility in certain circles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire episode, however, is about much more than Ryan and his role in a party that now belongs to Trump. It speaks to something fundamental about how the anti-establishment forces in American politics have been emboldened by Trump\u2019s ascent and are eager to capitalize on this moment of upheaval. Many in the GOP believe they are entering a metamorphic period in the modern histories of both Republicanism and conservatism, one in which their intertwined loyalties and ideologies and dogmas could be scrambled and realigned. Conservatives in particular tend to believe this is a good thing, and rejoice in the reality that Trump, while not philosophically allied with them in some areas, nonetheless represents the culmination of their years-long assault on the establishment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis explains why, eight days after Trump\u2019s victory, the Conservative Action Project \u2014 an umbrella group for prominent activists \u2014 held a celebratory gathering at the Ritz-Carlton in Tyson\u2019s Corner, Va. Attendees included some hardline conservatives who remained opposed to Trump throughout the election season; they were surprised to hear Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint talk about the party\u2019s finally being unified, and stunned at the glowing remarks about Trump from Ed Meese, Ronald Reagan\u2019s former attorney general and an icon in the conservative movement.\n\nIt also explains why, over the next three days, a sister organization \u2014 the Council for National Policy \u2014 met at the same location and focused not on the risks Trump poses to conservatism but on the opportunities at hand. There were panels featuring economists Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore, both of whom are expected to work in Trump\u2019s administration; Meese and Family Research Council president Tony Perkins; and Tom DeLay, who starred in a discussion entitled \u201cMake Congress Great Again.\u201d Nary a negative nor cautionary remark was made about Trump the entire weekend, attendees say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd finally, it explains why most Freedom Caucus members refused to criticize Trump during the GOP primary, and why they enthusiastically backed him during the general: He didn\u2019t run on the same promises of ideological purity that they did, but he spread the same message of disrupting the status quo in D.C.\n\n\u201cTrump has demonstrated a willingness to be bold and take on the establishment. That\u2019s exactly what the House Freedom Caucus has been willing to do,\u201d Jordan tells me. \u201cI think we have a lot more in common than we have differences.\u201d\n\nAll of this is a gamble, of course, as Trump\u2019s ideology is disjointed at best and his core philosophy on the appropriate role of government is anyone\u2019s guess. So while his presidency represents a prime opportunity for conservatives to influence the direction of the party and the country, it also threatens to redefine Republicanism in a way that is hostile toward traditional concepts of limited government. In some areas, no doubt, Trump\u2019s agenda will mesh nicely with these principles. When it inevitably does not, conservatives will find themselves facing a quandary: Fall in line and risk damaging the credibility of conservatism, or push back and risk provoking a thin-skinned and Twitter-addicted president.\n\nWill Congress dare to flout recent history and serve as a principled check on the executive?\n\nFurther complicating things is the fact that Trump dominated \u2014 in the primary and general elections \u2014 those districts represented by Congress\u2019s most conservative members. They once believed they were elected to advance a narrowly ideological agenda, but Trump\u2019s success has given them reason to question that belief. Knowing this, GOP leadership officials are betting that Trump\u2019s popularity among conservative constituents will make their representatives less obstructionist and therefore less influential in the upcoming Congress.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see us sticking together more. I think there is less ability for the Freedom Caucus to do those types of things,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a Washington Post breakfast in late November. \u201cI\u2019m sure those districts Donald Trump probably did the best in. It would be hard for them to stand up, if a President Trump is asking for this fundamental change, and they\u2019re saying no.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan called McCarthy\u2019s comments \u201claughable.\u201d Yet he has reason for concern. He knows that only three Freedom Caucus members \u2014 Steve Pearce of New Mexico, Trent Franks of Arizona, and Ted Poe of Texas \u2014 have been around long enough to defy a Republican president. And he knows that some of his group\u2019s most reliably bold members won\u2019t be there in the next Congress.\n\nMulvaney is one of them. In June, he conceded there had been surprisingly little conservative opposition to Trump but promised that Freedom Caucus members would hold the Republican nominee to the same standard as they did to Obama \u2014 particularly on the issue of executive power. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about Donald Trump shredding the Constitution, because I know the people who stand in the House between him and the Constitution,\u201d Mulvaney told me at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting against an imperial presidency for five and a half years. Every time we go to the floor and push back against an overreaching president, we get accused of being partisan at best and racist at worst. When we do it against a Republican president, maybe people will see that it was a principled objection in the first place. So we actually welcome that opportunity. It might actually be fun, being a strict-constitutionalist congressman doing battle with a non-strict-constitutionalist Republican president.\u201d\n\nInstead, he\u2019s joining Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMulvaney was recently named director of the Office of Management and Budget, the powerful agency that supervises and coordinates the government\u2019s financial planning. The week before he was chosen, I asked Mulvaney whether he stood by his promises about congressional Republicans\u2019 holding Trump accountable. He declined to comment, because he was waiting to hear back from New York about the OMB post.\n\nFreedom Caucus members \u2014 and Ryan, notably \u2014 issued ecstatic statements lauding Mulvaney\u2019s selection as a sign of Trump\u2019s commitment to fiscal responsibility. That\u2019s one way of looking at it. Another way is this: Trump just sidelined one of the House\u2019s most outspoken conservatives, someone who repeatedly stood up to Republican leadership, thereby weakening potential intra-party resistance to his administration\u2019s initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese dueling outlooks frame an essential and defining question for Republicans entering the era of Trump: With unified control of government and a president who bullied his way into the White House, will Congress dare to flout recent history and serve as a principled check on the executive?\n\n* * *\n\nThere is some reason to believe that conservatives will be intellectually consistent in their intra-party oppositions. After all, thanks to a bare 52-seat Senate majority, some combination of Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, Ben Sasse, and Marco Rubio can easily derail GOP-only legislation. In the House, the Freedom Caucus\u2019s core membership has repeatedly shown an appetite for internecine rumbling. And even within the administration, prominent conservatives \u2014 Mulvaney at OMB, Tom Price at Health and Human Services \u2014 could push back on the president if he strays from small-government doctrine.\n\nBut one-party rule has a way of silencing dissent, especially if the president has sustained popularity with the base. It\u2019s hardly a stretch to imagine Trump spending his first year amassing voter goodwill by passing robust tax cuts and approving a massive, shovel-ready infrastructure package, only to steadily grow the size of government (and the power of the executive) while daring congressional Republicans to stop him. Everyone knows George W. Bush doubled the national debt; not everyone recalls that his first OMB director was Mitch Daniels, perhaps the most revered fiscal hawk of his generation.\n\nThe speaker of the House is particularly sensitive to this reality. Before he was a conservative darling with unflinching budget proposals, Ryan was a rank-and-file House Republican who voted for No Child Left Behind, Medicare Part D, and the bank bailouts. Many conservatives \u2014 including Vice President\u2013elect Mike Pence \u2014 believe it was these betrayals of principle, as much as the Affordable Care Act or anything Obama pursued, that inspired the Tea Party\u2019s ascent in 2010. Pence, who voted against all three of the aforementioned bills, told me before Election Day that the Republican party \u201clost its way\u201d under Bush and ignited the anti-establishment insurgency that would eventually result in Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nBut Pence himself is now a subordinate to Trump; his charge is to influence policymaking from within, not lead the opposition from without. And Ryan \u2014 who has no track record of opposing his party\u2019s leadership, and whose speakership was likely spared by Trump \u2014 isn\u2019t exactly positioned to challenge the president-elect, either. Trump compared Ryan to \u201ca fine wine\u201d during a recent joint appearance in Wisconsin, but he had a warning for the speaker as well: \u201cEvery day goes by, I get to appreciate his genius more and more,\u201d Trump said of Ryan. \u201cNow, if he ever goes against me, I\u2019m not going to say that, okay?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe morning after Election Day, when I asked Ryan during a press conference about his branch\u2019s role in checking the executive \u2014 and avoiding the mistakes of the GOP under Bush \u2014 he was circumspect in his reply. \u201cI think the mistakes of the Republican government [were] that we didn\u2019t do the right thing at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the mistake that we made in the past is we didn\u2019t seize the opportunity when it presented itself. The opportunity is now here.\u201d\n\nWhen Ryan talks about doing \u201cthe right thing,\u201d he\u2019s voicing regret that Republicans refused to act boldly \u2014 by reforming Social Security, for instance \u2014 when they controlled government. But he\u2019s also touching on something more foundational. \u201cThe opportunity\u201d Ryan says that Republicans squandered under Bush was to prove that their party was committed to principles of limited government. Ryan now sees the chance to right both wrongs \u2014 to accomplish significant things, and accomplish them in a conservative way \u2014 with a unified government.\n\nBut Ryan \u2014 and Pence, for that matter \u2014 will be focused more on the former goal than on the latter. That is not to say they\u2019ll champion progressive proposals, but rather that the responsibility of pushing hard for the most conservative version of any undertaking will fall to Congress, and in most cases the House. It\u2019s true that the GOP has just a narrow majority in the Senate, and that some Republican senators already have shown a willingness to tangle with Trump. (Cruz, who built his brand as an intra-party agitator, is expected to tread carefully owing to his complex history with Trump as well as his looming Senate reelection campaign.) But there are also numerous red- and purple-state Democrats eager to work with the new administration ahead of their own tough reelections in 2018, thus providing cushion for maneuvering in an upper chamber that was less ideological to begin with.\n\nOne-party rule has a way of silencing dissent, especially if the president has sustained popularity with the base.\n\nIt\u2019s a different story in the House, where Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi can often whip her caucus en masse against GOP measures. Republicans will control 241 seats in the next Congress (assuming the party keeps a handful of special-election seats) and 218 are needed to approve legislation, meaning Ryan can lose only 23 GOP votes. The Freedom Caucus will number roughly 40, which ensures two things: It will control the margin needed to pass Republican-only bills, and it will be positioned as the first and last line of defense against Trump.\n\nSome Freedom Caucus members \u2014 Jordan, Justin Amash of Michigan, Mark Sanford of South Carolina \u2014 are considered immovable. But many of the group\u2019s rank-and-file members are relatively new to Congress and have been tag-alongs, rather than instigators, in the fights against GOP leadership. They represent heavily pro-Trump districts and might have no appetite for conflict. \u201cSome of these guys still get nervous when they get called to the speaker\u2019s office,\u201d one Freedom Caucus member tells me. \u201cWhat happens when Trump calls them to the Oval?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuddying the picture further is the fact that some of the House\u2019s most stalwart conservatives have just left Congress or soon will. Mulvaney, of course, is headed to OMB. Scott Garrett, a Freedom Caucus board member, lost a hard-fought reelection battle in his New Jersey district. Louisiana\u2019s John Fleming, also a board member, gave up his House seat to run unsuccessfully for the Senate. Raul Labrador, another board member, has been one of the most outspoken critics of GOP leadership \u2014 but colleagues say he\u2019s decided to run for governor of Idaho, a decision that might remove him from the front lines of some intra-party fights, and would remove him from the House altogether in 2018. Tim Huelskamp, who has voted as often against Republican legislation as anyone, lost his primary in Kansas\u2019s first district. Matt Salmon, a highly respected conservative who was considered a universally acceptable successor to Jordan as Freedom Caucus chairman, retired this year.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Mark Meadows, the group\u2019s incoming chairman, who arrived with the second wave of tea-partiers in 2012. The small-businessman from North Carolina stayed mostly behind the scenes until July 2015, when, against the wishes of some Freedom Caucus colleagues, he filed an obscure procedural motion aimed at ousting Boehner. It unexpectedly worked, and Meadows gained something of a cult following in the conservative base, which he has expertly parlayed into a more prominent role in the conservative movement.\n\nThe question now is how aggressively Meadows will position the group to Trump\u2019s right. Several members have raised concerns about Meadows\u2019s perceived coziness with the president-elect \u2014 they hit it off while traveling together in North Carolina during the campaign \u2014 and his transition team, specifically chief strategist Stephen Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, with whom Meadows talks frequently. There was a heated internal exchange, members say, on November 30 when Breitbart.com published a story with the headline \u201dExclusive \u2014 Rep. Mark Meadows: House Conservatives Ready on Day One to Help Donald Trump.\u201d Meadows isn\u2019t the only one being scrutinized. Dave Brat, the former economics professor who defeated Eric Cantor in 2014, was recently elected to the Freedom Caucus board for the 115th Congress. His nickname in the group: \u201cBratbart,\u201d for his love of the far-right website and determination to stay in its good graces.\n\nThat said, while the Freedom Caucus\u2019s fondness for Trump is somewhat surprising, Meadows\u2019s association with Bannon is smart and strategic. House conservatives are increasingly worried that Ryan\u2019s close personal relationship with Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, will result in backroom deals that diminish their ability to influence legislation. This seemed to be foreshadowed by a December incident in which Jordan informed Ryan of his intention to proceed with an effort to impeach the IRS Commissioner. Ryan\u2019s office objected, and when Jordan ignored them, sources say the Freedom Caucus chairman got a sudden call from Priebus \u2014 whose phone number Jordan didn\u2019t recognize \u2014 asking him to please hold back. Jordan pushed ahead, all the more motivated after Ryan\u2019s apparent decision to enlist Priebus to stop him. (Jordan\u2019s resolution was rejected on the House floor and referred back to committee.)\n\nIf there\u2019s a tug-of-war in the White House for influence over Trump and his agenda \u2014 pitting Priebus the establishment insider against Bannon the populist outsider \u2014 it makes sense that Ryan and the congressional leadership are partnering with Priebus while Meadows and Freedom Caucus members are allying themselves with Bannon. But these tensions may not manifest anytime soon. Meadows believes that Trump\u2019s agenda out of the gate is likely to unify Republicans and suppress any internal conflicts. \u201cIn the first 200 days, we\u2019ve got enough where we agree on that I don\u2019t see a lot of areas for battles with the administration,\u201d he tells me.\n\nHouse conservatives are increasingly worried that Ryan\u2019s close personal relationship with Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, will result in backroom deals that diminish their ability to influence legislation.\n\nMeadows is probably right that Republicans won\u2019t fight a civil war at the dawn of Trump\u2019s administration, but that doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some fascinating ideological modulation to monitor. Consider Trump\u2019s stated intention to seek a $1 trillion dollar infrastructure package soon after taking office. At a conservative forum one week after the election, Labrador told reporters that any such bill \u201chas to be paid for\u201d with spending cuts or revenues from elsewhere, \u201cand if Trump doesn\u2019t find a way to pay for it, the majority of us, if not all of us, are going to vote against it.\u201d Otherwise, conservatives reasoned, it would be no different than the Obama stimulus package they once railed against. But their thinking has shifted in the weeks since. According to several members, there has been informal talk of accepting a bill that\u2019s only 50 percent paid for, with the rest of the borrowing being offset down the road by \u201ceconomic growth.\u201d It\u2019s an arrangement Republicans would never have endorsed under a President Hillary Clinton, and a slippery slope to go down with Trump.\n\nAnother example is the repeal of Obamacare. Pro-life leaders met quietly in Washington the week after Election Day and plotted to pressure Republican leaders to defund Planned Parenthood in the process of repealing the outgoing president\u2019s signature health-care law early next year, and the idea has conservatives\u2019 support. \u201cThis will be a good test: Can we really defund Planned Parenthood?\u201d Jordan tells me. \u201cWe have to. I mean, come on. . . . It had better happen.\u201d But congressional leaders, and Trump, who sang the group\u2019s praises during the campaign, might not want that particular fight at that particular time. If they don\u2019t, expect a showdown between social conservatives and the president they helped elect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn these instances and potentially many more \u2014 his refusal to touch entitlement programs, his desire to borrow historic amounts without regard for the national debt \u2014 traditional conservatives might be abruptly reminded that Trump is not one of them. Their decision, either to follow his lead or push back in defense of the principles that have defined modern conservatism, will go a long way toward determining whether Trump is successful in remaking the party in his image.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the six weeks since Trump\u2019s triumph, many conservatives have shooed away these questions, arguing that nobody knows how he will govern until he actually takes office on January 20. They are understandably reluctant to preemptively criticize an incoming president who\u2019s popular with their constituents back home \u2014 and who could jeopardize their political careers and livelihoods with a single retaliatory tweet. Indeed, some normally talkative lawmakers agreed to discuss the upcoming Congress only if they were not quoted.\n\nIt\u2019s this culture of intimidation that helps to explain why conservatives weren\u2019t publicly irate with the incoming administration for offering Carrier $7 million in tax breaks and incentives to keep roughly 1,000 jobs in Pence\u2019s home state of Indiana.\n\nThe Carrier deal is a textbook example of the \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d conservatives have fought against \u2014 as Sarah Palin pointed out \u2014 and part of a propaganda campaign in which Trump is attempting to demonstrate before taking office that his election has already helped American workers. Yet the response from Republican leaders, including Ryan, who for years has warned that the government should not pick winners and losers, was to celebrate the deal. Most conservatives kept quiet, too, one notable exception being Amash, a libertarian-leaning Michigan Republican with a fierce independent streak. \u201cMore corporate welfare and cronyism,\u201d Amash tweeted in response to the Carrier news. \u201cEqual protection is denied when one company receives favors at the expense of everyone else in Indiana.\u201d\n\nMeadows has a different take. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any federal benefit that [Trump] promised them other than tax reform and regulatory reform,\u201d he tells me. \u201cEveryone wants to talk about crony capitalism, but he didn\u2019t encourage them to do anything that states aren\u2019t already doing anyway.\u201d\n\nThis reaction is telling. Some Republicans want to reserve any alarm-sounding for when Trump clearly oversteps a line \u2014 executive overreach will be closely monitored after the GOP allowed Bush to drastically expand the power of the presidency \u2014 but avoid disputes over every little perceived breach of conservative orthodoxy. To them, the Carrier deal seems like small potatoes; to others, however, it\u2019s the possible foreshadowing of a party swapping out free-market principles for a nationalistic approach to economics.\n\nIn the era of Trump, the very definition of conservatism seems up for grabs.\n\nDavid McIntosh, the Club for Growth president and former Indiana congressman who has been Pence\u2019s friend for two decades, says the Carrier deal set \u201ca terrible precedent\u201d and that he was \u201csurprised and disappointed to hear [Pence] say that the marketplace didn\u2019t work in this case.\u201d But McIntosh nevertheless continues to believe Pence is conservatives\u2019 best hope of positively influencing Trump. \u201cWhat I saw him do during the campaign was kind of reinterpret \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 into a list of conservative initiatives,\u201d McIntosh says. \u201cThe Carrier thing was disappointing because he didn\u2019t do that, and it kind of seemed like they were giving up on the free market and talking about tariffs instead.\u201d\n\nMcIntosh hopes Carrier is a \u201cone-off thing,\u201d but what if it\u2019s not? Ten days after the election, Bannon put the party on notice in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build an entirely new political movement,\u201d he boasted. \u201cThe conservatives are going to go crazy. I\u2019m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it\u2019s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We\u2019re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution \u2014 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.\u201d\n\nBannon is correct that traditional conservatives wouldn\u2019t support the agenda he describes. But in the era of Trump, the very definition of conservatism seems up for grabs. \u201cPopulism\u201d has become the new buzzword on the right; Jordan, in our interview, made repeated references to \u201cpopulist-conservative policy,\u201d advocating the suddenly chic notion of a marriage between Trump\u2019s everyman appeal and the tea party\u2019s ideological purity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, that such a merger is even possible. \u201dPopulism as an ideology is not ideological. Populism basically says, \u2018There\u2019s a parade coming down the street and I\u2019d better get out there because I\u2019m their leader,\u2019\u201d says Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nFor instance, Trump\u2019s threat to penalize companies that ship jobs overseas might excite a blue-collar worker in rural, red America, but the idea is likely to be fundamentally incompatible with the ideology preached by the politician who represents that worker\u2019s district. The politician in question might agonize over the violation of conservative orthodoxy, Brooks says, but when regular people are forced to choose between their livelihoods and a set of abstract principles, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\n\nConservatives must now be careful not to oppose their party on principles that are no longer relevant or advantageous to the people they represent.\n\n\u201cAmericans are not very ideological. Americans have some moral principles, which is great, but they\u2019re really practical,\u201d Brooks tells me. The idea of a \u201cpopulist-conservative\u201d hybrid, then, might afford politicians and parties a flexibility they previously lacked to experiment with policies and expand the party\u2019s philosophical boundaries free from accusations of apostasy. \u201cI think that what people are saying is not a logical fallacy,\u201d Brooks adds. \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is that the ideas and actions of Donald Trump [are] going to wind up affecting how American conservatism understands itself, because the actions he takes that work will ultimately be adopted by the conservative playbook.\u201d\n\nTo that point: If Pence, who was once arguably the most ideological Republican in Congress, can be persuaded by Trump to stop supporting multinational trade deals and offer tax breaks to Carrier, it\u2019s not hard to imagine Freedom Caucus members adapting to a new and different mandate from their constituents in the era of Trump.\n\nIndeed, conservatives must now be careful not to oppose their party on principles that are no longer relevant or advantageous to the people they represent. Huelskamp\u2019s \u201cBig First\u201d district in Kansas is deeply conservative, but it also boasts one of the nation\u2019s premier farming constituencies. So when he voted against the Farm Bill in 2013 \u2014 after he\u2019d already been kicked off the Agriculture Committee for other protest votes \u2014 he made himself uniquely vulnerable to a primary challenge from a more moderate Republican. It was previously unimaginable that a tea-party lawmaker could lose to someone running to their left in a conservative district. But that\u2019s just what happened: Roger Marshall, a physician, promised to make the government more responsive to the agricultural interests of the district \u2014 a far cry from the message of getting government out of the way, period \u2014 and knocked off Huelskamp by 13 points.\n\nThe episode put a scare into conservatives, who saw establishment Republicans emboldened after claiming their first Freedom Caucus scalp and wondered who would be targeted next. This is part of Jordan\u2019s reasoning for stepping down as the group\u2019s chairman, according to sources familiar with his thinking. Most Freedom Caucus members have little cash in their campaign accounts and are therefore susceptible to primary challenges from better-financed, establishment-backed candidates. Jordan will now be devoting time and energy to growing the House Freedom Fund, his leadership PAC, with the aim of defending those members. Jordan, sources say, has even consulted Chris Wilson, the Republican data guru who ran the Cruz presidential campaign\u2019s analytics outfit, about working on behalf of the group and its most vulnerable members.\n\nJordan\u2019s efforts might take on added urgency with Trump in the White House. Though conservatives believe the president-elect to be an ally, they also recognize his fickle nature, which has been a source of frequent internal conversations. Even if they support Trump nine times of ten, voting against him once could trigger a tweetstorm or the threat of a visit to their district. It\u2019s a chilling thought for members who know that the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the House GOP leadership already want them gone.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency might signal heightened influence for conservatives; it could also trigger an establishment-orchestrated purge of members who dare to defy his priorities.\n\n\u201cMost of these members have every incentive to be cooperative. There\u2019s a strong pro-Trump vote in their districts. They\u2019re naturally inclined to be cooperative with the president under these circumstances,\u201d says Matthew Spalding, a longtime Heritage Foundation official who runs Hillsdale College\u2019s Kirby Center campus in Washington. \u201cThe president-elect will have every opportunity to challenge them. And if they\u2019re oppositional, in the midterms he could run his own candidates.\u201d\n\n#related#There\u2019s no way yet of knowing how aggressively, if at all, Trump will steer the party away from traditional conservative orthodoxy \u2014 or how aggressively Republicans in his administration and in Congress will fight him. But if there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from the last time the GOP controlled all of government, it\u2019s that there are lasting consequences to abandoning the party\u2019s foundational values.\n\n\u201cIf we as conservatives lose our bearings, if we go the wrong direction \u2014 we\u2019ve seen that in the past, we saw Republicans stray away in the \u201970s, we saw Republicans stray away from the core principles during the Bush 43 presidency \u2014 if we stray away, then that will provide the particle that allows the Democratic party to come back,\u201d Texas congressman Bill Flores, the outgoing chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said during a recent forum at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThen again, if congressional Republicans are as deferential to Donald Trump as they were to George W. Bush, conservatives shouldn\u2019t be concerned about the 45th president straying from the party\u2019s core principles. They should worry that he\u2019ll redefine those principles altogether.",
