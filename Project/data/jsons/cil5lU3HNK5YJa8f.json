    "content": "Sadly , America \u2019 s race relations are worse off under President Barack Obama , our first black president , says a passionate black graduate student who voted for him twice .\nShe blames Obama \u2019 s eight years of divisive governance spawning dangerous narratives of hate , not President-elect Donald Trump who is wrongly labeled by elites as divisive , even before taking office . Antonia Okafor rose to prominence because of her recent NRA ad , \u201c I Didn \u2019 t Listen . \u201d\nIn this exclusive video interview for \u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation , she says she voted for Obama believing the false and dominant narrative being peddled through the black community that \u201c just because he looks like me , he is best for me. \u201d She then realized that \u201c his policies are harming me , not helping me. \u201d Now , she votes for policies , not the person . She casts herself as a black conservative and is optimistic about Trump \u2019 s policies .\nThe Trump victory , she thinks , was a broad cross-section of Americans of all races saying \u201c enough \u201d to the false narratives and overused labels being thrown at political opponents . As for the labels being thrown at GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions , Trump \u2019 s nominee for attorney general , Okafor says they only remind her of the disturbing and ridiculous labels given to her , like \u201c racist , misogynist and sexist \u201d or \u201c deplorable \u201d for voting for Trump .\nCountering feminists , too , Okafor has worked with Students for Concealed Carry and been a passionate leader for more concealed carry policies on campuses as a means of personal empowerment , especially for young women . Besides being a frequent guest on Tomi Lahren \u2019 s popular show at The Blaze , she is now a journalist with the Independent Journal Review where her focus is on liberal bias on college campuses .\nOkafor is \u201c sad and disappointed \u201d with Obama \u2019 s failures as the first black president . Instead of being a peacemaker , he gave license to a \u201c dangerous narrative \u201d that hateful people can do anything to whites because of their skin color . She hears others believing and promoting this disturbing belief , a belief reflected in the \u201c heartbreaking \u201d Chicago Facebook live video of the four blacks who tortured a white special needs boy .\nInstead of unifying America , Obama has \u201c agitated \u201d to the point where others call for \u201c race wars \u201d because of the power and control progressives can wield if certain voices , facts and logic can be marginalized , she explains .\nOkafor has lost many friends for shifting her worldview , and was even been surrounded by a hostile , threatening Black Lives Matter mob in Austin , Texas , that chanted \u201c traitor \u201d at her . The pushback she receives only seems to strengthen her resolve to think , use facts and logic and help others . She is optimistic that with one-on-one conversations , more lives and worldviews can be changed , as opposed to the \u201c shout-fest \u201d occurring on social media .\nOkafor knows there are many who would try to keep voices like hers silenced or marginalized because she has the capacity to credibly offer a differing point of view from the elite narratives being driven through the media .
