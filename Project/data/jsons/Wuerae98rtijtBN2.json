    "content": "The House of Representatives impeached Donald Trump Wednesday evening , approving two articles of impeachment : one alleging abuse of power , and the other alleging obstruction of Congress .\nBoth articles are based on the Ukraine scandal , meaning the party decided not to introduce any articles of impeachment solely based on the Mueller report , as some had pushed for . You can read the full articles of impeachment at this link .\nArticles of impeachment are essentially the \u201c charges \u201d against the president that the House of Representatives has now approved . Their approval means the Senate will next hold a trial to determine whether to remove Trump from office .\nArticle I , abuse of power , addresses Trump \u2019 s general underlying conduct in the Ukraine scandal . It alleges that Trump abused his power by trying to pressure Ukraine \u2019 s government into announcing an investigation into the Bidens by withholding both a White House meeting and military aid .\nArticle II , obstruction of Congress , is about how Trump responded to Democrats \u2019 impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine scandal . It alleges that Trump obstructed the probe by urging witnesses not to cooperate and government agencies not to comply with subpoenas .\nArticle I , \u201c Abuse of Power , \u201d focuses on the underlying facts of the Ukraine scandal . It asserts that Trump :\n\u201c Corruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations \u201d into his political rival Joe Biden , and into \u201c a discredited theory \u201d that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election\nAttempted to condition two \u201c official acts \u201d on this announcement \u2014 a White House meeting with Ukraine \u2019 s president , and the release of $ 391 million of blocked military aid for Ukraine\nThe article adds that , once Trump was \u201c faced with the public revelation of his actions , \u201d he released the aid \u2014 but that he \u201c persisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to undertake investigations for his personal political benefit . \u201d\nThis , Article I continues , is abusing the powers of the presidency \u201c by ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit. \u201d The article also asserts that Trump \u201c betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections . \u201d\nArticle II , \u201c Obstruction of Congress , \u201d states that President Trump \u201c has directed the unprecedented , categorical , and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant to its \u2018 sole Power of Impeachment . \u2019 \u201d\nDirected the White House to defy a subpoena for documents\nDirected other executive branch agencies , such as the State Department and Defense Department , to defy subpoenas\nDirected current and former executive branch officials to refuse subpoenas for their testimony .\n\u201c This abuse of office served to cover up the President \u2019 s own repeated misconduct and to seize and control the power of impeachment , \u201d Article II reads . Therefore , both articles conclude , Trump should be removed from office and barred from holding any future office .\nThe number of articles doesn \u2019 t matter all that much \u2014 it only takes conviction on one to remove a president \u2014 but the Democrats \u2019 decision to go with just two puts this on the lower end of historical presidential impeachments .\nFor President Andrew Johnson in 1868 , the full House approved a whopping 11 articles of impeachment . Most were based on Johnson \u2019 s violation of a new law blocking him from firing a Cabinet secretary without Senate approval , though one actually focused on mean speeches Johnson gave disparaging Congress . ( Johnson ended up being acquitted by a single vote in the Senate . )\nFor President Richard Nixon in 1974 , the Judiciary Committee approved three articles related to the Watergate scandal : one alleging obstruction of justice , one alleging abuse of power , and one alleging contempt of Congress . The committee rejected two other articles : one on usurping the powers of Congress , and one accusing Nixon of tax fraud . ( Nixon then resigned before the full House could vote to impeach him . )\nFinally , for President Bill Clinton in 1998 , the Judiciary Committee approved four articles related to the Lewinsky scandal . Two , a perjury count and an obstruction of justice count , were then approved by the full House . The two other articles , another perjury count and an abuse of office count , were voted down by the full house . ( Clinton was acquitted on both counts in the Senate . )\nThe major decision that Democrats made here was one of omission \u2014 that is , they did not introduce an article of impeachment based on special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s findings , as many in the party have long pushed for .\nMueller collected evidence on what sure looks like a pattern of obstruction of justice , exploring matters such as Trump \u2019 s attempt to get then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn ( which failed ) ; Trump \u2019 s attempts to get then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal from oversight over the Russia probe ( which failed ) ; Trump \u2019 s firing of Comey ; Trump \u2019 s order to White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller ( which failed ) ; and Trump and his legal team \u2019 s urging key figures ( like former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort ) not to flip while attacking those who did flip ( like former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen ) .\nThe tricky part is that Mueller declined to outright say whether any of this was obstruction of justice \u2014 in part , he said , because Justice Department guidelines state he shouldn \u2019 t indict a sitting president . This , he said , was Congress \u2019 s job .\nBut in practice , that decision \u2014 combined with Mueller \u2019 s failure to establish any conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to interfere with an election \u2014 left the special counsel \u2019 s findings a political muddle .\nSo while more liberal Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee argued all summer that this was clear obstruction of justice that Trump needed to be held accountable for , moderates in the party were hesitant \u2014 and Speaker Nancy Pelosi became a firm opponent of impeachment based on Mueller \u2019 s findings . Still , pressure from the base for impeachment continued to rise each month .\nBut it was the Ukraine scandal that truly changed the political situation , by providing Democrats new material about more recent behavior by Trump . It drove Pelosi and nearly all the moderates to support an impeachment inquiry .

It alleges that Trump obstructed the probe by urging witnesses not to cooperate and government agencies not to comply with subpoenas.\n\nWhat the articles of impeachment say\n\nArticle I, \u201cAbuse of Power,\u201d focuses on the underlying facts of the Ukraine scandal. It asserts that Trump:\n\n\u201cCorruptly solicited the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations\u201d into his political rival Joe Biden, and into \u201ca discredited theory\u201d that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election\n\nAttempted to condition two \u201cofficial acts\u201d on this announcement \u2014 a White House meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president, and the release of $391 million of blocked military aid for Ukraine\n\nThe article adds that, once Trump was \u201cfaced with the public revelation of his actions,\u201d he released the aid \u2014 but that he \u201cpersisted in openly and corruptly urging and soliciting Ukraine to undertake investigations for his personal political benefit.\u201d\n\nThis, Article I continues, is abusing the powers of the presidency \u201cby ignoring and injuring national security and other vital national interests to obtain an improper personal political benefit.\u201d The article also asserts that Trump \u201cbetrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.\u201d\n\nArticle II, \u201cObstruction of Congress,\u201d states that President Trump \u201chas directed the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant to its \u2018sole Power of Impeachment.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the article goes on, Trump:\n\nDirected the White House to defy a subpoena for documents\n\nDirected other executive branch agencies, such as the State Department and Defense Department, to defy subpoenas\n\nDirected current and former executive branch officials to refuse subpoenas for their testimony.\n\n\u201cThis abuse of office served to cover up the President\u2019s own repeated misconduct and to seize and control the power of impeachment,\u201d Article II reads. Therefore, both articles conclude, Trump should be removed from office and barred from holding any future office.\n\nHow this compares to past impeachments\n\nThe number of articles doesn\u2019t matter all that much \u2014 it only takes conviction on one to remove a president \u2014 but the Democrats\u2019 decision to go with just two puts this on the lower end of historical presidential impeachments.\n\nFor President Andrew Johnson in 1868, the full House approved a whopping 11 articles of impeachment. Most were based on Johnson\u2019s violation of a new law blocking him from firing a Cabinet secretary without Senate approval, though one actually focused on mean speeches Johnson gave disparaging Congress.

Two, a perjury count and an obstruction of justice count, were then approved by the full House. The two other articles, another perjury count and an abuse of office count, were voted down by the full house. (Clinton was acquitted on both counts in the Senate.)\n\nWhy Democrats didn\u2019t go broader\n\nThe major decision that Democrats made here was one of omission \u2014 that is, they did not introduce an article of impeachment based on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings, as many in the party have long pushed for.\n\nMueller collected evidence on what sure looks like a pattern of obstruction of justice, exploring matters such as Trump\u2019s attempt to get then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn (which failed); Trump\u2019s attempts to get then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal from oversight over the Russia probe (which failed); Trump\u2019s firing of Comey; Trump\u2019s order to White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller (which failed); and Trump and his legal team\u2019s urging key figures (like former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort) not to flip while attacking those who did flip (like former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen).\n\nThe tricky part is that Mueller declined to outright say whether any of this was obstruction of justice \u2014 in part, he said, because Justice Department guidelines state he shouldn\u2019t indict a sitting president.
