    "content": "Trump Says His Mideast Peace Plan Provides A 'Realistic Two-State Solution '\nPresident Trump says his long-awaited Mideast peace plan unveiled Tuesday is a road map for a `` realistic two-state solution '' that envisions Jerusalem as Israel 's `` undivided capital . ''\nHowever , the plan limits the sovereignty of a future Palestinian state . Israel would be in charge of maintaining security over the state of Palestine , which would be `` fully demilitarized . '' The proposal also allows Israel to declare sovereignty over certain areas of the occupied West Bank , including Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley .\nTrump heralded the plan as a `` historic breakthrough , '' even though the Palestinian leadership , which severed relations with the U.S. administration as it took a series of pro-Israel moves , rejected it before the proposal was formally released .\n`` After 70 years of little progress , this could be the last opportunity they ever have , '' Trump said at a joint briefing at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . `` My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides \u2014 a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel 's security . ''\nThe U.S. plan has been in the making since the earliest days of Trump 's administration , when the president assigned his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner the task of trying to forge the elusive deal .\nTrump lauded his own proposal as far more specific than other peace plans to date . He said it includes a detailed territorial map of the borders showing `` territorial compromises [ Israel ] is willing to make , '' adding that it marks the first time Israel has authorized the release of such information .\nHe also said the U.S. would open a new embassy in `` Eastern Jerusalem '' to the Palestinians .\nThe Trump administration believes that in addition to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state , this plan could lead to a peace agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .\nBut Palestinians were outraged by the proposal . Opposition even appeared to unite longtime Palestinian political rivals the Palestinian Authority and Hamas , which governs the Gaza Strip . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas chaired an emergency meeting with Hamas , and called it a `` new phase of Palestinian dialogue and joint work , '' according to local media .\nTrump has described the plan as the `` deal of the century , '' but Abbas called it the `` smack of the century , '' saying it was an unacceptable attempt to `` liquidate the Palestinian issue . ''\nHamas leader Ismael Haniyeh said in a statement that `` the new plot against Palestine is doomed to failure and Palestine will vanquish the colonizers at the end . ''\nIn announcing the plan alongside Trump , with whom he has close ties , Netanyahu said Tuesday that `` I 've agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan . It 's a great plan for Israel . It 's a great plan for peace . ''\nOn Monday , Trump met separately with Netanyahu and with Benny Gantz , the leader of Israel 's Blue and White political alliance , Netanyahu 's principal political opponent . Gantz also has expressed his approval of the plan .\nTrump said at the time that the Palestinians `` probably wo n't want [ the plan ] initially , '' but `` I think in the end they 're going to want it . ''\n`` So , we 'll see what happens , '' he added . `` Without them , we do n't do a deal . And that 's OK . ''\nAfter Trump ordered the U.S. Embassy moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in December 2017 , the Palestinians largely broke off relations with the White House . The move , however , proved extremely popular with Israelis .\nIn June , the White House released the first half of its peace proposal : a $ 50 billion investment plan billed as a `` new vision '' for the Palestinian territories . The U.S. made the creation of the investment fund contingent upon Palestinian acceptance of the second , political part of the peace plan , released Tuesday .\nSome analysts questioned the merits of the plan . `` While Trump claims a revolutionary approach to the peace process , this plan actually recycles past failed efforts : it places Palestinians on probation while they prove their worthiness of statehood , using conditions that are malleable and ill-defined ; it seeks to induce Palestinian capitulation through economic largesse ; and it removes the onus on Israel to make any concessions until Palestinians declare their full surrender , '' Tareq Baconi , Israel/Palestine analyst for International Crisis Group , said in a statement .\nThe proposal comes at a politically fraught moment for both Trump and Netanyahu . Trump is currently on trial in the Senate after he was impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress . Netanyahu was formally indicted Tuesday on criminal corruption charges .\nIsrael 's prime minister `` is trying to make this major diplomatic decision , even though his government is a temporary government , in part to shore up support for him domestically as someone who can champion Israel in the international arena , '' Natan Sachs of the Center for Middle East Policy at The Brookings Institution tells NPR .\nSachs also notes that when U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon were facing impeachment , they pushed forward with diplomatic efforts in the Middle East .\nThe plan includes proposals on several core issues that have been major obstacles to progress in previous attempts to forge a comprehensive peace . They include :\nIn April , Netanyahu pledged to annex West Bank settlements in a move aimed at galvanizing support among his right-wing voter base . He later extended that pledge to include annexation of the Jordan Valley , where Palestinians are seeking an independent state . Late last year , U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. does not view settlements as a violation of international law , upending the decades-old U.S. policy that settlements are an obstacle to peace .\nTrump said that no Israelis or Palestinians would be uprooted from their homes . According to the plan , Israeli `` enclaves , '' or settlements , `` located inside contiguous Palestinian territory will become part of the State of Israel and be connected through an effective transportation system . '' A map included in the plan shows 15 such enclaves .\nThe proposal does not stick to Israel 's pre-1967 borders and mutually-agreed-on territory swaps as a starting point for peace negotiations \u2014 which had been U.S. policy under President Barack Obama and which Netanyahu described as indefensible . Instead , the plan `` contemplates a Palestinian state that encompasses territory reasonably comparable in size to the territory of the West Bank and Gaza pre-1967 . ''\nIsrael would annex the entire Jordan Valley , according to the plan . Areas in a future Palestinian state would include parts of the West Bank , connected to the Gaza Strip through a tunnel . It also would include two areas of desert , connected by a thin passage , near Israel 's border with Egypt .\nIsrael would not need to wait until before taking control of areas allocated to it under the plan , U.S . Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in a call to reporters .\nPalestinians have long sought their own state , and much of the international community has supported that desire . In 2002 , then-President George W. Bush called for a Palestinian state as part of his Road Map for Peace . In 2009 , Netanyahu supported a `` demilitarized '' Palestinian state , but by 2015 , he had reversed course , declaring his own policy `` null and void . ''\nOn Tuesday , Trump said he told Abbas in a letter `` that the territory allocated for his new state will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years , '' in which Palestinians may deliberate and study the deal and `` achieve the criteria for statehood . ''\nAccording to the plan , the U.S. and Israel would judge whether Palestinians have met that criteria .\nThose include implementing a governing system that protects certain rights ; establishing `` transparent , independent , and credit-worth financial institutions '' ; ending all programs that `` promote hate '' ; achieving `` civilian and law enforcement control over all of its territory '' ; and demilitarizing its population .\nIt adds that `` sovereignty is an amorphous concept that has evolved over time . ''\nThe limits that the plan would place on Palestinian sovereignty are particularly clear when it comes to security .\n`` Israel will have the overriding security responsibility and control over the entire territory , from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea , '' Friedman told reporters .\nEven so , the plan expresses `` the aspiration that the Palestinians will be responsible for as much of their internal security as possible . ''\nIt also calls for a Palestinian state to be `` fully demilitarized . '' And Israel would have the power to expand its internal security role at any time if it deems the Palestinians are not meeting specific criteria , such as possessing certain weapons .\nBoth Israelis and Palestinians view the disputed city of Jerusalem as their capital . When the U.S. moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018 , it sparked huge protests by Palestinians .\nUnder the Trump administration 's plan , Jerusalem would remain united and would be the capital of Israel . `` We believe that returning to a divided Jerusalem , and in particular having two separate security forces in one of the most sensitive areas on earth , would be a grave mistake , '' the proposal states .\nIt envisions the capital of a Palestinian state in portions of East Jerusalem located beyond existing walls , which Israel says it needs for security , that cut it off from the heart of the city . The plan suggests naming it Al Quds , the Arabic word for Jerusalem .\nJerusalem is home to major holy sites for Muslims , Jews and Christians . The status quo for these sites would be preserved , including Jordan 's role as custodian of the Muslim sites .\nSome 750,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war . More than seven decades later , Israel denies first-generation Palestinian displaced persons and their descendants the right to return to communities from which they had been expelled or had abandoned .\nUnder the plan , `` there shall be no right of return by , or absorption of , any Palestinian refugee into the State of Israel . '' Rather , the refugees would be absorbed into a Palestinian state or integrated into their current host countries . Additionally , up to 50,000 Palestinians may be accepted by Organization of Islamic Cooperation member countries .\nThe proposal also will `` endeavor to raise a fund to provide some compensation to Palestinian refugees , '' without specifying where the money might come from .",
