    "content": "In a February edition of The Briefing , Albert Mohler , theologian and president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary , argued that views on abortion are becoming more polarized , eliminating \u201c middle ground \u201d positions , and that the reason for this is more related to worldview than politics .\nMohler cites a Washington Post article penned by sociologist David Weakliem , in which recent trends on abortion views , gathered from the General Social Survey , are exposed . The results ? \u201c More people think abortion should always be legal . And more people think it should never be legal. \u201d In other words , more and more people are beginning to see abortion as a clear moral issue , not a political issue to be compromised on in a tentative middle ground position .\nWeakliem believes that the moral polarization on abortion is directly related to political polarization , such as Democrats and Republicans in Congress becoming even more opposed to one another over recent decades . But Mohler sees a more basic reason behind the shift away from middle ground positions on abortion .\nAccording to Mohler , abortion is more basic than political ; he refers to it as a \u201c pre-political issue. \u201d Basic worldviews , specifically views on the value of human life , are causing people to either realize that abortion is morally wrong , or to accept it as morally justifiable , argues Mohler . When it comes to human life , a middle ground position is very difficult to support logically , scientifically , or ethically .\nMohler reasons that if one approaches the issue of abortion from a worldview which holds that human life has dignity and worth at every stage , that worldview will tend to lead him or her to become more and more pro-life . Conversely , if the individual \u2019 s worldview holds that human dignity must be earned , or is awarded by society or by the state , he or she may tend to become more and more in favor of abortion .\nWhile Mohler \u2019 s argument favors what he calls a \u201c biblical worldview , \u201d he raises some interesting points that apply not only to the religious , but to secular people as well . While not all pro-lifers identify with religion or the Bible , it is important that the thinking person be aware of his or her own worldview and what it is based on , in order to be better equipped to counter shallow arguments and empty slogans offered by the abortion industry and the politicians it funds .",
