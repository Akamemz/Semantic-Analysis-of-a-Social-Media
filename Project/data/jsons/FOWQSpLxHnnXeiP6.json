    "content": "Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner told CNN 's State of the Union that he does n't think `` there 's a single piece of legislation '' that could have prevented last week 's horrible killing at a Texas high school , adding that a more holistic `` series of actions '' are needed . His other nod to reality was acknowledging , after being prodded by host Jake Tapper , that Democrats failed to act on gun control when they controlled all three elected levers of power in Washington , DC during the Obama years . `` Perhaps , in retrospect , more should have been done , '' he said , amid various evasions and excuses .\nWarner -- who has moved to the left with the rest of his party on guns -- also mentioned background checks and `` military-style assault weapons '' in the interview , each of which is irrelevant to the latest incident . The Texas killer was not legally permitted to own guns , and used more traditional ( i.e. , not an `` assault rifle '' ) firearms during a rampage that left ten people dead . Nevertheless , these facts , which Warner at least partially recognizes , did n't stop one of his colleagues from Connecticut from unleashing his preferred brand of demagogic post-tragedy moral indignation :\nLet \u2019 s call it like it is : the horrifying inaction of Congress , slaughter after slaughter , has become a green light to would-be shooters , who pervert silence into endorsement . \u2014 Chris Murphy ( @ ChrisMurphyCT ) May 18 , 2018\nNational Review 's Charles Cooke explores the implications of Murphy 's tweet , which directly blames Congress ' inaction for effectively endorsing mass killings :\nI \u2019 m left unclear as to what exactly Murphy is talking about . As the New York Times has confirmed , the shooter in Texas used a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver \u2014 and nothing else besides . Moreover , because he was 17-years-old , he was ineligible to purchase a gun either privately or commercially , and thus had no contact with NICS background-check system that Murphy wants to expand . What , precisely , did \u201c Congress \u201d fail to do here ? What perverted signal did it send ? What \u201c endorsement \u201d did it provide ? ... As for the implication that is embedded in Murphy \u2019 s tweet \u2014 namely , that declining to prohibit a given tool is in some way an endorsement of those who would abuse it \u2014 well , I can think of few more destructive ideas in a free country . Was Thurgood Marshall sending a \u201c green light \u201d to the KKK when he voted with the majority in Brandenburg v. Ohio ? Are the many opponents of the Patriot Act offering an \u201c endorsement \u201d to the devotees of Jihad ? Hardly . By suggesting that his opponents disagree with him because they are happy to \u201c allow \u201d massacres , rather than because they think that his proposals ( such as they are ) will be useless , Murphy is seriously damaging our debate over guns , and hurting our political culture .\nCooke 's other major point is that by reheating his typical angry bromides , Murphy is either showing himself to be incapable of critical thinking that distinguishes between guns and acts of violence , based on the facts of each case , or willing to lie about the extent of his gun control intentions : `` Had [ the Texas ] shooting been carried out with an AR-15 , a weapon that Murphy has long wanted to ban , then his reaction would have at least have made internal logical sense . Likewise , if the shooter had bought his firearms privately and skipped the background check that might have thwarted him , Murphy \u2019 s finger-pointing would have been expected . But it wasn \u2019 t , and he didn \u2019 t . And yet Murphy still chastised Congress for not acting , '' Cooke writes .\n`` As far as I can see , there are only two reasonable ways to interpret this behavior : 1 ) That Senator Murphy is a grandstander who does not understand this issue well enough to do anything but shout \u201c do something ! \u201d whenever he sees an abomination on the news ; or 2 ) That Senator Murphy actually does want to ban shotguns and revolvers and everything else besides \u2014 and , by extension , that he wants to repeal the Second Amendment to the Constitution in order to get it done . '' Which is it , Senator ? This is why so many gun rights supporters view the gun control movement 's loudest voices as peddling in ignorance or dishonesty . Take this tweet , for instance , which was shared thousands of times :\nRetweet if you think we can do better \u2014 David Leavitt ( @ David_Leavitt ) May 18 , 2018\nIt is flagrantly wrong to state or imply that Texas does n't require background checks on gun purchases ; all gun sales from licensed gun dealers ( accounting for the overwhelming majority of all sales ) are subject to federal background checks . Furthermore , bullet points four and five simply do not apply to the Texas shooting ( which prompted the tweet ) at all . As we 've noted , the killer did not wield a so-called assault weapon and did not exploit an oversized magazine . He used a shotgun and a revolver .

The strong desire to `` do something '' when teenagers are gunned down in school is completely understandable and human .
