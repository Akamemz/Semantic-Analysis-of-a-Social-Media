He is a former senior correspondent for National Journal and has written about defense , national security and foreign policy issues from Washington , D.C. , for more than two decades .\nTennessee seems an unlikely birthplace for American jihad . Yet long before the five U.S. service members were murdered this past week in Chattanooga , before the Boston Marathon bombers , the Fort Hood shooting or the rise of the Islamic State , it was another troubled teenager from the same state who embarked on a journey of jihad and ended in the first deadly terrorist attack on U.S. soil after 9/11 .\nThe road to jihad began here , where Highway 40 bisects the state Abraham Lincoln once called the \u201c keystone of the southern arch , \u201d heading southwest out of Nashville and Jackson and through endless miles of rich Mississippi delta before riding the steel scaffolding of the Hernando de Soto Bridge across the wide lazy waters .\nMemphis is where the call-and-response songs of the cotton fields and the gospel hymns of the local black churches fused with the blues of the Southern chitlin \u2019 circuit and the twang of country honky-tonks in the bars and music clubs of Beale Street , creating a powerful concoction that changed American music forever . And which , not incidentally , turned Memphis into a tourist mecca that Melvin Bledsoe \u2019 s company , Twin City Tours , is happy to service , transporting you to , among many other places , Stax Records soul music museum and Sam Phillips \u2019 original Sun Studio ( the \u201c birthplace of rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll \u201d ) , the late great B.B . King \u2019 s Blues Club and Jerry Lee Lewis \u2019 Caf\u00e9 and Honky Tonk\u2014and , of course\u2014Graceland .\nA quiet man with chiseled features , slight of stature and with a deliberate diction rounded at the edges by a gentle Southern accent , Melvin Bledsoe has a politeness and direct manner that puts people at ease right away . During summers not so very long ago , Twin City customers were often greeted personally by a proud Melvin and his teenage son Carlos , who since he was 8 years old had been groomed to one day take over the expanding tour business . Carlos attended school at suburban Craigmont High ( \u201c Go Craigmont Chiefs ! \u201d ) , sandwiched between the Redeemed Christian Church of God and the nearby East Side Baptist Church . He played basketball at the high school and met his girlfriend and prom date at a local Baptist church . The Bledsoe family\u2014father , mother , son and daughter\u2014lived nearby in a tidy neighborhood of one- and two-story mostly brick houses , with small yards and , in the case of the Bledsoes , a front porch with rocking chairs and , at one end , a prominently displayed American flag .\nA few years back , Melvin Bledsoe was living a black middle-class , Southern Baptist version of the American dream . Both of his children were college bound , a step up the socioeconomic ladder that Melvin \u2019 s own parents could never afford . The Bledsoes were a tightly knit family clasped in the bosom of a supportive and familiar community . And then a personal crisis opened the door to an utterly unfamiliar intruder , and an idea was planted in a wounded psyche that improbably blossomed into a dark and noxious ideology . And before they even understood the gathering peril , the Bledsoes \u2019 American dream became a nightmare .\nSomehow , in ways that a heartbroken Melvin Bledsoe even now doesn \u2019 t fully comprehend , his beloved son Carlos was transformed into a murderous jihadist , a hate-filled man who called himself Abulhakim Mujahid Mohammed .\nCarlos , to a certain extent , was patient zero in the phenomenon of homegrown , lone-wolf terrorism , a scourge that struck the nation once again this past week , when another young man went on a shooting spree at a recruiting station in Tennessee . The parallels between the life stories of that alleged shooter , Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez , and Carlos Bledsoe \u2019 s are chilling and , perhaps , instructive .\nThe scene of the July 2015 shooting in Chattanooga , Tennessee outside a military recruiting center . | AP Photo\nBoth men grew up in Tennessee and turned toward jihadism at a vulnerable moment in their lives resulting from drug and alcohol use and unrelated arrests . They were both further radicalized after extended stays in the Middle East , the birthplace of a virulent form of fundamentalist Islam . Like Fort Hood shooter Major Nidal Hassan , they both ultimately were influenced by the sermons of the charismatic , radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki , who in 2011 became the first American citizen to be targeted and killed in a U.S. drone strike . Both Mohammed and Abdulazeez chose military recruiting stations in the south as the targets of their violent jihad .\nThat journey toward Islamist radicalization and terrorism has become a well-worn path for homegrown extremists , and their growing numbers threaten to overwhelm U.S. authorities , especially the FBI , who are tracking them in a desperate attempt to thwart their plots and , as they say , \u201c stay to the left of the boom . \u201d\nTo his family , Carlos Bledsoe was the happy-go-lucky jokester . His sister Monica , older by seven years , liked having him around when her friends were over to the house , and they all practically adopted the boy with the high-wattage smile as their own littler brother . Carlos played sports , liked rap music and going to dances , and wore his pants too damn low for Melvin \u2019 s taste , but kids these days , you know ?\nAnd yet there were signs even in high school that Carlos had a hot temper and was susceptible to falling in with the wrong crowd . There were a few fights that ended up in the records of the Shelby County Sheriff \u2019 s Office , including an apparent road rage incident and another that was written up as gang-related , but nothing that led to formal charges . When Carlos set off for Tennessee State University in Nashville to study business in anticipation of taking over Twin City Tours , Melvin and his wife were among countless middle-class parents around the country who breathed a sigh of relief at having steered their child through treacherous teenage shoals and on to college .\nAt left , Carlos Bledsoe appears on June 5 , 2009 with his attorney , Jim Hensley , in a Little Rock , Arkansas courtroom .
