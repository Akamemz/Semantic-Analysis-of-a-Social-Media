    "content": "WikiLeaks founder and chieftain Julian Assange was tossed out of the Ecuadorean embassy in London into the hands of British police last week .\nAssange is wanted on charges of sexual assault in Sweden and charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion in the U.S . He allegedly helped Army private Chelsea ( n\u00e9e Bradley ) Manning illegally obtain a password that led Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents to Assange for WikiLeaks to publish .\nBoth Sweden and the U.S. have requested that Assange be extradited to face justice . It \u2019 s not clear which extradition request will be granted first , but one or the other is certain to be .\nAssange \u2019 s defenders are screaming that he should not face the U.S. charges because he is a journalist and is protected absolutely by the First Amendment . It \u2019 s very important to understand why Assange isn \u2019 t a journalist and why the First Amendment is no bar to his prosecution under federal law .\nThe OED \u2019 s definition of \u201c journalist \u201d is \u201c a person who writes for newspapers or magazines or prepares news to be broadcast on television or radio. \u201d To that we probably have to add people who write about current events for online publications . The key part of the definition is the preparation of news for publication .\nNeither does Assange prepare news for publication nor does WikiLeaks publish news . They are merely a pipeline by which U.S. secrets are published with the intent of damaging our national security .\nThe example of Assange \u2019 s behavior that defines him and WikiLeaks was WikiLeaks \u2019 March 2017 publication of a substantial portion of the computer hacking tools that the CIA uses to conduct espionage abroad . The \u201c stories \u201d were published in WikiLeaks \u2019 \u201c Vault 7. \u201d They weren \u2019 t news stories revealing what the CIA was doing : it was the computer software itself \u2014 the lines of code \u2014 that were being used .\nThe difference there was rather than publish news about the CIA \u2019 s behavior and the targets against which the tools were employed , Assange and WikiLeaks published the actual computer software . Doing so gave every adversary \u2014 nations , terrorist networks , and others \u2014 information which they could use to protect themselves against U.S. espionage .\nWikiLeaks isn \u2019 t a news publication but a cyber bulletin board on which any leaker can have America \u2019 s most closely-guarded secrets published . Assange isn \u2019 t a journalist : he \u2019 s an anti-American activist whose mission in life is to damage the United States . As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said when he was CIA director , WikiLeaks functions as if it were a \u201c non-state hostile intelligence service . \u201d\nThere are journalists who fit the OED \u2019 s definition but act as irresponsibly as WikiLeaks does . Consider the actions of the New York Times and Washington Post in two cases : the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers and the 2006 publication of the CIA \u2019 s \u201c warrantless wiretapping \u201d activity .\nIn the Pentagon Papers case , an employee of the RAND corporation , Daniel Ellsberg , copied and stole a top-secret analysis of American policy in Vietnam . He leaked the analysis to the New York Times which began publishing parts of the leaked papers .\nPrior restraint is the most severe form of censorship . For the first time in history , the government obtained a court order enjoining further publication by the Times . Ellsberg then leaked the study to the Washington Post which began publishing them . The government tried and failed to get a D.C. court to enjoin further publication by the Post .\nThe matter quickly rose to the Supreme Court which held ( by a 6-3 vote ) that prior restraint was unconstitutional . In dismissing the claim that prior restraint was justified by national security concerns , the Court said that , \u201c The word \u2018 security \u2019 is a broad , vague generality whose contours should not be invoked to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment . \u201d\nFlash forward to 2006 . After the 9-11 attacks , the CIA and the NSA \u2014 using their authorities under the new \u201c Patriot Act \u201d and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , began intercepting and monitoring electronic communications of an enormous number of people , some of whom were inside U.S. borders .\nThe program reportedly resulted in the interdiction of several terrorist attacks and generated a wealth of intelligence information about terrorist activities both within the U.S. and abroad . It was disclosed to Congress in classified briefings .\nA year before publication of the matter , a CIA leaker informed the New York Times about the agencies \u2019 actions , and the Times \u2019 reporters , James Risen and Eric Lichtblau , began writing stories about it . Risen began writing a book on the information divulged by the leaker . The Times informed the government that they intended to publish the details of the \u201c warrantless wiretapping \u201d program .\nIn 2005 , meetings were held at the Times \u2019 offices during which top Bush administration officials attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the Times staff to not publish the stories . At that point , then-president George W. Bush invited the Times \u2019 publisher , Arthur Sulzberger , to the Oval Office to make a last plea to not publish the stories . Sulzberger wasn \u2019 t persuaded .\nPresident Bush and his team could do no more . Under the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling in the Pentagon Papers case , they couldn \u2019 t use the courts to restrain publication . They had to rely on the Times \u2019 judgment and patriotism . Both were not sufficient to restrain the reporters , editors , and publisher of the Times .\nOn December 16 , 2005 the Times began publishing its stores on the CIA/NSA program . Risen \u2019 s book State of War was released on the same day giving great detail about the program .\nThe Times , Risen , and Lichtblau acted irresponsibly and despicably . Their actions caused terrorists to change the means by which they communicated . That probably cost American and allied lives and delayed our ability to find Osama bin Laden .\nThe courts remain divided on the constitutionality of the CIA/NSA program . The CIA leaker , Jeffrey Sterling , was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison .\nThe difference between what the Times did and what Assange did is not only the fact that the Times is a newspaper and its reporters are journalists . The two differences are reason why one is protected by the First Amendment and the other isn \u2019 t .\nFirst , the Times and its reporters were intentionally exposing top-secret information by writing up and publishing the government \u2019 s actions .

Assange advised Snowden to travel to Russia instead of South America in order to escape U.S. extradition . Assange , who has had a cozy relationship with Russia and Russian intelligence agencies for a long time , reportedly bought Snowden \u2019 s airline ticket to Russia .\nAssange \u2019 s and WikiLeaks \u2019 are the actions of hostile intelligence agents , not of journalists .
