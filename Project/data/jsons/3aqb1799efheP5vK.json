    "content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that Washington will agree to lift sanctions on North Korea if the country agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear weapons program , a move that would create economic prosperity that `` will rival '' South Korea .\nSpeaking on several Sunday morning talk shows , Pompeo said the United States would not be willing to invest taxpayer dollars to help the country , but was willing to `` lift sanctions '' to pave the way for private American investment in North Korea \u2019 s energy , agriculture , and infrastructure sectors .\nPompeo 's comments come ahead of a planned June 12 meeting in Singapore between North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump , the first such meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader .\n\u201c What Chairman Kim will get from America is our finest \u2013 our entrepreneurs , our risk takers , our capital providers ... They will get private capital that comes in . North Korea is desperately in need of energy ... for their people . They are in great need of agricultural equipment and technology , \u201d he said on CBS \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d\n\u201c We can create conditions for real economic prosperity for the North Korean people that will rival that of the South , \u201d he added . \u201c That is our expectation . It won \u2019 t be U.S. taxpayers . \u201d\nNorth Korean state media reported over the weekend that the country has scheduled the dismantlement of its nuclear bomb site for later in May .\nPompeo welcomed the news of the plans when asked about it on Sunday .\n`` Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk on the American people that is destroyed , eliminated , dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world , '' he said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''\nNorth Korea said Saturday that it will dismantle its nuclear test site in less than two weeks , in a dramatic event that would set up leader Kim 's summit with Trump next month . Trump welcomed the `` gracious gesture . ''\nIn a statement carried by state media , North Korea 's Foreign Ministry said all of the tunnels at the country 's northeastern testing ground will be destroyed by explosion , and observation and research facilities and ground-based guard units will also be removed .\nKim had already revealed plans to shut the test site by the end of May during his summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last month . Analysts say that while the closure of the site is important , it does n't represent a material step toward full denuclearization .\n`` A ceremony for dismantling the nuclear test ground is now scheduled between May 23 and 25 , '' depending on weather , the Foreign Ministry 's statement said , adding that journalists from the United States , South Korea , China , Russia and Britain will be invited to witness the dismantling .\nThe ministry said the North will continue to `` promote close contacts and dialogue with the neighboring countries and the international society so as to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and over the globe . ''\nTrump , in a tweet Saturday , thanked North Korea for its plan to dismantle the nuclear test site , calling it `` a very smart and gracious gesture !

However , there are lingering doubts about whether Kim would ever agree to fully relinquish the weapons he probably views as his only guarantee of survival .\nDuring their meeting at a border truce village , Moon and Kim vaguely promised to work toward the `` complete denuclearization '' of the Korean Peninsula , but made no references to verification or timetables .\nNorth Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of `` denuclearization '' that bears no resemblance to the American definition .

These refer to experiments involving a subcritical mass of nuclear materials that allow scientists to examine the performance and safety of weapons without triggering a nuclear chain reaction and explosion .\nNorth Korea 's reference to such activity is designed to communicate that even without underground testing , the country intends to maintain its nuclear arsenal and be a `` responsible '' steward of those weapons at the same time , said Andrea Berger , a senior analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies .\nStill , the closure of the underground testing site could be a useful precedent for Washington and Seoul as they proceed with the nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang , analysts say .\n`` Now that North Korea has accepted in principle that agreements should be verified , U.S. negotiators should hold them to this standard for any subsequent agreement , '' said Adam Mount , a senior defense analyst at the Federation of American Scientists . `` It will make it more difficult for Kim Jong Un to deny inspections now that he has placed them on the table .
