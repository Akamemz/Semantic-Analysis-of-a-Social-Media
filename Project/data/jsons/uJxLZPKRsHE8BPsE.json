Every single Congressional Democrat voted against the GOP-passed tax reform law that slashed tax burdens for approximately 80 percent of all households -- - including an even higher percentage of middle-income families . The Left has deliberately and repeatedly lied about this reality , with minimal and perfunctory fact-checking from the media . As a result , only a fraction of the country realizes that their overall federal tax bill went down , based on recent polling . It 's important to set the record straight , and today is a good opportunity to do so . According to the Treasury Department , fully 90 percent of US workers experienced higher take-home pay in 2018 thanks to the new law . And here are the overall numbers , courtesy of the left-leaning Tax Policy Center :\nVia the left-leaning Tax Policy Center , 80.4 % of Americans ( & 91.3 % of middle income earners ) got a * tax CUT * in 2018 , thanks to the GOP tax reform law. ? ? ? ?\nEvery Democrat in Congress voted no . If they \u2019 d gotten their way , most Americans would be paying more ? ? pic.twitter.com/frGD2u266Q \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) April 14 , 2019\nLooking exclusively at the individual federal income tax changes in the law , TPC found that almost exactly two-thirds of Americans received a tax cut , averaging nearly $ 2,200 -- including 82 percent of middle-income earners , who averaged a tax cut of $ 1,050 . When all provisions of the law are examined , 80.4 percent of earners received a tax cut , including 91.3 percent of the middle class . Just 4.8 percent of the population saw their taxes go up , a disproportionate number of whom are higher-income earners who itemize deductions and live in high-tax states and jurisdictions . Broadly speaking , 80 percent saw a cut , 15 percent saw no change , and less than five percent saw an increase . This is the data .\nThe tax cuts will remain in effect for years to come , but if Congress fails to act down the road , the old rates will snap back into place toward the end of the ten-year budget window . Democrats complained about the lower rates being temporary for families , but permanent for businesses , using a hypothetical future expiration date to launch misleading attacks about the law being a middle class tax increase , with nearly all of the benefits going to the top one percent . As the table above illustrates , that talking point is utterly bogus -- and it 's even further exposed by House Democrats ' near-unanimous vote against making the individual rates permanent last year . One of the other ways Democrats have attempted to spin and mislead on the tax law is to conflate tax refunds with tax cuts . We addressed this ignorant sleight of hand in a previous post , but even that nonsense talking point has sustained another blow :\nH & R Block data through March 31 , 2019 shows the size of its clients \u2019 tax refunds is up 1.4 percent under the first year of tax reform and new withholding tables , while overall tax liability is down 24.9 percent on average ... Taxes down 25 percent , but refunds roughly flat , so where did the money go ? Given the 24.9 percent decrease in tax liability for H & R Block clients , taxpayers want to know where that money went . Survey analysis from H & R Block uncovers an issue : Nearly 80 percent of Americans did not update their W-4 last year , resulting in a bump in their paychecks throughout the year , sometimes more than their taxes decreased . Now , H & R Block data reveals just how much the TCJA impacted taxpayers \u2019 paychecks . With tax liability down nearly $ 1,200 on average , but refunds up just $ 43 , an average of $ 1,156 went into paychecks during the year , or about $ 50 a biweekly paycheck starting in March of 2018 . The impact of the withholding changes will be amplified in 2019 because they will be in effect all 12 months of the year .\nPeople 's taxes went down significantly , boosting their paychecks throughout the year . Refunds increased , too , but only by a little bit , because most of the tax relief was distributed in smaller increments every two weeks . This mismatch is what some politicians have sought to exploit to deceive people into thinking that the tax reductions did n't help them . It 's also essential not to lose sight of the bigger picture : Following passage of the tax reform law , unemployment has scraped multi-decade lows ( nearly 2.7 million American jobs were created in the year following its implementation , a double-digit increase over the previous year ) , wages have increased at the best pace in a decade , and jobless claims have plummeted :\nThe number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49-1/2-year low last week , pointing to sustained labor market strength that could temper expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth . Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 196,000 for the week ended April 6 , the lowest level since early October 1969 .
