    "content": "The more ambitious liberalism has become in its efforts to transform the United States , the more it has run up against one intransigent circumstance after another . For eight years , the idol worship of Barack Obama gave liberals confidence that they could remediate society and reeducate the citizens . But reality isn \u2019 t political . It doesn \u2019 t obey the principles of progressives . Some facts aren \u2019 t pliable .\n1 . The economy is roaring under the Trump tenure . It \u2019 s no surprise that this fact lands on the list . GDP and the stock market are up and unemployment and food stamp claims are down . If those trends happened under Hillary Clinton , journalists would gush and bow , but instead we get quibbles and warnings of what the future may hold . Ezra Klein even argued that with such a low unemployment rate ( 3.8 % ) , Trump \u2019 s economy should be performing much better than it is . In other words , even good news is bad news in the liberal mind .\n2 . People like walls . Progressives want open borders and limitless migration , and that may please the renowned professor who grew up in one city , went to school 1,000 miles away , took a job in yet another state , and lectures and does research in Europe each year . But most people want a home and they want security . They believe that good fences make good neighbors , that a country without walls isn \u2019 t a country . Walls reinforce the pride of ownership , too . When liberals decry walls , they belittle the sense of place that people find comforting and meaningful .\n3 . Men and women are different . You wouldn \u2019 t think this obvious fact would be controversial , especially one backed by vast biological and social science findings . ( See here and here . ) But liberals are now committed to the elimination of sexual difference . That \u2019 s why they have lionized the trans- individual . Difference leads to unequal outcomes , they believe , and so it must be attributed to patriarchy , not to nature . They can \u2019 t accept scientific evidence that women tend to prefer working with people , men with things . They must , instead , insist that the population of engineers must be 50 percent female .\n4 . The LGBT population is tiny . This is an inconvenient fact in that liberals wish to remove any implication of abnormality from non-heterosexual individuals . But the Centers for Disease Control count the LGBT group less than four percent . If we subtract bisexuals from the cohort ( liberals rarely highlight them ) , the rate falls under three percent . When 24 out of 25 people act in one way , we can \u2019 t help judging them normal and the other one abnormal .\n5 . Different groups have different abilities , on average . This proposition makes liberals very nervous , as shown in their response to IQ discussions . We don \u2019 t have to enter the nature vs. nurture debate , however , to find evidence of average differences between racial groups .

For eight years, the idol worship of Barack Obama gave liberals confidence that they could remediate society and reeducate the citizens. But reality isn\u2019t political. It doesn\u2019t obey the principles of progressives. Some facts aren\u2019t pliable.\n\n1. The economy is roaring under the Trump tenure. It\u2019s no surprise that this fact lands on the list. GDP and the stock market are up and unemployment and food stamp claims are down. If those trends happened under Hillary Clinton, journalists would gush and bow, but instead we get quibbles and warnings of what the future may hold. Ezra Klein even argued that with such a low unemployment rate (3.8%), Trump\u2019s economy should be performing much better than it is.

Progressives want open borders and limitless migration, and that may please the renowned professor who grew up in one city, went to school 1,000 miles away, took a job in yet another state, and lectures and does research in Europe each year. But most people want a home and they want security. They believe that good fences make good neighbors, that a country without walls isn\u2019t a country. Walls reinforce the pride of ownership, too. When liberals decry walls, they belittle the sense of place that people find comforting and meaningful.\n\n3. Men and women are different. You wouldn\u2019t think this obvious fact would be controversial, especially one backed by vast biological and social science findings. (See here and here.)

On the crucial yardstick of academic achievement, for instance, gap between blacks and whites hasn\u2019t closed for many years (see scores for 12th graders here), and the standard answer given by progressives (\u201csystemic racism\u201d) has no solid science to support it. The more liberals refuse to consider other causes of achievement gaps such as single-parentage and cultural differences between races, the more obtuse and ideological they sound.\n\n6. The traditional family is best. Just this week a study came out showing that being a child of divorce cuts in half the likelihood of that child earning a college degree. That\u2019s just one of hundreds of studies demonstrating worse outcomes for children from broken homes. The infamous \u201cLife of Julia\u201d ad for the Obama 2012 campaign peddled a feminist myth contrary to this mountain of evidence, showing that a woman needn\u2019t worry about finding a man to help raise her child.

Furthermore, at the doctoral level, women have earned more PhDs than men for many years now, and there are 135 of them for every 100 men in graduate programs.\n\n8. The \u201cdeplorables\u201d have good reason to mistrust their betters. It\u2019s not just that politicians, economists and financiers, artists and entertainers, academics and intellectuals have failed so often in the 21st century to act as good stewards of their respective domains. It\u2019s also that the men and women of the street now know exactly what the elite think of them. You can\u2019t trust people who despise you.\n\n9. Religious people lead better lives. It\u2019s been a long time since Hollywood presented faith in God and regular churchgoing as the basis of happiness. But in measures of well-being, believers keep coming up stronger than non-believers. They are also more charitable.
