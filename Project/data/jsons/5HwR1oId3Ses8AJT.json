Among them was Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte , Virginia Republican .\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said this week that President Obama supports the move because he believes a prohibition on armor-piercing bullets will save the lives of law-enforcement officers . The ATF said in a report that newer handguns are capable of firing the ammo , which is primarily used in rifles for target practice or hunting game .\nBut the lawmakers and others who track Second Amendment issues say the steel-tipped , .223 caliber M855 ammunition has not been used in any fatal shootings of police officers . Opponents are concerned that the proposal is a backdoor effort by the administration to eliminate the use of AR-15 rifles , and many police officers also oppose the ban .\n\u201c The ATF should refocus its efforts on serious threats to law enforcement officers , \u201d the lawmakers wrote .
