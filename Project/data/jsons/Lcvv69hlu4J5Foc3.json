One frequent analyst on Fox News has an unusual credential. Robert Driscoll is a lawyer who represents a woman accused of being a Russian spy. But viewers don't always know about that credential. Here's NPR's David Folkenflik.\n\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: The principle at stake was encapsulated pretty neatly back in May by, of all people, Fox News host Laura Ingraham. She was mocking the frequent TV appearances of the attorney for Stormy Daniels, who alleges she was paid during the 2016 campaign to hush up her earlier affair with President Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEDIA BUZZ\")\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM: There has been quite a few - have been quite a few mistruths stated by Michael Avenatti, who is brought on to some of these other networks as almost, like, an analyst.
