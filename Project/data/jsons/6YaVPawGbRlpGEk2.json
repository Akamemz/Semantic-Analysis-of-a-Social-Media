( RELATED : Jury Finds Illegal Immigrant NOT GUILTY In Kate Steinle Murder )\nThe Steinle case has attracted national attention ever since her murder occurred in 2015 in the sanctuary city of San Francisco . The murder became the focal point in the debate over illegal immigration , showing the dangers of sanctuary city policies and how America can \u2019 t secure its borders from convicted felons with multiple deportations .\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump highlighted the murder several times on the campaign trail for why America needs to get tough on illegal immigration and eliminate sanctuary city policies .\nThere was always a political element to the case , and that comes into play as to why a San Francisco jury sought fit to let Zarate go free without even an involuntary manslaughter charge .\nThe prosecution team does warrant some of the blame for why that occurred . As RedState \u2019 s Sarah Rumpf argued , prosecutorial overreach trying to get a harder to prove first-degree murder charge bears some responsibility for the exoneration of Zarate for Kate \u2019 s killing .\nHowever , that factor can \u2019 t be solely responsible for the not guilty verdict for an illegal immigrant who somehow accidentally fired off a gun three times with no malicious intent in mind .\nSan Francisco is a very liberal area and jury selection , according to Zarate \u2019 s defense team , was ensured to better benefit their client .\n\u201c We are very pleased with the jury , \u201d said Matt Gonzalez , the lead defense lawyer for Zarate , upon the completion of jury selection . \u201c We have such great diversity built in in San Francisco and I think we have a jury that understands a lot of the concerns about the defendant receiving a fair trial . \u201d\nThat diversity was reflected in the jury consisting of three immigrants , at least one of whom \u2019 s primary language was Spanish .
