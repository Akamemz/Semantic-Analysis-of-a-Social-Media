    "content": "GOP Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan delivered exceptionally strong remarks in Tampa tonight , capping off an incredible hour of nationally-televised speeches from Republican headliners . The construction and tone of Ryan 's address was masterful . He was serious , earnest , likeable -- and he took apart President Obama 's record with great skill and relish . The Congressman opened with a stark assessment of the dismal campaign President Obama has been forced to run , due to his failed record in office :\nI \u2019 m the newcomer to the campaign , so let me share a first impression . I have never seen opponents so silent about their record , and so desperate to keep their power . They \u2019 ve run out of ideas . Their moment came and went . Fear and division are all they \u2019 ve got left . With all their attack ads , the president is just throwing away money \u2013 and he \u2019 s pretty experienced at that . You see , some people can \u2019 t be dragged down by the usual cheap tactics , because their ability , character , and plain decency are so obvious \u2013 and ladies and gentlemen , that is Mitt Romney .\nThe Wisconsin native spoke about his family and upbringing , introducing his wife and young children , as well as his mother -- whom he called his `` role model . '' On a policy level , he ticked down the list of the current administration 's misfires , mistakes and mendacity ; he hit the stimulus , Solyndra , unemployment , the credit downgrade , and Obama 's inexpiable abdication of leadership on deficits and debt . Ryan really warmed to his task as he spelled out the case against Obamacare :\nMaybe the greatest waste of all was time . Here we were , faced with a massive job crisis \u2013 so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file , that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire American continent . You would think that any president , whatever his party , would make job creation , and nothing else , his first order of economic business . But this president didn \u2019 t do that . Instead , we got a long , divisive , all-or-nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care . Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules , mandates , taxes , fees , and fines that have no place in a free country .
