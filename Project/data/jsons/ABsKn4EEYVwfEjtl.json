Robbins ( 1997 ) , should be kept in place by the justices or struck down in its entirety . In Auer , the Court held that when an `` ambiguous '' regulation promulgated by a federal agency is challenged in court , the judge or judges hearing the case should respect the expertise of the agency and its staff and therefore defer to the agency 's interpretation of its own regulation .

''\nCritics of Auer deference argue that the doctrine is tantamount to judicial abdication , that it tells judges to stop doing their judicial duty .

In Auer, the Court held that when an \"ambiguous\" regulation promulgated by a federal agency is challenged in court, the judge or judges hearing the case should respect the expertise of the agency and its staff and therefore defer to the agency's interpretation of its own regulation. An agency's interpretation, the Court held in Auer, is \"controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations being interpreted.\"\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court decided a case that asked the justices to overrule Auer once and for all.
