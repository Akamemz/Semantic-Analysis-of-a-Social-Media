Obama has lost Congress to Republicans that hope to use the next two years to reverse his accomplishments and lay the groundwork for a presidential win in 2016. Their invitation to Netanyahu is part of that effort.\n\nBoehner rejected criticism by Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, who said Netanyahu\u2019s public confrontation with the president over Iran was damaging the U.S.-Israel relationship.

There has long been tension over Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians as well as over American arms sales and relations with Arab countries. But the gap over Iran is of a different order of magnitude.\n\nNetanyahu has argued for years that no development would threaten Israel as much as an Iranian nuclear weapon. Such a weapon, he says, would immunize Iran against military action and could be passed to Iranian-backed anti-Israel forces like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. The deal being offered the Iranians will force a delay, he says, not an end to their nuclear program.\n\nObama counters that he fully agrees about the danger of an Iran with nuclear weapons, and that the accord he\u2019s seeking to reach with Iran will prevent that and work toward luring the Islamic Republic back into the family of nations by slowly reducing sanctions.\n\nIn Iran, top officials including the conservative Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have publicly supported a deal.\n\nEasy Choice\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s clash with Obama has caused a backlash in Washington that undermines the Israeli leader\u2019s objective of influencing Congress, said Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security in the U.S. capital.\n\n\u201cThe people he really needs to target are the Democrats, specifically the fence-sitters on the Democratic side, and they now feel as though they have been put in a position where they have to decide between the Israeli prime minister and the president of the United States,\u201d said Goldenberg, a former Senate staff member and State Department official. \u201cAs much as they are strong supporters of Israel, it\u2019s not a very difficult choice for them -- they\u2019re going to choose the president.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hope to benefit from the tension. Jeb Bush, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, told the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom in an interview published Friday that Netanyahu should be heard because he is right and the White House wrong on the Iran deal.\n\nFather\u2019s Grave\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s decision to address Congress may spring not only from a deep concern about Iran but also a belief that public speaking is one of his strengths. He first came to American attention as a diplomat in the 1980s and appeared frequently on television making Israel\u2019s case, especially during the first Gulf War.\n\nAmong Netanyahu\u2019s preparations for this trip was visiting the grave of his father Benzion, a historian who infused his son with concerns about the dangers facing the Jewish people.\n\nPosting on his campaign\u2019s Facebook page, Netanyahu said: \u201cI will continue to follow his path.
