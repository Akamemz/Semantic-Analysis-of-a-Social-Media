    "content": "The Republican National Convention in Tampa , Fla. received mediocre television ratings \u2014 and the polling data so far suggests that it may produce only a modest bounce in the polls for Mitt Romney .\nThe most favorable number for Mr. Romney is from the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll . That survey showed him pulling into a 3-point lead against President Obama on Saturday . All of the interviews in the Rasmussen poll were conducted after the convention began , although only about one-third were conducted after Mr. Romney \u2019 s acceptance speech on Thursday night .\nThe Rasmussen poll represents a 5-point swing toward Mr. Romney from the polling firm \u2019 s final survey before the conventions , when it had Mr. Obama ahead by two points . But it does not read quite as strongly for him as compared to the long-term average of Rasmussen polls , which have had Mr. Romney ahead by about one percentage point on average over the past 60 days .\nAnother survey , an online tracking poll conducted by the polling firm Ipsos , had previously shown a decent-sized bounce for Mr. Romney \u2014 but it has since receded some . In the version of the poll that Ipsos released on Saturday , Mr. Obama led by one percentage point , 44-43 , among likely voters . That \u2019 s a better result for Mr. Romney than the survey the firm conducted prior to the conventions , when Mr. Romney had trailed by four points . But it reflects a reversal from Thursday , when Mr. Romney was up by two points in the poll .\nThe most sluggish of the tracking polls is from Gallup , which reports its results over a lengthy seven-day window . That means that only about half its interviews occurred after the start of the convention , and a smaller fraction than that will represent people surveyed after Mr. Romney \u2019 s acceptance address .\nHowever , the trend so far in the Gallup poll is a bit disappointing for Mr. Romney ; the survey still shows Mr. Obama one point ahead . By comparison , the Gallup poll has had a 46-46 tie on average over the past 60 days .\nWe \u2019 ll need to wait another day or two before we can make a more confident judgement on the size of Mr. Romney \u2019 s bounce , but the information we have so far points toward its being a little underwhelming .\nThe FiveThirtyEight \u201c now-cast \u201d , which does not adjust for the bounces associated with the party conventions , estimates that Mr. Obama would have a 72.3 percent chance of winning if the election were held today . That \u2019 s essentially unchanged from before the conventions , when the number had ranged between about 70 percent and 74 percent .\nOne way to interpret the trend in the \u201c now-cast \u201d is that , so far , Mr. Romney \u2019 s bounce is hard to distinguish from the statistical noise that we ordinarily see in polls . Based on the data that they published on Saturday , Mr. Romney \u2019 s standing in the Rasmussen poll was two points better than its 60-day average , but it was one point worse than average in the Gallup poll .\nThe FiveThirtyEight forecast , which penalizes a candidate in its evaluation of polls conducted just after his party convention , interprets the data as being slightly negative for Mr. Romney . On Saturday , Mr. Obama \u2019 s chances of winning the Electoral College rose to 73.1 percent in the forecast , its highest figure since Aug. 16 , when it was 73.6 percent .\nBut whatever assumptions you make about a convention bounce , it introduces more noise into the polling . Both the forecast and the \u201c now-cast \u201d are therefore likely to be more unstable than usual over the next week or two , and they should be interpreted with plenty of caution .\nIf Mr. Romney \u2019 s bounce turns out to be mediocre , the pressure will then be on Mr. Obama . If the polls fail to move much in his direction after the Democratic convention in Charlotte , N.C. , the gains he has made in the FiveThirtyEight forecast over the past few days will be reversed .",
