    "content": "Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has launched a new investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019 s effort to thwart a Bangladesh government corruption probe of Muhammad Yunus , a Clinton Foundation donor and close friend of the Clintons .\nThe Iowa Republican \u2019 s effort is the first new official inquiry of Clinton since her unexpected loss in the 2016 presidential election to President Donald Trump . Trump \u2019 s supporters often chanted \u201c lock her up \u201d during his many boisterous campaign rallies .\nBut upon assuming the presidency , Trump and leaders of the Republican-majority Congress displayed little appetite for reopening investigations of Clinton \u2019 s tenure as the chief U.S. diplomat and multiple persistent allegations of \u201c pay-to-play \u201d corruption involving the Clinton Foundation . Until now .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 News Foundation ( TheDCNF ) Investigative Group exclusively reported in May that Clinton sent top U.S. diplomats to pressure Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and her son Sajeeb Wazed in an effort to kill that country \u2019 s corruption investigation of Yunus and Grameen Bank . Yunus was then managing director of the state-owned Bangladesh bank .\nIn a June 1 , 2017 , letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , Grassley repeated TheDCNF charge that Clinton threatened Wazed with an IRS tax audit if his mother did not back away from the corruption probe . Wazed has lived in the U.S. for 17 years .\n\u201c If the Secretary of State used her position to intervene in an independent investigation by a sovereign government simply because of a personal and financial relationship stemming from the Clinton Foundation rather than the legitimate foreign policy interests of the United States , then that would be unacceptable , \u201d Grassley told Tillerson .\n\u201c Co-mingling her official position as Secretary of State with her family foundation would be similarly inappropriate . It is vital to determine whether the State Department had any role in the threat of an IRS audit against the son of the Prime Minister in retaliation for this investigation , \u201d Grassley continued .\nGrassley described how U.S. ambassadors James Moriarty and Dan Mozena , as well as Jon Danilowica , the Deputy Chief of Mission , met with Wazed in the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka , Bangladesh \u2019 s capital , on numerous occasions while the corruption investigation was underway . All three are career diplomats .\nAnother official , U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) Administrator Rajiv Shah also met with Wazed . Shah \u2019 s agency awarded $ 13 million to Yunus organizations and another $ 11 million to allied Yunus organizations during Clinton \u2019 s tenure . The Department of State oversees USAID programs .\nAs TheDCNF previously reported , Clinton \u2019 s aid to Yunus included 18 grants , contracts and loans awarded to two of his America-based foundations , the Grameen Foundation USA and Grameen America , according to USASpending.gov .\nYunus was stripped of his directorship of the state owned Grameen Bank in 2011 as a result of the Bangladesh government \u2019 s review of his financial mismanagement of the bank and its \u201c micro-credit \u201d loan program for poor peasants , mainly women .\nA Norwegian documentary charging Yunus personally diverted $ 100 million intended for Grameen Bank and for the poor to his other organizations triggered the initial investigation against him . The pocketing of funds shocked many in poverty-stricken Bangladesh where the annual per capita income is about $ 3,600 , according to the World Bank .\nYunus eventually returned the money to Grameen Bank , but the government \u2019 s investigation exposed serious financial mismanagement and found the micro-loan program failed to lift recipients out of poverty . He was forced to resign under a law making 60 the maximum age for the bank \u2019 s top position . Yunus was 70 at the time .\nInterest rates and payback amounts of the micro-loans sometimes resulted in more poverty , not less . Rather than re-paying the loans , a number of recipients in Bangladesh and India committed suicide .\nClinton \u2019 s support for Yunus dates to former President Bill Clinton \u2019 s years as Arkansas governor . Both Clintons became micro-credit loan advocates and enthusiastic backers of Yunus , who invented the lending scheme . Bill Clinton reportedly lobbied the Nobel Prize Committee on behalf of Yunus . The committee awarded him the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize .\nFrom 2008 onward , Yunus was a featured speaker at the glitzy Clinton Global Initiative \u2019 s annual meeting . He donated between $ 100,000- $ 250,000 to CGI and $ 25,000- $ 50,000 to the Clinton Foundation , according to the Clinton Foundation website .\nWazed told TheDCNF it was \u201c astounding and mind boggling \u201d to him that between 2010 and 2012 senior State Department officials repeatedly pressured him to influence his mother to drop the Grameen Bank investigation .\n\u201c They threatened me with the possibility of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service , \u201d Wazed said . \u201c They would say over and over again , \u2018 Yunus has powerful friends \u2019 and we all knew they were talking of Secretary Clinton .
