    "content": "The White House on Tuesday began to lay out a public justification for a possible bombing of Syria , saying the nation \u2019 s use of chemical weapons is a threat to U.S. interests \u2014 a scenario that opens the door to military strikes that wouldn \u2019 t require authorization from Congress or the United Nations .\nSpokesman Jay Carney said President Obama had not decided on military action but was conferring with lawmakers , allies and members of his national security team about the forcefulness needed to punish the Syrian government for violating international law .\n\u201c It is in the clear national security interests of the United States that the use or proliferation of chemical weapons on this scale not go unanswered , \u201d Mr. Carney said , adding that the attack was of particular concern because it took place \u201c in this highly volatile region . \u201d\nMr. Carney did not describe the intelligence that linked Syrian President Bashar Assad to the attack or how it was a direct threat to the U.S. , which would give the Mr. Obama latitude in starting a bombing campaign . But he did say the Assad regime is the only force in Syria known to have chemical weapons and the rockets that could deliver them .\nHe also said intelligence agencies are preparing to provide evidence of Mr. Assad \u2019 s role in the attack and cited the Chemical Weapons Convention , an international arms control agreement that bans the use of such weapons . The U.S. and 188 other nations have signed the pact ; Syria has not .\nThe administration is making its case to a war-weary public and is beginning to meet resistance from Congress , where Democrats and Republicans say the president needs to be more transparent about a military strike on a country that has not attacked the U.S .\nSEE ALSO : Syrians vow to \u2018 burn America \u2019 s skies \u2019 on Obama \u2019 s Facebook\n\u201c Before any action is taken regarding Syria , it is imperative that President Obama make the case to the American people and consult with Congress , \u201d said Sen.

Kerry said it was undeniable that the regime had used chemical weapons and called the act a \u201c moral obscenity . \u201d\nBut on Tuesday in Damascus , the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency issued a statement accusing Mr. Kerry of citing \u201c fabricated \u201d evidence and saying he was \u201c jumping over \u201d the work of U.N. inspectors , showing that the U.S. intended to exploit events .\nAlso , Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim said the Assad government was not obstructing the work of U.N.-backed inspectors trying to examine the scene of the attack .
