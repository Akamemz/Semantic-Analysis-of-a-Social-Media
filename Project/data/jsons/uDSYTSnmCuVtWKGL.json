    "content": "President Obama could be on shaky legal ground with his assertion of executive privilege in a congressional investigation that has been going on for a year , according to scholars who study the limits of presidential power .\nLouis Fisher , a former specialist on the separation of powers at the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service , said he found the administration \u2019 s arguments \u201c extremely unpersuasive . \u201d\nMr. Fisher noted that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. , in a letter to the president , cited the need to protect the Justice Department \u2019 s \u201c deliberative process \u201d in responding to the congressional inquiry into a botched gun-running operation .\n\u201c Yet he admits throughout his letter to Obama that the department has regularly provided the House committee with documents \u201d involved in drafting a particular letter to the committee on Feb. 4 , 2011 , Mr. Fisher said .\n\u201c He states that the department \u2018 has already shared with the Committee over 1,300 pages of documents concerning the drafting of the Feb. 4 letter , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Fisher said . \u201c In short , Holder was willing to release documents about that deliberative process . \u201d\nMr. Fisher , who has testified before Congress and written a book about executive privilege , also said Mr. Holder repeatedly cites \u201c the fundamentally false notion that when Congress wants information from the executive branch , it must be in furtherance of a \u2018 legitimate legislative responsibility. \u2019 \u201c\n\u201c The constitutional right of Congress to pursue oversight \u2014 is as legitimate as its legislative function , \u201d Mr. Fisher said . \u201c Oversight is also essential in investigating corruption and illegal activity in the executive branch . \u201d\nDocuments requested by House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell E. Issa , California Republican , in the \u201c Fast and Furious \u201d gun-running operation \u201c should not qualify for executive privilege , \u201d said Maureen Martin , senior fellow for legal affairs at the Heartland Institute , a conservative think-tank based in Chicago .\n\u201c The Supreme Court has held that executive privilege is \u2018 an extraordinary assertion of power not to be lightly invoked , \u2019 \u201d she said in a statement . \u201c It is intended to safeguard deliberations in the executive branch over what course of action to take . That was decided long ago as far as Fast and Furious is concerned . \u201d\nBut Steven D. Schwinn , an associate professor of law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago , said he believes Mr. Obama \u2019 s claim of privilege is valid .\n\u201c The committee appears to seek material relating to purely internal executive deliberations about how to respond to committee and press inquiries , and not to the substance of the program and other matters , \u201d Mr. Schwinn said . \u201c Largely for the reasons that the attorney general gives in his letter to the president , I think he \u2019 s right that this material is covered by executive privilege as against the committee \u2019 s request for it . \u201d\nThe White House defended its assertion of executive privilege Wednesday , saying Mr. Obama has used the tactic only once , far less than his predecessors .\nBut scholars say what matters in court is the legal validity of presidential claims of privilege , not their frequency . The move also was awkward for a president who claims to be running for re-election as having the most transparent administration in history , and it opened up a new front in Mr. Obama \u2019 s ongoing feud with congressional Republicans .\nA court decision from the administration of former President Bill Clinton is considered one of the most definitive on the subject of presidential privilege . The case involved then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy , who came under investigation by an independent counsel in 1994 over accusations of improper gifts . ( He resigned and was indicted , but was acquitted . )\nA grand jury subpoenaed a report that the White House counsel \u2019 s office had prepared for Mr. Clinton on the Espy case , and Mr. Clinton cited executive privilege in refusing to turn over some of the documents . A federal appeals court decision in 1997 made clear that such claims are limited to White House officials , according to the CRS .\n\u201c The court \u2019 s opinion carefully distinguishes between the \u2018 presidential communications privilege \u2019 and the \u2018 deliberative process privilege , \u2019 \u201d the CRS report stated . \u201c Both , the court observed , are executive privileges designed to protect the confidentiality of executive branch decisionmaking . But the deliberative process privilege , that applies to executive branch officials generally , is a common law privilege which requires a lower threshold of need to be overcome , and \u2018 disappears altogether when there is any reason to believe government misconduct has occurred . \u2019 \u201d\nMr. Holder and a top deputy defended the claim by saying the documents are not relevant to the original Fast and Furious operation , and that turning over such documents would have a chilling effect on the ability of a president \u2019 s top aides to give him advice confidentially .\nA White House spokesman said Mr. Obama \u201c has gone longer without asserting the privilege in a congressional dispute \u201d than any other president in the past three decades . The White House said President George W. Bush asserted executive privilege six times , while President Bill Clinton did so 14 times .\nMr. Bush asserted executive privilege to block release of documents and testimony under oath by top White House aides , including White House counsel Harriet Miers , concerning the administration \u2019 s firing of nine federal prosecutors in 2006 . Those aides later gave testimony in private , under a deal arranged by the Obama administration .\nBut the use of that privilege is one that Mr. Obama tried to exploit as a candidate for president . In 2007 , then-Sen. Obama criticized Mr. Bush for trying to \u201c hide \u201d behind executive privilege in the case of the fired U.S. attorneys .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been a tendency , on the part of this administration , to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there \u2019 s something a little shaky that \u2019 s taking place , \u201d Mr. Obama told CNN \u2019 s Larry King . \u201c I think the administration would be best served by coming clean on this . There doesn \u2019 t seem to be any national security issues involved . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c There doesn \u2019 t seem to be any justification for not offfering up some clear plausible rationale for why these U.S. attorneys were targeted when by all assessments they were doing an outstanding job . I think the American people deserve to know what was going on there . \u201d\nA White House aide said the executive privilege claim was in response to a congressional investigation that is \u201c all politics . \u201d\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland , the committee \u2019 s ranking Democrat said claims of privilege should be used sparingly . But he said in this case , the administration was \u201c forced into this position by the committee \u2019 s unreasonable insistence on pressing forward with contempt despite the attorney general \u2019 s good faith offer . \u201d\nPresidents typically cite executive privilege to protect aides within the White House under the reasoning that a president \u2019 s closest advisers should be able to give their advice freely in private .\nBut Mr. Obama \u2019 s assertion of executive privilege in the Justice Department \u2019 s \u201c Fast and Furious \u201d operation has critics questioning whether the president himself became involved in the internal discussions about the administration \u2019 s response to the probe .\n\u201c Until now , everyone believed that the decisions regarding \u2018 Fast and Furious \u2019 were confined to the Department of Justice , \u201d said Brendan Buck , a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican .\n\u201c The White House decision to invoke executive privilege implies that White House officials were either involved in the \u2018 Fast and Furious \u2019 operation or the cover-up that followed . The Administration has always insisted that wasn \u2019 t the case . Were they lying , or are they now bending the law to hide the truth ? \u201d Mr. Buck said .\nIt \u2019 s also an uncomfortable position for a president who hails his administration \u2019 s transparency , for example , in matters such as releasing White House visitor logs . As a candidate , Mr. Obama pledged to enforce \u201c a new standard of openness . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re constantly trying to open up the process , \u201d Mr. Obama said in January 2010 .\nWhen he was campaigning for the presidency in 2007 , Mr. Obama promised to reserve the use of executive privilege for cases of national security or \u201c traditionally sensitive matters . \u201d\nIn 2004 , Mr. Fisher noted , the George W.
