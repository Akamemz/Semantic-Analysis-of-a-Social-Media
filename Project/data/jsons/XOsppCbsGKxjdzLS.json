    "content": "House Republicans say their goal is to repeal President Obama 's health care law , not to present an alternative plan .\n`` I do n't think it 's a matter of what we put on the floor right now , '' said Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon , who heads the party 's campaign committee . He added that what is important is `` trying to delay Obamacare . ''\nHis remarks are in response to criticism that the Republican-led House have voted more than three dozen times over the past several years to repeal the law in part or in whole .\nOn the larger question about the recent success of Congress , House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday it `` ought to be judged on how many laws we repeal '' not `` by how many new laws we create . ''\nBoehner told CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' the United States has `` more laws than the administration could ever enforce . ''\nOfficially , the Republican effort to craft an alternative health care plan is a work `` in progress '' and has been since Jan. 19 , 2011 , according to GOP.gov , a leadership-run website .\nBut internal divisions , disagreement about political tactics and Obama 's 2012 re-election have resulted in uncertainty about whether Republicans will vote on a plan of their own before the 2014 elections , or if not by then , perhaps before the president leaves office , more than six years after the original promise .\nRep. Fred Upton of Michigan , who leads a committee with jurisdiction over health care , said , `` If we are successful in ultimately repealing this legislation , then yes , we will have a replacement bill ready to come back with . ''\nDivisions were evident earlier this year , when legislation to make it easier for high-risk individuals to purchase coverage died without a vote . It was sidetracked after conservatives , many of them elected with tea party support , objected to any attempt to improve the current law rather than scuttle it .\nWith the rank and file growing more conservative , some Republicans acknowledge that without changes , they likely could n't pass the alternative measure they backed when Democrats won approval for Obama 's bill in 2010 . Among other provisions , it encouraged employers to sign up their workers for health insurance automatically , so that employees would have to `` opt out '' of coverage if they did n't want it , and provided federal money for state-run high-risk pools for individuals and for reinsurance in the small group market .\nThe current state of intentions contrasts sharply with the Pledge to America , the manifesto that Republicans campaigned on in 2010 when they took power away from the Democrats . That included a plan to `` repeal and replace '' what it termed a government takeover of health care .\nIt promised `` common-sense solutions focused on lowering costs and protecting American jobs , '' including steps to overhaul medical malpractice laws and permit the sale of insurance across state lines . Republicans said they would `` empower small businesses with greater purchasing power and create new incentives to save for future health care needs . '' They promised to `` protect the doctor-patient relationship , and ensure that those with pre-existing conditions gain access to the coverage they need . ''\nBut Rep. Paul Broun , R-Ga. , said , `` We never did see a repeal and replace bill last time , '' referring to the 2011-2012 two-year term that followed the Republican landslide . `` I hope we can this time , and I 'll keep fighting for it . ''\nBroun , running for the Senate from Georgia in 2014 as a conservatives ' conservative , has drafted legislation of his own that relies on a series of tax breaks and regulatory changes such as permitting insurance companies to sell coverage across state lines to expand access to health care .\nOther Republicans are at work on different bills , in the House Energy and Commerce Committee headed by Upton , and elsewhere .\nRep. Steven Scalise of Louisiana , who leads the conservative Republican Study Conference , said the organization is working on legislation to reduce health care costs `` without the mandates and the taxes '' in the current law .\nLike others involved with the issue , he provided no timetable and few specifics .\nAt the same time , the other half of the 2010 pledge to `` repeal and replace '' is getting a workout .\nThe House voted last week to delay two requirements , the 38th and 39th time they have gone on record in favor of repealing , reducing or otherwise neutering the system that bears Obama 's name .\nIn the case of one of the rules , a requirement for businesses to provide insurance to their workers , the administration announced a one-year delay earlier this month .\nDemocrats and even some Republicans say the intense focus on repealing the health law is wide of the mark .\n`` Every voter knows what Republicans are against .
