For example , when a story was attributed to other users , participants actually liked reading it more .

Increasingly , most of our online destinations\u2014whether they \u2019 re portal sites ( such as Yahoo News and Google News ) , social media sites , retail sites or search engines\u2014have tools that allow us to customize the site , tailoring it to our own interests , and identity ( for example , choosing a profile photo or a news feed about one \u2019 s favorite sports team ) .\nOur research shows that internet users are less skeptical of information that appears in these customized environments .
