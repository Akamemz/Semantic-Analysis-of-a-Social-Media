    "content": "An explosive confrontation brewing between the House Republican leadership and conservatives over Planned Parenthood is threatening to shut down the government for the second time in three years . And House GOP leaders have yet to settle on a strategy to avert it .\nDesperate to avoid another closure , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) and his team would prefer to build bipartisan opposition to funding the group through a series of high-profile Congressional investigations . But , at this point , that seems unlikely to cut it with a bloc of House conservatives who have said they simply won \u2019 t vote for a large-scale spending plan that funds Planned Parenthood .\nFunding runs dry Sept. 30 , so Republican leaders have barely have a month to figure it out .\nMany GOP aides are skeptical of using a funding bill to cut off the group \u2019 s government money , aware that the legislation would likely die in the Senate . And , even if Congress could broker a deal on Planned Parenthood , anything that cuts its government funding would likely be vetoed by President Barack Obama .\nInstead , House GOP leaders would rather use \u2019 s Congress \u2019 broad investigative powers to build an overwhelming case against the group , which they believe would allow them to hammer Planned Parenthood for months and put Democrats under enormous pressure to turn against the women \u2019 s health organization .\nBut conservatives \u2013 led by Rep. Jim Jordan \u2019 s ( R-Ohio ) Freedom Caucus \u2013 are girding for battle . They see the fight over Planned Parenthood \u2019 s money as one of the top legislative priorities of 2015 , and they are eager to do anything to end government support . Jordan , in an interview , said an investigation is important , but the leadership must cut off the women \u2019 s health group \u2019 s money in any spending bill that comes up this fall . He wants to shift the money to community health clinics .
