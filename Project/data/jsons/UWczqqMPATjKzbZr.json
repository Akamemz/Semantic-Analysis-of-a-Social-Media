A good place to start might be to analyze two of the biggest issues they care about , how those issues fit together , and how both could be mitigated if only liberals cared about actually making progress toward solving the issues instead of just posturing for power .\nFirst , it \u2019 s a no-brainer that liberals love immigration from the Third World .

Throw open our borders to everyone who wants to \u201c breathe free \u201d or even takes a notion to breath in some free stuff , and all our past racial sins can be atoned for , or something .\nThe real reason , of course , is that liberals want more power , and unlimited immigration from the Third World promises to give them more of it . Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel explained as much during a Saturday night Fox News appearance with Judge Jeanine Pirro .\n\u201c They want porous borders , \u201d said McDaniel , responding to Pirro \u2019 s question about why Democrats don \u2019 t seem to care about border security . \u201c I do think that they want porous borders to help get voters . I think they feel like if they have porous borders and they bring these people into this country and they show that they will let them in that they \u2019 ll be voters for them in the future . \u201d\nExplaining that it literally changes the electoral map , \u201d McDaniel noted that the state of California \u201c now counts non-citizens in their census , \u201d which \u201c inflates their congressional representation . \u201d\n\u201c This is a power play that Democrats have made , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s certainly not about the working men and women in this country . \u201d\nMcDaniel \u2019 s assessment is something that conservatives have suspected all along , though not all have had the guts to call them on it . The problem , of course , is that liberals can simply deny it .\nFine . Let them deny it . Then ask them this : If liberals care so much about the environment , why would they want to hurt it by bringing Third Worlders en masse to the \u2018 First World ? \u2019\nNow I \u2019 m no expert at so-called climate science , not by a long shot . I think the earth is probably warming , but then again I also think there isn \u2019 t much of anything humans can do about it significantly one way or another and that any governmental efforts to somehow curb what is happening that hampers economic freedom and lessens human comfort are simply power grabs , nothing more .\nBut liberals say they care , and they care a lot . Since they \u2019 re always going on about it , let \u2019 s use some of their own terminology against them . Those who follow climate science seem to be concerned with something called carbon emissions , and a key ingredient in this equation is \u201c carbon emissions per capita , \u201d a number that generally tends to be higher in first world countries and lower in others . The United States stood at 16.5 in 2014 , down from 20.8 in 1980 . Mexico \u2019 s carbon emissions per capita , by comparison , was 3.9 in 1980 and 2014 , and has hovered around that number for over three decades . And that \u2019 s actually high compared to other countries whose populace likes to migrate to the United States . Honduras \u2019 \u201c carbon emissions per capita , \u201d for example , stands at a miniscule 1.1 , and Guatemala \u2019 s is even lower at 1 .\nWhat \u2019 s the point ? Well , if population growth is a problem that contributes to climate change , how on earth is shifting ever increasing numbers of the world \u2019 s population from developing to developed countries supposed to help with climate change ?\n\u201c No doubt human population growth is a major contributor to global warming , given that humans use fossil fuels to power their increasingly mechanized lifestyles , \u201d writes Scientific American . \u201c More people means more demand for oil , gas , coal and other fuels mined or drilled from below the Earth \u2019 s surface that , when burned , spew enough carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into the atmosphere to trap warm air inside like a greenhouse . \u201d\nSo , those millions of migrants liberals are so desperate to bring in , all of whom suddenly \u201c blessed \u201d with the ability to consume , and waste , at a greater rate than they ever could have dreamed of sitting in the Third World hellhole from whence they came , actually will contribute even more to the rise in the earth \u2019 s temperature than if they had stayed home . Oh , the irony !\nClimate change . It \u2019 s an issue liberals are supposed to care about , but do they care enough about it to oppose the massive population growth that \u2019 s expected to occur in the United States and Europe over the coming decades thanks to the neverending flow of migrants from impoverished - yet low carbon footprint - Third World nations ?\nOf course not !

Since they\u2019re always going on about it, let\u2019s use some of their own terminology against them.
