Otherwise , he writes , they risk damaging their ability to share the Gospel with the world . Christians have been divided over Trump since he became a serious presidential candidate in 2016 . Now , less than a month away from retirement , Galli wants them to unite against the president .\nI spoke with Galli shortly after his editorial was published this evening . Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity .\nEmma Green : Why did you feel called to publish this editorial ?\nMark Galli : One of my main goals for the last three or four years is to have evangelicals on the left and the right , pro-Trump and anti-Trump , learn to listen to each other , to be caring to one another , to understand one another . I think our unity in Christ is much more important than our fusion in politics .\nI have friends who voted for Trump for strong , prudential reasons . They \u2019 re very much pro-life , very much pro\u2013religious freedom . They said , \u201c Well , we can put up with his moral problems , because he \u2019 s delivering on things that are really important to us. \u201d So , you know , I grant that .\nI don \u2019 t think it was until the impeachment hearings that there was some sort of smoking gun that was just unambiguously clear . The Mueller investigation was so confusing . It was hard to tell what was legal or illegal , moral or immoral . I just don \u2019 t know how that world works . But with the impeachment hearings , it became absolutely clear that he tried to use his power as the president to manipulate a foreign leader into getting dirt on his political enemies . That \u2019 s unconstitutional , and it \u2019 s immoral . So it was kind of a clear moment .\nI \u2019 ve been thinking , in the last week , whether we should address that . I recalled that in the Clinton era and the Nixon era , when it became absolutely clear about the immoral improprieties of the president , we said that this person is no longer fit for office . That was weighing on me , and I thought maybe it was time for us to do this .\nI started with the notion : Okay , we \u2019 re going to do this like CT : \u201c On the one hand .

I \u2019 m just going to say what I think the reality is that we have to open our eyes to .\nGreen : I was struck by how directly you called on your fellow evangelicals to be honest about what you see as Trump \u2019 s misconduct . You wrote , \u201c Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump \u2019 s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency. \u201d That \u2019 s very , very direct .
