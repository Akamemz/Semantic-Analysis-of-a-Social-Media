    "content": "For weeks , President Donald Trump and top advisers like Attorney General William Barr have sought to blame antifa for sporadic violence and rioting during the ongoing Black Lives Matters protests . With little evidence , Trump even threatened to label antifa , an amorphous left-wing movement opposed to fascism , as a domestic terrorist organization . But the president \u2019 s strategy of pinning blame on antifa in quick , broad brushstrokes is undercut not only by constitutional hurdles and conflicting evidence on the ground , but also by a sobering report from his own intelligence officials that calls for an entirely revamped approach to domestic extremism . The analysis from the National Counterterrorism Center , which has not been previously reported , offers an unusually self-critical view of the gaps and weaknesses in combating homegrown terror threats , and it suggests that the focus needs to be on individual actors who break the law , rather than groups . The report raises troubling questions about the government \u2019 s ability to head off a major attack from extremists at home . In stark terms , it depicts a system ill-equipped to deal with the rising threat of domestic extremists because of splintered approaches by different agencies .\nThe report depicts a system ill-equipped to deal with the rising threat of domestic extremists because of splintered approaches by different agencies .\nThe report warned bluntly that \u201c there is no whole-of-government [ domestic terrorism ] threat picture. \u201d Federal officials can not even agree on what to call violent extremists inside the United States , their efforts are \u201c rarely integrated , \u201d and combating the \u201c potent \u201d threat is not a top priority in some agencies , said the report , which grew out of a high-level summit of government officials and outside experts last fall . As a result , intelligence officials are hampered by a \u201c lack of analytic research \u201d and formal threat assessments to draw on in their work , the report said , and that gap in valuable intelligence \u201c in turn reinforces the lack of policymaker prioritization. \u201d The six-page report summarized the key takeaways from a highly unusual two-day conference on domestic terrorism organized last September outside Washington , D.C. , by the National Counterterrorism Center , the FBI , and the Department of Homeland Security . It brought together more than 120 experts on the subject , including officials across the federal government , as well as local law enforcement officers , academics , and private-sector analysts . Joseph Maguire , who was then the acting director of national intelligence , spoke to the group himself and deemed the event a \u201c call to action \u201d to confront the growing domestic terror threat , according to the report . The Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comment on the report , and a spokesperson declined to say what steps intelligence officials had taken in response to the findings . The report from the counterterrorism center , which is part of the DNI \u2019 s office , is dated January of this year and was posted online by the office in March .\nA number of the outside experts invited to participate the conference said that the government \u2019 s acknowledgement of shortcomings in identifying domestic extremists was a significant step by an administration that had shown little interest in the problem . But turnover and tumult among Trump \u2019 s intelligence advisers make it unclear what changes , if any , may take place as a result of the findings . \u201c It \u2019 s true there \u2019 s no whole-of-government approach , and that needs to change , \u201d former Justice Department official Mary McCord , who gave a presentation at the invitation-only conference , said in an interview . \u201c If you \u2019 re going to get serious about thwarting domestic terrorism plots , you \u2019 re going to have to use more tools than we do. \u201d The findings come as intelligence officials have been grappling not only with far-right violence connected to the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests , but also with conflicting messages from Trump and his top advisers about the real source of the violence . Since the protests began , Trump has tried to cast blame on antifa and what he called \u201c a lot of radical left , bad people \u201d for occasional bursts of violence during what have been largely peaceful demonstrations . Beyond threatening to designate antifa as a terrorist organization \u2014 a move constitutional scholars say would likely be illegal \u2014 he went so far as to fuel a baseless conspiracy theory about a 75-year-old Buffalo , New York , protester badly hurt by police , accusing the injured man of being a covert \u201c antifa provocateur. \u201d Rudy Giuliani , the president \u2019 s private counsel and personal adviser , blamed \u201c antifa , Black Lives Matter , the communists , and their allies \u201d for episodes of violence and destruction around the country in an appearance last week on Fox News .\nRudy Giuliani blamed \u201c antifa , Black Lives Matter , the communists , and their allies \u201d for episodes of violence and destruction around the country .\nBarr , meanwhile , declared at the very start of the protests that \u201c the violence instigated and carried out by antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly. \u201d He announced on Friday that he was creating a federal task force to confront \u201c anti-government extremists engaged in indefensible acts of violence designed to undermine public order. \u201d He again pointed the finger at antifa , but this time , he also named a far-right group : supporters of the so-called Boogaloo movement , a white extremist group that envisions a coming \u201c civil war . \u201d\nBut there is little evidence to back up Trump administration claims that antifa is driving the violence . Instead , law enforcement officials on the ground point mainly to the far-right groups \u2014 principally the \u201c Boogaloo Boys \u201d \u2014 for stoking violence and rioting . In Oakland , authorities accused an active-duty Air Force sergeant who declared himself a Boogaloo of ambushing two federal security officers near a protest , killing one and wounding the other . And in Las Vegas , three men aligned with that same white extremist group \u2014 all of them military veterans \u2014 were arrested at a protest and charged with plotting to detonate Molotov cocktails and stoke violence among the crowds of protesters . Even before the Black Lives Matters protests , a string of deadly attacks against minorities by white supremacists \u2014 including the rampage last August at a Walmart in El Paso , Texas , which killed 22 people , most of them Latinos \u2014 had prompted the FBI and DHS to elevate the threat posed by domestic extremists . The agencies put them on a par with foreign-based terrorist groups like the Islamic State and other Islamist extremists , which have been the dominant focus of counterterrorism officials since the September 11 attacks . One of the most alarming far-right plots emerged just last week , and like several earlier episodes , it involved an American soldier .\nFederal prosecutors said that a 22-year-old Army private from Kentucky named Ethan Melzer aligned himself with a violent neo-Nazi group and sent along sensitive military information about deployment schedules to facilitate an attack on his own unit in Turkey . In private chat messages , Meltzer told members of the neo-Nazi group , known as the \u201c RapeWaffen Division \u201d or \u201c Order of the Nine Angles , \u201d that he wanted to inflict mass casualties and start \u201c a new war , \u201d even if it meant he himself might be killed , according to his indictment . The authorities said that Melzer confessed after his arrest last month and \u201c declared himself to be a traitor against the United States whose conduct was tantamount to treason. \u201d Investigators with the FBI and the military appear to have had a confidential source within the neo-Nazi group whom they used to find out about the plot as it was being hatched , according to an unsealed affidavit in the case . But the broad findings from the National Counterterrorism Center report suggest that authorities could be left in the dark about other extremist plots \u2014 and unable to head them off \u2014 without wide changes to the system . Trump himself has shown little inclination to go after domestic extremists , even before the recent racial unrest . In one of his most notorious proclamations , he said there were \u201c very fine people on both sides \u201d at the violent neo-Nazi demonstration in 2017 in Charlottesville , Virginia , and after last year \u2019 s massacre of 49 Muslims at two New Zealand mosques , he rejected the suggestion that white nationalists were a growing global threat , characterizing them instead as \u201c a small group of people that have very , very serious problems. \u201d At the same time , his administration gutted funding for an Obama-era program called Countering Violent Extremism , meant to head off the radicalization of Americans . The latest accusations against Trump of fanning racial tensions came this weekend , when he retweeted a video from Florida that included a supporter yelling \u201c White Power ! \u201d at protesters . The president later took down the post . Given the administration \u2019 s record , \u201c a lot of us were pleasantly surprised that this conference was convened in the first place \u2014 it was overdue , \u201d said Brian Levin , who runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino and helped lead a discussion at the event . \u201c There was a message from the top saying , \u2018 I get it . ' \u201d But that message has now become muddled , Levin and other participants said , after the Trump administration fired both Maguire , the acting intelligence chief , and Russ Travers , the acting head of the counterterrorism center , within weeks of each other earlier this year . Trump was reportedly furious with Maguire \u2014 and questioned his loyalty \u2014 for allowing an aide to give a classified congressional briefing about Russian meddling in the 2020 election . Darryl Johnson , a former senior analyst on far-right extremism at DHS , said in an interview he was optimistic after taking part in the conference that federal officials were determined to develop a more thorough approach to domestic terrorism . But with the recent changeover among intelligence officials , \u201c we \u2019 re back to square one , spinning our wheels , \u201d he said .
