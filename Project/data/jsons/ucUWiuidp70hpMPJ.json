The act requires a president to notify Congress publicly of the national emergency and to report every six months . The law also says the president must renew the emergency every year , simply by notifying Congress .\nThe House and Senate can revoke a declaration by majority vote , but it would take a two-thirds vote by each house to override an expected presidential veto .\nBeyond that , the law does n't say what constitutes a national emergency or impose any other limits on the president .\nThe Department of Defense ( DOD ) released a statement saying the president invoked sections 12302 , 284 ( b ) ( 7 ) , and 2808 of Title X of the U.S. Code .\nSection 12302 authorizes `` involuntary activation '' of reserve troops to perform a `` federal mission at the direction of the secretary of defense . '' Section 284 ( b ) ( 7 ) allows the DOD to support counter-drug activities of other federal agencies , such as the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) `` with the construction of roads , fences , and lighting '' to disrupt drug trafficking .\nSection 2808 of Title X authorizes the Defense secretary to decide whether barriers are necessary to support the actions of the armed services , and to redirect unobligated military construction funds to construct the border barriers .\nThe broad grant of discretion to the president could make it hard to persuade courts to rule that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority in declaring a border emergency .\n`` He 's the one who gets to make the call . We ca n't second-guess it , '' said John Eastman , a professor of constitutional law at the Chapman University School of Law .\nCourts often are reluctant to look beyond the justifications the president included in his proclamation , Ohio State University law professor Peter Shane said on a call organized by the liberal American Constitution Society .\nBut other legal experts said the facts are powerfully arrayed against the president . They include government statistics showing a decades-long decline in illegal border crossings , as well as Mr. Trump 's rejection of a deal last year that would have provided more than the nearly $ 1.4 billion he got for border security in the budget agreement he signed Thursday .\nOpponents of the declaration also are certain to use Mr. Trump 's own words at his Rose Garden news conference Friday to argue that there is no emergency on the border .\n`` I could do the wall over a longer period of time , '' Mr. Trump said . `` I did n't need to do this , but I 'd rather do it much faster . ''\nACLU executive director Anthony Romero said Mr. Trump 's remarks are an admission that there is no national emergency . `` He just grew impatient and frustrated with Congress , '' Romero said in a statement .\nHowever , trying to turn the president 's words against him failed in the challenge to Mr. Trump 's ban on travel to the United States by citizens of several mostly Muslim countries .
