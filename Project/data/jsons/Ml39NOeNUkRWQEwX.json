    "content": "\u201c D OCTORS NEED three qualifications : to be able to lie and not get caught ; to pretend to be honest ; and to cause death without guilt. \u201d So wrote Jean Froissart , a diarist of the Middle Ages , after an outbreak of bubonic plague in the 14th century . Fake news then meant rumours that the plague could be cured by sitting in a sewer , eating decade-old treacle or ingesting arsenic .\nThe \u201c infodemic \u201d around covid-19 , declared by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) in February , is not the world \u2019 s first outbreak of misinformation . This time the myths include the notion that the disease can be cured by drinking methanol , which has led to more than 700 deaths in Iran , and that it is spread by 5 G transmitters , which has convinced arsonists in Britain to carry out more than 90 attacks on phone towers . Just as the virus lodges in people \u2019 s lungs , dangerous ideas are infecting their minds .\nOne big difference between the infodemics of the 1300s and 2020 is the rapid worldwide transmission of today \u2019 s nonsense , enabled by the internet . In March a poll by Gallup International of 28 countries in four continents found that in all of them , at least 16 % \u2014and as many as 58 % \u2014of people thought covid-19 was being deliberately spread ( see chart 1 ) . A clip of a film called \u201c Plandemic \u201d , which claims that a shadowy elite started the outbreak for profit , was uploaded on May 4th ; within a week it had been seen 8m times and its star , Judy Mikovits , had topped Amazon \u2019 s bestseller list .\nSocial media enable people to share true news as well as the fake sort . But the fabulists seem to be winning . A study published in Nature in May found that , although pro-vaccine Facebook users outnumber anti-vaccine ones , the anti-vaxxers are better at forging links with non-aligned groups like school parents \u2019 associations , so their number is growing faster . Among Americans , exposure to social media is associated with a greater likelihood of believing that the government created the virus or that officials exaggerate its seriousness , according to a recent paper in the Harvard Kennedy School \u2019 s Misinformation Review . Broadcasters in many countries need a licence and must convince regulators that they try to report the news truthfully . Few such constraints apply to the internet . In April Britain \u2019 s broadcasting watchdog , Ofcom , censured a tiny TV station called London Live for airing part of an interview with David Icke , a conspiracy theorist who believes the pandemic is a hoax . The broadcast had been watched by only 80,000 people . Yet at the time of Ofcom \u2019 s ruling 6m had viewed the full interview on YouTube , which is outside Ofcom \u2019 s jurisdiction . YouTube has since taken the video down , along with many others . Section 230 of America \u2019 s Communications Decency Act absolves tech firms of responsibility in that country for fact-checking uploaded content . But President Donald Trump wants to change this ( see article ) . Even if he is blocked by the courts , public opinion favours more intervention . In America 84 % say social networks should delete posts that they suspect contain inaccurate information about covid-19 . Half that number say they should do so without confirming the posts are false . Tech firms have thus begun to add warnings to false information and signposts to reliable sources . Covid-19 may seem a relatively straightforward subject on which to play censor . Compared with , say , politics , \u201c it \u2019 s easier to set policies that are a little more black and white and take a much harder line , \u201d Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook \u2019 s boss , told the New York Times in March . Yet it is proving tricky . The science is changing rapidly . In February America \u2019 s surgeon-general tweeted that facemasks were \u201c NOT effective in preventing general public from catching coronavirus \u201d . Now he says they are .\nWorse , any hope that the pandemic would be politically uncontentious has evaporated . In March Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had no problem taking down \u201c things like \u2018 You can cure this by drinking bleach. \u2019 I mean , that \u2019 s just in a different class \u201d . Yet weeks later Mr Trump suggested it might help to inject disinfectant . Facebook , Twitter and YouTube have removed videos posted by Brazil \u2019 s president , Jair Bolsonaro , declaring hydroxychloroquine an effective treatment . So far clips of Mr Trump praising ( and even claiming to take ) \u201c the hydroxy \u201d remain up . The firms say the difference is that Mr Trump stopped short of saying that the drug was a proven cure .\nJust as misinformation is not new , nor is its political use . In 1964 an essay by a historian , Richard Hofstadter , on the \u201c paranoid style \u201d in American politics described \u201c the sense of heated exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy \u201d running through everything from 18th-century protests against the Illuminati to the anti-Masonic movement . Yet whereas Hofstadter argued that the paranoid style came as easily to those on the left as on the right\u2014for instance , he cited the rumours of a slave-owners \u2019 plot that were propagated by some abolitionists\u2014today \u2019 s infodemic appears to be spreading more easily among the world \u2019 s conservatives than its liberals .\nIn America the Pew Research Centre found in March that 30 % of Republicans believed the virus was created intentionally , nearly twice the share of Democrats . Last month a poll by YouGov found that 44 % of Republicans think Bill Gates wants to use covid-19 vaccines to implant microchips in people ; 19 % of Democrats agree . In France a poll by Ifop found that 40 % of those who support Marine Le Pen \u2019 s National Rally ( once the National Front ) believed that the virus was made by design , twice the share among backers of the far-left Unsubmissive France party . Supporters of the Dutch right-populist Freedom Party and the Forum for Democracy ( F v D ) are 40 % more likely than backers of the far-left Socialist Party to say covid-19 is a biological weapon .\nWilder conspiracy theories aside , conservatives also seem more likely than liberals to question the official line on the pandemic . In late March , with Britain freshly locked down , a quarter of Tories but only 15 % of Labour supporters believed that covid-19 was \u201c just like the flu \u201d .\nThe reluctance of so many conservatives to believe the conventional narrative of covid-19 is part of a more general suspicion of mainstream sources of information in some places . In America there is a yawning partisan gap in trust ( see chart 2 ) . The widest gulf concerns journalists , the next academics . These professions have long been conservative targets . Rush Limbaugh , an American talk-show host , speaks of the \u201c four corners of deceit \u201d : the media , scientists , academia and the government .\nSuch language is echoed by European populists of the right . Thierry Baudet , leader of the F v D , declared last year that \u201c we \u2019 re being destroyed by the people who should protect us and undermined by our universities , by our journalists. \u201d He has set up a \u201c hotline \u201d to report left-wing academics , and scoffs that the Dutch public broadcaster \u201c obediently nods for the powers that be \u201d . In France Ms Le Pen claims that \u201c the government has been the biggest provider of fake news since the start of this [ covid ] crisis. \u201d And in Britain , Brexiteers have questioned the impartiality of journalists , academics and civil servants , their attitude summed up by then justice secretary Michael Gove \u2019 s remark that people \u201c have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong \u201d . British Conservatives have less faith than others in most of the media , as well as in international institutions . In April an Opinium poll found they were twice as likely as Labour voters to mistrust Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the head of the WHO . Elite-bashing is hardly unique to conservatives . Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador , Mexico \u2019 s populist left-wing president , continually lays into the media . So did Labour \u2019 s former leader , Jeremy Corbyn , who talked darkly about an \u201c establishment \u201d that mysteriously kept causing him to lose elections . Democrats are likelier than Republicans to believe that 9/11 was an inside job . And the left is partial to corporate conspiracies , including the myth that AIDS was invented by Big Pharma and the CIA . One prominent peddler of covid-19 myths , according to NewsGuard , which vets sites for accuracy , is @ OrganicLife , whose tweets combine vegan nut-milk recipes with paranoia about 5 G transmitters . Conspiracy beliefs are associated with ideological extremism of any variety , argues Karen Douglas , an expert on conspiracy theories at the University of Kent . Yet she says there is an \u201c asymmetry \u201d . People on the right believe in them more often , and entertain a broader range of theories , particularly those that accuse the other \u201c side \u201d of plotting , whether that be left-wingers , foreigners or other groups . Structural shifts may explain why conservative voters seem to be more prone to the infodemic , and why conservative leaders have more reason\u2014and are more likely\u2014to undermine reliable sources . For one thing , conservatives \u2019 complaints that elites are not on their side have become more plausible . In many countries the old left-right political divide , based on economics , has been replaced by a liberal-conservative split , based on culture . This largely pits liberal graduates against conservative school-leavers . And elites\u2014whether in the media , the civil service , science or academia\u2014are dominated by graduates . This doesn \u2019 t necessarily make them partial . But when Brexiteers complain that the civil service is a nest of Remainers , or Republicans growl that America \u2019 s universities are stuffed with liberals , they are right .\nConservatives have responded by tuning in to their own media sources , which have found that there is money to be made in amplifying their fears . American talk-radio punctuates paranoid chat with ads for dubious health remedies ( Alex Jones , a Texas-based radio host , was recently ordered to stop selling toothpaste which he claimed \u201c kills the whole SARS -corona family at point-blank range \u201d ) . Cable channels such as Fox News and websites like Breitbart have drawn audiences by bringing fringe theories into the mainstream .\nMost recently , social networks \u2019 algorithms have steered people towards polarising content , which is more likely to provoke \u201c engagement \u201d and thus generate ad impressions . In 2018 an internal report at Facebook warned that users were being pointed to divisive material . Yet plans to highlight less controversial posts\u2014a project dubbed \u201c Eat Your Veggies \u201d \u2014were sidelined , partly because of concerns that the changes would affect conservative users more than others , according to the Wall Street Journal . Some 16 % of Americans get their covid-19 news directly from the White House ; three-quarters of those who do so think the media have exaggerated the seriousness of the pandemic .\nAnother cause of conservative mistrust is that , in some countries , the electoral system gives conservative politicians a particular incentive to encourage polarisation . Liberals tend to be concentrated in cities ; conservatives are more spread out . In winner-takes-all systems , this puts liberal parties at a disadvantage , as they pile up huge majorities in cities while conservative parties win more seats by lower margins elsewhere . In America this means the Republicans can win the electoral college with a minority of the popular vote ( as they did in 2000 and 2016 ) . In Britain it means Brexit supporters are in the majority in nearly two-thirds of constituencies but make up only about half of voters . The upshot , argues Ezra Klein in a new book on America , \u201c Why We \u2019 re Polarised \u201d , is that ultra-partisanship works better for conservatives . Liberals have to win votes from moderates ; conservatives can prevail by just getting out their base . As politics becomes more polarised , energising the base gets easier , and winning over moderates harder .\nThe lessons from history are gloomy . Hofstadter believed that political paranoia \u201c may be a persistent psychic phenomenon , more or less constantly affecting a modest minority of the population. \u201d But , he warned , \u201c certain historical catastrophes or frustrations may be conducive to the release of such psychic energies , and to situations in which they can more readily be built into mass movements or political parties. \u201d Like the Iraq war and the global financial crisis , the pandemic may prove to be exactly that kind of catastrophe . \u25a0\nCorrection ( June 8th , 2020 ) : The poll cited in the third paragraph was by Gallup International , not Gallup as we originally stated . The two are separate organisations .",
