Bush . The TV cameras panned over the pair sitting together , apparently in the midst of a friendly exchange , and on social media , people erupted into outrage .\nEllen is a trailblazer who taught middle America not to be afraid of lesbians . Most famously , she came out of the closet in 1997 while still the star of a primetime network sitcom , and weathered both the ensuing controversy and her show \u2019 s cancellation to survive and thrive in Hollywood .\nGeorge W. Bush is the architect of the Iraq War who built a large part of his appeal on the idea that middle America should absolutely be afraid of lesbians . Notably , he supported a constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman , and he opposed classifying crimes against gay people as hate crimes . So what , asked progressive observers , was Ellen doing palling around with Bush ?\nLiberals have literally rehabilitated George Bush from the war criminal that killed over one million Iraqis based on lies , to the man that passes Michelle Obama candy , and hangs out with Ellen DeGeneres on weekends . \u2014 Kevin Thee Donkey ( @ swallowit_ ) October 8 , 2019\nOn her talk show on Tuesday , Ellen presented a very Ellen-branded defense of her actions to those she described as \u201c people who were mad. \u201d She was , she told her audience , just being kind .\n\u201c I \u2019 m friends with George Bush . In fact , I \u2019 m friends with a lot of people who don \u2019 t share the same beliefs that I have , \u201d Ellen said , during a segment that ran nearly four minutes long . She noted that while she personally is anti-fur , plenty of her friends wear furs .\n\u201c Just because I don \u2019 t agree with someone on everything doesn \u2019 t mean that I \u2019 m not going to be friends with them , \u201d Ellen concluded . \u201c When I say , \u2018 Be kind to one another , \u2019 I don \u2019 t mean only the people that think the same way that you do . I mean , \u2018 Be kind to everyone , it doesn \u2019 t matter . \u2019 \u201d\nYes , that was me at the Cowboys game with George W. Bush over the weekend . Here \u2019 s the whole story . pic.twitter.com/AYiwY5gTIS \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres ( @ TheEllenShow ) October 8 , 2019\nThat \u2019 s the kind of speech Ellen has been making for most of the time that she \u2019 s been famous . The whole Ellen DeGeneres thing is performative kindness \u2014 or , more specifically , niceness \u2014 that can be directed at anybody .\nDespite persistent tabloid rumors that Ellen is not particularly nice to work with , once the cameras are rolling , any kind of celebrity can drop by Ellen \u2019 s talk show \u2014 politicians , actors , viral YouTube stars \u2014 and she \u2019 ll be aggressively nice , beaming and sunny and joyous , until her guest reflects Ellen \u2019 s sunniness back out to the audience and they , too , appear to be nice . That \u2019 s why Ellen the TV show exists : to make celebrity guests look good , and to let audience bask in that goodness , in the name of entertainment .\nIn that context , Ellen \u2019 s friendship with Bush might appear to be more of the same : more of the niceness that she is famous for performing at all of her guests , no matter who they are . And a few years ago , she might have been able to use her brand to sway public opinion to her side . But in 2019 , Ellen \u2019 s niceness is no longer playing to her audience as an unalloyed good .\nIn our current political moment , niceness no longer appears to be a cure-all . And uncritical niceness may no longer be a viable brand , even for someone as good at wielding it as Ellen is .\nFor some people , Ellen \u2019 s friendship with Bush is a betrayal of her legacy as a lesbian icon\nWhile Ellen \u2019 s \u201c be kind \u201d speech was met with plenty of support from fellow celebrities on social media ( \u201c Thank you for this important reminder , Ellen ! \u201d tweeted Reese Witherspoon ) , many of the civilians in the room were less than convinced by her logic .\n\u201c Being nice to Bush means in turn disrespecting those whose lives were destroyed by his disastrous administration , \u201d wrote Naomi LaChance at Splinter News . \u201c You literally can not be kind to everyone . You have to choose a side ! Ellen certainly has . \u201d\n\u201c DeGeneres betrays her political significance as an openly gay entertainer and a prominent LGBTQ advocate through her friendship with Bush , \u201d wrote Justin Charity at the Ringer .\n\u201c When one person has historically believed other people should not have the same basic rights as another , it \u2019 s hard to treat these differences as benign\u2014especially when that person once exercised their power to help make their beliefs a reality , \u201d wrote Laura Bradley at Vanity Fair .\nEllen weathered a similar controversy earlier this year . After Kevin Hart stepped down from hosting the Oscars in the midst of outrage over some of his old homophobic jokes , Ellen brought him onto her show and urged him to ignore \u201c the haters . \u201d\n\u201c Don \u2019 t let those people win \u2014 host the Oscars , \u201d she told him . She announced that she had already called the Film Academy to pledge her support to Hart .\n\u201c DeGeneres could have shared her platform with dozens of other comedians in the queer community instead of allowing Hart to further a narrative in which he is the victim ( rather than the people he referred to [ using a homophobic slur ] over and over online ) , \u201d wrote Bridget Read at Vogue .\n\u201c Both DeGeneres and Hart , in this conversation , were in positions of power to create a tangible change in our culture about responsibility , liability , humor , acceptance , and harm , \u201d wrote Kevin Fallon at the Daily Beast . \u201c It should have been the teaching moment so many were waiting for . How is it possible then that they both made the situation worse ? \u201d\nEllen \u2019 s pleas for Hart went unheard by the Academy Powers That Be , and the 2019 Oscars went forward with no host at all . Her formidable ability to reflect her own niceness and good reputation onto a problematic celebrity and rehabilitate them through her endorsement had failed \u2014 just as her ability to smooth over a controversy with calls for kindness seems to be failing this week .\nIn many ways , it feels as though niceness is no longer enough , as though it might perhaps even be slightly immoral . In this age of Donald Trump and # MeToo and apocalyptic climate change and gun violence and all the other things that make our futures seem ever more uncertain , and as though those in power are ever more unqualified to help us \u2014 do we even want to be nice to the powerful anymore ? Is uncritical niceness to people who have made the world a worse place a good and admirable thing ?\nBut the rising sense that niceness might at times be immoral stands in sharp opposition to all the things that Ellen has traditionally been very good at : the ability to be charming and likable and kind to everyone , no matter who they are or what they \u2019 ve done . That \u2019 s what Ellen supporters like Reese Witherspoon are applauding , and it \u2019 s what Ellen has built her defense on .\nWe \u2019 re in a pop culture moment that loves wholesomeness . That doesn \u2019 t mean we love niceness , too .\nRight now , popular culture is in love with all that is wholesome : cute animal pictures , wholesome memes , wholesome movies , the general idea of friends being nice to each other , and just about anything that might give us a rest from the unending bleakness and horror of these , Our Troubled Times .\nBut pop culture \u2019 s love affair with wholesomeness does not bring with it a renewed appreciation for niceness , or at least not for niceness as Ellen is currently using it . And that is because our current thirst for wholesomeness is pointed in a different direction than Ellen \u2019 s much-lauded niceness is .\nWholesomeness as we are currently using the word is about people who are not in any particular position of power being kind to one another . The first post filed under BuzzFeed \u2019 s wholesome tag is a video titled \u201c 9 Best Things About Being Filipino-American , \u201d featuring affectionate Filipino in-group stereotyping . The wholesome-est movie of 2018 , To All the Boys I \u2019 ve Loved Before , was about a bunch of teenagers who have no platform or power besides their middle-class wealth but who consistently do nice things for each other , like buying each other yogurt drinks and acting as pillows for each other during naps .\nThis wholesomeness is aspirational . It \u2019 s both optimistic and comforting . It \u2019 s about celebrating small moments of kindness that act as a balm , a refuge for normal people without power as we all try to survive the apocalyptic scourge of what those in power are doing to the rest of us : behaving in a way that either contributes to or neglects to show enough concern for the melting polar ice caps , the rise in hate crimes , the collapse of civil rights .\nBut the niceness that Ellen DeGeneres is celebrating in her friendship with George W. Bush \u2014 the niceness that she is extraordinarily skilled at performing \u2014 is not about kindness for the powerless . It \u2019 s about kindness for the powerful , for the people who helped to set in place the problems the rest of us are currently living in . It \u2019 s about avoiding messy social confrontations and awkwardness by being nice to those who have made the world a worse place .\nThe debate over Ellen \u2019 s niceness as an entertainer and celebrity is a close cousin to the \u201c civility \u201d debate that periodically roils the political world : the question of whether it is politically more effective for the left to \u201c be civil \u201d to members of the Trump administration , or whether publicly confronting some of those members \u2014 like Sarah Huckabee Sanders , who was denied service at a restaurant in an act of political protest in 2018 \u2014 might perhaps be the morally correct and politically viable way to go .\nAnd while calls for civility remain prevalent , it \u2019 s no longer considered inarguably correct that civility always wins . As Nicole Hemmer wrote for \u2588\u2588\u2588 last year , the great victories of the civil rights movement came only after a combined attack of both civil and uncivil strategies .\n\u201c The current calls for civility ignore this longer history , \u201d Hemmer argued . \u201c They overlook the way civility has been used as a cudgel , providing moral cover for immoral laws . And they fail to grapple with the limits of what really can be achieved by civility . \u201d\nFor much of Ellen \u2019 s audience in 2019 , niceness is beginning to look the way civility has begun to look in the Trump era : like a desire to prioritize social norms above all else , even if that means ignoring or minimizing what is good and what is right . And if that \u2019 s what niceness means today , then not even a celebrity as charming as Ellen can make it viable as a brand again .",
