She later called the women \u201c extraordinary \u201d , and praised their optimism in finding a new life after prison . But the moment that she dwelled on most was a visit to the silkscreening room , where inmates were cutting rectangles of fabric and pushing paint through the material . The imprisoned women were manufacturing American flags .\nLater , in front out of an audience of criminal justice reform advocates in Washington DC , Harris would share that story . She gestured out the window to the American flags flying above the nation \u2019 s capital , some of which , she suggested , may have been made in Chowchilla .\n2020 vision ? Kamala Harris oversight role gives Democrats a new rising star Read more\n\u201c Isn \u2019 t it part of who we are in America that we believe in second chances ? \u201d she asked .\nSix months into the presidency of Donald Trump , Republicans are flailing amid efforts to erase health insurance for tens of millions of Americans . Democrats are already looking eagerly forward to the 2020 presidential race \u2013 and a new candidate to lead them .\nHowever , the Democratic party , too , is riven with disagreement . Does its salvation lie in maintaining a centrist position , or taking strong shift left , toward Bernie Sanders \u2019 s unapologetic embrace of universal healthcare , a higher minimum wage , and tuition-free college ? The party faces frustration from voters who feel it is too beholden to corporate interests .\nHarris is seeing increasing presidential buzz , making headlines for her tough questioning of the attorney general , Jeff Sessions , during a Senate hearing , and then reportedly wowing big Democratic donors at an event in the Hamptons this month .\nIn an America of emboldened racism , where the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan recently held a rally in a college town and was confronted with more than a thousand furious counter-protesters , the Democratic party is also still negotiating its own racial politics . The party is caught between those who are moving to woo back white working-class voters who defected to Trump , and those who argue that it would be a smarter investment to focus on mobilizing African American voters , whose reported turnout dropped in 2016 .\nThere \u2019 s a long list of potential 2020 contenders , many of them , including Harris , making the obligatory claims that they are focused on their current jobs and not thinking ahead to the White House . Sanders , 75 , still has enthusiastic backers , and has been touring the country , as has Senator Elizabeth Warren , the progressive firebrand from Massachusetts . Warren has long been enough of a challenge to Trump that he gave her a demeaning nickname during his campaign : Pocahontas , a reference to her reported Native American descent .\nThe former vice-president Joe Biden , who chose not to run for president in 2016 , has a new book out , Promise Me Dad , about the year after his son Beau \u2019 s death . He has been blunt in his frustration at what he sees as the Democrats \u2019 failure to channel the economic anxieties of the middle-class : \u201c You didn \u2019 t hear a single solitary sentence in the last campaign about that guy working on the assembly line making $ 60,000 a year and a wife making $ 32,000 as a hostess in restaurant . \u201d\nHarris is a comparative unknown on the national stage \u2013 one recent poll found that 53 % of voters had never heard of her . But she offers an interesting solution to the problem facing the Democratic party .\nHarris is a leader whose success inspires young women of color , who see themselves in her . At the same time , her rhetoric and positions are often scrupulously centrist . She likes to talk about how her civil rights activist family was appalled when she decided to become a prosecutor . Rather than try to challenge America \u2019 s continuing love of law and order politics , which fueled mass incarceration and helped Trump win the White House , Harris is trying to reshape that instinct , pivoting from \u201c tough on crime \u201d to \u201c smart on crime \u201d , the title of her 2009 book .\nAt Women Unshackled , a criminal justice reform conference in Washington DC this week , Harris was treated like a star . The conference , which planned for 300 attendees , attracted double that number and she was mobbed in the hallway by enthusiastic young women . Vogue magazine \u2019 s website ran a photo of the senator surrounded by jubilant young faces , with women crowding around her , arms outstretched to get a photograph on their phones .\nOutside in the hallway after her criminal justice speech , Harris told a reporter for Yahoo news that Democrats needed to have a message \u201c much bigger \u201d than resisting Donald Trump .\n\u201c The issues are not simple , so the message is not going to be simple , \u201d she said , rejecting any \u201c monosyllabic \u201d slogan , \u201c but essentially it \u2019 s about telling the American public we see them . \u201d\nCriminal justice reform , one of Harris \u2019 key issues , is also one of the Democratic party \u2019 s failures . Clinton was attacked for her role in boosting the Democratic party \u2019 s harsh , pro-incarceration policies , part of a push toward mass incarceration that devastated black families and that many Americans now see as a shameful mistake .\nYoung activists confronted Clinton over comments made in 1996 interpreted as an attack on young African Americans .
