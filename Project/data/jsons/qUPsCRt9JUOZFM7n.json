''\nSpeaking at a meeting of Arctic Circle nations in Anchorage , Alaska , Obama outlined the science behind his urgent call for climate action , and stressed that failure , this time , is not an option . \u201c On this issue , of all issues , there is such a thing as being too late , '' he said . `` That moment is almost upon us . ''\nThe warning rings frighteningly true , as time is indeed running out not just for an Obama climate deal , but for any climate deal . As talks began last year in Lima , Peru for a draft of the agreement intended to be signed and sealed this December in Paris , experts reminded the delegates that the world has already used up nearly two-thirds of its carbon budget -- the amount of carbon we can continue to pour into the atmosphere while still having a chance at keeping warming below two degrees Celsius . It 's a limit , some experts contend , that we 've already in effect blown past . Yet with the day of reckoning nearing , negotiations are n't where they should be , to say the least : fewer than 60 countries , representing just 61 percent of the world 's emissions , have submitted their goals for cutting back , many of which are considered to be not nearly ambitious enough . In June , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon complained that talks were moving `` at a snail 's pace . ''\nObama emphasized that the U.S. is on track to meet its submitted goal -- a 26 to 28 percent decrease in emissions from 2005 levels by 2025 -- thanks in large part to the finalization of the EPA 's new regulations for coal-fired power plants . There is , unfortunately , still reason to doubt the sincerity of the president 's commitment to the radical action he says is needed . Obama continues to press the fact that climate change is not only real -- deniers , he scoffed , are `` on their own shrinking island '' -- but a crisis that we 're experiencing right now , a point driven home by his decision to speak from Alaska , where the impacts of climate change are already taking a significant toll . Yet at the same time , his administration has allowed Shell to go ahead and drill for oil in the Arctic , a decision that to many feels irreconcilable with his insistence that the world must address the key causes of climate change as quickly as possible -- not to mention the contention , among experts , that our best hope of preventing climate catastrophe requires us to leave all of the Arctic 's oil and gas reserves in the ground .\n`` I am not trying to suggest that there are not going to be difficult transitions that we all have to make , '' Obama conceded .
