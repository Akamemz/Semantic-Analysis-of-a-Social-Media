The records obtained by the Justice Department listed incoming and outgoing calls , and the duration of each call , for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters , general AP office numbers in New York , Washington and Hartford , Conn. , and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery , according to attorneys for the AP . In all , the government seized those records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012 .
