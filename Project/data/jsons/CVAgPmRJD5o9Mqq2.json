    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump is lashing out in all directions as the fallout from his summit with Vladimir Putin becomes ever more toxic , the Russia investigation grinds on with no end in sight , and his frustration boils over on a lack of progress on North Korea .\nThe tensions reached a new level Sunday night when the President issued an all-caps threat against Iranian President Hassan Rouhani , who had warned the US that war with Tehran would be the `` mother of all wars . '' Trump tweeted that Iran would `` suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before '' if its government again threatened the US , immediately ratcheting up tensions .\nExacerbating a sense of a White House under siege is the President 's full-out assault on his former lawyer Michael Cohen , who recorded a conversation with Trump about a payment to a former Playboy model who alleges she had an affair with the former real estate tycoon before he entered politics .\nThe controversies raging around the Oval Office underline how the President is increasingly taking control of his own defense and is willing to dictate high-risk political and legal strategies . But his incessant and often false attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation also give the impression of someone who fears its ultimate conclusions and is unsettled that his fate may be out of his hands .\nThe most surreal aspect of the latest lurches of this unparalleled presidency is the intensifying public debate over the once implausible idea that the President of the United States is compromised by a hostile foreign power .\nBut Trump is vehemently defending the summit in Helsinki , Finland , seven days ago as a great success , despite lingering mystery over what went on in his private one-on-one meeting with Putin and amid uproar over his invitation to the Russian leader for a second summit at the White House .\nHe is also facing increasing scrutiny about the results of another major summit : his encounter with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last month , which ended with Trump declaring he had solved the isolated nation 's nuclear threat .\nSince then , Pyongyang has returned to its characteristic strategy of diplomatic obfuscation and delay . The Washington Post reported Sunday that despite publicly talking up the success of the summit , Trump was fuming to aides in private that there had not been more dramatic steps forward in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula .\nCNN 's Kevin Liptak reported Sunday that according to a US official , the President had indeed registered frustration , but he was also convinced that North Korea 's continued suspension of nuclear and missile tests was a positive achievement .\nOne week on from the Putin summit , no one can stop talking about it . And Trump 's defiance and failure to publicly rebuke the Russian leader in Finland over election interference is spurring unusual criticism from Republicans .\n`` It can be proven beyond any evidentiary burden that Russia is not our friend and they tried to attack us in 2016 , '' Gowdy said . `` So the President either needs to rely on the people that he has chosen to advise him , or those advisers need to reevaluate whether or not they can serve in this administration . But the disconnect can not continue . The evidence is overwhelming , and the President needs to say that and act like it . ''\nStill , on Sunday , Trump appeared to return to a previous position that Russia 's election interference was a story dreamed up by Democrats to excuse Hillary Clinton 's defeat -- despite saying in a scripted statement last week that he held Putin personally responsible for it .\n`` So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election . Why did n't he do something about it ? Why did n't he tell our campaign ? Because it is all a big hoax , that 's why , and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win ! ! ! '' Trump tweeted .\nThe intensifying saga of presidential misdirection , recriminations and accusations is a sure sign that the corrosive impact on American politics triggered by the Russian election intrigue is worsening . The odds of it ending in any manner that does not deepen political divides are lengthening by the day .\nThe question of why the President is acting in a way that often seems to further Russian goals -- for example in his attacks on allied leaders and institutions like NATO -- is driving growing concerns about his attitude toward Russia and explains why the controversy over the Helsinki summit is showing no signs of ebbing .\n`` I think there 's no ignoring the fact that for whatever reason , this President acts like he 's compromised , '' Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , said on ABC News ' `` This Week . ''\n`` There is simply no other way to explain why he would side with this Kremlin former KGB officer rather than his own intelligence agencies , '' he said .\nBut Tom Bossert , the former White House homeland security adviser , said on the same show that suggestions that Trump was compromised by Russia were a `` cheap shot . ''\nContrasting Putin 's background as a former KGB agent who uses `` penny-ante spy tactics '' with Trump 's as a former businessman , Bossert said , `` We spend our time trying to have productive meetings with foreign leaders . All the rest of this speculation and smoke is meant to undermine the President . It 's domestic partisan political concern mixed with some legitimate need to throw our intelligence forces against the prevention of spying and interfering in the United States . ''\nWhatever Trump 's motivation , there is also anxiety in Washington over his strategy of getting closer to Putin , even though most observers understand the necessity of communication between the world 's two top nuclear powers at a time of dangerously ruptured ties with Moscow .\n`` ( Putin ) is not interested in better relations with the United States , '' Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said on CNN 's `` State of the Union , '' implicitly contradicting Trump 's rationale for engaging the Russian leader . `` I think he walked away from that a long time ago .
