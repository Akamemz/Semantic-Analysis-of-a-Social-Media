Despite some indications that special counsel Robert Mueller could be wrapping up, there has been no official word from the Justice Department confirming that's so.\n\nBut the prospect for the end of the Russia investigation, or at least the end of this phase, has resurrected many questions about where the story stands and what could happen next.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is Mueller investigating?\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in the spring of 2017 to establish whether there were any links or coordination between President Trump's campaign and the Russians who attacked the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThat there was an attack is no longer in dispute, and Mueller has shed a great deal of light upon it.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged Russian intelligence officers with allegedly launching cyberattacks against U.S. political targets and stealing embarrassing material and then releasing it to cause havoc.\n\nOther Russians have been charged with using social media agitation to amplify controversy inside the United States and to pit Americans against one another.\n\nInvestigators also appear to have established that Russians or their intermediaries were in contact with a number of Americans in Trump's orbit. Some of them offered help or to build backchannel relationships.\n\nWhat does Trump say?\n\nThe president goes back and forth about what he accepts about Russia's election interference, but he has been consistent about calling the Mueller investigation a \"hoax\" or a \"witch hunt,\" part of a conspiracy by disgruntled Justice Department insiders who are out to get him.\n\nTrump says he didn't know in 2016, for example, that Russians were making overtures to people on his campaign, including one that resulted in a delegation meeting at Trump Tower with Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nSkeptics argue it's implausible that Trump couldn't have known about the Russian outreach, including that meeting, and have pointed to the fact that one month after it took place, Trump asked Russia \u2014 \"if you're listening\" \u2014 to try to locate Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's missing emails.\n\nMueller's investigators have since established that Russian hackers redoubled their cyberattacks against Clinton that very day. So far it isn't clear whether there was any connection to Trump's comments or whether there were other ties with Trump.\n\nWhen could we learn whether there was a connection?\n\nThere's no official word as to when the special counsel's office may conclude its work and, if it does, whether it might release findings other than those that have been included in the public court cases.\n\nSo Mueller's report might not be public?\n\nCorrect \u2014 and there might not even be a \"report.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's regulations call for Mueller's office to give the attorney general a \"confidential\" report when he completes his work, but new Attorney General William Barr doesn't have to release it.\n\nOther regulations call upon Barr to make certain notices to the House and Senate judiciary committees, but not for Barr to give them, or the public, the work product from Mueller.\n\nBarr has said he supports the idea of making public a report from Mueller's office, consistent with regulations and the law.
