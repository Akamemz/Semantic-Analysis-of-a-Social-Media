    "content": "The last two years of fire and fury have not been kind to allies of Third Way , the centrist Democratic think tank that preaches a middle-of-the-road strategy focused on winning over independent voters and wooing back former Barack Obama supporters who swung to Donald Trump in 2016 . These days it \u2019 s almost impossible to avoid resigned jokes among friends of the group about just how out of favor their Clintonphile politics supposedly are with the Democrats \u2019 base . Late last week , as I walked into a hotel basement ballroom where Third Way was convening some of the country \u2019 s leading center-left officials in Columbus , Ohio , a strategist in attendance peered up from the Hilton pastries and texted me , wryly : \u201c Welcome to the Wall St Wing of the Democratic Party . \u201d\nBack in Washington , Bernie Sanders and his newfound allies had laid claim to the party , tugging its leaders left as quickly as possible while pointing to 2016 \u2019 s result as evidence that they were right all along . Just a few weeks earlier , Sanders , who of course lost that year \u2019 s presidential primary to Hillary Clinton , declared at a D.C. book party for his campaign manager , \u201c In many ways , we did win the election. \u201d The book is called How Bernie Won .\nBut in Ohio , more than 200 centrist lawmakers , operatives , and donors \u2014 including some former Hillary Clinton aides and backers \u2014 flew in from 20 of the country \u2019 s most politically relevant states to listen to a lot of speeches and panels and try to figure out how , exactly , their embattled faction could escape electoral isolation and spearhead a blue triumph in 2020 . Third Way had spent the last two years conducting research and testing messages , and now \u2014 emerging from hours of strategy and policy sessions , polling-data slideshows , and Silicon Valley\u2013style discussion about how best to influence the party \u2019 s disruptors \u2014 they were here to make clear to the insurgent progressive left that the center now intends to stand up and fight back , and that it has Sanders in its sights just as squarely as Donald Trump .\n\u201c Right now in the Democratic Party , there is only one option on the table : Sanders-style socialism . That \u2019 s the main option on the table . We \u2019 re doing this now because the party \u2019 s got to have a choice , \u201d Jon Cowan , president of the think tank co-hosting the proceedings , with New York City real-estate executive Winston Fisher , told me . \u201c It \u2019 s going to matter a hell of a lot in 2020 , and so while 2020 may feel a ways off , in our mind it isn \u2019 t . And the ideas primary starts now . So we \u2019 re actually doing this for a very straightforward reason : to stand up and launch a serious , compelling economic alternative to Sanderism . \u201d\nA serious crowd had gathered two floors below us to hear about the first steps of this plan . Not only did the group include leading party pollsters and operatives , and influential local-level legislators , but also a pair of senators , a former governor , a handful of members of Congress , and at least four Democrats whose names have surfaced at some point in the national party \u2019 s great search for a champion to topple Trump in two years \u2019 time . Yet over two days of hotel-coffee-powered chatter , the crowd also faced up to the reality that they \u2019 re still working on what , exactly , that fight is going to look like . And whether they can find any single person to lead it into the next presidential election .\nA year and a half of exile was enough , Third Way \u2019 s leaders recently decided . So now the time was right to show some spine , which they hoped would trickle down to the lawmakers jockeying to lead the party .\n\u201c I know that a lot of the Berniecrats would like for this debate to be over , but , wow , that \u2019 s calling the debate over prematurely . The debate has barely even begun , \u201d said Cowan , ticking off his evidence for the Sanders-wing Democrats \u2019 weak claim to power : the senator lost the primary against Clinton , his post-campaign political organization has struggled to win marquee races , and a problematic single-payer health-care proposal reminiscent of Sanders \u2019 s Medicare for All rallying cry fell flat at the ballot box in Colorado in 2016 . Addressing the audience that morning , Cowan introduced a new branding and policy direction that he hoped would drive the middle back to power . He called for the rise of the \u201c Opportunity Democrats , \u201d a line of messaging built out of extensive research that was then presented by Lanae Erickson Hatalsky , a Third Way vice-president whose online bio begins with her proud vote for Ross Perot in a fifth-grade mock election .\nThe new economic platform leans heavily on words like \u201c earn \u201d and \u201c opportunity , \u201d and away from demonizing tycoons \u2014 \u201c For most Americans , billionaires and millionaires are not next door , or part of their lived experience , \u201d Cowan said in his opening speech . The policy backbone of the pitch includes an American Investment Bank designed to back \u201c Main Street , not Wall Street \u201d entrepreneurs , a \u201c Boomer Corps \u201d part-time national-service program for senior citizens whose earnings would be tax-free ( on top of their Social Security ) , a massive state-driven apprenticeship system , and universal private retirement savings accounts funded by employers .\nPulling up data from a large nationwide poll the group commissioned , combined with focus groups , Erickson Hatalsky explained that Americans , including Democrats and independents , were anxious about the future . But , she said , they were worried about the inequality of opportunity rather than the inequality of income by a healthy margin , and it was , in fact , upper-income citizens who reported worrying more about income than opportunity .\nOver and over , she revealed how the group had tested its new , future-focused \u201c Opportunity Democrat \u201d line against what she called the \u201c Sanders-style \u201d version and the \u201c Trump approach \u201d alike , and how their approach repeatedly came out on top . The conference , it was by now clear , was not only a declaration of war against Sanders , but an implicit acknowledgement that Bill Clinton\u2013era triangulation and its attendant nostalgia were politically stale , too . \u201c The time has come to mend , but not end , capitalism for a new era , \u201d Cowan told the audience , in a speech where he also declared , \u201c Big isn \u2019 t enough . If it \u2019 s bold and old , it \u2019 s simply old . \u201d\n\u201c Let \u2019 s be clear . Eighties-style supply-side , \u2019 90s centrism , and \u2019 60s socialism will not cut it for the era we live in , \u201d he conceded .\nBefore Delaware senator Chris Coons spoke on Friday morning , the sound system appeared to be sending a message . \u201c Don \u2019 t Stop Believing , \u201d it insisted .\nFights for the party \u2019 s future are nothing new for Third Way , which was founded in the post\u2013John Kerry , pre-Obama era . The centrists \u2019 theory of the 2020 case is that once that election fully breaks out after November , it will begin with a pair of pre-primaries : one to get to Sanders \u2019 s left , and one to become the face of \u201c Opportunity. \u201d The lessons of 2016 loom large .\nThe centrist crew is convinced that its message is a winning one in both a Democratic primary electorate and nationwide \u2014 \u201c An opportunity narrative resonates broadly and deeply with the very voters Democrats need to win in 2018 and 2020 , \u201d said Erickson Hatalsky \u2014 and that by seeding it in the minds of so many party activists now , they can get a handful of serious 2020 contenders onto their half of the primary bracket early . Strategists at the session said this task would likely prove easier after the midterms , especially when ( if ) Democrats win a House majority that will likely be built by rookie moderates from purple suburban areas and some red enclaves , rather than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2013style progressives from already deep-blue districts .\nYet at the core of their pitch is a fundamental belief that one of the party \u2019 s central debates is whether to tack toward swing voters , or to run a base-first national election . There was little room for doubt here that Clinton did too much of the latter , and that Sanders \u2019 s approach represents a full embrace of that side . ( And it was always Sanders who came up when the centrists spoke of the left , never Elizabeth Warren or any other potential lefty standard-bearer . )\nBut to many of the party \u2019 s leaders , including much of the 2020 crowd , the base-voters versus swing-targets discussion itself is antiquated . So who , exactly , will make Third Way \u2019 s pitch when the primaries become real ?\n\u201c Everybody \u2019 s got a camera on their phone . That never worked , but it really doesn \u2019 t now : You can \u2019 t just go and say one thing to one group and another to another group , \u201d said Jason Kander , the former Missouri secretary of state who last month opted to run for Kansas City mayor rather than president , making the case onstage that you lose both the base and swing voters if you try to differentiate between them .\nAnother featured speaker plucked from the potential 2020 list , Ohio congressman Tim Ryan , addressed the conference just a day after being unveiled as an inaugural member of the House \u2019 s new Medicare for All Caucus .
