It meant she had to weave her way through the crowd of 200 people \u2013 her biggest audience yet in the state .\nIt gave Gabbard an opportunity to see the eclectic mix of supporters her curious 2020 presidential campaign has managed to assemble : a mostly male grab-bag of veterans , anti-war activists , ex-Bernie Sanders supporters , ex-Jill Stein votersand at least one Donald Trump fan .\n\u2018 A little out of touch \u2019 : the quest to find Joe Biden 's millennial supporters Read more\nThere was a bearded man wearing a multicolored wool hat , who was carrying a big stick that he kept banging on the floor . An ex-navy seaman was there , bantering with Gabbard about her service in the army .\nA longtime Sanders-supporting carpenter pushed his way to the front as Gabbard passed , and declared that on shaking the candidate \u2019 s hand he had sensed \u201c a real force of being \u201d . At the back of the crowd an old man waved a sign that said : \u201c Free Julian Assange . Stop the torture . \u201d\nIt was an interesting time to attend a Gabbard event . The 39-year-old congresswoman , currently in her third term in the House , is coming off the back of a mild political storm after she was linked with being a Russian plant in the Democratic race , and many of her supporters were convinced of a Democratic-party-cum-mainstream-media conspiracy to depress her chances .\n\u201c Aloha ! \u201d Gabbard began \u2013 she is from Hawaii , something she mentions a lot \u2013 while her staff handed out campaign leaflets which had a picture of Gabbard and the words \u201c A soldier \u2019 s heart \u201d . ( Gabbard is a major in the national guard and has served tours of Kuwait and Iraq . She mentions that a lot , too . )\nWearing her customary white blazer and standing on a wooden bench , Gabbard spoke slowly and deliberately . Gabbard believes that the US has spent too much money meddling in other country \u2019 s affairs , and is a fervent anti-interventionist . Her belief in scaling back the military shapes her politics and is the basis of her campaign pitch .\n\u201c I like the fact that she is active in the military , but also not a warmonger , \u201d said Emily Cummings , who lives in Vermont , across the New Hampshire border .\nCummings , 31 , is a big Sanders supporter , but if Gabbard is still in the race by the time the primary comes round \u2013 Vermont votes in March , three weeks after New Hampshire \u2019 s 11 February primary vote for the Democratic party \u2019 s White House nominee , she might plump for the congresswoman .\n\u201c The fact that she wants to reallocate money from the military back to our country , which is really , really important to me \u2013 we spend a ridiculous amount of money on weapons \u2013 that is one of the biggest reasons I support her , is taking money away from that machine , \u201d Cummings said .\nGabbard says that the money saved by changing the US military \u2019 s role could be used to fund better healthcare ( Gabbard believes in universal healthcare , but stops short of banning private healthcare , like some of her rivals ) , and tackling the climate crisis ( Gabbard was an early supporter of the Green New Deal championed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives , but has since backed away from it ) .\nThat appealed to Kevin Dunwoody \u2013 the man who had felt a distinct surge of energy when he clasped Gabbard \u2019 s hand .\n\u201c We need a change in a big way . But I don \u2019 t know whether she can get the stars aligned enough to make it happen , \u201d Dunwoody said . He supported Sanders in the Democratic primary , but voted for the Green party candidate , Jill Stein , in 2016 .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t bring myself to vote for Hillary [ Clinton ] , \u201d Dunwoody said . This time he will vote for Gabbard .\n\u201c She \u2019 s one of the few that makes sense . But there \u2019 s no media coverage . She got some press coverage when Hillary said she was a spy , but the game is so fixed . \u201d\nIt was a common complaint on Saturday that the media has not given enough attention to Gabbard \u2019 s campaign . But given her current position in the race \u2013 she \u2019 s polling ninth nationally , with 1 % support \u2013 a share of the vote that has barely moved in six months \u2013 it is difficult to argue she deserves to be treated like a frontrunner .\nIn any case , Gabbard has experienced a surge in press coverage recently . As Dunwoody said , the boost came from a strange source : a number of media organizations reported that Clinton had accused Gabbard of being groomed by Russia ahead of 2020 .\nClinton did not actually say that \u2013 in an interview on the Campaign HQ podcast Clinton said Gabbard was being groomed by Republicans for a potential third-party run \u2013 and Gabbard \u2019 s campaign presumably knows this , but she has continued to fundraise on the back of the nonexistent accusation .\nGabbard has repeatedly denied she will run as an independent , but rumors persist . What is clear , however , is that of the Democratic candidates , Gabbard certainly has an unusual coalition . FiveThirtyEight found that her base is \u201c overwhelmingly male \u201d , mostly white and unusually conservative .

Gill didn \u2019 t vote for Trump in 2016 , but is considering doing so in 2020 .\n\u201c He \u2019 s done some good stuff and he \u2019 s getting slammed in the media for the most part . And Tulsi \u2019 s getting slammed in the media also . \u201d\nGill listed prison reform , \u201c calming relations with Korea \u201d and pulling out of Syria as some of Trump \u2019 s achievements .\n\u201c Actually he \u2019 s very much like Tulsi , \u201d Gill said of Trump . \u201c Stop the wars , stop wasting lives , stop wasting money . It \u2019 s the root of many of the problems . \u201d\nThere is no suggestion Gabbard \u2019 s campaign is working with Russia .
