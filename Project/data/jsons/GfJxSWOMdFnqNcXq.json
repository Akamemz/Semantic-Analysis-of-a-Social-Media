Rick Snyder , a Republican , signed the bills covering private- and public-sector workers just hours after the state Legislature acted . The right-to-work measure forbids unions from requiring workers at organized worksites to join or pay dues . Both sides say the change undercuts a key source of labor power and bargaining leverage .\n\u201c This is a major day in Michigan \u2019 s history , \u201d Mr. Snyder said . \u201c I don \u2019 t view this as anti-union at all . I view this as pro-worker . \u201d\nHouse Bill 4003 passed by a 58-51 margin , while Senate Bill 116 , which applies to private-sector unions , was approved 58-52 , making Michigan the second Midwestern state to embrace the right-to-work option .\nIndiana approved a similar law in February . The Michigan law exempts unions for police and firefighters .\n\u201c This is about freedom , fairness and equality , \u201d House Speaker Jase Bolger , a Republican , said Tuesday morning as Democrats in the chamber sought to quash or stall a vote with a slate of amendments . \u201c These are basic American rights \u2014 rights that should unite us . \u201d\nFor a state business community still struggling to gain altitude after a brutal recession , right-to-work will be a \u201c game-changer , \u201d Mr. Bolger said .\nMinority Democrats , angry that the bill was pushed through the Legislature in a lame-duck session , warned about a political backlash against Mr. Snyder and other Republicans .\n\u201c This is the nuclear option , \u201d Rep. Doug Geiss , a Democrat , told lawmakers . \u201c This is the most divisive issue that we have had to deal with . And this will have repercussions . \u201d\nTeamsters union President James P. Hoffa , who joined a crowd of more than 10,000 who descended on the state Capitol , said right-to-work proponents \u201c are waking a sleeping giant . \u2026 I think this is going to really build up the union movement in the long run . \u201d\nMirroring the fury of union activists , State Rep. Douglas Geiss , a Democrat , was more blunt : \u201c There will be blood . \u201d\nAs legislators debated , a huge throng of union members , not only from Michigan but also Ohio , Indiana , Illinois and Wisconsin , swamped the Statehouse grounds and the streets of downtown Lansing , where police in riot gear kept close watch . Bundled against the cold , many protesters banged wooden clubs on plastic buckets as impassioned speakers invoked the civil rights movement .\n\u201c No justice , no peace , \u201d they chanted as lawmakers inside the state Senate and House prepared for the final debate .\nThe Detroit News reported that one trooper used pepper spray to subdue one of the protesters . Two protesters were arrested by midday after they tried to push past troopers to get inside the George Romney Building across from the Capitol , where the governor has an office , state police Capt . Harold Love said .\nA tent put up by Americans for Prosperity-Michigan , a business-backed group that supports the right-to-work law , was torn down .\nDespite the clash , AFP-M Director Scott Hagerstrom praised the work of Republican lawmakers .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a great day for Michigan , \u201d he said amid a cacophony of bullhorns and shouting from opponents . \u201c It \u2019 s really going to move Michigan forward . We \u2019 re seeing it already in the jobs that have been created in Indiana . It does not bust the unions , but it will require unions to be more responsive to union membership . A little bit of competition is good for everyone . \u201d\nFree-market economists also praised the vote late Tuesday , saying it would make unions more accountable and improve the state \u2019 s business and investment climate .\n\u201c This is a great victory for American workers , \u201d said Richard Vedder , an economic policy adviser at the Heartland Institute in Chicago and a professor at Ohio University . \u201c Now 45 percent of Americans are covered by these laws , and it is only a matter of time before the other big Midwestern states follow suit or have their lunches eaten by Indiana and Michigan . \u201d\nWorkers , however , saw it as an injustice .
