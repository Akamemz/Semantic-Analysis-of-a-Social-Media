    "content": "The White House said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201c losing \u201d the war in Ukraine and that the European Union was set to target Moscow \u2019 s economy with new sanctions , while Ukrainian troops advanced toward the site of the downed Malaysia Airlines jet in heavy fighting with pro-Russia rebels .\n\u201c On the battlefield itself , the Ukrainians are doing very well against the separatists in trying to regain the sovereignty of their entire country , \u201d said Tony Blinken , White House deputy national security adviser . \u201c Russia \u2019 s proxies are right now on the losing end of the fight . \u201d\nMr. Blinken said the war in Ukraine has been \u201c a strategic loser for Russia \u201d that has sent the Russian economy into a tailspin since its forces annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine in March .\n\u201c There is talk that Russia has \u2026 \u2018 won \u2019 Crimea . But the fact of the matter [ is that ] what \u2019 s happened is it lost Ukraine , \u201d Mr. Blinken said . \u201c Ukraine is more united in a Western orientation than ever before . \u201d\nAnd in a phone call Monday , Vice President Joseph R. Biden told Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk that the U.S. will provide a total of $ 7 million for reconstruction in newly liberated areas of eastern Ukraine , including $ 1 million in new aid . The money will pay for clean drinking water and other small reconstruction projects .\nThe White House \u2019 s rhetoric was typical of past taunts designed to get under Mr. Putin \u2019 s skin , such as President Obama \u2019 s comment in 2013 that the Russian leader resembled a \u201c bored kid in the back of the classroom. \u201d Mr. Blinken acknowledged that the gradually increasing sanctions imposed by the West have not altered Mr. Putin \u2019 s course to date in eastern Ukraine .\nInstead , Moscow has built up its troops along the Ukrainian border , fired missiles at Ukrainian military units and supplied the rebels with heavy weapons .\nFor those reasons , administration officials said , the European Union will impose broader economic sanctions on Russia as early as Tuesday . President Obama held a video conference call Monday with the leaders of the United Kingdom , Germany , France and Italy on the subject .\nEuropean Union member states were expected to try to reach a final deal on Tuesday on stronger measures that would include closing the bloc \u2019 s capital markets to Russian state banks , an embargo on future arms sales and restrictions on energy technology and technology that could be used for defense .\nGermany , which had been reluctant to agree to tougher sanctions because of its trade links with Russia , said the downing of the airliner meant such measures were now necessary .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t ignore it . But to fall into hysterics and respond to a blow with a blow is not worthy of a major country , \u201d said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .\nFrench President Francois Hollande said in a statement that the leaders confirmed their intention to adopt new sanctions .\nThe office of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said the EU \u201c should agree [ on ] a strong package of sectoral sanctions as swiftly as possible . \u201d\n\u201c They agreed that the EU and United States should continue to work together to exert pressure on Russia to change course and to engage in a political resolution to the crisis before more innocent lives are lost , \u201d Mr. Cameron \u2019 s office said .\nIn London , an international court on Monday added to the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia , ruling that Moscow must pay $ 50 billion for using tax claims to destroy Yukos , once the country \u2019 s largest oil producer , and its Kremlin-critical CEO .\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration , a body that rules on corporate disputes , said the Russian government owes the money \u2014 a huge sum , even for such an oil-rich nation \u2014 to the former majority shareholders in Yukos Oil Co. Moscow vowed to fight the decision .\nMeanwhile , troops recaptured two rebel-held towns near the crash site and were trying to take the village of Snezhnoye , near where Kiev and Washington say rebels fired the surface-to-air missile that shot down the airliner , resulting in the loss of all 298 on board , Ukrainian officials said . But international investigators still haven \u2019 t reached the site due to the fighting .\nOne pro-government militia said 23 of its men had been killed in fighting in the past 24 hours , while a rebel commander said he had lost 30 soldiers .\nAnalysis of black box flight recorders from the airliner showed it was destroyed by shrapnel from a missile blast which caused a \u201c massive explosive decompression , \u201d a Ukrainian official said on Monday .\nIn a report on three months of fighting between government forces and separatist rebels who have set up pro-Russian \u201c republics \u201d in the east , the United Nations said more than 1,100 people had been killed . U.N.
