The justices ruled unanimously that states may compel electors , the individuals who make up the Electoral College , to vote for the winner of the statewide presidential race by either removing or fining \u201c faithless electors. \u201d In truth , this decision should not have been necessary : There is no serious constitutional argument that states are powerless to dictate electors \u2019 votes . But the nation can breathe a sigh of relief that the court did not take the bait to make the upcoming election even more chaotic .\nMonday \u2019 s decisions in Chiafalo v. Washington and Colorado v. Baca ask a question so simple that most Americans likely think it has already been settled : Can a state tell electors that they must vote for the candidate who won their state \u2019 s popular vote ? Most states do exactly that , which makes good democratic sense . If electors could vote for whomever they wanted , then presidential elections would be merely advisory ; citizens could vote for president , sure , but electors could choose whether to heed or ignore their decisions . Following the 2016 election , a handful of electors violated these laws . Two states took action against their faithless electors : Washington fined them $ 1,000 , while Colorado removed and replaced them .\nHarvard Law professor Larry Lessig organized this futile attempt to alter the election \u2019 s outcome , and after he failed , he helped the faithless electors file suit against their states . Lessig is no fan of the Electoral College : He intended to render the system so wacky and unstable that Americans would feel obliged to abolish it via constitutional amendment .
