'' Conversations on Friday did yield some points of agreement among lawmakers , including on altering Obama 's signature health care reforms and raising revenue to prevent forced cuts in government spending .\nBut overall , there has been little indication that there is any legislation yet that all the key players -- the President , the GOP-led House and the Democratic-led Senate -- will rally behind .\nMuch of the discussion of late revolves around a proposal from House Republicans to increase the federal borrowing limit for about six weeks to avoid a potentially harmful default as soon as October 17 , when the Obama administration says the government will run out of money to pay its bills .\nRepublicans like Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois say a temporary debt ceiling hike will allow all parties to `` concentrate on the continuing resolution .
