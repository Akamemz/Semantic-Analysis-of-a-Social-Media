The Affordable Care Act is socialized healthcare like Canada\u2019s. And Canadian care is the worst.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t socialized health care. Private insurance companies still provide insurance. The ACA creates regulations that private insurers have to follow\u2014like allowing children to stay on their parent\u2019s plan and not denying coverage because of a preexisting condition.

According to Somers, her incredibly ill sister-in-law had to wait a month to see the proper doctor. And death panels, she implies, offered her 75-year-old friend only treatment for pain at the end of her life.

Premiums are skyrocketing\n\nThe news is abuzz, Somers asserts, with stories of \u201cpremiums are doubling and tripling.\u201d I can\u2019t be sure what news sites Somers is visiting, but there is little evidence to support that claim. Sure, unsubsidized premiums for individuals will be a little higher, but about 80 percent of individual enrollees won\u2019t pay the sticker price because they will receive subsidies.

Cuts to Medicare are unfair to seniors.\n\nThe ACA made $700 billion in cuts to Medicare over 10 years. These cuts weren\u2019t to benefits, but to reimbursements rates for doctors and hospitals. So far, these cuts have not had any impact on the elderly enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. In fact, the program has seen an unexpected 30 percent increase since the health care law was enacted. And as a direct result of the new law, more than 6.6 million seniors with Medicare have saved over $7 billion on prescription drugs.\n\n4. Obamacare violates privacy rights.\n\nSomers says the \u201cmost frightening\u201d aspect of the ACA is that, \u201cyour most intimate and personal information is now up for grabs.\u201d As far as I can tell, she\u2019s alluding to this report in the Weekly Standard on the source code of a Healthcare.gov page, a portion of which states that users, \u201chave no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored\u201d on the site.
