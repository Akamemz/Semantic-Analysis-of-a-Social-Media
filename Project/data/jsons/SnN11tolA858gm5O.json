Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they \u2019 re published .\nLike many cities , New York City began equipping its police officers with body-worn cameras a few years ago . The footage is often invaluable evidence for the civilian agency charged with investigating complaints about NYPD abuses .\nBut first , the agency \u2019 s investigators need to get the footage . And increasingly , the NYPD is not turning it over .\nIn May , New York City \u2019 s Civilian Complaint Review Board requested body-worn camera footage for 212 cases involving possible misconduct but received only 33 responses , according to a recent internal memo .\nThe NYPD \u2019 s responsiveness has \u201c steadily gotten worse , \u201d stated the memo , which was obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The memo warned that \u201c the situation is untenable . \u201d\nThe memo \u2019 s authors wrote that lack of access to body-worn camera footage reflects a broader issue . \u201c The struggle for BWC , \u201d or body-worn camera footage , they wrote , \u201c is the struggle for the future of civilian oversight. \u201d ( Here is the memo . )\nIf investigators get bodycam footage , CCRB data shows , they are far more likely to get to the bottom of a case . Without it , they usually can \u2019 t , and often end up closing cases without finding out what really happened .\nA spokesperson for the NYPD said the coronavirus pandemic and other \u201c unprecedented events \u201d have caused the police to deploy \u201c many officers into the field and away from administrative assignments. \u201d The NYPD noted that it has recently shared 703 videos related to complaints stemming from the police protests . ( Here is the NYPD \u2019 s full statement . )\nWhile the pandemic has exacerbated the issue , the NYPD \u2019 s responsiveness began to be problematic much earlier . In early 2019 , the percentage of alleged abuse cases waiting for NYPD footage spiked more than fourfold , to 37 % . A CCRB report noted \u201c mounting delays in the receipt of key evidence , especially BWC footage . \u201d\nThe delays in turning over footage can have a significant effect on whether police officers are held accountable when people come forward with accusations of misconduct , such as racially profiling or pistol-whipping a person . There \u2019 s an 18-month statute of limitations on bringing any discipline charges against NYPD officers , whether the charges are initiated by the CCRB or by the department itself .\nMultiple entities have responsibility for investigating abuse and corruption by NYPD officers . The NYPD has its own internal investigators , and local and federal prosecutors , of course , can also bring criminal charges .\nBut it \u2019 s the CCRB that \u2019 s supposed to provide an independent venue for complaints against police . The agency has the authority to investigate everything from officers being discourteous to police violence against civilians . It was the CCRB \u2019 s investigation of the 2014 death of Eric Garner after an officer used a chokehold that ultimately led the NYPD to fire the officer .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 recently detailed , the NYPD has nearly complete discretion over how much it cooperates with CCRB investigations . While the CCRB can recommend punishment , the police commissioner can and often does decide to do otherwise .\nThat discretion extends to footage from body-worn cameras . CCRB investigators have to submit individual requests . The NYPD has often responded to the requests by saying the footage doesn \u2019 t exist \u2014 only for the CCRB to later discover it does .\nThe CCRB and NYPD worked out an agreement last year to allow civilian investigators to be in the room while officers search for footage . Implementation of the deal has been delayed by the pandemic . When it does start , CCRB investigators still won \u2019 t have direct access to the files .\nOther cities , such as Washington , San Francisco and New Orleans , have created a much simpler process .
