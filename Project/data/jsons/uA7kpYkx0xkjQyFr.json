Ms. Nielsen had been blindsided by Mr. Trump \u2019 s sudden decision to drop the nomination of Ron Vitiello , a veteran border official , from consideration to head U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , this person said . That , at a time when the agency is wrestling with record numbers of families crossing illegally in search of asylum , prompted Ms. Nielsen to resign , the person said .\nMr. Trump made public Ms. Nielsen \u2019 s exit via Twitter on Sunday , thanking her for her service . He named U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as acting homeland security secretary . Mr. Trump \u2019 s defense secretary and interior secretary are also serving in an acting capacity .\nIn a letter to the president , Ms. Nielsen wrote that \u201c despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age , I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside . \u201d\nThe 47-year-old Ms. Nielsen had repeated run-ins with the White House during her tenure , and Mr. Trump \u2019 s recent threats to close the southern border had spurred warnings from her department that such a move could have a serious economic impact on the U.S. , according to several government officials .\nMr. Trump has since acknowledged he is unlikely to completely shut the border , but he continues to threaten Mexico with car tariffs and other punitive actions if it doesn \u2019 t do more to stem the flow of illegal migrants across its country and into the U.S .\nOn Sunday , following Ms. Nielsen \u2019 s resignation , Mr. Trump said that he \u201c Will Close Southern Border If necessary ...... Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States , or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs , \u201d he said . \u201c Our Country is FULL ! \u201d\nThe decision to revoke plans to nominate Mr. Vitiello , without Ms. Nielsen \u2019 s knowledge , underscored growing efforts at the White House to seize tighter control over the administration \u2019 s immigration policies . \u201c Ron \u2019 s a good man.\u2026But we \u2019 re going in a tougher direction , \u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday .\nThe president in February declared a national emergency along the border in order to redirect money from elsewhere in the government to help pay for portions of a proposed border wall . A battle over funding that wall was at the heart of the country \u2019 s longest-ever government shutdown .\nDuring a visit last week to the border , in Calexico , Calif. , Mr. Trump praised Mr. McAleenan , who had accompanied the president to California on Air Force One , saying he had been \u201c doing a great job \u201d as commissioner of CBP . Ms. Nielsen also joined the president on the trip to the border .\nMr. McAleenan would inherit a sprawling department , with a portfolio that spans domestic emergencies , terrorism , legal immigration and cybersecurity , as well as the border scenario he has been confronting at CBP , which he recently said had brought the southern border infrastructure to \u201c the breaking point . \u201d\nMr. McAleenan has been at the forefront of the Trump administration \u2019 s efforts to respond to the thousands of Central American migrants seeking asylum at the border each day .\nAs commissioner of CBP , he oversaw the agency that includes the U.S. Border Patrol , which is intercepting the migrants as they turn themselves in between ports of entry , but finding its resources rapidly taxed for the needs of children and families , in particular .\nHe has walked a careful line in supporting the president \u2019 s call for an extended physical barrier at the border , including publicly describing the value of some of the options on the table to his agency .\nBut Mr. McAleenan has also diverged from the president \u2019 s rhetoric in several areas , most notably by describing the importance of U.S. aid to Central America in helping to bring economic and political stability to the countries from which the migrants are fleeing poverty and violence .\nThe overall number of apprehensions at the border has fallen in recent years , in part as the number of single Mexican men seeking work in the U.S. has declined . At the same time , the presence of children and families seeking asylum has increased dramatically , placing new and different demands on the government that Mr. McAleenan has warned starkly it can not meet without legal changes . He has called for many of the same legal changes as Ms. Nielsen , including to laws that make it harder for the U.S. government to swiftly remove children from noncontiguous countries , such as Guatemala and Honduras .\nDemocrats have signaled they are unlikely to agree to the major changes to the legal framework for asylum seekers sought by the Trump administration , saying instead that the U.S. can \u2019 t be allowed to turn its backs on children fleeing violence .\nThe chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , Rep.
