By the way, the regular flu, other flus, other things, SARS or H1N1, any of them, if you look at the young people they were affected like everybody else, but for whatever reason with respect to COVID, the numbers are very, very low.\u201d \u2014 remarks Monday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Although it\u2019s true that children are less likely than adults to develop COVID-19, the CDC has nevertheless counted more than 86,000 infections by the virus in Americans younger than 18.\n\nTrump\u2019s statements overlook severe COVID-19 illnesses and some deaths of children in the U.S., even though kids in general tend to get less sick from it than adults do. He also glosses over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves.\n\nThe CDC in April studied the pandemic\u2019s effect on different ages in the U.S. and reviewed preliminary research in China, where the coronavirus started. It said social distancing is important for children, too, for their own safety and that of others.\n\n\u201cWhereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group,\u201d the CDC study says.\n\nLast month, the CDC also warned doctors to be on the lookout for a rare but life-threatening inflammatory reaction in some children who\u2019ve had the coronavirus. The condition had been reported in more than 100 children in New York, and in some kids in several other states and in Europe, with some deaths.\n\n___\n\nJUDGES\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThese horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts ... Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d \u2014 tweets Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Whether justices like or dislike a president is irrelevant to their rulings.\n\nTrump was referring to two major decisions this past week on LGBT rights and immigration in which the conservative-leaning Supreme Court handed him defeats. But they were nothing personal.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts sided with the court\u2019s liberals in both cases. Also ruling against Trump in the LGBT case was Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of Trump\u2019s two appointees.\n\nRoberts has sought to emphasize the judiciary\u2019s independence from the political branches of government and make clear that justices are not \u201cpoliticians in robes.\u201d After Trump in 2018 went after a judge who ruled against his migrant asylum order, calling him an \u201cObama judge,\u201d Roberts issued an extraordinary rebuke.\n\n\u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\u201d Roberts said in response to an inquiry from The Associated Press. \u201cWhat we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCausey reported from Dallas.
