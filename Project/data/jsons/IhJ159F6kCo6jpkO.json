But the uptick shows big business eyeing the chances that Democrats could win in November and trying to make early inroads with potential party leaders . The contributions could help Democrats on their way to control of the House \u2014 but also could exacerbate tension within the party \u2019 s ranks over its relationship with corporate PACs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s definitely been an uptick , \u201d said Arshi Siddiqui , a former aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi who \u2019 s now a lobbyist at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld . She said Democratic lobbyists who work in-house in corporate offices in Washington are making the case that companies \u2019 PACs should give more to Democrats right now .\nRepublican committee chairmen still raise much more from corporate PACs than their Democratic counterparts , hauling in $ 4.6 million in the first half of this year \u2014 about 40 percent more than Democratic ranking members raised .\nBut corporate PACs \u2014 which are funded by employees \u2019 and shareholders \u2019 giving , not by the corporations themselves \u2014 are giving more to Democratic ranking members than they did in 2016 , when the party \u2019 s chances of retaking the House were considered markedly lower .\nThe 18 Democratic ranking members who are running for reelection raised 16 percent more from corporate PACs for their campaigns and leadership PACs in the first half of this year than they did in the first half of 2016 , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s analysis . Republican committee chairmen who are running for reelection \u2014 eight of the 20 are retiring \u2014 raised 12 percent less compared to the same period in 2016 .\nCongressional Democrats hold roughly an 8-point lead on the generic ballot , according to the FiveThirtyEight polling average . The party may reap even more corporate donations if polls continue to show them leading during the campaign \u2019 s home stretch .\n\u201c If you look at history , when a change in control is likely , a lot of corporate PACs will wait until Oct. 1 and make contributions \u201d to the party expected to seize the majority , said Charlie Black , a veteran Republican lobbyist .\nSome House Democrats have seen corporate PAC contributions rise even more than McGovern this year .\nRep. Jerry Nadler ( D-N.Y. ) , who \u2019 s set to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee if Democrats win back the chamber , raised about $ 162,000 from corporate PACs in the first six months of this year \u2014 more than double the amount he raised in the first half of 2016 . Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D-Ore. ) , the ranking member on the House Transportation Committee , has raised 57 percent more from corporate PACs ; Rep. Richard Neal ( D-Mass . ) , who \u2019 s set to chair the powerful House Ways and Means Committee , has raised 43 percent more .\nNadler and Neal only became the ranking members of their committees last year , and McGovern only became the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee after Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D-N.Y. ) died in March , which may account for part of the spikes in their fundraising .\nBut other Democrats who held the top spots on their committees last cycle \u2014 including Rep.

Frank Pallone , the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee ; and DeFazio \u2014 have seen their fundraising climb over the past six months , too .\nThe shift in any single corporate PAC \u2019 s giving is often subtle , partly because most corporate PACs strive to give to Democrats and Republicans .\nToyota \u2019 s PAC , for instance , has cut checks to 10 Republican committee chairmen and seven Democratic ranking members this cycle , according to campaign finance disclosures .
