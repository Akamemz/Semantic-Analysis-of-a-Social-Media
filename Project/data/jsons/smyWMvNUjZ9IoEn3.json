The essence of Pat Cipollone\u2019s letter argued that the impeachment investigation is illegitimate, unconstitutional and unfair.\n\nThe illegitimacy argument contended that since the House has yet to vote to authorize an investigation of the president, its committees lack subpoena power. The unconstitutional argument offered that since impeachment seeks to overturn a valid election, it is a thinly veiled coup and thus is in violation of the Constitution.

But as legal offerings, they are profoundly misguided. Here is the backstory.\n\nThe Constitution gives the \u201csole power of impeachment\u201d to the House of Representatives.

It permits clients to silence their lawyers about communications between them. Its sister privilege \u2014 the work product doctrine \u2014 also comes from a court rule, and it permits clients to keep secret certain documents prepared in furtherance of those legal communications.\n\nBut all legislation is subject to the Constitution and is subordinate to it. Thus, given the House\u2019s \u201csole power,\u201d any legislation interfering with the exercise of that power would become moot.

The president may not care for the House rules, but there is no appeal from them. The particular rule in question \u2014 the committee power to issue subpoenas without a full House vote \u2014 came about when Republicans controlled the House.\n\nImpeachment is always constitutional if it originates in the House and if its basis is arguably for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
