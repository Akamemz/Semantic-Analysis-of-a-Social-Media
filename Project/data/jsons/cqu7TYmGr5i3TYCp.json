    "content": "Eli Stokols is a national politics reporter . Shane Goldmacher is a political reporter covering the 2016 presidential race .\nThree days before Florida \u2019 s climactic primary , Marco Rubio sank deep into a black leather armchair on his campaign bus . He had just spent 25 minutes smiling wide for supporters at a high-end boutique selling $ 150 candles . \u201c Don \u2019 t forget to vote on Tuesday ! \u201d he shouted from the third step of a wood-paneled staircase . Now , on his parked bus , the afternoon sunlight shut out by drawn blinds , the smile was gone . The candidate knew it was already over .\n\u201c There will be a reckoning in the mainstream media , where all these networks and cable networks are going to have to ask themselves why did they give so much coverage for the sake of ratings , \u201d he said . \u201c There will be a reckoning in the conservative movement , where a lot of people who for a long time have espoused conservative principles seem to not care about those anymore in rallying around Donald Trump because they like his attitude .\n\u201c I think there are a lot of people in the conservative movement who are going to spend years and years explaining to people how they fell into this and how they allowed this to happen . \u201d\nFor now , though , it is Rubio \u2019 s reckoning that \u2019 s at hand . And not just because of Trump or cable television networks .\nRubio \u2019 s strategy was always an inside straight\u2014overly reliant on a candidate \u2019 s ability to dominate free national media in order to outperform , outwit and eventually outlast a wide field of rivals . It was sketched out by an inner circle of advisers who believed they could eschew the very fundamentals of presidential campaigning because they had a candidate who transcended .\nThat 's exactly what happened in 2016 ; it just turned out Rubio wasn \u2019 t the one transcending .\nEven before his picturesque launch at symbolic Freedom Tower in Miami last spring , Rubio \u2019 s aides were hardly the only ones who saw in Rubio an answer to the Republican Party \u2019 s prayers : a young , charismatic and Hispanic conservative , the son of a bartender and a maid with remarkably broad appeal across a GOP spectrum riven by ideological and stylistic divisions . He \u2019 d been plastered on the cover of Time as \u201c The Republican Savior. \u201d Rubio was the kind of rare talent who could win a primary and then articulate a conservative message that resonated in a fast-changing country in the general .\nThey didn \u2019 t need a particular political base . They didn \u2019 t need to talk process . They didn \u2019 t need a ground game . All they needed was Marco .\nSo while other campaigns touted \u201c shock and awe \u201d fundraising networks and precise , psychographic analytics and voter targeting operations , Rubio \u2019 s tight-knit group of mostly 40-something bros believed wholeheartedly that they didn \u2019 t need a specific early-state win . They did n't need a particular political base . They didn \u2019 t need to talk process . They did n't need a ground game . They didn \u2019 t need to be the immediate front-runner .\nTheir confidence bordered on arrogance . Sure , his closest advisers\u2014campaign manager Terry Sullivan and media strategists Todd Harris and Heath Thompson\u2014were right that their candidate was likable . He began the race as the second choice of many Republican primary voters . They just never figured out how to make voters embrace him as their first .\nTrump was drawing away the cameras they had banked on lifting their rising star , sucking up all the media attention as he dominated media cycle after media cycle , setting the parameters of the 2016 debate , day after day . Suddenly , their telegenic candidate couldn \u2019 t get on TV .\nAnd when Rubio stumbled , as all candidates do , there was no infrastructure to catch him , no field program to lift his support , no base to fall back upon .\nAs Jeb Bush was quickly beset by leaks , backbiting and inflated expectations , Rubio \u2019 s campaign more closely resembled the Barack Obama model of 2008 from the start . It was a close-knit group , led by Sullivan , Thompson and Harris , with Alex Conant , Rubio \u2019 s communications director since 2011 , Rich Beeson , the deputy campaign manager , pollster Whit Ayers and a few others in the innermost circle .\nThey held conference calls three times a week to stay on the same page , and based their headquarters only a few blocks from Capitol Hill to better coordinate with Rubio when the Senate was in session . Sullivan ran a tight ship . In the early months of the campaign , he insisted on personally signing off on every expense above $ 500 . The limit was later relaxed but symbolic of a campaign that knew it had to scrimp to compete with Bush , whose super PAC hauled in $ 100 million in the first half of 2015 .\nThe campaign spared no expense in setting up events to be television-friendly . There were invariably press risers , tidy backdrops and television lighting to portray Rubio , quite literally , in the best imaginable light .\nBut one of the things Sullivan seemed least interested in was field offices . The campaign would force volunteers and supporters to pay for their own yard signs , posters and bumper stickers .\nRubio arrives to address supporters at a caucus night party on February 1 , 2016 in Des Moines , Iowa . | Getty\nRubio seemed to agree . In August , he was due to open his Iowa state headquarters the morning after flipping pork chops at the state fair , but he bailed at the last minute . The reason : heading back to Florida for his children \u2019 s start of school . The grand opening would be delayed for 10 days , and it would occur without Rubio . He wouldn \u2019 t announce a state director to run operations in the crucial caucuses for another month .\nIt was a fitting episode for a campaign that had bragged about how staff could work just as well out of a Starbucks with a laptop . The campaign wouldn \u2019 t announce supporters in Iowa \u2019 s various regions until January 2016 , and only then under intensifying pressure from allies . And when campaign officials announced their \u201c field offices , \u201d they wouldn \u2019 t say exactly where they actually were , making it all but impossible for volunteers to volunteer .\nIt \u2019 s not that Rubio \u2019 s team didn \u2019 t know the data science that powered Obama \u2019 s two campaigns or that studies showed that door knocks and personal phone calls are among the most effective means to get out the vote . It \u2019 s that they \u2019 re expensive and time-consuming . And Rubio \u2019 s team thought they had figured out a better way : targeting exactly their voters with pinpoint precision online , on TV and in the mail .\n\u201c It \u2019 s almost like they wanted to prove they could win without doing some of the stuff people have to do to win , \u201d said one Rubio supporter very familiar with the campaign \u2019 s planning . \u201c Were they just fucking lazy or arrogant ? \u201d\nIn fact , they had designed a campaign to fit neatly with Rubio \u2019 s own conception of himself as master political communicator .\n\u201c Marco is convinced , and perhaps rightly so , that he has the skills to convince anyone , \u201d said Dan Gelber , who served for eight years in the Florida Legislature with Rubio , including two as the Democratic counterpart when Rubio was GOP speaker . \u201c He really believes that if you give him an audience , he can turn them to his way of thinking . \u201d\nDonors were unnerved by it , though . So Terry Sullivan outlined the plans to some of Rubio \u2019 s supporters at a closed-door strategy session at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas in October .\nThe campaign \u2019 s goal , Sullivan explained , was simply to put Rubio \u201c in front of as many voters as possible as often as possible , \u201d according to an attendee . And that meant getting free media coverage and buying paid television ads . So the campaign had locked in ad rates early\u2014paying as little as 10 cents for every dollar spent by Bush \u2019 s super PAC . At times , they \u2019 d spend far less than Bush \u2019 s allies and still out-advertise them .\nThe team wanted Marco to sell himself on TV , not rely on second-rate surrogates or volunteers . And that meant less focus on door-knocking or volunteer phone-calling .\nIt \u2019 s almost like they wanted to prove they could win without doing some of the stuff people have to do to win . \u201d\nDonors and early-state supporters who had grown accustomed to presidential-level coddling and attention pushed back . And by December , Optimus , the firm paid nearly $ 900,000 to run Rubio \u2019 s analytics operation , prepared a public memo to quiet the critics . The memo described a hypothetical Midwestern state with 150,000 likely voters ( roughly the expected Iowa turnout at the time ) and one candidate at 20 percent , trailing another at 30 percent .\nIt was clear to everyone it was about Rubio and Iowa .\nIn it , Optimus made the case that running a ground game \u201c missed the elephant in the room \u201d as it nudged support up less than 1 percentage point . \u201c You \u2019 ve got a 10 point gap you need to close , \u201d the memo read .\n\u201c All this is not to say that door knocking doesn \u2019 t work . We know it does , \u201d the memo concluded .\nSullivan put it most succinctly to the New York Times in December : \u201c More people in Iowa see Marco on \u2018 Fox and Friends \u2019 than see Marco when he is in Iowa . \u201d\nThe ground-free strategy surprised Democrats and even some of Rubio \u2019 s rivals .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t even a question in the mind of anyone who \u2019 s worked on presidential campaigns , \u201d Dan Pfieffer , a former senior adviser to President Obama , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this year . \u201c You have to build an extensive and aggressive ground operation to win . \u201d\n\u201c The weirdest thing is that we \u2019 re debating this , \u201d Pfieffer added .\nTed Cruz had invested more in ground operations than any other Republican , and his campaign manager , Jeff Roe , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he was surprised how few ground troops any of his opponents were mobilizing .\n`` It \u2019 s a huge investment ; it \u2019 s a huge investment of resources when a lot of people might not know how many resources they have , so I understand why they don \u2019 t do it , \u201d Roe said . But there \u2019 s an advantage : `` The ground game just never goes away . ''",
