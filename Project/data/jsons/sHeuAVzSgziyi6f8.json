    "content": "Hillary Clinton , The 'Gender Card ' And What It Could Mean In November\nIt 's essentially impossible to win the Democratic nomination without support from women .\nIn primaries and caucuses across the country , women make up a solid majority of the Democratic electorate . In fact , according to exit poll data , there 's not a state that 's voted to date where women made up less than 54 percent of Democratic voters . And , in Mississippi , women made up nearly two-thirds ( 64 percent ) of Democratic primary voters .\nWomen , of course , like any demographic , are not a monolith . Hillary Clinton consistently loses young women ( ages 18 to 29 ) to Bernie Sanders . But , accounting for women of all different groups , Clinton has a clear advantage .\nThere are n't exit polls for every single state , but the common thread from all the data from the exit polls conducted to date show women , as a bloc , are supporting Clinton over Sanders . ( Young women do n't vote as regularly . And Clinton performs best with older women , who are far more loyal voters . )\nThere are a few exceptions : New Hampshire \u2014 where Sanders dominated essentially every demographic ; Vermont \u2014 Sanders ' home turf , where he won women by more than 60 points ; and Wisconsin \u2014 where Sanders and Clinton essentially broke even with women .\nThere could be more exceptions as the primary season continues , but , for now , exit-poll analyses suggest Clinton has a safety net , and it 's essentially a web of women .\nNPR interviewed dozens of women in different states about Clinton .
