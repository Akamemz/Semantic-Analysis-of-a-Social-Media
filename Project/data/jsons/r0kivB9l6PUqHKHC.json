    "content": "Welcome to November . Earlier in the week , one of the oldest and most respected polling firms in America -- Gallup -- produced results based on thousands of voter contacts indicating that Mitt Romney is leading in national early voting by roughly six percentage points . Last night , another venerable polling outfit confirmed Gallup 's findings with a survey of its own . From Pew Research :\nThe Pew Research Center survey found that the race is even among all likely voters nationwide ( 47 % Obama , 47 % Romney ) . Unlike the last campaign , the race also is close among voters who say they have already voted . In the poll , conducted Oct. 24-28 , 19 % of likely voters say they have already voted ; that is unchanged from the same week in the 2008 campaign ( Oct. 23-26 , 2008 ) . Currently , Romney holds a seven-point edge among early voters ( 50 % to 43 % ) ; because of the small sample , this lead is not statistically significant . At this point four years ago , Obama led John McCain by 19 points ( 53 % to 34 % ) among early voters .\nThe overall sample was roughly 1700 voters , only about half the size of Gallup 's pool , but resulting in nearly the exact same early voting outcome . In this case , Romney by seven . Gallup found that Obama led McCain by 15 points in early tallies at this stage in 2008 ; Pew puts the gap at 19 points , so their 2012 numbers represent a 26-point swing to the GOP ticket . That 's ... not insignificant . But what about in the swing states ? The Washington Post reports that Obama has the lead in most ( but not all ) of the contested battlegrounds , but that Romney is hugely outpacing McCain 's 2008 numbers . In brief , Republicans are narrowing the gap in Nevada , North Carolina and Iowa ( where one new state poll gives Romney a slight overall lead , while another shows Obama winning ) .
