At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it \u2019 s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed \u2014 such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But\u2026 \u2018 even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. \u2019 \u2026\nFinally , many point out that \u201c shutting down ports of entry would be an economic disaster . It would also disrupt the lives of border communities that rely on the flow of people between the US and Mexico \u2014 including the major cities of San Diego ( and Tijuana ) and El Paso ( and Ciudad Juarez ) . Approximately $ 1.5 billion worth of commerce happens along the US-Mexico border every day\u2026 When the San Ysidro port of entry in San Diego shut down for a few hours in November , as agents responded with force ( including tear gas ) to an organized march of asylum seekers , the temporary closure cost about $ 5.3 million in lost business revenue\u2026 Literally no one but Trump actually wants to close border crossings. \u201d Dara Lind , Vox\nTrump \u2019 s \u201c own State Department publicly states that its strategy is to provide foreign assistance to Central America and protect American citizens \u2018 by addressing the security , governance , and economic drivers of illegal immigration and illicit trafficking. \u2019 The aid -- again according to Trump 's State Department -- \u2018 goes toward fighting crime organizations , drug trafficking , gang violence and human trafficking , while strengthening borders and enhancing security \u2019 \u2026 His reactive move to punish the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador will undoubtedly increase migration , rather than deter it . \u201d Samantha Vinograd , CNN\n\u201c If word got out that paying $ 7,000 to \u2018 coyotes \u2019 for the trip to the border was likely to result in a prompt return trip , the flow would diminish \u2014 which would mean fewer children in danger . Congress should consider both requests favorably , along with more aid to Central America to get at the root causes of this exodus. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c There is a genuine problem at the U.S.-Mexico border\u2026 [ But ] cutting off aid to Central America or \u2018 closing the border , \u2019 as Mr. Trump now threatens , would make things worse\u2026 [ The commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ] would like Congress to give him authority to hold these migrants for up to eight weeks . That would allow time to process their claims , which would in many cases be denied . He also wants authority to return unaccompanied children to their home countries , which the law allows for Mexicans and Canadians but not Central Americans\u2026\n\u201c Are U.S. immigration officials even trying to come up with a better temporary fix than human beings sleeping on ice-cold gravel ? \u2026 The humanitarian crisis at the southern border is real -- but the human rights violations are the ones that the United States government is either exacerbating or flat-out creating . Indeed , the budget bill passed by Congress this winter aimed to spend money on upgrading government detention facilities and increasing the number of now-overloaded immigration judges to process the asylum claims of refugees more quickly . But Team Trump seems much more interested in cannibalizing our military to pay for his grandiose border wall. \u201d Will Bunch , Philadelphia Inquirer\n\u201c Certainly , the United States can not open its southern borders to all comers . But there is little excuse for not processing this wave of migrants in an orderly and humane manner . Turning the lives of desperate people who yearn for freedom into political talking points is unconscionable. \u201d Editorial Board , Deseret News\nThe left criticizes the administration for the inhumane treatment of asylum seekers , and argues that these latest moves will worsen the situation and hurt the US economy .\nThe right argues that there is a major crisis at the border , which is exacerbated by the changing demographics of those apprehended .\nThe right argues that there is a major crisis at the border , which is exacerbated by the changing demographics of those apprehended .\n\u201c As recently as 2012 , 90 percent of apprehensions along the southern border were single adults .
