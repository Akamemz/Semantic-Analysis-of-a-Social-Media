We have political infighting and fatal shootings whose motivations can \u2019 t seem to shake a deep-seated racial bias . We \u2019 re told this is normal , to be expected .\nBut mounting psychological research argues these stories are fraught with a dangerous selection bias , one that makes people less sympathetic to those not part of their supposed in-group . We pick sides . We draw clear lines in the sand , based on hard-formed opinions about world views and skin color , which set us apart from one another \u2014 though , not because of any explicit desire to hate , psychologists find , but the more insidious fact that it just seems correct .\nThe difficulty in staying neutral , or at least open-minded , seems to be one inherent in how our brains work , says David Pietraszewski , a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute in Germany . And the news isn \u2019 t helping to escape that compulsion .\n\u201c When people express opinions that reflect the views of different political parties , our minds automatically and spontaneously assign them to rival coalitions. \u201d We can \u2019 t help it , in other words , when we feel a visceral opposition to people that don \u2019 t share our views . Oftentimes , Pietraszewski explains , our ability to consider alternate possibilities gets swallowed up by our needs for certainty and sameness . When we watch the news , these ill-formed boundaries get reinforced .\nThat effect was shown in a recent study Pietraszewski helped carry out , which was published in the journal Cognition . He and a team of evolutionary psychologists wanted to find out how people categorize themselves on the basis of political views , race , gender , and age . While gender and age played no role , they found politics and race demarcated the groups the most , and in a mutually exclusive way . If politics divided people , race didn \u2019 t play a factor .

What Pietraszewski \u2019 s research suggests is that political views just happen to overshadow race ; when put in the spotlight , racial tensions can just as easily incite emotional responses that create clear \u201c us versus them \u201d dynamics .
