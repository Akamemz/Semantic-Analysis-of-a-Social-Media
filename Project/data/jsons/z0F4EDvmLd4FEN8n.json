    "content": "Last week , Attorney General William Barr \u2019 s investigation into the illegal FBI\u2013CIA spy operation against President Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign was formally shifted to a criminal investigation . The means the investigative team , under the direction of John Durham , U.S. Attorney for Connecticut , can subpoena witnesses , convene grand juries , and obtain indictments .\nOne of the principal perpetrators , former FBI director James Comey , insists he \u2019 s not worried at all . He and his co-conspirators have undoubtedly talked often and coordinated their stories . All voice communications , emails , text messages , and other communications have been erased or otherwise destroyed to the extent they can be .\nFrom a variety of reports we know that despite President Trump \u2019 s order that all federal agencies cooperate with the Durham investigation , the CIA is stonewalling and trying to deny Durham access to documents , electronically stored information , and probably witnesses .\nThe CIA \u2019 s conduct is not surprising . CIA Director Gina Haspel is the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Obama \u2019 s CIA director , John Brennan . Her interest is more in protecting Brennan and other current and former CIA people than in obeying the president \u2019 s order .\nAs I wrote in June , Haspel was CIA station chief in London when the \u201c Crossfire Hurricane \u201d investigation into Trump and his campaign operated from there . She had to have known and approved of the op , and she must have taken an active part in it . She \u2019 s a major problem that Trump doesn \u2019 t recognize .\nBut some of the principal perps , such as James Clapper , Obama \u2019 s director of national intelligence , are not descendants of Wernher von Braun . They will want to retract statements they \u2019 ve made to their media pals , such as the one Clapper made to CNN three weeks ago .\nOn October 7 , Clapper made it clear that he was following Obama \u2019 s orders in conducting the spy op on Trump and his campaign . Asked if he was concerned that Durham \u2019 s investigation would uncover wrongdoing by intelligence officials such as himself , Clapper offered a response that is worth quoting at length :\nThe message I \u2019 m getting from all this is , apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference , ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us , and oh , by the way , blown off what the then commander in chief , President Obama , told us to do , which was to assemble all the reporting that we could that we had available to us and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration . And while we \u2019 re at it , declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public , and that \u2019 s what we did .\nClearly , unmistakably , Clapper said that he and the other intelligence officials \u2014 meaning at least Comey and Brennan \u2014 were following Obama \u2019 s orders to spy on the Trump campaign and probably Trump himself .\nThe only possible basis for those orders was the \u201c Steele dossier , \u201d the opposition research document bought and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign . Clapper , Comey , or Brennan \u2014 or any combination of the three \u2014 used it as the basis to get orders from Obama to conduct the operation .\nIn all probability , they coordinated with Obama and kept him posted on the spy op through his national security adviser , Susan Rice , who is another probable target for Durham \u2019 s investigation . Her conversations with Obama \u2014 on which she ( and Obama ) will claim executive privilege \u2014 would prove very enlightening if he can get her testimony about them .\nThis wasn \u2019 t a matter of Obama only having knowledge and acquiescing in what they did . It was \u2014 according to Clapper \u2019 s statement \u2014 a decision Obama made to order the U.S. intelligence agencies to jointly conduct an operation spying on the Trump campaign to prove Trump was collaborating with Russia to cause his own election .\nNow Clapper is asserting the Nuremberg Defense : \u201c I was only following orders. \u201d May it do him as much good as it did those who first asserted it .\nBoth the decision to turn the Durham investigation into a criminal proceeding and Clapper \u2019 s admission that Obama gave the order to spy on Trump based on the Steele dossier will have an enormous effect on the 2020 election .\nThe election campaign is already running in the shadow of Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff \u2019 s impeachment proceedings against President Trump . The media follow it breathlessly , cramming as much news of it as they can speak or print on any given day .\nThe only other matter they pay attention to is the Democrats \u2019 primaries .\nBut now , with the acceleration of Durham \u2019 s investigation , even the most liberal media outlets will have to take time to report Durham \u2019 s coming interviews and indictments . That time will have to be taken away from coverage of the impeachment or of the Dems \u2019 primaries .\nClapper \u2019 s admission raises the question : What did Joe Biden know and when did he know it ?\nBiden continually brags about what he and Obama did and how close they were in thinking and acting . It \u2019 s possible that as vice president he wasn \u2019 t privy to the Obama \u2019 s orders to the intelligence community to spy on Trump , but he must have been aware of what they were doing .\nBiden has a choice : he can either can deny that he knew what the intelligence community was doing against Trump ( and appear the fool ) , or admit he knew and try to deny the illegality of Obama \u2019 s orders . He would thus implicate himself in the intelligence community \u2019 s crimes .\nOl \u2019 Joe is toast . And so should be the other participants in the spy op on Trump \u2019 s campaign . People such as Comey , Brennan , and Clapper may never go to jail , but many \u2014 perhaps most of them \u2014 may be indicted for the host of crimes they evidently committed .\nWe \u2019 ll ( finally ) get a small taste of what \u2019 s to come in the report by the Department of Justice \u2019 s Inspector General Michael Horowitz . His report supposedly is almost ready for publication . It covers only the abuse of the FBI \u2019 s powers in obtaining surveillance warrants for Trump campaign officials from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court .\nThanks to the investigation that Rep. Devin Nunes ( R-Calif. ) conducted while he was chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \u2014 and the famous \u201c Nunes Memo \u201d published in February 2018 \u2014 we know that the FISA warrants were obtained fraudulently . The FISA court wasn \u2019 t told that the allegations in the warrant applications were based only on the Steele dossier and unverified by the FBI . That , at least , is a false official statement under 18 US Code 1001 punishable by a year in jail .\nBut that offense is chicken feed compared to the illegality of what had to be a conspiracy to thwart Trump \u2019 s presidential ambitions and , after the election , to bring about his impeachment .\nThe perps have a lot to fear from Durham \u2019 s investigation . He was chosen by AG Barr because he has considerable experience in intelligence matters , so he will know how to extract information and possibly obtain plea bargains from people who are threatened with jail time .\nIt \u2019 s entirely possible \u2014 despite Clapper \u2019 s statement to CNN \u2014 that some will stonewall like Susan McDougal did in the Clinton impeachment . McDougal went to prison rather than testify against Clinton in the Whitewater scandal . Unlikely as it may be , people such as Clapper , Comey , and Brennan may try to protect Obama the same way .\nBut people such as former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe , former FBI agent Peter Strzok , and former FBI lawyer ( and Strzok \u2019 s lover ) Lisa Page won \u2019 t . They ( and Comey ) were directly involved in preparing and approving the surveillance warrants against Trump campaign officials . So were Obama \u2019 s acting deputy AG Sally Yates and former deputy AG Rod Rosenstein . They could plead out and testify against Brennan and his ilk .\nIs it unthinkable that Durham would prosecute Obama ? Unfortunately it is , but Durham shouldn \u2019 t hesitate to do so . Americas are fed up with crimes committed by Democrats \u2014 such as Hillary \u2019 s illegal trafficking of classified information in unsecured non-government emails \u2014 who aren \u2019 t held accountable for their crimes .\nWhomever Durham prosecutes , the Dems won \u2019 t stop their campaigns against Trump . It \u2019 s almost certain that he will be impeached by the House . Who knows what will happen in the Senate trial when Trump enemies such as Mitt Romney , Susan Collins , and Lisa Murkowski vote ?\nIf , despite the impeachment , Trump is reelected , the Dems will restart the \u201c Russia collusion \u201d campaign , claiming that his 2020 win was caused by collaboration with Russia , Iran , North Korea , China , and any other bad actors they can think of . You can take that to the bank .",
