Ted Cruz continues to position himself as the chief alternative to Trump .\n`` I understand the people who are supporting Donald Trump . You 're angry , '' he told supporters .\n`` Now if you 're fed up with the corruption of Washington , the answer is not supporting someone who has been funding and profiting off that Washington corruption for decades , '' he said .\nCruz kept Trump from winning a sweep of the Tuesday primaries with a win in Idaho , while Ohio Gov . John Kasich had a strong showing in Michigan . Cruz edged him out in a very close race for second .\nMeanwhile , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who has won only two contests so far and was pegged by some in the Republican establishment as the party 's best alternative to Trump , had a terrible night Tuesday , placing a distant third or fourth .\nAs of Wednesday , the Republican race stands as follows : Trump now has 446 delegates , Cruz has 347 , Rubio 151 , and Kasich 54 .\nOn the Democratic side , Vermont Sen.
