The arrests happened after a shootout in which one militia member was killed , and another injured .\nAmmon Bundy 's father Cliven Bundy became a Fox News star in 2014 for his armed standoff in Nevada with the federal government over cattle-grazing rights . On the surface , the 2016 wildlife-reserve occupation is about a father and son from Oregon who were ordered by the court to return to prison to serve additional time for a 2012 arson on federal land . But , as with Cliven Bundy 's standoff , the anti-government militiamen driving this crisis believe it 's about standing up to a tyrannical federal government .\nThe apparent goal of the takeover is ultimately to induce the federal government to turn over government-owned land to local ranchers , loggers , and miners for their use .

In fact, at least one militia member seems to be expecting things to go very differently this time. Jon Ritzheimer, the former US Marine whose anti-Muslim rhetoric and activities raised alarms with the FBI in November 2015, posted a video to YouTube on December 31 in which he seemed to be saying goodbye to his family and explaining the reason why he felt compelled to fight the US government in Oregon.
