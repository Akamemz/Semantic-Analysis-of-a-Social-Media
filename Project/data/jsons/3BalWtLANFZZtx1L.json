But a beta app launched by the UK this week shows the huge challenges they face and , crucially , the difficulty in designing an effective app without the help of the tech giants that make our phones .\nThe UK is one of the few countries that has chosen to create a contact-tracing app that is incompatible with the contact-tracing API currently being developed by Google and Apple .
