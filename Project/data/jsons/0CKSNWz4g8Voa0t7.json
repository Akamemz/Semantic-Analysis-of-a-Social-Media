    "content": "When Bill O \u2019 Reilly got his start on Fox News , he was charmingly irreverent , a moderating factor on a right-leaning news network ; and I liked him for it . I was 14 years old , and would go on , in my teen years , to read one of O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s early books , along with Christopher Hitchens \u2019 `` Letters to a Young Contrarian , '' and eventually Dinesh D \u2019 Souza \u2019 s `` Letters to a Young Conservative '' and Friedrich Nietzsche \u2019 s `` Beyond Good and Evil . '' I was hashing out a political identity into my 20s , and , as this awkward reading list suggests , it was complicated . It \u2019 s perhaps a shame that today \u2019 s O \u2019 Reilly is not complicated .\nIn the segment where O \u2019 Reilly calls \u2588\u2588\u2588 a \u201c hate site , \u201d and his program ambushes a handful of San Francisco civil servants , I was struck more by the \u201c talking points memo \u201d working in conjunction with O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s monologue than with the breach of decorum or even the comparison of \u2588\u2588\u2588 to white-supremacist outlet Stormfront . The real danger of that O \u2019 Reilly segment isn \u2019 t so much the ambush tactics or the sensationalism as the sloppy thinking O \u2019 Reilly performs for his viewers , which gives the appearance of justifying that sensationalism .\nFor this reason I \u2019 ve decided to work through that O \u2019 Reilly segment , which \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Scott Eric Kaufman has reported on , paying close attention to those moments when O \u2019 Reilly uses both rhetorical tricks and logical fallacies to convey a provocatively hateful message about undocumented immigrants , a message that , ironically , comes a lot closer to hate speech than the simple act of advocating on either a conservative or progressive media outlet like National Review Online or \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nO \u2019 Reilly kicks off the segment by addressing the \u201c evil \u201d of the coldblooded murder of Kate Steinle before airing a clip of an interview with Steinle \u2019 s parents , who speak of the \u201c battle of evil and goodness. \u201d I mentioned Nietzsche \u2019 s `` Beyond Good and Evil '' above because it \u2019 s a powerful critique of Manichaeism , the belief in a dualistic moral struggle of good versus evil . Manichaeism makes it easy to oversimplify conflicts and tragedies by defining actors as pure good and pure evil . This is exactly what O \u2019 Reilly will go on to do in his \u201c talking points. \u201d He writes , \u201c Every sane person knows that gunning down a 32-year old woman in the street is an act of pure evil. \u201d The memo goes on : \u201c There are many Americans who will not act to prevent that kind of evil from taking place . \u201d\nHere we can see two important rhetorical moves designed to bring audiences to the conclusion that , despite the culpability of the evil man who murdered Steinle , we are to identify that murderous evil both with undocumented immigrants and with people who don \u2019 t agree with O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s hard-line immigration views . O \u2019 Reilly first sets up the scenario as though it \u2019 s as simple as good people versus evil people ( as opposed to , for example , a more complicated policy nexus of immigration and gun control issues ) . Then he swiftly aligns \u201c the Americans who will not move to act to prevent that kind of evil from taking place \u201d with the evil itself . In these steps O \u2019 Reilly effectively conflates the evil of coldblooded murder with the evil of some Americans who will fail to act on some measure that O \u2019 Reilly will assign as a cure for that evil .\nWhat , then , is that measure ? O \u2019 Reilly begins by blaming the media , which \u201c does not oppose sanctuary cities , \u201d \u201c sanctuary city \u201d being a term with no legal meaning that refers generally to cities that don \u2019 t spend city funds and resources to enforce certain federal immigration policies . O \u2019 Reilly claims that the \u201c sanctuary city policy \u201d ( it \u2019 s not a coherent policy at all ) \u201c is supported by people who believe that poor illegal immigrants should not be held accountable for violating immigration law , \u201d \u201c folks cloaking themselves in compassion , thinking they \u2019 re being humane to the poor who want better lives. \u201d Crucially , however , O \u2019 Reilly goes on to re-label these people \u201c hundreds of thousands of bad people . \u201d\nHere we can see , again , O \u2019 Reilly invoking the Manichaean framework with which he started , only this time , the \u201c evil \u201d one isn \u2019 t simply the individual who murdered Kate Steinle , but the \u201c hundreds of thousands \u201d of undocumented immigrants , whom O \u2019 Reilly lumps together as \u201c bad people. \u201d This is the point of O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s slippage from the evil of murder to the evil of being an undocumented immigrant , to use a negative example of one to stand in for the whole . O \u2019 Reilly completes the slippage by claiming that \u201c it is insulting when pro-sanctuary city people equate poor immigrants with violent criminals , \u201d going on to further conflate all undocumented immigrants with violent criminals with one phrase : he calls them \u201c brutal undocumented people . \u201d\nFrom this point , O \u2019 Reilly moves onto San Francisco city supervisors , holding them up as an example of the next link in a tenuously constructed chain of evil that begins with a murderer , who , by his undocumented status , becomes a stand-in for all undocumented immigrants , and ends with the civil servants of San Francisco and the broader left , presumably the kind of people who \u201c will not move to act to prevent that kind of evil from taking place. \u201d O \u2019 Reilly states unequivocally that Kate Steinle \u201c is dead because of policies that endanger the public , \u201d conflating once again the act of murder with the refusal to support O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s specific vision of border security . O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s closing judgment is that \u201c it \u2019 s a damn shame that all Americans can not support a policy that would protect people like Kate Steinle \u2026 if you saw the heartbreaking interview with her parents last night , how could you not support tough measures against criminal illegal aliens ? \u201d\nIn all of this we should note three tactics of distortion . First , by framing the entire issue of Steinle \u2019 s murder as a Manichaean problem of good versus evil , O \u2019 Reilly is able to pretend for his viewers that there can only be one problem ( lax immigration law ) , which is itself a manifestation of evil . Both gun control and wider issues of how to distribute limited city funds and resources ( O \u2019 Reilly isn \u2019 t exactly a fan of higher taxes ) are as significant factors in this tragedy as immigration law .\nSecond , O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s entire argument relies on the fallacy of composition , which presumes that if something is true of a part of a whole , it must then be true of the whole . This is why , because an undocumented immigrant is alleged to have committed a murder , O \u2019 Reilly goes on to call all undocumented immigrants things like \u201c bad people , \u201d \u201c brutal undocumented people , \u201d \u201c violent criminals \u201d and \u201c criminal illegal aliens . \u201d\nThird , O \u2019 Reilly avails himself of the fallacy of false equivalence in two ways . He equates the culpability for murder with the politically mainstream disagreement between San Francisco city officials and O \u2019 Reilly on immigration policy ; and he equates sites like \u2588\u2588\u2588 and MediaMatters with the self-proclaimed white-supremacist outlet Stormfront , confusing yet again mainstream , partisan media outlets with neo-Nazis . A simple test to reveal the fallaciousness of the comparison would be to ask yourself how long a site like \u2588\u2588\u2588 or MediaMatters would exist , drawing articles from prominent policymakers , politicians , artists , academics and journalists , if any of these sites regularly proclaimed white supremacy as its reason for being .\nThough it \u2019 s a little laborious to go through talking points like O \u2019 Reilly \u2019 s in this manner , it \u2019 s important to reverse-engineer them from time to time to expose what lies at the heart of the machine . In this case we find that the source of hatred isn \u2019 t a side of a mainstream political debate about immigration policy , but a desire to paint all undocumented immigrants as murderous villains , \u201c bad people , \u201d \u201c brutal undocumented people \u201d on the side of evil who threaten to put out the white light of America .",
