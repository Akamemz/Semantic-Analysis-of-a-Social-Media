Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( joined by a coterie of Senate Republicans ) spoke on the Senate floor for about 21 hours in opposition to funding the Affordable Care Act , or \u201c Obamacare. \u201d Cruz 's speech was not a filibuster , it had to end before today 's scheduled vote on the Senate 's bill to continue funding the government , and was never a threat to derail legislation that was passed and signed into law three years ago .\nAs such , much of the media coverage of Cruz 's speech has focused on the political circus Cruz has whipped up . Since he could n't actually alter the legislative process and has few supporters on either side of the aisle , it 's not unreasonable to think that Cruz is doing this for his own benefit . Washington Examiner political writer Timothy Carney has sensed this tone in the media coverage of Cruz 's fake filibuster and sounds the familiar \u201c LIBERAL BIAS \u201d klaxon , arguing that Texas state senator Wendy Davis ' ( D ) filibuster to halt passage of a restrictive anti-abortion rights bill this past summer was similar to Cruz 's but \u201c the media spin was different . \u201d\nThe circumstances surrounding Cruz 's and Davis ' speeches , however , are pretty different . \u201c Davis 's filibuster was no more likely than Cruz 's to change the law , \u201d Carney wrote . Perhaps so , but Davis ' filibuster was an extraordinary measure taken in response to extraordinary measures deployed by Gov . Rick Perry and the Republican-dominated legislature . Davis ' filibuster came at the end of a special legislative session convened by Perry specifically to pass the abortion law , and after it failed to pass Perry had to call yet another special session to pass the bill , and a third after that to deal with the business the legislature could n't attend to because it was wrapped up in the abortion debate . Cruz was operating within the regular business of the Senate and there was a hard deadline on how long he could continue .\nPolitically , Davis ' filibuster became a flashpoint in the national abortion debate because it split activists along the well-established lines , and abortion rights supporters worked doggedly to elevate Davis ' profile while opponents worked to marginalize her . It also helped to highlight the intense state-level fights over abortion rights that had not registered on the national media 's radar . With Cruz , that dynamic does n't exist .
