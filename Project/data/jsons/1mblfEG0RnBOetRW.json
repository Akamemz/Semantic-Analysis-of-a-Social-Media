    "content": "As protests over policing continue to convulse cities throughout the U.S. , one symbol keeps showing up : a black-and-white American flag with one blue stripe .\nRecently , the flag was flown from the back of a car alongside protests in South Dakota , and burned outside the Utah State Capitol . When deputies hoisted the flag outside government buildings in Cincinnati , Ohio , and Orange , California , the sheriffs in both communities were sharply criticized . Officers have worn versions of the flag on face masks while clashing with protesters in Baltimore and in Washington , D.C .\nThose who fly the flag have said it stands for solidarity and professional pride within a dangerous , difficult profession and a solemn tribute to fallen police officers . But it has also been flown by white supremacists , appearing next to Confederate flags at the 2017 \u2018 Unite the Right \u2019 rally in Charlottesville , Virginia . County officials in Oregon recently paid $ 100,000 to a black employee of a law enforcement agency there , after she said she was harassed by coworkers for complaining about her colleagues displaying the flag at work .\nNow , as police again become the focal point of a fight for racial equality in the U.S. , the flag has returned to both mirror and amplify divisions .\nBut how did this flag come to be so pervasive ? And what does it really stand for ?\nIn 2014 , a white college student named Andrew Jacob was watching protests of police killings of Eric Garner , Michael Brown and Tamir Rice . He had seen the image of the flag on patches and stickers , he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but not an actual flag . While in high school in West Bloomfield , Michigan , he had attended a memorial service for a police officer who had been killed on the job .\nNow , Jacob is the president of Thin Blue Line USA , one of the largest online retailers devoted exclusively to sales of pro-police flags , T-shirts , neckwear and jewelry . \u201c The flag has no association with racism , hatred , bigotry , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s a flag to show support for law enforcement\u2014no politics involved. \u201d The company officially disavowed its use in Charlottesville .\nJacob said the flag was not a direct reaction to the first Black Lives Matter protests\u2014an idea suggested by a previous origin story in Harper \u2019 s\u2014but he allows he may have first seen the thin blue line image after those protests spurred the circulation of pro-police imagery online . \u201c That \u2019 s maybe why it came to my eyes , \u201d he said .\nAs Jacob built the company , a \u201c Blue Lives Matter \u201d movement was growing in the wake of news stories of multiple officers shot to death in Baton Rouge , Louisiana ; Brooklyn , New York ; and Dallas . Meanwhile , Donald Trump , as a presidential candidate , called police \u201c the force between civilization and total chaos. \u201d Some states began passing laws to categorize physical attacks on law enforcement officers as hate crimes .\nPolice were not actually in greater danger than they had been before the Black Lives Matter movement . Ambush killings of police have actually declined more than 90 percent since 1970 , even with the recent spikes , according to a study by Michael White , a professor of criminology at Arizona State University . White understands how the thin blue line flag has become a part of police culture , and that officers may view it as a sign of solidarity , but also worries about the message it sends to the public .\n\u201c It fosters this \u2018 us versus them \u2019 mentality , \u201d he said . \u201c The police and community should work together , in order to produce safety . Each should respect the role of the other . If you 're looking at the community as a potential enemy , or a threat , that 's certainly going to hinder any positive relationship . \u201d\nBefore the flag came the phrase . The idea of a \u201c thin blue line \u201d can be traced all the way back to a 1854 British battle formation , a \u201c thin red line \u201d used during the Crimean War and then popularized in art , poetry and song . According to lawyers James Clapp and Elizabeth Thornburg , who have dug up the history behind popular phrases , the idea migrated to other professions , with other colors , from a \u201c thin white line of bishops \u201d to a \u201c thin blue line of public schoolboys in blazers . \u201d\nIt was occasionally used for police , they write . But that usage caught on in 1922 , after New York police commissioner Richard Enright , facing criticism of his leadership , mentioned it in a public relations effort . The phrase started showing up in speeches by politicians and related press coverage from Chicago to Los Angeles .\nIn the 1950s , \u201c The Thin Blue Line \u201d was the title of a briefly running television show about the Los Angeles Police Department , masterminded by the chief , William H. Parker , who took advantage of Hollywood \u2019 s proximity to make public relations a key part of his tenure . He also opened up the department \u2019 s files to the writers of \u201c Dragnet . \u201d\nParker was known for unambiguous racism . He said some immigrants were \u201c not far removed from the wild tribes of Mexico \u201d and compared black residents participating in the Watts Riots\u2014which stemmed in part from anger over his own department \u2019 s mistreatment\u2014to \u201c monkeys in a zoo . \u201d\nParker used the phrase \u2018 thin blue line \u2019 constantly in his speeches . The phrase was further popularized by the novels of Joseph Wambaugh , and it typified Parker \u2019 s philosophy : having served in the military , he wanted to end corruption and professionalize the police force .\nIn his view , the police \u201c protected Western civilization from communists , progressive politicians , minorities , anybody who agitated for something that didn \u2019 t fit his very narrow scheme , \u201d said Alisa Kramer , who wrote a 2007 dissertation on Parker 's tenure . `` There are a lot of parallels between Parker and Trump ; Parker had no understanding of the complexities of poverty and racism . ''\nAfter Parker \u2019 s sudden death in 1966 , the city named the police headquarters after him . The Parker Center went on to be a primary site of protests in 1992 after police were filmed beating Rodney King .\nParker \u2019 s tenure augured a bigger shift towards militarism in police departments , which came to buy military gear directly from the Department of Defense . Criminologists Don L. Kurtz and Alayna Colburn have analyzed the language police officers use in formal interviews , and argue that the \u201c thin blue line \u201d idea is an example of popular culture informing internal police culture , highlighting \u201c the assumed differences between officers and citizens and further progresses an \u2018 us versus them \u2019 mentality among officers . \u201d\nThe phrase gained another boost with Errol Morris \u2019 s 1988 film \u201c The Thin Blue Line , \u201d in which a Dallas judge quotes a prosecutor describing what separates \u201c the public from anarchy. \u201d The title was ironic , if not sly , since the film depicted how law enforcement sent an innocent man to death row .\nOver the years , officers around the country occasionally placed stickers of a blue line surrounded by black on their cars . After the ambush of Dallas officers in 2016 , the flag became a common sight in yards and on bumper stickers around the city , along with \u201c Back the Blue \u201d and \u201c Thank a Cop \u201d signs . Mourners wore blue neckties and hair ribbons at the funeral service , but the fallen officers \u2019 caskets were draped with American flags .\nDallas Police Sgt . Stephen Bishopp has a doctorate and has studied police stress , use of force and officer misconduct . The \u201c thin blue line \u201d symbol existed before several of his colleagues were gunned down by a sniper in July 2016 , he said . To him , it symbolizes respect and understanding for the families of officers killed in the line of duty\u2014including suicides .\n\u201c When I see that flag as a sticker on a car or flying in someone \u2019 s yard , I know that there is someone there that knows what I \u2019 m going through . They know because they are a part of the family , \u201d Bishopp said . \u201c I don \u2019 t really care if it bothers people or hurts their feelings to see that flag . I absolutely could care less . I am proud of what I do , the people I work with , and the ones who have died defending the rights of strangers . I will continue to fly that flag until my very last day . \u201d\nSocial media allows for endless remixing , and the offerings now appear infinite . You can buy a sticker that mixes the imagery with the Disney World logo . You can buy a dog tag necklace , with a Matthew 5:9 engraved on the back : \u201c Blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be called children of God. \u201d Law enforcement officers can buy a special edition Sig Sauer pistol covered with the flag and blue line .\nBut as the images have multiplied , so have the meanings .
