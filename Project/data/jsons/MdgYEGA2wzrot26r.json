    "content": "The 2016 New Hampshire presidential primary was the most significant in the 64-year history of that venerable institution , surpassing even the mythic 1968 battle by which Gene McCarthy drove Lyndon Johnson from office . McCarthy didn \u2019 t win the nomination but he did forge a consensus to end what was , until Iraq , our most tragic foreign war . Whether or not Bernie Sanders is nominated , he too is forging a new consensus . The old order is dying ; a new one \u2019 s being born .\nIf you get your news from cable TV you don \u2019 t know any of this . Whatever their age or gender , cable reporters still cover politics like cigar-chomping old men poring over racing forms . History was made under their noses and they still spent the night talking win , place or show , obsessed by the order of finish in the crowded middle of a lame Republican pack . It was a coming out party for a political revolution , but Gil Scott Heron had it right : The revolution will not be televised .\nSanders made history even by the metrics of horse-race journalism . He had the most votes ( 155,578 ) , biggest vote share ( 60.4 percent ) and biggest margin in a contested race ( 22.4 percent ) of any candidate of either party in New Hampshire primary history . As in Iowa , he outperformed late polls by more than their alleged margins of error . Sanders won 55 percent of women , a stunning 84 percent of voters under 30 , and 92 percent of those who say the trait they prize most in a politician is honesty .\nClintonites said Sanders had home-court advantage . ( If you buy that excuse , just ask a friend to name a senator from a neighboring state . ) Hillary may be the world \u2019 s best-known politician after Barack Obama , Vladimir Putin and her husband . It gives her an overwhelming head start in every state but Vermont , which is why she began New Hampshire 30 points up . They made other lame justifications for their loss , but after the flood there was nothing left to spin .\nHow Clinton lost is as telling as the historic margin she lost by . Just as in 2008 , she presented as a hawk to a party bone-weary of war . Now as then , her high-dollar , tone-deaf , leak-prone campaign telegraphed every punch . Her backers harp on her experience -- but experience only counts if you learn from it . Eight years later , Clinton makes the exact same mistakes . Still , party elites have bet the farm she \u2019 ll have it all sorted out by October . Dangerous wager .\nShe isn \u2019 t learning from this race , either . Her response to New Hampshire has been to double-down on her strategy . How such a bright person could be such a slow learner is a mystery . Her worst moments prior to New Hampshire were her ham-handed attempts to take down Sanders . Chelsea distorted his healthcare plans , Bill ripped his character . Hillary accused him of an \u201c artful smear \u201d for suggesting , obviously , that banks give to super PACs to influence policy . She voiced \u201c concern \u201d over reports he \u2019 d mingled with real live lobbyists at Democratic fundraisers . But to many voters the Clintons attacking Sanders ' integrity was like draft-avoider George W. Bush swift-boating Purple Heart-winner John Kerry -- except this time it backfired , and her whole family took the hit .\nAt this point she might have decided to curtail the personal attacks , but alas , no . In a public television debate two days after the primary , she waited till the last second to launch an attack , this time on Sanders \u2019 alleged disloyalty to Obama . It seems this will be a principal theme going forward , so in case you missed , a sample :\nToday Senator Sanders said President Obama failed the presidential leadership test\u2026 . he has called him weak . He has called him a disappointment . He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers ' remorse when it comes to President Obama 's leadership and legacy it is the kind of criticism I expect from Republicans . Calling the president weak\u2026 [ Saying ] several times he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election\u2026\nMuch of this is flat-out false ; all is shorn of context and rife with what Politifact called \u201c half-truths . '' Bill Press wrote a book criticizing Obama , but Sanders didn \u2019 t write the foreword ( just a blurb that doesn \u2019 t criticize Obama ) . He never called Obama weak or a disappointment , though he once said Obama showed weakness in budget negotiations . Talking to a radio host who wanted Obama primaried , Sanders said open debate was a good thing . But notice in the above quote how Clinton , the Mary Lou Retton of syntax , made it seem Sanders said all these things .\nWhen Clinton at last holstered her weapon , moderators Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill , who \u2019 d done yeoman \u2019 s work to that point , said there wasn \u2019 t time for Sanders to answer her final fusillade , but that he could do so in his closing remarks . Off balance for the first time all night , he split the difference , which made for a weak finish to an otherwise strong performance . Too bad ; he deserved a chance at a full rebuttal even if it meant shaving a minute or two off `` Antiques Roadshow . ''\nClinton \u2019 s playing an explosive game , especially since she herself spent much of 2015 sniping at Obama . When Obama described his foreign policy as \u201c Don \u2019 t do stupid stuff , \u201d she ridiculed him . When he wouldn \u2019 t violate international law by declaring a no-fly zone in Syria , she broke with him . She talks a lot about being commander in chief . She must know it \u2019 s hard to be one when your old secretary of state is taking shots at you . Ironically enough , on foreign policy Sanders has been more loyal to Obama than Clinton , but the irony doesn \u2019 t end there .\nAs Hillary laced into Sanders , Bill was miles away lacing into Obama . In a listless swipe at the banking system , he said , \u201c Yeah , it \u2019 s rigged , because you don \u2019 t have a president who \u2019 s a change maker. \u201d It \u2019 s what Hillary accuses Bernie of saying . ( Note too , the tacit admission that Bernie \u2019 s right on Dodd Frank . ) All in all , Hillary looks cunning , not loyal . Because integrity is for her what intelligence was for Dan Quayle , she can ill afford to appear hypocritical or be caught doctoring the truth .\nClinton \u2019 s ad hominem attacks -- call it the politics of personal destruction -- poison the air around her . Just before New Hampshire , deservedly beloved feminist icon Gloria Steinem told Bill Maher that young women join Sanders \u2019 campaign to meet guys . Steinem got taken to the Internet woodshed for making a lighthearted , self-deprecating joke , on a comedy show , no less , but only because the tone of Clinton \u2019 s campaign is so rancid . Clinton must see how her scorched-earth policy hurts her family , her friends and her campaign , but for her there \u2019 s never any turning back .\nIn another reminder of 2008 , Clinton has added race to the mix . On primary night on CNN , Clinton ally Michael Nutter slyly accused Sanders of subtle racism , terming his call for criminal justice reform \u201c mildly offensive \u201d because , Nutter falsely charged , Sanders never talks about other African-American issues . For some reason\u2014 it can \u2019 t be ratings -- CNN lets commentators with clear conflicts of interest mouth thinly veiled partisan message . This is worse . Nutter is no more \u201c offended \u201d than Hillary is \u201c concerned \u201d or Bill \u201c shocked \u201d to discover trolls on the Internet . They want us to think Bernie does what they do , but of course he doesn \u2019 t .\nLots of African-Americans live in upcoming primary states . Because they are the firewall Clinton hopes will save her , she \u2019 ll ratchet this up as high as she can . Last week the Congressional Black Caucus PAC endorsed her . Asked about Sanders \u2019 civil rights record , Rep. John Lewis dryly replied , \u201c I never met him , \u201d and went on to praise Clinton for her close ties to African-American politicians .\nLewis is a hero to me and to millions . Nothing he says or does in a campaign could change that . But Bernie deserves better . It \u2019 s been reported that he and Sanders did meet when Bernie was the sole white member on hand for a hearing Lewis held on voter suppression . Or he might have bumped into him back in the day , when a young Bernie joined the Congress of Racial Equality and braved jail to protest segregated housing in Chicago .\nThe real problem with the Black Caucus PAC endorsement isn \u2019 t anything Lewis said , but the way Washington works . Only seven of 46 caucus members voted on the caucus endorsement but 11 lobbyists voted , including at least two tobacco and two healthcare industry lobbyists . Like the Iowa Democratic Party , the PAC won \u2019 t reveal the tally -- but we know at least two of the seven actual members voted no .\nOn Friday we learned that DNC chairwoman and Clinton lifer Debbie Wasserman Schultz ended Obama \u2019 s ban on federal contractors donating to the party . ( So much for loyalty to Obama . ) On Wednesday we learned Clinton will get a majority of New Hampshire delegates despite losing in a landslide . Schultz told CNN the reason 700 unelected superdelegates get to vote at the convention is to spare grass-roots activists the burden of having to primary them . No matter how much money Schultz wrings from contractors or how many superdelegates Clinton piles up in states Sanders wins , it won \u2019 t equal the price they pay for such cynicism .\nTo the extent Clinton gets away with it , she can thank a media nearly as out of touch as she is . Newspapers beat TV for analysis , but the gap narrows every year , and not because TV is getting better . Elite reporters reflect the elite consensus , which accounts for such recent Washington Post headlines as `` Democrats Would Be Insane to Nominate Sanders '' and `` Sanders \u2019 Oddball Coalition Savors Its Victory . ''\nIt may explain the boffo reviews of Clinton \u2019 s PBS debate performance , as in the Times headline , `` Analysis : Clinton Is Cool , Calm and Effective . '' Pundits praised her superior grasp of policy partly out of habit -- it was true of earlier debates -- but also because it \u2019 s how they see the world . They should read the transcript . If anything , Bernie does the better job of explaining how he \u2019 d fund his programs . Hillary won \u2019 t say how she \u2019 d pay for Social Security . She says she has a universal healthcare plan but she doesn \u2019 t . She has a laundry list of programs , one for each demographic , all with unanswered questions about implementation , effectiveness and affordability .\nThe most striking thing about the debate , other than the low blow Clinton struck at the end of the last round , was that Sanders got the better of her on foreign policy . Has any other presidential candidate ever told the American people that Iran doesn \u2019 t \u201c hate us for our freedom \u201d but because we engineered the violent overthrow of their democratically elected president and installed a vicious tyrant in his place ? The rest of the world knows , why not us ? Is Clinton \u2019 s jingoism about not talking to Iran the signal we want to send to thousands of Iranians who joyously took to the streets to celebrate the nuclear weapons pact ? Shouldn \u2019 t Clinton \u2019 s airbrushing of the hyper-secretive , lawbreaking Kissinger concern us ? Has anyone but Bernie ever said Henry Kissinger \u2019 s China opening may have cost us some jobs ? Clinton mocks him for citing her Iraq vote but he now casts a wider net . Pundits citing her foreign policy cred should feel honor-bound to tell us why she \u2019 s right and he \u2019 s wrong .\nThe press doesn \u2019 t understand any better than Hillary what made New Hampshire historic . They \u2019 re great at figuring out who \u2019 s ahead in South Carolina , but awful at grasping -- let alone conveying -- the terms of the new debate .\nIt \u2019 s too soon to describe that debate whole , but among Democrats at least it has begun to clarify . A word about it , and what it means to this race .\nThirty years ago , reeling from the Reagan Revolution , elite Democrats rebranded their party , which had long championed both economic and cultural liberalism . They kept cultural liberalism , but ditched economic liberalism for `` neoliberalism '' ; a blend of economic deregulation , free trade , smaller government and targeted tax cuts . Few said it out loud , but it was the end of the Roosevelt coalition , which had been built on economic issues of universal appeal and which had lasted 50 years .\nNeoliberalism appeals to the rich . Neoliberal Bill Clinton was the first Democratic presidential nominee to outspend a Republican . In 2008 Obama outspent John McCain 2-to-1 , breaking a record set in 1972 by Richard Nixon . But neoliberalism is killing the middle class . It \u2019 s why both parties rely on cultural issues to hold their bases . If you back abortion rights , same sex marriage and gun safety you \u2019 re a Democrat . If not , you \u2019 re a Republican . On economic issues it \u2019 s more complex . If you hate big banks and political corruption , you could be for Sanders or Trump . It \u2019 s why Sanders talks so much about these things ; they \u2019 re what the election \u2019 s all about .\nWhen Clinton isn \u2019 t calling Sanders a traitor , she says she shares his goals . But she does n't . Clinton was part of the neoliberal revolt that destroyed the Roosevelt coalition and she is as we \u2019 ve seen , a woman of markedly fixed views . She may be Obama \u2019 s heir , but Sanders is FDR \u2019 s . She campaigns as she does out of habit , and to hide the very real choice . The neoliberal experiment is over . Democrats , proud heirs to Franklin Roosevelt , are ready to come home .",
