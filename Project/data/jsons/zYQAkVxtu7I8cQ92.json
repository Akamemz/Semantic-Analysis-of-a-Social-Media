Now , as President Trump trails in the polls , Democrats see an opportunity to take back power .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Election Forecast is a long-term , qualitative examination of the political landscape , from the presidential campaign down to the congressional-district level . It is based on continual interviews with strategists and operatives , polling and other data streams and the electoral and demographic trends driving the 2020 campaign . It is a more deliberative approach than a statistical model , which can be helpful in cutting through polls and other data sources but can also shift from day-to-day with little rationale for the changes .\nFrom the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic , Trump \u2019 s standing with voters has suffered , with a majority disapproving of his handling of the emergency . But with Americans more dissatisfied than ever after four months since the coronavirus became a dominant force in the country \u2014 and with the same period of time to go until Election Day \u2014 the shift toward Democrats is both real and durable , though it \u2019 s not irreversible .\nThe signs are apparent : Trump \u2019 s campaign is running ads in states he won handily in 2016 , like Georgia and Ohio . Senate Republicans aren \u2019 t just playing defense in vulnerable seats in states like Colorado , Maine and North Carolina \u2014 they \u2019 re also retrenching in places like Iowa and Montana .\nMeanwhile , Trump \u2019 s incumbent advantages \u2014 money and the bully pulpit of the presidency \u2014 are eroding . Biden \u2019 s fundraising has surpassed Trump \u2019 s over the past two months , though Trump \u2019 s campaign retains a cash-on-hand edge . Trump \u2019 s poll numbers on the coronavirus and the civil unrest regarding racial injustice are consistently underwater , suggesting Americans believe he has failed to lead on the two dominant issues facing the country .\nIt could all add up to a potentially disastrous November for Republicans up and down the ballot if the president \u2019 s numbers don \u2019 t recover . There is still time for that to happen \u2014 and a plausible path for Trump to win an Electoral College majority and the GOP to keep the Senate . But it has grown much less likely .\nThe most consequential changes to the forecast are four one-time toss up states moving to \u201c Lean Democratic \u201d : Michigan , Nevada , New Hampshire and Pennsylvania . Adding those four to Biden \u2019 s column , along with bluer states , would put the Democrat at 268 electoral votes , just shy of the majority needed to clinch the presidency .\nMichigan and Pennsylvania are the second- and fourth-largest states Trump flipped to the Republican column in 2016 \u2014 and along with Wisconsin , which remains as a toss up , they have been at the heart of Democrats \u2019 strategy to win back the presidency . Biden had double-digit leads in all three states in the most recent high-quality polls , from The New York Times and Siena College \u2014 but most observers see Wisconsin as the most Republican-friendly of the three .\nNevada and New Hampshire were states Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 \u2014 and with Biden posting larger leads against Trump , they have moved further from the president \u2019 s grasp .\nThe states remaining in the toss up column are Arizona , Florida , North Carolina and Wisconsin , along with two competitive congressional districts in Maine and Nebraska , where electoral votes are split by district . In each of those places , recent public and private polling has showed Biden leading Trump , though it \u2019 s too early to say the Democrat is a significant favorite .\nMeanwhile , as Biden \u2019 s lead over Trump has increased over the past few months , the list of battlegrounds has expanded . Trump \u2019 s campaign is now spending significant resources in states the president carried comfortably in 2016 : Georgia , Iowa and Ohio .\nAll three are still classified as \u201c Lean Republican \u201d in \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s forecast , as polling shows the two candidates neck-and-neck , even with Biden opening up a sizable national lead . If they are toss-up states on Election Day , it would essentially foreclose Trump \u2019 s path to a second term .\nTrump \u2019 s advertising spend also includes small buys in Minnesota and New Mexico , two states Clinton carried . Minnesota remains classified as Lean Democratic ; it \u2019 s not difficult to imagine Trump winning it if his national standing improves . New Mexico is rated as Likely Democratic .\nRepublicans entered the 2020 Senate election cycle with greater exposure \u2014 including special elections , they control 23 of the 35 seats on the ballot this fall \u2014 but with some significant advantages . The GOP holds a three-seat majority , but only two of the GOP-held seats up this year are in states Clinton carried in 2016 .
