He called the discussions a \u201c very positive development . \u201d\n\u201c They want to make a deal . That \u2019 s a great thing , \u201d he said .\nNews of the possible opening in negotiations came shortly after Trump threatened to declare a national emergency that would result in American businesses freezing their relationships with China . Trump 's tariff barrage on Friday was a response to China imposing its own retaliatory tariffs on $ 75 billion in U.S. goods .\nAt the Group of Seven summit in France on Sunday , White House officials rejected suggestions the president was wavering and insisted that his only regret was not implementing even more tariffs on China . Trump wrote on Twitter that world leaders at the G-7 were `` laughing '' at all the inaccurate media coverage of the gathering .\nIn response , Chinese Vice Premier Liu He told a state-controlled newspaper on Monday that `` China is willing to resolve its trade dispute with the United States through calm negotiations and resolutely opposes the escalation of the conflict , '' Reuters first reported , citing a transcript of his remarks provided by the Chinese government . Liu is China 's top trade negotiator .\nSpeaking at a technology conference in China , Liu added : \u201c We believe that the escalation of the trade war is not beneficial for China , the United States , nor to the interests of the people of the world . ''\nWHITE HOUSE : TRUMP 'S 'SECOND THOUGHTS ' ON CHINA TRADE WAR 'GREATLY MISINTERPRETED '\n\u201c We welcome enterprises from all over the world , including the United States , to invest and operate in China , \u201d Liu said . \u201c We will continue to create a good investment environment , protect intellectual property rights , promote the development of smart intelligent industries with our market open , resolutely oppose technological blockades and protectionism , and strive to protect the completeness of the supply chain . \u201d\nAsian shares tumbled early Monday , with Japan 's benchmark Nikkei 225 started plummeting as soon as trading began and stood at 20,234.87 in the morning session , down 2.3 percent .

''\nOn Sunday , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that if `` China would agree to a fair and balanced relationship , we would sign that deal in a second . ''\nStephen Innes , managing partner at Valour Markets in Singapore , compared the difficulty of assessing the volatile market situation to reading tea leaves .\n`` Nobody understands where the president is coming from , '' he said , adding that the best thing Trump can do for market stability is to `` keep quiet . ''\n`` The problem that we 're faced right now is that we are making a lot of assumptions ahead of the economic realities . ''\nThe market is now dominated by fears of a portending U.S. recession , although the American economy is actually holding up , and much of the U.S. economy is made up of consumption , Innes said .
