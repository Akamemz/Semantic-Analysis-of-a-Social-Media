    "content": "Freshman year can make anyone feel lost , but Seattle teen Janelle Gary felt especially lost when she entered high school in 2015 . At home , she watched a wave of gentrification drive change in the historically black Central District neighborhood , and at school , where she was one of the few students of color in an honors history class , she felt as if black perspectives were also in the minority .\nLooking back at that time , as now-18-year-old freshman at Central Washington University , she feels her teacher was \u201c tip-toeing \u201d around hard race-related questions about history . But things were different in her Ethnic Studies class , where her teacher Jesse Hagopian remembered what it was like to be the only black kid in a class .\nThat memory \u2014 and the lasting impact of a college class that looked at race head-on \u2014 is part of the reason why Hagopian , 41 , and other educators inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement organized a national Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action . What started locally in Seattle in 2016 , inspired by a federal investigation into the higher rate of suspensions of black students compared to their white peers , has grown into a nationwide organizing effort .\nIn 2020 , for the second year in a row , teachers \u2014 including in the country \u2019 s three largest school districts , in New York City , Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 will wear \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d shirts to school as they teach lessons on black history and race issues from Feb. 3 to Feb. 7 . The organizers are also calling for Black History and Ethnic Studies to be a graduation requirement in K-12 schools .\nTheirs is not a new call to action . They are driven by the same feeling James Baldwin described in 1963 : \u201c I began to be bugged by the teaching of American history , because it seemed that history had been taught without cognizance of my presence. \u201d It is also the same feeling that in 1926 drove Carter G. Woodson , who is known as \u201c the Father of Black History , \u201d to urge educators to set aside a week in February \u201c for the purpose of emphasizing what has already been learned about the Negro during the year \u201d ; what he started became Black History Month in 1976 .\nAnd yet , from that old feeling , they are helping Black History Month \u2014 and the year-round teaching of the topic \u2014 evolve to a new stage .\n\u201c I definitely think that Black Lives Matter encouraged people to learn about other movements that came before , \u201d says Tatiana Amaya , 19 , a freshman at Claremont McKenna College who took a required black history course in her Philadelphia high school . \u201c It \u2019 s central to understanding that black oppression still exists today . \u201d\nCarter G. Woodson knew about history . After all , in 1912 he became the second African American to earn a PhD in history from Harvard , after only W.E.B . DuBois . So he could see that history was being distorted \u2014 especially , in 1915 , by The Birth of a Nation .

Woodson \u2019 s Negro History Bulletin also circulated to churches and public schools . The civil rights movement of the \u2019 50s , \u2019 60s and \u2019 70s led to further growth of this discipline , even inspiring student walkouts calling for black history classes , and the social movements of that period led to a shift toward teaching that history through the stories of ordinary people who laid the groundwork for larger change . By the time Black History Month was formally declared in 1976 , the Black Power movement had fueled a new emphasis on \u201c what \u2019 s unique about being a black person in America , \u201d says Higginbotham .\nAnd many educators say that , just as a moment of crisis for African Americans fueled Woodson \u2019 s original vision , this moment in time is proving to be a new turning point for black history as a discipline .\n\u201c Whenever there \u2019 s a tragedy in black America , there \u2019 s always been an uptick of black history courses , most recently [ with ] Black Lives Matter and police shootings , \u201d says LaGarrett King , Professor of Social Studies Education and Founding Director of the Carter Center for K12 Black History Education at the University of Missouri . Social media has fueled discussion among teachers on how to contextualize these current events , such as Twitter hashtags like # FergusonSyllabus , # CharlestonSyllabus and # CharlottesvilleSyllabus , and teachers say that current events have piqued students \u2019 interests , especially after Colin Kaepernick \u2019 s kneeling during the national anthem .\n\u201c I have spent so much time talking about Black Lives Matter over the last two years and I \u2019 ve had to weave Black Lives Matter into my lectures on various topics because students \u2014 both K-12 and college level \u2014 heard about the movement , \u201d says Keisha N. Blain , a historian who co-founded the # CharlestonSyllabus , \u201c and they wanted to figure out how does this connect to what happened in the \u2019 60s or even earlier . \u201d\nStep Into History : Learn how to experience the 1963 March on Washington in virtual reality\nBut for the most part , educators say , K-12 students who do learn about black history are hearing about the same few historical figures over and over : Martin Luther King Jr. , Rosa Parks , Harriet Tubman and former President Barack Obama . While those lives are undoubtedly worthy of study , they do not exist in a vacuum .\nThat \u2019 s why LaGarrett King describes the state of the teaching of black history in schools as \u201c steadily improving , yet still stagnant . \u201d\n\u201c One of the problems with getting black history right is we are still trying to use this notion that black history is American history , which sounds good , \u201d says King . But , he says , that creates a problem when American history is taught , as it often is , as a story in which \u201c every generation has improved our society . \u201d\nThe problem with that perspective can be seen , for example , in the teaching of the 20th century civil rights movement , which tends to be where black history ends in many American schools , says Christopher Busey , a University of Florida professor who has researched Black History in social studies standards . When the narrative ends at the victories of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act , it can be hard for students to make the connection between that optimistic ending and the problems of today . \u201c When we have more contemporary movements such as Black Lives Matter , people are largely unable to make sense of it because we skipped the war on drugs with Reagan and the targeting of black communities by police , \u201d he says . \u201c Their last conceptions of black citizenship are tied to this idea that we all had a dream , we overcame , and Obama was elected President . \u201d\nIn addition , black stories often end up told through a white lens . Stories of black people resisting white supremacy in any way other than nonviolent protest may be left out , while the study of oppression can crowd out the study of African contributions to society , from the libraries and intellectual life of Timbuktu to the earliest calendars and forms of mathematics .\n\u201c If the first time that black people enter the school curriculum is through when they \u2019 re enslaved , \u201d says King , \u201c that gives the impression these particular people were not that important to American democracy and didn \u2019 t contribute to the intellectual development of the country . \u201d\nParadoxically , while slavery and the civil rights movement may be the most recognizable black history subject areas , the quality of what students are learning about these topics has come into question recently . A 2018 survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that only 8 % of high school seniors could identify slavery as the main cause of the Civil War . The same organization produced a 2014 \u201c report card \u201d on state standards and resources on the teaching of the history of the civil rights movement nationwide , and gave 20 states a failing grade . The biggest issue across the board was \u201c sanitized \u201d history , including resources that made it sound as if civil rights was just a Southern problem , and a lack of sufficient discussion about the hard realities of the violent resistance to the movement .\nGet your history fix in one place : sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\nNow , however , there are signs of change . Many people in the mostly-white U.S. teacher population haven \u2019 t taken a dedicated course in black history and are learning as they go , but Ursula Wolfe-Rocca , 44 , a white high-school social studies teacher who teaches black history lessons year-round at a predominantly white school district in the Portland , Ore. , area , says it \u2019 s crucial that educators become better equipped to teach the subject . Otherwise , \u201c it reinforces the fundamental flaw , which is that black history is seen as peripheral , \u201d she says . \u201c The answer to why do white kids need black history is that it is history and it \u2019 s their history too . It \u2019 s a shared collective past . \u201d\nSeven states launched commissions designed to oversee state mandates to teach black history in public schools in recent years , and Illinois requires public colleges and universities to offer black history courses . To meet the rising demand for resources , at least six Black History textbooks are on the market , as well as lesson plans on websites including Teaching Tolerance , Teaching for Change , Zinn Education Project and Rethinking Schools . ( The most-downloaded lessons from the Zinn Education Project website for most of 2019 were about Reconstruction . )\nIn 2005 , Philadelphia became the first major American city to require students to take a black history class to graduate . Confining black history lessons to February , as many schools do , is \u201c the exact opposite \u201d of what Woodson envisioned , says Greg Carr , Chair of the Department of Afro-American Studies at Howard University , who led the team that developed the Philadelphia curriculum .\nIn addition , to give students more perspective on black experiences worldwide , an Advanced Placement seminar on the African Diaspora , developed by Columbia University \u2019 s Teachers College , the University of Notre Dame and Tuskegee University , is being piloted in 11 schools in the 2019-2020 year , up from two in 2017-2018 school year . There are also lesson plans available based on Henry Louis Gates Jr. \u2019 s 2017 PBS documentary Africa \u2019 s Great Civilizations .\nData on the impact of learning African and African-American history are hard to come by , but there are already indications that new curricula are making a difference for some students . In the 2018-2019 school year , for example , 80 % of students \u2014 including under-performing students \u2014 in five schools that offered the AP African Diaspora pilot passed , according to Kassie Freeman , who played a key role in developing the seminar and is a senior faculty fellow at the Institute for Urban and Minority Education at Teachers College and President of the African Diaspora Consortium .\nSome of the impact is harder to quantify , but no less real .\nAfter taking Philadelphia \u2019 s required class in 9th grade , Maye-gan Brown , now a 22-year-old Muhlenberg College senior , realized \u201c how much we center black men when it comes to civil rights , \u201d she says . \u201c A lot of the time we left out women like Fannie Lou Hamer. \u201d Since Philadelphia teacher Abigail Henry , 36 , started organizing mock trials on subjects such as whether George Washington \u201c promoted the institution of slavery , \u201d she \u2019 s noticed that students who are usually quiet and withdrawn have earned some of the highest grades . Makaia Loya , 17 , a student in Denver , says it was a lesson about Malcolm X \u2019 s 1964 speech \u201c The Ballot or the Bullet \u201d that reshaped her career goals : \u201c I grew up thinking , \u2018 I \u2019 m getting as far as I can from the ghetto , ' \u201d she says , \u201c and now I \u2019 m like , as soon as I Ieave and have something to bring back , I \u2019 m coming back. \u201d And Pascagoula , Miss. , senior Kinchasa Anderson , 18 , says that a field trip last fall to Medgar Evers \u2018 house in Jackson , Miss. , gave her a new appreciation for how that history affects her life today .\n\u201c It just struck me \u2014 these people really put their life on the line for us , \u201d she says , \u201c for my generation , for generations to come . \u201d\nAnd in that feeling , these students are themselves part of the connection between history and lived experience . As Jeanne Theoharis writes in The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks , Rosa Parks \u2019 political awakening began at a young age , when she learned what an understanding of black history could do .\n\u201c The revelation of black history would indelibly shape Rosa McCauley Parks \u2019 s life , \u201d Theoharis writes . \u201c She saw the history of black survival , accomplishment , and rebellion as the ultimate weapon against white supremacy . \u201d\nThe original version of this story misstated which social media resources guide historian Keisha N. Blain co-founded . It was # CharlestonSyllabus , not # CharlottesvilleSyllabus .",

Makaia Loya, 17, a student in Denver, says it was a lesson about Malcolm X\u2019s 1964 speech \u201cThe Ballot or the Bullet\u201d that reshaped her career goals: \u201cI grew up thinking, \u2018I\u2019m getting as far as I can from the ghetto,'\u201d she says, \u201cand now I\u2019m like, as soon as I Ieave and have something to bring back, I\u2019m coming back.\u201d And Pascagoula, Miss., senior Kinchasa Anderson, 18, says that a field trip last fall to Medgar Evers\u2018 house in Jackson, Miss., gave her a new appreciation for how that history affects her life today.\n\n\u201cIt just struck me \u2014 these people really put their life on the line for us,\u201d she says, \u201cfor my generation, for generations to come.\u201d\n\nAnd in that feeling, these students are themselves part of the connection between history and lived experience. As Jeanne Theoharis writes in The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks, Rosa Parks\u2019 political awakening began at a young age, when she learned what an understanding of black history could do.\n\n\u201cThe revelation of black history would indelibly shape Rosa McCauley Parks\u2019s life,\u201d Theoharis writes. \u201cShe saw the history of black survival, accomplishment, and rebellion as the ultimate weapon against white supremacy.\u201d\n\nCorrection, Jan. 31\n\nThe original version of this story misstated which social media resources guide historian Keisha N.
