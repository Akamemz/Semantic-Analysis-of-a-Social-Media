In the case argued Tuesday and another to be heard on Wednesday , the nine justices could fundamentally alter how American law treats marriage .\nOn one extreme , the court could extend a constitutional right for gays and lesbians to wed in all 50 states . On the other , it could deal a major setback to the gay rights movement . And then there are options in between .\n`` This was a deeply divided Supreme Court , and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here , '' said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin .\nToobin was among those who followed 80 minutes of arguments Tuesday over California 's Proposition 8 , which bans same-sex marriage . Voters approved the proposal 52 % to 48 % in November 2008 , less than six months after the state Supreme Court ruled marriage is a fundamental right that must be extended to same-sex couples .\nThe overriding legal question in the California case , Hollingsworth v. Perry ( 12-144 ) , is whether the Constitution 's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage as that state has .\nFrom their questioning , it appeared evident how a few justices were leaning . Four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California . Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that it should only be for a man and a woman , and it 's likely they 'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas , who does n't speak at arguments .\nThat could leave Justice Anthony Kennedy as , has often been the case , the swing vote .\nHe was among those who weighed in on whether the advocacy group appointed to defend the initiative has standing to argue the case .\nWhile admitting the law 's defenders are `` not just any citizens , '' Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said it is the state 's responsibility -- through its elected leaders -- to defend laws in court , and that private individuals could not establish `` how their injury was separate from everyone else . '' California Attorney General Kamala Harris , the state 's top lawyer , said Tuesday she `` declined to defend Proposition 8 because it violates the Constitution . ''\nIf the court dismisses the appeal on the grounds its defenders do n't have the standing to defend the case in court , it may mean lower federal court rulings declaring the proposition unconstitutional would stand .\nBut it would n't allow for a broader , final rule outlining the power of states to say who can or ca n't get married .\nThe justices did probe that broader legal question , including an exchange between pro-Proposition 8 attorney Charles Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan .\n`` The concern is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution will sever its abiding connection to its historic traditional procreative purposes , and it will ... refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of children and to the emotional needs and desires ... of adult couples , '' Cooper argued .\nTo which Kagan said : `` Mr. Cooper , suppose a state said that , because 'we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation , we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55 .
