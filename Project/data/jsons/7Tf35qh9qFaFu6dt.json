    "content": "As America 's newspapers shrink and die , the New York Times only grows in importance . It is effectively America 's last truly national newspaper . Its coverage decisions influence the coverage decisions of every other paper and all television news broadcasts , cable and network . Politicians and executives read it . What the Times says and does frames the allowable political conversation .\nWhich is why it is so annoying that the Times has a terrible opinion section .\nDo n't get me wrong , it is not as bad at the Washington Post 's opinion section , but the Times -- specifically its slate of regular columnists -- is bad . And that badness matters . The president and most of the sane members of Congress care what the Times and its opinion-makers say . The opinions of these columnists have consequences . But most of them do n't write like people who ought to be entrusted with that responsibility .\nWhat 's most galling is that the Times actually does have standards . They rarely add new columnists , keeping the roster fairly exclusive . They went after Ta-Nehisi Coates , which indicates that someone over there can recognize intelligent writing . They even notoriously declined to renew Bill Kristol 's contract after a year of truly awful , phoned-in work . ( He went , naturally , to the Post . )\nThe decision to kick Kristol to the curb , again , suggests some understanding of this responsibility . But it is a blinkered one . Kristol 's crimes , in addition to being a bad writer and human being , were mainly due to sloppiness . He misstated facts regularly and did n't disclose his ties to the subjects he wrote about . Do you know who else is routinely guilty of this kind of sloppiness , not to mention rote repetition of themes and jokes and incredibly lazy thinking ? Op-ed superstar Maureen Dowd .\nJust last year , Dowd nearly sabotaged the New York City mayoral campaign of Bill de Blasio by flagrantly misquoting the candidate 's wife , Chirlane McCray . She also got the name of the diner in which she conducted the interview wrong . This was n't one blemish on an otherwise sterling record . Dowd routinely misquotes people . Perhaps the most egregious example : In 2004 , Dowd wrote that John Kerry said `` who among us does n't like NASCAR ? '' She used quotation marks and everything . That quote is still famous , and most people who remember it still almost certainly think Kerry said it .\nExcept he did n't . He said something much more boring and normal . He said : `` There is n't one of us here who does n't like NASCAR and who isn \u2019 t a fan. \u201d That is still a dubious assertion , coming from John Kerry , but it 's not the weirdo rich guy robot talk Dowd put in the mouth of a presidential candidate .\nDowd has also `` inadvertently '' plagiarized , something that is bound to happen eventually to a columnist who literally copies and pastes , unaltered , entire passages of text from emails from friends into `` her '' columns . Why is this allowed to happen ? How does Dowd keep her job ? Is it because her wisdom and insight are so valuable , so irreplaceable , that it 's worth putting up with the occasional flagrant violation of journalistic ethics ?\nTo answer that question , I will simply let you know that she recently wrote a column with the headline `` Game of Drones , '' and much of this column was for some reason about a proposed sequel to the film `` Top Gun . '' She also recently wrote that Barack Obama has `` got a swag gap with Russia . '' ( OK , just one more : `` Top Democrats who used to consider Obama one cool cat now muse that he \u2019 s 'one weird cat , ' as one big shot put it . '' )\nI can at least understand Dowd 's appeal and audience . I ca n't even imagine a devoted reader of half of the Times ' stable of opinion writers .\nThe decision to give a column -- ostensibly a political column -- to Frank Bruni is hard to explain from the outside . Bruni spent years as the Times ' chief food critic , and he was fine at it . Before that , though , he shadowed George W. Bush on the campaign trail in 2000 , where he produced some of the shallowest horse-race coverage of a campaign that was full of shallow horse-race coverage . The experience later led to a book about how gosh-darn nice ( and smart ! ) President Bush was . The book is also a tacit admission that Bruni 's coverage of Bush was soft because of his personal affinity for the candidate . Al Gore , whom the press did not like , was not treated quite so kindly by Bruni .\nIt was probably easy for Bruni to overlook Bush 's conservative politics , because Bruni appears to have absolutely no politics of his own . He barely has opinions , except about food . My friend Hamilton Nolan has dedicated himself to documenting Bruni 's complete aimlessness as a columnist . Bruni will sometimes note that , say , Grover Norquist is a teensy bit of an extremist , but he is clearly more comfortable writing ambling reflections on visits to Rome and movies he saw . Have you noticed how mass culture has become fragmented because of the Internet ? Frank Bruni noticed this when some young people did not know who Vanessa Redgrave is . Did you know that the Senate is dysfunctional ? Frank Bruni did , and he talked to Bob Kerrey , so he should know .\nBruni the columnist makes even less sense than Bill Keller the columnist did . Keller , the former editor of the Times , recently ( and thankfully ) left the paper to join a journalism nonprofit , saving me the trouble of going back through his work to explain what was so bad about it .\nRoger Cohen is , at least , not Richard Cohen . He is a very conventional foreign affairs-minded columnist who is notable for having most of Thomas Friedman 's beliefs but ( to his credit ) none of his style . Twice a week he will warn that America is not exercising its power correctly in Europe , the Middle East or Russia . Or , like Friedman , he 'll offer up a brief , insulting dissertation on the `` Arab mind . ''\nThe former business columnist Joe Nocera is best when he sticks to business ( and , sometimes , college athletics ) . It 's unclear why anyone would seek out his take on , say , Pussy Riot .\nThen there is poor David Brooks , a man who seems genuinely tired of himself and ought to have his column killed primarily to put him out of his misery . Brooks is the sort of conservative Times editors are n't embarrassed to publish , though they probably ought to be . He is devoted to furthering the notion that there is an honest and useful intellectual wing of the conservative movement , dedicated to addressing economic iniquities and so on , but he has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he ca n't still think it 's going to happen soon . Lately he seems happiest writing discursive pieces on the meaning of self , which does not seem like the most optimal use of some of the most coveted media real estate in the world .\nThomas Friedman writes stupid things , for stupid people , about complicated topics . He makes everything sound simple enough for simple men to understand . He dutifully pushes a stultifyingly predictable center-right agenda , refuses to acknowledge or atone for his role in the selling of the Iraq War , and still believes that `` globalization '' -- a process that , conveniently , makes his richest readers richer -- will the save the world , one sweatshop at a time . Thomas Friedman is an embarrassment . ( And some Times staffers , to their credit , are embarrassed . )\nRoss Douthat is a thoughtful writer who usually engages sincerely with liberal ideas and thinkers -- which , you know , should n't be a particularly notable trait for a serious opinion writer , but this is the modern conservative movement we 're talking about . Douthat 's conservatism is idiosyncratic only in that it is espoused by a seemingly smart person . It is always uncomfortable to see him argue against marijuana legalization and his attempts to argue for some sort of compelling reason to oppose state recognition of same-sex marriage have not grown less lame over time . Douthat 's usual approach , when it comes to matters related to his social conservatism , is to argue that society suffers when individuals are permitted too much freedom . It 's a tough sell ! Especially when you 're demanding that women crank out babies to save Western Civilization .\nNick Kristof , the famous superhero , flies about the world rescuing women . Sometimes that rescuing takes the form of `` getting women arrested for sex work , '' or `` getting them jobs in sweatshops to produce cheap consumer goods for Americans in appalling conditions . '' That sort of exploitation is , to Kristof , more preferable than the other kind . His do-gooder liberalism also involves the bizarre American conviction that bombing places is a great way to help them . In a way he represents America 's own delusions about its power , and the supposed beneficence with which it exercises that power , in columnist form .\nThese tired hacks have a near-monopoly on political opinion writing in the most important newspaper in the world . They set the boundaries of the debate among the elite , and the elite have not lately given us much reason to think that they are receiving great advice .\nThe result is a lineup in which Gail Collins -- Gail Collins of the mostly predictable liberal politics and breezy style -- is one of the good ones . She is , certainly , funnier than all the rest of the Times columnists ( besides Friedman ) . There is Charles Blow , who is generally right about things , though to call his style dry is almost an understatement .\nAnd then there is Paul Krugman , who would be the most influential columnist in the country if it were n't for the fact that elected officials routinely refuse to listen to him . Poor Paul Krugman , our Sisyphus of elite opinion , eternally doomed to the same arguments with the same people , forever .",
