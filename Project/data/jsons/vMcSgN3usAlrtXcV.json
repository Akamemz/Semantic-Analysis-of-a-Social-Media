The impact has been particularly significant in sports, where athletes, teams and leagues are reexamining where they fit in the larger fight against injustice.\n\nThe past several weeks have seen unprecedented changes in the sports world. The NFL\u2019s commissioner admitted the league was wrong for not listening to players about racism amid the controversy sparked by Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protest in 2016. NASCAR banned images of the Confederate flag from its events. College football players have called out coaches and universities for perceived racism. Some prominent NBA players have suggested they might sit out the league\u2019s return to play in order to focus on social justice.\n\nSports have been at the center of social movements throughout modern American history. Black athletes like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Muhammad Ali, whose talent gave them a platform often denied to other members of their race, were some of the most influential voices in the 1960s and \u201970s. During the 1980s and \u201990s, however, many of the most prominent stars avoided controversy to protect their business interests. \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers too,\u201d Michael Jordan famously said in 1990.\n\nToday\u2019s athletes are taking a more active role. Some of the country\u2019s most high-profile athletes have spoken out in favor of Black Lives Matter. Others are leveraging their position to push for systemic change. NBA superstar LeBron James, for example, has started an organization to promote voting rights ahead of the upcoming election.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nThere is, of course, a group that prefers to keep politics entirely out of sports, but polling shows most Americans support athletes\u2019 right to protest. Sports stars have always been influential, but players today have reached a level of global notoriety that would have been unimaginable a few decades ago. With that, some argue, comes a duty to stand up against injustice.\n\nKaepernick provides an example of both the power athletes have to raise awareness and the risks that come with speaking out. His protest brought intense attention to the issue of police violence, but it also contributed to his ouster from the NFL. History offers several examples of players who have lost their careers after taking controversial stances.

The business of sports is seen by many as a prime example of the inequities in broader society. Players in the biggest leagues may be predominately Black, but most owners and top-level executives are white.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nThe current movement has come during a unique period in which all major U.S. sports have been idle because of the coronavirus pandemic. It remains to be seen whether the resumption of games, if and when that occurs, will temper or possibly escalate activism by players.\n\nMajor League Soccer is scheduled to be the first prominent team sport to return, on July 8. The NBA, WNBA and NHL are set to resume play at the end of July, though significant questions remain unanswered about each league\u2019s plan to protect players and staff from the virus.\n\nPerspectives\n\nStaying silent isn\u2019t an option\n\n\u201cAs anti-racism protests sweep across the world, sports are finding they can't stay out of politics.\u201d \u2014 Ali Walker, Politico\n\nSports can help keep social justice in the public conversation\n\n\u201cThese are not pleasant conversations to have.
