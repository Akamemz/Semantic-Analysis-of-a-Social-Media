Four years later , the contrast with Mr. Obama \u2019 s role in the current midterm campaign is stark , and it underscores the limited value the Democratic Party is placing on its leader this election .\nOn Thursday night , Mr. Obama was in the backyard of actress Gwyneth Paltrow \u2019 s Los Angeles home , speaking to a small group of wealthy donors far from the spotlight .

No local Democratic candidates received a presidential shout-out .\nMr. Obama \u2019 s low-key appearance at Ms. Paltrow \u2019 s home wasn \u2019 t the exception this year : He has headlined no public campaign events this election cycle , and since Labor Day he has appeared in person with only two candidates\u2014in the Democratic states of California and Illinois .
