Susana Martinez , there 's one thing in common about the mounting Trump controversies : The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is aiming to make the entire 2016 campaign about himself .\nAmerican politics is littered with larger-than-life personalities . But no presidential candidate in living memory has built a campaign so exclusively on the foundation of his own personal , brand , self-congratulatory rhetoric and life story as Trump . And do n't expect anything different if he makes it to the White House .\n`` You think I 'm going to change ? '' he told reporters at a press conference this week . `` I 'm not going to change . ''\nTrump has prospered by being the loudest , most unapologetic salesman of self in politics that most seasoned observers have ever seen . He is not just the figurehead of his own campaign -- his personality is the campaign , as evidenced by stump speeches , press conferences and endless television and radio interviews that add up to an unstoppable torrent of self-promotion .\n`` The Trump campaign is not about any cause , it is all about Trump , '' said Peter Wehner , who has watched candidates and presidents up close as an aide in the last three Republican administrations . `` His campaign is all about him . How he treats other people is all about him -- whether one is praised and patted on the head or cruelly mocked depends on what you have said about him .

He 's dispatched his rivals in a bloated Republican field and is now locked in a tight general election duel with Hillary Clinton . His style could even help him win over disaffected workers who also seem themselves as victimized by the political and economic establishment .\nStill , there are major questions about whether a personality-driven campaign -- lacking the traditional organizational and field skills -- can be successful during a complex national contest .\nThe Clinton campaign is working overtime to make Trump 's personal mythologizing look like a fatal flaw . The former secretary of state is mounting a two-pronged strategy that centers directly on Trump 's persona . She hopes to make a case that his volatile personality makes him unsuitable to be commander-in-chief and to use incidents from his colorful character and business career to deconstruct Trump 's carefully built self image .\n`` He is trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump University , '' Clinton said Wednesday , referring to the growing scrutiny surrounding Trump 's namesake training programs .\nClinton will keep up the attacks Thursday during a foreign policy speech in San Diego .
