Liberals \u2019 share of the Democratic electorate is 12 points greater than in the 2008 Democratic primary .\nHere \u2019 s one way those ideological divisions play out : Among Republican voters , two-thirds support temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country ; fewer , but still four in 10 , support deporting illegal immigrants .\nMeanwhile , among Democratic voters , two-thirds support a single-payer health care system . And four in 10 want the next president to follow policies that are \u201c more liberal \u201d than Obama \u2019 s .\nRepublicans are fuming , and worried \u2013 far more so than Democrats : Three-quarters of GOP voters are \u201c very \u201d worried about the economy \u2019 s direction \u2013 that compares with about a quarter of Democratic voters .\nSix in 10 Republican voters are \u201c very \u201d worried about a major terrorist attack \u2013 again vs. just a quarter voters in the Democratic contest .\nAbout half of GOP voters are looking for a political outsider vs. , again , about a quarter of Democratic voters .\nNine in 10 GOP voters are either dissatisfied or angry about the way the government is working . That includes four in 10 who are angry about it \u2013 vs. barely over one in 10 Democratic voters .\nHalf of Republican voters say they feel \u201c betrayed \u201d by their own party \u2013 an unbalanced question , but still . Among Democrats , far fewer feel \u201c betrayed , \u201d about one in seven .\nDemocrats are not focused on electability \u2013 in this case , neither are Republicans :\nAmong Democratic voters , barely more than one in 10 picks electability as the most important candidate attribute . A third , instead , pick honesty and trustworthiness . A quarter each select either a candidate who \u201c cares about people like me \u201d or has the right experience . \u201d\nAmong Republican voters , again , about one in 10 picks electability . Instead a third are looking mainly for a candidate who \u201c shares my values \u201d ; three in 10 for one who \u2019 ll \u201c bring needed change \u201d and two in 10 for a candidate who \u201c tells it like it is . \u201d\nMore than four in 10 Republican voters finally decided on their candidate just in the last few days .

Just about half would be satisfied with Trump as the nominee ; only about four in 10 would be satisfied with either Cruz or Rubio .\nIndependents are turning out in substantial numbers in both the Republican and Democratic primaries .\nMany voters in both contests expressed interest in a political outsider for their parties \u2019 nominees .\nPolitical independents account for about four in 10 primary voters in both the Republican and Democratic contests , according to preliminary exit poll results . That \u2019 s typical of the usually high turnout among independents in New Hampshire . They \u2019 re less prevalent in other state primaries .\nNearly half of Republicans say they \u2019 re looking for a candidate from \u201c outside the political establishment \u201d \u2013 sentiment that \u2019 s boosted Donald Trump in Iowa and in national polls alike .

Fewer Democrats are later deciders , about two in 10 .\nAs usual for New Hampshire , turnout by evangelicals is lower than in Iowa , where they were key to Ted Cruz \u2019 s first-place finish .
