    "title": "Levi Strauss CEO: Why Business Leaders Need to Take a Stand on Gun Violence",

    "authors": "Phil Wahba, Terry Collins, Aaron Pressman, Jaclyn Trop",
    "content": "In November 2016 , I wrote an open letter requesting that gun owners not bring firearms into our stores , offices , or facilities , even in states where it \u2019 s permitted by law . This was following an incident in one of our stores in which a customer accidentally shot and injured himself while trying on a pair of jeans . While that was bad , it could have been worse : The bullet could have killed him , another customer , or one of our employees .\nIn the days after I published that letter , I received threats to our stores , our business , and even on my life . It was unsettling . But these personal attacks pale in comparison to the threats that activists and survivors from Parkland , Sandy Hook , and daily incidents of gun violence face every time they speak up on this issue .\nAs president and CEO of a values-driven company that \u2019 s known the world over as a pioneer of the American West and one of the great symbols of American freedom , I take the responsibility of speaking up on the important issues of our day very seriously . We can \u2019 t take on every issue . But as business leaders with power in the public and political arenas , we simply can not stand by silently when it comes to the issues that threaten the very fabric of the communities where we live and work . While taking a stand can be unpopular with some , doing nothing is no longer an option .\nThat \u2019 s why Levi Strauss & Co. is stepping up our support for gun violence prevention . You may wonder why a company that doesn \u2019 t manufacture or sell guns is wading into this issue , but for us , it \u2019 s simple . Americans shouldn \u2019 t have to live in fear of gun violence . It \u2019 s an issue that affects all of us\u2014all generations and all walks of life .\nThe stakes could not be higher . On an average day , 96 Americans are killed by guns , and hundreds more are wounded . Most are suicides or unintentional shootings . Our nation \u2019 s gun homicide rate is more than 25 times the average rate of other high-income countries . Some shootings make the headlines ; some you never hear of ; but each one is a tragedy .\nSo today , on top of our previous actions , Levi Strauss & Co. is lending its support for gun violence prevention in three new areas .\nFirst , we have established the Safer Tomorrow Fund , which will direct more than $ 1 million in philanthropic grants from Levi Strauss & Co. over the next four years to fuel the work of nonprofits and youth activists who are working to end gun violence in America .\nSecond , I \u2019 m proud to announce that Levi Strauss & Co. is partnering with Everytown for Gun Safety and executives including Michael Bloomberg to form Everytown Business Leaders for Gun Safety , a coalition of business leaders who believe , as we do , that business has a critical role to play in and a moral obligation to do something about the gun violence epidemic in this country . I encourage every CEO and business leader reading this to consider the impact we could make if we stood together alongside the broad coalition of concerned parents , youth , elders , veterans , and community and faith leaders who are committed to shaping a safer path forward .\nThird , we know that some of our employees have been personally affected by this issue and want to see change . Therefore , we are doubling our usual employee donation match to organizations aligned with our Safer Tomorrow Fund . In addition , we \u2019 re encouraging employees who are concerned about gun violence to get involved . Levi Strauss & Co. provides employees five hours a month ( 60 hours a year ) in paid volunteer time and we recently expanded this to include political activism . We \u2019 re encouraging our employees to use their time to make an impact .\nI know that Americans , including many of our own consumers , employees , and other partners , hold a wide spectrum of views related to guns . I \u2019 m not here to suggest we repeal the Second Amendment or to suggest that gun owners aren \u2019 t responsible . In fact , as a former U.S. Army officer , I took a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States . But as retired four-star general Michael Hayden once said , \u201c There are some weapons out there that frankly nobody should have access to . And actually , there are some people out there who should never have access to any weapons . \u201d\nWe can \u2019 t insulate ourselves from every threat . We can \u2019 t \u201c harden \u201d every place we gather\u2014whether it be our schools , workplaces , shops , churches , or entertainment venues . But we can take common-sense , measurable steps\u2014like criminal background checks on all gun sales\u2014that will save lives .\nAfter the Parkland tragedy , support for stronger gun laws reached 68 % \u2014the highest level in 25 years . And support is being sustained by the powerful movement led by youth from Parkland , Chicago , Oakland , Baltimore , and other cities across the nation .\nAs a company , we have never been afraid to take an unpopular stand to support a greater good . We integrated our factories in the American South years before the Civil Rights Act was passed . We offered benefits to same-sex partners in the 1990s , long before most companies did . We pulled our financial support for the Boy Scouts of America when it banned gay troop leaders .\nWhile each one of these stands may have been controversial at the time , history proved the company right in the long run . And I \u2019 m convinced that while some will disagree with our stand to end gun violence , history will prove this position right too .\nOur country has faced seemingly intractable issues like this before , but together we \u2019 ve overcome them . We can do it again . Together we can put an end to the gun violence epidemic in America .\nChip Bergh is the president and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. and serves on the company \u2019 s board of directors .",
