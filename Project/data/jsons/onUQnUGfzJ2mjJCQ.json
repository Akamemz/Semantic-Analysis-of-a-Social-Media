MUST WATCH Neil Gorsuch takes Supreme Court oath 01:20\nAt his first State of the Union address in January , the President did more than praise Gorsuch . He said that his nominee 's conservative judicial philosophy would serve as a template for future nominees .\n`` We are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written , '' the President said . It was all that judicial conservatives - who seek to fill the benches with judges in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- could hope for . Like Scalia , Gorsuch believes the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original public meaning . In legalese , it 's called originalism , or textualism .\nBut Trump 's praise that night was met with a stony glare as the cameras panned to Gorsuch . The rookie justice -- however awkwardly -- wanted to send a message that he was now a part of a separate branch of government and was going to chart his own course . He only changed his demeanor when the liberal Justice Elena Kagan leaned over and whispered something in his ear .\nGorsuch 's critics say the new justice already tipped his hand , citing , for instance , the fact that he 'd cast a preliminary vote in favor of a version of Trump 's controversial travel ban .\n`` Notwithstanding the five second glare to the President , I do n't think there is anything in Justice Gorsuch 's actual record so far that would demonstrate judicial independence , '' said Christopher Kang , who served as deputy counsel to President Barack Obama .\nBut Carrie Severino , of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network , calls Gorsuch 's first year nothing short of `` outstanding '' and says she believes he will eventually expand Scalia 's legacy .\nIndeed , at oral arguments , Gorsuch 's questions suggest that he sees the law at times through a Scalian lens .\nOne of the biggest issues of the term , for example , concerns partisan gerrymandering . The justices appear deeply divided about whether they can or should come up with a standard to decide when politicians go too far in using political motives to draw congressional districts . In 2004 , Scalia said that courts should stay out .\nAt oral arguments in a case challenging Republican-drawn maps in Wisconsin , Gorsuch seemed to echo that sentiment .\n`` Maybe we can just for a second , talk about the arcane matter , the Constitution , '' Gorsuch said to a lawyer representing those challenging the Wisconsin maps . `` Where exactly do we get authority to revise state legislative lines ? ''\nProfessor Rick Hasen , of the University of California , Irvine School of Law , who has penned a new book on Scalia , says the exchange highlights Gorsuch 's fidelity to originalism .\n`` Like Scalia , '' Hasen said , Gorsuch believes `` other methodologies would unconstitutionally turn judges into legislators . ''\nIn another case , Gorsuch hinted that he might side with the liberals in a dispute concerning a provision of law that requires the mandatory removal of some immigrants who have committed crimes .\nBut even in agreeing with liberals , he could be in line with Scalia 's jurisprudence . Scalia did tend to side with the left side of the bench when it came to the vagueness of statutes used to convict criminal defendants .\nAnd there is some indication that Gorsuch has independent views when it comes to the 4th Amendment .\nIn November , several of the justices appeared skeptical of the Trump administration 's argument that it did n't need a warrant when it collected locational data from an individual 's cell phone over an extended period of time . But while his colleagues expressed privacy-based concerns , Gorsuch looked at the case from a different perspective and questioned whether the issue should be decided on trespass grounds .\nAlthough vocal at most oral arguments , sometimes Gorsuch leaves court watchers hanging .\nHis vote will be critical in a case concerning the future of public sector unions , but he did not ask a single question at arguments . The same was true for another hot button case about Ohio 's method for purging voters from its rolls .\nGorsuch 's thoughts on those issues may only be apparent at the end of June when all the rulings are in .\nAs the junior-most justice , Gorsuch is unlikely to be assigned any blockbuster majority opinions in the near future . But in one below-the-radar opinion issued in January , he wrote a dissent that featured sweeping language about federalism . Gorsuch admitted that the court was only interpreting a `` small statute '' but feared that the majority opinion was `` no small departure from our foundational principles of federalism . ''\nHe chided the majority for wandering `` so far from the idea of a federal government of limited and enumerated powers '' and ended the opinion with a flourish : `` What boundaries remain then ? ''\nAlthough the language in the opinion -- joined by Justices Clarence Thomas , Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito -- seemed loftier than the case at hand , it was as if Gorsuch was laying down a marker for the long game and a future when his dissents might be majority opinions .\nJUST WATCHED See the times Trump has praised Gorsuch Replay More Videos ...
