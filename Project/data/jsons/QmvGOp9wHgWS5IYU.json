    "content": "After two years of suspense , Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report was released into Washington \u2019 s partisan scrum Thursday showing investigators did not find evidence of collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 as Attorney General Bill Barr declared last month \u2013 but revealing an array of controversial actions by the president that were examined as part of the investigation \u2019 s obstruction inquiry .\nThis included President Trump allegedly telling his White House counsel in June 2017 to inform the acting attorney general that Mueller had conflicts of interest and `` must be removed . '' The report said Trump also fumed over the original appointment -- lamenting it would mean the `` end of my presidency '' -- first telling then-DOJ leader Jeff Sessions he should resign , and later trying to get Sessions to take back control of the probe .\nMueller ultimately did not reach a conclusion on whether the president 's conduct amounted to obstruction , stating : `` [ W ] hile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime , it also does not exonerate him . ''\nBut even though Barr 's DOJ determined they did not have evidence to pursue such a case , the details in the report only fueled Democrats ' mounting calls to not only see the unredacted report but have Mueller testify .\n`` This is exactly why we need to hear directly from Special Counsel Mueller and receive the full , unredacted report with the underlying evidence , '' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler tweeted , highlighting that section .\nTrump and his legal team , though , declared victory upon the release of the report .\nThe swift reactions indicated the release of the report is only likely to fuel , not quiet , the long-raging debate in Washington over the Russia probe and serve as fodder going into the 2020 election year .\nTRUMP DECLARES VICTORY AS MUELLER REPORT DROPS : 'NO COLLUSION , NO OBSTRUCTION '\nAs stated in Barr \u2019 s summary last month and reiterated again at a press conference earlier Thursday morning , though , the special counsel did not find clear evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia .\n\u201c [ T ] he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities , \u201d the report said , while also saying there were `` links '' between the two .\n\u201c While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign , the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges . Among other things , the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal , \u201d the special counsel report stated .\nThe version of the more than 400-page report that the Justice Department made public Thursday includes redactions , consistent with Barr \u2019 s plan to black out portions of the document\u2014including grand jury material , information the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods , any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of \u201c peripheral players . \u201d\nThe redactions in the report were color-coded , labeled with the reasoning behind each redaction , with categories including `` grand jury material , '' `` personal privacy , '' `` investigative technique ; '' and `` harm to ongoing matter . ''\nThe report , meanwhile , went in depth on the obstruction of justice question , despite the lack of a decision on that front . In Barr 's summary to Congress last month , he said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein found the evidence was \u201c not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense . \u201d\nThe report itself noted that they obtained evidence about the president \u2019 s \u201c actions and intent , \u201d and that presented \u201c difficult issues that would need to be resolved \u201d if they were making a traditional judgment .\nThe report looked at 10 episodes related to the allegations of obstruction of justice , including :\n\u201c The campaign 's response to reports about Russian support for Trump ; Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn ; The President 's reaction to the continuing Russia investigation ; The President 's termination of Comey ; The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him ; Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel 's investigation ; Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence ; Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation ; and Conduct toward Flynn , Manafort , [ REDACTED ] ; conduct involving Michael Cohen . \u201d\nThe report revealed that the president reacted to the news a special counsel had been appointed by telling his advisers that it was \u201c the end of my presidency . I 'm f -- -ed , \u201d and demanding that Sessions resign . Once Sessions submitted his resignation , the president did not accept it .\nThe report also detailed Trump 's alleged effort to have Mueller sidelined , amid reports at the time that the special counsel \u2019 s office was investigating the president for obstruction of justice . The report detailed a dramatic moment where the president 's White House counsel apparently rejected the push .\n\u201c On June 17 , 2017 , the president called [ White House Counsel Don ] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed . McGahn did not carry out the direction , however , deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre , \u201d the report stated , referencing the Watergate scandal .\nThe report also revealed that when the media reported of the president \u2019 s request for McGahn to have Mueller removed , the president directed White House officials \u201c to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed . \u201d\n\u201c McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered happening , \u201d the report said .\nThe report went on to explain that two days after the initial request to McGahn , the president made another attempt to \u201c affect the course of the Russia investigation . \u201d\nBARR AFFIRMS MUELLER PROBE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA-TRUMP COLLUSION\n\u201c On June 19 , 2017 , the president met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , a trusted advisor outside the government , and dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions , \u201d the report said .\n\u201c The message said that Sessions should publicly announce that , notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation , the investigation was \u2018 very unfair \u2019 to the president , the president had done nothing wrong , and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and \u2018 let [ him ] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections . \u2019 \u201d\nLewandowski , according to the report , said he understood what the president wanted Sessions to do .\n\u201c Lewandowski did not want to deliver the president \u2019 s message personally , \u201d the report said , \u201c so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions . \u201d\nThe report also said \u201c substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst \u201d for the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey was his \u201c unwillingness to publicly state that the president was not personally under investigation. \u201d But the report said the evidence \u201c does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia . \u201d\nThe report stated that while the areas the special counsel investigated \u201c involved discrete acts , the overall pattern of the President \u2019 s conduct towards the investigations \u201d shed light on the \u201c nature \u201d of his acts . The special counsel determined that the actions investigated are divided into \u201c two phases , \u201d which they said reflected \u201c a possible shift in the President \u2019 s motives . \u201d\nTRUMP THOUGHT PRESIDENCY WAS OVER WHEN TOLD OF MUELLER 'S APPOINTMENT : 'THIS IS THE END ... I 'M F -- -ED '\nThe first phase was related to the firing of Comey . \u201c During that time , the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally under investigation . Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel , however , the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry , \u201d the report said , adding that \u201c at that point , the president engaged in a second phase of conduct , involving public attacks on the investigation , non-public efforts to control it , and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation . \u201d\nThe evidence detailed in the report related to allegations of obstruction of justice , though , is likely to come under intense scrutiny from congressional Democrats and could be used in their sweeping Trump-related investigations .\nThe president \u2019 s legal team , in anticipation of obstruction of justice details in the report , has prepared their own report to counter the allegations .\n\u201c They assumed all along that there was going to be a finding of no collusion , so the rebuttal is about obstruction , \u201d a source close to Trump \u2019 s legal team told Fox News . \u201c They are preparing a rebuttal to presumed allegations which will be refuted . \u201d\nThe special counsel wrote that they sought a voluntary interview with the president , but after more than a year of discussing the prospect of one , the president declined .
