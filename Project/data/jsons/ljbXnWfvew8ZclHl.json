    "content": "Before we wade into the policy implications of yesterday 's immigration gathering , kudos to the White House for making the savvy decision to allow extraordinary media access to that bipartisan meeting . Many political observers have commented on the rarity of watching legislative `` sausage-making '' playing out in real time , so there was definitely a certain novelty to the spectacle -- but letting cameras roll as members of both parties discussed an important issue very much felt like a civic service , too . Regardless , it was a political masterstroke by the Trump administration : The president looked comfortably in command of the room , if not all of the facts , and appeared genuine in his desire to strike a deal that proves at least somewhat satisfactory to the various factions at the bargaining table . Americans were able to watch goal-oriented presidential leadership in action , basically on live television . It also served as a much , much , much more effective rebuttal to deeply unflattering claims about presidential fitness in Michael Wolff 's book than desperate-looking tweets . Here is a telling reaction to the scene from a frequent Trump critic :\nWatching Trump in the bi-partisan DACA meeting . I think my history is clear - I 'm pretty far from a Trumper .

The White House insists this $ 18 billion is only phase one of the great work that Trump promised would cover the border between Mexico and the United States . This first tranche would be dedicated , however , primarily to reinforcing the 400 miles of existing barriers while constructing another 316 miles of new fencing . In addition , the administration wants another $ 5 billion for new technology to police the border , $ 8 billion for additional personnel and training , and $ 1 billion for new access roads . If Republicans appropriated even half of this funding , it would be a massive investment in border security , many times the $ 1.6 billion Congress sought for augmented border barriers in 2006 .
