Richard Nixon quit rather than face impeachment for Watergate . Even Ronald Reagan , whose second term included the beginnings of his cherished collapse of the Soviet Union , was damaged by the Iran-Contra scandal .\nMr. Obama is starting out on the wrong foot by feuding with Congress over the nation \u2019 s borrowing limit and gun control , said Al Zacher , author of the book \u201c Presidential Power in Troubled Second Terms. \u201d He said the rare successful second terms have involved presidents who forged good relationships with strong congressional leaders , such as Mr. Reagan with Speaker Thomas P. \u201c Tip \u201d O \u2019 Neill Jr. and President Eisenhower with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson .\n\u201c Getting along with Congress is the issue , and it was for the majority of those presidents who either succeeded or failed , \u201d Mr. Zacher said . \u201c The odds aren \u2019 t there for Obama . \u201d\nEvening those odds may be why a key Obama surrogate blitzed the airwaves Sunday to talk about a more productive second-term relationship between the White House and Congress .\nSenior adviser David Plouffe , who made the rounds of several talk shows , told CBS \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation \u201d that the president would do \u201c a better job \u201d working with lawmakers this term . \u201c On the issues the president intends to really push and focus on , there \u2019 s massive support in the country , even amongst Republicans . \u201d\nA week after his re-election , Mr. Obama said he understood the lesson about presidents trying to do too much in their final four years .\n\u201c I \u2019 m more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\n\u201c We are very cautious about that . On the other hand , I didn \u2019 t get re-elected just to bask in re-election .
