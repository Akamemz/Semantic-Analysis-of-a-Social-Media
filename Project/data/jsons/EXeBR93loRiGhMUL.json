The results from its 2015 assessments are in, and they are not encouraging.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting performance measure reported by NAEP is the percentage of students who have \u201cpassed\u201d the criteria for grade-level performance. Looking at the national testing done on eighth grade students in the subjects of mathematics and reading, we can identify three eras of student performance:\n\n\u2022 19701990 brought stagnation in NAEP math and reading proficiencies. Somewhat less than 30 percent of students were proficient in reading, and approximately 20 percent were proficient in mathematics. Performance levels did not improve over these two decades.\n\n\u2022 19902013 was a period of modest but significant performance improvements, particularly in mathematics. It was also the period of the school choice reform movement and implementation. During those years we saw the introduction of school vouchers and public charter schools. By the end of this interval, NAEP testing revealed both mathematics and reading proficiencies had risen to about 35 percent. That trend has now abruptly stopped and reversed.\n\n\u2022 20132015 is admittedly a short period, but NAEP proficiencies in both of these subjects have now dropped. Math proficiencies went from 35 percent to 33 percent, and reading proficiencies slid from 35 percent to 34 percent. This period of study coincides with the rollout of Common Core academic standards and their accompanying testing programs in many states.\n\nThe recent declines are not just statistical fluctuations, as we know from a statistical error analysis I and my colleagues at Asora Education Enterprises performed.\n\nThe skeptic might say, \u201cWell, correlation does not prove much. You shouldn\u2019t be so quick to blame Common Core.\u201d That\u2019s correct. We need more evidence if we are to confirm our suspicions.\n\nSo we looked at the NAEP results state by state. We grouped states according to their participation in Common Core. Did they formally adopt the standards without rescinding them? Did they participate in one or the other official Common Core testing consortia? After grouping the 50 states and District of Columbia accordingly, we found this:\n\n\u2022 Every grouping showed a drop in proficiencies.\n\n\u2022 In math, these declines were 0.5 percent worse for the Common Core states.\n\n\u2022 In reading, these declines were 1.0 percent worse for Common Core states.\n\nHow can we explain these results?\n\nFirst, we must acknowledge these numbers are of the same order as the published statistical error rates involved. This means we do not yet have firm statistical proof of what we are about to say. However, we do have indications of an effect.\n\nWe see two correlations between Common Core and the witnessed degradation in performance: direct and indirect, a double whammy.\n\n\u2022 The direct effect of Common Core is attributed to actual changes in instructional practices within those states implementing some or all of the Common Core standards.\n\n\u2022 The indirect effect of Common Core is an informal one within nonparticipating states wherein some changes have been made \u201ctoward\u201d Common Core without actual formal involvement.\n\nWhat, then, can parents and other stakeholders of K12 education conclude from this?\n\nWhat\u2019s clearest is that Common Core has not brought any improvements in the important subjects of mathematics and reading. In fact, the presence of this unfortunate \u201cexperiment\u201d correlates with performance degradation in both subjects.\n\nLess clear, but likely, is the fact that states which have formally participated in Common Core have fared worse than those not doing so.
