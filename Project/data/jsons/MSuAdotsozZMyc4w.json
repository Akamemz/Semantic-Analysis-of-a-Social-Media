Eight Textbooks . Two American Stories . American history textbooks can differ across the country , in ways that are shaded by partisan politics .\nWe analyzed some of the most popular social studies textbooks used in California and Texas . Here \u2019 s how political divides shape what students learn about the nation \u2019 s history .\nThe textbooks cover the same sweeping story , from the brutality of slavery to the struggle for civil rights . The self-evident truths of the founding documents to the waves of immigration that reshaped the nation .\nThe books have the same publisher . They credit the same authors . But they are customized for students in different states , and their contents sometimes diverge in ways that reflect the nation \u2019 s deepest partisan divides .\nHundreds of differences \u2014 some subtle , others extensive \u2014 emerged in a New York Times analysis of eight commonly used American history textbooks in California and Texas , two of the nation \u2019 s largest markets .\nIn a country that can not come to a consensus on fundamental questions \u2014 how restricted capitalism should be , whether immigrants are a burden or a boon , to what extent the legacy of slavery continues to shape American life \u2014 textbook publishers are caught in the middle . On these questions and others , classroom materials are not only shaded by politics , but are also helping to shape a generation of future voters .\nConservatives have fought for schools to promote patriotism , highlight the influence of Christianity and celebrate the founding fathers . In a September speech , President Trump warned against a \u201c radical left \u201d that wants to \u201c erase American history , crush religious liberty , indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology . \u201d\nThe left has pushed for students to encounter history more from the ground up than from the top down , with a focus on the experiences of marginalized groups such as enslaved people , women and Native Americans .\nThe books The Times analyzed were published in 2016 or later and have been widely adopted for eighth and 11th graders , though publishers declined to share sales figures . Each text has editions for Texas and California , among other states , customized to satisfy policymakers with different priorities .\n\u201c At the end of the day , it \u2019 s a political process , \u201d said Jes\u00fas F. de la Teja , an emeritus professor of history at Texas State University who has worked for the state of Texas and for publishers in reviewing standards and textbooks .\n[ Thousands of readers have responded to this article . Here is what they had to say . ]\nThe differences between state editions can be traced back to several sources : state social studies standards ; state laws ; and feedback from panels of appointees that huddle , in Sacramento and Austin hotel conference rooms , to review drafts .\nRequests from textbook review panels , submitted in painstaking detail to publishers , show the sometimes granular ways that ideology can influence the writing of history .\nA California panel asked the publisher McGraw-Hill to avoid the use of the word \u201c massacre \u201d when describing 19th-century Native American attacks on white people . A Texas panel asked Pearson to point out the number of clergy who signed the Declaration of Independence , and to state that the nation \u2019 s founders were inspired by the Protestant Great Awakening .\nAll the members of the California panel were educators selected by the State Board of Education , whose members were appointed by former Gov . Jerry Brown , a Democrat . The Texas panel , appointed by the Republican-dominated State Board of Education , was made up of educators , parents , business representatives and a Christian pastor and politician .\n[ In California Today : Dana Goldstein talks about why she picked California and Texas . Read the newsletter here . ]\nMcGraw-Hill , the publisher whose annotated Bill of Rights appears differently in the two states , said it had created the additional wording on the Second Amendment and gun control for the California textbook . A national version of the pages is similar to the Texas edition , which does not call attention to gun rights , the company said in a written statement .\nPearson , the publisher whose Texas textbook raises questions about the quality of Harlem Renaissance literature , said such language \u201c adds more depth and nuance . \u201d\nCritical language about nonwhite cultural movements also appears in a Texas book from McGraw-Hill . It is partly a result of debates , in 2010 , between conservative and liberal members of the Texas Board of Education over whether state standards should mention cultural movements like hip-hop and country music . Their compromise was to ask teachers and textbook publishers to address \u201c both the positive and negative impacts \u201d of artistic movements .\nTexas struck that requirement in 2018 , but its most recent textbooks , published in 2016 , will reflect it for years to come .\nPublishers are eager to please state policymakers of both parties , during a challenging time for the business . Schools are transitioning to digital materials . And with the ease of internet research , many teachers say they prefer to curate their own primary-source materials online .\nHow Textbooks are Produced 1 Authors , often academics , write a national version of each text . 2 Publishers customize the books for states and large districts to meet local standards , often without input from the original authors . 3 State or district textbook reviewers go over each book and ask publishers for further changes . 4 Publishers revise their books and sell them to districts and schools .\nStill , recent textbooks have come a long way from what was published in past decades . Both Texas and California volumes deal more bluntly with the cruelty of the slave trade , eschewing several myths that were common in textbooks for generations : that some slave owners treated enslaved people kindly and that African-Americans were better off enslaved than free . The books also devote more space to the women \u2019 s movement and balance the narrative of European immigration with stories of Latino and Asian immigrants .\n\u201c American history is not anymore the story of great white men , \u201d said Albert S. Broussard , a history professor at Texas A & M University and an author of both the Texas and California editions of McGraw-Hill \u2019 s textbooks .\nHere is how the politics of American history play out in California and Texas textbooks , on subjects like race , immigration , gender , sexuality and the economy .\nWhite resistance to black progress is covered differently in the two states .

Texas \u2019 social studies guidelines do not mention housing discrimination at all .\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway Texas says that white Southerners opposed Reconstruction because of tax increases as well as racial resentment . California instead includes primary-source quotations from black historical figures about white resistance to civil rights . McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History & Geography : Growth & Conflict , \u201d California , P. 586 ; McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History to 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 555 Both states say that breaches of \u201c racial etiquette \u201d led to lynchings after Reconstruction . But only California , whose edition was written more recently , makes clear that the perpetrators of lynchings also hoped to discourage black political and economic power .

McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History & Geography : Growth & Conflict , \u201d California , P. 624 California states that the federal government failed to recognize nonbinary gender identities and female leaders in its early relations with Native Americans . McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History Since 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 111 Texas does not mention gender roles or gender identity in its discussion of efforts to \u201c Americanize \u201d Native Americans .\nIn Texas textbooks , mentions of L.G.B.T.Q . issues tend to be restricted to coverage of events in recent decades , such as the Stonewall uprising , the AIDS crisis and debates over marriage rights .\nBut for recent California editions , publishers wrote thousands of words of new text in response to the FAIR Education Act , a law signed by Governor Brown in 2011 . It requires schools to teach the contributions of lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and disabled Americans .\nPeppered throughout California books are passages on topics like same-sex families under slavery and early sex reassignment surgery in the 1950s \u2014 text that does not appear in Texas versions .\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway California states that enslaved women faced sexual violence from owners and overseers . McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History & Geography : Growth & Conflict , \u201d California , P. 449 ; McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History to 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 443 California mentions the \u201c lavender scare \u201d that targeted thousands of gay men and lesbians . Pearson , \u201c United States History : The Twentieth Century , \u201d California , P. 486 ; Pearson , \u201c United States History : 1877 to Present , '' Texas , P. 456 .

Both states focus on women \u2019 s fight against discrimination in the workplace . Only California says birth control played a role , by \u201c allowing women to exert greater control over their sexuality and family planning. \u201d McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History & Geography : Continuity and Change , \u201d California , P. 627 ; McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History Since 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 525 .\nStephanie Kugler , an eighth-grade history teacher in West Sacramento , Calif. , said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom \u2019 s textbook , about women who dressed as men to fight in the Civil War and continued to live as men , into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender . The students read accounts of those soldiers \u2019 lives alongside more traditional sources , such as letters written by a black Union soldier and a Confederate soldier .\nHer goal , Ms. Kugler said , was to \u201c make it really authentic \u201d to talk about diversity in the context of each historical period .\nWhile both states devote many pages to the women \u2019 s movement , Texas books , in general , avoid discussions of sex or sexuality .\nImmigration and nativism are major themes in American history textbooks . McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History & Geography : Continuity and Change , \u201d California , P. 736 California includes an excerpt from a novel about a Dominican-American family . McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History Since 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 609 In the same place , Texas highlights the voice of a Border Patrol agent .\nMichael Teague , a Border Patrol agent , is featured in the Texas edition of McGraw-Hill \u2019 s 11th grade textbook . He discusses his concerns about drug trafficking and says , \u201c if you open the border wide up , you \u2019 re going to invite political and social upheaval . \u201d\nMr. Teague \u2019 s story is featured at the end of a chapter on recent immigration , alongside accounts from a Vietnamese immigrant and a second-generation Mexican-American .\nThat section in the California edition of the same book is devoted to a long excerpt from the novel \u201c How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents , \u201d by Julia Alvarez . It deals with intergenerational tensions in a Dominican-American family .\nIn a written statement , McGraw-Hill said the full-page Border Patrol narrative was not included in the California edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt . And at the time the Texas edition was produced , six years ago , state standards called for students to analyze both \u201c legal and illegal immigration to the United States . \u201d\nIn contrast , California textbooks are more likely to note when a historical figure was an immigrant . And they include more detail on the role immigrants such as Japanese and Filipino farmworkers played in labor movements .\nCalifornia is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups , including Asian-Americans , Pacific Islanders , European-Americans and Mexican-Americans .\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway Only California states that Levi Strauss was a German Jewish immigrant . McGraw-Hill , \u201c United States History & Geography : Growth & Conflict , \u201d California , P. 416 ; McGraw-Hill , `` United States History Since 1877 , '' Texas , P. 417 California tells the story of Wong Kim Ark , whose 1898 Supreme Court case established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants ; Texas \u2019 s edition , which is older , does not mention this case , but does cover the Chinese Exclusion Act . HMH , \u201c American History : Reconstruction to the Present , \u201d California , P. 247 ; HMH , \u201c The Americans : United States History Since 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 289\nThese additions are part of the reason California books are almost always longer than their Texas counterparts .\nCalifornia \u2019 s Board of Education adopted an expansive 842-page social studies framework in 2016 . Two years later , Texas \u2019 school board streamlined its social studies standards , which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages .\nCritics of California \u2019 s approach say that making state standards and textbooks longer and more inclusive can be overwhelming to teachers trying to move quickly through hundreds of years of material .\nBoth states emphasize the role of big business from the Gilded Age to the present . HMH , \u201c American History : Reconstruction to the Present , \u201d California , P. 160 California is critical of wealth inequality and the impact of companies like Standard Oil on the environment . HMH , \u201c The Americans : United States History Since 1877 , \u201d Texas , P. 235 Texas is more likely to celebrate free enterprise and entrepreneurs like Andrew Carnegie .\nTexas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the American economy ; since 1995 , state law has required that high school economics courses offer an \u201c emphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits. \u201d That emphasis seems to have made its way into the history curriculum as well .\nCalifornia \u2019 s curriculum materials , by contrast , sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally . \u201c The yawning gap between the haves and have-nots and what is to be done about it is one of the great questions of this time , \u201d says the state \u2019 s 2016 social studies framework .\nAs a result , California textbooks are more likely to celebrate unionism , critique the concentration of wealth and focus on how industry pollutes the environment .\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway California refers to \u201c the income gap \u201d and explains that \u201c changes in tax structures and safety-net programs \u201d and \u201c higher costs for education , child care , and housing \u201d played a role . Both state editions discuss economic inequality in reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement and the decline of labor unions . Pearson , \u201c United States History : The Twentieth Century , \u201d California , P. 728 ; Pearson , \u201c United States History : 1877 to Present , \u201d Texas , P. 687 . The older Texas edition highlights additional Republican critiques of President Barack Obama \u2019 s environmental policies , while the California book discusses the threat of rising sea levels . Pearson , \u201c United States History : The Twentieth Century , \u201d California , P. 749 ; Pearson , \u201c United States History : 1877 to Present , \u201d Texas , P. 709 .\nBoth the California and Texas 11th-grade textbooks from Pearson state , \u201c The main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation \u2019 s industries . \u201d\nThe Texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry : \u201c Republicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers \u2019 money , for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. \u201d The Solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011 , when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans .\nThe Texas book also states that American action on global warming may not make a difference if China , India , Russia and Brazil do not also act .\nThe California edition does not mention Solyndra or the other nations . However , it does include a section on the threat to American states and cities from rising sea levels , noting that the impact on tourism in Florida could hurt that state \u2019 s economy , and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened .\nPearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the California book was published several years later , and that concerns over coastal flooding have become \u201c more heightened in recent years . \u201d",

Only California says birth control played a role, by \u201callowing women to exert greater control over their sexuality and family planning.\u201d McGraw-Hill, \u201cUnited States History & Geography: Continuity and Change,\u201d California, P. 627; McGraw-Hill, \u201cUnited States History Since 1877,\u201d Texas, P. 525.\n\nStephanie Kugler, an eighth-grade history teacher in West Sacramento, Calif., said she had expanded an idea mentioned briefly in her classroom\u2019s textbook, about women who dressed as men to fight in the Civil War and continued to live as men, into an entire lesson on troops who today would be considered transgender. The students read accounts of those soldiers\u2019 lives alongside more traditional sources, such as letters written by a black Union soldier and a Confederate soldier.\n\nHer goal, Ms. Kugler said, was to \u201cmake it really authentic\u201d to talk about diversity in the context of each historical period.\n\nWhile both states devote many pages to the women\u2019s movement, Texas books, in general, avoid discussions of sex or sexuality.\n\nImmigration and nativism are major themes in American history textbooks. McGraw-Hill, \u201cUnited States History & Geography: Continuity and Change,\u201d California, P. 736 California includes an excerpt from a novel about a Dominican-American family. McGraw-Hill, \u201cUnited States History Since 1877,\u201d Texas, P. 609 In the same place, Texas highlights the voice of a Border Patrol agent.\n\nMichael Teague, a Border Patrol agent, is featured in the Texas edition of McGraw-Hill\u2019s 11th grade textbook. He discusses his concerns about drug trafficking and says, \u201cif you open the border wide up, you\u2019re going to invite political and social upheaval.\u201d\n\nMr. Teague\u2019s story is featured at the end of a chapter on recent immigration, alongside accounts from a Vietnamese immigrant and a second-generation Mexican-American.\n\nThat section in the California edition of the same book is devoted to a long excerpt from the novel \u201cHow the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents,\u201d by Julia Alvarez. It deals with intergenerational tensions in a Dominican-American family.\n\nIn a written statement, McGraw-Hill said the full-page Border Patrol narrative was not included in the California edition because it would not fit beside the literary excerpt. And at the time the Texas edition was produced, six years ago, state standards called for students to analyze both \u201clegal and illegal immigration to the United States.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, California textbooks are more likely to note when a historical figure was an immigrant. And they include more detail on the role immigrants such as Japanese and Filipino farmworkers played in labor movements.\n\nCalifornia is one of many states to ask teachers and textbooks in recent years to cover the contributions of specific immigrant groups, including Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, European-Americans and Mexican-Americans.\n\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway Only California states that Levi Strauss was a German Jewish immigrant. McGraw-Hill, \u201cUnited States History & Geography: Growth & Conflict,\u201d California, P. 416; McGraw-Hill, \"United States History Since 1877,\" Texas, P. 417 California tells the story of Wong Kim Ark, whose 1898 Supreme Court case established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants; Texas\u2019s edition, which is older, does not mention this case, but does cover the Chinese Exclusion Act. HMH, \u201cAmerican History: Reconstruction to the Present,\u201d California, P. 247; HMH, \u201cThe Americans: United States History Since 1877,\u201d Texas, P. 289\n\nThese additions are part of the reason California books are almost always longer than their Texas counterparts.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Board of Education adopted an expansive 842-page social studies framework in 2016. Two years later, Texas\u2019 school board streamlined its social studies standards, which are now laid out in 78 tightly compressed pages.\n\nCritics of California\u2019s approach say that making state standards and textbooks longer and more inclusive can be overwhelming to teachers trying to move quickly through hundreds of years of material.\n\nBoth states emphasize the role of big business from the Gilded Age to the present. HMH, \u201cAmerican History: Reconstruction to the Present,\u201d California, P. 160 California is critical of wealth inequality and the impact of companies like Standard Oil on the environment. HMH, \u201cThe Americans: United States History Since 1877,\u201d Texas, P. 235 Texas is more likely to celebrate free enterprise and entrepreneurs like Andrew Carnegie.\n\nTexas policymakers feel strongly about giving students a positive view of the American economy; since 1995, state law has required that high school economics courses offer an \u201cemphasis on the free enterprise system and its benefits.\u201d That emphasis seems to have made its way into the history curriculum as well.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s curriculum materials, by contrast, sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally. \u201cThe yawning gap between the haves and have-nots and what is to be done about it is one of the great questions of this time,\u201d says the state\u2019s 2016 social studies framework.\n\nAs a result, California textbooks are more likely to celebrate unionism, critique the concentration of wealth and focus on how industry pollutes the environment.\n\nCalifornia Texas Takeaway California refers to \u201cthe income gap\u201d and explains that \u201cchanges in tax structures and safety-net programs\u201d and \u201chigher costs for education, child care, and housing\u201d played a role. Both state editions discuss economic inequality in reference to the Occupy Wall Street movement and the decline of labor unions. Pearson, \u201cUnited States History: The Twentieth Century,\u201d California, P. 728; Pearson, \u201cUnited States History: 1877 to Present,\u201d Texas, P. 687. The older Texas edition highlights additional Republican critiques of President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental policies, while the California book discusses the threat of rising sea levels. Pearson, \u201cUnited States History: The Twentieth Century,\u201d California, P. 749; Pearson, \u201cUnited States History: 1877 to Present,\u201d Texas, P. 709.\n\nBoth the California and Texas 11th-grade textbooks from Pearson state, \u201cThe main argument against environmental legislation is that it hurts the economy and the nation\u2019s industries.\u201d\n\nThe Texas edition goes further to highlight criticism of federal efforts to subsidize the green energy industry: \u201cRepublicans accuse the government of wasting taxpayers\u2019 money, for example by supporting the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra.\u201d The Solyndra controversy was a fixation for conservatives in 2011, when the company went bankrupt after accepting half a billion dollars in federally guaranteed loans.\n\nThe Texas book also states that American action on global warming may not make a difference if China, India, Russia and Brazil do not also act.\n\nThe California edition does not mention Solyndra or the other nations. However, it does include a section on the threat to American states and cities from rising sea levels, noting that the impact on tourism in Florida could hurt that state\u2019s economy, and that transportation networks and buildings could be threatened.\n\nPearson said in a written statement that the differences between the books could be attributed mostly to the fact that the California book was published several years later, and that concerns over coastal flooding have become \u201cmore heightened in recent years.\u201d",
