Copy may not be in its final form .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Hillary Clinton has announced former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar as the head of her transition team . Salazar is a former United States senator from Colorado who now works at WilmerHale , one of the most influential lobbying firms in Washington . Some groups have criticized Salazar \u2019 s election , due\u2014or , his selection , due to his vocal support of fracking , the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone XL pipeline . Molly Dorozenski of Greenpeace USA said , \u201c If Clinton plans to effectively tackle climate change , the last thing her team needs is an industry insider like Ken Salazar . Salazar \u2019 s track record illustrates time and again that he is on the side of big industry , and not of the people . His most recent opposition to the anti-fracking initiatives in his home state of Colorado directly undermines Clinton \u2019 s alleged support of local control over fracking . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : In addition to Ken Salazar , other leaders of the transition team include former Obama National Security Adviser Tom Donilon , Center for American Progress head Neera Tanden , former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams , the director of Harvard \u2019 s Institute of Politics .\nFor more , we \u2019 re joined by David Sirota , senior editor for investigations at the International Business Times , joining us from Denver Open Media in Denver , Colorado , the home state of Ken Salazar .\nWelcome to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! , David . Well , start off by talking about this selection of the former interior secretary , former Colorado Senator Ken Salazar , to head the transition team of Hillary Clinton .\nDAVID SIROTA : The Clinton campaign announced this in the last 36 hours . Ken Salazar will head the team that would , if Hillary Clinton is elected , would help build the administration . It \u2019 s an important appointment because many people believe that personnel is policy , and the people who are going to run the transition team are going to be looking at thousands , potentially , of appointments across the federal government in a prospective Hillary Clinton administration . So , who is at the top of this transition team , what their beliefs are , what their politics have been , is very important to understanding what may be coming in a Clinton administration policywise and whether those policies in a Clinton administration will reflect the policy promises from Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Well , as we mentioned , for years , Ken Salazar has been a vocal proponent of fracking . In 2014 , he said , quote , \u201c We know that , from everything we \u2019 ve seen , there \u2019 s not a single case where hydraulic fracking has created an environmental problem for anyone . We need to make sure that story is told. \u201d And this is Ken Salazar speaking about fracking in 2011 , when he was still interior secretary .\nINTERIOR SECRETARY KEN SALAZAR : I think hydraulic fracking is very much a necessary part of the future of natural gas , because without this new technology , the amount of natural gas that we have available here in the country is a very diminished amount . And I think hydraulic fracking can be done in a safe way , in an environmentally responsible way and in a way that doesn \u2019 t create all of the concerns that it \u2019 s creating across the country right now .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Dave Sirota , what about this , his position on fracking ?\nDAVID SIROTA : Well , I mean , you \u2019 ve heard it there . I mean , Ken Salazar comes from Colorado and a part of the Colorado political establishment that supports fracking in a very aggressive way . The business community here supports the\u2014supports fracking in a very aggressive way . We \u2019 ve had fights at the local level , where cities and towns have voted to ban or restrict fracking , and the state government has tried to use its power to effectively disenfranchise those communities from using that power to block or restrict fracking . There \u2019 s now a ballot measure on the ballot to further restrict fracking . Ken Salazar has come out against that , been one of the icons in the political establishment against that . So , he is somebody who is very close to the oil and gas industry , and somebody who has been a big defender of fracking , in the face of evidence that there are reasons to be concerned about the environmental and public health effects of that process .\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about who WilmerHale , the most influential\u2014one of the most influential lobbying firms in Washington , who Ken Salazar works for , who else they represent ?\nDAVID SIROTA : Yeah , they represent corporate clients across the board\u2014Cigna , for instance . Cigna is a healthcare giant that is fighting for a merger with Anthem . WilmerHale represents them , Delta Airlines , Verizon , investment firms , a mining company . So , WilmerHale is a major law and lobbying firm . Ken Salazar is not a registered lobbyist at WilmerHale ; he is a partner there . Interestingly enough , Hillary Clinton had published a year ago an op-ed deriding the revolving door where lawmakers leave office and become lobbyists or help special interests . And she had specifically said that she was concerned about lawmakers who go into that line of work , public policy work , for corporate clients , but do not register as a lobbyist , which seems to fit the description of Ken Salazar .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : And also , the other appointees seem to be largely either former Obama officials or close confidants of Hillary Clinton , on the top transition team . Your sense of this sort of lack of an open tent , in terms of creating a transition team that would win support of other Americans ?\nDAVID SIROTA : Well , look , Hillary Clinton campaigned as a progressive , increasingly so facing the primary challenge from Bernie Sanders , and so I think there was some hope by folks that her transition team and her administration will reflect something that \u2019 s a little bit different from what people have come to believe is Clintonism , and more progressive perhaps than the Obama administration . This transition team seems to suggest more of continuity with the establishment , that the people who primarily are leading this are people who come out of the Obama administration , come out of the wing of the Democratic Party that is close to the business community , that is generally understood to be the establishment . So , we haven \u2019 t seen the policy yet , but if personnel is policy , this looks like a signal to the establishment that this is a continuity kind of government that \u2019 s going to be put out there\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you\u2014last November , Ken Salazar , along with another former interior secretary , Bruce Babbitt , co-wrote a piece in USA Today backing the TPP . They wrote , quote , \u201c The TPP is a strong trade deal that will level the playing field for workers to help middle-class families get ahead . It is also the greenest trade deal ever. \u201d Those are the words of , well , Ken Salazar , the new transition team head for Hillary Clinton .\nDAVID SIROTA : Yeah , I mean , that \u2019 s a very important op-ed for people to understand right now , especially when there are fears that Hillary Clinton will ultimately back a version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership if she becomes president . She has said she is against it , but prior to running for president , she had been helping the Obama administration push that trade deal . And so , her transition chief is somebody who has been very publicly out there , since leaving government , pushing that deal on environmental grounds . Of course , in that deal , there are provisions that may make it easier for America to export fracked gas across the globe , so that this , I think , complicates the questions of where Hillary Clinton and her administration may be on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nAMY GOODMAN : In 2014 , Ken Salazar also pushed for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , telling the Associated Press he believed construction could , quote , \u201c be done in a way that creates a win-win for energy and the environment. \u201d David Sirota ?\nDAVID SIROTA : Yeah , I mean , again , what we see from Ken Salazar \u2019 s record is somebody who is very close to big energy interests in\u2014that have business before the federal government . What does it mean for the future , when another pipeline proposal , for instance , comes down the pike ? We don \u2019 t know . But what we do know is that he will have a very serious hand in helping staff the Clinton administration , that he will have a hand in helping put personnel into the administration across the federal government . Whether he has litmus tests , whether he brings in people who he \u2019 s close to from his own politics , that will be a question . It will be a big question for Hillary Clinton .\nAMY GOODMAN : David , you have written a lot about the Clinton Foundation . Now , a lot of the news this week centers around the emails of Hillary Clinton . The State Department has agreed to provide the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch with emails that had been uncovered following the FBI \u2019 s probe into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s use of the private email server from 2009 to 2013 , her tenure as secretary of state . And we know some of these emails relate to the Clinton Foundation . Can you talk about the significance of this ?\nDAVID SIROTA : Well , look , I mean , I think that the connections between\u2014the potential connections between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation , they have been relatively well documented in the lead-up to this question about specific emails . Look , we know that money from foreign governments was going into the Clinton Foundation at a time that Hillary Clinton was America \u2019 s top diplomat\u2014for instance , at a time when Hillary Clinton \u2019 s State Department was approving weapons deals for many of those foreign governments . We know that companies were paying Bill Clinton speaking fees at the same time that they were lobbying the State Department . We know that other interests , other corporate interests , were giving to the foundation when they had business with and/or were lobbying the State Department . The emails will provide , potentially , a more granular detailing of potential connections between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation . And the fact of the matter is , the Clinton campaign has argued that there was no quid pro quo . Will there be a smoking-gun email ? It \u2019 s hard to say . But what\u2014do we know that money went into the Clinton Foundation from interests that had business before the State Department ? Absolutely . And I think that is the fundamental\u2014that is the fundamental issue at play here .\nAMY GOODMAN : David Sirota , thanks so much for being with us , senior editor for investigations at the International Business Times . We will link to your articles at democracynow.org .\nThis is \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! When we come back , we \u2019 ll be joined by Danny Glover and the well-known anti-police brutality activist Larry Hamm , talking about Hillary Clinton , U.S. politics and police brutality .
