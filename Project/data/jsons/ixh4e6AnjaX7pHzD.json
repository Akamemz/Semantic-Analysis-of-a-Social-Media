    "content": "Not that long ago , the Tenth Amendment was the new hotness in Republican circles .\nShortly after President Obama took office , Republicans looked to the amendment \u2014 a states \u2019 rights provision providing that the federal government \u2019 s powers are not limitless \u2014 as a way to prevent the federal government from doing much of anything at all . The backbone of the 2012 Supreme Court challenge to Obamacare was a broad reading of the Tenth Amendment . Fox News segments and Tea Party rallies featured extravagant claims that everything from Medicare to Social Security to the minimum wage all violated the Tenth Amendment .\nFast-forward to the present , however , and the Tenth Amendment is even more gauche than wide lapels and bell-bottoms \u2014 at least in the Trump Justice Department .\nLast week , the Trump administration filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to hear United States v. California , a challenge to a California \u201c sanctuary state \u201d law that prevents state law enforcement officers from assisting federal immigration officers who seek to deport certain undocumented immigrants . The crux of the administration \u2019 s argument is that its immigration policies are immune to a long-standing Tenth Amendment doctrine that historically was championed by conservative justices .\nCalifornia , in other words , is not just an important immigration case . It is , if the Court takes it up , an integrity test for the Supreme Court \u2019 s Republican majority . The core question in California is whether the Court will exempt the Trump administration \u2019 s deportation policies from a states \u2019 rights doctrine known as \u201c anti-commandeering , \u201d which typically prohibits the federal government from giving orders to state officials .\nFor the last quarter century , conservatives were all about anti-commandeering . The Trump administration \u2019 s argument suggests that they \u2019 re more flexible about the principle now that this particular Republican president is in power .\nAnd if the Court grants Trump this exemption from the Tenth Amendment , it is an ominous sign that it could decide that other provisions of the Constitution also don \u2019 t apply to Trump \u2019 s other immigration policies .\nCalifornia prohibits its law enforcement officers from being complicit in many of Trump \u2019 s deportation policies\nIn 2017 , California enacted a trio of laws that make it harder for the Trump administration to pursue harsh immigration policies within the state \u2019 s borders . The Trump administration wants the Supreme Court to block one of these laws , the California Values Act ( CVA ) .\nBroadly speaking , CVA instructs state and local police not to cooperate with federal immigration officials who want them to detain a particular immigrant or who want help identifying and rounding up many undocumented immigrants as those immigrants are released from state jails and prisons .\nThe CVA prohibits California state and local law enforcement officers from \u201c inquiring into an individual \u2019 s immigration status. \u201d It does not allow these officers to detain \u201c an individual on the basis of a hold request \u201d from federal immigration authorities . And it prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from \u201c providing information regarding a person \u2019 s release ... unless that information is available to the public . \u201d\nThe law does contain several significant exceptions to these general policies . State officials may transfer someone to federal immigration authorities , for example , if those authorities produce \u201c a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination. \u201d Immigrants convicted of especially serious crimes , such as \u201c a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison , \u201d are not protected by the CVA .\nIn most states , it \u2019 s common for state law enforcement agencies to work closely with federal immigration officials to identify undocumented immigrants in their custody and to transfer those immigrants to the feds once the immigrant is released . CVA seeks to prevent this kind of cooperation , at least with respect to immigrants who commit minor offenses or who are arrested but not convicted .\nAs the Trump administration complains , CVA effectively requires federal immigration officers to \u201c stake out a jail and seek to make a public arrest \u201d if it wants to catch a particular immigrant as they are leaving that facility . That \u2019 s a significant drain on federal resources in order to round up low-level offenders .\nIt \u2019 s well established that state police do not have to cooperate with federal officials\nAs mentioned above , the California litigation turns on something known as the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine , a legal doctrine derived from the Tenth Amendment , which typically prevents the federal government from ordering state officials to act against the wishes of their state .\nThe Tenth Amendment is a single sentence : \u201c The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people. \u201d Thus , the Constitution gives Congress a laundry list of enumerated powers and federal law can not reach beyond the scope of these powers .\nAccording to the Supreme Court , the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine flows from this general rule that the federal government may not do anything it \u2019 s not specifically authorized to do in the Constitution . As the Court explained in Murphy v. NCAA ( 2018 ) , \u201c conspicuously absent from the list of powers given to Congress is the power to issue direct orders to the governments of the States . \u201d\nThe federal government has broad authority to prohibit many activities , and it also has broad power to exclude non-citizens from the United States . But the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine says the federal government may not order states to enforce federal law . If the feds want to deport undocumented immigrants who live in California , it may do so . But it must hire its own agents to find and arrest these immigrants . It can not order California to assist federal immigration officers if California does not want to provide this assistance .\nWhich brings us back to the California Values Act . The CVA is a pretty straightforward application of California \u2019 s rights under the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine . California did not order its police to actively resist federal officials who seek to enforce immigration laws . It merely said that those police will not assist federal immigration officials .\nAnd , under the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine , the federal government can not \u201c issue direct orders to \u201d those state police . That means that California may withhold assistance to federal law enforcement .\nThe Anti-Commandeering Doctrine was created and incubated by conservative justices\nThe Anti-Commandeering Doctrine arose out of the Court \u2019 s 6-3 decision in New York v United States ( 1992 ) , a decision joined by every member of the Court \u2019 s conservative bloc plus the moderate liberal Justice David Souter . That decision struck down a federal law that required some states to take responsibility for low-level radioactive waste generated within their borders .\nThe doctrine next arose in Printz v. United States ( 1997 ) , which split the Court along familiar 5-4 lines , with the conservative majority striking down a federal law \u201c commanding state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers. \u201d The Court \u2019 s most recent anti-commandeering case , Murphy , also united the Court \u2019 s conservative bloc in the majority , with the Court \u2019 s liberal bloc dividing on whether to apply the doctrine in that case .\nThe point is that conservative justices have historically championed the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine while liberal attitudes toward it range from acquiescence to outright resistance . And that \u2019 s not really surprising . It makes sense that members of a political faction that tends to be sympathetic to states \u2019 rights arguments would support something like anti-commandeering .\nThe Trump administration , however , asks the Republican-controlled Supreme Court to effectively create an immigration exception to this doctrine . And its arguments are not especially convincing .\nMuch of the administration \u2019 s petition asking the Supreme Court to hear the California case turns on Arizona v. United States ( 2012 ) , which stuck down parts of a state law that sought to impose a harsher immigration regime within Arizona than federal law permitted . \u201c The Government of the United States has broad , undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens , \u201d the Supreme Court declared in Arizona .\nBut California does not question the federal government \u2019 s power over immigration and the status of aliens . California merely says that it will not contribute to certain enforcement efforts by the federal government . Arizona was not an anti-commandeering case . Indeed , it was the exact opposite : It was a case about a state that wanted to do more immigration enforcement than the federal government desired .\nArizona has nothing to say about how the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine should apply to California and the Trump administration \u2019 s reliance on it is a non sequitur .\nOther parts of the Trump administration \u2019 s argument , meanwhile , are downright imperial . Consider this passage :\nCalifornia \u2019 s ability to hold aliens in its criminal system derives from the federal government \u2019 s decision to let it do so . Aliens are present and may remain in the United States only as provided for under the auspices of federal immigration law . It therefore is the United States , not California , that \u201c retains the right \u201d to set the conditions under which aliens in this country may be detained , released , and removed .\nThe administration appears to be saying that all non-citizens present in the United States are only here through the sufferance of the federal government . Thus , California may not even enforce its own criminal laws against those immigrants unless it does so on the federal government \u2019 s terms .\nBut this argument completely misunderstands why the rule against commandeering exists . As the Court explained in Murphy , \u201c both the Federal Government and the States wield sovereign powers. \u201d The federal government may wield its enumerated powers as it chooses , but \u201c all other legislative power is reserved for the States , as the Tenth Amendment confirms. \u201d That includes California \u2019 s power to enact criminal laws and to enforce those laws against immigrants who violate them \u2014 without having to give up its own rights under the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine in the process .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s argument , in other words , is not convincing . And it shouldn \u2019 t convince any judge who claims to be committed to the principles that the Supreme Court announced in New York , Printz , and Murphy .\nWe \u2019 ll find out soon whether the Supreme Court \u2019 s Republican majority will remain committed to those principles , however , now that the Trump administration finds them inconvenient .",
