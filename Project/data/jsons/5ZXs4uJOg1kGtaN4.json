Who, exactly, is \"Individual A\"?\n\nThe indictment describes \"Individual A\" as the subject of Hastert's \"prior misconduct,\" but offers very few clues. The best seems to be \"Individual A has been a resident of Yorkville and has known Hastert most of Individual A's life.\" The \"Individual A\" met with Hastert \"multiple times\" in 2010 and \"discussed past misconduct against Individual A that had occurred years earlier.\" It was during those meetings, and later talks, that Hastert allegedly agreed to pay $3.5 million.\n\n2. When did the alleged abuse happen?\n\nThe indictment reveals only that \"Individual A\" met with Hastert sometime around 2010 and at one point \"discussed past misconduct ... that had occurred years earlier.\" There's no indication of how long ago that was, but it may have been years or even decades, as Individual A \"has been a resident of Yorkville, Ill. and has known Hastert most of their life,\" per the indictment.\n\nOn Friday, his former colleagues expressed shock at the indictment, saying there was no whiff of scandal from Hastert during his time in Congress.\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense to me,\" said Rick Santorum, who served in the House with Hastert, on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"It certainly seems very much out of character.\"\n\nFormer Virginia Republican Rep.

Why did it take so long to come out?\n\nThe indictment lists relevant facts as including Hastert's time working as a teacher and coach in Yorkville for 16 years. But Hastert was not apparoached by \"Individual A\" until 2010. From 2010 until 2014, Hastert first negotiated with and then made secret payments to the unknown subject.\n\nBut charges were not filed against Hastert until Thursday, a half century after the first relevant date listed in the indictment.",
