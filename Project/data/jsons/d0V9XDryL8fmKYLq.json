But on the night that Democrats cast their primary ballots in six states across the Midwest , South , and Northwest \u2014 including the important state of Michigan , which played such a significant role four years ago \u2014 it became abundantly clear that former vice president Joe Biden is bound to become the party 's choice to take on President Donald Trump on Election Day .\nMarch 10 , 2020 is the day that Biden became all but unbeatable .\nThis is n't because Biden will come out of the day 's six contests with an insurmountable delegate lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders . It 's because today 's wins will likely be followed by Biden beating Sanders in Florida next Tuesday by around 40 points , and in Illinois , Ohio , and Arizona by double digits on the same day . And this will likely be followed by Biden victories in Georgia , New York , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Connecticut , Delaware , and numerous other delegate-rich states across the country , allowing him to lock down the nomination .\nWe know that this is the overwhelmingly likely outcome not only because that 's what the polls are telling us . We also know it because the results on Tuesday night confirm what 's been clear since Super Tuesday , which is that Biden is doing better than Hillary Clinton did the last time around , and Sanders is doing significantly worse .\nThe Mississippi results are consistent with both Biden 's showing in South Carolina on Feb. 29 and Clinton 's in Mississippi four years ago : The more centrist , establishment candidate wins with roughly 80 percent of the vote , while the insurgent democratic socialist finishes in the mid-teens , largely because of the ideologically moderate black vote in the South .

But to it has been added at least one more : He is no longer running against Hillary Clinton .\nIt may be unfair to Biden to put it that way , but it 's hard to look at the results in Michigan , in particular , without wondering just how much of the 2016 results in that state , both in the primaries and in the general election , were a function of the unique dislike the former first lady and secretary of state was capable of generating among voters .\nConsider : Sanders shocked the political world four years ago by defying the polls and narrowly beating Clinton in the Michigan primary . On Tuesday night , he appears to be on track to lose to Biden by roughly 13 percentage points . Sanders won Kalamazoo County by 22 points in 2016 . This time he narrowly lost it to Biden . In Washtenaw County , home of Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan , Sanders beat Clinton 55 to 43 percent . Against Biden , Sanders has lost it 48 to 46 percent .
