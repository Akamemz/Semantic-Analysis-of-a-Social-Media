    "content": "President Obama tried to tap a moderate to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , but he ended up picking a fight with powerful Second Amendment groups that say Judge Merrick Garland has shown antipathy toward gun rights .\nIn one 2000 case , Judge Garland , who sits on the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , upheld a Clinton administration effort to store gun-buyers \u2019 records .\nLater in the decade , he joined other judges in a failed bid to reconsider the landmark case that would eventually establish the Second Amendment \u2019 s protection of a personal right to bear arms .\n\u201c This is probably the most anti-gun Supreme Court nomination in decades , \u201d said Brian Rogers , executive director of America Rising Squared , a conservative group conducting opposition research on Judge Garland .\nJudge Garland was appointed to the D.C. circuit in 1997 after surviving a contentious Senate fight that centered more on whether that court needed another judge than on whether he was the right pick .\nNow , Judge Garland faces a similar fight . Republican senators say the Supreme Court can operate with eight justices until next year , when voters will have had a chance to choose the president whom they want to make the pick .\nIn the meantime , conservative groups have begun poring over Judge Garland \u2019 s 19-year record on the D.C. court and say even in the early stages of vetting , his association with Mr. Obama means he likely will take decidedly liberal views on issues such as abortion , the environment and executive authority .\n\u201c We do not know this nominee , but we do know Barack Obama , \u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the pro-life Susan B.

Cox , executive director of the National Rifle Association \u2019 s Institute for Legislative Action . \u201c Obama has already nominated two Supreme Court justices who oppose the right to own firearms , and there is absolutely no reason to think he has changed his approach this time . \u201d\nErich Pratt , executive director of the group Gun Owners of America , said Mr. Obama chose a \u201c radical leftist \u201d in Judge Garland despite promises to nominate a consensus candidate .\n\u201c He supported the D.C. gun ban in 2007 , thereby showing he opposes self-defense and opposes the right to keep and bear arms , \u201d Mr. Pratt said .\nThat 2007 case , Parker v. District of Columbia , ultimately became the landmark Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller . Before it reached the high court , it was heard in Judge Garland \u2019 s circuit , and a three-judge panel ruled that the D.C. handgun ban was unconstitutional . Judge Garland wasn \u2019 t part of that decision , but he did join three other judges in trying to have the full court get a chance to overturn the ruling .\nCarrie Severino , chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative advocacy group , concluded in a recent piece for National Review that the 2007 vote means Judge Garland would ultimately support overturning the Supreme Court \u2019 s Heller decision and that he has a \u201c very liberal view of gun rights. \u201d Ms. Severino \u2019 s group has pledged a $ 2 million advertising campaign to oppose Mr. Obama \u2019 s nominee .\nRepublican senators had already decided to block the nomination process , citing election-year precedent in saying the next president should be the one to fill the vacancy .\nThe offices of several pro-gun Democrats did not offer a comment on Judge Garland \u2019 s record .\nBut House Republicans said the judge \u2019 s gun record must be part of any debate .\n\u201c In 2007 , Garland tried to inflict one of the most restrictive gun laws in the country , ignoring the Second Amendment rights for residents of the District of Columbia , \u201d said Rep.

Blake Farenthold , Texas Republican , also said he hopes the Senate \u201c takes a strong stand against a nominee that has shown he is no friend to the Constitution and no friend to the right to keep and bear arms . \u201d\nConservatives are also pointing to a 2000 case in which Mr. Garland was part of a 2-1 panel that voted to uphold a Clinton administration policy of retaining certain gun transaction records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System for six months .
