    "content": "Nearly 16 months after the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost and CIA annex in Benghazi , Libya , the details about the perpetrators , their tactics and their motives continue to get spun , bounced and reinterpreted like a political pingpong ball .\nThe latest player was The New York Times , which over the weekend ran a detailed article about what Libyan militias think happened during the attack under a sweeping headline that critics claimed appeared bent on politically absolving former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton . The newspaper unequivocally asserted its reporters found \u201c no evidence that al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault . \u201d\nBut current and former U.S. officials , congressional sources and outside analysts briefed on the attack told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday that the U.S. intelligence community \u2019 s assessment about al Qaeda \u2019 s links to the Benghazi tragedy has not changed .\nThe consensus , they said , remains today , as it has for more than a year , that Islamic extremists with ties to al Qaeda and its evolving North African affiliates executed the attack , which was preceded by some degree of planning despite being launched during a spontaneous opportunity that presented itself on the 11th anniversary of al Qaeda \u2019 s horrific Sept. 11 attacks on the United States .\n\u201c The intelligence community has not changed its position from Day One as far as its position of al Qaeda and its involvement in the attack , \u201d Rep. Lynn A. Westmoreland , Georgia Republican and a key member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said in a telephone interview Monday . \u201c As far as the intelligence community goes , they still understand that it was definitely al Qaeda-linked . \u201d\nThe CIA on Monday pointedly stayed on the sidelines of the latest dispute and refused to address The Times \u2019 assessment . But those briefed by the agency repeatedly over the past year unleashed fury at the New York newspaper .\nMr. Westmoreland said The New York Times evidently spoke with many militants and other sources on the ground inside Libya for its article , but he got \u201c kind of a shock \u201d that it appeared the paper was making assertions without having interviewed any of the U.S. intelligence officials on the ground at the CIA annex in Benghazi when it came under attack last year .\nThose officials testified in October during a hearing of the House Intelligence subcommittee on oversight and investigations . \u201c The reality of it is , you can tell more about what people think if you \u2019 re listening to them when they don \u2019 t know you \u2019 re listening , \u201d said Mr. Westmoreland , who is chairman of the subcommittee .\nIn essence , the congressman said , he trusts the testimony of intelligence sources who were in Benghazi before and during the attack more than any recollection by militants claiming to have knowledge of what occurred .\nAlthough transcripts of the testimony provided by intelligence officials during the October hearing remain classified , Mr. Westmoreland said that \u201c from their observation , it was a planned attack . \u201d\n\u201c These guys just saw that the attackers had at least some type of training , or coordinated movements about where to go and what each person was going to do when they were on the ground , \u201d Mr. Westmoreland said . \u201c So from that standpoint , it was a coordinated attack . \u201d\nFurthermore , he said , the overall assessment provided to the committee by the intelligence community \u201c just leads you to believe , or to know that [ the attackers ] were al Qaeda-related . \u201d\nMr. Westmoreland \u2019 s assessment dovetailed with comments Sunday by Rep. Mike Rogers , Michigan Republican and the intelligence committee \u2019 s chairman .\nAlthough some Republican lawmakers have been accused of aggressively politicizing the Benghazi attack as a way to smear the Obama administration and tarnish Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s record as secretary of state , some Democrats also have criticized the story in The New York Times .\nMost notably , a top staffer in the office of Rep. Adam B. Schiff , California Democrat , said Monday that Mr. Schiff was standing by assertions he made during an interview on \u201c Fox News Sunday \u201d that there was at least some connection between al Qaeda and some of the militia groups involved in the attack , but that the incident did not appear to be a planned attack by the core al Qaeda group founded by Osama bin Laden .\nMr. Schiff was careful to assert that he did not think The New York Times intentionally attempted to use the story to exonerate the State Department for security lapses in Benghazi , but he said outright that \u201c the intelligence indicates that al Qaeda was involved . \u201d\n\u201c But , \u201d he added , \u201c there were also plenty of people and militias that were unaffiliated with al Qaeda that were involved . \u201d\nCounterterrorism analysts and former high-level officials indicated during interviews with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 last summer that the FBI , which was tasked by the Obama administration with carrying out an investigation into the attack , had settled on a broad conclusion : The attack was carried out by a combination of militants with varying degrees of connection to three Islamist groups : Ansar al-Sharia , the Muhammad Jamal network , and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .\nThe Pentagon \u2019 s own terrorism research agency concluded in August 2012 that \u201c al Qaeda senior leadership \u201d based in Pakistan was \u201c likely seeking to build a clandestine network in Libya as it pursues its strategy of reinforcing its presence in North Africa . \u201d\nThe report , published by the Library of Congress in coordination with the Irregular Warfare Support program , predicted that AQIM was \u201c likely to join hands with the al Qaeda clandestine network . \u201d\nMore specifically , the report \u2014 released roughly a month before the Benghazi attack \u2014 concluded that \u201c Ansar al-Sharia , led by Sufian Ben Qhumu , a former Guantanamo detainee , has increasingly embodied al Qaeda \u2019 s presence in Libya , as indicated by its active social-media propaganda , extremist discourse , and hatred of the West , especially the United States . \u201d\nAs a multinational network , AQIM is officially listed by the U.S. as a terrorist organization , and its operatives , along with members of Ansar al-Sharia and the Muhammad Jamal network , are believed to have participated in a series of terrorist assaults on Western interests in Benghazi during the months leading up to the storming of the U.S. diplomatic post and CIA house in the city .\nFormer officials and intelligence community sources have said dozens of foreign fighters linked to AQIM , and to the Egypt-based Muhammad Jamal network \u2014 whether from Egypt , Tunisia or elsewhere in North Africa \u2014 arrived in Benghazi in 2011 as part of a regional jihadist push to overthrow dictator Moammar Gadhafi . Many stayed on after his downfall and began working with operatives from Ansar al-Sharia .\nAmong the most vexing aspects of the investigation is that none of three groups has specifically claimed responsibility .\nAQIM issued a statement Sept. 18 \u2014 a week afterward \u2014 praising the attack , but did not claim credit for planning or executing it . Another statement around the same time , attributed to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , also did not claim responsibility .\nInvestigators have given significant attention to a video message circulated Sept. 10 in which al Qaeda \u2019 s senior leader , Ayman al-Zawahri , who is believed to be hiding in Pakistan , called for attacks on Americans in Libya to avenge the killing of a senior al Qaeda operative by a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan last year .\nSome analysts have argued that the al-Zawahri video proves al Qaeda \u2019 s involvement because it surely would have trickled down digitally to AQIM operatives during the hours before the attack . But that ignores a subsequent message put out by al-Zawahri roughly a month after the attack in which he made only passing reference to Benghazi , and notably avoided claiming responsibility for it .\nThat al Qaeda \u2019 s affiliates in North Africa are evolving rapidly , with operatives emerging in different areas , also has played into debates over exactly what transpired in Benghazi .\nFormer National Security Agency and CIA Director Michael V. Hayden alluded to such factors during an appearance Sunday on CBS , although he stopped short of directly disputing The New York Times \u2018 assertion that it had found no evidence of al Qaeda involvement in the attack , and instead praised the paper for other reporting in its weekend story . He said it provided broad view of a complex security landscape in Libya .\n\u201c When the attack happened , actually on this network a few days afterwards , I was asked who did it . And I said well , you know , the al Qaeda movement \u2019 s divided into three layers : al Qaeda prime , formally affiliated and like-minded . And at the time , I said this was probably high-end like-minded or low-end affiliated . And I think The Times story today kind of bears that out , \u201d Mr. Hayden said .\n\u201c The al Qaeda movement has changed , \u201d Mr. Hayden said . \u201d And actually , that \u2019 s probably the better word , not the al Qaeda organization , but the al Qaeda movement . \u201d\nMr. Hayden told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Monday that there are still uncertainties about who precisely executed and ordered the attack , but that he could say with confidence that the perpetrators were \u201c al Qaeda affiliated if al Qaeda is viewed as a movement , a cause , a concept . \u201d\nOne example of the change can be seen in Ansar al-Sharia . Although the group had been considered local in Libya , advocating for the implementation of Islamist law , indications over the past year suggest it is now involved in sending jihadist fighters to join the Nusrah Front , a group in Syria that the State Department has said is an alias for al Qaeda in Iraq .\n\u201c The fact that Ansar is sending fighters to Syria shows you they \u2019 re part of the global jihad and not just some strictly local group , \u201d Thomas Joscelyn , a senior fellow focusing on al Qaeda and North Africa at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , said in an interview Monday .\nMr. Joscelyn , who manages the foundation \u2019 s Long War Journal , said The New York Times story was strong in that \u201c the reporter did a lot of on-the-ground talking to people , \u201d but that it \u201c missed the mark in terms of analysis . \u201d\n\u201c You can see that when one of the main Democrats on the House intelligence committee comes out and says that al Qaeda was involved , obviously there \u2019 s intelligence showing that , which conflicts with The New York Times \u2018 declarative statements on the whole thing , \u201d Mr. Joscelyn said .\nMore troublesome , he said , is the fact that on Oct. 29 , 2012 , the paper itself cited unidentified \u201c American officials \u201d as saying the Benghazi attack \u201c included participants from Ansar al Sharia , al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Muhammad Jamal network . \u201d\n\u201c Nothing in the sources I \u2019 ve talked to have said that was wrong , \u201d said Mr. Joscelyn , who noted that David D.
