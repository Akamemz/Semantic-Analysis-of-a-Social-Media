    "content": "( CNN ) Former Vice President Joe Biden 's efforts to fend off criticism about his touchy , intimate style with women has renewed scrutiny of his leadership in 1991 when the Senate heard law professor Anita Hill 's sexual harassment claims against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas .\nThat episode could ultimately present more of a problem for Biden as he considers a 2020 presidential run . The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time , he has long had to defend himself against complaints that he did not take Hill 's allegations seriously and , after being pressured to hold a hearing on her claims , presided over a circus-like forum in which Hill was humiliated .\nHill , then a law professor at the University of Oklahoma and now at Brandeis University , alleged that Thomas harassed her with talk of pornography when she worked for him in the 1980s at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Department of Education .\nIn Biden 's most recent statements on the episode , he described the senators who took Hill 's testimony as `` a bunch of white guys ... a committee that did n't fully understand what the hell it was all about . ''\n`` We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then , over 30 years ago , '' Biden said last month in New York , adding of Hill , `` she paid a terrible price . She was abused for the hearing . ... Her reputation was attacked . I wish I could have done something . ''\nYet Biden , as committee chairman , was no helpless bystander , and his actions at the time contrasted with others in his own category of `` white guys . '' As he continued to push for a Senate floor vote on Thomas immediately after the Hill charges leaked to the news media , Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan forcefully argued that the vote be postponed so her claims could be aired .\nDuring a dramatic set of days in early October 1991 , Moynihan helped prevent a scheduled Senate vote on Thomas before Hill had an opportunity to testify . ( Moynihan , 15 years older than Biden , died in 2003 . )\nWhile senators such as Moynihan were astounded when Hill 's allegations burst forth in news reports , Biden 's reaction was initially muted . He said that when he and other committee members learned of Hill 's complaints \u2014 weeks before they become public \u2014 Judiciary Committee members did not believe the information `` necessitated a delay in voting '' by the panel or the full Senate .\nAs the details of Hill 's allegations hit the airwaves and newspapers , Biden argued against a postponement .\n`` I see no reason why the addition of public disclosure of the allegations \u2014 but no new information about the charges themselves \u2014 should change this decision , '' he said on October 7 , the day before a scheduled vote on Thomas .\nScrutiny of the Senate handling of Hill has continually erupted over the years , as last fall when the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Christine Blasey Ford that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers in suburban Maryland . ( Kavanaugh and Thomas both categorically denied the respective assertions and were confirmed for the high court . )\nThe current flashback to 1991 , however , is focused on Biden as he appears to be preparing for a presidential bid and as a handful of women , beginning with Lucy Flores , a former candidate for Nevada lieutenant governor , have publicly complained about Biden 's hug and kisses .\nThe 76-year-old former Delaware senator and vice president said in an initial statement : `` In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life , I have offered countless handshakes , hugs , expressions of affection , support and comfort . And not once \u2014 never \u2014 did I believe I acted inappropriately . If it is suggested I did so , I will listen respectfully . But it was never my intention . ''\nOn Wednesday , Biden released a new video on Twitter , saying : `` Social norms are changing . I understand that , and I 've heard what these women are saying . ... I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future . ''\nHe followed that up at a labor union event on Friday , joking that he had permission to hug and touch certain individuals and then telling reporters more seriously , `` I am not sorry for anything that I have ever done \u2014 I 've never been disrespectful , intentionally , to a man or a woman . That 's not the reputation I 've had since I was in high school , for God 's sake . ''\nSome commentators reflecting on Biden 's old-style pattern , especially as it conflicts with today 's # MeToo awareness , have argued that his record from the Thomas-Hill hearings is more troubling .\n`` Attitudes of race , gender and power have shifted since the Obama White House \u2014 we are more suspicious and less forgiving when it comes to accepting excuses and soft apologies for past racial biases and sexual misconduct , '' Roxanne Jones , a former ESPN vice president , wrote in a CNN op-ed\nGail Collins in The New York Times on Thursday referred to his `` really nasty history on the Anita Hill matter , '' adding that after Hill `` had the courage to show up and testify before the world ... Biden ... did nothing but ask her embarrassing questions . ''\nDuring her testimony , Hill said , `` Telling the world is the most difficult experience of my life .
