    "content": "Gasoline prices have fallen more than 40 percent since the end of June thanks to the collapse of global oil prices . That makes this the perfect time for Congress to overcome its longstanding terror of offending the nation \u2019 s motorists and raise the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel . The results could only be beneficial : for the nation \u2019 s roads , bridges and transit systems , which badly need repair ; for the budget ; and , to the extent that higher taxes encourage greater fuel efficiency , for the climate .\nThe federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 cents on diesel has not been increased since 1993 . That has severely shortchanged the Highway Trust Fund , which is expected to run out of money in May if Congress does not transfer more into it or raise fuel taxes . If the federal tax on gasoline had simply kept up with inflation , it would be 30 cents today .\nThere is little doubt that the nation \u2019 s road and transit systems could use more help . The American Society of Civil Engineers gave them a nearly failing grade of D in 2013 ; the state of bridges is somewhat better , earning a C-plus . The country \u2019 s inadequate road and transit systems cost it billions through increased delays , extra fuel costs and auto repair bills . Poor road conditions are also said to play a significant factor in about one-third of all traffic fatalities , or about 10,000 deaths a year .\nSome lawmakers , including some Republicans , are concerned enough about these trends to discuss an increase in fuel taxes . Senator Bob Corker , Republican of Tennessee , has proposed increasing the tax , and Senator James Inhofe , Republican of Oklahoma and a big supporter of the energy industry , has said he is willing to consider it .
