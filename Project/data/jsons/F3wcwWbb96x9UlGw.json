But his rapid rise , appeal to millennial voters and newfound popularity among Hollywood and Silicon Valley donors stands to hinder her ability to lock down her backyard . And it could enable the 37-year-old mayor to net a solid cache of delegates from Harris \u2019 home state \u2014 perhaps even more than he can capture in early voting states like Nevada or Iowa .\nDemocratic strategist Garry South says the growing buzz about Buttigieg \u2019 s success in wedging his way into California \u2019 s lucrative fundraising base has shocked many longtime politics watchers in the state .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
