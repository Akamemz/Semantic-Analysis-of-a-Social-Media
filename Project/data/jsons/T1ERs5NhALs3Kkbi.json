    "content": "President Barack Obama is on the road this week talking up the United States economy . But he also appears increasingly aware that significant threats are building that could derail U.S. growth and make his last two years in office a difficult slog .\n\u201c Our economy has been growing , we \u2019 ve got momentum , \u201d Obama said Thursday in Louisville , Kentucky , the first leg of a trip that will take him to Salt Lake City , Utah , on Friday where he will comment on a March jobs report that showed a gain of just 126,000 , well below expectations and the weakest number since December of 2013 . \u201c But that momentum can stall , \u201d Obama added . \u201c Because the economies in Europe are weak , the economies in Asia are weak , the dollar is becoming stronger because a lot of people want to park their money here , they think it \u2019 s safer , but that makes our exports more expensive . So we \u2019 ve got to stay hungry . \u201d\nThe disappointing March jobs report , which also showed the size of the labor force shrinking by 96,000 , suggests that Obama \u2019 s fears of a stalling economy may already be coming true . And that \u2019 s an issue not just for a lame duck incumbent looking to juice weak approval numbers . It could also seriously complicate matters for Obama \u2019 s would-be successor , Hillary Clinton , who could wind up squaring off against a GOP opponent promising \u2014 fairly or not \u2014an end to the desultory growth rates of the Obama years .\nRepublicans jumped on the weak employment report . \u201c This report clearly shows that President Obama \u2019 s efforts have not done enough to grow our economy and create jobs fast enough , \u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a prepared statement .\nBeyond Friday \u2019 s jobs number , a wide range of other indicators suggest growth nearly stopped in the first quarter of the year .\nManufacturing is declining , and consumers are not spending despite a huge cash infusion from cheap gas prices . The housing market remains relatively weak . And while the jobless rate is close to where it was before the financial crisis , middle class incomes are not rising , the size of the labor force remains near a 30-year low and few economists see prospects for much faster growth on the horizon .\n\u201c The economy right now is very much at risk , \u201d said Lindsey Piegza , chief economist at investment firm Sterne Agee . \u201c We are in a soft patch unquestionably . The question is how much of a soft patch . We are slowly losing momentum , and I don \u2019 t think the rest of the year is going be anything to write home about . \u201d\nWhite House officials insist that there are many bright spots in the current economy and they largely dismiss alarmism over a possible backslide .\nJason Furman , chairman of the president \u2019 s Council of Economic Advisers , recently told Congress the White House still \u201c expects that the economy will continue to grow at an above-trend rate and that the unemployment rate will decline further. \u201d Furman added that less fiscal brinkmanship could allow the economy to overcome a winter slowdown and speed up heading into the fall . Furman on Friday said \u201c a range of factors including the weather and the global economic slowdown have affected economic data for the first quarter . \u201d\nThere is also a very real threat that a recent period of fiscal calm may end this year with major fights in Congress over funding the government past Sept. 30 and raising the debt limit . Republicans are likely to seek major concessions from the president heading into the 2016 campaign year , and the White House and Congressional Democrats are equally likely to want to resist any significant spending cuts .\nThe effect on business and consumer confidence could be serious . Big fights over lifting the debt limit in 2011 , the \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d in 2012 and the government shutdown in 2013 all helped derail previous periods of faster economic growth . Brinkmanship took something of a holiday in 2014 but returned this year with the fight over funding the Department of Homeland Security . That may have been just a prelude to a much bigger fight this fall .\n\u201c There will have to be an extraction of concessions of some sort from the president to Republicans to get the debt limit raised , \u201d said Jason Rosenstock , a Washington analyst at Thorn Run Partners .\nObama \u2019 s approach in recent weeks \u2014 and on his current economic tour \u2014 has been to tout strong jobs numbers and hammer away at Republicans for what he describes as their \u201c top down \u201d approach to economic policy . This week he is focusing on GOP support for eliminating the estate tax . The White House also hopes positive feeling from progress in talks over a nuclear deal with Iran will also help boost the president \u2019 s approval rating .\nBut polling regularly shows that American attitudes toward the occupant of the White House are tied directly to the performance of the economy , no matter whether an opposition party in Congress may be making things more difficult . And after some hopeful signs of a possible liftoff last year \u2014 including 5 percent growth in the third quarter \u2014 indicators are once again pointing south . Economists mostly agree that growth in the first quarter was probably close to zero after increasing just 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year .\nData this week showed consumer spending rising just 0.1 percent in February . That followed two months of declines . This came despite low gas prices leaving more money in people \u2019 s wallets . Consumers say they feel confident \u2014 driven by consistent good news on job growth \u2014 but they are not displaying that confidence by spending more .\nThis is probably because wage gains remain largely nonexistent . Average hourly wages for workers are up just 2 percent for the year . That means Obama risks talking up an economy that people don \u2019 t actually feel very good about . \u201c We are seeing no upward pressure on wages and very little growth so it \u2019 s risky for the president to be out there overpromising and overhyping something that could turn around and disappear , \u201d said Piegza . Obama \u2019 s more cautious tone in Louisville suggests he is well aware of this risk .\nBeyond fiscal brinkmanship , there is another potentially significant headwind facing an already struggling economy : the prospect of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve later this year .\nThe Fed , led by Janet Yellen , has indicated a strong desire to move away from its crisis-era policy of effectively below-zero rates soon , perhaps as early as June . Some economists worry this could further slow growth and block a long hoped-for increase in workers \u2019 take-home pay .\nIf the Fed gets it wrong , it could not only make Obama \u2019 s last two years a tough ride , it could leave Hillary Clinton with a badly struggling economy as she tries to sell voters on four more years of Democratic leadership in the White House . Clinton supporters are very attuned to the fact that the former first lady \u2019 s fate may hinge in part on Janet Yellen \u2019 s success pulling off a tough turn in monetary policy .\n\u201c If they make a mistake and move too fast and people get spooked , the economy cold stall and there won \u2019 t be that much fuel in the tank if it does , \u201d said Larry Summers , a former Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton who lost out to Yellen for the top job at the Fed . \u201c And , on the other hand , if they wait slightly too long , price levels will be just a few tenths of a percent higher and that might actually be a positive thing . \u201d\nTo some extent , even the prospect of Fed rate hikes has already hit the U.S. economy by driving up the dollar ( it \u2019 s more valuable to own the currency if the Fed is hiking rates ) and thus making U.S. exports more expensive for global buyers , as Obama noted . Some of this is the result of Europe continuing to struggle with the Greek debt crisis and its own very slow growth . But the net result is lower corporate profits , which dropped 3 percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year , the biggest decline since the first quarter of 2011 .\nShrinking corporate profits in turn make stocks look more expensive . Few market watchers are calling for giant declines in stock prices . But market indices , especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq , are at the high end of historical valuation levels , meaning a big flameout or two among high-flying tech stocks could cause a significant correction .\nStill , the prospect the U.S. economy heading into another significant decline is far from a uniform view . The hiring picture remains fairly robust , and there are at least some signs of upward pressure on wages . Announcements by McDonald \u2019 s and other big employers voluntarily hiking their minimum wage suggests they are beginning to worry that a tighter labor market could cost them workers . And the one bright spot in the March jobs report showed hourly wages ticking up 7 cents to $ 24.86 .\nAnd at least some of the weakness in the first quarter was once again due to brutal weather . Some spending , business investment and construction that should have taken place over the winter months will certainly show up in the spring , pushing up growth numbers . And if wages do finally tick up , then the good jobs reports could actually lead to higher spending , which drives most economic activity .\n\u201c I do think we will return to better growth the rest of the year , \u201d said Nigel Gault , co-chief economist of the Parthenon Group . \u201c The underlying domestic economy is still doing fairly well , and we should see some improvements in housing and consumer spending . And I do think the Fed will be very cautious . \u201d\nIf Gault is wrong and wages stay stuck while the Fed hikes rates too fast and the dollar continues to spike , that one quarter of 5 percent growth could be the fading high water mark of the Obama economy . Throw in a few fiscal fights in Congress and Democrats could be looking to hold the White House next year in the midst of a genuine slowdown .",
