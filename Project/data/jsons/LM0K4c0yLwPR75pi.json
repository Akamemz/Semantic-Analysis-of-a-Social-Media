    "content": "Eric Bolling said two phone calls from President Trump and a number of over-the-phone prayers from Pat Robertson comforted him in the dark days following his son 's sudden opioid overdose death .\nBolling , a former Fox News personality , and best-selling author was interviewed by Pat Robertson on Monday 's 700 Club .\nBolling said , `` You called , you reached out at a very important time in my and my wife 's struggle through this tragedy , '' he said . `` Thank you for praying with us . ''\nHis 19-year-old son Eric Chase Bolling died while attending the University of Colorado . His father saw no signs of a drug problem and said his son 's death took him completely by surprise . `` Second year of school , terrific grades , no indication of anything , '' he said .\nBolling said an autopsy revealed his son took a pill containing a lethal amount of an opioid .\n`` He was at college . He took a Xanax , which apparently , I did n't know this until now , is what a lot of college kids do to relax . '' he continued . `` This Xanax happened not to be prescriptive . It was laced with Fentanyl . It was a Chinese knock-off that was produced in China but had Fentanyl in it to make it stronger . Fentanyl is a very , very strong opioid . ''\nJust a tiny amount of Fentanyl can be deadly . It 's often added to a number of street drugs , such as heroin , to make them stronger .\n`` In the weeks following that , Pat , you were amazing . You reached out to us . We were in the depths of grief and did n't know where to go . You and I sat on the phone several times and prayed . Thank you for that , '' he said .\nBolling said within 24 hours of his son 's death he received a phone call from President Trump .\n`` I 've been friendly with the president for a long time . The president said , 'Eric there 's nothing I can do to make this feel better . Just know that you have my support , ' '' he recalled .\nWeeks later , on Thanksgiving Day , Bolling said President Trump called him again , saying , `` I 'm just thinking about how this is the first holiday without your son . If there 's anything I can do , let me know . ''\nBolling said the call meant a lot to him . `` I realized at that moment that President Trump has compassion , he 's caring , he has empathy for people who are going through what my wife and I are going through . ''\nSince his son 's death , Bolling has worked with the president to combat the opioid epidemic . Bolling produced a video presented at the White House Opioid Summit last month . `` It 's a new push to create awareness across the country among both parents and their children . ''\n`` Parents need to be removed from this whole , 'not my kid ' syndrome , ' '' which he said is a form of denial about a child 's vulnerability to opioids . He continued , `` Parents think their kid is too popular , too smart or too athletic , '' adding opioid overdose deaths can happen the first time a person takes a drug .\n`` From the kids ' standpoint , I do n't think a lot of young people realize that one pill can kill . And that 's what happened unfortunately with our son . He took a pill . It was one pill and he did n't wake up . ''\nOpioid overdoses claimed the lives of more than 64,000 Americans in 2016 , the most since records have been kept . Since 2000 , a half million people have overdosed on opioids which include prescription painkillers , heroin , and Fentanyl .\nThe Trump administration has declared the opioid epidemic a `` public health emergency '' and has secured $ 6 billion to tackle the crisis , with plans to launch anti-drug commercials , grant waivers to states for treatment , and even to provide free Narcan , a drug that counteracts the effects of a drug overdose , to schools and colleges .\nThe president also wants to fortify the southern border , where many opioids enter the country . And he 's calling on Homeland Security to look into ways of stopping opioids from being sent through the mail .",
