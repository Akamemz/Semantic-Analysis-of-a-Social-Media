They struck up a friendship , and after Riggleman won the hard-fought race , the couple asked him to officiate their wedding at a nearby vineyard that summer .\n`` It was so exciting and such an honor for Alex and Rek to ask me to conduct a same-sex wedding , '' Riggleman told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News , calling the pair friends who `` obviously love each other . ''\nBut some of the GOP activists in the Southern , rural-heavy district were furious that Riggleman would marry two men . A trio of Republican county committees officially censured him , and a similar attempt at the district level fell just short .\nREAD : This Democratic governor 's response to coronavirus could decide who controls the Senate next year\n\u201c We kind of expected some folks might be upset , but we weren \u2019 t expecting how fiercely angry and persistent they would be about it , \u201d LeCounte told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News . \u201c It \u2019 s frustrating . It \u2019 s unpleasant . The fact that there are all these people around the district who have opinions about our wedding is a very bizarre thought . \u201d\nNow , the congressman is facing a real test against a hard-right candidate in a race where a small cadre of diehard activists will determine if he gets renominated .\nOne of the activists who expressed outrage about the wedding was Bob Good , then the athletic director at Liberty University , a birthplace of the modern Religious Right that lies just outside the district .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t flaunt your apparently progressive/liberal values in front of the conservative Republican base in the district and expect to not catch any flak for it , \u201d Good said on Facebook after posting a write-up of the wedding from the Washington Post .\nGood , who didn \u2019 t respond to multiple requests for comment for this story , isn \u2019 t just hitting Riggleman on this issue : He \u2019 s also criticized the congressman for supporting marijuana decriminalization and immigrant visa work programs , and has accused him of being insufficiently pro-life because Riggleman supports exceptions for rape , incest , and the life of the mother . But it \u2019 s clear what issue is motivating him and his allies .\n\u201c I have a biblical view of marriage , very different from the congressman \u2019 s view on that , \u201d Good said at a February event . \u201c He felt it was so important to show his view of marriage to conduct a gay wedding . He married a couple of gentlemen to make a statement , make a political statement , show that he \u2019 s a big-tent progressive new kind of Republican . \u201d\nIf this were a normal primary , Riggleman would have little to fear . Except for his odd interest in bigfoot \u2014 and an inside joke about bigfoot erotica that became one of the 2018 cycle 's weirdest scandals \u2014 there \u2019 s not that much about Riggleman \u2019 s resume that would put him in jeopardy in the GOP-leaning district .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a blue state , and the dumbest thing we could do as a party right now is take out those Republicans who have won . \u201d\nRiggleman has raised $ 1.4 million , 10 times the amount Good has brought in . A member of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus , he has support from its current chairman , Rep. Andy Biggs ( R-Ariz. ) , and its former chairman , Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) . He secured a coveted endorsement from President Trump , the only name that matters in modern GOP politics .\nRiggleman even has the backing of Good \u2019 s old boss : Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. , a close Trump ally and a leading right-wing evangelical , is supporting the congressman despite their sharply divergent views on same-sex marriage .\nBut in Virginia , local officials get to decide whether to hold primaries , which allow all voters in the district to easily cast ballots , or opt for much more byzantine and time-consuming conventions . This time , the local committee \u2014 a board with a number of people who slammed Riggleman for his views on gay marriage , including two people currently working on Good \u2019 s campaign \u2014 opted for a convention .\nThe current plan will force voters to drive up to three hours , then wait in their cars to vote in what might be the first-ever drive-thru political convention . That \u2019 s a hard sell for the average voter . The convention site just so happens to be at a church just a few miles from Good 's home , near the southern end of a central Virginia district that sprawls more than 200 miles south from D.C. \u2019 s exurbs to the North Carolina border .\n\u201c Has there ever been a drive-thru convention in the history of Virginia ? This is really ridiculous . It \u2019 s about disenfranchising as many people as possible , \u201d Riggleman said . \u201c They want to keep it small and control it all .
