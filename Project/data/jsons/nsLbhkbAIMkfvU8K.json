The wage would rise in steps , and after hitting the maximum in two years , would thereafter be indexed to inflation .\nIn the president 's first term , the unemployment rate was very high , peaking at 10 percent in October 2009 . And during those four years , Obama never seriously pushed Congress for legislation to force employers to pay more .\nTuesday night , he changed direction , saying in his State of the Union speech that he wants Congress to drive up wages for millions of workers by forcing up the benchmark minimum wage . Even though only a relatively small percentage of workers make $ 7.25 an hour , that pay level serves as a wage floor for all workers . When it moves higher , other wages ratchet up too .\nIn other words , if Congress were to boost the minimum hourly wage , then a person currently making $ 9 likely could move up to $ 10 or even $ 11 an hour as employers adjusted pay scales to higher levels to compete for the better low-wage workers .\nThe White House says 15 million workers would benefit directly from a higher minimum wage , but many economists say that millions more would gain too after taking into account the ripple effect as the whole wage scale moves up .\n`` We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day 's work with honest wages , '' Obama said . `` But today , a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $ 14,500 a year . ''\nHe said that 's not enough money to keep a family above the poverty line . `` Let 's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth , no one who works full time should have to live in poverty , and raise the federal minimum wage to $ 9 an hour . This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families .
