They want a leader they can support \u2013 someone who understands the economy and will support job creation , not create broad , business-choking rules often overturned by federal courts .\nThe eventual GOP presidential nominee has an opportunity to capitalize on this era of public discontent and lead our country forward , united behind a shared goal of economic prosperity and growth .
