    "content": "According to the Pew Research Centre , American voters are now more polarized than they have ever been as , \u201c the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades \u201d . This increasing level of partisanship has become glaringly apparent in many ways such as through the rise of the Tea Party ( grassroots conservative movements ) as well as the government shutdown of 2013 . More notably , evidence of this partisan gap can best be seen through the campaign platforms and actions of both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates .\nBoth Republican and Democratic candidates are saying things that their predecessors would have never dreamed of . For instance , Republican candidate Mike Huckabee suggested that he might be willing to use the American military to prevent women from getting abortions . While most Republicans vocalize their opposition to abortion , it is generally seen as a controversial issue to focus on in the general election , in which focusing on it is considered political suicide . The fact that Huckabee has brought this issue to centre stage with such a shocking suggestion is indicative of this political polarization .\nOn the left , there is Bernie Sanders whose campaign is gaining incredible traction as he is now trailing right behind the Democratic front runner , Hillary Clinton , in many political polls . What makes this so strange , especially for American politics , is that Sanders is a self-proclaimed democratic socialist . The very word \u201c socialist \u201d is generally used in American politics as a derogatory term for someone who wants to \u201c strip away liberties \u201d \u2013 proof that the Cold War played an enormous role in shaping the American identity . For more conservative Americans , this term still causes a visceral reaction . Yet now , there is a candidate who not only feels comfortable supporting more socialist policies but has openly admitted that he subscribes to socialist ideologies .\nOne of the reasons for the rise of partisan politics is found in the fact that these political divisions are greatest among those who are more politically active . Pew Research Report claims that , \u201c the majority [ of Americans ] do not have uniformly conservative or liberal views \u201d but the \u201c most ideologically oriented and politically rancourous Americans make their voices heard through greater participation in every stage of the political process \u201d . These vocal minorities can be seen as responding to the drastic and recent changes in the American economic climate .\nThe 2008 recession shocked the American psyche . The seemingly endless growth of the 90s came to an end and with it came waves of unemployment , lack of job security , and housing foreclosures . The recession coincided with many other issues such as the need to deal with the effects of climate change and the US slowly losing its position as the dominant geo-political entity on the world stage . Before , Americans were more content with the status quo but these sudden changes motivated many Americans , especially those who were most affected , to push for political change in all directions . The emergence of increasing partisanship and the vocal minorities behind it could be conceived as the resurgence of political experimentation in a time of great uncertainty \u2013 reasons for seeing this as the root cause of political polarization can again be found in recent changes in the various presidential campaigns as of late .\nThere are not only candidates who are polarizing their party \u2019 s basic platform but there are also those who are addressing issues generally considered peripheral to the party \u2019 s concern or possibly even opposed to the basic principles of their party . This is best exemplified by 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul whose libertarian principles brought him to butt heads with fellow Republicans on numerous occasions . As a libertarian-esque Republican Paul agreed with his fellow candidates on many fiscal issues but was in opposition to his party as he supported more socially liberal policies as well , such as the decriminalization of marijuana and was opposed to military interventionism . The popularity of such \u201c mixed \u201d platforms , that are not generically conservative or liberal , have ironically increased in tandem with the increased polarization of American politics .

The unbridled economic growth and stability of the 90s and early 2000s have dissipated and Americans are striving to reconcile themselves with that fact .
