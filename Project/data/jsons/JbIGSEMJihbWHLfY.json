It is Washington knows best , and it is wrong , '' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp , R-Michigan , in floor debate ahead of the Wednesday vote .\nRepublicans also complained that the bill known as Obamacare would fail to control spiraling health care costs , and that it included new taxes and fees despite the president 's promise not to raise middle-class taxes .\nTo Democrats , the entire exercise was an unnecessary repetition of past political posturing on a settled issue , now that the Supreme Court has upheld the law 's constitutionality .\n`` This repeal vote is a waste of time and tax dollars , '' said Rep. G.K. Butterfield , D-North Carolina , while Rep. Frank Pallone , D-New Jersey , noted , `` We 've had this debate so many times that it really sounds like we just keep repeating the same thing . ''\nOther legislators tried to liven up the rhetoric with references to popular culture .

Gingrey stood next to a poster featuring the character 's photo that said : `` You can have whatever you like ... as long as THE BOSS approves it . ''\n`` Let 's get rid of the boss , once and for all , '' Gingrey said .\nThe daylong GOP attacks were intended to ignite public opposition to the law and force Democrats to publicly defend it . Republicans made clear that the goal is to inspire voters to rally against the law and Obama in the November presidential election .\n`` If you give us more elected representatives to fix this problem , we will fix this problem in 2013 , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wisconsin , said in an interview with CNBC .\nWednesday 's vote will be the first on the subject since last month 's Supreme Court ruling , which Democrats argue should have ended the political debate over the health care law , rather than revive the Republican repeal effort .\nOn Monday , the White House formally notified House leaders that Obama will veto any repeal bill that manages to reach his desk , saying repeal `` would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve . ''\n`` The last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class , '' a White House statement said . `` Right now , the Congress needs to work together to focus on the economy and creating jobs .
