Rick Santorum ? Mike Huckabee ? Rick Perry ? They all ran and lost to the guy who won the nomination \u2014 and then lost \u2014 badly . Sarah Palin ? She lost so badly in 2008 she didn \u2019 t even make an effort in 2012 . The list of has-beens goes on and on .\nBut there are a few new faces \u2014 and thank God , because the 2016 nominee is going to have to be a whole new breed of Republican . After back-to-back shellackings \u2014 first against a nearly unknown first-term U.S. senator , then to a highly unpopular president \u2014 the party has no choice but to go in a new direction , and that path does not lead back into the wilderness .\nThe New Breed were on hand Saturday at the Iowa Freedom Summit , the first showcase for those who hope to move into the White House on Jan. 20 , 2017 . None was more highly anticipated than Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , who with his tax-slashing , union-bashing swagger has quickly become the new darling of conservatives .\nIn a 20-minute , stage-pacing speech , Mr. Walker wowed the heartland crowd . In what was mostly an introduction to voters who \u2019 ve never heard of him , the governor opened with his travails during a statewide recall vote , when his family faced threats and one anonymous opponent vowed to \u201c gut my wife like a deer . \u201d\n\u201c Since I was elected governor , we \u2019 ve cut taxes in Wisconsin , we \u2019 ve reduced spending , we balanced the budget , we took the power away from the big-government special interests and we put it firmly in the hands of the hard-working taxpayers . That \u2019 s what we need more of in this great country . And you know what , the liberals don \u2019 t much like that , \u201d he said to loud applause .\nMr. Walker , who looked less than polished , at one point talking over the applauding audience , told folksy stories about working at McDonald \u2019 s as a kid , shopping at Kohl \u2019 s . But his bootstrap message resonated with attendees , who heartily cheered when he said : \u201c The measure of success in government is how many people are no longer dependent on the government . \u201d\nAnother new face on big stage belonged to Ben Carson , who famously spanked President Obama over his health care overhaul during the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast . He , too , sought to introduce himself to voters , referring often to his hard-working mom who took no guff from her rambunctious boys .\nThe world-famous surgeon also talked God , a big topic in Iowa : \u201c You don \u2019 t have to have a PhD to talk to Him , you just have to have faith. \u201d He vowed that as president , he would have a secure southern border within one year , and pledged to reduce the size of government so \u201c they don \u2019 t have time to stick their big noses in everybody \u2019 s business. \u201d The crowd whooped at that line .\nCarly Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard , also debuted , and delivered several spectacular lines , none better than this aimed at a certain Democratic former secretary of state : \u201c Like Hillary Clinton , I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe .
