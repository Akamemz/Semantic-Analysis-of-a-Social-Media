It \u2019 s depressing . It \u2019 s all about people killing each other . \u201d\nGood point , Madame Realtor .

Petitions are being circulated . Proponents are all over the tube and the internet . It \u2019 s almost unbelievable , and yet it \u2019 s also fascinating , in a macabre way .\nThis idea that a state could secede was what led South Carolina to proclaim secession as soon as Lincoln was elected in 1860 . In short order , South Carolina was joined in this strange idea by Alabama , Mississippi , Georgia , Louisiana , Texas , Florida , Arkansas , Tennessee , North Carolina , and Virginia .\nIf it had not been for Lincoln \u2019 s arresting state officials , Kentucky and Maryland would have seceded , too , and that would have been the end of the USA as we know it .\nThe amazing thing is that there is nothing in the Constitution forbidding secession . Plus , there has never been a Supreme Court case saying secession is illegal . Look for it . Go ahead . You won \u2019 t find it .\nBut the will of the people is that we stay together as a union . And it was that will , greatly compounded by the wish of many to end slavery , that led to the bloodiest war in U.S. history : the war between the states or , as it \u2019 s better known , The Civil War . More than 600,000 men died to keep the union together and to free the slaves .\nDo the morons who are proposing secession here in Sunny Cal have any idea of just how serious a matter this is ? Obviously , there is no issue on the table remotely as morally compelling as ending slavery . Slavery was a hideous institution , but the southerners , or some of them , were willing to fight for it . Northerners \u2014 or some of them \u2014 were willing to fight to free the slaves . Virtually an entire generation of young men were wiped out as the consequence .\nWhat is even remotely worth even the possibility of fighting another civil war ? We already have legalized pot .
