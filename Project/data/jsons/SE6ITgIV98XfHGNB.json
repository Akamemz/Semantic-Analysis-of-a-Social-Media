Ossoff was the best recruit Democrats had available in the district , but a guy with no elective experience whose house lies just outside the district boundaries is hardly an ideal candidate .\nTo win in 2018 , Democrats will have to find opportunities to do better , but it \u2019 s certainly an achievable goal . The fact that the district was competitive is a sign that the GOP majority is at risk ; the question is simply what can Democrats do to put themselves over the top ?\nOne thing they might want to try is developing a substantive policy agenda to run on .

Instead , her campaign and its allies buried Ossoff under a pile of what basically amounts to nonsense \u2014 stuff about Kathy Griffin , stuff about Samuel L.

And the stuff that wasn \u2019 t unfair \u2014 like the location of his home \u2014 is honestly pretty silly .
