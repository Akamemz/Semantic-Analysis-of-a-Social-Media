When the rules were altered last August , decoupling the caucus from the process of awarding delegates , it was done with the intent of preventing another victory by an outsider \u2014 not just Trump but Cruz , Rand Paul , Ben Carson , and so on . The hope , I \u2019 m sure , was that an establishment champion would emerge this year and would , by dint of his greater campaign resources and \u201c insider \u201d support , \u201d be able to out-organize all of the insurgent candidates in electing delegates directly . Trump \u2019 s not wrong , in other words , to believe that the system was \u201c rigged , \u201d but it was rigged to try to hurt Cruz as much as to hurt him . So what happened ?

As the establishment candidates crumbled , Cruz got organized to target delegates at the state and district level while Trump glided on with his media-saturation campaign strategy .
