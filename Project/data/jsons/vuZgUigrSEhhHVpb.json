    "content": "For a few weeks in the summer , before it became clear that Donald Trump was here to stay , Carly Fiorina was the surprise rising star of the Republican primary .\nBut by the fall , her star faded . Fiorina never did better than third place in the national polling average , and by January , she was n't even on the main debate stage .\nAfter getting 4 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary and less than 2 percent in Iowa , Fiorina announced Wednesday she was dropping out of the race .\nIn her statement announcing she 'd end her campaign , Fiorina offered her own definition of feminism , and a subtle shot at Hillary Clinton :\nTo young girls and women across the country , I say : do not let others define you . Do not listen to anyone who says you have to vote a certain way or for a certain candidate because you 're a woman . That is not feminism . Feminism does n't shut down conversations or threaten women . It is not about ideology . It is not a weapon to wield against your political opponent . A feminist is a woman who lives the life she chooses and uses all her God-given gifts . And always remember that a leader is not born , but made . Choose leadership .\nFew thought Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard whose previous political experience consisted of a losing bid for a Senate seat in 2010 , would be the next president . Her biggest moment in the primary came when she played the role of the anti-Trump \u2014 someone with business acumen and private-sector experience , without the bombast and sexism .\nWhen Fiorina declared her candidacy in May , her biggest challenge seemed to be that she was an outsider without much political experience . She tried to turn this into a strength , saying she was `` outside the professional politician class . '' The rise of Trump shows that this might not have been as big a handicap as the conventional wisdom thought .\nBut after she announced , Fiorina stagnated in the polls until the first Republican debate . She was n't polling well enough to make the main event , but she dominated the undercard debate with fluent , precise answers and some good jabs at Trump . By the end of the night , she had more Google searches than he did .\nFrom there , Fiorina carved out a niche for herself , appealing to voters who wanted some of Trump 's traits \u2014 a business executive without a lot of political experience \u2014 without all the Trump trappings .\nWhere Trump blustered , Fiorina rattled off facts and figures . Where he turned to insults , she drew on specifics .

In an interview with Rolling Stone published in September , Trump criticized Fiorina 's appearance , saying , `` Look at that face \u2014 would anyone vote for that ?
