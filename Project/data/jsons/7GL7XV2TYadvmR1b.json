    "content": "President Trump took a victory lap on the economy Tuesday night in his first State of the Union address , declaring that his tax cuts have sparked an American revival , and reaching out to Democrats to work on problems from immigration to infrastructure .\n\u201c This is our new American moment , \u201d Mr. Trump told Congress in a prime-time address . \u201c There has never been a better time to start living the American dream . \u201d\nAfter a turbulent first year in which he often clashed with congressional Democrats , Mr. Trump appealed to liberal lawmakers to compromise on issues such as his major proposal on immigration and border security \u2014 providing a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrant \u201c Dreamers , \u201d spending $ 25 billion to build a border wall and enacting other immigration restrictions .\nFailure to reach a deal could prompt a partial government shutdown next week .\n\u201c Struggling communities , especially immigrant communities , will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c So tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties , Democrats and Republicans , to protect our citizens , of every background , color , and creed . \u201d\nThe president also announced he has signed an executive order that will keep open the high-security military detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba \u2014 reversing a decision by President Barack Obama in 2009 to close the prison . Gitmo is still open , with 41 alleged terrorist detainees , because Congress refused to go along with Mr. Obama \u2019 s order .\nAs part of that order , Mr. Trump said he is directing Defense Secretary James Mattis to reexamine U.S. military detention policy .\nIn a long-awaited move , Mr. Trump outlined a $ 1.5 trillion plan to rebuild the nation \u2019 s crumbling bridges and roads , using $ 200 billion in federal spending over a decade to spur more funding from state and local governments and private enterprise .\n\u201c I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe , fast , reliable , and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve , \u201d the president said .\nAides said Mr. Trump wanted to \u201c speak from the heart \u201d about his vision for a thriving economy lifting up all citizens . Earlier in the day , the president told journalists at the White House that he would consider it \u201c a great achievement \u2026 if I could unite the country , \u201d after decades of increasing partisan polarization in Washington .\nAt least 14 House Democrats , including members of the Congressional Black Caucus , boycotted the president \u2019 s address . Democrats invited about 20 illegal immigrants known as \u201c Dreamers \u201d to attend the speech , prompting an objection from a Republican lawmaker who said Capitol police should check IDs and arrest anyone in the U.S. illegally .\nAs Mr. Trump strode to the Speaker \u2019 s rostrum , he was in a position that any president would relish : riding a strong economy that he credited to his slashing of regulations and taxes . And the full impact of his tax cuts is about to show up in workers \u2019 paychecks over the next few weeks .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s address underscored the importance of the economy for his party , and for him , in this critical mid-term election year . The president \u2019 s job-approval ratings are still relatively weak ( 38 percent in Gallup , 43 percent in Rasmussen ) , although voters give him higher marks for his handling of the economy .\nSeated in the gallery with first lady Melania Trump were 14 guests of the White House to help illustrate the president \u2019 s themes , including a couple who adopted a child suffering from opioid addiction , and parents of two girls who were murdered by MS-13 , the notorious Central American gang that is increasing its U.S. presence because of immigration from its native lands .\nThe president , with a less combative tone than he often takes on social media , told Congress that he wanted to discuss \u201c what kind of future we are going to have , and what kind of nation we are going to be \u2014 all of us , together , as one team , one people , and one American family . \u201d\n\u201c Americans love their country , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c And they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return . \u201d\nBut the president \u2019 s agenda this year \u2014 reforming the immigration system , rebuilding infrastructure and beefing up the military \u2014 will be complicated by hardening of partisan lines ahead of the mid-terms .\nOn North Korea , Mr. Trump offered no new prescriptions for the regime of Kim Jong Un and its nuclear weapons . He said North Korea \u2019 s \u201c reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland , \u201d and vowed to continue a campaign of \u201c maximum pressure to prevent that from happening. \u201d The White House invited three guests connected with North Korea \u2014 Fred and Cindy Warmbier of Ohio , whose son Otto died after being severely injured in custody while studying in that country .\nAlso in attendance was Ji Seong-ho , who escaped North Korea as a starving boy decades ago .\n\u201c We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nOn Iran , Mr. Trump reiterated that he is asking the Congress to address \u201c fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. \u201d The president said the threats from rogue regimes , terrorist groups , and rivals such as China and Russia demonstrate the need for a stronger military . He called for an end to the \u201c dangerous defense sequester \u201d of funds and more money to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal .\n\u201c In confronting these dangers , we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict , and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense , \u201d he said . \u201c As part of our defense , we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal , hopefully never having to use it , but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons . Unfortunately , we are not there yet . \u201d\nBuilding on a move he made at the Department of Veterans Affairs last year , the president called on Congress to \u201c empower every Cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers \u2014 and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people . \u201d\nMr. Trump also spoke of more funding for vocational training and to reform prisons , although he offered no specifics .\nIn summing up his first year in office , Mr. Trump told Congress , \u201c The State of our Union is strong because our people are strong . \u201d\nThe president said of terrorists , \u201c When possible , we annihilate them . When necessary , we must be able to detain and question them . But we must be clear : Terrorists are not merely criminals . They are unlawful enemy combatants . And when captured overseas , they should be treated like the terrorists they are . \u201d\nPreviously , Mr. Trump said , \u201c we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists , only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2014 including the ISIS leader , al-Baghdadi . \u201d\nHe said Congress must provide \u201c all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down . \u201d",
