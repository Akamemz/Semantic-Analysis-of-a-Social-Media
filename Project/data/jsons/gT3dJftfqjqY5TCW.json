Now , there 's another word activists are hoping to banish from public discussion : `` illegal , '' as in `` illegal immigrant . ''\nSo far , the campaign to `` Drop the I-Word '' has had limited success , but that could change with immigration overhaul high on the president 's to-do list and with both sides plotting strategies and how to get their point across .\nOpponents of the term `` illegal immigrant '' find various things wrong with it : They say it 's technically wrong , offensive and is used to apply to people who may not even want to stay in the United States permanently , so they 're not true immigrants .\nThe term is an oxymoron , said Jonathan Rosa , an assistant professor of linguistic anthropology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .\n`` It is n't a legal concept , which is why you do n't hear judges and lawyers using this terminology in the law . The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act defines immigrants as people who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence , '' said Rosa . `` There 's no such thing as an 'illegal immigrant , ' because if you are an immigrant , you 're already legal . ''\nBut the issue is much more than grammatical . As in all arguments , the very words we choose can have an impact .

''\nJournalist turned immigrant activist Jose Antonio Vargas , a supporter of the Drop the I-Word campaign , argues that using the term `` illegal immigrant '' to describe people is a racially charged tactic that skews the immigration debate and fuels hate and violence .\nVargas , who was sent from the Philippines as a child to join his grandparents in California , said at a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on immigration how he felt when he was called `` illegal . ''\n`` I am the only one in my extended family of 25 Americans who is undocumented , '' he said . `` When you inaccurately call me 'illegal , ' you 're not only dehumanizing me , you 're offending them . No human being is illegal . ''\nThe argument is that the word `` illegal '' becomes dehumanizing when it brands an entire person , rather than an action they have taken . Opponents prefer a more specific word like `` undocumented '' be applied if it 's needed at all .\nCNN contributor Charles Garcia summed up his view in a column last year : `` In this country , there is still a presumption of innocence that requires a jury to convict someone of a crime .
