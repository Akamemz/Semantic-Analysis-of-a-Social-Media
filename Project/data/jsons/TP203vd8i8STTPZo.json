Lucille Roybal-Allard was tapped Wednesday to manage for House Democrats the annual Homeland Security budget bill \u2014 a decision that gives Latino voters a human face and voice at the bargaining table as never before in Congress .\nRoybal-Allard \u2019 s selection , approved by her fellow Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee , must still be ratified by the party \u2019 s leadership and full caucus . But as the first Latino to hold this post , her approval is certain and she represents a powerful historic symbol at a time when the same bill is caught in a bitter fight over immigration policy between Republicans and President Barack Obama .\nA veteran lawmaker in her own right , Roybal-Allard is the daughter of the late Rep. Edward Roybal , who preceded her in the House and was one of the founders of the Hispanic Caucus . More important perhaps , she brings to the table the credentials of a Mexican-American mother and grandmother whose focus is on the children left behind when their parents are deported .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a huge part for me because \u2026 a large percentage of these children are American citizens who end up in foster care and lose their parents , \u201d Roybal-Allard said in a brief hallway interview . \u201c And so that is going to definitely be a focus of mine , not just in terms of children but as much as possible , holding families together . \u201d\nThese same tensions are very much part of the partisan fight now over Obama \u2019 s executive order in November that temporarily lifted the threat of deportation from millions of undocumented workers and promised them permits this summer to gain legal employment .\nThe president would argue that this is within his discretion and a humane way to deal with the families , many of whom have been in the U.S. for years . Republicans counter that it is a gross overreach under the Constitution and have seized the Homeland bill as a vehicle with which to deny funding to implement Obama \u2019 s order .\nA debate in the House Appropriations Committee last June was very much a prelude to this battle \u2014 only then Democrats wanted to deny funding for the deportations .

Because their parents are being deported , right now we have approximately 5,000 American children who are currently in the child welfare system because of the deportation of a parent .
