J.B. Pritzker ( D ) . ( Jeff Roberson/AP )\nThe disparate responses to the coronavirus have focused attention on this reality . \u201c The states have drifted into different camps where the nature of their role in the federal system has increasingly differed and the nature of the government we get depends on where we live , \u201d said Donald F. Kettl , a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and author of \u201c The Divided States of America : Why Federalism Doesn \u2019 t Work . \u201d\nGary Gerstle , a professor of history at Cambridge University in England and author of \u201c Liberty and Coercion : The Paradox of American Government , \u201d noted that states started out with broad powers to regulate virtually all activity within their borders .\nStates exercised their authority through what is known as police power \u2014 though not to be confused with a definition that focuses only on law and order . Instead , this concept of police power derives from English doctrine and practice . This gave states responsibilities over health , safety , welfare and morals within their boundaries , everything from the regulation of businesses to Sunday blue laws to dealing with disasters and epidemics .\n\u201c The police power endows the states with an extraordinary authority to act on almost any issue having to do with the people \u2019 s welfare for the good of the commonwealth , \u201d Gerstle said . \u201c If that means overriding individual choice and individual rights , so be it . \u201d\nAs the nation matured , state powers were steadily chipped away by Congress and the Supreme Court . The vehicle used most frequently by the high court to give Washington ever-greater power was the Constitution \u2019 s commerce clause \u2014 which grants the federal government power to regulate commerce among the states .\nTimes of crisis often enhanced federal power . President Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2019 s response to the Great Depression resulted in the creation of the modern and more powerful national government . \u201c The 20th century is the story of the New Deal and the 1930s reshaping everything about federalism , \u201d LaCroix said in a recent interview . \u201c The expansion of the federal commerce power keeps continuing . The scope keeps growing . \u201d\nThe civil rights movement of the 1960s proved to be another watershed moment in giving the federal government greater power over the states . The 1964 Civil Rights Act was the cornerstone of the shift , and when the high court ruled unanimously that the act was constitutional , the justices used the commerce clause , rather than the 14th Amendment , to uphold it .\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw some shift back , as the Rehnquist court sought to prevent continuing erosion . But those changes still left the federal government with significantly more power . \u201c It turned out to be a lopsided game , \u201d Leavitt said of the long struggle between Washington and the states . \u201c States have often been politically anemic in defense of their role . \u201d\nAt the April 19 daily briefing by the coronavirus task force , Trump shows video of New York Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo ( D ) thanking his administration for its assistance to New York in managing the health crisis . ( Bill O \u2019 Leary/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nStates became more dependent on the federal government and more under Washington \u2019 s thumb as the price for greater financial support . But governors learned this spring that the existing relationship was inadequate to meet the moment . Because of hesitation by the president , they had to act on their own , and those unilateral decisions put them in the spotlight as well as the hot seat .\nOhio \u2019 s Mike DeWine ( R ) was the first governor in the nation to close schools . Even earlier , before there were any confirmed cases of covid-19 in his state , he prohibited spectator attendance at a popular annual bodybuilding festival .\nDisregarding a court decision that went against him , DeWine controversially postponed the state \u2019 s presidential primary on the eve of voting . He had hoped the courts would order the primary delayed , but his strategy of employing a friendly lawsuit to bring about the desired judicial ruling backfired .\n\u201c We pulled a judge who didn \u2019 t agree , \u201d DeWine said . \u201c It \u2019 s the luck of the draw . So at that point , I instructed my health director to issue a health order and that \u2019 s what she did . . . . It was a life-and-death issue . \u201d\nPritzker was the second governor to order residents to stay at home , acting shortly after California Gov . Gavin Newsom ( D ) and a little ahead of New York Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo ( D ) . Within a 24-hour period , the actions of those three governors put roughly 70 million Americans under orders to stay at home , with only a few exceptions .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201c was issuing guidance , but there was no leadership from Washington , \u201d Pritzker said . \u201c Is it hard to do ? Sure . But it \u2019 s part of the job . That \u2019 s what leadership is . Leadership is stepping out front and showing people the direction they need to go that they don \u2019 t necessarily understand or agree with . \u201d\nCuomo saw his state become the center of the pandemic , with more than 316,000 cases and more than 24,000 deaths . His daily news conferences became must-watch television , with a governor never known for his likability projecting empathy and realism while repeatedly challenging Washington to do more .\nThe briefings provided a contrast with Trump \u2019 s often-contentious daily sessions in the White House . Responding to Cuomo , Trump argued that New York did not need all it was asking for and that the federal government supplied New York with everything it did need and more .\nMaryland Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) , left , at an April 22 news conference at Laurel Medical Center in Laurel , Md . ( Salwan Georges/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nAs chairman of the National Governors Association , Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) has had to delicately navigate the relationship between the White House and his state , and the relationship between Washington and the governors collectively .\nIn his public comments about the relationship , Hogan has chosen his words diplomatically but has not hesitated to chart his own course . He shut down his state early \u2014 closing schools almost at the same time as Ohio did \u2014 and has made clear his differences with the president when he judged that events required doing so .\n\u201c The crisis demanded leadership and demanded action , \u201d he said . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t a time to debate federalism and philosophy , arguing about what powers should rest with the federal government or the state or Congress .\nTrump berated governors who criticized him . Governors learned that showing gratitude and praising the president were the price for federal cooperation and aid . Trump was particularly nasty toward Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer ( D ) when she expressed frustration with Washington . He tweeted that Whitmer was \u201c in way over her head , she doesn \u2019 t have a clue . \u201d\nWashington Gov . Jay Inslee ( D ) found himself as the first governor on the front lines when the virus began to savage a nursing home in the Seattle area . In pointed language , he begged for help from Washington . Trump called him \u201c a snake \u201d and suggested that Vice President Pence , a former governor of Indiana who chairs the White House coronavirus task force , stop dealing with Inslee .\n\u201c I hope this makes it into the story , \u201d Inslee said . \u201c The vice president has been continually helpful to us . He talks to us regularly . He has tried to ameliorate some of these problems . He has tried to remove some of the organizational underbrush . We have appreciated his efforts on this . \u201d\nWhy was the relationship so bumpy ? \u201c Well , to be gracious , part of it is the fog of war , \u201d Inslee said . \u201c It \u2019 s people having to do 50 things in five minutes . . . . But it is no secret that the president did not have the intense focus he needed in the first month of this . \u201d\nTrump participates in a teleconference with governors from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington on March 19 . ( Evan Vucci/AP )\nGovernors have been in regular contact with the administration . Hogan said there have been nearly a dozen conference calls between the governors and Pence \u2019 s task force , calls that sometimes include the president .\nThey are freewheeling and helpful , he said . But he acknowledged that there have been \u201c rough patches \u201d where things \u201c went off the rails. \u201d He attributed that to mixed messaging from the White House and to the extraordinary nature of the pandemic .\n\u201c There is tension between what the role of the federal government should be and what are the roles of the states , \u201d he added . \u201c It \u2019 s an unprecedented crisis that no one has ever faced before . . . . The federal government was not prepared . States were not prepared . Hospitals were not prepared . Manufacturers were not prepared . \u201d\nTrump has lacked consistency in describing the federal government \u2019 s responsibilities . When governors were pleading for medical equipment and supplies weeks ago , Trump encouraged them to act on their own . \u201c The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping , \u201d he said . \u201c You know , we \u2019 re not a shipping clerk . \u201d\nJeh Johnson , the secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama , said Trump had it backward . \u201c He says he \u2019 s not a shipping clerk . Well , actually , he \u2019 s the shipping clerk in chief , \u201d Johnson said .\nThe lack of preparedness and organization in Washington prompted governors to fend for themselves . Hogan , with the help of his Korean American wife Yumi Hogan , recently acquired 500,000 coronavirus test kits from South Korea . Massachusetts Gov . Charlie Baker ( R ) , frustrated by obstacles thrown up by the federal government , was able to acquire 1.2 million N95 masks from China and had them flown to Boston on the airplane of the New England Patriots .\nThe Ohio company Battelle developed a process to sanitize N95 masks that allowed the masks to be used many times over , but company officials were having difficulty getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration . One Sunday morning , a frustrated DeWine called the White House and left a message on the switchboard , appealing for help . Later that day , the president called back \u201c and it got moving , \u201d he said . \u201c It still had to go through the process , but it compressed the time . \u201d\nMassachusetts Gov . Charlie Baker ( R ) at Logan Airport on April 2 after a plane owned by the New England Patriots arrived with a shipment of 1.2 million N95 masks from China for use in Massachusetts and New York . ( Jim Davis/Pool/Reuters )\nIllinois \u2019 Pritzker was asked whether his public criticism of the White House had put his state at a disadvantage in getting supplies . \u201c Every time I \u2019 ve been outspoken about something we needed , I \u2019 ve begun to receive calls from the White House and administration officials to try to help us out , \u201d he said , adding he still hasn \u2019 t received everything he \u2019 s requested .\nTensions and frustrations continue . In March , as complaints about the federal government \u2019 s response mounted , Trump said , \u201c I don \u2019 t take any responsibility at all. \u201d He blamed others , including the Obama administration , for some of the shortages of tests and equipment .\nMore recently , the president claimed , with no basis in fact , that his \u201c authority is total \u201d to deal with the crisis , particularly on the timing for lifting state-ordered restrictions . The next day he backed down , acknowledging to governors in a conference call that the authority to make the decisions was theirs .\nTo Trump \u2019 s critics , that reversal was seen as another effort on his part to avoid responsibility , should things go wrong . \u201c His idea of federalism is when it \u2019 s all going well , it \u2019 s us . When [ it ] hits the fan , it \u2019 s you , \u201d said Michael Nutter , a former Democratic mayor of Philadelphia .\nTesting remains a point of contention . Governors have contradicted the White House repeatedly on the availability of tests , which will be needed in huge numbers as businesses begin to reopen and people leave their homes . \u201c It was a terrible crisis , \u201d Hogan said of the shortage of tests . \u201c It \u2019 s now better . But it \u2019 s not even close to where it needs to be . \u201d\nGovernors have begun to work together through their joint conference calls and by forming regional alliances to coordinate when to lift restrictions . They have sought to project a united front when dealing with the administration . But the debate over the reopening of the economy has created divisions among them .\nGeorgia Gov . Brian Kemp ( R ) is turning his state into a laboratory with his decision to start opening businesses , including barber shops , nail salons , tattoo parlors , movie theaters and restaurants , more rapidly than other states , despite warnings that he is putting people at risk of the virus spreading .\nIf Kemp thought he would earn plaudits from a president who has been eager to restart the economy , he was wrong . Trump , in another whiplash moment , said last week that he took issue with the governor \u2019 s plan . \u201c I told the governor very simply that I disagree with his decision , but he has to do what he thinks is right , \u201d Trump said .\nGovernors have been making hard decisions for weeks , but equally difficult ones lie ahead . Up to now , governors who ordered the most stringent restrictions on their populations won praise and earned higher approval ratings . But the debate over reopening economies has put the trade-offs involved in those decisions at the forefront of a growing debate .\n\u201c There \u2019 s the old saying that war \u2019 s too important to be left to the generals , \u201d said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. , a former governor of Indiana and now president of Purdue University . \u201c Everyone is using the war analogy for this . Then it \u2019 s too important to be left entirely to the epidemiologists . . . . The trade-off problem is front and center . It took a while , but that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re grappling with . \u201d\nAn image of a wax figure of Trump in the window of Madame Tussauds in Washington on April 28 . ( Matt McClain/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nState leaders have exercised their powers often to the fullest , but those powers still are limited . That has focused more attention on , and prompted considerable criticism of , the failure of the administration to exercise the federal government \u2019 s full powers .\nTrump has complained that the federal stockpiles he inherited were inadequate to meet the pandemic \u2019 s demands . But Lisa Monaco , White House homeland security adviser under Obama , said those stockpiles were meant only to be a bridge . \u201c It was always envisioned that [ during a pandemic ] , the federal government would step in and activate the supply chain and manufacturing , \u201d she said .\nOnly the federal government can use its convening authority and the Defense Production Act to set priorities and make a market for needed resources \u2014 and at a scale and a speed that a crisis demands . As Texas law professor Chesney explained , the federal government can compel industries to act in ways no state can do .\n\u201c [ The president ] can say the United States is purchaser number one , \u201d Chesney said . \u201c Let \u2019 s say the net amount of need is 100 masks . He can say the government will buy 100 masks and here \u2019 s what we \u2019 re going to pay for them and we \u2019 ll take possession on such and such a date . \u201d\nLeavitt said that in a pandemic , the federal government should focus as well on other things that states can not do , such as stabilizing the economy , marshaling the development and distribution of a vaccine , becoming the clearing house for information and managing relations with other countries .\nHe said Washington also should coordinate among the states and supplement supplies as much as possible , but added that on this issue , no level of government comes off clean . \u201c Emergency planners at every level have been aware for decades that we didn \u2019 t have a sufficient supply of ventilators , \u201d he said . \u201c There is plenty of blame to go around . \u201d\nTrump and Louisiana Gov . John Bel Edwards ( D ) meet in the Oval Office on April 29 . ( Doug Mills/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock )\nStates have seen their own budgets hemorrhaging money because of the crisis , and governors are looking to Washington for financial relief . \u201c As a governor , what you \u2019 re always hoping for from this kind of disaster is that you make all the decisions and have the feds pay for it , \u201d said former New Jersey governor Chris Christie ( R ) . \u201c I \u2019 ve told the White House this . You can print money and they can \u2019 t . \u201d\nBut Christie said this shouldn \u2019 t mean a blank check for the states . \u201c Governors have to be held to account for also making some sacrifices and cutting spending in other areas that are not directly related to support for the covid-19 crisis , \u201d he added . \u201c Governors can not be left with no hard choices . \u201d\nHow this crisis will reshape relations between the states and the federal government already is on the minds of governors and others , who see it as a moment that could revive states in the public \u2019 s mind . States have formed regional groups , and some governors say that they are more likely to take steps to prepare and protect their states against a future pandemic , rather than just counting on Washington to be ready .\nJanet Napolitano , a former governor of Arizona and secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration , said the relationship between Washington and the states in times of crisis should be like a smoothly running automobile . \u201c The four wheels of a car need to spin in the same direction at the same time , \u201d she said , something no one thinks has been the case in this battle .\nDaniels said the pandemic has shown the vibrancy of federalism but nonetheless could end as another crisis that enlarges the federal government . \u201c This [ virus ] thing does not manifest itself in the same way everywhere , and that \u2019 s an argument for a strong federal system and federal assistance that doesn \u2019 t try to proscribe every detail and constrain local responsiveness , \u201d he said .\n\u201c On the other side , \u201d he added , \u201c as people have been observing , wars have tended to centralize power and lead to bigger central government that never quite goes back to the size it was . \u201d\nHogan said this was no time for second-guessing the decisions that have been and are being made . In the meantime , he said , one thing seems clear : \u201c In the biggest crisis of our lifetimes , governors were on the front lines and taking charge . States had to make decisions and use their powers in a way I don \u2019 t ever remember in my lifetime . \u201d",

Instead, this concept of police power derives from English doctrine and practice. This gave states responsibilities over health, safety, welfare and morals within their boundaries, everything from the regulation of businesses to Sunday blue laws to dealing with disasters and epidemics.\n\n\u201cThe police power endows the states with an extraordinary authority to act on almost any issue having to do with the people\u2019s welfare for the good of the commonwealth,\u201d Gerstle said. \u201cIf that means overriding individual choice and individual rights, so be it.\u201d\n\nAs the nation matured, state powers were steadily chipped away by Congress and the Supreme Court. The vehicle used most frequently by the high court to give Washington ever-greater power was the Constitution\u2019s commerce clause \u2014 which grants the federal government power to regulate commerce among the states.\n\nTimes of crisis often enhanced federal power. President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s response to the Great Depression resulted in the creation of the modern and more powerful national government. \u201cThe 20th century is the story of the New Deal and the 1930s reshaping everything about federalism,\u201d LaCroix said in a recent interview. \u201cThe expansion of the federal commerce power keeps continuing. The scope keeps growing.\u201d\n\nThe civil rights movement of the 1960s proved to be another watershed moment in giving the federal government greater power over the states. The 1964 Civil Rights Act was the cornerstone of the shift, and when the high court ruled unanimously that the act was constitutional, the justices used the commerce clause, rather than the 14th Amendment, to uphold it.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw some shift back, as the Rehnquist court sought to prevent continuing erosion. But those changes still left the federal government with significantly more power. \u201cIt turned out to be a lopsided game,\u201d Leavitt said of the long struggle between Washington and the states. \u201cStates have often been politically anemic in defense of their role.\u201d\n\nAt the April 19 daily briefing by the coronavirus task force, Trump shows video of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) thanking his administration for its assistance to New York in managing the health crisis. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nGovernors step up\n\nStates became more dependent on the federal government and more under Washington\u2019s thumb as the price for greater financial support. But governors learned this spring that the existing relationship was inadequate to meet the moment. Because of hesitation by the president, they had to act on their own, and those unilateral decisions put them in the spotlight as well as the hot seat.\n\nOhio\u2019s Mike DeWine (R) was the first governor in the nation to close schools. Even earlier, before there were any confirmed cases of covid-19 in his state, he prohibited spectator attendance at a popular annual bodybuilding festival.\n\nDisregarding a court decision that went against him, DeWine controversially postponed the state\u2019s presidential primary on the eve of voting. He had hoped the courts would order the primary delayed, but his strategy of employing a friendly lawsuit to bring about the desired judicial ruling backfired.\n\n\u201cWe pulled a judge who didn\u2019t agree,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cIt\u2019s the luck of the draw. So at that point, I instructed my health director to issue a health order and that\u2019s what she did. . . . It was a life-and-death issue.\u201d\n\nPritzker was the second governor to order residents to stay at home, acting shortly after California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and a little ahead of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D). Within a 24-hour period, the actions of those three governors put roughly 70 million Americans under orders to stay at home, with only a few exceptions.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cwas issuing guidance, but there was no leadership from Washington,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cIs it hard to do? Sure. But it\u2019s part of the job. That\u2019s what leadership is. Leadership is stepping out front and showing people the direction they need to go that they don\u2019t necessarily understand or agree with.\u201d\n\nCuomo saw his state become the center of the pandemic, with more than 316,000 cases and more than 24,000 deaths. His daily news conferences became must-watch television, with a governor never known for his likability projecting empathy and realism while repeatedly challenging Washington to do more.\n\nThe briefings provided a contrast with Trump\u2019s often-contentious daily sessions in the White House. Responding to Cuomo, Trump argued that New York did not need all it was asking for and that the federal government supplied New York with everything it did need and more.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), left, at an April 22 news conference at Laurel Medical Center in Laurel, Md. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nAs chairman of the National Governors Association, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has had to delicately navigate the relationship between the White House and his state, and the relationship between Washington and the governors collectively.\n\nIn his public comments about the relationship, Hogan has chosen his words diplomatically but has not hesitated to chart his own course. He shut down his state early \u2014 closing schools almost at the same time as Ohio did \u2014 and has made clear his differences with the president when he judged that events required doing so.\n\n\u201cThe crisis demanded leadership and demanded action,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a time to debate federalism and philosophy, arguing about what powers should rest with the federal government or the state or Congress.\n\n\u201cEvery day we waited, people lost their lives.\u201d\n\n[Denial and dysfunction plagued federal response]\n\nTrump berated governors who criticized him. Governors learned that showing gratitude and praising the president were the price for federal cooperation and aid. Trump was particularly nasty toward Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) when she expressed frustration with Washington. He tweeted that Whitmer was \u201cin way over her head, she doesn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) found himself as the first governor on the front lines when the virus began to savage a nursing home in the Seattle area. In pointed language, he begged for help from Washington. Trump called him \u201ca snake\u201d and suggested that Vice President Pence, a former governor of Indiana who chairs the White House coronavirus task force, stop dealing with Inslee.\n\n\u201cI hope this makes it into the story,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cThe vice president has been continually helpful to us. He talks to us regularly. He has tried to ameliorate some of these problems. He has tried to remove some of the organizational underbrush. We have appreciated his efforts on this.\u201d\n\nWhy was the relationship so bumpy? \u201cWell, to be gracious, part of it is the fog of war,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cIt\u2019s people having to do 50 things in five minutes. . . . But it is no secret that the president did not have the intense focus he needed in the first month of this.\u201d\n\nTrump participates in a teleconference with governors from the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington on March 19. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nStates vs. Washington\n\nGovernors have been in regular contact with the administration. Hogan said there have been nearly a dozen conference calls between the governors and Pence\u2019s task force, calls that sometimes include the president.\n\nThey are freewheeling and helpful, he said. But he acknowledged that there have been \u201crough patches\u201d where things \u201cwent off the rails.\u201d He attributed that to mixed messaging from the White House and to the extraordinary nature of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere is tension between what the role of the federal government should be and what are the roles of the states,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented crisis that no one has ever faced before. . . . The federal government was not prepared. States were not prepared. Hospitals were not prepared. Manufacturers were not prepared.\u201d\n\nTrump has lacked consistency in describing the federal government\u2019s responsibilities. When governors were pleading for medical equipment and supplies weeks ago, Trump encouraged them to act on their own. \u201cThe federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re not a shipping clerk.\u201d\n\nJeh Johnson, the secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama, said Trump had it backward. \u201cHe says he\u2019s not a shipping clerk. Well, actually, he\u2019s the shipping clerk in chief,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe lack of preparedness and organization in Washington prompted governors to fend for themselves. Hogan, with the help of his Korean American wife Yumi Hogan, recently acquired 500,000 coronavirus test kits from South Korea. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R), frustrated by obstacles thrown up by the federal government, was able to acquire 1.2 million N95 masks from China and had them flown to Boston on the airplane of the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Ohio company Battelle developed a process to sanitize N95 masks that allowed the masks to be used many times over, but company officials were having difficulty getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration. One Sunday morning, a frustrated DeWine called the White House and left a message on the switchboard, appealing for help. Later that day, the president called back \u201cand it got moving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt still had to go through the process, but it compressed the time.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) at Logan Airport on April 2 after a plane owned by the New England Patriots arrived with a shipment of 1.2 million N95 masks from China for use in Massachusetts and New York. (Jim Davis/Pool/Reuters)\n\nIllinois\u2019 Pritzker was asked whether his public criticism of the White House had put his state at a disadvantage in getting supplies. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve been outspoken about something we needed, I\u2019ve begun to receive calls from the White House and administration officials to try to help us out,\u201d he said, adding he still hasn\u2019t received everything he\u2019s requested.\n\n[What we know about delays in testing]\n\nTensions and frustrations continue. In March, as complaints about the federal government\u2019s response mounted, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t take any responsibility at all.\u201d He blamed others, including the Obama administration, for some of the shortages of tests and equipment.\n\nMore recently, the president claimed, with no basis in fact, that his \u201cauthority is total\u201d to deal with the crisis, particularly on the timing for lifting state-ordered restrictions. The next day he backed down, acknowledging to governors in a conference call that the authority to make the decisions was theirs.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s critics, that reversal was seen as another effort on his part to avoid responsibility, should things go wrong. \u201cHis idea of federalism is when it\u2019s all going well, it\u2019s us. When [it] hits the fan, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Michael Nutter, a former Democratic mayor of Philadelphia.\n\nTesting remains a point of contention. Governors have contradicted the White House repeatedly on the availability of tests, which will be needed in huge numbers as businesses begin to reopen and people leave their homes. \u201cIt was a terrible crisis,\u201d Hogan said of the shortage of tests. \u201cIt\u2019s now better. But it\u2019s not even close to where it needs to be.\u201d\n\nGovernors have begun to work together through their joint conference calls and by forming regional alliances to coordinate when to lift restrictions. They have sought to project a united front when dealing with the administration. But the debate over the reopening of the economy has created divisions among them.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is turning his state into a laboratory with his decision to start opening businesses, including barber shops, nail salons, tattoo parlors, movie theaters and restaurants, more rapidly than other states, despite warnings that he is putting people at risk of the virus spreading.\n\nIf Kemp thought he would earn plaudits from a president who has been eager to restart the economy, he was wrong. Trump, in another whiplash moment, said last week that he took issue with the governor\u2019s plan. \u201cI told the governor very simply that I disagree with his decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right,\u201d Trump said.\n\nGovernors have been making hard decisions for weeks, but equally difficult ones lie ahead. Up to now, governors who ordered the most stringent restrictions on their populations won praise and earned higher approval ratings. But the debate over reopening economies has put the trade-offs involved in those decisions at the forefront of a growing debate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the old saying that war\u2019s too important to be left to the generals,\u201d said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., a former governor of Indiana and now president of Purdue University. \u201cEveryone is using the war analogy for this. Then it\u2019s too important to be left entirely to the epidemiologists. . . . The trade-off problem is front and center. It took a while, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re grappling with.\u201d\n\nAn image of a wax figure of Trump in the window of Madame Tussauds in Washington on April 28. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nUnmet demand for action\n\nState leaders have exercised their powers often to the fullest, but those powers still are limited. That has focused more attention on, and prompted considerable criticism of, the failure of the administration to exercise the federal government\u2019s full powers.\n\nTrump has complained that the federal stockpiles he inherited were inadequate to meet the pandemic\u2019s demands. But Lisa Monaco, White House homeland security adviser under Obama, said those stockpiles were meant only to be a bridge. \u201cIt was always envisioned that [during a pandemic], the federal government would step in and activate the supply chain and manufacturing,\u201d she said.\n\nOnly the federal government can use its convening authority and the Defense Production Act to set priorities and make a market for needed resources \u2014 and at a scale and a speed that a crisis demands. As Texas law professor Chesney explained, the federal government can compel industries to act in ways no state can do.\n\n\u201c[The president] can say the United States is purchaser number one,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cLet\u2019s say the net amount of need is 100 masks. He can say the government will buy 100 masks and here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to pay for them and we\u2019ll take possession on such and such a date.\u201d\n\nLeavitt said that in a pandemic, the federal government should focus as well on other things that states cannot do, such as stabilizing the economy, marshaling the development and distribution of a vaccine, becoming the clearing house for information and managing relations with other countries.\n\nHe said Washington also should coordinate among the states and supplement supplies as much as possible, but added that on this issue, no level of government comes off clean. \u201cEmergency planners at every level have been aware for decades that we didn\u2019t have a sufficient supply of ventilators,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is plenty of blame to go around.\u201d\n\nTrump and Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) meet in the Oval Office on April 29. (Doug Mills/Pool/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nStates have seen their own budgets hemorrhaging money because of the crisis, and governors are looking to Washington for financial relief. \u201cAs a governor, what you\u2019re always hoping for from this kind of disaster is that you make all the decisions and have the feds pay for it,\u201d said former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R). \u201cI\u2019ve told the White House this. You can print money and they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut Christie said this shouldn\u2019t mean a blank check for the states. \u201cGovernors have to be held to account for also making some sacrifices and cutting spending in other areas that are not directly related to support for the covid-19 crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cGovernors cannot be left with no hard choices.\u201d\n\nHow this crisis will reshape relations between the states and the federal government already is on the minds of governors and others, who see it as a moment that could revive states in the public\u2019s mind. States have formed regional groups, and some governors say that they are more likely to take steps to prepare and protect their states against a future pandemic, rather than just counting on Washington to be ready.\n\nJanet Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona and secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration, said the relationship between Washington and the states in times of crisis should be like a smoothly running automobile. \u201cThe four wheels of a car need to spin in the same direction at the same time,\u201d she said, something no one thinks has been the case in this battle.\n\nDaniels said the pandemic has shown the vibrancy of federalism but nonetheless could end as another crisis that enlarges the federal government. \u201cThis [virus] thing does not manifest itself in the same way everywhere, and that\u2019s an argument for a strong federal system and federal assistance that doesn\u2019t try to proscribe every detail and constrain local responsiveness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the other side,\u201d he added, \u201cas people have been observing, wars have tended to centralize power and lead to bigger central government that never quite goes back to the size it was.\u201d\n\nHogan said this was no time for second-guessing the decisions that have been and are being made. In the meantime, he said, one thing seems clear: \u201cIn the biggest crisis of our lifetimes, governors were on the front lines and taking charge. States had to make decisions and use their powers in a way I don\u2019t ever remember in my lifetime.\u201d",
