I am not the only person to have made such observations .\nOf course , Republicans and conservatives find these twin facts offensive and unbelievable . They hold onto their founding myth of Lincoln and \u201c Great Emancipator \u201d while simultaneously being dependent on voters from the former Confederacy for power\u2014states that still fly and honor the American swastika , a rebel flag of treason and anti-black hatred .\nThe ascendance of Donald Trump and his coronation as the presumed 2016 Republican presidential candidate is the logical outcome of a several decades-long pattern of racism , nativism , and bigotry by the American right-wing and its news entertainment disinformation machine .\nFor example , in response to the triumphs of the black freedom struggle and the civil rights movement , the Republican Party has relied on the much discussed \u201c Southern Strategy. \u201d Lee Atwater , master Republican strategist and mentor to Karl Rove explained this approach as :\nYou start out in 1954 by saying , \u201c N * * * * r , n * * * * r , n * * * * r. \u201d By 1968 you can \u2019 t say \u201c n * * * * r \u201d \u2014that hurts you , backfires .

Now , you \u2019 re talking about cutting taxes , and all these things you \u2019 re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is , blacks get hurt worse than whites.\u2026 \u201c We want to cut this , \u201d is much more abstract than even the busing thing , uh , and a hell of a lot more abstract than \u201c N * * * * r , n * * * * r . \u201d\nRonald Reagan and other Republican elites would leverage Atwater \u2019 s approach to winning white voters and elections .

In that speech , Reagan signaled to the ghosts of Jim and Jane Crow and the neo-Confederacy by stating his support for \u201c states \u2019 rights . \u201d\nReagan would continue to use overt and coded racial appeals to gin up white support through his references to a \u201c lazy , \u201d \u201c violent \u201d and \u201c parasitic \u201d class of black Americans who he described as \u201c welfare queens \u201d and \u201c strapping bucks. \u201d George Bush would continue with the Southern Strategy when he summoned up white racist stereotypes and fears of \u201c the black beast rapist \u201d in the form of Willie Horton during the 1988 presidential election .\nThe Age of Obama witnessed an explosion of anti-black racism by the Republican Party and conservatives en masse .
