Our brightest (if not always the best) are redeeming all that money their parents spent on tutors to read their application essays, having been coached about how to impress college interviewers with tales of adventure walking the Great Wall of China, writing avant-garde plays in Urdu, or explaining the importance of a gluten-free diet.\n\nThe Class of \u201817 is settling in seriously, many on posh campuses with luxurious gyms, huge playing fields and Olympic-size swimming pools.
