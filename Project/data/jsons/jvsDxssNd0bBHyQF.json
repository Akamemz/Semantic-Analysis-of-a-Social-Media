Anna Eshoo has dipped into her campaign fund to buy more than $ 2,000 in gifts for her good friend and fellow Californian , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , from swank stores such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman .\nRep. Henry Cuellar ( D-Texas ) has dropped nearly $ 3,400 in campaign cash servicing his BMW in Alexandria , Virginia .\nOther lawmakers have used their war chests for European travels , upgrade airline seats and access the American Airlines Admirals Club in airports across the country . In one case , a retired member of Congress with money left in his account used the cash to pay his wife roughly $ 20,000 since Election Day .\nDisgraced former Rep. Aaron Schock ( R-Ill. ) resigned after a firestorm of criticism over his use of campaign dollars to underwrite a lavish lifestyle , among other alleged misdeeds . But the truth is , while Schock was by all accounts an extreme case , he is far from the exception . It fact , elected officials routinely tap their campaign accounts to pay for things that appear to have little to do with seeking another term in Congress , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of campaign documents .\nIndeed , donor dollars can , at times , resemble a slush fund . And experts say the reason is because lawmakers have almost complete latitude to decide what constitutes a campaign expense .\n\u201c The House Ethics Committee typically gives ( members of Congress ) a wide berth in defining what is considered campaign or officially connected activities , \u201d said Kenneth Gross , a veteran ethics and election lawyer at Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom . \u201c However , under House and [ Federal Election Commission ] rules , personal use of campaign funds is strictly prohibited . \u201d\nIn the wake of revelations that Schock allegedly misrepresented his congressional expenses by tens of thousands of dollars , Michigan Republican Rep. Candice Miller \u2019 s House Administration Committee is reviewing internal procedures and controls on the spending of taxpayer dollars . A grand jury is currently hearing testimony related to Schock \u2019 s alleged misspending of taxpayer dollars .\nBut unlike official expenditures , campaign expenditures are barely monitored . Case in point : Schock publicly admitted to several errors on FEC reports and promised to file amendments . More than a month after resigning , the Illinois Republican still has not filed any corrected records .\nCongress ' petty cash problem Members of Congress have almost total discretion to determine what is a legitimate campaign expense . Here are some of the more unusual ways they have used donor dollars : Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D-Ca . ) : Gifts for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi from swank stores such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman , more than $ 2,000 . Rep. Bob Brady ( D-Pa. ) : Christmas gifts from Capital Grille , upwards of $ 10,000 per year . Rep. Henry Cuellar ( D-Texas ) : Servicing his BMW in Alexandria , Virginia , nearly $ 3,400 . Sen.

Gene Green ( D-Texas ) : Gifts for his D.C. and district staff , roughly $ 3,000 . Retired Rep. Buck McKeon ( R-Ca . ) : Money left in campaign post-retirement in January , $ 250,000 .\nPaying for gifts is one of the unique ways that members of Congress use their campaign accounts . Most corporations wouldn \u2019 t allow the boss to withdraw thousands of dollars from business coffers without any oversight to hand out cash gifts to employees , yet that \u2019 s essentially what Rep. Gene Green does . At the end of each year , the Texas Democrat takes roughly $ 3,000 from his reelection fund and gives each staffer in his Washington and district offices $ 200 as a holiday present .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t buy gifts , \u201d Green said . \u201c I give , typically , [ it ] started out at $ 100 and now I give the staff whether D.C. staff or district staff $ 200 at Christmas . \u201d\nDozens of members of Congress reward people who work on their reelection campaigns .\nRep. Robert Brady , a powerful Democrat from Philadelphia , shells out more than $ 10,000 every year at Capital Grille , buying Christmas gifts for campaign aides . He hasn \u2019 t won with less than 74 percent of the vote since he was first elected in 1998 .\n\u201c Since members run for reelection every two years , it \u2019 s important to say \u2018 thank you \u2019 to the men and women who volunteer so much of their time and energy to his campaigns , \u201d said Stanley V. White , Brady \u2019 s chief of staff . \u201c These gifts were for political activists and ward leaders who are integral to Congressman Brady \u2019 s reelection efforts . \u201d\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) has gone on a shopping spree at Vineyard Vines , the Connecticut-based preppy clothing company \u2014 to the tune of $ 12,295 in the past five months .

Why have I done that for the leader , amongst others ? No one has been more consistently thoughtful or actively supportive than she has been . I always think a \u2018 thank you \u2019 should be as memorable as the kindness that prompted it , and they carry memorable items . \u201d\nEshoo said she couldn \u2019 t recall what she has bought for Pelosi , but said she believes she \u2019 s given the Democratic leader scarves .\nOther lawmakers have tapped their campaign kitties to travel abroad .\nRepublican Rep. Louie Gohmert represents a district on the eastern border of Texas , but one of his campaign line items last year was $ 272 for a meeting room at the Intercontinental Victoria Island in Lagos , Nigeria .

He also spent time in Oxford at the Old Bank Hotel .\nGohmert \u2019 s spokesman , Kimberly Willingham , said Gohmert was giving political speeches in England , but did not respond to questions about whom Gohmert addressed . She suggested \u2588\u2588\u2588 write an \u201c unbiased article about a congressman saving taxpayers significant amounts of money by legally using funds he has raised instead of taxpayer funds . \u201d\nSen. John Cornyn , the No . 2 Senate Republican who is also from Texas , spent $ 336 for \u201c beverages for meal \u201d while on a congressional delegation trip to South Africa .
