''\nMinnesotans and Wisconsinites share a long-standing rivalry -- in politics , business , and , of course , on the football field .

Minnesota has its own online marketplace where residents and small businesses can shop for and buy insurance , while Wisconsin is relying on the federal government marketplace , which has been plagued with bugs and technical failures and does n't accommodate small businesses .\nIf and when the Obama administration fixes that , the rate differentials will remain . And they are stark .\nA 50-year-old Minnesotan who lives just south of the Twin Cities in Dakota County can buy a mid-level , silver plan for $ 241 a month . Just 20 miles away , across the state line in St. Croix County , the lowest cost silver plan available to a 50-year-old Wisconsinite costs nearly three times that price -- $ 622 a month .\nThe statewide average for such a plan in Minnesota is $ 304 , compared to $ 403 in Wisconsin , a Gannett analysis of federal and state data found . Those rates do not take into account the subsidies some lower-income consumers will receive .\nThe disparity carries through to younger consumers as well . Twenty-seven-year-olds living in Brown , Outagamie or Marathon counties , for example , have to pay roughly the statewide Wisconsin average of around $ 235 a month for the lowest cost mid-level plan . Over in Minnesota , individuals in their mid-20s can get those plans 36 percent cheaper for $ 150 on average .\nWisconsin 's rates are not just higher than Minnesota 's , they 're 21 percent higher than the average across 34 states for which the federal government released detailed premium data .\nWisconsin officials acknowledged the rate disparities but said they are confident insurance companies in the state are not overcharging consumers . Deputy Insurance Commissioner Dan Schwartzer pointed to a requirement under the health law that carriers spend 80 percent of premium revenue on medical claims . That limits overhead costs , including administration , salaries and profits , to 20 percent .\n`` When they submit rates , they know that they 've got to stay under the 20 percent cap or they 're going to have to refund it back , anyways , '' Schwartzer said in an interview .\nHe also said premiums have historically been higher in Wisconsin , pointing to a 2012 Health and Human Services Department study that showed private employers in the Badger State paid premiums that were 7 percent higher on average than in Minnesota .\nAnalysts say premiums are based on a number of factors , from health costs and demographics to market competitiveness . But when it comes to Wisconsin and Minnesota , none of those appears to account for such a wide disparity .\nThe nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that health care costs in the two states are roughly the same . Per capita expenditures were $ 7,409 in Minnesota versus $ 7,233 in Wisconsin , according to the most recent data released in 2011 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . And the costs have grown annually since 1991 at nearly the same rate -- 6.7 percent in Wisconsin and 7 percent in Minnesota .\nAs for competitiveness , there are only five insurers offering plans on the Minnesota exchange , while there are 13 carriers participating in the Wisconsin exchange .\nCynthia Cox , a policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation , said regulation also plays a role in premium levels .\nIn Minnesota , regulators forced insurers in several cases to resubmit lower rates because they questioned the justifications for them . In Wisconsin , regulators took a more hands-off approach and let all the rates go through as-is after reviewing carriers ' justifications .\nLiberal advocacy group Citizen Action Wisconsin pointed to another possible factor in a report it released a few weeks ago : Gov . Scott Walker 's decision not to expand Medicaid as much as other states and to transition some 77,000 people off Badgercare and force them to buy insurance on the federal exchange .\nThe group pointed to an analysis by the nonpartisan Rand Corporation that predicted failing to expand Medicaid would increase rates by 8 to 10 percent for insurance sold on individual exchanges . That 's because lower-income individuals tend to be less healthy -- with higher health care costs -- and forcing them onto the exchanges would make the pool of prospective insured less healthy , driving up premiums .\n`` The fundamental difference between the two states , which are similar geographically and demographically and have very similar underlying medical costs , is that Minnesota has embraced the national health care reform law and is using the tools it provides to deliver more affordable health insurance , while the Walker administration has tried to undermine the law at every turn , '' Citizen Action CEO Robert Kraig and researcher Kevin Kane wrote in a scathing op-ed recently .\nBut Schwartzer , the Wisconsin deputy insurance commissioner , dismissed that argument , said there is no evidence that the 77,000 individuals leaving Badgercare are unhealthy .\nAnd he said the state 's rate-review process was sound . Schwartzer said that actuaries reviewed the rates insurers submitted and did n't find any that appeared out of whack . And he said the Walker administration did n't see any point in brow-beating insurers into offering lower rates when market forces are in play .\n`` We let them beat each other up versus us beating the insurer up , '' he said . `` Let them beat each other up being competitive against each other . ''\nSchwartzer pointed to another potential factor in insurers setting higher rates in the state -- the dissolution of the state 's high-risk pool , where some 22,000 Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions and therefore higher health care costs had been getting insurance .\n`` From an insurer 's perspective , the other major factor , other than uninsured population would be those in the high risk pools going into the private market , '' Schwartzer said .\nOver in Minnesota , state officials are keeping their high-risk pool open for another year .\nMinnesota officials happily point to several other decisions they say resulted in low rates .

''\nMinnesota Commerce Department Spokeswoman Anne O'Connor also points to the rigorous review process that insurers had to go through before Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman approved plans offered on their exchange .\n`` In this case , the rates Commissioner Rothman approved for the 141 plans available through MNsure were 4 to 37 percent lower than had originally been filed , '' O'Connor said .\nThe White House is hoping that Wisconsin and other states will change their minds and join Minnesota in expanding Medicaid .
