Lest they be lost , here are some highly pertinent facts about the shutdown fight , and about Obamacare .\nFirst , fiscal conservatives in Congress want to fund the government \u2013 all of it \u2013 except for Obamacare . The House of Representatives , which takes the lead on budget and tax bills , has passed \u2013 several times now \u2013 legislation that would defund or eliminate portions of the widely unpopular health-care law , while fully funding all other federal operations .\nThe Senate , controlled by Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D ) of Nevada and the Democrats , has so far rejected the lower chamber \u2019 s attempts to keep money flowing to government operations . In case the Senate continues to rebuff these attempts , the House has taken the precaution of passing legislation ( which the Senate approved and President Obama signed into law last night ) that would ensure that our military personnel around the world will continue to receive their hard-earned pay during the shutdown .\nSecond , the Obama administration \u2019 s stated position for months amounts to agreeing to the shutdown of the government . The president \u2019 s advisers have publicly threatened to veto multiple House-passed spending bills . Those threats came because the president and his allies want to replace spending cuts already agreed to under the Budget Control Act with more tax increases . In other words , if Mr. Obama and Sen. Reid didn \u2019 t shut down the government to insist on funding Obamacare , they likely would have shut down the government to essentially insist on spending more .\nThird , while a \u201c government shutdown \u201d is an inconvenience to many Americans , the federal government never fully shuts down . The majority of the nation \u2019 s 2 million federal workers will likely not be furloughed . The military will continue to protect our shores , Social Security and Medicare checks will be processed as usual \u2013 and the Postal Service will remain open for business to deliver them . In many respects , the term \u201c shutdown \u201d is a misnomer ; the current situation is more like a slowdown of government services than a complete shutdown .\nIf that conflicts with the dire predictions you \u2019 ve heard about the \u201c disastrous \u201d consequences of a shutdown , consider this .
