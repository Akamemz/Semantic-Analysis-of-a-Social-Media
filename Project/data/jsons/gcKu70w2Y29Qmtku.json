Lobbyists for corporations and industry groups will now be allowed to serve on more than 1,000 industry boards , panels and commissions that give the private sector an advisory role in decision-making across the executive branch , according to a copy of the rule published on the Federal Register site . The new rule affects a policy implemented in June 2010 as part of President Barack Obama \u2019 s ethics package , but keeps some of the ban in place . Lobbyists will be allowed to serve only on commissions and boards in a \u201c representative \u201d capacity \u2014 so long as they \u2019 re acting on behalf of a corporation , trade association or industry group and not as private citizens or representatives of the government . -- The reversal comes amid ongoing debate over the effectiveness of Obama \u2019 s efforts to end K Street \u2019 s influence on policymaking .
