    "content": "It was a not-uncommon sentiment in the wake of last week \u2019 s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , in which 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed ( allegedly at the hands of white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. ) and far-right activists assaulted and intimidated counterprotesters .\nThe ACLU had sued the city of Charlottesville to allow the Unite the Right rally to happen downtown . And now , it had happened , and blood had been spilled .\nThe ACLU \u2019 s been through this cycle before . When the ACLU famously defended the rights of a Nazi group to march through a largely Jewish neighborhood in Skokie , Illinois , in the 1970s \u2014 a case that \u2019 s set the parameters of First Amendment protections for protests for the last 50 years \u2014 it lost thousands of members and faced bitter questions from liberal American Jews about how it could defend the group that had killed their relatives ( and in some cases tortured them ) just a few decades before .\nBut these aren \u2019 t the same Nazis who marched through Skokie , and this isn \u2019 t the same progressive movement \u2014 and it isn \u2019 t the same ACLU , either . The backlash has already spurred other ACLU chapters to declare that they don \u2019 t believe free-speech protections apply to events like the one in Charlottesville , and led the ACLU \u2019 s national director , Anthony Romero , to declare the group will no longer defend the right to protest when the protesters want to carry guns .\nThe ACLU \u2019 s response didn \u2019 t resolve the underlying problem . It didn \u2019 t fully address a criticism put forward everywhere from Twitter to the New York Times , which published a column from former ACLU volunteer K-Sue Park on Thursday called \u201c The ACLU Needs to Rethink Free Speech . \u201d\nAnd with city governments already moving to restrict future far-right rallies to prevent a recurrence of what happened in Charlottesville \u2014 the city of Berkeley just passed an emergency ordinance allowing the police to dissolve gatherings that don \u2019 t have permits , for example , in anticipation of a forthcoming \u201c alt-right \u201d rally there \u2014 the ACLU is going to have to make some very quick decisions about when and how it will defend the far right in 2017 .\nThe ACLU seemed like it was in the midst of a partial reinvention as an explicitly progressive organization for the Donald Trump era . It was one of the biggest beneficiaries from the # resistance groundswell of small donations and grassroots interest after the 2016 election , and it \u2019 s leaned into the idea of itself as a movement organization rather than just the country \u2019 s most powerful public-interest law firm .\nBut the Charlottesville rally called attention to an important fault line between the ACLU \u2019 s traditional vision of justice and the way the progressive grassroots movement sees justice in 2017 : a fight over whether the best way to protect the powerless is to stand against the principles that could be used to crush them , or simply to stand on the side of people seeking social equality by whatever means are necessary .\nThe ACLU \u2019 s new line post-Charlottesville : firearms and free speech don \u2019 t mix\nIn the days before the Unite the Right rally , it became clear that Charlottesville would be a gathering point for both right-wing rallygoers and left-wing counterprotesters . The city of Charlottesville attempted to defuse the situation by moving the Unite the Right rally away from its original location \u2014 Lee Square , in downtown Charlottesville , featuring the statue of Robert E. Lee that was the ostensible cause of the rally \u2014 to a location farther away from the center of the city .\nThe city argued it was trying to prevent confrontation . But to free-speech activists \u2014 including the ACLU of Virginia \u2014 it was a pretty standard attempt to use a rally permit to marginalize unpopular speech . So the organizers of the rally sued , with the ACLU \u2019 s support , and won the right to keep the rally downtown .\nYou know what happened next . The Unite the Right rally was disbanded before it had officially begun , after the hours before the rally were marked by clashes between rallygoers and counterprotesters . The bulk of the violence was initiated by rallygoers , and as counterprotesters marched down a street hours after the rally , a car ( allegedly driven by Fields , who had attended the rally carrying a shield with the logo of white-supremacist group Vanguard America ) killed Heyer and injured 19 other counterprotesters .\nAlmost immediately , some progressives began to ask why the ACLU had fought to allow this to happen . ACLU of Virginia board member Waldo Jaquith resigned , alleging on Twitter that the organization ignored signs that rally organizers were encouraging violence \u2014 and that \u201c what is legal is not always right . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s legal and what \u2019 s right are sometimes different . I won \u2019 t be a fig leaf for Nazis . \u2014 Waldo Jaquith ( @ waldojaquith ) August 13 , 2017\nWith more \u201c alt-right \u201d rallies planned for the weeks after Charlottesville , and mounting pressure on the ACLU to stop \u201c defending Nazis , \u201d the ACLU \u2019 s California affiliates issued a statement on Wednesday declaring , \u201c We review each request for help on a case-by-case basis , but take the clear position that the First Amendment does not protect people who incite or engage in violence . If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people , they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution . \u201d\nAt first , it seemed like the California affiliates were subtweeting , or even splitting with , their Virginia counterpart . But on Thursday , the national organization appeared to side with the Californians \u2014 and draw a new line that would have prevented them from defending Unite the Right . ACLU director Anthony Romero told the Wall Street Journal : \u201c If a protest group insists , \u2018 No , we want to be able to carry loaded firearms , \u2019 well , we don \u2019 t have to represent them . They can find someone else . \u201d\nThe ACLU \u2019 s apparent shift of position angered some of the civil-libertarians who \u2019 d been defending it most forcefully early in the week . \u201c Until now , \u201d lawyer and blogger Scott Greenfield wrote , the ACLU has \u201c never quite come out and announced that they will refuse to defend a constitutional right . This announcement says that when someone seeks to exercise two rights at the same time , the ACLU is outta there . \u201d\nAt the same time , though , it \u2019 s not clear that Romero \u2019 s statement is enough to appease the progressives who believe that the ACLU has blood on its hands for Charlottesville . Because not only is what \u2019 s legal not always the same as what \u2019 s right ( as Waldo Jaquith said ) , but in this case , the answers to both of those questions are hotly contested .\nLegally , the relationship between the 1st and 2nd Amendments is complicated \u2014 and the ACLU stepped in it\nIn practice , freedom of speech isn \u2019 t exactly absolute : \u201c Government may not censor speech because of its viewpoint , \u201d says former ACLU director Nadine Strossen , \u201c but it may censor speech because of its effects . \u201d\nTo be specific , government can prevent speech in the case of an \u201c emergency \u201d \u2014 when it \u2019 s clear that there \u2019 s no other way to prevent or protect against violence . But for more than a century , the courts have wrestled with what responsibility someone has when their speech results in violence \u2014 and when it \u2019 s okay to outlaw the former to prevent the latter .\nOne speech emergency is a \u201c true threat \u201d \u2014 speech that is intended to provoke a \u201c reasonable fear that you are going to be attacked or harmed by the person engaging in the expression. \u201d Another ( the one that the ACLU \u2019 s California affiliates appeared to be invoking in their statement ) is incitement : as defense lawyer and blogger Ken White puts it , \u201c Is it intended to , and likely to , cause imminent lawless action ? \u201d\nThe \u201c imminent \u201d is important . \u201c Speech about why it \u2019 s morally appropriate to do lawless things is not incitement , \u201d White says .\nAn earlier legal standard held that the government could prohibit speech that had a \u201c bad tendency \u201d to result in lawless action down the road \u2014 a standard that was used to censor Communists and antiwar protesters , among other groups . But in 1969 , the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Ohio couldn \u2019 t prosecute speakers at a KKK rally simply for advocating for \u201c reveangeance \u201d against \u201c n * * * * * rs \u201d and \u201c Jews. \u201d The reason , as Strossen puts it : \u201c They were having a rally just for themselves . There was nobody else there , and nobody could see it , \u201d so there wasn \u2019 t an imminent danger . ( The KKK , in that case , was represented by the ACLU . )\nBut as that case makes clear , incitement isn \u2019 t just about what someone says but the context in which they say it . The same is true for \u201c true threats \u201d \u2014 the question is what about the context in which the speech is offered makes it clear that it \u2019 s reasonable for someone to feel afraid of harm .\nAnd in the 21st century , the context in which this sort of speech is being delivered as part of a public protest is different for one big reason : guns .\n\u201c The cases acknowledging an individual right to bear arms are very recent , \u201d White points out . After decades of maintaining that the Second Amendment applies to groups of people ( a \u201c well-organized militia \u201d ) instead of individuals seeking to own and carry guns , the Supreme Court sided with the \u201c individual right \u201d in the 2008 case Heller v. District of Columbia . That puts it \u201c like 50 years behind where the First Amendment is , \u201d White says , in terms of case law about what that right actually means : who it refers to , when it applies , and what if any \u201c emergencies \u201d justify the government curtailing it .\nIn other words , when groups of people decide to rally at a location for political purposes , and many of those people decide to bring guns , they \u2019 re sitting at the intersection of two different rights . And , White says , \u201c I don \u2019 t think that we \u2019 ve really developed the law yet very well on the connection between \u201d them .\nAnd there isn \u2019 t an obvious bright line about what kind of speech is turned into a threat or an incitement when there \u2019 s a gun involved .\n\u201c I can certainly imagine if I were for example a counterdemonstrator , and I \u2019 m demonstrating against people who are there brandishing firearms , I think I would feel very frightened and I think that would be a reasonable fear , \u201d says Strossen . \u201c Even as I \u2019 m describing it , I think my imagination \u2019 s pretty good , because I \u2019 m feeling a little chill go down my body . \u201d\nBut White is adamant that \u201c carrying weapons isn \u2019 t in itself incitement , \u201d and that someone can \u2019 t argue they face \u201c reasonable fear \u201d from a demonstrator simply carrying a weapon in a place where it \u2019 s legal to do so . \u201c Combine open carry with a statement like \u2018 we are coming for you , \u2019 and you 've got something , \u201d he says . \u201c But you still need a threat . \u201d\nIn other words , all of these cases are inevitably going to come down to the details of who said what and when \u2014 details that are hard enough to figure out in advance , when the question is whether government will allow a future event to happen , and that are certainly not easy to draw a general principle on .\nStrossen interprets Romero \u2019 s statement of the ACLU \u2019 s new policy as a commitment to \u201c look even closer at the facts \u201d before deciding which cases to take on . But \u201c at a time when legal specificity is needed , \u201d says White , \u201c they \u2019 re being dangerously vague about what they think the law is . \u201d\nHe points out that the California affiliates \u2019 statement \u201c was issued in the context of imminent ( right-wing ) marches in California . Are they saying it isn \u2019 t constitutionally protected ? Are they saying it shouldn \u2019 t be ? \u201d\nAnd are they saying that the real problem is the guns , or that the people holding them are white supremacists ?\nThe people mad at the ACLU don \u2019 t believe there \u2019 s an easy distinction between speech and violence\nWithout being vague enough to drive lawyers like Ken White crazy , though , the ACLU \u2019 s statements would have seemed totally tone-deaf and non-responsive to the controversy raging around them . Because the question that \u2019 s engulfed the progressive movement in the week after Charlottesville is whether the mere existence of outspoken white supremacy , in public performance , is an existential threat .\nFrom a leftist perspective , there \u2019 s more to violence than physical aggression \u2014 it \u2019 s also violent to promote ideas that see other groups of people as less than human , marginalize them , or prevent them from speaking . Those are the people who believe that \u201c hate speech \u201d either isn \u2019 t protected as free speech , or that it shouldn \u2019 t be \u2014 because in the case of \u201c hate speech , \u201d speech and violence are the same thing .\nThe NYU law professor Jeremy Waldron laid out this case in a 2012 book , The Harm in Hate Speech . He argued that the message sent by \u201c hate speech \u201d was \u201c to negate the implicit assurance that a society offers to the members of vulnerable groups \u2014 that they are accepted \u201d and that they can go about their day \u201c with no need to face hostility , violence , discrimination or exclusion by others. \u201d To Waldron , that \u2019 s an assurance the government is obligated to provide to all people equally , and if hate speech undermines it then hate speech ought to be curtailed .\nEven some progressives who don \u2019 t believe in outlawing \u201c hate speech \u201d in general believe that white supremacy and Naziism are inherently violent ideologies , and therefore that adhering to them is a call for violence in its own right .\nNot with words -- you can \u2019 t fight it with words . With fists . \u2014 C.A . Punchallnazis ( @ EyePatchGuy ) August 17 , 2017\nThe debate isn \u2019 t over punching Nazis with guns , it \u2019 s over punching Nazis .\nBut the ACLU has built its reputation , for decades , on the idea that there is no ideology so dangerous it doesn \u2019 t deserve vigorous First Amendment protections . \u201c Going back to the organization \u2019 s founding in 1920 , \u201d says Strossen , \u201c it was defending freedom of speech for anti-civil-libertarians , everybody from fascists to communists. \u201d ( This is something of a whitewash of the ACLU \u2019 s institutional history \u2014 like a lot of other establishment liberal organizations in the 1950s , it was too afraid of McCarthyism to defend Communists and even required members to abjure Communism in an oath \u2014 but it \u2019 s a decent account of its impact on the current state of free-speech law . )\nFrom the perspective of civil libertarians , those cases \u2014 and the Skokie Nazi case \u2014 prevented a dangerous slippery slope : any legal precedent that gets set restricting speech because of what it says can easily be turned against any other speech the government doesn \u2019 t favor . If the paradigmatic free-speech cases of 50 years ago protected racist right-wingers , the precedents they overturned had prosecuted communists , pacifists , labor unionists , and civil-rights and racial-justice advocates .\nIt \u2019 s mind-boggling to civil libertarians like Strossen and White that any progressive , in the Trump era , would be okay with the government deciding what speech is inherently hateful or violent and what isn \u2019 t .\nAdvocating for punching Nazis is your 1st Amendment right ! Though it probably would n't be if we expand the legal definition of 'incitement ' . \u2014 Trevor Timm ( @ trevortimm ) August 17 , 2017\n\u201c If people understood that US law draws very sensible lines between punishable and protected speech , \u201d says Strossen , \u201c I think they would have a lot more confidence that current law is the way to go. \u201d The unspoken counterpart : if people tried to move those lines , they wouldn \u2019 t end up being able to control where the law ended up .\nCivil libertarians see a bright line in terms of law \u2014 they have to protect a particular legal principle unconditionally , because otherwise the principle will disappear . Meanwhile , their critics see a bright line in terms of power . To many progressives , the question of who needs to be protected is much more important than the ideas being used to justify it \u2014 and they feel it \u2019 s simply not all that difficult to step in when a principle is being used to benefit the powerless , and step back when it \u2019 s used to benefit the powerful .\nThis won \u2019 t be the last time the ACLU comes under fire for whose rights it chooses to defend\nIn retrospect , it \u2019 s a little surprising that the ACLU wasn \u2019 t better prepared to come under fire from the left over Charlottesville ; after all , it had just survived another progressive uproar about taking on a right-wing client .\nThe week before the Charlottesville rally , the national ACLU and the DC and Virginia affiliates announced that they were suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority , which regulates the Metro subway system in DC , for rejecting ads deemed \u201c political . \u201d\nThe group of rejected advertisers represented by the ACLU included a women \u2019 s-health network that specializes in contraceptives and abortion \u2014 but it also included right-wing firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos , who \u2019 s managed to squeeze 15 minutes of fame out of saying inflammatory things and being protested on ( and banned from ) college campuses because of them .\nPerhaps unsurprisingly , the headline became \u201c ACLU defends Milo. \u201d And several progressives were annoyed at best and outraged at worst \u2014 not because they were particularly invested in keeping Yiannopoulos \u2019 ads off the DC Metro , but because they didn \u2019 t understand why the ACLU was choosing to take him on as a client ( especially when they could have taken a lower-key approach , like filing a brief on his behalf ) .\nThis is the root of the progressive objection to the ACLU : not that the things it is doing are legally wrong , but that by picking battles that don \u2019 t always align with progressive objectives it \u2019 s missing the forest of justice for the trees .\n\u201c The danger that communities face because of their speech isn \u2019 t equal , \u201d K-Sue Park wrote in her Thursday New York Times column . \u201c The A.C.L.U. \u2019 s decision to offer legal support to a right-wing cause , then a left-wing cause , won \u2019 t make it so . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a charge that \u2019 s been leveled against the ACLU since Skokie and earlier . In a post-Skokie debate between the ACLU \u2019 s then-director and a leftist lawyer from the National Lawyers Guild , the leftist lawyer opened with : \u201c The law is not neutral . The courts are not neutral . The A.C.L.U . is not as neutral as it pretends . \u201d\nBut the progressive critique now , as articulated by Park , is actually that the ACLU is neutral , and reality isn \u2019 t . It \u2019 s an argument progressives also made in 2010 , when the ACLU supported the Supreme Court \u2019 s controversial decision in Citizens United , which struck down restrictions on campaign finance as a First Amendment violation . Park writes that power determines whose speech matters , and that a real defense of \u201c free speech \u201d would \u201c imagine a holistic picture of how speech rights are under attack right now \u201d \u2014 for everything from corporations to criminal law and voting restrictions \u2014 \u201c not focus on only First Amendment case law . \u201d\nFrom this perspective , allowing the government to pick and choose whose speech is protected isn \u2019 t a slippery slope \u2014 it \u2019 s already happening . ( The fact that state legislatures in Tennessee and Florida considered bills in 2017 that would give immunity from civil lawsuits to drivers who ran into protesters blocking streets was used both by Ken White in arguing for \u201c viewpoint-neutral \u201d free speech protection , and by Park in her op-ed arguing against it \u2014 with both of them using the example to make the case that the current power structure is biased against left-leaning dissent . ) The difference is that it \u2019 s happening in ways that they allege are too subtle for the ACLU \u2019 s current strategy .\nThe ACLU rebranded itself for the resistance . And now it \u2019 s reaping the backlash .\nWhat \u2019 s odd about Park \u2019 s critique is that the ACLU is involved in many , if not most , of the issues she thinks are posing a more urgent threat to free speech than attempts to restrain Nazis from marching on Lee Square . The contemporary ACLU has whole divisions dedicated to voting rights , criminal justice , and LGBTQ rights . It consistently advocates for affirmative action . It \u2019 s poured millions into an effort to protect immigrant rights at the state level . It has become , in many ways , enmeshed with the rest of the progressive movement .\nBut that \u2019 s also what makes Park \u2019 s critique , and the critique of others who agree with her , hit so close to home . Because the ACLU does look like a progressive organization right now , it \u2019 s particularly striking when it disagrees with the rest of the progressive movement .\nThis was true before the 2016 election ( it \u2019 s why the ACLU took so much heat for Citizens United ) . But in the wake of the election of Donald Trump , it really looked like the ACLU itself was embracing an identity as a leader of the progressive movement .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the election , the ACLU became a touchstone organization for progressives ( from people on Twitter to celebrities ) to broadcast their support for and call for donations to . After all , it was an umbrella organization working on a range of issues that tracked with the people most likely to be made vulnerable under a Trump administration , but the fact that it was not explicitly on the Democrats \u2019 \u201c side \u201d made it look like a symbol of the transpartisan decency that the country had lost by electing Trump .\nBy February , the organization had raised $ 79 million since the election ( from 1 million donors ) . Its membership had more than doubled . But along with that flood of support came the expectation that the ACLU actually do something with it , and become a # resistance leader .\nGrassroots movement-building wasn \u2019 t the organization \u2019 s traditional strength , but it became a new focus . Visit the ACLU \u2019 s website today , and this is the banner you \u2019 ll see , above a picture of Trump and the headline \u201c THE FIGHT IS ON \u201d :\nAnd they \u2019 ve used that network to mobilize on progressive economic issues beyond the organization \u2019 s traditional mission \u2014 during the fight over Congressional repeal of the Affordable Care Act , for example , the ACLU fought hard to resist cuts to Medicaid .\nIf someone didn \u2019 t know anything about the ACLU before the election \u2014 or if they believed , with some reason , that the group was remaking itself for the Trump era \u2014 it makes sense they \u2019 d be alarmed to see the ACLU defending Trump allies like Milo Yiannopoulos , or helping the white supremacists who Trump was excoriated for calling \u201c very fine people \u201d in Charlottesville . That doesn \u2019 t seem like resistance , it seems like helping the people trying to crush the resistance .\nAs far as the ACLU \u2019 s traditional values are concerned , resistance is what you do , not the side you \u2019 re on . And they \u2019 re used to members not agreeing with everything they \u2019 re working on : \u201c no thinking person could possibly agree with every single thing that the ACLU does , \u201d says Strossen .\nBut she hastens to add , \u201c I think it \u2019 s essential that there be at least one organization that is striving to do what our government is required to do , which is to defend all fundamental freedoms for all people regardless of the color of skin and regardless of the color of your ideology . \u201d\nTraditionally , that principle has been immune to pressure from members . But with more members \u2014 and members with higher expectations , than ever before \u2014 it \u2019 s not yet clear whether the post-Charlottesville reset the ACLU \u2019 s attempting is a way to smooth over the difference between their vision of justice and many of their members \u2019 \u2014 or a step to bring themselves in line with the progressive resistance group members may want them to be .",
    "content_original": "\u201cThe ACLU has blood on its hands.\u201d\n\nIt was a not-uncommon sentiment in the wake of last week\u2019s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, in which 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed (allegedly at the hands of white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr.) and far-right activists assaulted and intimidated counterprotesters.\n\nThe ACLU had sued the city of Charlottesville to allow the Unite the Right rally to happen downtown. And now, it had happened, and blood had been spilled.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s been through this cycle before. When the ACLU famously defended the rights of a Nazi group to march through a largely Jewish neighborhood in Skokie, Illinois, in the 1970s \u2014 a case that\u2019s set the parameters of First Amendment protections for protests for the last 50 years \u2014 it lost thousands of members and faced bitter questions from liberal American Jews about how it could defend the group that had killed their relatives (and in some cases tortured them) just a few decades before.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t the same Nazis who marched through Skokie, and this isn\u2019t the same progressive movement \u2014 and it isn\u2019t the same ACLU, either. The backlash has already spurred other ACLU chapters to declare that they don\u2019t believe free-speech protections apply to events like the one in Charlottesville, and led the ACLU\u2019s national director, Anthony Romero, to declare the group will no longer defend the right to protest when the protesters want to carry guns.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s response didn\u2019t resolve the underlying problem. It didn\u2019t fully address a criticism put forward everywhere from Twitter to the New York Times, which published a column from former ACLU volunteer K-Sue Park on Thursday called \u201cThe ACLU Needs to Rethink Free Speech.\u201d\n\nAnd with city governments already moving to restrict future far-right rallies to prevent a recurrence of what happened in Charlottesville \u2014 the city of Berkeley just passed an emergency ordinance allowing the police to dissolve gatherings that don\u2019t have permits, for example, in anticipation of a forthcoming \u201calt-right\u201d rally there \u2014 the ACLU is going to have to make some very quick decisions about when and how it will defend the far right in 2017.\n\nThe ACLU seemed like it was in the midst of a partial reinvention as an explicitly progressive organization for the Donald Trump era. It was one of the biggest beneficiaries from the #resistance groundswell of small donations and grassroots interest after the 2016 election, and it\u2019s leaned into the idea of itself as a movement organization rather than just the country\u2019s most powerful public-interest law firm.\n\nBut the Charlottesville rally called attention to an important fault line between the ACLU\u2019s traditional vision of justice and the way the progressive grassroots movement sees justice in 2017: a fight over whether the best way to protect the powerless is to stand against the principles that could be used to crush them, or simply to stand on the side of people seeking social equality by whatever means are necessary.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s new line post-Charlottesville: firearms and free speech don\u2019t mix\n\nIn the days before the Unite the Right rally, it became clear that Charlottesville would be a gathering point for both right-wing rallygoers and left-wing counterprotesters. The city of Charlottesville attempted to defuse the situation by moving the Unite the Right rally away from its original location \u2014 Lee Square, in downtown Charlottesville, featuring the statue of Robert E.

The bulk of the violence was initiated by rallygoers, and as counterprotesters marched down a street hours after the rally, a car (allegedly driven by Fields, who had attended the rally carrying a shield with the logo of white-supremacist group Vanguard America) killed Heyer and injured 19 other counterprotesters.\n\nAlmost immediately, some progressives began to ask why the ACLU had fought to allow this to happen. ACLU of Virginia board member Waldo Jaquith resigned, alleging on Twitter that the organization ignored signs that rally organizers were encouraging violence \u2014 and that \u201cwhat is legal is not always right.\u201d\n\nI just resigned from the ACLU of Virginia board.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s legal and what\u2019s right are sometimes different. I won\u2019t be a fig leaf for Nazis. \u2014 Waldo Jaquith (@waldojaquith) August 13, 2017\n\nWith more \u201calt-right\u201d rallies planned for the weeks after Charlottesville, and mounting pressure on the ACLU to stop \u201cdefending Nazis,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s California affiliates issued a statement on Wednesday declaring, \u201cWe review each request for help on a case-by-case basis, but take the clear position that the First Amendment does not protect people who incite or engage in violence. If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people, they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nAt first, it seemed like the California affiliates were subtweeting, or even splitting with, their Virginia counterpart. But on Thursday, the national organization appeared to side with the Californians \u2014 and draw a new line that would have prevented them from defending Unite the Right. ACLU director Anthony Romero told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cIf a protest group insists, \u2018No, we want to be able to carry loaded firearms,\u2019 well, we don\u2019t have to represent them. They can find someone else.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s apparent shift of position angered some of the civil-libertarians who\u2019d been defending it most forcefully early in the week. \u201cUntil now,\u201d lawyer and blogger Scott Greenfield wrote, the ACLU has \u201cnever quite come out and announced that they will refuse to defend a constitutional right. This announcement says that when someone seeks to exercise two rights at the same time, the ACLU is outta there.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, though, it\u2019s not clear that Romero\u2019s statement is enough to appease the progressives who believe that the ACLU has blood on its hands for Charlottesville. Because not only is what\u2019s legal not always the same as what\u2019s right (as Waldo Jaquith said), but in this case, the answers to both of those questions are hotly contested.\n\nLegally, the relationship between the 1st and 2nd Amendments is complicated \u2014 and the ACLU stepped in it\n\nIn practice, freedom of speech isn\u2019t exactly absolute: \u201cGovernment may not censor speech because of its viewpoint,\u201d says former ACLU director Nadine Strossen, \u201cbut it may censor speech because of its effects.\u201d\n\nTo be specific, government can prevent speech in the case of an \u201cemergency\u201d \u2014 when it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s no other way to prevent or protect against violence. But for more than a century, the courts have wrestled with what responsibility someone has when their speech results in violence \u2014 and when it\u2019s okay to outlaw the former to prevent the latter.\n\nOne speech emergency is a \u201ctrue threat\u201d \u2014 speech that is intended to provoke a \u201creasonable fear that you are going to be attacked or harmed by the person engaging in the expression.\u201d Another (the one that the ACLU\u2019s California affiliates appeared to be invoking in their statement) is incitement: as defense lawyer and blogger Ken White puts it, \u201cIs it intended to, and likely to, cause imminent lawless action?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cimminent\u201d is important. \u201cSpeech about why it\u2019s morally appropriate to do lawless things is not incitement,\u201d White says.\n\nAn earlier legal standard held that the government could prohibit speech that had a \u201cbad tendency\u201d to result in lawless action down the road \u2014 a standard that was used to censor Communists and antiwar protesters, among other groups. But in 1969, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Ohio couldn\u2019t prosecute speakers at a KKK rally simply for advocating for \u201creveangeance\u201d against \u201cn*****rs\u201d and \u201cJews.\u201d The reason, as Strossen puts it: \u201cThey were having a rally just for themselves. There was nobody else there, and nobody could see it,\u201d so there wasn\u2019t an imminent danger. (The KKK, in that case, was represented by the ACLU.)\n\nBut as that case makes clear, incitement isn\u2019t just about what someone says but the context in which they say it. The same is true for \u201ctrue threats\u201d \u2014 the question is what about the context in which the speech is offered makes it clear that it\u2019s reasonable for someone to feel afraid of harm.\n\nAnd in the 21st century, the context in which this sort of speech is being delivered as part of a public protest is different for one big reason: guns.\n\n\u201cThe cases acknowledging an individual right to bear arms are very recent,\u201d White points out. After decades of maintaining that the Second Amendment applies to groups of people (a \u201cwell-organized militia\u201d) instead of individuals seeking to own and carry guns, the Supreme Court sided with the \u201cindividual right\u201d in the 2008 case Heller v. District of Columbia. That puts it \u201clike 50 years behind where the First Amendment is,\u201d White says, in terms of case law about what that right actually means: who it refers to, when it applies, and what if any \u201cemergencies\u201d justify the government curtailing it.\n\nIn other words, when groups of people decide to rally at a location for political purposes, and many of those people decide to bring guns, they\u2019re sitting at the intersection of two different rights. And, White says, \u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve really developed the law yet very well on the connection between\u201d them.\n\nAnd there isn\u2019t an obvious bright line about what kind of speech is turned into a threat or an incitement when there\u2019s a gun involved.\n\n\u201cI can certainly imagine if I were for example a counterdemonstrator, and I\u2019m demonstrating against people who are there brandishing firearms, I think I would feel very frightened and I think that would be a reasonable fear,\u201d says Strossen. \u201cEven as I\u2019m describing it, I think my imagination\u2019s pretty good, because I\u2019m feeling a little chill go down my body.\u201d\n\nBut White is adamant that \u201ccarrying weapons isn\u2019t in itself incitement,\u201d and that someone can\u2019t argue they face \u201creasonable fear\u201d from a demonstrator simply carrying a weapon in a place where it\u2019s legal to do so. \u201cCombine open carry with a statement like \u2018we are coming for you,\u2019 and you've got something,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you still need a threat.\u201d\n\nIn other words, all of these cases are inevitably going to come down to the details of who said what and when \u2014 details that are hard enough to figure out in advance, when the question is whether government will allow a future event to happen, and that are certainly not easy to draw a general principle on.\n\nStrossen interprets Romero\u2019s statement of the ACLU\u2019s new policy as a commitment to \u201clook even closer at the facts\u201d before deciding which cases to take on. But \u201cat a time when legal specificity is needed,\u201d says White, \u201cthey\u2019re being dangerously vague about what they think the law is.\u201d\n\nHe points out that the California affiliates\u2019 statement \u201cwas issued in the context of imminent (right-wing) marches in California. Are they saying it isn\u2019t constitutionally protected? Are they saying it shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d\n\nAnd are they saying that the real problem is the guns, or that the people holding them are white supremacists?\n\nThe people mad at the ACLU don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an easy distinction between speech and violence\n\nWithout being vague enough to drive lawyers like Ken White crazy, though, the ACLU\u2019s statements would have seemed totally tone-deaf and non-responsive to the controversy raging around them. Because the question that\u2019s engulfed the progressive movement in the week after Charlottesville is whether the mere existence of outspoken white supremacy, in public performance, is an existential threat.\n\nFrom a leftist perspective, there\u2019s more to violence than physical aggression \u2014 it\u2019s also violent to promote ideas that see other groups of people as less than human, marginalize them, or prevent them from speaking. Those are the people who believe that \u201chate speech\u201d either isn\u2019t protected as free speech, or that it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 because in the case of \u201chate speech,\u201d speech and violence are the same thing.\n\nThe NYU law professor Jeremy Waldron laid out this case in a 2012 book, The Harm in Hate Speech. He argued that the message sent by \u201chate speech\u201d was \u201cto negate the implicit assurance that a society offers to the members of vulnerable groups \u2014 that they are accepted\u201d and that they can go about their day \u201cwith no need to face hostility, violence, discrimination or exclusion by others.\u201d To Waldron, that\u2019s an assurance the government is obligated to provide to all people equally, and if hate speech undermines it then hate speech ought to be curtailed.\n\nEven some progressives who don\u2019t believe in outlawing \u201chate speech\u201d in general believe that white supremacy and Naziism are inherently violent ideologies, and therefore that adhering to them is a call for violence in its own right.\n\nNot with words -- you can\u2019t fight it with words. With fists. \u2014 C.A. Punchallnazis (@EyePatchGuy) August 17, 2017\n\nThe debate isn\u2019t over punching Nazis with guns, it\u2019s over punching Nazis.\n\nBut the ACLU has built its reputation, for decades, on the idea that there is no ideology so dangerous it doesn\u2019t deserve vigorous First Amendment protections. \u201cGoing back to the organization\u2019s founding in 1920,\u201d says Strossen, \u201cit was defending freedom of speech for anti-civil-libertarians, everybody from fascists to communists.\u201d (This is something of a whitewash of the ACLU\u2019s institutional history \u2014 like a lot of other establishment liberal organizations in the 1950s, it was too afraid of McCarthyism to defend Communists and even required members to abjure Communism in an oath \u2014 but it\u2019s a decent account of its impact on the current state of free-speech law.)\n\nFrom the perspective of civil libertarians, those cases \u2014 and the Skokie Nazi case \u2014 prevented a dangerous slippery slope: any legal precedent that gets set restricting speech because of what it says can easily be turned against any other speech the government doesn\u2019t favor. If the paradigmatic free-speech cases of 50 years ago protected racist right-wingers, the precedents they overturned had prosecuted communists, pacifists, labor unionists, and civil-rights and racial-justice advocates.\n\nIt\u2019s mind-boggling to civil libertarians like Strossen and White that any progressive, in the Trump era, would be okay with the government deciding what speech is inherently hateful or violent and what isn\u2019t.\n\nAdvocating for punching Nazis is your 1st Amendment right! Though it probably wouldn't be if we expand the legal definition of 'incitement'. \u2014 Trevor Timm (@trevortimm) August 17, 2017\n\n\u201cIf people understood that US law draws very sensible lines between punishable and protected speech,\u201d says Strossen, \u201cI think they would have a lot more confidence that current law is the way to go.\u201d The unspoken counterpart: if people tried to move those lines, they wouldn\u2019t end up being able to control where the law ended up.\n\nCivil libertarians see a bright line in terms of law \u2014 they have to protect a particular legal principle unconditionally, because otherwise the principle will disappear. Meanwhile, their critics see a bright line in terms of power. To many progressives, the question of who needs to be protected is much more important than the ideas being used to justify it \u2014 and they feel it\u2019s simply not all that difficult to step in when a principle is being used to benefit the powerless, and step back when it\u2019s used to benefit the powerful.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the last time the ACLU comes under fire for whose rights it chooses to defend\n\nIn retrospect, it\u2019s a little surprising that the ACLU wasn\u2019t better prepared to come under fire from the left over Charlottesville; after all, it had just survived another progressive uproar about taking on a right-wing client.\n\nThe week before the Charlottesville rally, the national ACLU and the DC and Virginia affiliates announced that they were suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which regulates the Metro subway system in DC, for rejecting ads deemed \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\nThe group of rejected advertisers represented by the ACLU included a women\u2019s-health network that specializes in contraceptives and abortion \u2014 but it also included right-wing firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, who\u2019s managed to squeeze 15 minutes of fame out of saying inflammatory things and being protested on (and banned from) college campuses because of them.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the headline became \u201cACLU defends Milo.\u201d And several progressives were annoyed at best and outraged at worst \u2014 not because they were particularly invested in keeping Yiannopoulos\u2019 ads off the DC Metro, but because they didn\u2019t understand why the ACLU was choosing to take him on as a client (especially when they could have taken a lower-key approach, like filing a brief on his behalf).\n\nThis is the root of the progressive objection to the ACLU: not that the things it is doing are legally wrong, but that by picking battles that don\u2019t always align with progressive objectives it\u2019s missing the forest of justice for the trees.\n\n\u201cThe danger that communities face because of their speech isn\u2019t equal,\u201d K-Sue Park wrote in her Thursday New York Times column. \u201cThe A.C.L.U.\u2019s decision to offer legal support to a right-wing cause, then a left-wing cause, won\u2019t make it so.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a charge that\u2019s been leveled against the ACLU since Skokie and earlier. In a post-Skokie debate between the ACLU\u2019s then-director and a leftist lawyer from the National Lawyers Guild, the leftist lawyer opened with: \u201cThe law is not neutral. The courts are not neutral. The A.C.L.U. is not as neutral as it pretends.\u201d\n\nBut the progressive critique now, as articulated by Park, is actually that the ACLU is neutral, and reality isn\u2019t. It\u2019s an argument progressives also made in 2010, when the ACLU supported the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial decision in Citizens United, which struck down restrictions on campaign finance as a First Amendment violation. Park writes that power determines whose speech matters, and that a real defense of \u201cfree speech\u201d would \u201cimagine a holistic picture of how speech rights are under attack right now\u201d \u2014 for everything from corporations to criminal law and voting restrictions \u2014 \u201cnot focus on only First Amendment case law.\u201d\n\nFrom this perspective, allowing the government to pick and choose whose speech is protected isn\u2019t a slippery slope \u2014 it\u2019s already happening. (The fact that state legislatures in Tennessee and Florida considered bills in 2017 that would give immunity from civil lawsuits to drivers who ran into protesters blocking streets was used both by Ken White in arguing for \u201cviewpoint-neutral\u201d free speech protection, and by Park in her op-ed arguing against it \u2014 with both of them using the example to make the case that the current power structure is biased against left-leaning dissent.) The difference is that it\u2019s happening in ways that they allege are too subtle for the ACLU\u2019s current strategy.\n\nThe ACLU rebranded itself for the resistance. And now it\u2019s reaping the backlash.\n\nWhat\u2019s odd about Park\u2019s critique is that the ACLU is involved in many, if not most, of the issues she thinks are posing a more urgent threat to free speech than attempts to restrain Nazis from marching on Lee Square. The contemporary ACLU has whole divisions dedicated to voting rights, criminal justice, and LGBTQ rights. It consistently advocates for affirmative action. It\u2019s poured millions into an effort to protect immigrant rights at the state level. It has become, in many ways, enmeshed with the rest of the progressive movement.\n\nBut that\u2019s also what makes Park\u2019s critique, and the critique of others who agree with her, hit so close to home. Because the ACLU does look like a progressive organization right now, it\u2019s particularly striking when it disagrees with the rest of the progressive movement.\n\nThis was true before the 2016 election (it\u2019s why the ACLU took so much heat for Citizens United). But in the wake of the election of Donald Trump, it really looked like the ACLU itself was embracing an identity as a leader of the progressive movement.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, the ACLU became a touchstone organization for progressives (from people on Twitter to celebrities) to broadcast their support for and call for donations to. After all, it was an umbrella organization working on a range of issues that tracked with the people most likely to be made vulnerable under a Trump administration, but the fact that it was not explicitly on the Democrats\u2019 \u201cside\u201d made it look like a symbol of the transpartisan decency that the country had lost by electing Trump.\n\nBy February, the organization had raised $79 million since the election (from 1 million donors). Its membership had more than doubled. But along with that flood of support came the expectation that the ACLU actually do something with it, and become a #resistance leader.\n\nGrassroots movement-building wasn\u2019t the organization\u2019s traditional strength, but it became a new focus. Visit the ACLU\u2019s website today, and this is the banner you\u2019ll see, above a picture of Trump and the headline \u201cTHE FIGHT IS ON\u201d:\n\nAnd they\u2019ve used that network to mobilize on progressive economic issues beyond the organization\u2019s traditional mission \u2014 during the fight over Congressional repeal of the Affordable Care Act, for example, the ACLU fought hard to resist cuts to Medicaid.\n\nIf someone didn\u2019t know anything about the ACLU before the election \u2014 or if they believed, with some reason, that the group was remaking itself for the Trump era \u2014 it makes sense they\u2019d be alarmed to see the ACLU defending Trump allies like Milo Yiannopoulos, or helping the white supremacists who Trump was excoriated for calling \u201cvery fine people\u201d in Charlottesville. That doesn\u2019t seem like resistance, it seems like helping the people trying to crush the resistance.\n\nAs far as the ACLU\u2019s traditional values are concerned, resistance is what you do, not the side you\u2019re on. And they\u2019re used to members not agreeing with everything they\u2019re working on: \u201cno thinking person could possibly agree with every single thing that the ACLU does,\u201d says Strossen.\n\nBut she hastens to add, \u201cI think it\u2019s essential that there be at least one organization that is striving to do what our government is required to do, which is to defend all fundamental freedoms for all people regardless of the color of skin and regardless of the color of your ideology.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, that principle has been immune to pressure from members. But with more members \u2014 and members with higher expectations, than ever before \u2014 it\u2019s not yet clear whether the post-Charlottesville reset the ACLU\u2019s attempting is a way to smooth over the difference between their vision of justice and many of their members\u2019 \u2014 or a step to bring themselves in line with the progressive resistance group members may want them to be.",
