    "content": "The GOP health-care bill shows the need for regular order .\nOnce upon a time , many years ago , Joe Biden labored under the charming delusion that he might someday be elected president of these United States . His ambitions came to nothing \u2014 a little less than that , in fact \u2014 but in the service of them , he set loose an enormously destructive force in American politics \u2014 procedural maximalism \u2014 that has hobbled our institutions and set the nation on a course of fundamental governmental dysfunction .\nWhen the definitive history of American politics in the 20th century is written ( Get on it , Brookhiser ! ) the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court will be understood not as an instance of excessive partisanship but as a transformative event , one equal in significance to the assassination of President John Kennedy or Barry Goldwater \u2019 s presidential campaign .\nWhat people remember of that episode is Senator Edward Kennedy \u2019 s infamous speech describing \u201c Robert Bork \u2019 s America , \u201d \u201c a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions , blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters , rogue police could break down citizens \u2019 doors in midnight raids , schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution , writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government , and the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens . \u201d\nKennedy was the showy performer in that ugly spectacle , but Senator Biden , as chairman of the Judiciary Committee , was the stage director . Prior to Bork \u2019 s nomination , Biden had in fact said that he would support it : Bork was , after all , a distinguished legal scholar with a long history in public service . Bork had many challenges in front of him : For one thing , he was very sharp-elbowed in intellectual disputes , which had not won him very many friends . The Senate majority leader at the time was Democrat Robert Byrd , a man who had rejoiced in the title of Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan , and who held a grudge against Bork for his role in the Watergate scandal , during which Bork had fired special investigator Archibald Cox on the orders of President Richard Nixon . ( Plus \u00e7a change ! ) But even in the absence of that history , Bork \u2019 s nomination would have run into trouble : Democrats had already announced their intention to resist as a \u201c solid phalanx \u201d the nominations of any \u201c ideological extremist \u201d to the high court , \u201c ideological extremist \u201d meaning any nominee who shared the views of President Ronald Reagan , who was so far outside the mainstream that he had won 49 states in the last election . ( Recount Minnesota ! )\nThe Democratic primary field was very full : There was Biden , of course , along with Michael Dukakis , who eventually would win the nomination , as well as Jesse Jackson , Al Gore , Paul Simon . . . and Klansman David Duke , conspiracy kook Lyndon LaRouche , and all-purpose figure of fun James Traficant . Biden could not afford to stand by his earlier assessment of Bork and announced his opposition to the nomination shortly after it was made formal .\nCongress is organized under parliamentary rules , and where there are such rules there always will be procedural shenanigans . The filibuster , for example , has not always been used for the most reputable of purposes : The 14 hours Senator Byrd had spent filibustering the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not prevent him from becoming the Democratic leader in the Senate . The legislative calendar , committee hearings , and such relatively modern innovation as budget reconciliation all have been used in the service of petty politics , which is what politicians do . Complaining about that is like complaining about how wet the water is . But scope and scale and context matter , too . Republican Bob La Follette may very well have been on the wrong side with his 1917 filibuster of a bill that he believed ( correctly ) would lead the United States to intervene in the Great War , but that was a matter of genuine national and historical consequence . Congress may have erred in abbreviating the usual legislative process to pass the PATRIOT Act , but the sense of urgency was proper and legitimate .\nThe Bork nomination , on the other hand , was an ordinary piece of government business elevated by Democrats to the status of national emergency in the service of narrow partisan interests . Biden was running for president , Kennedy was running for conscience of the Democratic party , and Byrd , frustrated by Republicans \u2019 lack of cooperation on a number of his spending priorities , had promised : \u201c They \u2019 re going to pay . I \u2019 m going to hit them where it hurts. \u201d The hysteria and vitriol directed at Bork were of a sort rarely seen since the early 19th century . But they quickly became commonplace .\nDemocrats of course had every legal and constitutional right to oppose Bork \u2019 s nomination for any reason they chose . Senator Kennedy \u2019 s denunciation of Bork was pure slander , but not in the legally actionable sense . Elected officials are allowed to get excited about whatever it is that excites them , and , if their constituents strongly disagree , then they have the means of recourse at their disposal . There \u2019 s an election every other year .\nBut the rules of the game are not all there is to the game . What in another context might be called \u201c sportsmanship \u201d is in politics a question of prudence and even of patriotism , forgoing the pursuit of every petty partisan advantage made possible by the formal rules of the legislative and political processes in deference to the fact that governance in a democratic republic requires a very large degree of cooperation and forbearance . The progress from Robert Bork to Merrick Garland is a fairly obvious story , but there is more to it than that : The increasing reliance upon legislative gimmicks such as omnibus spending bills and retrofitting legislation to fit with the budget reconciliation process , the substitution of executive orders and open-ended regulatory portfolios ( \u201c the secretary shall . . . \u201d ) , the prominence of emergency \u201c special sessions \u201d in the state legislatures , the absence of regular order in the legislative and appropriations process \u2014 all are part of the same destructive tendency .
