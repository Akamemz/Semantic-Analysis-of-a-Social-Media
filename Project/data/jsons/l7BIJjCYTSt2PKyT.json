But pressure quickly mounted after Western intelligence officials said evidence pointed to Iranian involvement .\nThe Ukrainian flight , which was en route to Kyiv , came down near Imam Khomeini Airport shortly after take-off . Victims included dozens of Iranians and Canadians , as well as nationals from Ukraine , the UK , Afghanistan and Germany .\nOn Saturday morning , an Iranian military statement read on state TV announced that it had struck flight PS752 with a missile by mistake .\nIt said the plane had turned towards a `` sensitive military centre '' of the Revolutionary Guards , a force set up to defend the country 's Islamic system .
