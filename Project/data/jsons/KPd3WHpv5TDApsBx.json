    "content": "I recently sat down with former Bush administration Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , the first Hispanic in our nation \u2019 s history to serve in such a post . In our exclusive interview for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Latino , Gonzales cautioned Mitt Romney against picking an Hispanic vice president as he prepares for the Republican Party convention and the November election .\nGonzales , who has endorsed Romney , said he doubts that \u201c Hispanics are going to support Governor Romney simply because he puts [ Florida Senator ] Marco Rubio on the ticket or any other Hispanic on the ticket . \u201d\nThe former Texas Supreme Court Judge concedes Republican Party \u2019 s rhetoric during the primaries was `` harsh '' on immigration `` and hurt the party with respect to bringing Hispanics on board . \u201d\nGonzales suggested that the best way for Romney to repair relations with Latino voters , who currently give more than 60 percent of their vote to President Obama , is through sincere outreach program based on economic policies that will help Hispanics .\nAlong those lines , Gonzales supports Senator Rubio \u2019 s efforts to produce a GOP version of the \u201c DREAM \u201d Act as key to Romney efforts to reach out to Hispanic voters .\nWhen I recently interviewed Sen. Rubio , he told me that Democratic Party proposals to allow young people who were brought into the U.S. without documentation -- and are now enrolled in college or the military -- to gain citizenship will not win Republican support in Congress . But he said he is working on a version of the \u201c DREAM Act \u201d that will allow those young people to avoid deportation and stay in the United States .\nAny Republican effort to help those young people who are here illegally but are educated and possibly have military experience is essential , Gonzales believes , to repairing the GOP \u2019 s relationship with Hispanics .\nIn our interview we also touched on the controversial issue of immigration . Gonzales is a Republican but he differs from many in his party in that he is critical of Arizona \u2019 s controversial S.B . 1070 \u201c Papers Please \u201d law .\nHe bases his opposition to S.B . 1070 on what he sees as the potential for racial profiling in the application of the law .
