In a Tuesday evening speech in Ohio , he even called an impending free trade deal a \u201c rape \u201d of the U.S .\nSpeaking in Pennsylvania , where he hopes his populist economic message resonates , the billionaire businessman said globalization had failed American workers .

Bernard Sanders , whose far-left run tapped into similar populist strains .\n\u201c The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change , \u201d said Mr. Trump .\nHe later said , \u201c Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small \u2014 and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future . \u201d\nMr. Trump said he offered real change , not the kind promised by Barack Obama in his 2008 campaign for president .\nBeyond trade , he hit Mrs. Clinton for backing anti-coal policies and favoring high taxes and burdensome regulations that he said strangle American businesses .\nPennsylvania , which hasn \u2019 t voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988 , is shaping up to be a key battleground . The state \u2019 s blue-collar voters are expected to be receptive to Mr. Trump \u2019 s aggressive message on trade , as are those in Ohio , which is also a must-win state for Republicans .\nMr. Trump later held a rally in nearby St. Clairsville , Ohio , where he denounced the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal as a sellout of American workers \u2014 and worse .\n\u201c The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country \u2014 just a continuing rape of our country , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s a harsh word , but it \u2019 s true . \u201d\nUnlike his free-form rallies , Mr. Trump used a teleprompter and mostly stuck to a script for the trade speech in Pennsylvania .
