Prominent Mormons including David G. Neeleman , the JetBlue founder , and Eric Varvel , the chief executive officer of the banking division at Credit Suisse , are on his finance team .\nMany of Mr. Romney \u2019 s major Mormon backers are tied to businesses with robust agendas in Washington \u2014 lobbying on tax , aviation and tourism policy , according to federal filings \u2014 and have something to gain by having a friend in the White House .\nBut several of these donors say that their giving has nothing to do with their business interests . And while that is a common refrain among major financial supporters of both parties , in this case the candidacy they are backing represents something bigger as it draws new attention to their religion .\n\u201c I think for Mormons , particularly for prominent ones who already feel widely accepted and admired individually , this feels like a chance to also see their church , which they love , accepted and admired institutionally , \u201d said Richard Eyre , a Mormon and a best-selling author who lives in Utah and is a friend of the Romneys .\nIt is no small thing to Mormons that not one but two of their number were considered appealing contenders for the presidency this year : Mr. Romney and former Gov .

But Mr. Huntsman , less involved in the church than Mr. Romney , was unable to tap into the Mormon network as Mr. Romney has been .\nThroughout Mr. Huntsman \u2019 s primary campaign some on his team reported receiving a subtle but clear signal : This is Mr. Romney \u2019 s year .\nNow the presumptive Republican nominee , Mr. Romney \u2019 s base of support is broadening steadily . As his national finance director Spencer Zwick , who is Mormon , said , \u201c We are now beginning our Catholics coalition for Romney ; we have a Jewish fund-raising director \u2014 the only way that a campaign turns into a cause is if you have outreach to many different groups . \u201d\nIn interviews , several of Mr. Romney \u2019 s supporters expressed their concerns that attention to the financial support he has received from other early families of the religion would raise old prejudices and accusations of clannishness that followed their forebears . For many , their support is born of their personal admiration for Mr. Romney , as well as of their shared values and experiences with him , whether in business , at Brigham Young University or as high-level lay officials of the church .\n\u201c Obviously , there \u2019 s a Mormon tie there , \u201d said Kevin B. Rollins , a former Bain & Company partner and onetime chief executive of Dell computers , who has donated $ 375,000 to Restore Our Future . \u201c But it \u2019 s much more about his competency as a manager and an administrator. \u201d You don \u2019 t keep winning positions of leadership if you mess them up , he said .\nMr. Rollins came to know Mr. Romney when Mr. Romney was running the Bain private equity firm , and now holds the Mormon \u201c stake presidency \u201d in Boston that Mr. Romney once held .\nBill Marriott , who donated $ 1 million personally to Restore Our Future , said he did so out of friendship .
