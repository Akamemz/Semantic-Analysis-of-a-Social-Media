Chris Stewart , R-Utah , and Brad Wenstrup , R-Ohio , last week introduced the FISA Improvements Act in a bid to \u201c stop these abuses \u201d and effectively amend FISA by adding requirements on the FBI , the DOJ and on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) , which would also give Congress \u201c critical new insight to perform oversight of the FISA powers . \u201d\n\u201c The deceptive actions of a few high-ranking officials within the FBI and the Department of Justice have eroded public trust in our federal institutions , \u201d Stewart stated . \u201c They flattened internal guardrails , deceived the FISA court , and irreparably damaged the reputation of an innocent American . \u201d\nThat American was 2016 Trump campaign aide , Carter Page . Horowitz \u2019 s report noted \u201c 17 significant errors or omissions \u201d in the application process for FISA warrants for Page , and underscored \u201c many additional errors , \u201d including how the FBI informed the FISA court that its primary source outlining possible collusion with Russia , Christopher Steele , was credible without verifying his assertions . Horowitz also found that investigators withheld crucial details from the FISA tribunal that may have cast doubt on the credibility of Steele 's dossier of claims about Trump .\n\u201c FISA is an important tool in the U.S. fight against espionage and terrorism , and the vast majority of FISA warrants no doubt comply with the original purpose of the Act , \u201d Francey Hakes , a former DOJ official , told Fox News . \u201c But the IG report shows quite clearly the process can be manipulated . FISA reforms are necessary to ensure this never happens again . \u201d\nThe GOP bill would mandate that amicus curiae \u2013 an impartial court advisor \u2013 be assigned to all cases where a U.S. person is involved . It would also ensure that the DOJ disclose \u201c any usage of unverified information in the application , \u201d and include a provision in which any FISA extensions are heard or denied by the same judge which \u201c ensures that the government is not able to obfuscate details of an expiring order \u2019 s newly gathered evidence to support renewal . \u201d\nAdditionally , Rep. Warren Davidson , R-Ohio , has also upped his call for \u201c sweeping reforms \u201d in the wake of Horowitz \u2019 s findings .\n\u201c The secrecy of the court and the actions taken by FBI investigators show that it is too easy to abuse our government \u2019 s surveillance program . Investigators didn \u2019 t vet the Steel dossier properly and neglected to inform the FISA court that it was funded by the DNC , \u201d Davidson stated . \u201c We need to reassert the fourth amendment and protect the privacy of all Americans \u2013 including candidates for political office . \u201d\nAnd Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , has also joined the growing chorus of Republicans urging swift action and new legislation with \u201c major reforms. \u201d Even some well-known GOP hawks have decried the revelations in Horowitz 's report , as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , vowed that the errors \u201c should scare the hell out of us . \u201d\nYet in June this year , the House voted against a bipartisan amendment to FISA , proposed by then-GOP Rep. Justin Amash and Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren , which would have halted the 2020 funding for FISA 's Section 702 , which was only authorized in 2008 as a means to monitor communications by foreign nationals outside the U.S. Amash later left the Republican Party to become an independent .\nScores of civil liberties groups , ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) to the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) to the Government Accountability Project have also re-invigorated their campaigns for FISA transparency amendments , urging lawmakers to take action and stressing that if such egregious errors could happen to a Presidential candidate , it likely has happened to scores of others .\n\u201c FISA benefits law enforcement by approving court surveillance necessary to conduct national security investigations . But like any process that sanctions secrecy , in order to be effective , it requires integrity , honesty , and diligence on behalf of law enforcement , \u201d explained Wendy Patrick , a career trial attorney and business ethics lecturer . \u201c As with an attempt to procure a warrant in any court , if agents omit important evidence , fail to correct past inaccuracies , or misrepresent facts , the judge\u00b4s decision will be compromised . Judicial decisions are only as accurate as of the facts on which they are based . \u201d\nFISA was brought to life in the 1970s after the Church Committee unearthed a number of disconcerting abuses , thus prompting Congress to pass the legislation in 1978 . While its original intent was to safeguard U.S. citizens against government snooping , some experts argue it has moved far from that intent in recent decades .\nThe act brought with it the FISC functions as a secret tribunal , made up of several federal judges selected by the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to serve seven-year terms . The tribunal has the power to approve warrants for electronic surveillance , allowing wiretapping , phone , email , computer , microphone , and physical searches of an alleged \u201c foreign power or an agent of a foreign power , \u201d which may include Americans or citizens suspected of being engaged in terrorism or espionage .\nAccording to Elizabeth Goitein , co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice , \u201c over time parts of the law have been weakened to make it easier to collect certain kinds of information about Americans , which has had the effect of eroding privacy . \u201d\n\u201c For instance , under FISA \u2019 s so-called \u2018 business records \u2019 provision , the government was previously allowed to obtain only certain types of records , and it had to persuade the FISA Court that the subject of the documents was a foreign power or agent of a foreign power . Section 215 of the Patriot Act amended the law to permit the government to obtain literally \u2018 any tangible thing \u2019 upon a mere showing of relevance to a foreign intelligence investigation , \u201d Goitein said . \u201c It is this provision that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) exploited after 9/11 to collect Americans \u2019 phone records in bulk , although Congress effectively ended that practice when it passed the USA Freedom Act in 2015 . \u201d\nAnother example , she underscored , is the addition of Section 702 in 2008 . This authority allows the NSA to engage in a \u201c programmatic \u201d collection of foreigners \u2019 communications , including their communications with Americans , without an individualized court order .\n\u201c The FISA Court \u2019 s role is limited to signing off on the broad procedures for the program \u2013 a much more limited role than Congress ever contemplated when it originally enacted FISA . The FBI has exploited this large-scale , warrantless collection ; it routinely combs through the data collected by the NSA looking for Americans \u2019 phone calls and e-mails to use against them in purely domestic criminal investigations , \u201d Goitein said .\nAnd if a FISA request is denied , there is the option for appeal . Yet almost every application , more than 99 percent , of the tens of thousands put forward by investigators , has been rubber-stamped . As to why the rejection rate is so low , according to legal experts , the answer comes down to whom you ask .\n\u201c Law enforcement would argue because they do such a great job compiling evidence on the front end in order to provide the court everything it needs to make a decision . Most investigators work diligently to build a strong case before submitting a warrant application to the judge , \u201d Patrick surmised . \u201c Skeptics , on the other hand , would argue that the rejection rate is so low because courts rely too heavily on the representations of law enforcement , including the assumption that the evidence submitted includes any exculpatory facts the court should consider . The IG report indicates this is not always the case . \u201d\nAnd the latest IG revelations are not the first time FISA has been exposed for misgivings .\nThe DOJ admitted that in the year 2000 , mistakes were made in 75 surveillance and search applications , which was then documented in an opinion by FISC .
