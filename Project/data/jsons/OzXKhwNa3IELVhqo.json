( Loren Elliott/Reuters )\nSome economic migrants are using children as chits , but the problem is fixable \u2014 if Congress acts .\nThe latest furor over Trump immigration policy involves the separation of children from parents at the border .\nAs usual , the outrage obscures more than it illuminates , so it \u2019 s worth walking through what \u2019 s happening here .\nFor the longest time , illegal immigration was driven by single males from Mexico . Over the last decade , the flow has shifted to women , children , and family units from Central America . This poses challenges we haven \u2019 t confronted before and has made what once were relatively minor wrinkles in the law loom very large .\nThe Trump administration isn \u2019 t changing the rules that pertain to separating an adult from the child . Those remain the same . Separation happens only if officials find that the adult is falsely claiming to be the child \u2019 s parent , or is a threat to the child , or is put into criminal proceedings .\nIt \u2019 s the last that is operative here . The past practice had been to give a free pass to an adult who is part of a family unit . The new Trump policy is to prosecute all adults . The idea is to send a signal that we are serious about our laws and to create a deterrent against re-entry . ( Illegal entry is a misdemeanor , illegal re-entry a felony . )\nWhen a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry , he or she is taken into custody by the U.S . Marshals . In no circumstance anywhere in the U.S. do the marshals care for the children of people they take into custody . The child is taken into the custody of HHS , who cares for them at temporary shelters .\nThe criminal proceedings are exceptionally short , assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entity or another crime . The migrants generally plead guilty , and they are then sentenced to time served , typically all in the same day , although practices vary along the border . After this , they are returned to the custody of ICE .\nIf the adult then wants to go home , in keeping with the expedited order of removal that is issued as a matter of course , it \u2019 s relatively simple . The adult should be reunited quickly with his or her child , and the family returned home as a unit . In this scenario , there \u2019 s only a very brief separation .\nWhere it becomes much more of an issue is if the adult files an asylum claim . In that scenario , the adults are almost certainly going to be detained longer than the government is allowed to hold their children .\nThat \u2019 s because of something called the Flores Consent Decree from 1997 . It says that unaccompanied children can be held only 20 days . A ruling by the Ninth Circuit extended this 20-day limit to children who come as part of family units . So even if we want to hold a family unit together , we are forbidden from doing so .\nThe clock ticking on the time the government can hold a child will almost always run out before an asylum claim is settled . The migrant is allowed ten days to seek an attorney , and there may be continuances or other complications .\nThis creates the choice of either releasing the adults and children together into the country pending the ajudication of the asylum claim , or holding the adults and releasing the children . If the adult is held , HHS places the child with a responsible party in the U.S. , ideally a relative ( migrants are likely to have family and friends here ) .\nEven if Flores didn \u2019 t exist , the government would be very constrained in how many family units it can accommodate . ICE has only about 3,000 family spaces in shelters . It is also limited in its overall space at the border , which is overwhelmed by the ongoing influx . This means that \u2014 whatever the Trump administration would prefer to do \u2014 many adults are still swiftly released .\nWhy try to hold adults at all ? First of all , if an asylum-seeker is detained , it means that the claim goes through the process much more quickly , a couple of months or less rather than years . Second , if an adult is released while the claim is pending , the chances of ever finding that person again once he or she is in the country are dicey , to say the least . It is tantamount to allowing the migrant to live here , no matter what the merits of the case .\n1 ) Family units can go home quickly . The option that both honors our laws and keeps family units together is a swift return home after prosecution . But immigrant advocates hate it because they want the migrants to stay in the United States . How you view this question will depend a lot on how you view the motivation of the migrants ( and how seriously you take our laws and our border ) .\n2 ) There \u2019 s a better way to claim asylum . Every indication is that the migrant flow to the United States is discretionary . It nearly dried up at the beginning of the Trump administration when migrants believed that they had no chance of getting into the United States . Now , it is going in earnest again because the message got out that , despite the rhetoric , the policy at the border hasn \u2019 t changed . This strongly suggests that the flow overwhelmingly consists of economic migrants who would prefer to live in the United States , rather than victims of persecution in their home country who have no option but to get out .\nEven if a migrant does have a credible fear of persecution , there is a legitimate way to pursue that claim , and it does not involve entering the United States illegally . First , such people should make their asylum claim in the first country where they feel safe , i.e. , Mexico or some other country they are traversing to get here . Second , if for some reason they are threatened everywhere but the United States , they should show up at a port of entry and make their claim there rather than crossing the border illegally .\n3 ) There is a significant moral cost to not enforcing the border . There is obviously a moral cost to separating a parent from a child and almost everyone would prefer not to do it .

Not only does this make a mockery of our laws , it creates an incentive for people to keep bringing children with them .\nNeedless to say , children should not be making this journey that is fraught with peril .

They are considered chits .\nSome migrants have admitted they brought their children not only to remove them from danger in such places as Central America and Africa , but because they believed it would cause the authorities to release them from custody sooner . Others have admitted to posing falsely with children who are not their own , and Border Patrol officials say that such instances of fraud are increasing .\nAccording to azcentral.com , it is \u201c common to have parents entrust their children to a smuggler as a favor or for profit . \u201d\nIf someone is determined to come here illegally , the decent and safest thing would be to leave the child at home with a relative and send money back home .
