    "content": "After a tense morning of closed door meetings on Capitol Hill , Senate Republicans have released their version of an Obamacare repeal bill in hopes of getting it to the floor next week for a vote .\nThe Better Care Act is seen as a compromise between moderate and conservative factions among GOP senators and keeps a number of Obamacare taxes and subsidies in place . Without any Democrat support , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes .\n`` This is our opportunity to make a difference . It 's time to build a bridge away from Obamcare 's failures and toward relief for those who need it , '' Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate Floor Thursday . `` It 's time to rise to the occasion . The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare ... the time to deliver that , is next week . ''\nMcConnell argued the 172-page long legislation improves on the previous Senate bill , which was essentially dead on arrival , and provides stability to the insurance markets . He also highlighted the bill 's bolstering of resources to combat the opioid crisis , which is backed up by an increase in spending . Additional spending has also been allocated as a way to reduce premium costs . Health Savings Accounts will be eligible for use toward premium payments .\nAn amendment offered by Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee is not included in its original form . Phil Klein breaks that aspectdown :\nThe bill does not include an amendment from Sens . Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and Mike Lee , R-Utah , as originally written , but it includes a provision that \u2019 s based on the idea . Under the original proposal , an insurer that offered a plan that met all of Obamacare \u2019 s requirements in a state could then offer any additional plans free of the regulations . A new version would set up a fund to help cover those with higher medical costs , but to access the money , an insurer would have to offer at least one compliant plan . At that point , the insurer can offer plans that get around nine of the insurance requirements . The idea is to provide more choices of lower premium plans to healthier individuals with low medical costs who have seen their premiums soar under Obamacare . The waivable requirements include : the requirement to offer all plans to those with pre-existing conditions , the requirement that all plans meet a certain actuarial value , the community rating requirement preventing insurers from pricing plans based on health status , and the mandate that all plans cover a certain set of essential health benefits . Full list here . It \u2019 s important to keep in mind that the bill would not waive the requirement that all states have a single risk pool , which means both the compliant plans offered on the Obamacare exchange and the exempted plans being offered off the exchange would be in the same risk pool . Expect the effects of that distinction to be hotly debated among wonks today .",
