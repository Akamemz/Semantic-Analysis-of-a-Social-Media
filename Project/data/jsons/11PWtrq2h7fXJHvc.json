We need to be able to trace contacts , isolate , quarantine , and appropriately \u2014 while striving to develop a cure , \u201d Bright said . \u201c There will be plenty of time to look back to assess what has happened so we can improve , but right now , we need to focus on getting things right going forward . \u201d\nDr. Rick Bright : `` Our window of opportunity is closing ... I fear the pandemic will get worst and be prolonged ... Without better planing , 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history .

He alleges that his removal from that post was an act of retaliation by Trump administration officials because he resisted a push by the White House to promote unproven coronavirus treatments using hydroxychloroquine .\nIn his opening statement , Bright backed Tuesday \u2019 s Senate testimony by Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation \u2019 s leading infectious disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force .\n\u201c Dr . Fauci delivered a message in a voice that \u2019 s clear and trustworthy as he encouraged us to act with caution as we return to our daily lives , \u201d Bright said . \u201c We must increase the public education about the basics \u2014 washing hands , social distancing , appropriate face covering . \u201d\nBright \u2019 s written testimony , submitted ahead of Thursday \u2019 s hearing , had an even stronger warning : that without clear planning and quick action , the coming winter will be the darkest in recent history . He modulated that warning slightly on Thursday but still struck a sobering note .\n\u201c If we fail to improve our response now , based on science , I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged , \u201d Bright said . \u201c There will be likely a resurgence of Covid-19 this fall , and it will greatly compound the challenges of seasonal influenza . \u201d\nIn his written testimony , Bright describes \u201c dismissive \u201d HHS leadership . He said that , as early as January , he warned the department to ramp up production of ventilators , personal protective equipment , and testing swabs in anticipation of a pandemic , and that his warnings were ignored .\n\u201c I was met with indifference , saying they were either too busy , they didn \u2019 t have a plan , they didn \u2019 t know who was responsible for procuring those , \u201d Bright said of his push for HHS to obtain more PPE . \u201c A number of excuses . But never any action . \u201d\nBright also said in prepared testimony that he was \u201c cut out of key high-level meetings to combat COVID-19 . \u201d\nBright is sounding the alarm about Trump \u2019 s politicization of medical science\nIn April , Bright filed a whistleblower complaint over his removal from the top BARDA job .
