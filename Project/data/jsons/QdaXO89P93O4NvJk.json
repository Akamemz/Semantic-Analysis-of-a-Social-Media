Abrupt Climate Changes Worry Scientists Most\nAn expert panel at the National Academy of Sciences is calling for an early warning system to alert us to abrupt and potentially catastrophic events triggered by climate change .\nThe committee says science can anticipate some major changes to the Earth that could affect everything from agriculture to sea level . But we are n't doing enough to look for those changes and anticipate their impacts .\nAnd this is not a matter for some distant future . The Earth is already experiencing both gradual and abrupt climate change . The air is warming up slowly , and we 're also seeing rapid changes such as the melting Arctic ice cap .\nAnthony Barnosky , a professor of integrative biology at the University of California , Berkeley , says abrupt change is the bigger worry .\n`` When you think about gradual changes you can kind of see where the road is and know where you 're going , '' Barnosky said at a news conference unveiling the report Tuesday . `` When you think about abrupt changes and threshold effects , the road suddenly drops out from under you . And it 's those kinds of things we 're suggesting we need to anticipate in a much more comprehensive way . ''\nScientists know about some potential problems that could change the planet dramatically in a matter of years or decades . For example , sea level could quickly rise by as much as 25 feet if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to crumble into the sea .\nYet committee chairman James White , an earth scientist at the University of Colorado in Boulder , says we 're not watching that ice sheet very carefully to measure how much warming seawater is weakening the ice .\n`` We should be measuring ocean temperatures near the ice sheet , '' White said . `` We should be measuring , far better , where the outlets are \u2014 where the glaciers go into the ocean . We do n't do that . ''\nAnother potential for disaster is in the Arctic . There is a huge amount of methane gas up there . The report says the region is unlikely to belch methane into the atmosphere rapidly and supercharge global warming . But government agencies are n't keeping a close eye on methane and other greenhouse gases in the Arctic .\n`` We have only a handful of sites to look at that , '' White said . `` And since 2007 , [ the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's ] monitoring network \u2014 the primary global measuring network \u2014 has been cut by 30 percent .
