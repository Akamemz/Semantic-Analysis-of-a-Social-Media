The White House \u2019 s initial explanation for the surprise firing centered around a recommendation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who pilloried the director \u2019 s unusually public handling of the bureau \u2019 s investigation into the personal email server maintained by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state .\nBut Trump undercut that explanation days later in an interview with NBC News in which he said he had already made up his mind to fire Comey before meeting with Rosenstein and that he had made the decision with the bureau \u2019 s ongoing Russia investigation on his mind .\nThe news of Wray \u2019 s forthcoming nomination came as a surprise to some powerful senators . Both the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , and the committee \u2019 s ranking Democrat , California Sen.
