Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it is extending eligibility to dependent spouses of H1-B visa holders to obtain work permits as part of Mr. Obama \u2019 s immigration action . Starting in 90 days about 179,600 immigrants will be eligible for the benefit in the first year .\n\u201c Allowing the spouses of these visa holders to legally work in the United States makes perfect sense , \u201d said USCIS Director Leon Rodriguez . \u201c It helps U.S. businesses keep their highly skilled workers by increasing the chances these workers will choose to stay in this country during the transition from temporary workers to permanent residents . \u201d\nBut Sen. Jeff Sessions , Alabama Republican , said the president was unilaterally implementing \u201c another policy , another program that has not been authorized by law that would add several hundred thousand new workers to our country . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s been no sense at all by President Obama , the Department of Homeland Security [ Secretary ] Jeh Johnson , the Democratic members of this Congress , no concern about the employment prospects of lawful immigrants , green card holders and native-born Americans , \u201d Mr . Sessions said . \u201c The first thing we should do is be focusing on getting jobs for Americans that are unemployed . Are we going to keep Americans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more foreigners to take jobs when we \u2019 ve got Americans ready and willing to take those jobs ? \u201d\nThe move comes as Congress considers an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would defund Mr. Obama \u2019 s deportation amnesty .\nOn Tuesday , Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , questioned Homeland \u2019 s Mr. Johnson on whether the administration plans to comply with the court \u2019 s injunction to stop the deportation amnesty .
