Jan Schakowsky ( IL ) , Jared Huffman ( CA ) , and Diana DeGette ( CO ) , sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) on April 6 , urging Secretary Alex Azar to waive restrictions on research using aborted fetal tissue for vaccine research .\nYou have repeatedly stated that your agency is doing everything you can to develop vaccines and treatments for the novel coronavirus .
