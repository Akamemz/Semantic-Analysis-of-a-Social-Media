Dianne Feinstein ( CA ) and Amy Klobuchar \u2019 s ( MN ) proposals over those of Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-LA ) and Rep. John Rutherford ( R-FL ) .\nIn the televised meeting , which felt a lot like the freewheeling discussion Trump held on immigration last month , the president called for a bill that was \u201c powerful \u201d on background checks and that would address mental illness and possibly raise the age limit for buying assault rifles from 18 years old to 21 . He also repeatedly stated support for beefing up armed security at schools and getting rid of \u201c gun-free zones . \u201d\nIn all , it was an undeniable call for comprehensive gun control \u2014 something Republicans have been wary of touching .\n\u201c I like that word , comprehensive , \u201d Trump said . \u201c They say it is a bad word . I like the word . I would rather have a comprehensive bill . ... It would be really nice to create something that \u2019 s beautiful . \u201d\nWhether this discussion will actually yield legislation \u2014 and whether Trump sticks to the positions he supported in the meeting \u2014 remains to be seen .\nOnly last month , many of these same lawmakers listened to Trump publicly support compromise immigration legislation , only to have his administration derail every bipartisan proposal put forward . Trump said he wants to be the president that gets gun reform passed through Congress . It \u2019 s not yet clear if that will translate into helping Congress pass a bill .\nWhat Trump said he supports on gun control ( for now )\nAfter the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 , Congress tried and failed to pass a bipartisan gun control bill \u2014 most of which were extremely narrow proposals . This time , Congress is under mounting pressure to act , and Trump has jumped on the bandwagon of a national movement to address gun laws .\nIn the meeting , Trump articulated three main priorities for gun control , many of which were in stark contrast with his base :\nTrump supported both the Fix NICS Act , a proposal sponsored by Sens . John Cornyn ( R-TX ) and Chris Murphy ( D-CT ) that would reinforce current laws requiring state and federal agencies to report criminal records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) . The bill would increase enforcement , step up requirements for federal and state agencies to update records , give states financial incentives to report to NICS , and penalize agencies that don \u2019 t upload their records .\nHe also supported a proposal from Republican Sen. Pat Toomey ( PA ) and moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin ( WV ) that would expand the current background check system for gun sales at gun shows and online , where transactions between family members , friends , and neighbors go unchecked .\nTrump repeatedly referred to Manchin and Toomey \u2019 s proposal as a possible \u201c base \u201d to a more comprehensive gun control legislation . This proposal has failed twice in the Senate .\n2 ) Trump called for more robust checks for mental illness \u2014 even if it means confiscating guns\n\u201c You have to fix mental illness , \u201d Trump said . \u201c If someone is mentally ill , you can \u2019 t take it away . They can buy . It is ridiculous . ... I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 re going to fix it . \u201d\nThe call was met with some pushback from Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) , who warned that not all people with mental illness are a danger to others . Republicans actually made it easier for people with mental illnesses to purchase guns last year , rolling back an Obama-era regulation that required the Social Security Administration to report mental illness records to NICS .\nConservatives have raised concerns that some agencies can formally declare \u201c mental illness \u201d without due process . But Trump doesn \u2019 t appear to have those same due process concerns .\n\u201c Take the firearms first and then go to court , \u201d he said . \u201c A lot of times by the time you go to court , it takes so long to go to court , to get the due process procedures . I like taking the guns early . \u201d\n3 ) He expressed openness to raising age limits for purchasing certain assault rifles\nTrump reiterated his interest in raising the minimum age for purchasing assault rifles \u2014 which is a break from the National Rifle Association \u2019 s position and an idea House conservatives say is a nonstarter .\nCurrently , federal law prohibits anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a handgun from a licensed dealer but allows adults 18 or older to buy rifles .\n\u201c People aren \u2019 t bringing it up because they \u2019 re afraid to bring it up , \u201d Trump said of the policy . \u201c You can \u2019 t buy a handgun at 18 , 19 , or 20 . You have to wait until you \u2019 re 21 . You could buy the weapon used in this horrible shooting at 18 . You are going to decide \u2014 the people in this room pretty much are going to decide . \u201d\nTRUMP : I \u2019 m just curious as to what you did in your bill . TOOMEY : We didn \u2019 t address it , Mr. President . TRUMP : Do you know why ? You \u2019 re afraid of the NRA . TOOMEY : No . I dealt with the NRA five years ago .\nAt one point , Trump even seemed to express support for Feinstein \u2019 s assault weapons ban , telling Manchin and Toomey to add her proposal to the base bill .\nFeinstein 's reaction when Trump says she should add assault weapons ban to Manchin-Toomey pic.twitter.com/7dlKxwa1KO \u2014 Ryan Struyk ( @ ryanstruyk ) February 28 , 2018\nOutside of these main points , Trump also repeatedly spoke against \u201c gun-free zones , \u201d calling them the \u201c most dangerous \u201d places in the country , and supported \u201c offensive firepower on the inside \u201d of schools \u2014 two issues that are nonstarters for most Democrats .\nWhat Trump didn \u2019 t support in the meeting was possibly more notable .\nOn multiple occasions , he rejected proposals to include legislation that would allow permits for carrying concealed weapons to cross state lines in this gun control package \u2014 something that has been a priority for House Republicans and was part of a version of the Fix NICS bill that already passed in the lower chamber .\n\u201c I think that maybe that bill will someday pass , but it should pass as a separate , \u201d Trump said in response to Scalise , instead siding with Democrats . \u201c If you \u2019 re going to put concealed carry between states into this bill , we \u2019 re talking about a whole new ballgame . You \u2019 ll never get this passed if you add concealed carry to this , you \u2019 ll never get it passed . ... We want to get something done . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s call for comprehensive gun control legislation is a major break from what congressional Republicans have been discussing . After shootings , Republican talking points typically steer away from any actual gun control-related measures , or focus on the narrowest possible provisions .\nAlready Trump \u2019 s position has concerned his conservative supporters in the House Freedom Caucus , many of whom spent the week strategizing alternatives for him . Going down the list , Freedom Caucus members have found issue with many of Trump \u2019 s gun control positions , from the Fix NICS Act to the increased minimum purchasing age .\nTrump seems confused on why gun control hasn \u2019 t passed before\nTrump repeated a simple question during the bipartisan meeting on gun legislation : Why didn \u2019 t Congress pass gun control after the last shooting ?\nThe president would have to look to many in his own party for those answers . Following Sandy Hook , momentum behind an assault weapons ban fell short of 60 votes in the Senate after losing the support of all but one Republican and 15 Democrats .\nTrump had his own explanations for why : He said members were scared of the gun lobby and the news cycle was distracting , and he repeatedly tried to blame Obama , saying his predecessor wasn \u2019 t \u201c proactive \u201d on the issue .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s time that a president stepped up , \u201d Trump said . \u201c I \u2019 m talking Democrat and Republican presidents , they \u2019 ve not stepped up . \u201d\nObama repeatedly called for commonsense gun control reforms , including expanding background checks and addressing mental illness . When gun control failed in the Senate after Sandy Hook , he called it a \u201c pretty shameful day in Washington . \u201d\nEven Republicans in the room had to correct Trump on Obama \u2019 s role in gun control . Here \u2019 s an exchange between Trump and Toomey on why his background check expansion didn \u2019 t pass before :\nTRUMP : Do you have support for that , bipartisan support for what you \u2019 re saying ? TOOMEY : We had 54 votes in 2013 . Most of those 54 voters are still in the Senate . TRUMP : And not a lot of presidential backup ? TOOMEY : President Obama did support it . TRUMP : But that was your problem .\nFeinstein also chimed in to say Congress had \u201c tried \u201d to pass gun control in the past .\nUntil now , congressional Republicans have been reluctant to act on guns , candidly saying the urgency will die down and the policy issue will be pushed to the background . Trump , however , doesn \u2019 t seem to care where his party has stood on the issue . He wants to \u201c take the responsibility \u201d of passing gun control \u2014 and , in his view , prove he can do what earlier presidents couldn \u2019 t .",
