'' Perry asked . `` What does it look like from the streets of Paris when the president of the United States fails to show up in France after the worst terror attack in that country in decades ? `` And what does it look like from the squares in Poland , where a people so recently freed from subjugation by Russia see Putin getting away with dismembering Ukraine , and wonder if this president will act to save NATO ? `` Perry said that our allies `` see President Obama 's actions , and perhaps just as importantly , his inaction and see confusion where there should be moral clarity . Unreliability where there should be unwavering support . `` This is not the America I know , '' the former governor concluded . `` The choice we face in 2016 is whether we can endure a future that looks like the last six years . `` Our children will not inherit an America with greater opportunity when America continues to shrink from its role in the world .
