    "content": "Fears of a renewed nuclear arms race with Russia have spiked this week as the Trump administration approaches a Saturday deadline to begin officially pulling America out of a key Cold War-era weapons pact that U.S. officials say the Kremlin has flagrantly violated for years .\nWith last-ditch diplomatic attempts so far failing to resolve disputes over the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty , the administration is expected to stick to the Feb. 2 deadline for withdrawing if Russia refuses to come into compliance .\nThat starts a six-month clock for ending the treaty , and the U.S. government would no longer be bound by the INF \u2019 s blanket ban on the production of midrange nuclear weapons .\nWhile the treaty \u2019 s impending collapse has alarmed arms control advocates around the world , the Trump administration \u2019 s arguments have won major support , including from NATO and from key Republicans on Capitol Hill .\n\u201c The accord is being violated by Russia , \u201d Rep. Michael T. McCaul of Texas , the House Foreign Affairs Committee \u2019 s ranking Republican , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday . \u201c There is no reason for the United States to handcuff ourselves as Russia advances their weapons system at will . \u201d\nSenate Armed Forces Committee Chairman James M. Inhofe , Oklahoma Republican , said , \u201c It \u2019 s been 60 days since President Trump told [ Russian President ] Vladimir Putin to stop violating the INF Treaty , but Russia hasn \u2019 t taken any meaningful steps to come into compliance . It \u2019 s time to formally withdraw as we continue to consult with our partners . We can not keep jeopardizing our allies , troops and infrastructure for a one-sided treaty . \u201d\nCritics say abrogating the treaty entirely represents a leap into the unknown , with Russia and other potential rivals such as China ready to respond in kind .\nThe expected withdrawal notice follows months of warnings from the administration that it would take action if Russia continued to deploy weapons the U.S. says is not permitted by the treaty negotiated in the waning years of the Cold War by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to let them violate a nuclear agreement and do weapons and we \u2019 re not allowed to , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in October . \u201c We \u2019 re the ones that have stayed in the agreement and we \u2019 ve honored the agreement but Russia has not unfortunately honored the agreement . \u201d\nThe goal of the pact , which permanently prohibits the U.S. and Russia from building or deploying land-based missiles and launch systems with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles , was to block the spread of so-called \u201c tactical nukes \u201d around the globe , particularly in Europe , in part for fear the less powerful bombs were more likely to be used in an actual shooting war .\nAside from Russia \u2019 s violations , critics of the treaty note that countries such as China and Iran are not covered by the ban on medium-range missiles .\nIt was the Obama administration that first accused Moscow in 2014 of breaching the INF , specifically through the deployment of a cruise missile known as the Novator 9M729 .\nA Council on Foreign Relations analysis noted some experts believe Russia is cheating for a simple reason : It can \u2019 t compete with the extensive U.S. sea- and air-based nuclear arsenal , where there are no restrictions on such missiles , so it must boost its firepower on land .\nMoscow initially denied the 9M729 system \u2019 s existence , and more recently , has argued the cruise missile doesn \u2019 t violate the INF Treaty .\nIn December , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the administration would officially begin pulling the U.S. out in 60 days \u2014 by Feb. 2 \u2014 unless the Kremlin took clear steps to come back into compliance .
