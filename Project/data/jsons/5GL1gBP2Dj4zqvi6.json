And then , of course , those who endorsed him but really should have been with her \u2026 that burned her\u2026 Their spreadsheet formalized the deep knowledge of those involved in building it . Like so many of the Clinton help , Balderston and Elrod were walking favor files . They remembered nearly every bit of assistance the Clintons had given and every slight made against them . Almost six years later , most Clinton aides can still rattle off the names of traitors and the favors that had been done for them , then provide details of just how each of the guilty had gone on to betray the Clintons\u2014as if it all had happened just a few hours before . The data project ensured that the acts of the sinners and saints would never be forgotten . There was a special circle of Clinton hell reserved for people who had endorsed Obama or stayed on the fence after Bill and Hillary had raised money for them , appointed them to a political post or written a recommendation to ice their kid \u2019 s application to an elite school . On one early draft of the hit list , each Democratic member of Congress was assigned a numerical grade from 1 to 7 , with the most helpful to Hillary earning 1s and the most treacherous drawing 7s . The set of 7s included Sens . John Kerry ( D-Mass . ) , Jay Rockefeller ( D-W.Va. ) , Bob Casey ( D-Pa. ) and Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) , as well as Reps.

From HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton: \u201c\u2026they [Hillary aides Kris Balderston and Adrienne Elrod] recorded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet the names and deeds of members of Congress. They carefully noted who had endorsed Hillary, who had backed Obama, and who had stayed on the sidelines\u2014standard operating procedure for any high-end political organization. But the data went into much more nuanced detail. \u2018We wanted to have a record of who endorsed us and who didn\u2019t,\u2019 a member of Hillary\u2019s campaign team said, \u201cand of those who endorsed us, who went the extra mile and who was just kind of there. And of those who didn\u2019t endorse us, those who understandably didn\u2019t endorse us because they are [Congressional Black Caucus] members or Illinois members. And then, of course, those who endorsed him but really should have been with her \u2026 that burned her\u2026 Their spreadsheet formalized the deep knowledge of those involved in building it. Like so many of the Clinton help, Balderston and Elrod were walking favor files. They remembered nearly every bit of assistance the Clintons had given and every slight made against them. Almost six years later, most Clinton aides can still rattle off the names of traitors and the favors that had been done for them, then provide details of just how each of the guilty had gone on to betray the Clintons\u2014as if it all had happened just a few hours before. The data project ensured that the acts of the sinners and saints would never be forgotten. There was a special circle of Clinton hell reserved for people who had endorsed Obama or stayed on the fence after Bill and Hillary had raised money for them, appointed them to a political post or written a recommendation to ice their kid\u2019s application to an elite school. On one early draft of the hit list, each Democratic member of Congress was assigned a numerical grade from 1 to 7, with the most helpful to Hillary earning 1s and the most treacherous drawing 7s. The set of 7s included Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.), Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), as well as Reps. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Baron Hill (D-Ind.) and Rob Andrews (D-N.J.).\u201d\n\n[Daily Caller ponders why Bill and Hillary Clinton backed a George Soros-supported for-profit college scheme.]\n\nIRS LOOKS TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL\n\nWith the scandal from heavy-handed tactics by IRS agents against President Obama\u2019s political enemies still lingering, the Obama administration wants to make it easier for agents to crack down on similar groups. New rules are pending for the regulation of political speech by the tax-collection agency, and conservatives are crying foul. With recent election cycles showing a rise in spending by these conservative backed groups, many of them see the proposals as an infringement on their right to free speech. \u2013Watch Fox: Campaign Carl Cameron considers the impact these proposals would have on non-profit organizations in their political activities.\n\nSUNDAY SOUND ON CHRISTIE\n\nGood to go\u2026\n\n\u201c[Gov.

Bill Young, R-Fla., the rhetoric is ramping up between David Jolly and state Rep. Kathleen Peters. Jolly, a former Young staffer and lobbyist, has taken hits from Peters for providing substantial contributions to keep Democrats in office. Jolly has characterized Peters as a waffler who refuses to \u201ctake a stand\u201d for the repeal of ObamaCare. The winner of Tuesday\u2019s primary will face failed 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Alex Sink in an early March general election.

The Madison Project is opening five field offices in the Bluegrass state to organize grass roots efforts for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s challenger. McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore blasted the group\u2019s political director, Drew Ryun for recently tweeting Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was a \u201ctool.\u201d Moore told the Lexington-Herald leader, \u201cTheir genius strategy is to smear Mitch McConnell, call Rand Paul a 'tool,' and then ask Kentucky Republicans to abandon their own and support Matt Bevin.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX: THE ED FACTOR\n\nThe next 294 days will prove crucial for Democrats seeking to survive the midterm elections and still hold control of the Senate. Republicans only need to knock off six vulnerable Democrats and Fox News First wants to know who you think they are. Reader Frank Catenaccio said the entrance of former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie in Virginia\u2019s Senate race could shake things up for Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.

Harvey Whittemore, facing two years in federal prison after a jury found him guilty of political corruption charges, is asking to have his law license restored even as he awaits a ruling on his appeal of the conviction. One of those speaking on his behalf, a retired federal judge appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, told the disciplinary board: \u201cI knew Mr. Whittemore was always supporting political candidates and, I don\u2019t mean to be pejorative, but I\u2019m sure Harry Reid was always out there with his hand out.\u201d The Reno Gazette-Journal has the story.\n\nWALKER WINS FREE SPEECH VICTORY\n\nA Wisconsin judge last week threw out subpoenas in secret \u201cJohn Doe\u201d probes by Democratic prosecutors decried as partisan intimidation tactics by supporters of Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis. WSJ opines: \u201cThis means that prosecutors essentially invented without evidence the possibility of criminal behavior to justify the subpoenas and their thuggish tactics. At least three targets had their homes raided at dawn, with police turning over belongings, seizing computers and files, and even barring phone calls\u2026 The judge\u2019s order vindicates our suspicion that the John Doe probe is a political operation intended to shut up Mr. Walker\u2019s allies as he seeks re-election this year\u2026 The John Doe process has become a political weapon intended to serve partisan ends regardless of the law. Kudos to a judge who was brave enough to read the law and stop it, but there\u2019s more free-speech defending to do.\u201d\n\n[Is that you, Donald Rumsfeld? - For sale in Friday\u2019s WaPo classified section: \u201c55th Inauguration Cufflinks\u2026 George Bush January 20th, 2005\u2026\u201d The asking price from an unnamed seller in Anne Arundel County, Md.: $75]\n\nDIDN\u2019T GET AMAZON PRIME\u2026\n\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station just received their delivery of Christmas presents. Numerous delays including repairs to a cooling system, cold weather and a solar storm delayed the launch of the gift-bearing Cygnus capsule until late last week. Cygnus is more significant than just being the delayed bearer of Christmas goodies and fresh food to the six crew members \u2013three Russians, two Americans, and one Japanese \u2013 it is the first ever resupply mission by a private contractor. Under the current NASA structure, the United States has ceded space flight operations to Russia and to domestic private contractors, like Virginia-based Orbital Sciences, which carried out the Cygnus launch.
