David Barno , a three-star general who commanded US troops in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 . \u201c The bad news is that it narrows the field , in my view , of diverse opinions \u2013 maybe more than is advisable . \u201d\nIt is a concern that the Trump transition team has acknowledged , particularly given that Mattis would be the second retired general tapped to serve in the administration , and Trump is said to be eying a third .\nHe has named a former three-star general who clashed with the Obama administration , Michael Flynn , as his national security advisor . The president-elect is also said to be considering for secretary of State retired four-star Gen. David Petraeus , who formerly ran both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the CIA \u2013 before being forced to resign after being convicted of mishandling classified documents .\n\u201c It begins to look like Chile in the 1970s , \u201d one source advising the Trump team told U.S. News & World Report .\nThose sorts of unpleasant optics \u2013 of a kind that imply military dictatorship , or at least heavy rule \u2013 were anticipated by Congress , which has a law in place restricting retired military officers from serving as secretary of Defense for a period of seven years after leaving active duty . Anything less requires a waiver from Congress .\nMattis , who retired in March 2013 , has been out for less than four years . There has been one exception made to this law in US history , when President Harry Truman appointed former Secretary of State and retired Gen. George Marshall to serve as secretary of Defense in 1950 .\n\u201c Congress must not take any changes to this law lightly , even if they simply amount to carving out an exception for Gen. Mattis , \u201d the left-leaning Center for American Progress said in a statement . \u201c This law exists to preserve civilian control of the military , a cornerstone of American democracy . \u201d\nIt was a warning echoed this week by lawmakers as well . Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) of New York , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee ( SASC ) , noted that while she \u201c deeply \u201d respects Mattis \u2019 s service , she will oppose a waiver . \u201c Civilian control is a fundamental principle of American democracy , and I will not vote for an exception to this rule , \u201d she said in a statement issued Thursday evening .\nThe SASC committee chairman , Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona and a former Vietnam Navy fighter pilot and prisoner of war , was not as concerned . \u201c I look forward to moving forward with the confirmation process as soon as possible in the new Congress , \u201d he said in his statement calling Mattis \u201c without a doubt one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops . \u201d\nMattis \u2019 s salty Marine persona , complete with generous smatterings of profanity , is the stuff of Internet meme legend . \u201c Be polite , be professional , but have a plan to kill everybody you meet , \u201d is one of his tamer exhortations from his Iraq command days . On fighting the Taliban , including \u201c guys who slap women around for five years because they don \u2019 t wear a veil , \u201d he said : \u201c Guys like that ain \u2019 t got no manhood left anyway .
