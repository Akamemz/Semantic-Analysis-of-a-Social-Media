A deputy inspector general has been active in recent years , but the department \u2019 s top watchdog post , tasked with investigating practices at roughly 260 embassies worldwide , has been vacant for more than five years .\nA spokesman for office of inspector general said Tuesday that the probe into \u201c allegations of quashing \u201d by State Department higher-ups was triggered by a 2012 office of inspector general review of the department \u2019 s Bureau of Diplomatic Security .\nThat review uncovered complaints by some officials that they were not allowed to thoroughly investigate the allegations of criminal activity . As a result , the office of inspector general has hired independent law enforcement specialists to examine the complaints and the extent to which investigators within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security are being allowed the level of independence required to do their jobs effectively .\nIn addition to reviewing \u201c eight allegations of criminal misconduct \u201d that arose during the 2012 review , Doug Welty , a spokesman for the office of inspector general , said the office is \u201c also looking into the allegations of quashing . \u201d\nMr. Welty made the remarks as Undersecretary of State Patrick F. Kennedy issued a statement to reporters Tuesday saying he has \u201c never once interfered , nor would I condone interfering , in any investigation . \u201d\nMr. Welty and others at the State Department have declined to comment on the specific allegations related to \u201c quashing . \u201d\nBut Mr. Kennedy apparently made the statement in response to the CBS News report this week that insinuated that he was involved in suppressing an investigation into the activities of a U.S. ambassador accused of patronizing prostitutes in a public park .\nCiting \u201c sources , \u201d CBS News reported that after the accusation surfaced , the ambassador was called to Washington to meet with Mr. Kennedy , but then was permitted to return to his post .\nCBS also reported that officials from the State Department \u2019 s Bureau of Diplomatic Security told the office of inspector general that they were told to stop investigating the case .\nThe State Department has vigorously rejected the CBS report . A senior spokeswoman called it \u201c preposterous \u201d to claim the department would not vigorously investigate allegations of criminal misconduct .\nDepartment officials have remained vague , however , about the details of the allegations in question .\nAs spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki refused Tuesday to confirm or deny whether a U.S. ambassador had been accused of patronizing prostitutes , U.S . Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman emailed an abrupt statement to reporters , saying he was \u201c angered and saddened \u201d by \u201c baseless allegations that have appeared in the press . \u201d\n\u201c I live on a beautiful park in Brussels that you walk through to get to many locations , and at no point have I ever engaged in any improper activity , \u201d Mr. Gutman said in the statement .\n\u201c To watch the four years I have proudly served in Belgium smeared is devastating , \u201d he said .\nThe ambassador \u2019 s denial appeared to represent the first official acknowledgment of the various allegations of criminal activity cited in the CBS News report .\nAccording to the Center For Responsive Politics , Mr. Gutman was a key Obama fundraiser in 2008 , bundling at least $ 775,000 for the president \u2019 s campaign and the Inaugural Committee .\nA separate allegation was reportedly made against a State Department security official in Beirut accused of sexually assaulting foreign nationals hired as embassy guards . In another , members of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s security detail were accused of regularly pursuing prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries . Another referenced a suspected illegal narcotics ring tied to State Department contractors at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad .\nWhen pressed for details Tuesday about the cases and an explanation as to whether Mr. Gutman has been cleared from the allegations made against him , Ms. Psaki responded that \u201c there are some investigations that are still ongoing , some that have been concluded . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to break down individual cases , \u201d she said , adding that all of the allegations in question were \u201c unsubstantiated . \u201d\nOne State Department official said that the allegations of criminal activity as well as the allegations of quashing by department higher-ups may have been born out of an anonymous survey given to officials in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security as part of the office of inspector general \u2019 s 2012 review of the bureau \u2019 s activities . \u201c One of the first things they do is a survey , sent out to employees , contractors , etc. , \u201d the official said . \u201c It \u2019 s all confidential and sometimes these issues come up . Then , these same people who filled out the survey have an opportunity to speak to inspectors confidentially and sometimes that \u2019 s when the allegations come up .\n\u201c Allegations are allegations , \u201d the official added . \u201c Not until they can be substantiated and verified do they become findings . \u201d\nThe situation is drawing increasing attention , meanwhile , on Capitol Hill , where lawmakers from both sides of the isle have begun expressing concern .\n\u201c I am appalled not only at the reported misconduct itself , but at the reported interference in the investigations of the misconduct , \u201d said Rep.
