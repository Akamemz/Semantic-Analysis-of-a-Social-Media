    "content": "Why would Trump randomly begin his morning by launching a sudden attack on transgender Americans whom he pledged repeatedly to fight for on the campaign trail ? Perhaps because he thought they were standing between him and the thing he wants more than anything in the world : funding for his precious border wall . Politico writes :\nHouse Republicans were planning to pass a spending bill stacked with his campaign promises , including money to build his border wall with Mexico . But an internal House Republican fight over transgender troops was threatening to blow up the bill . And House GOP insiders feared they might not have the votes to pass the legislation because defense hawks wanted a ban on Pentagon-funded sex reassignment operations \u2014 something GOP leaders wouldn \u2019 t give them . They turned to Trump , who didn \u2019 t hesitate . In the flash of a tweet , he announced that transgender troops would be banned altogether .\nAnother rash and desperate decision by Trump on a policy he 's barely considered and knows probably nothing about . How much money are we talking about here ? A Rand Corporation study found annual military spending on transgender medical care would amount to $ 8.4 million on the high end out of a total medical budget of $ 6.2 billion . That 's what so-called `` defense hawks '' are obsessing about , when the military spends $ 41.6 million on Viagra . Who are these jokers ?\nSo Trump wakes up , has a cup of coffee and figures , if I end transgender service , problem solved on the spending bill ! Right ? Mark my words , Trump has no idea the can of worms he has just opened because he 's incapable of drawing causal connections between his actions and the many different consequences they can have\u2014especially the unintended ones .\nNowhere was that more clear than at Wednesday 's White House briefing , where Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was so flustered by the number of questions hurled at her about Trump 's new transgender policy pronouncement , she threatened to shut down the briefing .\n`` I really do n't have anything else to add on that topic , '' she said after fielding about 10 minutes of questions . `` If those are the only questions we have , I 'm going to call it a day .
