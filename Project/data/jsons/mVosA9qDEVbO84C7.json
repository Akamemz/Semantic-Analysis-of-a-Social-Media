    "content": "With ideological extremism on the rise in Congress , President Barack Obama argued during his State of the Union that America must reform its elections .\n`` If we want a better politics , it \u2019 s not enough to just change a congressman or a senator or even a president , '' Obama said . `` We have to change the system to reflect our better selves . ''\nObama was less clear on how , exactly , America might pull this off . The president criticized gerrymandering \u2014 the process by which parties draw oddly shaped , highly partisan congressional districts \u2014 and called for campaign finance reform and repealing restrictions to voter access .\nThese reforms , however , have gone nowhere . In the meantime , the incentives have only increased for politicians to stake out maximalist positions , with little structural reward for moderates who anger their bases .\nIt raises the question : Does anybody out there have a better idea ?\nThe plan : bring back at-large representatives for the House of Representatives\nAnne Kim , a policy editor at Washington Monthly and a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute , has proposed a new way to help fight polarization of Congress .\nIn an essay published in the winter 2016 issue of Democracy , Kim calls for the creation of one `` at-large '' congressional seat in every state , chosen by voters statewide .\nWe currently determine our House seats by slicing up a state 's map into a bunch of different smaller segments , except for states with very small populations that only get one at-large representative .

These plans envision treating the representatives as one at-large group , to be doled out proportionately after a statewide vote .\nKim 's proposal is more modest and perhaps more practical . By only asking for states to add one at-large seat , the plan preserves the benefits of the basic idea without requiring a wholesale transformation of how we conduct congressional elections .\nFederal and state law would have to be changed to make it possible . But doing so , Kim says , would likely create several dozen House seats that are by definition not gerrymandered \u2014 and , as a result , are more responsive to the actual demands of their constituents .\n`` This seems like a simple and easy-to-understand mechanism to get moderate Americans a little more excited about a way for their voices to actually be heard , '' Kim says .\nWhy statewide House races might lead to more moderates in Congress\nVoters across a state are significantly more moderate than those in a gerrymandered district . Having a bloc of House members picked through statewide elections , Kim says , would make it at least more likely that there 's an institutional incentive for politicians to move to the center .\n`` The creation of new 'plurality-moderate ' at-large seats in many states would increase the number of competitive seats while bolstering the odds for moderate candidates , '' Kim writes in her Democracy essay . `` Challenging the status quo might be an excellent and concrete opportunity to test moderate muscle .

I 'm not sure the GOP has gotten any favors by allowing that wing of the party to get as powerful as it has been , '' Kim says .\nShe added : `` If the GOP has learned anything about reasserting the power of the establishment , this is certainly the way to do it .

For one thing , we already have 50 at-large districts \u2014 states \u2014 and the Senate is just as polarized as the House , '' said Morris Fiorina , a political science professor at Stanford University who has done extensive research on polarization .\nAmerican politics is moving inexorably to the margins , and even in a statewide vote the candidate will have to win a primary , Fiorina noted . In other words , there 's just not much reason to believe gerrymandering is the main culprit here .\n`` Single-member or at-large , safe district or competitive , the candidate has to win a primary dominated by the wingnuts , '' Fiorina said .\nMatthew Dickinson , a professor of political science at Middlebury College , had a more measured response to the idea .
