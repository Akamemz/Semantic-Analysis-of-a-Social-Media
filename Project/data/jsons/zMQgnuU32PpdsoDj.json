A dissident who participated in his country \u2019 s Velvet Revolution in 1989 , which helped bring the Soviet era to a close here , Mr. Topol has pursued a more low-key task in recent years . He accepted a job as program director at the V\u00e1clav Havel Library at the late president \u2019 s request shortly before he died in 2011 to keep alive the legacy of their defining victory over communism \u2013 and buoy dissidents in the world \u2019 s remaining authoritarian regimes .\nTopol , a leading literary figure of his generation who was jailed for his samizdat writings during the upheaval , says that the new job at first felt disconnected from daily Czech life in the 21st century . \u201c I sometimes would talk to students about the Velvet Revolution and have the feeling I was talking about the times of Julius Caesar , \u201d he says in a smoky , book-lined cafe in Prague filled with students dissecting French philosophy and friends talking politics and weekend plans .\nNow , just over a year since Russia annexed Ukraine \u2019 s Crimea , his work has turned uncomfortably relevant : At least once a month the library invites Ukrainian dissidents to give talks . \u201c Now it \u2019 s back , \u201d he says . \u201c Now everything is about Russia . \u201d\nFrom Warsaw to Budapest , Sofia to Prague , people all across the former East bloc are looking uneasily at Russia to see how far President Vladimir Putin will push his more adventurous foreign policy and his new pique with the West .\nNo one expects an imminent invasion . No one expects any change in allegiances between East and West . The former Soviet satellites that are members of the European Union today eagerly joined the West bloc , most in May 2004 , and enthusiastically became members of NATO before that . Residents in these countries , across all generations , say they feel fully European and bristle when even asked where their loyalties lie .\nBut feelings across the region are hardly monolithic . Many people have thrown their support behind populist leaders , such as Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman or Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n , who have courted Moscow and voiced contempt for EU actions . Others are defecting to fringe parties that are even more emphatic in their alliances with Moscow and their distrust of the EU .\nIn many ways their discontent mirrors the questioning going on among all EU members at a time of economic malaise . But the disenchantment in Central Europe is particularly jarring , given the euphoria that the countries felt at the outset of their democratic transformation just a generation ago . Driven by the limits of democratic and economic progress , their restiveness is also more dangerous because their democracies are younger and because of the history of the Soviet occupation and nationalism that predates the 20th century . All this ambivalence , what \u2019 s been called \u201c transformation fatigue , \u201d has slowly been taking root for years but has now been exposed by the crisis in Ukraine .\n\u201c Basically I think that it \u2019 s really the first time since 1989 that we \u2019 ve started a discussion about do we really belong to the West and what the West really is , \u201d says Ondrej Soukup , a Czech journalist who covers Russia and the former Soviet satellites for the financial daily Hospod\u00e1rsk\u00e9 Noviny , which in April ran a 13-page special with a front-page headline asking \u201c Are we afraid of Russia ? \u201d The West isn \u2019 t the same place it once was , when the EU was smaller and less politically entwined and NATO had more relevance , he argues . \u201c One of the most powerful slogans during the Velvet Revolution was \u2018 Back to Europe \u2019 .... Today that \u2019 s not as easy to say as it used to be 25 years ago . \u201d\nWith their distinct cultural histories and political experiences with Soviet occupation , the former Soviet satellites and republics are hard to categorize . But broadly speaking , in the Baltic countries ( Lithuania , Latvia , Estonia ) and Poland the fear of Russia never dissipated , even as these countries joined the EU and the security of NATO . If Mr. Putin were ever to repeat his actions in Ukraine under the pretext of protecting a Russian-speaking population in the EU , many people in the Baltics fear it would be in their countries . That has kept their geopolitical alignment with the West clear .\nBut in the former central and southern states of the East bloc , Russia had , until recently , felt very far away . That distance is one reason allegiances in these countries are so malleable . The Czech Republic is typical of these swing states . For some people , Moscow still instills profound fear , while for others the memory of occupation has been replaced by modern realities \u2013 the potential of Russia \u2019 s consumer market and its provision of vast energy supplies . The country in this group that has moved the closest to Moscow is Hungary , which is all the more troubling to the West because , if anything , its populace has even fewer sympathies for Putin than those elsewhere in the region .\nSuch divided loyalties start at the very top of the power structure in Budapest . When the Hungarian prime minister visited Kazakhstan this spring , he did more than try to expand economic ties . He left behind a glimpse of his thinking about East and West : \u201c It is a rather strange feeling , \u201d Mr. Orb\u00e1n was quoted as telling his hosts , \u201c that one must travel to the East to feel at home . \u201d\nWhen Hungary emerged from communist rule with its more open form of socialism , dubbed \u201c goulash communism \u201d \u2013 which drew Czech teens to Budapest in the 1980s to buy the bluejeans that weren \u2019 t available in Prague \u2013 it was considered in the vanguard of East bloc countries . Orb\u00e1n himself was a symbol of hope : He gave a riveting anti-Soviet speech in 1989 , calling for the ouster of Red Army troops . He brought Hungary into NATO during his first term in power in the 1990s .\nTwenty-five years later , Orb\u00e1n shocked the West when he said last summer that he aims to create an \u201c illiberal democracy \u201d in Hungary , holding up Russia as one exemplary model . Since winning a second term in 2010 and a third in 2014 , the prime minister has imposed new restrictions on the media , civic groups , and the judiciary , essentially limiting checks and balances across the system .\nOrb\u00e1n is dismissed as a populist who has swapped democratic ideals for power . But part of his ability to consolidate authority flows from the discontent citizens have with the pace of change in the country . Many residents look at Austria and other Western European nations and wonder why they are not as prosperous as some of their EU brethren . Instead , Hungary has one of the lowest gross domestic products per capita in the EU .\n\u201c Many people became poor and unemployed after the first free elections , \u201d says Attila Tibor Nagy , a political analyst at Meltanyossag , a think tank in Budapest . \u201c In many people \u2019 s minds , democracy is not connected with high living standards . \u201d\nHe says this had made Hungarians , if not allies of Putin , then not automatic boosters of democratic values , either . This , in a country that still views Moscow through the brutal lens of the 1956 Hungarian uprising .\nIn the middle of Freedom Square in central Budapest , a leafy oasis whose monuments depict the country \u2019 s troubled fate in the center of 20th-century power struggles , a man takes a break from his job in a government agency .\nHe sits with his back to the Red Army \u2019 s monument to the \u201c liberation \u201d of Hungary at the time . He bristles in the shadow of the statue , which has been the target of vandalism over the years . While most of the Soviet-era memorials in Hungary were relegated to a \u201c statue park \u201d outside the city , this one stands prominently in the center of Budapest .\n\u201c It is ridiculous that it stands here , \u201d says the man , who is so reluctant to talk that he takes the battery out of his cellphone before agreeing to say anything . \u201c It belongs with the rest of them . \u201d\nAnd yet , the joy he felt at the fall of communism , and later when Hungary joined the EU \u2013 to which he still agrees Hungary should belong \u2013 has been replaced by a deep sense of disappointment . Life for many of his family and friends , he says , is a struggle that joining the EU has not remedied . He sees the 28-state union as an institution that meddles in domestic affairs for its own gain . When Orb\u00e1n hosted Putin in Budapest in February \u2013 a rare visit for the Russian president to an EU member country \u2013 the government employee agrees it was not a friendly gesture to the EU . \u201c But the question no one is asking is whether we can afford not to accept [ Putin ] , \u201d he says .\nHis attitude reflects the two currents coursing across the region . John Shattuck , the president of Central European University , a graduate school in Budapest , calls it ironic that the university is about to celebrate its 25th anniversary . In 1991 , Hungary and the rest of Central Europe were buzzing with promise about the changes to come . The demand for democracy and Western orientation is still here , he believes . And yet , in a superficial sense , \u201c the Putin illiberalism can be appealing to some in Eastern Europe who are looking for solutions to their problems , \u201d says Mr. Shattuck , who was the US ambassador to the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2000 .\nThe two narratives collide in the Czech Republic as well . High over the hilltop of the Czech capital sits Prague Castle , where Mr. Zeman resides . His role is largely ceremonial , but as president \u2013 the first popularly elected one in the Czech Republic \u2013 he helps shape the image of the nation abroad .\nThe fiery leader got into a rare public spat with the US ambassador to the Czech Republic , Andrew Schapiro , who raised questions on local television about the Czech president \u2019 s plans to attend Moscow \u2019 s mega-victory parade in May , which other EU leaders had promised to boycott . Zeman , who in the end decided not to go , nonetheless shot back : \u201c I won \u2019 t let any ambassador have a say about my foreign travels. \u201d He then said the door to Prague Castle was closed to Ambassador Schapiro .\nZeman , whose words have received condemnation across the political spectrum , was pelted with eggs during the 25th-anniversary celebration of the Velvet Revolution last November . Around Prague , a favorite topic of conversation is what \u2019 s behind the president \u2019 s erratic leadership style . Still , his words can influence the public mood , and in some ways the country \u2019 s relationship with Russia is more nuanced than Hungary \u2019 s .\nPetr Kratochvil , director of the Institute of International Relations in Prague , says the political leanings in the Czech Republic mirror those of Germany , where right-leaning politicians , such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel , take a more hawkish view of Russia , while leftists perceive it as a potential market and strategic partner .\nThe Communist Party also enjoys significant support here , as much as 15 percent , which is unseen in neighboring countries and colors the national debate . As the party faithful wrapped up their annual May Day meeting in a damp drizzle in Prague , longtime Communist Party member Jiri Stary , a lawyer , stated clearly that Europe can \u2019 t \u2013 and shouldn \u2019 t try to \u2013 stand up to the \u201c Russian bear. \u201d He supports both Zeman and Putin . \u201c They are clever men , \u201d he said .\nSometimes , romantic notions of Pan-Slavism are invoked to justify modern views of Russia , which is possible because Czechs didn \u2019 t experience the same levels of violence during the Soviet occupation as other countries did , nor did they face imperial Russia before that .\n\u201c There is no long-term historic , centuries-old grievances . The archenemies were not Russians but Germans , \u201d Mr. Kratochvil says . \u201c In Poland , it is so easy to evoke this ancient image of Russia as the enemy . In the Czech context you can \u2019 t really do that . \u201d\nAt the same time , the Czech experience mirrors frustrations in the rest of the region about the lack of prosperity and properly functioning public institutions . Residents of Central Europe have lost patience with the transition to more Western-style economic and political models , which has given a boost to autocrats and populists . Some are looking backward and thinking , \u201c It wasn \u2019 t so bad 25 years ago , \u201d says Martin Ehl , foreign editor at Hospod\u00e1rsk\u00e9 Noviny .\nThat applies to those who barely remember the era , such as 40-year-old Frantisek Hermann , a call-center employee leaving a mall in a middle-class residential neighborhood of Prague with his girlfriend on a quiet Sunday . He says he is against Putin but equally against Brussels . \u201c The EU is bad for us , \u201d he says flatly .\nPetr Pithart , who was the prime minister from 1990 to 1992 of then-Czechoslovakia , sees a specifically Czech and historical driver of current discontent : a failure to understand the realities of the Velvet Revolution .\nA signatory of Charter 77 \u2013 the manifesto drawn up by Czech writers and intellectuals demanding that the communist government recognize basic human rights \u2013 Mr. Pithart has long said the Velvet Revolution wasn \u2019 t a revolution at all in the way it is celebrated in the national consciousness . It was a handover of power that was neither risky nor revolutionary .\n\u201c A revolution is connected with hopes and the will for deep substantial changes for the better , \u201d he says . \u201c If you interpret it as a handing over of power , you have to be much more skeptical and cautious . \u201d\nThe more dominant view among people is that the Velvet Revolution put the country courageously on the right path . At a recent dinner at his house , Mr. Ehl puts on the punk rock song \u201c Marilyn Monroe , \u201d which typifies the underground arts movement that formed the backbone of the Velvet Revolution . Ehl and his wife , as well as friends visiting from Moravia , all of whom were teens at the time , say the song is one almost everyone in their generation knows . While they may no longer listen to the music , they still rally around its symbolism . They all agree their lives are much better today .\nBut Pithart believes it is precisely this perpetuated narrative , which doesn \u2019 t allow expectations to be realistically aligned , that lies behind much of the disillusionment . The result , as he sees it , is a country drifting Eastward . \u201c It is not exactly sympathy to Putin , \u201d he says , \u201c but a general move from Western ideals and a Western way of politics as something too demanding \u2013 a premature weariness of democracy . \u201d\nThis has manifold consequences for each country , from its tolerance for corruption and the consolidation of power to its foreign-policy positions . On global issues , if the Czech Republic appears ambivalent from the outside , it is less so up close , since the country has a stronger democratic system and a clearer stance on Russia .\nDespite Zeman \u2019 s rhetoric , for example , the government sets the foreign-policy agenda and has voted consistently with the EU on sanctions against Russia , even when it \u2019 s been a \u201c tough sell \u201d to the public , says Jakub Kulh\u00e1nek , Czech Republic \u2019 s deputy minister of foreign affairs . \u201c Both the prime minister and the foreign minister have stated loud and clear that what is essential with respect to the conflict in Ukraine is that the EU is able to speak with one voice , \u201d he says in his office , just uphill from Prague Castle .\nOrb\u00e1n has voted with the EU on sanctions against Russia , too \u2013 in part under pressure from larger European governments such as Germany , a top trading partner . But when it comes to Russia \u2019 s influence in Europe , Putin has found new ways in despite the sanctions regime , such as a $ 12 billion loan for a nuclear energy deal in Hungary . Dubbed Paks 2 , the deal will see Russia build two nuclear reactors south of Budapest along the Danube River .\nThe project has been garnering criticism from inside and outside Hungary at a time when the EU says it is trying to lessen its dependence on Russian energy . Zoltan Illes , a member of Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s Fidesz party who doesn \u2019 t support the prime minister , says it amounts to Russia buying influence in Hungary . \u201c This has nothing to do with energy issues , \u201d he says . \u201c This is completely global politics . \u201d\nThe government dismisses those claims , saying it \u2019 s a good deal for Hungary \u2019 s energy security . It points out the vast amount of trade the rest of Europe does with Russia \u2013 far more than Hungary does with Russia . \u201c I have to state that our Paks 2 project was never , never , ever influenced by international politics , \u201d says Attila Asz\u00f3di , Hungary \u2019 s commissioner responsible for the project .\nOrb\u00e1n \u2019 s position on Russia has cost him some support , much of which , ironically for the West , has gone to the far-right Jobbik party . It is positioning itself as one of Europe \u2019 s anti-EU alternatives \u2013 and makes no qualms about its pro-Russia stance that is above all nationalist .\nJobbik lawmaker M\u00e1rton Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si , from his spacious office along the Danube , talks eloquently about the country \u2019 s East-West identity . Today Budapest might look European , he says , but if you probe deeper the Eastern influence will be revealed , from poetry to Hungarian mythological tales . \u201c The Hungarian collective conscience is absolutely Eastern , \u201d he says .\nJobbik arose as a nationalist party that was notorious for its anti-Semitic , anti-Roma rhetoric , but lately it has sought to burnish its image and fashion a pro-sovereignty message . And some of that includes the right to align with Russia . Mr. Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si calls NATO \u201c an aggressive war machine \u201d on the issue of Ukraine that works against Hungary \u2019 s interests , while he says that the EU as a notion feels like \u201c them \u201d and not \u201c us. \u201d \u201c I would love to see the European Union as \u2018 us. \u2019 But Brussels has done a lot in the last couple of years for European citizens not to view it as a common project that works for interests of the European nations . \u201d\nStill , disgruntlement with the West is hardly universal . The latest Eurobarometer poll shows the number of Hungarians who feel they are EU citizens markedly increased to 67 percent , up eight percentage points from the spring of 2014 .\nThe same is clear in the Czech Republic . In fact , this spring , when a NATO convoy rolled through the region , including the Czech Republic , many thought it was going to be widely boycotted and even booed , says Erik Tabery , editor in chief of the weekly Respekt , founded by dissident journalists in 1989 . Instead thousands came out in support of the troops . \u201c Czechs are not pro-American , \u201d Mr. Tabery says . \u201c But it was a moment of wake-up . People want to show the world we are not on the side of the Kremlin . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nTopol concurs that people in Central Europe instinctively want to be part of the West . As he explains it , with a bit of writerly wryness :\n\u201c Look , if you go to the dentist and the dentist were to say , \u2018 I have this new machine from Russia , \u2019 you \u2019 d say , \u2018 oh , no , \u2019 \u201d he says , gripping his jaw . \u201c But if he were to say , \u2018 Look , I have this new machine from the US or Germany , \u2019 you \u2019 d say , \u2018 oh interesting , do it . \u2019 \u201d",

But Western diplomats and Hungary-watchers took note: If few care about Budapest\u2019s relationship with Kazakhstan, they do care about Hungary\u2019s drift Eastward, especially into the orbit of Moscow.\n\nWhen Hungary emerged from communist rule with its more open form of socialism, dubbed \u201cgoulash communism\u201d \u2013 which drew Czech teens to Budapest in the 1980s to buy the bluejeans that weren\u2019t available in Prague \u2013 it was considered in the vanguard of East bloc countries.

Still, his words can influence the public mood, and in some ways the country\u2019s relationship with Russia is more nuanced than Hungary\u2019s.\n\nPetr Kratochvil, director of the Institute of International Relations in Prague, says the political leanings in the Czech Republic mirror those of Germany, where right-leaning politicians, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, take a more hawkish view of Russia, while leftists perceive it as a potential market and strategic partner.\n\nThe Communist Party also enjoys significant support here, as much as 15 percent, which is unseen in neighboring countries and colors the national debate. As the party faithful wrapped up their annual May Day meeting in a damp drizzle in Prague, longtime Communist Party member Jiri Stary, a lawyer, stated clearly that Europe can\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t try to \u2013 stand up to the \u201cRussian bear.\u201d He supports both Zeman and Putin. \u201cThey are clever men,\u201d he said.\n\nSometimes, romantic notions of Pan-Slavism are invoked to justify modern views of Russia, which is possible because Czechs didn\u2019t experience the same levels of violence during the Soviet occupation as other countries did, nor did they face imperial Russia before that.\n\n\u201cThere is no long-term historic, centuries-old grievances. The archenemies were not Russians but Germans,\u201d Mr. Kratochvil says. \u201cIn Poland, it is so easy to evoke this ancient image of Russia as the enemy. In the Czech context you can\u2019t really do that.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Czech experience mirrors frustrations in the rest of the region about the lack of prosperity and properly functioning public institutions. Residents of Central Europe have lost patience with the transition to more Western-style economic and political models, which has given a boost to autocrats and populists. Some are looking backward and thinking, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad 25 years ago,\u201d says Martin Ehl, foreign editor at Hospod\u00e1rsk\u00e9 Noviny.\n\nThat applies to those who barely remember the era, such as 40-year-old Frantisek Hermann, a call-center employee leaving a mall in a middle-class residential neighborhood of Prague with his girlfriend on a quiet Sunday. He says he is against Putin but equally against Brussels. \u201cThe EU is bad for us,\u201d he says flatly.\n\nPetr Pithart, who was the prime minister from 1990 to 1992 of then-Czechoslovakia, sees a specifically Czech and historical driver of current discontent: a failure to understand the realities of the Velvet Revolution.\n\nA signatory of Charter 77 \u2013 the manifesto drawn up by Czech writers and intellectuals demanding that the communist government recognize basic human rights \u2013 Mr. Pithart has long said the Velvet Revolution wasn\u2019t a revolution at all in the way it is celebrated in the national consciousness. It was a handover of power that was neither risky nor revolutionary.\n\n\u201cA revolution is connected with hopes and the will for deep substantial changes for the better,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you interpret it as a handing over of power, you have to be much more skeptical and cautious.\u201d\n\nThe more dominant view among people is that the Velvet Revolution put the country courageously on the right path. At a recent dinner at his house, Mr. Ehl puts on the punk rock song \u201cMarilyn Monroe,\u201d which typifies the underground arts movement that formed the backbone of the Velvet Revolution. Ehl and his wife, as well as friends visiting from Moravia, all of whom were teens at the time, say the song is one almost everyone in their generation knows. While they may no longer listen to the music, they still rally around its symbolism. They all agree their lives are much better today.\n\nBut Pithart believes it is precisely this perpetuated narrative, which doesn\u2019t allow expectations to be realistically aligned, that lies behind much of the disillusionment. The result, as he sees it, is a country drifting Eastward. \u201cIt is not exactly sympathy to Putin,\u201d he says, \u201cbut a general move from Western ideals and a Western way of politics as something too demanding \u2013 a premature weariness of democracy.\u201d\n\nThis has manifold consequences for each country, from its tolerance for corruption and the consolidation of power to its foreign-policy positions. On global issues, if the Czech Republic appears ambivalent from the outside, it is less so up close, since the country has a stronger democratic system and a clearer stance on Russia.\n\nDespite Zeman\u2019s rhetoric, for example, the government sets the foreign-policy agenda and has voted consistently with the EU on sanctions against Russia, even when it\u2019s been a \u201ctough sell\u201d to the public, says Jakub Kulh\u00e1nek, Czech Republic\u2019s deputy minister of foreign affairs. \u201cBoth the prime minister and the foreign minister have stated loud and clear that what is essential with respect to the conflict in Ukraine is that the EU is able to speak with one voice,\u201d he says in his office, just uphill from Prague Castle.\n\nOrb\u00e1n has voted with the EU on sanctions against Russia, too \u2013 in part under pressure from larger European governments such as Germany, a top trading partner. But when it comes to Russia\u2019s influence in Europe, Putin has found new ways in despite the sanctions regime, such as a $12 billion loan for a nuclear energy deal in Hungary. Dubbed Paks 2, the deal will see Russia build two nuclear reactors south of Budapest along the Danube River.\n\nThe project has been garnering criticism from inside and outside Hungary at a time when the EU says it is trying to lessen its dependence on Russian energy. Zoltan Illes, a member of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party who doesn\u2019t support the prime minister, says it amounts to Russia buying influence in Hungary. \u201cThis has nothing to do with energy issues,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is completely global politics.\u201d\n\nThe government dismisses those claims, saying it\u2019s a good deal for Hungary\u2019s energy security. It points out the vast amount of trade the rest of Europe does with Russia \u2013 far more than Hungary does with Russia. \u201cI have to state that our Paks 2 project was never, never, ever influenced by international politics,\u201d says Attila Asz\u00f3di, Hungary\u2019s commissioner responsible for the project.\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s position on Russia has cost him some support, much of which, ironically for the West, has gone to the far-right Jobbik party. It is positioning itself as one of Europe\u2019s anti-EU alternatives \u2013 and makes no qualms about its pro-Russia stance that is above all nationalist.\n\nJobbik lawmaker M\u00e1rton Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si, from his spacious office along the Danube, talks eloquently about the country\u2019s East-West identity. Today Budapest might look European, he says, but if you probe deeper the Eastern influence will be revealed, from poetry to Hungarian mythological tales. \u201cThe Hungarian collective conscience is absolutely Eastern,\u201d he says.\n\nJobbik arose as a nationalist party that was notorious for its anti-Semitic, anti-Roma rhetoric, but lately it has sought to burnish its image and fashion a pro-sovereignty message. And some of that includes the right to align with Russia. Mr. Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si calls NATO \u201can aggressive war machine\u201d on the issue of Ukraine that works against Hungary\u2019s interests, while he says that the EU as a notion feels like \u201cthem\u201d and not \u201cus.\u201d \u201cI would love to see the European Union as \u2018us.\u2019 But Brussels has done a lot in the last couple of years for European citizens not to view it as a common project that works for interests of the European nations.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nStill, disgruntlement with the West is hardly universal. The latest Eurobarometer poll shows the number of Hungarians who feel they are EU citizens markedly increased to 67 percent, up eight percentage points from the spring of 2014.\n\nThe same is clear in the Czech Republic. In fact, this spring, when a NATO convoy rolled through the region, including the Czech Republic, many thought it was going to be widely boycotted and even booed, says Erik Tabery, editor in chief of the weekly Respekt, founded by dissident journalists in 1989. Instead thousands came out in support of the troops. \u201cCzechs are not pro-American,\u201d Mr. Tabery says. \u201cBut it was a moment of wake-up. People want to show the world we are not on the side of the Kremlin.\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

As he explains it, with a bit of writerly wryness:\n\n\u201cLook, if you go to the dentist and the dentist were to say, \u2018I have this new machine from Russia,\u2019 you\u2019d say, \u2018oh, no,\u2019 \u201d he says, gripping his jaw. \u201cBut if he were to say, \u2018Look, I have this new machine from the US or Germany,\u2019 you\u2019d say, \u2018oh interesting, do it.\u2019 \u201d",
