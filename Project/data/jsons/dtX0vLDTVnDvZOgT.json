He is being held in jail on a $ 5 million cash-only bond .\nAccording to authorities , Rivera \u2013 if that is really his name \u2013 is a 24-year old illegal immigrant from Mexico , whose movements driving a black SUV in the area of Tibbetts \u2019 disappearance were caught on security cameras .

Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass . \u2013 beloved by far-left Democrats and a possible presidential contender in 2020 \u2013 said that she knows this is hard for the Tibbetts family . However , she said that our focus should be \u201c on where the real problems are , \u201d which she said is the separation of \u201c mamas and babies \u201d who entered the U.S. illegally at the border .\nFordham University Professor Christina Greer lamented on MSNBC that \u201c \u2588\u2588\u2588 is talking about a girl in Iowa \u201d instead of devoting more air time to court proceedings Tuesday resulting in felony convictions for former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea to other crimes by President Trump \u2019 s former attorney , Michael Cohen . Greer later backtracked for what she called her \u201c flippant \u201d remark about Tibbetts .\nAmericans should not be distracted by the chirping of these and other advocates of open borders , including the Cato Institute , which claims misleadingly that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans . Even if that statement was factual ( it isn \u2019 t ) , it is completely irrelevant to this case , and no comfort to the victims .\nThe reality is that while most illegal immigrants are not violent , many do commit crimes , sometimes horrific ones , just like Americans do .\nThe nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates in a new report that since 1974 there have been more than 32,000 immigrants incarcerated for homicide in federal and state prisons . Other government reports show that most of these criminal immigrants are in the country illegally . They are not usually legal immigrants , who are vetted for criminal records .\nIt sounds obvious , but nowadays it is necessary to remind lawmakers that these homicides and many other crimes could have been prevented with better border security to block illegal entry into the U.S .\nThe fact that illegal immigration exacerbates crime is not lost on America \u2019 s local law enforcement agencies . Sheriffs and police leaders have become more and more outspoken in recent years urging the federal government \u2013 and especially Congress \u2013 to shore up our immigration enforcement .\nHundreds of sheriffs signed a letter to Congress in the spring , asking for the passage of a House bill to improve enforcement .

The same GAO report found that federal and state governments spent about $ 2.5 billion on incarcerating foreign criminals in 2015 \u2013 not including the additional cost of arrest , prosecution , deportation , and of course , the cost to the victims . Now we see how high the cost can be to Iowans for some of the low-wage workers demanded by local farmers .\nThe killing of Mollie Tibbetts also highlights the role of identity fraud in facilitating the illegal employment that draws most illegal immigrants to this country .\nRivera reportedly used a false identity to secure an Iowa photo ID card and may have used these documents to secure employment at a farm , where he apparently worked for four years . It has not been revealed if he used these same documents to get a driver \u2019 s license .\nAuthorities said the Chevy Malibu that Rivera used to stalk Tibbetts and then transport her body to the corn field where she was later found was not registered in his name . That \u2019 s a common practice for unlicensed drivers , and another in the list of crimes of \u201c otherwise law-abiding \u201d illegal immigrants .\nAn estimated 75 percent of illegal immigrants obtain false documents . Counterfeit green cards are not difficult to detect , but incidents of total identity theft \u2013 in which the illegal immigrant uses the name , date of birth , and Social Security number of a real person \u2013 have become more common .\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on this practice .
