Six percent of voters said they were not sure who they would choose on caucus night .\nEight months before voters head to their caucus sites , though , the poll shows movement within a Democratic primary that is still wide open .\nIn December , months before he even entered the race , nearly a third of Iowa voters said they backed Biden . Today , about six weeks after he announced he would run , Biden 's support has fallen by a third .\nBiden 's declining support came even before this week 's controversy over his flip-flop on the Hyde Amendment , which came after Selzer began fielding her poll .\nIn December , 82 percent of Iowa Democratic voters said they saw Biden favorably ; this month , that number is down to 72 percent of Democratic voters , a 10-point drop . His unfavorable ratings are up 9 points .\nAnd Biden 's backers are less enthusiastic about their chosen candidate than supporters of other candidates . Just 29 percent of Biden 's supporters say they are extremely enthusiastic about backing the former vice president . An average of 43 percent of Sanders , Warren and Buttigieg supporters say they are extremely enthusiastic about backing their chosen candidate .\nThree years ago , Sanders came within a handful of votes of achieving a stunning upset over front-running former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGiuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info : report California political donor indicted for 2 overdose deaths at his home Sanders heart procedures shines spotlight on age of top Democrats MORE .

She has a higher net favorable rating than any other candidate in the field ; 71 percent see her favorably , while just 17 percent see her unfavorably . That 's a better ratio than Biden , Sanders and Buttigieg .\nAn equal number of Democratic voters , 61 percent , say they are actively considering or backing Warren and Biden , the highest rates in the field . That 's 5 points higher than those who say Sanders is on their ticket and 9 points higher than both Buttigieg and Harris .\nWarren has been more aggressive in laying out detailed policy proposals than any other candidate . She has hired more staffers in Iowa than any other candidate , and she has spent more time in Iowa \u2014 more than two weeks \u2014 than any other front-runner .\nIn terms of sheer growth , no one has improved more than Buttigieg , who was n't even included in the December survey . Buttigieg scored just 1 percent support in the March survey , fielded about a week before his first CNN town hall , where he captured the Democratic electorate 's attention and vaulted from also-ran to top contender .\nNo one is in a deeper slump than former Rep.

About 28 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers said they would participate in the virtual caucus , making their votes worth about a third of those who actually show up in person .\nThat has forced Selzer to ask Iowa Democrats not just who they plan to support but how they plan to participate \u2014 and to weight support accordingly .\n`` Those who say they are likely to choose the virtual option are younger , more moderate , and more likely to be currently registered as 'no party , ' which of course they must change to participate in the Democratic Party caucuses .
