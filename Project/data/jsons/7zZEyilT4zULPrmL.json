    "content": "Ten governors in the Northeast and the West Coast announced Monday that they are crafting joint plans for reopening schools and businesses in their states , putting them on a collision course with President Trump , who said he has \u201c the ultimate authority \u201d on when to reopen states after the coronavirus crisis eases .\n\u201c When somebody is president of the United States , the authority is total , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nIn a move led by New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo that blindsided White House officials , the Democratic governors of New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Delaware and Rhode Island banded together to form a Northeast regional task force to immediately begin designing a plan for reopening .\n\u201c You need the best public health plan and the best economic reactivation plan , \u201d Mr. Cuomo said . \u201c It has to be both . To the extent we can do that together , that is the best course . There \u2019 s no doubt about that . \u201d\nHe said they would be \u201c guided by experts and data and science , and not in a political way . \u201d\nLater on Monday , the Northeast coalition said Massachusetts Gov . Charlie Baker , a Republican , was joining the group .\nIn the West , Govs . Gavin Newsom of California , Kate Brown of Oregon , and Jay Inslee of Washington announced their own partnership . They said they have an agreement on a \u201c shared vision \u201d when the time comes to reopen their respective states \u2019 economies .\n\u201c COVID-19 doesn \u2019 t follow state or national boundaries , \u201d the three Democratic governors said . \u201c It will take every level of government , working together , and a full picture of what \u2019 s happening on the ground . \u201d\nMr. Newsom said he plans to offer more details on California \u2019 s reopening plan Tuesday . California has more than 23,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nearly 700 deaths , but the number of hospitalizations has stabilized in recent days .\nThe 10 states have a combined population of about 106 million , nearly one-third of the U.S. total .\nNone of the six governors in the Northeast mentioned a goal of reopening by May 1 , which is the president \u2019 s soft target for getting at least portions of the country back in business .\nThe governors made their announcements hours after the president said he had the authority to decide when states should reopen for business .\n\u201c For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion , some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states , not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government , \u201d Mr. Trump said in a series of tweets . \u201c Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect . It is the decision of the President , and for many good reasons . \u201d\nHe said the administration is \u201c working closely with the Governors , and this will continue . \u201d\n\u201c A decision by me , in conjunction with the Governors and input from others , will be made shortly ! \u201d the president said .\nJonathan Turley , a constitutional law professor at George Washington University , said Mr. Trump is \u201c constitutionally wrong \u201d with his declaration about his authority to reopen states for business .\n\u201c The President has persuasive , not command , authority , \u201d Mr. Turley tweeted . \u201c It remains a state decision under our system of federalism . \u201d\nThe president insisted later during his daily televised coronavirus briefing that he will be calling the shots .\n\u201c I have the ultimate authority , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c We \u2019 re very close to completing a plan to open our country , hopefully even ahead of schedule . We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely reopening their states . \u201d\nMr. Cuomo said he will listen to what the president wants to do but added that Mr. Trump has generally left decisions up to the states during the crisis .\n\u201c I just want clarity , \u201d Mr. Cuomo said . \u201c It is an interesting construct that it wasn \u2019 t the federal responsibility to close the economy , but it is the federal government \u2019 s responsibility to open the economy . If it \u2019 s your authority to open , why [ wasn \u2019 t ] it your authority to close ? \u201d\nDelaware Gov . John Carney thanked Mr. Cuomo for his leadership in New York \u201c and across the country \u201d during the crisis .\nPennsylvania Gov . Tom Wolf also rejected the president \u2019 s claim of authority on decisions when to reopen . \u201c Seeing as how we had the responsibility for closing the state down , we probably have the primary responsibility for opening it up , \u201d he said .\nRhode Island Gov . Gina Raimondo said their move won \u2019 t change the states \u2019 relationship with the administration .\n\u201c Throughout the crisis , the governors are the ones who have been showing great leadership and taking action to keep our residents safe , \u201d she said . \u201c And so I think it \u2019 s only appropriate that we do the same thing now by coming together and showing regional leadership to reopen the economy . \u201d\nConnecticut Gov . Ned Lamont said he doesn \u2019 t want actions to be taken prematurely . \u201c There \u2019 s nothing worse than a false start , \u201d he said . \u201c That would be so demoralizing for our economy . \u201d\nMr. Trump is introducing a task force Tuesday to make recommendations to him about how and when to get the country back to work and school . He has mentioned the option of reopening in phases , starting with regions that haven \u2019 t been hit as hard by the virus as the Northeast .\nThe president \u2019 s task force will include Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin ; Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ; White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow ; U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer ; and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows .\nThe president said last week that the group would be bipartisan and would include outsiders such as governors , business leaders and health care specialists .\nTreasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said that by Wednesday , about 80 million Americans will receive direct payments of up to $ 1,200 this week , plus $ 500 per child , to help with the economic shutdown from the pandemic .\nMr. Trump has had a mixed relationship with governors during the crisis . He has alternated between basking in their praise and bristling when they complain about a slow or confused federal response on delivering medical supplies .\nAt a low point , the president acknowledged that he had urged Vice President Mike Pence , head of the White House coronavirus task force , not to talk to Democratic Govs . Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan , calling her \u201c that woman , \u201d and Mr. Inslee , referring to him as a \u201c snake . \u201d\nDuring the White House briefing , Mr. Trump showed a \u201c sizzle reel \u201d of video clips of various governors , including Mr. Newsom , Mr. Cuomo and New Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy , praising the president for quick action on their requests . It was produced Monday by White House staffers .\n\u201c We could give you hundreds of clips like that , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c They [ governors ] can \u2019 t find anything to complain about . And honestly , many of them didn \u2019 t do their jobs . We help some of the ones that don \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re doing . \u201d\nEach of the Northeast governors will name a health and economic official for their states , plus each governor \u2019 s chiefs of staff , to form a working group to design a reopening plan .\nMr. Murphy , whose state \u2019 s cases of COVID-19 are still rising , spoke of reopening \u201c whenever it is . \u201d\n\u201c We do know this : An economic recovery only occurs on the back of a complete health care recovery , \u201d Mr. Murphy said . \u201c This is the fight of our lives . Reopening ourselves back up will be equally challenging . \u201d\nThe debate over how and when to reopen businesses , restaurants and schools has grown increasingly urgent . Nearly 17 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks , and a $ 350 billion fund for small businesses to retain their workers is expected to run dry this week .\nNo visible progress was made Monday on a $ 250 billion administration request to replenish the fund . Senate Democrats blocked quick action on the proposal last week .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , dug in on the list of demands Democrats want to see in the next round of coronavirus legislation , including money for national rapid testing and protective equipment .\n\u201c We have real problems facing this country , and it \u2019 s time for the Republicans to quit the political posturing by proposing bills they know will not pass either chamber and get serious and work with us towards a solution , \u201d they said in a joint statement .\nThe Paycheck Protection Program was part of the $ 2.2 trillion economic rescue package that recently cleared Congress , but it is in danger of running out of money because of the overwhelming demand .\nRepublican Gov . Larry Hogan of Maryland , chair of the National Governors Association , led another teleconference Monday with Vice President Mike Pence and White House officials in which he asked for $ 500 billion more for states .\n\u201c Without sufficient federal relief , states will have to confront the prospect of significant reductions to essential services , which will in turn devastate the economic recovery and our efforts to get people back to work , \u201d Mr. Hogan said .\nHe said he also spoke to congressional leaders in both parties .\n\u201c This is not a time for politics , \u201d Mr. Hogan said . \u201c We have asked the administration to weigh in so that we can break this logjam in the Senate and get this done for the American people . \u201d",
