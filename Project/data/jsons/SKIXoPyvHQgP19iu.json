    "content": "Story highlights President Obama : Recent storms show how Americans put aside differences , work together\nHe says Americans together fought back from recession , war ; prosperity now on rise\nHe says middle class thrives if everyone gets fair shot , does fair share , plays by same rules\nHe says he will be the champion for aspirations of all Americans , and asks them to vote Tuesday\nFor the past few days , all of us have been properly focused on one of the worst storms of our lifetimes . We mourn those who were lost . And we pledge to stand with those whose lives have been turned upside down for as long as it takes them to recover and rebuild .\nBecause when hardship hits , America is at its best . The petty differences that consume us in normal times quickly melt away . There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm -- only fellow Americans . That 's how we get through the most trying times : together .\nFour years ago , we were mired in two wars and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . Together , we 've battled our way back . The war in Iraq is over , Osama bin Laden is dead , and our heroes are coming home . Our businesses have created nearly 5 and a half million new jobs in the last two and half years . Home values and 401 ( k ) s are rising . We are less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last 20 years . And the American auto industry is back .\nWe 're not there yet . But we 've made real progress . And on Tuesday , America will get to choose between two fundamentally different visions of what makes America strong .\nI believe America 's prosperity was built on the strength of our middle class . We do n't succeed when a few at the top do well while everyone else struggles to get by -- we 're better off when everyone gets a fair shot , everyone does their fair share , and everyone plays by the same rules .\nWhen Bill Clinton was president , he believed that if America invested in the skills and ideas of its people , good jobs and businesses would follow . His economic plan asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more so we could reduce our deficit and still invest in job training and education , research and technology , better health care and a dignified retirement . And what happened ? By the end of his second term , our economy created 23 million new jobs . Incomes rose . Poverty fell . Deficits became the biggest surplus in history .\nThe path Governor Romney offers is the one we tried for eight years after President Clinton left office -- a philosophy that says those at the very top get to play by a very different set of rules than everyone else . Bigger tax cuts for the wealthy that we ca n't afford . Encouraging companies to ship jobs and profits overseas . Fewer rules for big banks and insurance companies . They 're the policies that caused this mess in the first place .\nIn the closing weeks of this campaign , Governor Romney has started calling himself an agent of change . And I 'll give him one thing -- offering another $ 5 trillion tax cut weighted towards the wealthy , $ 2 trillion in defense spending our military did n't ask for , and more power for big banks and insurance companies is change , all right . But it 's not the change we need .\nWe know what real change looks like . And we ca n't give up on it now .\nChange is an America where people of every age have the skills and education that good jobs require . We took on banks that had been overcharging for student loans for decades , and made college more affordable for millions . Now we 'll recruit 100,000 math and science teachers so that high-tech , high-wage jobs do n't end up in China , and train 2 million workers at community colleges for the skills local businesses need right now .\nJUST WATCHED Obama , Romney break down the math Replay More Videos ...
