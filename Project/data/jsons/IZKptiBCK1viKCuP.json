Among the problems it found :\n\u2014 `` The keynote speaker and others claimed the Republican presidential nominee , Mitt Romney , would raise taxes on the 'middle class . ' He has promised he wo n't . Democrats base their claim on a study that does n't necessarily lead to that conclusion .

The fact is the economy has regained only 4 million of the 4.3 million jobs lost since Obama took office . '' -- `` A Democratic governor said Romney 'left his state 47th out of 50 in job growth . ' Actually , Massachusetts went from 50th in job creation during Romney 's first year to 28th in his final year . '' -- `` Multiple speakers repeated a claim that the Ryan/Romney Medicare plan would cost seniors $ 6,400 a year .

Romney had an effective rate of 13.9 percent in 2010 and 15.4 percent in 2011 .
