If that momentum is real and carries him over the finish line , that pushes Trump to 259 electoral votes ; eleven shy of the magic number . That means that in addition to safeguarding all the Romney states , plus tacking on Florida and Ohio ( and Iowa , which is close but leaning red ) , Trump would still need to reel in at least one more 2012 Obama state to win the presidency . If you 're wondering why the Trump campaign is making an eleventh-hour blitz in some blue states , there 's your answer . Colorado alone would n't cut it . Wisconsin alone would n't cut it . Nevada plus New Hampshire would n't cut it . Virginia , Pennsylvania , or Michigan would get the job done , but those states are all still looking very shaky for him .

Trump can not breathe easy almost anywhere , and his margin for error is basically zilch . But if OH/FL/IA/NC keep trending in the 'right ' direction , all eyes will turn to those blue states that could conceivably be in play . If any real movement along those lines is detected , then you really might start to witness Democratic panic .\nBottom line : The data and polling averages still point to a modest but clear Clinton victory . But the cake walk she was dreaming of does n't appear to be materializing at the moment , as her own scandals and failed policies are dragging her down . Trump supporters need to root for decisive momentum in the final days ( which is n't necessarily a pipe dream ) , and for the `` intensity gap '' electoral trend to continue . Plus , one never knows if pollsters are badly blowing a state or two that could result in some surprises next week . Polling is generally pretty darned sophisticated these days , but the professionals do blow it from time to time . Think Iowa and Michigan in the 2016 primaries , the 2014 Kansas Senate race , or the 2015 Kentucky gubernatorial race .
