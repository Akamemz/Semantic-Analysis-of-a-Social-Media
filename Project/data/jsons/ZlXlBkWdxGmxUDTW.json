The year was 1972 and the justices were asked to decide something extraordinary in that era : whether an openly gay couple from Minnesota had a `` fundamental right '' under the Constitution to legally wed .\nIn just 13 words , the court under Chief Justice Warren Burger dismissed the Baker v. Nelson petition , `` for want of a substantial federal question . ''\nFor about four decades that was the final word on the issue , at least legally . Now a generational shift in public acceptance has given same-sex marriage a powerful new voice . Judges around the country -- in state and federal courts -- have spoken with a near unanimity over the past year that millions of gays and lesbians have been denied an equal protection right to tie the knot , or to have their legal unions recognized by their home states .\nThe public debate is back at the nation 's highest court , with the justices being asked to offer a fresh , definitive , and binding ruling . The court next week will return from its summer recess and meet privately to consider appeals originating from same-sex couples in five states : Utah , Oklahoma , Virginia , Wisconsin and Indiana .\nJUST WATCHED Virginia 's gay marriage ban overturned Replay More Videos ...

''\nMany supporters of `` traditional '' marriage privately say preserving an inflexible one-man/one-woman definition of wedlock nationwide would not be realistic moving forward , and that a divided bloc of states upholding the status quo may be the best possible scenario . But all that hinges on what the Supreme Court does and does not do .\nA federal appeals court in August took just nine days after intensive oral arguments to issue its sweeping conclusion that voter-approved same-sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin were unacceptably discriminatory . And state leaders then took just five days to formally ask the Supreme Court to intervene .\nEven Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently hinted a `` why wait '' attitude may predominate .\n`` I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation , '' she told the Associated Press in July , referring to state bans on interracial marriage , which was not struck down by the high court until 1967 . `` If a case is properly before the court , they will take it . ''\nIn their private conference on Monday -- just the nine justices , no one else attends -- the court will discuss among itself whether to grant a `` petition for a writ of certiorari , '' essentially if any of the marriage cases deserve full scrutiny . It takes just four justices to put such petitions on the docket , but five to ultimately prevail on the merits .\n`` The stakes are incredibly high for Americans and for the legacy of the Roberts court , '' said Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center .
