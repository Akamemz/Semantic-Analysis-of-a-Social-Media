    "content": "It seems that these successes within the department have intensified the ambitions of people who want to put V.A . health care in the hands of the private sector . I believe differences in philosophy deserve robust debate , and solutions should be determined based on the merits of the arguments . The advocates within the administration for privatizing V.A . health services , however , reject this approach . They saw me as an obstacle to privatization who had to be removed . That is because I am convinced that privatization is a political issue aimed at rewarding select people and companies with profits , even if it undermines care for veterans .\nUntil the past few months , veteran issues were dealt with in a largely bipartisan way . ( My 100-0 Senate confirmation was perhaps the best evidence that the V.A . has been the exception to Washington \u2019 s political polarization . ) Unfortunately , the department has become entangled in a brutal power struggle , with some political appointees choosing to promote their agendas instead of what \u2019 s best for veterans . These individuals , who seek to privatize veteran health care as an alternative to government-run V.A . care , unfortunately fail to engage in realistic plans regarding who will care for the more than 9 million veterans who rely on the department for life-sustaining care .\nThe private sector , already struggling to provide adequate access to care in many communities , is ill-prepared to handle the number and complexity of patients that would come from closing or downsizing V.A . hospitals and clinics , particularly when it involves the mental health needs of people scarred by the horrors of war . Working with community providers to adequately ensure that veterans \u2019 needs are met is a good practice . But privatization leading to the dismantling of the department \u2019 s extensive health care system is a terrible idea . The department \u2019 s understanding of service-related health problems , its groundbreaking research and its special ability to work with military veterans can not be easily replicated in the private sector .\nI have fought to stand up for this great department and all that it embodies . In recent months , though , the environment in Washington has turned so toxic , chaotic , disrespectful and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve . I can assure you that I will continue to speak out against those who seek to harm the V.A . by putting their personal agendas in front of the well-being of our veterans .\nAs many of you know , I am a physician , not a politician . I came to government with an understanding that Washington can be ugly , but I assumed that I could avoid all of the ugliness by staying true to my values .
