The question is : what happens next ?\nRepublicans already control the House . And Democrats are going to hold the White House . Over the summer , I asked Senate staffers on both sides of the aisle whether Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would actually change anything in Washington , at least between 2014 and 2016 , or whether it would just mean continued gridlock . Here 's what they told me . ( Staffers were granted anonymity so they could speak freely . )\n1 ) Nominations change . There 's one big thing that changes the moment Republicans win Senate : nominations . `` We would have substantially lessened productivity on nominations , which on the judicial front has actually been one of the unsung success stories of this Congress , '' says a senior Democratic aide . Since Reid 's filibuster reforms , Democrats have been able to confirm executive-branch appointees and non-Supreme Court judges with 51 votes , and so they 've gotten a lot of nominees through . That would end . And if there 's a Supreme Court vacancy Republicans would have the power to block any nominees Obama offers .\nTo Republicans , forcing Obama to rely on the veto rather than Reid is a big deal\n2 ) Lawmaking would n't . Neither side expects legislative productivity to budge much . A Republican takeover would n't end legislative gridlock so much as it would move the chokepoint . `` The focus for dysfunction would shift from the Senate blocking bad Republican ideas to the President 's veto blocking bad ideas , but bad ideas would nonetheless be blocked , '' says the Democratic aide . If Republicans take the Senate , some ideas will still fall to Democratic filibusters , but more will make it to Obama 's desk . He 'll have to actually veto things bills like the Ryan budget rather than simply letting them die through Senate inaction .\n3 ) The White House ca n't hide behind Reid . To Republicans , forcing Obama to rely on the veto rather than Reid is a big deal . There 's a `` political effect of Obama being forced to show what he 's for and what he 's against , '' says one senior Republican Senate aide . `` It will be interesting to see how he responds to a Republican effort to roll back regulations or to repeal the parts of Obamacare that members of both parties oppose . Would he agree to some of these things ? ''\n4 ) The Keystone XL pipeline might pass . There 's one policy that Democrats think might actually pass into law if Reid no longer has the power to control the floor : the Keystone XL pipeline . Enough Democrats support it that if Republicans bring it to the floor in a reasonable way they 'll win the vote \u2014 and it 's not clear Obama will fight with a veto . `` People are fed up on Keystone , '' says an aide to a moderate Democratic senator . `` I do n't know how Keystone is n't just approved if Republicans take over . ''\n5 ) Democrats may not be a minority for long . Democrats do n't want to lose the Senate . But they 're not as worried about it as you might imagine . The reason , mainly , is that they think they 'll win it right back . The 2014 map heavily favors Republicans : 21 Democratic seats are up , but only 15 Republican ones . But the 2016 map is even more favorable to the Democrats : as of now , they 'll be defending 10 seats to the GOP 's 24 , and doing it amid the more favorable demographics of a presidential election .\n`` I think there 's a depth people did n't know we could sink to . ''\n6 ) Republicans will be facing a lot of primary challenges . Some Republican incumbents wo n't run for reelection , but most will \u2014 and that means much of McConnell 's caucus will be worrying about a primary challenge . And if there 's one thing Senate Republicans learned from Bob Bennett , Dick Lugar , and Mike Castle , it 's that you do n't want a reputation for working with Democrats if you 're facing a primary anytime soon . `` It 's a very low bar to be more productive than this Senate , '' says one Democratic staffer . `` But it will be stunning how much lower we can go . I think there 's a depth people did n't know we could sink to . ''\n7 ) Will McConnell run a more open Senate ? Senate Republican 's biggest complaint with Reid 's management of the Senate is he does n't run an open amendment process . Democrats think this basically ridiculous : the Senate , they say , has never routinely run truly open amendment processes , as they 're too unwieldy . But Democrats wonder whether McConnell will try it if he takes over . Republican staffers believe he will \u2014 and that it could change the Senate much for the better . `` Re-establishing the committee process and re-opening the floor to amendments on both sides would , I think , go a long way toward alleviating some of the tensions that have built up over here , '' says the senior Republican aide . `` There 's a pent-up desire on both sides to legislate . ''\n8 ) Democrats doubt it . Democratic staffers are more skeptical . `` The interesting thing would be whether the Senate Republicans follow through on their professed desire for open amendments ( which we would use at least as well as they have to highlight contrasts ) or revert to their usual form in past episodes of claiming the majority and act in a vigorously pro-majoritarian way , likely using budget reconciliation to force confrontation over gutting Obamacare , '' says the senior Democratic aide . `` My money 's on the latter . ''\nthere is the dream now that the Senate will become the Senate again\n9 ) Could the Senate finally revolt ? Something both sides bring up often is that rank-and-file senators hate the way the modern Senate works . They believe they were sent to Washington to solve the nation 's problems . They 're embarrassed by how little gets done . They know that their names are n't going to be etched into the history books \u2014 at least not positively \u2014 unless something changes . And so there is the dream now , as there was in 2012 , that after the election , the dam will somehow break , and the Senate will become the Senate again . I 'm skeptical of this hope : senators may loathe the condition of the modern Senate , but they 're the ones responsible , and they 've charted this course as a rational response to their political incentives and policy commitments .

A man goes into his doctor and says `` Doctor , everything has gone wrong ! I 'm sick . I lost my job . My wife has left me . I do n't know what to do ! ''\nHis doctor replies , `` Smile .
