The provisions affect everything from campaign finance laws to financial regulations , marijuana possession and even the government 's purchase of white potatoes .\nThe bill , which was negotiated between Democrats and Republicans over several weeks , is expected to get a vote in the House on Thursday -- right as Washington faces a deadline to avert another government shutdown .\nThe provisions are notable because House Republican leaders frequently tout a transparent process . But some of the items added at the last minute to this massive funding bill were never discussed in any committee hearing , or voted on as part of any of the nearly dozen spending bills that were rolled into one package to result in the 1,603-page legislation .\nHouse Speaker John Boehner defended including all these so-called `` policy riders '' in the spending bill on Wednesday .\n`` Understand all these provisions in the bill were worked out in a bi-partisan , bi-cameral fashion or they would n't be in the bill , '' Boehner said .\nHere is a quick list of some of the changes :\nBlocking new marijuana legalization bill in Washington , D.C. : Voters in D.C. approved a measure to decriminalize recreational marijuana use last month . But Congress has authority over the city 's finances , so the bill bars the District from using any of its own money or federal funds to regulate the use of pot .\nWealthy donors allowed to give more to political parties : The bill increases the individual limits that donors can give to national parties to help fund conventions , building funds and legal proceedings , such as recounts . The change would effectively allow rich donors to give ten times more than they can today to support political parties . Republicans who pushed for the change say they are substituting more private money for the taxpayer money that was collected for national political campaign committees , but instead used to fund a pediatric cancer bill that passed earlier this year .\nMore wheat bread for school lunches : Republicans wanted to block new nutritional requirements for school lunches under a program championed by First Lady Michelle Obama . But instead of wiping out the rule , Republicans and Democrats agreed to give local schools more flexibility on how they decided to include whole grain items on school menus .\nThe sage grouse faces uncertain future : The Fish and Wildlife Service wanted to add the sage grouse - a type of bird found in some western states - to the endangered species list , but Republicans argued that would have a negative economic fallout for energy companies developing resources in those states .\nNo more taxpayer money for expensive portraits : Committee chairs and other high ranking government officials in Washington often commission large , often very pricey portraits of themselves to hang in hearing rooms . Under the bill they would need to use private money to pay for any new portraits .\nOld fashioned light bulbs still allowed : The bill blocks new energy efficient standards that would have made incandescent light bulbs obsolete . Consumers had complained about the new requirements .\nWhite potatoes get top billing : A new provision was added requiring that the Women , Infants and Children program that provides food assistance to low income families include fresh vegetables , and includes an explicit requirement for white potatoes .\nTruckers wo n't be required to get more sleep : Safety advocates wanted to require truck drivers to get a full two night 's sleep before beginning their new shift on the road , but the bill blocks that requirement .\nFarmers get a reprieve from some clean water rules : The deal prevents the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing some of its clean water act rules in some agricultural regions .\nGitmo prisoners ca n't come to the United States : The bill bars money for transferring any detainees held at the facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , to any prisons in the U.S .\nBanks allowed to use taxpayer money to engage in potentially risky trades : The bill rolls back a provision that was part of financial reforms for Wall Street banks . It reverses a rule that was enacted in 2010 that barred banks from using taxpayer backed funds from trading in derivatives . Democrats argue these often risky trades helped contribute to the financial collapse in 2008 .\nBlocks IRS from targeting certain groups : The bill prevents any federal money to be used by the Internal Revenue Service to target any advocacy group based on their ideological leanings . This practice is already not allowed , but Republicans wanted to underline it after internal documents showed that some IRS employees targeted some groups when investigating their tax-exempt status .\nNew sexual harassment training for Hill staffers : The measure requires the Chief Administrative Officer , the office that oversees the thousands of aides working on Capitol Hill , to develop an online training program focused on sexual harassment .
