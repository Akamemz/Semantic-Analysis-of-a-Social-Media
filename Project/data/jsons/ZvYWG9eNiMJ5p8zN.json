It \u2019 s that glorious springtime when every Republican candidate promises to be the next Ronald Reagan . Of course , over time they slowly dissolve into Gerald Ford .\nIt \u2019 s also the time of year when the dons of the Washington establishment tell the rest of us who the conservative grassroots will select next year to lose politely to the Democrats . It \u2019 s always fascinating how many people in D.C. believe they can project how conservatives across America will vote without ever really talking to them . The only Republicans D.C. elites know are the ones they bump into at Talbots or who drive their BMW X-3s to parents \u2019 night at St. Albans\u2014not people who go to church instead of watching \u201c Meet the Press \u201d or who \u2019 d trudge through snow to vote in a caucus in Iowa . Nonetheless , Washingtonians are so certain about next year \u2019 s outcome that they \u2019 re already angling to become pals with the people most likely to be in charge of invitations to events at the Clinton White House .\nConservatives do have one thing to be thankful for : The fact is that Hillary Clinton learned so many lessons from her surprising 2008 defeat that she \u2019 s repeating each of them all over again . Once more she is running as the overconfident , inevitable nominee with safe speeches filled with mush and a bloated campaign staff that already is leaking against each other in the press .\nWhich is probably why so many Republicans , fresh off of their 2014 election triumphs , are excited . They have a chance . It is also why so many prospective GOP candidates\u201418 or 20 by some estimates\u2014are considering a run .
