Voters sometimes surprise the pundits by coming to different conclusions about the outcome of a presidential debate .\nAnd Mr. Obama \u2019 s top strategists predicted that some of Mr. Romney \u2019 s answers \u2014 in particular , his admissions about the need for a voucher system for Medicare \u2014 would deepen the concern in some communities about Mr. Romney \u2019 s policies .\n\u201c He was unable and unwilling to explain the math behind his $ 5 trillion tax cut favoring the wealthy , refused to say what rules he \u2019 d put in place to protect consumers after repealing Wall Street reform , and didn \u2019 t offer a single idea to protect families from insurance company abuses after repealing Obamacare , \u201d Jim Messina , Mr. Obama \u2019 s campaign manager , said in a statement after the debate .\nThe candidates head out to the campaign trail immediately , where Mr. Romney will have to find a way to turn the positive reviews from the debate into a sustained push that changes the dynamic of the race . He is expected to campaign with Representative Paul D. Ryan , his vice-presidential running mate , in Virginia on Thursday evening .\nMr. Obama has been very aggressive of late on the stump , and his scheduled events on Thursday in Denver and Madison , Wis. , will give him a quick opportunity to show that energy . But some Democrats charged with helping to elect Mr. Obama in some key swing states privately expressed frustration after the debate Wednesday night that Mr. Obama \u2019 s lackluster performance made their jobs harder .\nThe debate was designed to be wonkish , and it did not disappoint . By giving the candidates 15 minutes \u2014 or more \u2014 to discuss each topic , the debate provided that there were plenty of long-winding answers filled with sometimes mind-numbing statistics .\nIt might have made the exchange boring in the eyes of voters who have come to expect short and fast-paced political combat .
