After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there, making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.\n\nIt is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as cement production.\n\nThe average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere, as of April 2019, is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution, the concentration was just 280 ppm.\n\nCO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800,000 years between 180 to 280ppm, but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.\n\nNitrogen dioxide\n\nThe gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels, car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.\n\nAlthough there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2, it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.\n\nSulfur dioxide\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning, but can also be released from car exhausts.\n\nSO2 can react with water, oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.\n\nCarbon monoxide\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with hydroxyl radicals, removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n\nParticulates\n\nWhat is particulate matter?\n\nParticulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.\n\nSome are visible, such as dust, whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.\n\nMaterials such as metals, microplastics, soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.\n\nParticulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres.

Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas, particularly along main roads.\n\nHealth impact\n\nWhat sort of health problems can pollution cause?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.\n\nSome of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood, but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.\n\nAs well as this, almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.\n\nParticulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there, causing inflammation and damage. As well as this, some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.\n\nDeaths from pollution\n\nAround seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks, strokes, various cancers and cardiovascular problems.\n\nAsthma triggers\n\nAir pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways, and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.\n\nProblems in pregnancy\n\nWomen exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects, research suggested in January 2018.\n\nLiving within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips, a study by University of Cincinnati found.\n\nFor every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles, birth defects rise by 19 per cent, the research adds.\n\nPrevious research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.\n\nWhat is being done to tackle air pollution?\n\nParis agreement on climate change\n\nThe Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.\n\nIt hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00baF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F)'.\n\nCarbon neutral by 2050\n\nThe UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nThey plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.\n\nSome critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.\n\nInternational carbon credits let nations continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere, balancing out their emissions.\n\nNo new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040\n\nIn 2017, the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.\n\nFrom around 2020, town halls will be allowed to levy extra charges on diesel drivers using the UK's 81 most polluted routes if air quality fails to improve.\n\nHowever, MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030, as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.
