While the campaign is not revealing who will be speaking or when they 'll be addressing the convention , one thing is clear -- it will not be favorable to Romney .\nA knowledgeable source told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that possible speakers could include Steve Pagliuca -- managing partner at Bain Capital , considered the unofficial head of the firm . Pagliuca is a co-owner of the Boston Celtics who ran for the Massachusetts Senate seat formerly held by the late Ted Kennedy and lost in the Democratic primary to Martha Coakley in 2010 .\nAnother possible speaker is Jon Lavine , an Obama campaign bundler and very senior member of the firm . Matt Levin , also a partner at Bain , is said to be very active in Democratic politics as well and could be included in the program .\nThe Bain attack from Obama supporters seemed to subside a bit after the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action produced an ad that linked Romney to the cancer death of the wife of a worker who was let go from a Bain-owned steel mill .\nIn recent weeks , the Romney campaign has taken the Bain attacks head on , pushing back aggressively in ads , opinion columns and speeches . In his nomination acceptance address in Tampa , Romney said about Bain , `` That business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story . '' Romney listed successful Bain companies including Staples , The Sports Authority , an early childhood learning center called Bright Horizons , and Steel Dynamics -- now one of the largest steel producers in the country .\nRomney continued , `` These are American success stories . And yet the centerpiece of the president 's entire re-election campaign is attacking success . In America , we celebrate success , we do n't apologize for it . We were n't always successful at Bain .
