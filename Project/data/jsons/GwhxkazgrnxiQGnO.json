    "content": "Coal-state lawmakers , accusing President Obama of using a back door to impose strict emissions limits on power plants , are rallying to slam that door shut -- claiming the plan would cost jobs and jack up electric bills .\nIn Kentucky , West Virginia , and other states that rely on coal to fuel their own economies -- and that help generate power for everybody else -- officials vowed Monday to introduce legislation halting the newly announced EPA plan .\nUnder the draft regulation unveiled Monday , carbon emissions at fossil fuel-burning power plants would be cut 30 percent by 2030 .\nSen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , calling the move an `` assault '' on the economy and an `` illegal use of executive power , '' said he 'd `` force a vote to repeal it . ''\nOn the House side , Democratic West Virginia Rep. Nick Rahall announced he would introduce legislation , along with Rep. David McKinley , R-W.Va. , to stop the EPA plan .\n`` We will introduce bipartisan legislation that will prevent these disastrous new rules from wreaking havoc on our economy in West Virginia , '' Rahall said in a statement .\nThe 645-page plan , expected to be finalized next year , is a centerpiece of Obama 's climate change agenda , and a step that the administration hopes will get other countries to act when negotiations on a new international treaty resume next year .\n`` We have a moral obligation to act , '' EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said , in announcing the plan Monday morning .\nWhile the proposed regulation drew praise from environmental groups , the coal industry and coal-state lawmakers were apprehensive .\nBill Bissett , president of the Kentucky Coal Association , said he 's `` certain that it will be very bad news for states like Kentucky who mine and use coal to create electricity . ''\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , who represents Kentucky , called it a `` dagger in the heart of the American middle class '' -- and predicted higher power costs and less reliable energy as a result . McConnell 's general election opponent , Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes , also spoke out against the plan .\nThe draft regulation sidesteps Congress , where Obama 's Democratic allies have failed to pass a so-called `` cap-and-trade '' plan to limit such emissions .\nUnder the plan , carbon emissions would be reduced 30 percent by 2030 , compared with 2005 levels . The proposal sets off a complex regulatory process in which the 50 states will each determine how to meet customized targets set by the EPA .\nStates could have until 2017 to submit a plan to cut power plant pollution , and 2018 if they join with other states to tackle the problem , according to the EPA 's proposal .\nEPA data shows that the nation 's power plants have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 13 percent since 2005 . But with coal-fired power plants already beleaguered by cheap natural gas prices and other environmental regulations , experts said reaching the targets wo n't be easy .
