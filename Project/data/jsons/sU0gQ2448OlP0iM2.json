Heidi Heitkamp , North Dakota Democrat , who last month escaped the normally sweltering August in the nation \u2019 s capital by darting off to western Canada .\nThe Canadian government picked up the tab so that Ms. Heitkamp could take what she called an \u201c essential \u201d trip to tour various energy sites in Alberta to talk about issues like oil sands and the TransCanada pipeline ( Correction : An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that the trip had been funded by American taxpayers based on information provided by Sen. Heitkamp \u2019 s office . )\nShe was among dozens of lawmakers who used the traditional summer recess in Congress to travel the far reaches of the globe on someone else \u2019 s dime .\nSome charged their trips to the government as official business related to their committee assignments . Others , like Rep. Frank D. Lucas , Oklahoma Republican , and Rep. John B. Larson , Connecticut Democrat , let special interests pay their way in the name of fact-finding .\nMr. Lucas , Mr. Larson and other lawmakers traveled to Ireland as guests of the Ripon Society and the Franklin Center for Global Policy Exchange , two think tanks .\nThe lawmakers reported that they met with Irish officials to discuss policy , but also took in some of the best of the Emerald Isle \u2019 s tourism sites \u2014 the Guinness Storehouse , Leinster House , the Irish Parliament , Dublin Castle , Powerscourt Gardens , Newman House and Christ Church Cathedral .\nSuch trips catch the eye of ethics watchers such as Kent Cooper , who for a quarter-century ran the Federal Election Commission \u2019 s disclosure office .\n\u201c This type of free trip not only covers the members \u2019 expenses but provides a rare opportunity for the sponsor to cover the costs of a spouse or family member , \u201d Mr. Cooper wrote recently in his Political MoneyLine blog highlighting the Ireland trip . \u201c For members who are not home that much , the free trip is a great payback to the spouse . The spouse or family member has plenty of time for sightseeing and enjoying the foreign city . \u201d\nThe disclosure forms show the private organizations shelled out $ 15,310 for Mr. Larson and his son and $ 8,875 for Mr. Lucas and his wife . At least two dozen lawmakers also were invited to the event , though not all have filed their disclosure reports .\nNo matter who is paying the tab , there \u2019 s little evidence that lawmakers have tamed their travel itineraries in the face of the sequester budget cuts that took effect in March , or facing the very real possibility that the government is headed toward a shutdown at month \u2019 s end over the failure to reach a budget deal .\nIn fact , privately funded trips appear to be on track to grow this year over their 2011 high-water mark . LegiStorm , a database that compiles data on Congress , estimates that lawmakers went on $ 5.9 million worth of privately funded trips in 2011 , and so far in 2013 have taken trips valued at $ 5.2 million \u2014 with most of the August trips still to be reported .\nTaxpayer-funded trips are tracking their historical norms , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of the first nine months of travel records .\nIn 2011 , the House of Representatives spent $ 3.1 million on official travel overseas . In the first nine months of 2012 , House members spent $ 3.7 million . So far in 2013 , members have spent $ 2.6 million , though that number is expected to rise as more travel reports are filed from the summer recess .\nOne of the unknowns is how much lawmakers are costing the Pentagon when they hop aboard free military flights as part of their trips . Currently , their disclosure reports don \u2019 t reflect the actual costs of those flights .\nIn March , Rep. Walter B. Jones , North Carolina Republican , introduced legislation that would require public disclosure of costs each time a member of Congress hitches a ride on a military plane .\n\u201c Unless it \u2019 s absolutely necessary to get into a war zone or to visit the troops , I don \u2019 t think the military should be used as an overseas travel service , \u201d Mr. Jones said .\nThe Defense Department is not required to disclose the exact costs to taxpayers when it transports lawmakers overseas , an issue that \u2019 s drawn fire from fiscal watchdogs .\n\u201c The military maintains a specially outfitted VIP fleet of aircraft , stationed at Joint Base Andrews , costing up to $ 10,000 per hour to operate , \u201d Thomas Schatz , the president of Citizens Against Government Waste , wrote in a letter sent to Capitol Hill in support of Mr. Jones \u2019 bill . \u201c Members of Congress often take advantage of these military aircraft for overseas travel , even in instances where commercial flights are readily available and more cost-effective . \u201d\nThe disclosure requirement was eventually passed by the House as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2014 that gives the Pentagon its funding .\n\u201c It is my belief that members of Congress should save money whenever possible by using commercial airlines , \u201d Mr. Jones said . \u201c Even if my colleagues disagree with me and continue to travel by military aircraft , I think it is perfectly reasonable for them to let the taxpayers know how much money this practice costs . \u201d\nNot all the trips that lawmakers take , of course , have glamour or glitz .\nThe top Republican on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee , Sen.
