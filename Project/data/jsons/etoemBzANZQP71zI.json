( June 29 ) AP\nHe left a years-long trail of harassment , threats and contemptuous behavior . There were dozens of warning signs that he might turn violent \u2013 including repeated threats of killing a journalist .\nAlthough none of that was seemingly taken very seriously by authorities , Jarrod Ramos \u2019 words and online activity offer examples that in hindsight could have prompted a stronger response from his employers , police and the court system . Ramos is now charged with killing five people at a Maryland newspaper last week .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed thousands of pages of court records and interviewed dozens of people who knew or interacted with Ramos to build this profile . It shows an angry man who became obsessed with the people he felt wronged him , from a former high school classmate and her lawyer to the judges he appeared before and the journalists who exposed his campaign of harassment .\nExperts say the attack at the Capital Gazette highlights the challenges of trying to balance the rights of people to speak freely against concerns that they could turn violent . In a court filing , Ramos said he had seen five mental health professionals for at least 75 visits before last week 's shooting .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t lock someone up because you have an inner fear about what he might do , '' said Richard Barajas , executive director of the National Organization for Victim Assistance and former chief judge of the Texas Court of Appeals . \u201c The criminal justice system is not designed for it . And the mental health system is ill-equipped to do it . \u201d\nDespite his pattern of threats , Ramos never offered any hint he would actually act on them . He had been engaged in a lengthy fight with the Capital Gazette over its coverage of a court case in 2011 which he pleaded guilty to harassing a former classmate . In one court filing , Ramos said he wanted to kill journalist Eric Hartley but phrased it in a very specific way : `` If not illegal , ( I ) would kill the living body of Hartley . ''\nStill , his behavior was enough to strike fear in attorney Brennan McCarthy , who represented the high school classmate Ramos pleaded guilty to harassing .\nMcCarthy chillingly warned in a court filing : `` There exists a very real possibility that at some point in time , Mr. Ramos will take these violent fetishes as expressed in print , and will try to carry them out in person . ''\nRELATED : Capital Gazette shooting suspect remembered as 'loner ' obsessed with reputation\nRELATED : Accused Capital Gazette shooter had sued newspaper , held grudge\nRamos ' extensive court filings provide a window into his hyperbolic contemptuous attitude toward the legal system . After a judge sentenced him to counseling and probation for stalking his former classmate online , Ramos tried to have the woman prosecuted for perjury , suggested the judge should be disbarred and then unsuccessfully sued the journalist and newspaper . He criticized one court clerk for being sloppy because her mother was ill and suggested another made mistakes because she was thirsty .\nRamos titled sections of his court filings `` Murder of the spirit '' and `` blood on their hands , '' and he acknowledged he told his former classmate to `` have another drink and go hang yourself , you cowardly little lush. \u201d He emailed her boss to say she was a \u201c bipolar drunkard leading a double life. \u201d He then insisted he was `` not a wantonly abusive person '' and had n't hurt anyone since he was a child . Ramos lost out on a job opportunity with a former boss who found out about the court case and said he \u2019 d hire him only when it was resolved .\nThe initial Capital Gazette article about Ramos in 2011 highlighted the dangers posed by online relationships , which then were still a relatively new phenomenon . Experts say that today , Ramos ' actions might have been taken more seriously .\n`` It \u2019 s possible that the courts may have taken a different approach had they realized the level of threat , '' said Victor Fornari , a psychiatrist at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks , New York . `` On the other hand , are we accustomed to putting people in custody for what they say ? Usually not . We \u2019 re innocent until proven guilty . There \u2019 s a real tension between free will , free speech and public safety . \u201d\nOn Monday , it was revealed that Ramos sent letters the day of the shooting \u2013 to the newspaper 's former attorney , a courthouse in Baltimore , the Maryland Court of Special Appeals and a law office \u2013 announcing his intentions to kill `` every person present . ''\nRelated : Suspect sent threatening letters on day of rampage , police say\nOn Twitter , Ramos regularly attacked the Capital Gazette , its journalists , editors and the judge who presided over the case . He centered many of his threats on the former reporter who wrote about his harassment conviction , Eric Thomas Hartley , and the retired publisher , Tom Marquardt .\nRamos almost regularly posted comments on how he wanted members of the staff to kill themselves and his hopes that the newspaper would shut down . He repeatedly included the hashtag # CapDeathWatch .\nIn a post in September 2014 , Ramos mentioned a shotgun , saying \u201c My bullets are words. \u201d Police say Ramos used a shotgun in the shooting .\nIn one haunting tweet in February 2015 , Ramos \u2019 account said , \u201c I 'll enjoy seeing @ capgaznews cease publication , but it would be nicer to see Hartley and Marquardt cease breathing . \u201d\nRamos ' Twitter account featured Hartley 's picture as its avatar and included the tagline `` making corpses of corrupt careers . '' On Hartley 's forehead was an image inserted from the Japanese manga and anime series `` Berserk , '' which recounts the ritual murder of people marked with it . Ramos also placed the symbol on Marquardt 's head .\nMarquardt contacted local police and considered getting a restraining order . Police investigated but could not conclude Ramos would act on his threats . Since last week 's shooting , police have not commented on his past behavior or their interactions with him , citing the murder case against Ramos .\nHe said he accepted the outcome and decided it would be best for everyone at the Capital Gazette to maintain a low profile . Still , a photograph of Ramos was circulated to all employees so they would be aware of him .\nRamos ' loathing of the press also extended beyond the Capital .\nIn 2014 , he posted his thoughts on the beheadings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff and accused the press of propaganda . \u201c Journalists making a living ( literally ) by participating in propaganda is nothing new , \u201d he wrote . \u201c Think about it . \u201d\nRamos also posted multiple times about the 2015 attack at the French magazine Charlie Hebdo , even including altered images of one magazine staff member with a bullet hole in his head and blood on his face .\nIn a court filing in 2014 , attorney McCarthy alerted the court to Ramos ' Twitter postings and noted the threats had escalated over time . McCarthy also warned the court to never let Ramos be alone with a female worker .\n`` Of the thousands of people I \u2019 ve dealt with in court , this guy stuck , '' he said . `` I was extremely scared that he was going to do something to me and my family . ''\nMcCarthy called Ramos a `` classic loner '' and `` as angry and obsessive an individual as you will ever meet . ''\nHe also said Ramos viewed anyone who opposed him as an enemy : `` He described adverse parties as belligerents ... Like he 's at war .

The FBI said Brandon Griesemer , a 19-year-old grocery worker , called the CNN switchboard in Atlanta and said , \u201c Fake news , I \u2019 m coming to gun you all down , \u201d according to his federal criminal complaint , and \u201c I have a gun and I am coming to Georgia right now . \u201d\nGriesemer was charged with a federal crime that carries a fine and up to five years in prison . The complaint says Griesemer phoned in threats to the news agency 22 times over two days .
