Obama\u2019s personal metric\u2014the Obama jobs deficit\u2014stands at a lofty 7.7 million workers.\n\nThe Obama Jobs Deficit\n\nPresident Obama promised during the 2008 campaign (and after) that under his policies, the economy would create millions of new jobs by the end of 2010. He also insisted that he be held accountable for these results, a request that may soon come to pass. By December 2010, the Obama jobs deficit\u2014the difference between the Obama jobs target and actual payroll employment\u2014stood at 8.3 million jobs.

But as employment fell at the end of 2008, he increased the employment target by 1 million to 3.5 million jobs.[1] At the time, employment stood at about 135.1 million, according to the Department of Labor\u2019s most commonly used measure. This establishes the current Obama jobs target at 138.6 million.\n\nThe most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report for October shows the economy continuing its lackluster performance. The economy managed only 171,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate, which had dipped mysteriously in September, jumped back up to 7.9 percent.\n\nAs noted, the original Obama jobs target was for December 2010. Yet the economy was not expected to freeze in place at that point but continue to grow.

In short, allowing for normal growth in the labor force means the Obama jobs deficit two years later has declined by less than a half-million workers.\n\nRecovery Despite Obama\u2019s \u201cBest\u201d Efforts\n\nThe centerpiece of Obama\u2019s short-term stimulus program was $862 billion in poorly targeted tax cuts and ineffectual spending increases that he signed into law in February 2009, since supplemented by a number of smaller budget-busting \u201cjobs\u201d bills. Obama had one big shot at really helping the economy, and he took it, holding nothing back.\n\nHad it worked, had employment recovered as promised, the President would have a strong case to make defending his otherwise indefensible fiscal policies.

No wonder it always fails.\n\nObama Tax Hike Weakening Job Creation\n\nThe federal government cannot stimulate the economy in the short term by increasing its borrowing and reshuffling total demand through wasteful (or even wise) deficit spending. But government can stimulate the economy by improving incentives and the general economic environment. The massive tax hike President Obama has proposed to unleash on the economy by allowing the most vital parts of the 2001/2003 tax relief to expire at the end of this year goes in the diametrically opposite direction and is already draining the vitality from the economy and job creation.\n\nSeemingly bent on perpetuating joblessness, Obama and his allies are seeking to raise some of the most damaging taxes possible. They seek to raise tax rates on the investors who are needed to provide seed corn for new businesses and on small businesses that use this seed corn to spur innovation and job growth. Foolish in the best of times, raising these economically punishing taxes in the face of high unemployment is indefensible.\n\nEconomic Malpractice\n\nFor private-sector job creation to accelerate to bring down the unemployment rate and the Obama jobs deficit, step one is for Washington\u2019s job-destruction machine to take a permanent vacation. The intentions of Obama and his congressional allies to raise tax rates on small businesses, on savers and investors, on the risk takers who propel the economy with their successes goes well beyond ideology to economic policy malpractice.\n\n\u2014J.
