    "content": "During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s , Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $ 400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines , registration desks , bars and other cabinets at Harrah 's at Trump Plaza .\nThe family cabinetry business , founded in the 1940s by Edward \u2019 s father , finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization , the resort \u2019 s builder .\nEdward \u2019 s son , Paul , who was the firm \u2019 s accountant , still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later : $ 83,600 . The reason : the money never came . \u201c That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company\u2026 which has been around since my grandfather , \u201d he said .\nDonald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will `` protect your job . '' But a \u2588\u2588\u2588 NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades \u2014 and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans , like the Friels , who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them .\nAt least 60 lawsuits , along with hundreds of liens , judgments , and other government filings reviewed by the \u2588\u2588\u2588 NETWORK , document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work . Among them : a dishwasher in Florida . A glass company in New Jersey . A carpet company . A plumber . Painters . Forty-eight waiters . Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs , coast to coast . Real estate brokers who sold his properties . And , ironically , several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others .\nTrump \u2019 s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage , according to U.S. Department of Labor data . That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York . Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages .\nIn addition to the lawsuits , the review found more than 200 mechanic \u2019 s liens \u2014 filed by contractors and employees against Trump , his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work \u2014 since the 1980s . The liens range from a $ 75,000 claim by a Plainview , N.Y. , air conditioning and heating company to a $ 1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm . On just one project , Trump \u2019 s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City , records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren \u2019 t paid in full or on time , including workers who installed walls , chandeliers and plumbing .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s say that they do a job that \u2019 s not good , or a job that they didn \u2019 t finish , or a job that was way late . I \u2019 ll deduct from their contract , absolutely . That \u2019 s what the country should be doing. \u201d Donald Trump\nThe actions in total paint a portrait of Trump \u2019 s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals , then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years . In some cases , the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents , draining their resources . Some just give up the fight , or settle for less ; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether .\nTrump and his daughter Ivanka , in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment . If a company or worker he hires isn \u2019 t paid fully , the Trumps said , it \u2019 s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s say that they do a job that \u2019 s not good , or a job that they didn \u2019 t finish , or a job that was way late . I \u2019 ll deduct from their contract , absolutely , \u201d Trump said . \u201c That \u2019 s what the country should be doing . \u201d\nTo be sure , Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments , or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties .\nHowever , the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump \u2019 s judgment as a businessman , and as a potential commander- in- chief . The number of companies and others alleging he hasn \u2019 t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors , or that Trump businesses renege on contracts , refuse to pay , or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases .\nIn the interview , Trump repeatedly said the cases were \u201c a long time ago. \u201d However , even as he campaigns for the presidency , new cases are continuing . Just last month , Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event . The settlements averaged about $ 800 for each worker and as high as $ 3,000 for one , according to court records . Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami , the lawsuit contends . Trump \u2019 s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers , and he wasn \u2019 t responsible , and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment .\n\u201c Trump could have settled it right off the bat , but they wanted to fight it out , that \u2019 s their M.O. \u201d said Rod Hannah , of Plantation , Fla. , the lawyer who represented the workers , who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public . \u201c They \u2019 re known for their aggressiveness , and if you have the money , why not ? \u201d\nSimilar cases have cropped up with Trump \u2019 s facilities in California and New York , where hourly workers , bartenders and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks to not passing along tips to servers . Trump 's company settled the California case , and the New York case is pending .\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s trial attorneys visibly winced , began breathing heavily , and attempted to make eye contact with the witness. \u201d Ruling by Miami Dade Circuit Judge Jorge Cueto\nTrump 's Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent non-payment claims by two different paint firms , with one case settled and the other pending . Last month , his company \u2019 s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $ 30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn \u2019 t paid .\nJuan Carlos Enriquez , owner of The Paint Spot , in South Florida , has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral . The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump \u2019 s course , then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene .\nIn courtroom testimony , the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump \u201c already paid enough. \u201d As the construction manager spoke , \u201c Trump \u2019 s trial attorneys visibly winced , began breathing heavily , and attempted to make eye contact \u201d with the witness , the judge noted in his ruling .\nThat , and other evidence , convinced the judge The Paint Spot \u2019 s claim was credible . He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on , sold , and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed . Trump \u2019 s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale , and the contest continues .\nTrump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America , including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City . \u201c No matter who you are , we 're going to protect your job , \u201d Trump said Tuesday . \u201c Because let me tell you , our jobs are being stripped from our country like we 're babies . \u201d\nBut the lawsuits show Trump \u2019 s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives \u2014 but devastating to his much-smaller foes .\nIn 2007 , for instance , dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump \u2019 s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach , Fla. , alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees .\nAerial view of Mar-a-Lago , the oceanfront estate of Donald Trump in Palm Beach , Fla. , on Jan. 22 , 2005 .\nMar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $ 7,500 to settle the case in 2008 . The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case , according to court records .\nDevelopers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry , said Colette Nelson , chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association . But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees .\n\u201c Real estate is a tough and aggressive business , but most business people don \u2019 t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with , \u201d she said , stressing she couldn \u2019 t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump \u2019 s record . \u201c But there are a few . \u201d\nIn the interview , Trump said that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees , insisting all are paid fairly . \u201c We pay everybody what they \u2019 re supposed to be paid , and we pay everybody on time , \u201d he said . \u201c And we employ thousands and thousands of people . OK ? \u201d\nDespite the Trumps \u2019 assertion that his their companies only refuse payment to contractors \u201c when somebody does a bad job , \u201d he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again . It \u2019 s a puzzling turn of events , since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor , and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court , aren \u2019 t likely to offer to rehire them .\nDonald Trump , right , waits with his brother Robert for the start of a Casino Control Commission meeting in Atlantic City on March 29 , 1990 . Trump was seeking final approval for the Taj Mahal Casino Resort , one of the world 's largest casino complexes .\nNevertheless , such was the case for the Friels . After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984 , Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father , Edward , come to the Trump family \u2019 s offices at the casino for a meeting . There Edward , and some other contractors , were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother , Robert Trump .\n\u201c He sat in a room with nine guys , \u201d Paul Friel said . \u201c We found out some of them were carpet guys . Some of them were glass guys . Plumbers . You name it . \u201d\nIn the meeting , Donald Trump told his father that the company \u2019 s work was inferior , Friel said , even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it . The bottom line , Trump told Edward Friel , was the company would n't get the final payment . Then , Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre . Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future .\n\u201c Wait a minute , \u201d Paul Friel said , recalling his family 's reaction to his dad \u2019 s account of the meeting . \u201c Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future ? \u201d\n\u201c We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway . And we have , for the most part , exceptional contractors on them who get paid , and get paid quickly . But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work . And he doesn \u2019 t do that. \u201d Ivanka Trump , Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization\nAsked about the meeting this week , Trump said , \u201c Was the work bad ? Was it bad work ? \u201d And , then , after being told that the general contractor had approved it , Trump added , \u201c Well , see here \u2019 s the thing . You \u2019 re talking about , what , 30 years ago ? \u201d\nIvanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month .\n\u201c We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway . And we have , for the most part , exceptional contractors on them who get paid , and get paid quickly , \u201d she said , adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work . \u201c But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work . And he doesn \u2019 t do that . \u201d\nBut , the Friels \u2019 story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City . Legal records , New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar .\nDonald Trump stands next to a genie lamp as the lights of his Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort light up the evening sky marking the grand opening of the venture in Atlantic City on April 5 , 1990 .\nA half-decade after the Friels \u2019 encounter , in 1990 , as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino , he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed . In casino commission records of an audit , it was revealed that Trump \u2019 s companies owed a total of $ 69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project . Some already had sued Trump , the state audit said ; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could . The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls , chandeliers , plumbing , lighting and even the casino \u2019 s trademark minarets .\nOne of the builders was Marty Rosenberg , vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co. , who said he was owed about $ 1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal . When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full , Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role , representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump .\nRosenberg \u2019 s mission : with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors , Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses , most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support .\n\u201c Yes , there were a lot of other companies , '' he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid . `` Yes , some did not survive . ''\nRosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones . He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project . The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work , and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full .\nThe analysis of Trump lawsuits also found that professionals , such as real estate agents and lawyers , say he 's refused to pay them sizable sums of money . Those cases show that even some loyal employees , those selling his properties and fighting for him in court , are only with him until they \u2019 re not .\nReal estate broker Rana Williams , who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company , sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $ 735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012 . Williams , who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump , said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate \u201c based on nothing more than whimsy . \u201d\nTrump and Williams settled their case in 2015 , and the terms of the deal are confidential , as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies .\nHowever , Williams ' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed . In her sworn testimony , Williams said the 2013 commission shortage was n't the only one , and neither was she the only person who did n't get fully paid . \u201c There were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn \u2019 t come , \u201d she testified . \u201c That was both for myself and for some of the agents . \u201d\nAnother broker , Jennifer McGovern , filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007 , citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid . A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $ 298,274 .\nEven Trump \u2019 s own attorneys , on several occasions , sued him over claims of unpaid bills .\nOne law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump \u2014 New York City \u2019 s Morrison Cohen LLP \u2014 ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008 . Trump didn \u2019 t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club .\nAs Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers , however , Morrison Cohen counter-sued . In court records , the law firm alleged Trump didn \u2019 t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees . Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court , confidentially , in 2009 .\nIn 2012 , Virginia-based law firm Cook , Heyward , Lee , Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $ 94,511 for legal fees and costs . The case was eventually settled out of court . But as the case unfolded , court records detail how Trump 's senior deputies attacked the attorneys ' quality of work in the local and trade press , leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds .\nTrump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $ 10 billion as a result of his business acumen . Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren \u2019 t paid by him haven \u2019 t been as fortunate .\nEdward Friel , left , and his wife , owned a family cabinetry business that says it was badly harmed by non-payment on a big contract at one of Donald Trump 's Atlantic City casinos .\nEdward Friel , of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work , hired a lawyer to sue for the money , said his son , Paul Friel . But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they \u2019 d recover .\nThe unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids . \u201c The worst part wasn \u2019 t dealing with the Trumps , \u201d Paul Friel said . After standing up to Trump , Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City . \u201c There \u2019 s tons of these stories out there , \u201d he said .\nThe Edward J. Friel Co. filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 5 , 1989 .\nContributing : John Kelly , Nick Penzenstadler , Karen Yi , David McKay Wilson",
    "content_original": "Introduction Burned in his memory\n\nShare This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email\n\nDuring the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.\n\n\n\nThe family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward\u2019s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort\u2019s builder.\n\n\n\nEdward\u2019s son, Paul, who was the firm\u2019s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. \u201cThat began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company\u2026 which has been around since my grandfather,\u201d he said.\n\nDonald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades \u2014 and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n\nAt least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.\n\nTrump\u2019s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic\u2019s liens \u2014 filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work \u2014 since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump\u2019s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren\u2019t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say that they do a job that\u2019s not good, or a job that they didn\u2019t finish, or a job that was way late. I\u2019ll deduct from their contract, absolutely. That\u2019s what the country should be doing.\u201d Donald Trump\n\nThe actions in total paint a portrait of Trump\u2019s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.\n\nTrump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview with USA TODAY, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment. If a company or worker he hires isn\u2019t paid fully, the Trumps said, it\u2019s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say that they do a job that\u2019s not good, or a job that they didn\u2019t finish, or a job that was way late. I\u2019ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the country should be doing.\u201d\n\nChapter 1 'Visibly winced'\n\nTo be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties.\n\nHowever, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump\u2019s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander- in- chief. The number of companies and others alleging he hasn\u2019t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses renege on contracts, refuse to pay, or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases.\n\nIn the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were \u201ca long time ago.\u201d However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases are continuing. Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump\u2019s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers, and he wasn\u2019t responsible, and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment.\n\n\u201cTrump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that\u2019s their M.O.\u201d said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public. \u201cThey\u2019re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?\u201d\n\nSimilar cases have cropped up with Trump\u2019s facilities in California and New York, where hourly workers, bartenders and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks to not passing along tips to servers. Trump's company settled the California case, and the New York case is pending.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact with the witness.\u201d Ruling by Miami Dade Circuit Judge Jorge Cueto\n\nTrump's Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent non-payment claims by two different paint firms, with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company\u2019s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn\u2019t paid.\n\nJuan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump\u2019s course, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene.\n\nIn courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump \u201calready paid enough.\u201d As the construction manager spoke, \u201cTrump\u2019s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact\u201d with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling.\n\nThat, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot\u2019s claim was credible. He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump\u2019s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues.\n\nEnriquez still hasn\u2019t been paid.\n\nChapter 2 Unpaid hourly workers\n\nTrump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City. \u201cNo matter who you are, we're going to protect your job,\u201d Trump said Tuesday. \u201cBecause let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies.\u201d\n\nBut the lawsuits show Trump\u2019s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives \u2014 but devastating to his much-smaller foes.\n\nIn 2007, for instance, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees.\n\nAerial view of Mar-a-Lago, the oceanfront estate of Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Fla., on Jan. 22, 2005.\n\n(Photo: New York Daily News via Getty Images)\n\nMar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case, according to court records.\n\nDevelopers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees.\n\n\u201cReal estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most business people don\u2019t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,\u201d she said, stressing she couldn\u2019t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump\u2019s record. \u201cBut there are a few.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Trump said that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly. \u201cWe pay everybody what they\u2019re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?\u201d\n\nChapter 3 The slot-machine cabinets\n\nDespite the Trumps\u2019 assertion that his their companies only refuse payment to contractors \u201cwhen somebody does a bad job,\u201d he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It\u2019s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court, aren\u2019t likely to offer to rehire them.\n\nDonald Trump, right, waits with his brother Robert for the start of a Casino Control Commission meeting in Atlantic City on March 29, 1990. Trump was seeking final approval for the Taj Mahal Casino Resort, one of the world's largest casino complexes.\n\n(Photo: AP)\n\nNevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family\u2019s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward, and some other contractors, were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump.\n\n\u201cHe sat in a room with nine guys,\u201d Paul Friel said. \u201cWe found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.\u201d\n\nIn the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company\u2019s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn't get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future.\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Paul Friel said, recalling his family's reaction to his dad\u2019s account of the meeting. \u201cWhy would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly. But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d Ivanka Trump, Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization\n\nAsked about the meeting this week, Trump said, \u201cWas the work bad? Was it bad work?\u201d And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, \u201cWell, see here\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re talking about, what, 30 years ago?\u201d\n\nIvanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month.\n\n\u201cWe have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,\u201d she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. \u201cBut it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nBut, the Friels\u2019 story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City. Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar.\n\nDonald Trump stands next to a genie lamp as the lights of his Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort light up the evening sky marking the grand opening of the venture in Atlantic City on April 5, 1990.\n\n(Photo: Mike Derer, AP)\n\nA half-decade after the Friels\u2019 encounter, in 1990, as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino, he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed. In casino commission records of an audit, it was revealed that Trump\u2019s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some already had sued Trump, the state audit said; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could. The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino\u2019s trademark minarets.\n\nOne of the builders was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full, Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role, representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump.\n\nRosenberg\u2019s mission: with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors, Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses, most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support.\n\n\u201cYes, there were a lot of other companies,\" he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid. \"Yes, some did not survive.\"\n\nRosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project. The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full.\n\nChapter 4 Unpaid based on whimsy\n\nThe analysis of Trump lawsuits also found that professionals, such as real estate agents and lawyers, say he's refused to pay them sizable sums of money. Those cases show that even some loyal employees, those selling his properties and fighting for him in court, are only with him until they\u2019re not.\n\nReal estate broker Rana Williams, who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company, sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012. Williams, who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump, said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate \u201cbased on nothing more than whimsy.\u201d\n\nTrump and Williams settled their case in 2015, and the terms of the deal are confidential, as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies.\n\nHowever, Williams' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed. In her sworn testimony, Williams said the 2013 commission shortage wasn't the only one, and neither was she the only person who didn't get fully paid. \u201cThere were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn\u2019t come,\u201d she testified. \u201cThat was both for myself and for some of the agents.\u201d\n\nAnother broker, Jennifer McGovern, filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007, citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid. A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $298,274.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills.\n\nOne law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump \u2014 New York City\u2019s Morrison Cohen LLP \u2014 ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn\u2019t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club.\n\nAs Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen counter-sued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn\u2019t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Virginia-based law firm Cook, Heyward, Lee, Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $94,511 for legal fees and costs. The case was eventually settled out of court. But as the case unfolded, court records detail how Trump's senior deputies attacked the attorneys' quality of work in the local and trade press, leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds.\n\nTrump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen. Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren\u2019t paid by him haven\u2019t been as fortunate.\n\nChapter 5 'Tons of these stories out there'\n\nEdward Friel, left, and his wife, owned a family cabinetry business that says it was badly harmed by non-payment on a big contract at one of Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos.\n\n(Photo: Photo courtesy of Friel family)\n\nEdward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel. But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they\u2019d recover.\n\nThe unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids. \u201cThe worst part wasn\u2019t dealing with the Trumps,\u201d Paul Friel said. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of these stories out there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Edward J. Friel Co. filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 5, 1989.\n\nSays the founder's grandson: \u201cTrump hits everybody.\u201d\n\nContributing: John Kelly, Nick Penzenstadler, Karen Yi, David McKay Wilson",
