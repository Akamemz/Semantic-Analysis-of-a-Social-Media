    "content": "Even in the days before 9/11 , David Bellavia imagined what it would be like to be an American soldier .\n\u201c Saving Private Ryan \u201d had made an impression on him , and he envisioned , as with the veteran at the film \u2019 s end , \u201c being wheeled across some wonderfully manicured cemetery , respected by foreigners \u201d as he surveyed the fruits of liberation his fighting had wrought .\nMr. Bellavia had already seen the streets of Fallujah , Iraq , overrun by the Islamic State in January 2014 . A decade earlier , he had earned one of the nation \u2019 s highest medals for valor , the Silver Star , while deployed there .\nLast week , the fall of Ramadi brought it back to mind . The battles for Fallujah and Ramadi were fierce ; more American troops died in that part of the country than in any other . Iraq \u2019 s second-largest city , Mosul , has also fallen .\nOver the past 15 months , each conquest of the Islamic State has given the soldiers and Marines who served in Iraq more to grapple with : What is the appropriate measure of success to justify the sacrifices made ? Must Iraq be a democracy ? Must it be peaceful ? Or is it enough that the United States homeland is comparatively safe ?\nFor those who have returned , Iraq often has maintained a grip on the imagination and the heart . One soldier , a small-town boy entranced by the construction of a mosque from which insurgents once shot at him , turned to Google Maps to watch its progress , and to remember the routes he once wound through the streets of Mosul \u2013 \u201c reminiscing , if you will . \u201d\nAnother , the son of a Vietnam veteran , now shares a \u201c certain dark humor \u201d with his father about watching an achievement purchased at such cost unravel . Saigon then , Ramadi now .\nYet for each , there is something that remains beyond memory and the news images flashing across television screens . There is pride , and there is a deep compassion for what the people of Iraq are suffering . Above all , they say , there is a fellowship forged in conditions of sacrifice \u2013 the closest thing to \u201c victory \u201d that the veterans of Iraq can claim , and beyond the reach , many add , of any Islamic State bullet or bomb .\nStill the news from Iraq this past year often has been tough to process .\nRetired Col. V.J . Tedesco was a battalion commander in Ramadi in 2006 . In recent months , he has fielded late night phone calls , along with e-mails and Facebook shares , about the \u201c discomfort , anguish , and aggravation \u201d about the spread of the Islamic State .\n\u201c Obviously for anybody who \u2019 s walked those streets and worked with those people and shed blood to liberate those places from Al Qaeda in Iraq , this is a discomforting , very disturbing time , seeing Ramadi fall to ISIS , \u201d he says , using a common acronym for the Islamic State .\nMr. Tedesco watched his father , a Vietnam vet , go through a similar journey back in the early 1970s as Saigon fell .\nFor Bellavia , the fall of Ramadi has made him think that perhaps he has more in common with Vietnam veterans than he had imagined . While the false pretenses of the Iraq War made it controversial almost from Day 1 , he says , it didn \u2019 t feel like Vietnam to him . \u201c We were appreciated ; they were disrespected . We were embraced . They weren \u2019 t . \u201d\nBut while Americans at home were supportive , they were detached . Now , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey , who himself commanded the Iraqi security force training mission early in the war , has said Ramadi isn \u2019 t all that strategically important in the first place . \u201c The city itself , it \u2019 s not symbolic in any way , \u201d he said at a Pentagon briefing last month , seemingly preparing the nation for the possibility that the city would soon be in Islamic State hands . \u201c I would much rather that Ramadi not fall , but it won \u2019 t be the end of a campaign \u201d if it does .\nWith the fall of the city , the prospects of Bellavia 's \u201c Saving Private Ryan \u201d moment receded further .\n\u201c There are no living recipients of the Medal of Honor from Iraq , no celebrated stories from Iraq , really , \u201d he says . \u201c I hate to make this about me , but we thought we were changing the world . We really thought that every one of these terrorists we were going after was going to make the world safer . \u201d\n\u2018 I feel bad not for losing what we did there , but more for the people \u2019\nSome of those terrorists shot at Master Sgt . Jeremy Ware from the minarets of a Mosul mosque that was being constructed 10 years ago . Even then , though , Sergeant Ware \u2019 s overwhelming impression of the mosque was one of awe .\n\u201c I just always call it \u2018 the great mosque. \u2019 It is enormous , \u201d he says .\nHe recalls one day when he and some fellow soldiers were offered a tour of the grounds .\n\u201c I \u2019 m from a small town in New York , so things like that \u2013 being next to a big structure like that \u2013 it was pretty neat . I enjoyed it . \u201d\nIt was a crash-course cultural exchange in one city block . Ware also was amazed by the construction process , which involved little more than some old hand tools and a portable cement mixer .\nThrough the months that Mosul was falling to the Islamic State , Ware stayed connected with the city with the help of Google Maps . \u201c I like to look at the progress of the mosque , the routes we used to take , the different structures , what \u2019 s changed , what hasn \u2019 t changed . I remember stories \u2013 reminiscing , if you will . \u201d\nIt consistently struck him how hard the Iraqis had worked to \u201c get their lives back on track , and to live their lives in a normal way \u2013 those are big things \u201d in the midst of war , he says . \u201c The hard work that went into it \u2013 not by us , but by them \u201d is what he thinks about when heard of the fall of Mosul .\n\u201c To be honest , I feel bad not for losing what we did there , but more for the people . \u201d\nKeeping perspective is one way to try and manage the frustration , the soldiers say .\nPrior to moving his battalion into Ramadi , Tedesco \u2019 s soldiers worked in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq with the Yazidis . A number of his battalion \u2019 s interpreters were Yazidi . \u201c We developed an affection and affinity for the Yazidis . It was easy to empathize with them because they \u2019 d been persecuted for so long as a religious minority , \u201d he says . \u201c They were invested in trying to create a new Iraq . \u201d\nLast year , the Islamic State moved into the Sinjar region , threatening genocide against the Yazidis . Tedesco \u2019 s answer was to become involved with the Yazidi community in the US . \u201c I tried to keep things in perspective \u2013 I focus on others and not myself , \u201d he adds .\nIt can be easy for troops to come down hard on themselves , says Jeremiah Workman , a Marine who was awarded the second highest commendation for valor , the Navy Cross , for repeatedly entering a house filled with insurgents to recover the bodies of his comrades in arms .\n\u201c You can really beat yourself up \u2013 say that Iraq was a failure , that people died in vain . It can be depressing as hell , \u201d he says .\nSo he tries to look at it another way . \u201c We were assigned to clear the city of Fallujah of insurgents while we were there \u2013 and we did a very good job at it , \u201d he says . \u201c We gave the Iraqis what they needed to move forward . What they do with it is on them , and that \u2019 s the approach you have to take . \u201d\nHe takes little consolation in his Navy Cross . \u201c To me , I look at that , and I was awarded it for something terrible. \u201d At the same time , however , \u201c I \u2019 m very proud of my service , and I don \u2019 t think what \u2019 s happening now tarnishes that or cheapens it . \u201d\n\u201c We accomplished our mission and we did it in a way no one had seen before , \u201d he adds . \u201c The way we worked together to defeat that enemy \u2013 how could you not be proud ? \u201d\nAs a boy , Mr. Workman had watched all the Vietnam movies . His father and grandfather had both served in the Army , and he and his younger brother put on their old uniforms to play outside .\nFrom the day he shipped off to boot camp , Workman says , \u201c I thought to myself , \u2018 I hope I can be half the sort of man you read about , doing heroic things and saving their buddies \u2019 lives . I just want to be half \u2013 or a quarter \u2013 the man that those guys were if I \u2019 m put in that situation . \u2019 \u201d\nAt night in Fallujah , Workman would lay in bed , \u201c thinking of my brother , and playing war in our yard. \u201d As captain of his high school football team , he \u2019 d become accustomed to being looked to for direction . In war , \u201c People look at you wondering , \u2018 Am I going to get to go home ? Am I going to get to see my family again ? \u2019 \u201d\nCombat , for him , was ultimately about his fellow soldiers , and he takes solace in this . \u201c It \u2019 s not really about Mom and Dad and baseball games and apple pie . It \u2019 s literally about the men to the left and the right of you . You have to keep that in focus . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a point that Tedesco , too , is reminded of each year , when he sends a letter to the parents of the 19 soldiers serving with his battalion who were lost .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an obligation I take seriously \u2013 I made it when I buried them , to let their parents know that their child is not forgotten , \u201d he says .\nFallujah , Mosul , and Ramadi \u2013 all have fallen , but his letters still go out every year .\n\u201c They died bravely , and regardless of what happens in the future these parents can take pride in the fact that their child stepped forward and fought bravely on a dangerous and difficult battlefield , \u201d Tedesco says . \u201c They answered the call . \u201d\n\u201c In war , you don \u2019 t know what you \u2019 re going to get out of a human being . It \u2019 s human nature not to go into a house , knowing you \u2019 re going to die . But then you see people that just go above and beyond again and again , people you literally have to drag kicking and screaming off the battlefield because they want to stay and fight for their buddies , \u201d Workman says .\nHis family had been an Army family , but he recalls seeing a Marine recruiter walk into his high school cafeteria during lunch in his small town of Richford , Ohio , a small farm town , population roughly 2,000 , in north central Ohio . \u201c Everyone \u2019 s heads turned and watched this guy . The way he walks , the way he talks \u2013 the way he carried himself was just different . \u201d\nThose were the people Workman wanted to serve with \u2013 and he did . And that \u2019 s what he holds close when he thinks of his time serving in the Iraq War . \u201c I can \u2019 t believe that I had the opportunity to serve with other human beings who love their country this much . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThe recent feelings of frustration , though painful at times , have ultimately brought him and his fellow soldiers closer together , says Bellavia .\nWhen it \u2019 s a tough night \u201c and you need to talk , you can , \u201d he says . \u201c We have to take it upon ourselves to sit down and talk , and to tell each other , \u2018 Hey , pick up the phone anytime , and here \u2019 s my number. \u2019 It \u2019 s still no man left behind . \u201d",
