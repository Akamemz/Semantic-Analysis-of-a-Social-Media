    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump is four days away from assuming the presidency after one of the most tumultuous transitions in modern history , setting the stage for a rocky period of dramatic change , partisan acrimony and unpredictable results .\nTrump will take office with far lower poll ratings than his recent predecessors , with majorities of Americans doubtful of his capacity to handle the job . He 's at war with the nation 's intelligence agencies , has a dysfunctional relationship with the press , is fighting claims that he 's too cozy with Russia and is brushing off conventional ethical standards for an incoming president . China has warned him about changing policy related to Taiwan and Mexico has threatened retaliation if Trump imposes a border tax .\nFor any other incoming president , such a pile of controversies and crises would suggest an early political disaster is imminent for the new White House . But Trump broke the mold in his outsider campaign and has repeatedly shrugged off scandals and controversies that would have downed normal politicians . He appears determined to shake up conventions that have built up around the presidency for two centuries and has little time for those who say he lacks presidential demeanor .\nIn fact , many of the political storms raging as he takes office have been instigated by Trump himself . Inciting chaos and disruption has been the key to his political career , helping him rupture the Republican establishment and win the White House . He seemingly has no plans to change tactics in the White House .\n`` He is reinventing the modern presidency , '' said Timothy Naftali , a CNN presidential historian .\nBut as Trump takes office , his signature style , designed to keep everyone off balance , is facing its most significant test .
