    "content": "Bill Lawrence of Texas recently posted on his Facebook page that he sold his business because of Obamacare .\nNaturally , Mr. Lawrence was then invited on Fox News to be interviewed about his ordeal . He was on the Megyn Kelly show a week ago Friday .\nMost of Kelly \u2019 s questions were fat softballs or in some cases just statements ( \u201c Employers like you might just have to say , ' I \u2019 m gettin \u2019 rid of my company ! ' '' ; \u201c Your thoughts on having your livelihood directly affected based on what politicians in Washington felt was best for you ? \u201d ) .\nI looked up Bill and decided to give him a buzz to learn more . He lives outside of Houston . We spoke for 45 minutes . He \u2019 s a guy who \u2019 s sort of hard not to like -- funny , very sharp and obviously a very good businessman who built a large business from scratch .\nBill recently sold his company Bubbles Car Wash , with 13 locations and 290 employees , to a private equity fund for what he admitted was a tremendous price . \u201c I \u2019 ve been very successful , \u201d he acknowledged . ( He boasted in a 2011 Houston Business Journal article that he owns two Mercedes and a Bentley convertible . )\nWith 290 employees , his business would be subject to the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s employer mandate that kicks in in 2015 ( assuming it isn \u2019 t delayed , as it has been once already ) , which will force companies to offer insurance to workers or else pay a penalty . Bill says it would have run him in the neighborhood of $ 400,000 annually .\nMy first question to him was : Would he show me some of his business \u2019 s financial records ? Maybe an annual report , preferably something audited , so I could analyze his claim about the catastrophic effect Obamacare would have had on his business ? He would not .\nDid Megyn Kelly request such verification ? No , he said , she did not .\nI then pressed Bill on whether there were any other reasons he was selling his business . He admitted to me that there were plenty of others ( \u201c myriad reasons , \u201d in his words ) . What were some of them ? \u201c You ever run a business ? \u201d he asked with a chuckle . And then he began ticking off a bunch of problems in his life that he said he \u2019 d now be glad to be rid of . The headache of managing workers . Taxes , fees and permits of every shape and size and color ( dumpster permits , gate permits , this permit , that permit ) . He complained to me that he has to pay $ 300 for an \u201c auto dealer \u2019 s \u201d permit just to sell air fresheners at the checkout counter of his car wash centers .\nFrom the sound of it , Gov . Rick Perry is more to blame for Bill \u2019 s choice to retire than Obama . Perhaps Texas is not the pro-business eden that Perry portrays it to be .\nNonetheless , Bill insisted that the Affordable Care Act was the \u201c primary \u201d reason he chose to sell out and retire after 22 years . He told me he spent a year attending seminars and seeking advice from lawyers and insurance experts on the employer mandate , and it was universally made clear to him that the new federal law would make it too costly to stay in business .\nThere \u2019 s no questions that Bubbles Car Wash will have to absorb a new cost under the employer mandate . The question is how great it will be , and whether it will impact the business enough to have required Bill to unload it . Although Bill wouldn \u2019 t show me any hard financial data , I asked him if he could give me a brief sketch of his company \u2019 s revenue . He thought for a while , and then said he \u2019 d estimate that the company had around $ 13 million a year in revenues and about $ 900,000 in earnings -- earnings , meaning post-salary ( he wouldn \u2019 t tell me what his annual salary had been as an owner of the business ) .\nBill also told me most of his wage earners do not want health insurance . He \u2019 s offered a mini-med program in the past , a very cheap and bare-bones plan that employees could purchase , and they usually decline it . If that \u2019 s the case , Bill \u2019 s burden will be much smaller than what he told Megyn Kelly . Under the Affordable Care Act , Bill must simply offer his employees a chance to share in the cost of an insurance plan . The worker \u2019 s share can legally be as high as 9.5 percent of the worker \u2019 s household income . Once Bill has made this offer to an employee , if the employee declines the coverage then Bill is off the hook and doesn \u2019 t have to pay a penalty .\nAnd sadly , Bill might be correct that his wage earners ( who earn $ 8.50 to $ 10 an hour ) can \u2019 t afford to spend as high as 9.5 percent of their salaries sharing the cost of an insurance plan .\nI sent Bill an article from a recent Forbes magazine that shows how businesses of his size , and specifically Texas businesses , will have ample opportunity to keep Obamacare costs very low by strategically offering insurance plans that they know their employees will reject , forcing them onto the individual exchange in some cases . He did not respond .\nIncidentally , Bill also told me that the private equity company that bought him out had approached him as early as \u201c three or four years ago , \u201d so he was at least speaking to the buyers before Obamacare ever existed . A spokesperson for the new owner refused to talk to me for this article . Suffice it to say , however , that a private equity firm sees enormous potential in Bubbles Car Wash with or without Obamacare .\nIn the final analysis , Bill is a strong conservative who believes government has no business saddling him with new costs . He said it would be nice if every citizen could be insured , but \u201c even if the cost were only 10 percent of what I \u2019 ve estimated , \u201d he said to me , \u201c why should the federal government make it my responsibility to pay for it ? \u201d ( We decided to agree that there is no right or wrong answer to that question , only opinions . )\nAnd as for Megyn Kelly , she asked very few probative questions before or during the interview , preferring instead to just take Bill \u2019 s claim about Obamacare at face value . But clearly there was another side of the story .\nSpecial thanks to Bill Bertovich , one of my readers , who tipped me off to the above segment .",
