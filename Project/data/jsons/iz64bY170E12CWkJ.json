    "content": "The trial of the Fort Hood gunman , who is acting as his own attorney , took a surreal turn as the former Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 in the November 2009 attack grilled witnesses -- including his former boss in the military and a fellow Muslim who spoke to him the day of the shooting .\nAfter a short opening statement in which ex-Army Maj. Nidal Hasan called himself a `` mujahedeen , '' admitted to the rampage and said `` the dead bodies will show that war is an ugly thing , '' Hasan cross-examined prosecution witnesses , including retired Lt. Col Ben Kirk Phillips , his former boss . When pressed by the defendant , Phillips acknowledged that his officer evaluation report had graded Hasan as `` outstanding . ''\nBut he declined to cross-examine one of his shooting victims , Sgt . Alonzo Lunsford , who provided the day \u2019 s most damning testimony .\nLunsford \u2013 who was shot seven times during the incident \u2013 described what happened that day , saying he first saw Hasan sitting in a chair , with his arms on his knees while looking at the floor .\nHe said Hasan then jumped up and ordered the one civilian in the room to leave before shouting , \u201c Allahu akbar \u201d and opening fire . Panic set in among the soldiers , who crowded toward a rear door , which was jammed .\nLunsford said he sprinted for the door at one point while Hasan was shooting , then turned around to see the gunman \u2019 s laser sight pointing at him before being shot in the head . Lunsford testified he tried to appear dead , then later decided to flee because , `` dead men do n't sweat . ''\nHe then made another sprint for the door as he was shot six more times before being pulled to safety .\nEarlier , Hasan cross-examined Pat Sonti , who met Hasan at the Killeen Islamic Center in Fort Hood the morning of the shooting . Sonti said Hasan took the microphone at the mosque and called for prayer .\n\u201c After call to prayer , he bid goodbye and told the congregation he was going home , '' Sonti said . `` I found that odd . \u201d\nHasan asked Sonti to describe the difference between the call for prayer and actual prayer , then asked who is supposed to lead the call .\n`` Whoever the imam looks at , '' replied Sonti . `` But you know that , sir . ''\nIt was not clear how the 42-year-old Hasan plans to fashion his stance into a defense . Hasan had wanted to argue that he shot U.S. troops to protect Taliban fighters in Afghanistan , but the judge forbade the American-born Muslim and former Army psychiatrist from using that defense . Three witnesses took the stand after opening arguments , including the manager of the store Guns Galore , where Hasan had purchased the FN 27 model 5.7 handgun used in the attack .\n`` Almost every trip I can remember was always [ for ] ammunition and magazines , extensions and at one point an additional laser , \u201d David Cheadle testified .\nAnother store employee , Frederick Brannan , who sold the weapon to Hasan , said he saw the shooter in the store almost every week where he would buy up to 300 rounds of ammo each time .\n`` The sheer quantity of ammo being shot was expensive , '' Brannan said on the stand adding that he purchased magazine extensions and and a green laser sight that cost $ 350 .\nHenricks told the military jury Hasan picked the date of the attack for a specific reason , though he did not immediately reveal details .\nThe trial is expected to take weeks and possibly months . Taking the witness stand will be many of the more than 30 people who were wounded , plus dozens of others who were inside the post 's Soldier Readiness Processing Center , where some service members were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan .\nHasan has never denied carrying out the attack , and the facts of the case are mostly settled . But questions abound about how the trial will play out . How will Hasan question his victims ? How will victims respond ? How will his health hold up ?\nThe defendant , who was shot in the back by officers responding to the attack , is now paralyzed from the waist down and must use a wheelchair . He requires 15- to 20-minute stretching breaks about every four hours , and he has to lift himself off his wheelchair for about a minute every half hour to avoid developing sores .\nThe judge , Col. Tara Osborn , told jurors to prepare for a trial that could last several months .\nOn Tuesday , guards stood watch with long assault rifles outside the courthouse . A long row of shipping freight containers , stacked three high , created a fence around the building , which was almost entirely hidden by 15-foot-tall stacks of heavy , shock-absorbing barriers that extend to the roofline .\nThe government has said that Hasan , a U.S.-born Muslim , had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki , a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011 .\nAuthorities in the military justice system have also struggled to avoid reversed sentences on appeal . Eleven of the 16 death sentences handed down by military juries in the last 30 years have been overturned , according to an academic study and court records .\nThat 's one reason why prosecutors and the military judge have been careful leading up to trial , said Geoffrey Corn , a professor at the South Texas College of Law and a former military lawyer . `` The public looks and says , ` This is an obviously guilty defendant .
