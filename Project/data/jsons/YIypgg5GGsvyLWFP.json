Rashida Tlaib ( D-MI ) . Omar said she wanted to talk about the political influence in this country that says `` it is ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country . '' Omar was speaking in particular about Israel , making it the second incident of derogatory speech toward the Jewish state and its supporters this month .\nIn an attempt to defend her comments , she said a lot of people think because she is Muslim , every comment she makes about Israel is anti-Semitic . NBC News reports she went on to state the criticism prevents a `` broader debate '' about Israel 's treatment of Palestinians .\n`` I want to ask , 'Why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the National Rifle Association , or fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma , and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policy ? ' '' said Omar .\nRep. Eliot Engel ( D-NY ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in which Omar serves , condemned her comments in which she suggested Israel demands allegiance from American lawmakers .\n`` I welcome debate in Congress based on the merits of policy , but it 's unacceptable and deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views , including support for the US-Israel relationship , '' said Engel according to the Washington Examiner . `` We all take the same oath . Worse , Rep. Omar 's comments leveled that charge by invoking a vile anti-Semitic slur . ''\n`` Her comments were outrageous and deeply hurtful , and I ask that she retract them , apologize , and commit to making her case on policy issues without resorting to attacks that have no place in the Foreign Affairs Committee or the House of Representatives , '' Engel continued . `` This episode is especially disappointing following so closely on another instance of Ms. Omar seeming to invoke an anti-Semitic stereotype '' .\nRep. Nita Lowey ( D-NY ) , chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee , went to Twitter to condemn Omar 's comments .\n`` Lawmakers must be able to debate without prejudice or bigotry , '' Lowey tweeted . `` I am saddened that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel . I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful . ''\nBut Omar fought back against her fellow congresswoman , defending her comments in series of tweets .\n`` Our democracy is built on debate , Congresswoman !
