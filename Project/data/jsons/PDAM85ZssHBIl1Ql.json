ET .\nThe GOP establishment , confronted by a recalcitrant electorate that refuses to leave Donald Trump , is being forced to take a fresh look at Ted Cruz , a man with grassroots strength in key early primary states and few friends in Washington .\nSuddenly , the Republican Party 's best hope could be a man hell-bent on transforming it : a senator who openly spars with fellow GOP colleagues , and has campaigned by painting its leaders as spineless and feeble .\nHeaded into Tuesday 's CNN Republican presidential debate , Cruz and Trump have turned Iowa into a two-man race , with the Texan leading in two new polls . Cruz is up 31 % to Trump 's 21 % among likely GOP caucus-goers , according to the Bloomberg Politics-Des Moines Register poll released Saturday . A Fox News poll Sunday has Cruz leading Trump 28 % to 26 % .\nA small and growing number of Republicans allied with the establishment -- the force long thought to quickly consolidate against a surging Cruz bid -- are coming to terms with the idea that he may be palatable in an election cycle where Trump has pushed the envelope well beyond what they considered acceptable .\n`` Oh God , yes , '' said Ed Rogers , a top Republican lobbyist , when asked if he 'd prefer Cruz . `` Compared to Trump , he 's OK . ''\nEstablishment Republicans had enough of a problem when Trump began his populist-fueled move to the top of national polls , where he has stubbornly remained for five months . But Cruz 's steady rise means that even if Trump were taken out by a well-financed negative campaign , they might have to deal with a stronger Cruz , who has more political polish than the more improvisational Trump .\n`` If you talk to my peers around town , collectively it 's an appreciation the guy is smart as hell , '' explained a senior Washington Republican who is backing another candidate . `` He can be a more acceptable alternative to Trump , if it comes to that . ''\nThe irony has n't escaped them . Said the Republican : `` It 's an interesting life -- and everything 's relative . ''\nMost establishment Republicans have been drawn to the half-dozen candidates who come from that wing of the party , especially Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who has lived in the mid-teens in most polls , and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , who has dropped down to 3 % nationally . But given Cruz 's surging poll numbers and Trump 's remarkable political durability , some wonder if it could be Cruz that emerges as the compromise candidate .\n`` The second he starts to look like a winner in Washington , '' Rogers said , `` he 's going to have a bunch of new friends . ''\nIt 's a dilemma swatted away on Capitol Hill -- perhaps optimistically .\nAsked about choosing Trump or Cruz , 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain would only allow that they are `` smart people . '' Bush backer Sen. Susan Collins would just offer that they are `` obviously not my choice . ''\nAnd there 's no guarantee either one can beat Hillary Clinton .\n`` He 's not as outrageous as Trump , but I do n't know that he 's any more electable than Trump , '' said Charlie Black , a senior adviser to Republican presidential campaigns for over two decades .\nBrian Walsh , a longtime Senate campaign aide , said it 's an out-of-control Trump -- not an in-control Cruz -- that explains the Texan 's growing appeal .\n`` Trump has gone so far that it has in some ways masked how problematic Cruz would be as the nominee as well , '' he said .\nDespite his background as an Ivy League-educated attorney and his time in the Bush administration , Cruz rose to prominence as a tea party darling who became the national face of the 2013 government shutdown . Cruz has spent the two years since working to salvage his relationship with some potential investors in his campaign , but he has reveled in his image as a Washington bad boy , the only senator willing to do on Capitol Hill what he campaigned on back at home .\nIt 's something that has made him enemies in Washington , where he has not convinced a single Senate colleague to back his campaign . Cruz helped push Republicans to shut down the government in a high-stakes fight over Obamacare , a strategy that failed to get results but did n't cause a predicted electoral meltdown .\nOn the trail , he has shown no willingness to moderate his positions , bragging about his conservative purity and his rabble-rousing reputation in the Capitol .\nBut even compared to Cruz 's burn-it-down rhetoric , Trump 's campaign has been more incendiary and worrisome for party elders determined to beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . The mogul had harsh things to say about Hispanics , prisoners of war , women in the media , the disabled , and most recently , Muslims , who he thinks temporarily should not be allowed to enter the United States .\nAnd most concerning for GOP leaders , Trump has frequently floated leaving the Republican Party altogether to mount an independent bid , which would significantly increase Clinton 's chances of winning the White House .\nThe pair appears to be heading toward a clash that Cruz , at least , long sought to delay . On Friday evening , about 24 hours after audio leaked of Cruz questioning Trump 's judgment at a private fundraiser , the real estate mogul launched his first attacks on Cruz .\nCruz had attempted to head that off by alleging that mainstream Republicans were trying to sow discord .\n`` The Establishment 's only hope : Trump & me in a cage match , '' he tweeted Friday morning . `` Sorry to disappoint \u2014 @ realdonaldtrump is terrific . # DealWithIt ''\nCruz has done little to woo the Republicans he used as his bogeyman : He has raised the lion 's share of his money far from the New York-to-Washington corridor , raced to the party 's right flank on every issue of the day , and campaigned loudly on the polarizing social issues that one well-placed Republican said puts some contributors permanently out of reach .\nCruz , on paper , should not be as repellent to the GOP political class as he is .
