    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nReps. Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas have brought forward a formal article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nIt goes without saying these two congressmen are Democrats.\n\nIt does not go without laughing, however. Years and years and years ago, there was this show about animal research and the scientist had placed a soccer ball or something in the middle of a ring of monkeys. Every few seconds, a monkey would reach a hesitant hand toward the ball, only to be slapped away by the researcher. This went on \u2014 and on and on and on. Monkey reach, monkey slapped, monkey retreat \u2014 monkey reach again. The point was to show just how limited in brain development the monkeys really were, because their instincts to touch overcame their instincts to listen to their pain. It really did become comical after a while.\n\nThat\u2019s how the Democrats are on impeachment. They just can\u2019t help themselves.\n\nAfter months and months and months of listening to the left call for Trump\u2019s ouster from office \u2014 a call that laughingly began before Trump even took over the White House \u2014 the mantra has become monkeyish.\n\nNow come Sherman and Green with the paperwork.\n\nSorry, fellas. Even CNN\u2019s against you on this one.\n\n\u201cFor starters,\u201d wrote CNN\u2019s digital director of politics, Z. Byron Wolf, there\u2019s no indication that Trump is anywhere near to being impeached.\u201d\n\nWell, yeah. There is that. Typically \u2014 and this is just an opinion, from someone who\u2019s not an attorney \u2014 there must be a crime committed before the charges are affixed.\n\nThe order of operation goes like this: Crime. Charge. Conviction \u2014 or acquittal. Sadly, the order for Democrats on Trump has been this \u2014 Charge. Move to convict. Now go find the crime.\n\nAnd thanks to a very, very complicit and biased media, Democrats have been able to move forward with frightening speed on this order. But now they\u2019ve lost a key asset \u2014 CNN. You know it\u2019s bad for your leftist side when CNN reports in favor of a Republican.\n\nThe article of impeachment accuses Trump of interfering with the FBI\u2019s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and alleges the president \u201csought to use his authority to hinder and cause the termination of such investigations.\u201d\n\nWell, once again, good luck with that fellas. The House, controlled by Republicans, isn\u2019t likely to pass the article. Democratic leaders, looking ahead to 2018 elections and realizing the crazy Rep. Maxine Waters has brought with her Tourette Syndrome-like call for impeachment, have distanced themselves from such talk \u2014 at least in earshot of the media. And the American people, even those who wouldn\u2019t consider themselves in the Trump camp, aren\u2019t at all ready for a Bill Clinton Redeux \u2014 that is, impeachment.\n\nGreen is simply partisan.\n\nBack in May, he made it clear from the House floor: \u201cThis is where I stand. I will not be moved. The president must be impeached.\u201d\n\nHe said it \u2014 that was his plan all along. Impeach Trump, facts, evidence and truth be danged. On one hand, it\u2019s refreshing to see a politician actually honor a promise. On the other, going down in political history as one of the monkeys who couldn\u2019t stop touching the soccer ball, despite the constant slap-down and sting, is not really all that commendable after all. Here\u2019s a bit of advice for Democrats pursuing impeachment: Wait for the crime.
