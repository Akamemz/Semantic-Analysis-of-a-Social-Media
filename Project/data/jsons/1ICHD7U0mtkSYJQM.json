Occasionally two that they have led on . But there \u2019 s no other candidate in the field who on every one of those issues has stood up and led and has fought for conservative principles as a consistent conservative . \u201d\nHe also said every candidate is going to promise to take care of veterans , but the difference is that he \u2019 s going to honor that promise .\n\u201c And you know that because I \u2019 ve honored the promises I \u2019 ve made in public life year after year after year , \u201d he said .\nHe said it \u2019 s worth noting foreign policy is something that can change \u201c almost immediately with a new president , \u201d pointing to the 1981 release of hostages by Iran the day President Reagan was sworn in .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the difference a commander in chief with credibility can have , \u201d he said . \u201c And I will point out \u2014 if you look at elections where national security and foreign policy is front and center , that has historically tended to benefit senators over governors because most governors do not have significant experience or involvement in these issues and in the Senate , you \u2019 re dealing with [ them ] every day .\n\u201c And I will say this , come January 20 , 2017 \u2014 I think of all of the candidates on that stage , the Ayatollah Khamenei , when I stand up and tell the Ayatollah you will either shut down your nuclear program or we will shut it down for you , I think I \u2019 m the one commander in chief who the Ayatollah will believe , because I \u2019 ll carry through and do exactly what I said I would do , \u201d he said .",
