''\nBut Walker 's shifting attempts to strike the right balance on lightning rod issues from immigration to same-sex marriage to abortion highlight the conundrum he faces in trying to build a winning coalition in socially conservative Iowa and remain viable in the states beyond , donors and GOP strategists said .\nCharlie Sykes , a Wisconsin conservative radio host who has known Walker well for two decades , said Walker 's strident tone on the gay marriage ruling last month caught people back home off guard because historically he had been `` almost agnostic '' on the subject .\n`` I was surprised , because I thought there was probably an easier way to finesse that , '' said Sykes .\nWhen a federal court struck down a same-sex marriage ban in Wisconsin last year , Walker said the fight was over in Wisconsin and deemed it an issue for officials at the federal level .

In an ad for his 2014 reelection race , Walker touted his pro-life position , but went on to say he supported legislation that `` leaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor . ''\nNow Walker is taking a harder line , preparing to sign a bill in Wisconsin that would ban all abortions after 20 weeks , including in the case of rape and incest .\nThe approach appears to be currying favor for Walker among some social conservatives . Penny Young Nance , chief executive of the conservative group Concerned Women for America , said she 's grown more comfortable with Walker 's conservative credentials after spending time with him on a couple of occasions .\n`` We 're starting to see who he is , '' she said . `` I think he 's being very plainspoken and gone the extra mile to be very clear on what he believes . ''\nOthers still need some convincing . Bob Vander Plaats , chief executive of the Iowa social conservative group The Family Leader , describes his relationship with Walker as a courtship in the early stages .\n`` It 's not that we do n't believe him , '' said Vander Plaats , who will host Walker and other GOP candidates at a forum later this month . `` We have to kind of make sure that that 's a genuine belief . ''\nTaking a sharp turn to the right in order to win the top spot in Iowa and other GOP primaries is hardly a new challenge for Republicans . Social conservative firebrands Mike Huckabee , the former governor of Arkansas , and Rick Santorum , a former Pennsylvania senator , both notched victories in Iowa but failed to win broader support to clinch the nomination .\nMitt Romney 's conservative shifts in 2012 gave Democrats plenty of ammunition to paint him as a flip-flopper . In an effort to bolster his credentials with the right , Romney called for `` self-deportation '' for undocumented immigrants , a comment that haunted him in the general election and helped President Barack Obama sail to victory .\nThe far-right allure is a particular concern for Republican donors , who are tired of seeing their candidates bogged down in battles over social issues and crippling themselves with Hispanic voters . On some issues , such as gay marriage , many donors are more progressive . A number of prominent GOP donors support same-sex marriage .\nAt a recent fundraising retreat in Utah , hosted by Romney , one donor asked Walker how he would avoid being dragged into a prolonged fight over social issues . Walker said it was important to be disciplined and cognizant that a national presidential race is broader than a gubernatorial campaign in Wisconsin .\n`` I 'm a social conservative , as well as economic and fiscal one , so I do n't think that the answer is to run away from your position , '' Walker said . `` Just make it clear to the American people that this is where you stand .
