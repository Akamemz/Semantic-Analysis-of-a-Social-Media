That deadline was due to expire on 1 June, having already been extended by a month.\n\nWhat did the US announce?\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the sanctions from Paris, where he had been negotiating with EU leaders who were trying to avert the tariffs.\n\nMr Ross said talks had not made enough progress to warrant a further reprieve either for Europe or for Canada and Mexico, which are in negotiations with the US over North America's free trade agreement.\n\nMr Trump has the authority to lift the tariffs or alter them at any time, he added.\n\n\"We continue to be quite willing and indeed eager to have discussions with all those parties,\" Mr Ross said.\n\nAnalysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent\n\nThe Trump administration is determined to wring concessions from its trading partners around the world - and it's prepared to do so in belligerent style.\n\nThe President believes cheap imports harm US industry and cost US workers their jobs.
