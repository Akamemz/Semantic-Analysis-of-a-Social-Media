After accounting for upward revisions to job creation totals in October and November , the December report was the strongest jobs report of 2015 . Instead of acknowledging these facts , Varney referred to this report as \u201c modest by historical standards \u201d and lamented that it was a sign of the \u201c new normal in the Obama years. \u201d Later in the segment , Varney and guest Paul Conway , a former Bush administration official , combed through the report for kernels of negative data . Far from being \u201c modest by historical standards , \u201d in the 77-year history of the BLS monthly jobs report , only 171 of the 923 months ( 18.5 percent ) have seen job creation equal to or greater than the December 2015 total .\nVarney 's disingenuous complaint fits a trend at Fox News , where on-air personalities continue to lament consistently improving economic data .

On December 4 , 2015 , in response to a strong November report that beat most economists ' expectations , Varney still managed to conclude that the pace of job creation was \u201c mediocre . \u201d\nThe December report showed that the economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2015 and the national unemployment rate remained stable in December at 5.0 percent .
