I think it reduces the risk to New Yorkers and the residents of New Jersey , '' said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo .\nCuomo , who appeared with the governor of neighboring New Jersey , Chris Christie , at a news conference , had earlier in the day sought to reassure New Yorkers that Ebola 's threat was limited the day after Spencer tested positive for the virus .\nIn Washington , President Barack Obama also sought to reassure a worried public with an Oval Office hug of Dallas nurse Nina Pham , who was declared Ebola-free on Friday after catching the virus from a Liberian patient who died .\nBut Republican lawmakers , many of whom for weeks have called for a tougher response to Ebola , continued their criticism of the administration at a congressional hearing .\nIn the first instance of the new move by the two governors , a female healthcare worker who had treated patients in West Africa and arrived at the Newark , New Jersey , airport was ordered into quarantine .\nCuomo said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) had agreed that individual states have the right to exceed federal requirements .\nA federal quarantine of healthcare workers returning to the United States from the three West African countries was one of a number of options being discussed by administration officials , Tom Skinner , a CDC spokesman , told Reuters .\nDr. Spencer , 33 , who spent a month with the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders in Guinea , was the fourth person diagnosed with the virus in the United States and the first in its largest city .\nDr. Mary Travis Bassett , New York 's health commissioner , said Spencer was awake and talking to family and friends by cellphone and was listed in stable condition in Bellevue Hospital 's isolation unit .\nThe Obama administration has implemented a series of steps aimed at preventing the further spread of Ebola in the United States but has stopped short of a travel ban on people from Liberia , Sierra Leone or Guinea called for by some politicians .\nThe United States is funneling travelers from those countries through five airports conducting special screening for signs of infection and is requiring them to report to health authorities for the 21-day Ebola virus incubation period . The airports include a New York City airport and a New Jersey airport that serve the metropolitan area .\n`` We want to strike the right balance of doing what is best to protect the public 's health while not impeding whatsoever our ability to combat the epidemic in West Africa . Our risk here will not be zero until we stop the epidemic there , '' Skinner said .\nPham , one of two nurses from a Dallas hospital infected with Ebola after treating the first patient diagnosed with the disease in the United States , walked out smiling and unassisted from the Bethesda , Maryland , hospital where she was treated .\nEmory University Hospital in Atlanta and the CDC also confirmed that the other nurse , Amber Vinson , no longer had detectable levels of virus but did not set a date for her to leave that facility .\nPham , who was transferred to the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center in Bethesda , Maryland , from the Dallas hospital on Oct. 16 , thanked her doctors at a news briefing .\nLooking fit in a dark blazer and a turquoise blouse , Pham said that even though she no longer is infected , `` I know that it may be a while before I have my strength back . '' She said she looked forward to seeing her family and her dog .\nPhotos of the Oval Office meeting showed Obama hugging Pham . Reporters and television cameras were not allowed in for the meeting .\nDr. Anthony Fauci , director of the NIH 's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said he could not pinpoint any one factor that contributed to Pham 's speedy recovery .

Kennedy International Airport in New York on Oct. 17 . Six days later , he was quarantined at Bellevue Hospital with Ebola . The three previous cases diagnosed in the United States were in Dallas .\nThree people who had close contact with Spencer were quarantined for observation . The doctor 's fianc\u00e9e was among them and was isolated at the same hospital , and all three were still healthy , officials said .\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said city health department detectives were retracing all the steps taken by Spencer , but said the doctor poses no threat to others and urged New Yorkers to stick to their daily routines .\nHealth officials emphasized that the virus is not airborne but is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person who is showing symptoms .\nRepublican Representative Darrell Issa of California , who chairs the House of Representatives Oversight Committee , blasted the `` bumbling '' administration response , saying it had been characterized by missteps and ill-considered procedures to protect U.S. healthcare workers at home and troops in West Africa .\nLocal officials told New Yorkers they were safe even though Spencer had ridden subways , taken a cab and visited a bowling alley in Brooklyn between his return from Guinea and the onset of symptoms .
