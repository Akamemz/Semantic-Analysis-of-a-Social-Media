Since then , CNN 's reporting has expanded to include numerous other VA hospitals , culminating with details about secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA that may have played a role in the deaths of 40 veterans .\nPresident Barack Obama went before reporters at the White House minutes after meeting with Shinseki , saying the retired Army general told him `` the VA needs new leadership '' to address widespread issues that were chronicled in new reports this week .

We need to fix the problem , '' Obama said .\nCalls for Shinseki 's resignation snowballed in recent days from across the political spectrum -- Republicans and Democrats , as well as veterans ' advocacy groups -- because of the misconduct .\nIn a farewell message to VA employees , Shinseki did n't address the scandal specifically but did say he resigned with veterans ' interests in mind .\n`` My personal and professional commitment and my loyalty to veterans , their families and our survivors was the driving force behind that decision , '' he said . `` That loyalty has never wavered , and it will never wane . ''\nShinseki says 'situation can be fixed , ' but not by him\nEarlier Friday , Shinseki announced steps to address the VA shortcomings , including removing senior leaders in the Phoenix VA medical system , eliminating performance awards for VA leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans .\nHe also apologized to veterans and Congress , but declared : `` This situation can be fixed . ''\nHe went to the White House to present Obama with findings from his internal audit of what was happening in the VA system , including that many audited facilities had `` questionable scheduling practices '' that signaled a `` systemic lack of integrity . ''\nThe President acknowledged that scheduling issues did n't rise to the attention of Shinseki , whom he praised as a man who `` has served his country with honor for nearly 50 years . ''\nAt the same time , Obama said that he and Shinseki agreed that a shift in leadership was necessary .\nFor now , Sloan Gibson -- a Shinseki deputy -- will head the VA until a new secretary is named and confirmed .\n`` Part of that is going to be technology . Part of that is management , '' the President said . `` But as Ric Shinseki himself indicated , there is a need for a change in culture within the VHA , and perhaps the VHA as a whole -- or the VA as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed .

''\nThe latest report by the VA inspector general 's office and Shinseki 's auditors indicated a link between employee bonuses and covering up patient wait times .\nThere also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record-keeping to cover up delays at VA hospitals . Obama said Friday that would be up to the Justice Department , which has been collecting information but has not launched any investigation .\nShortly before he resigned , Shinseki told a veterans group that he was shocked by the inspector general 's report , especially the prevalence of wait lists for veterans needing medical care .\n`` That breach of integrity is irresponsible , it is indefensible and unacceptable to me , '' he told the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans just before heading over to his final meeting with Obama .\n`` I said when this situation began weeks to months ago and I thought the problem was limited and isolated because I believed that . I no longer believe that . It is systemic , '' he said .\nAt the same time , the VA chief of more than five years said that others had misled him .\n`` I was too trusting of some , and I accepted as accurate reports that I now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait times , '' he said . `` I ca n't explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our health care facilities .
