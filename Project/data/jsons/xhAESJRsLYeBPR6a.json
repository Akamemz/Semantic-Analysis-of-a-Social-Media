While this was probably inevitable , given that 330 million people live in America , it is painful -- equally for me as an American and as a Jew .\nAnd second , while there is no difference between the murder of Christians at a church and the murder of Jews in a synagogue with regard to the loss of life and the suffering of loved ones , there is something unique about the murder of Jews for being Jews : Anti-Semitism is exterminationist .
