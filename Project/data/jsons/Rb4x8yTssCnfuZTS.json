Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nMay 1 is an official public holiday in 66 countries , including most of Europe . Other than a couple of faith-based holidays and the start of the new year , there \u2019 s hardly a holiday that spans so many nations . With its roots in ancient agrarian celebrations of spring , the official public holiday on May 1 is International Workers Day , celebrating the extraordinary contributions of workers and the working class . In countries where it \u2019 s an official day off , and 100 other nations , it is often commemorated with marches , protests , or strikes . Ad Policy\nBut here in the United States , the date is barely known beyond those immigrants whose home countries honor it , or among the most committed labor activists . Yet May Day commemorates the lives of four labor organizers in the United States who were hanged in Chicago after being falsely convicted of throwing a bomb into a group of police .\nThe lead-up to what became known as the Haymarket Massacre was a call to shorten the workday with no pay cut . In 1884 , the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions ( precursor to the American Federation of Labor ) voted at its annual convention that from May 1 , 1886 , onward , the workday would consist of eight hours . Thus on May 1 , 1886 , peaceful protests took place in many US cities , with hundreds of thousands walking off the job . In Chicago , a second consecutive day of action drew crowds to a steel mill that was the site of an ongoing labor dispute . When police attacked the protesters , two workers were killed and dozens injured . The organizers hastily called for people to take to the streets for a third day in the city \u2019 s Haymarket Square to protest the killings . During this protest a bomb was thrown at the police . In the ensuing melee , seven police officers and at least four civilians were killed , with dozens of others wounded .\nDiagnosing the problem as \u201c an acute outbreak of anarchy , \u201d The New York Times prescribed the application of \u201c a Gatling gun \u201d followed by \u201c hemp , in judicious doses. \u201d Eight organizers of the Haymarket Square protest were arrested , and despite no evidence to connect them to the bombing\u2014several were not even in the square at the time\u2014four were executed in August of 1886 . A fifth defendant committed suicide before being hanged , and three others who were convicted were later fully exonerated and released from jail . The charges against the activists were obviously trumped up , intended to quell growing labor unrest in Chicago and the country at large .

October 15 , 2019 Author page\nLess than 10 years and several massive strikes later , President Grover Cleveland declared the first Monday in September as Labor Day , an action designed explicitly to sever \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s working class from their counterparts across the globe , as well as give the appearance that the Democratic Party cared about workers while it was brutally repressing strikes . With the exception of the May 1 , 2006 , the \u201c Day Without an Immigrant \u201d \u2014arguably the biggest strike by labor in the United States in decades\u2014International Workers Day has hardly registered here . This isn \u2019 t surprising : Despite the applause for health care workers whose employers are killing them by denying them personal protective equipment , workers and the working class are not valued in the United States . The rot of our democracy lies in the indignation with which the political elite casts aside the daily contributions of workers , both paid and unpaid . From housewives and mothers , rendered insignificant except for the unpaid , unofficial , Hallmark-card holiday called Mother \u2019 s Day , to immoral prison labor , to agricultural workers toiling in slave-like conditions in fields stretching from Deep South Louisiana to chic California to the verdant apple orchards of the Empire State , tens of millions had been exploited and uncompensated for a long time before a record 26.5 million Americans filed unemployment claims because of the pandemic .\nAmazon workers are being fired for standing up for their own health protection needs . Registered nurses are being fired for coming to work with a garbage bag covering their scrubs and posting the pictures on social media on their own time , suggesting that their protective equipment is as good as trash bags . Then there \u2019 s the outrageous series of federal bailouts designed to fatten the over-bulging pockets of CEOs and shareholders while intentionally starving workers of wages , health care , food , rent , heat , and any damned dignity at all . Mitch McConnell \u2019 s musings\u2014that he has no intention of helping local and state governments alleviate the crushing pain of millions of people being laid off , because the free market won \u2019 t produce equipment or testing or do a goddamned thing to stop the devastation\u2014makes it clear that the bailouts are also designed to be a cudgel , intentionally destroying public service workers \u2019 hard-earned pensions in the name of post-Covid austerity . Current Issue View our current issue\nRecently passed federal policy , starting with the 2017 tax cut for the rich and ending with the pandemic \u2019 s corporate bailouts , engorges the super rich by sucking the lifeblood from workers . Homelessness , car repossessions , and hunger are the reward for every bit of profit the workers have earned for the plutocrats in Silicon Valley and Wall Street . Thinking about May Day can feel revolting in the United States , where workers need a lot more than another holiday . Although , to be clear , many of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s workers get no holidays , no days off , no vacation , in addition to no health care , no homes , and no pension .\nThe number of unemployed workers is now reaching Great Depression levels .

They somehow\u2014right up until Covid\u2014consistently reported that the economy was doing fine and Wall Street was up , ignoring decades of massive underemployment , sinking wages ; rising numbers of personal bankruptcies due to health problems ; rising credit card debt ; rising opioid addictions ; and rising suicide rates .\nThe number that should be increasing is the one documenting strikes and the number of workers on strike over the past two years . Trump-appointed corporate lackeys have all but destroyed the National Labor Relations Board , the agency intended to protect workers \u2019 rights . After suspending unionization elections in the name of Covid when workers were desperate to unionize , then cynically restoring them to hold what are called decertification elections ( the process by which workers can vote out a union ) , the NLRB has left workers in the United States no real choice but to act as if they had an effective union .

We need to begin strike plans for what we really need : Medicare for All , and an aggressively pro-union Green New Deal guaranteeing all workers in the current fossil fuel sector can keep their current union contracts , while enabling \u201c essential \u201d workers in low-carbon-emission sectors ( home care and child care workers , those that harvest and deliver our food , etc . ) to achieve new collective agreements as good as those in the energy sector . We need to plan strikes this fall , in 2021 , 2022 , and up to 2024 , where solidarity pledges are signed by tens of millions of workers : \u201c None of us go back until all of us achieve health care free at the point of service , national guaranteed sick leave , vacation leave , a just society and a functioning democracy . \u201d\nEvery strike I \u2019 ve had the pleasure of helping to lead involved variations of solidarity pledges , which are literal , signed statements , public commitments organized work area by work area , shift by shift , so workers could wrestle up-front with the hard decisions to stay out longer for one another , and thus for all of us .
