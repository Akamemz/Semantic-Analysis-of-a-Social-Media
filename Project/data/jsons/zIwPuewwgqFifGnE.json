    "content": "If Barack Obama and David Axelrod had their druthers , every American voter would have a certain impression of Mitt Romney : An exceedingly wealthy , secretive , greedy robber baron , using his substantial means to identify and exploit small businesses -- sucking them dry of capital , bankrupting them , and laying off all the hard-working employees , leaving a trail of human misery and destruction in his wake . After distributing those pink slips , he cackles and rubs his hands together while depositing his obscene profits into his off-shore bank account somewhere , then it 's on to the next victim . This is the cartoon liberals have painted of Romney , spending tens of millions of dollars on negative ads . It 's mean-spirited fantasy . Yes , Mitt Romney built an exceptional private sector career . Americans tend to celebrate that sort of thing . But he 's also a faithful , honorable , compassionate family man whose generosity and kindness has n't gotten nearly enough attention , at least until last night . Three speeches during the closing session of the Republican National Convention shed light on the private deeds and values of the party 's nominee for president . I 'd bet that the Romney 's were n't thrilled by the prospect of airing their private ( squeaky-clean ) laundry for all the world to see because bragging about doing the right thing feels unseemly . But given the assault on Mitt Romney 's character and the consequential nature of the election , they relented and decided to allow others to sketch out those elements of Mitt 's life on his behalf . Kate touched on one of these speeches earlier . I can not possibly share these vignettes any better than the speakers themselves . The hall was silent , and few eyes remained dry during these extraordinary testimonials :\nMy eyes welled up again just posting these videos . I could n't help by feel pangs of profound compassion for these families , and genuine gladness that a man as fine as Mitt Romney was active in their lives to comfort and help them during their struggles . Where is the monstrous , avaricious , uncaring money robot we 're always warned about in these anecdotes ? He 's nowhere to be found because he does n't exist . This truth transcends partisanship . Another speaker at the convention was Jane Edmonds -- a member of Governor Romney 's Massachusetts cabinet and a lifelong liberal Democrat . She chose to speak out for her former boss because of his integrity , not his platform :\nIn an interview with Politico , Edmonds explained her decision to appear at the convention of a political party she does n't support :\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t come here to talk about our differences \u2014 I \u2019 m not going down that path , \u201d Edmonds said in an interview . \u201c I \u2019 m here to talk about my experiences working for him .
