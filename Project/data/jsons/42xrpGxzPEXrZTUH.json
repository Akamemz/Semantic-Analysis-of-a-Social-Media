    "content": "In Chicago \u2019 s South Side earlier this month , a 16-year-old boy was shot dead , the seventh person killed this year in the West Garfield Park neighborhood .\nThe boy was able to give his name and reportedly pleaded with the responding police officers , \u201c Please don \u2019 t let me die . \u201d\nIf you live in 60624 , the ZIP code where the shooting took place , you don \u2019 t expect your streets to be safe . In the last 30 days , that neighborhood has recorded more homicides , robberies , assaults , thefts and narcotics charges combined than any other ZIP code in Cook County when measured on a per capita basis . Its population is 98 percent black and averages a median income just above the poverty line .\nIt also is one of the ZIP codes that registers the fewest active concealed carry firearms permits per capita in the county , according to concealed carry numbers obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nDitto for the crime-ridden neighborhoods of Englewood and West Englewood . Combined with West Garfield Park , out of their 114,933 total residents , only 193 concealed carry licenses have been issued \u2014 less than 0.17 percent of the population .\nIt \u2019 s a completely different story in affluent Palos Park , located in southwestern Cook County . The 60464 ZIP code boasts a negligible crime rate : Only one homicide has been committed in 10 years , according to the most recent state police data . Ninety-six percent of its residents are white , earning an average income of $ 121,000 .\nIt also has the most concealed carry licenses in Cook County this year , with 1.24 percent of its residents authorized to carry a gun .\nThe majority of Illinois \u2019 73,714 active concealed carry licenses \u2014 90 percent \u2014 have been issued to white people , demographic data shows . Only eight percent of African-Americans have secured licenses , according to the FOIA information .\nWithin Cook County , the top five concealed carry ZIP codes per capita are all predominately white , middle class and are in areas that have low crime rates . However , the most violent neighborhoods within the county \u2014 all of which are on the South Side of Chicago \u2014 are predominately black , where residents earn less than $ 48,000 annually and hold the fewest concealed carry licenses as a percentage of the population .\nIf the same data trends occurred in banking and insurance , there might be outcries of \u201c redlining , \u201d denying a group of people access to goods or services because of the color of their skin or income levels . But there \u2019 s little public concern expressed so far about the possibility that poor blacks are being disenfranchised from the right to carry a concealed weapon .\n\u201c You really need to ask whether or not politicians are consciously trying to disarm certain groups of people , \u201d said Dr. John Lott , a Second Amendment expert and president of the Crime Prevention Research Center . \u201c Why do they want a law that primarily disarms blacks and gives guns to only well-to-do whites ? Don \u2019 t they think it should be equal for everyone to protect their lives ? \u201d\nIllinois residents say the disproportionate statistics all boil down to cost . Of right-to-carry states , Illinois has the highest registration and training fee , costing an applicant about $ 650 on average for fingerprinting , taxes and logistics \u2014 excluding the price of the gun .\n\u201c In these gangbang neighborhoods , people can \u2019 t afford the license . They \u2019 re making choices between food and medicine , and they can \u2019 t even guarantee they \u2019 ll get even that , \u201d said Shawn Gowder , 49 , who lives in Chicago \u2019 s Auburn Gresham neighborhood on the South Side , where two homicides have taken place in the last 30 days . \u201c We need to arm ourselves and protect ourselves from these gangbangers , but we just can \u2019 t afford to do it . \u201d\nIllinois also has the longest training requirements of right-to-carry states , requiring potential licensees to take a 16-hour course that includes range time . There are no gun ranges within the city of Chicago , and carrying an unlicensed gun on public transportation is a crime .\n\u201c There are a lot of systematic and economic barriers that make it difficult for South Side of Chicago residents , many of whom are African-American , to obtain concealed carry permits , \u201d said George Mitchell , president of the NAACP Illinois State Conference . \u201c Some of the barriers include the high costs , time commitment , bureaucracy and the community \u2019 s distrust of the police . \u201d\nMr. Gowder is one of Auburn \u2019 s 292 residents who saved money to get a concealed carry permit as soon as the state began processing requests this January . As a U.S. veteran , Mr. Gowder values his right to carry but says the cost of obtaining a license in Chicago has prohibited his mother and girlfriend from doing the same , which he believes is vital to their safety .\nWhen Colorado passed its gun control law , there was an amendment that looked at exempting people below the poverty level from having to pay transfer fees to help make the cost of carrying a little more equitable , Mr. Lott said . It was unanimously voted down , he said .\nIn addition to the high price tag , Mr. Gowder attributes an uninformed public for the disparity in Cook County ownership . When a U.S. court struck down Illinois \u2019 ban on concealed carry last year , most of his friends didn \u2019 t follow the news , and now they don \u2019 t know it \u2019 s legal for them to own and carry a firearm .\n\u201c It \u2019 s one of the best-kept secrets in the state . Chicago \u2019 s politicians aren \u2019 t even informing us this is an option , \u201d said Mr. Gowder . \u201c It \u2019 s people like me getting out the word . As soon as the criminals know more of us are armed , the crime rates will drop . \u201d\nMr. Gowder , who is an African-American , asked Alderman Latasha R. Thomas to hold a precinct meeting to educate the population on their right to carry . She declined . Ms. Thomas didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment from The Times .\nMs. Thomas \u2019 reluctance is not surprising . Chicago politicians have long been against concealed carry , being of the mindset that more guns leads to more violence , no matter who is packing . And with Chicago being dubbed the \u201c murder capital \u201d last fall after it had more homicides than any other U.S. city in the FBI \u2019 s 2012 Crime Statistics release , politicians are even more sensitive to the issue .\nWhen Illinois became the final state to allow its citizens to apply for concealed carry , it applied a loophole that allows local law enforcement to deny permits for any reason . The Cook County Sheriff \u2019 s office has said it would like to object to as many concealed carry applicants as it can worry about .\nThe county \u2019 s objections are then passed on to a seven-person state review board , which delays the process and can deny the license . So far the state board has denied more than 800 licenses without any explanation . The denials have prompted almost 200 Illinoisans to file lawsuits against the state police to try to get justification .\n\u201c The Cook County sheriff , if you ever had anything on your record ever , he will request a denial , \u201d said Richard Pearson , executive director of the Illinois State Rifle Association . \u201c We have some guys getting denied for having a DWI , having to go to a few hours of rehab as part of their charge , and then having the sheriff come back and say that \u2019 s a mental disability and rule against them . \u201d\nCook County Sheriff Thomas J . Dart declined comment when contacted by The Times .\nSonny Brown , a retired part-time police officer who lives in Bellwood , 13 miles west from Chicago \u2019 s Inner Loop , admits the probability of being denied in Cook County is a deterrent to some in the inner cities who may want to legally obtain a license .\n\u201c Some people have a record , you know . It \u2019 s called driving while black , \u201d said Mr. Brown , 66 , who has applied for his license and is waiting on its approval . \u201c The politicians don \u2019 t care if this saves lives or even consider the fact when concealed carry goes up , violent crime rates go down . All they want to do is stifle our Second Amendment rights . \u201d\nNot true , says State Senator Kwame Raoul , a South Side Democrat .\n\u201c I do appreciate law-abiding gun owners wanting to be able to protect themselves , \u201d said Mr. Raoul . \u201c However , the problem we have with gun violence happens with illegal transfers . [ For ] a large part perpetrators of violence are not people who legally own guns , but they are people who got their guns from people who legally obtained them . \u201d\nPart of the reason for the pricey concealed carry application fee is to cover the state cost associated with processing the licenses , doing background checks and setting up the infrastructure necessary to make sure private gun transfers are done legally , Mr. Raoul said .\nOf the $ 150 fee , $ 20 dollars goes to the state to support mental health , $ 10 to state crime labs and $ 10 to the state \u2019 s firearm owner identification cards , which is required to purchase a gun and ammunition .\nAs for the belief that higher concealed carry lowers crime rates , Mr. Raoul isn \u2019 t so sure .\n\u201c People can pull out and manipulate statistics . I don \u2019 t know if it \u2019 s true or not , \u201d said Mr. Raoul . \u201c It just seems the more guns we have out there , the more accidents we \u2019 re likely to have , and the more illegal gun transfers there \u2019 ll be . \u201d",
