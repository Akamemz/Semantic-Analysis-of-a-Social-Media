This year , however , the gap all but vanished , with trust in government in particular plummeting 30 percentage points among the informed public .

Eighty-four percent of Chinese respondents said they trusted government\u2014levels the United States hasn \u2019 t seen since the early Johnson administration\u2014and 71 percent said they trusted the media .
