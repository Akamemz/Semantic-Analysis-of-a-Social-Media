They added that Mr. Obama \u2019 s habit of taking U.S. allies for granted also is on full display when it comes to South Sudan \u2014 which commemorated its first anniversary as an independent country this week .\n\u201c I think the South Sudanese feel they \u2019 ve been abandoned and the United States is working more as a neutral mediator than as an advocate on their behalf , \u201d said Andrew Natsios , a special adviser to the Romney campaign who headed the U.S. Agency for International Development under President Bush in the early 2000s .\nWere Mr. Romney president , added Richard Williamson , another of the campaign \u2019 s foreign policy advisers , he would \u201c provide political leadership \u201d in confronting Lt. Gen. Bashir , who continues to hold the Sudanese presidency despite having been indicted on war-crimes charges by the U.N.-backed International Criminal Court .\nMr. Romney also would push for an accelerated deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in an attempt to \u201c crowd out the violence \u201d in key areas between Sudan and newly independent South Sudan , Mr. Williamson said .\nFighting has erupted along the border between the two nations since last year , when South Sudan \u2019 s secession from the north triggered a dispute over revenue from the region \u2019 s oil fields .\nTens of thousands of people have become refugees as a result of violence in the Blue Nile and Nuba Mountains \u2014 regions of northern Sudan that were aligned with the south during the 22 years of civil war that preceded South Sudanese independence .\nIn addition to blocking the flow of humanitarian aid to regions now , Gen. Bashir \u2019 s northern Sudanese fighter jets have pounded villages in the two regions during the past year .\nThat the Romney campaign homed in on the issue this week raised the eyebrows of close Sudan watchers in Washington , including some Democrats critical of the Obama administration for not following through on its 2008 campaign promises to take a hard-line stand against Gen. Bashir .\nBut the extent to which Mr. Romney would take a truly different approach from President Obama \u2019 s remains to be seen , and questions swirled this week over how closely aligned the former Massachusetts governor is to his advisers on the Sudan issue .\nMr. Natsios and Mr. Williamson served as special envoys to Sudan under Mr. Bush . Before they were tapped as advisers by the Romney campaign , both were out front on the Sudan issue , advocating for the deployment of some form of U.S. anti-aircraft to bolster the south \u2019 s defenses against strikes carried out by the north .\nNeither has been willing to get behind that position on behalf of the Romney campaign .\nIn his statement commemorating the one-year anniversary of South Sudan \u2019 s independence , Mr. Romney offered some firm generalizations but appeared to balk at the opportunity to distinguish himself aggressively from Mr. Obama .\n\u201c I believe America must play a leadership role in this process and speak clearly on the ongoing atrocities of the regime in Khartoum and the resulting refugee crisis , \u201d the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said . \u201c I am committed to protecting innocents , ensuring access to humanitarian aid and achieving a just and sustainable peace between South Sudan and Sudan . \u201d\nMr. Romney \u2019 s adherence to generalities prompted some to suggest that his true posture might not be so different from that embraced by Mr. Obama , who has put as much blame on South Sudan as on the north for the ongoing violence .\nMr. Obama went further than Mr. Romney in criticizing the Bashir government in April by asserting that Khartoum \u201c must stop its military actions , including aerial bombardments . \u201d\nThe president also said \u201c South Sudan must end its support for armed groups inside Sudan \u201d and \u201c cease its military actions across the border . \u201d\n\u201c The Obama administration has not done nearly enough , so they are to be condemned , \u201d said Eric Reeves , a leading Sudan researcher at Smith College and a staunch critic of the Bashir government . \u201c But unless Romney comes up with a specific set of proposals , he \u2019 s just mouthing platitudes and generalizations with which nobody could disagree .\n\u201c How is Romney creating space between himself and Obama ? He is highlighting some of the Obama administration \u2019 s failures , particularly around the humanitarian crises , but he could have gone a lot further .\n\u201c The U.S. policy should be to say that for every time one of Khartoum \u2019 s aircraft attacks civilians , we will respond by destroying one of their aircraft on the ground with a cruise missile , \u201d he said . \u201c That would immediately create a de-facto no-fly zone .\n\u201c Would Romney support that ? \u201d Mr. Reeves asked . \u201c That would be a great question . \u201d\nWhen that question was posed to Mr. Williamson , he said : \u201c I don \u2019 t want to put the governor in a box , and he has not taken a position on surface-to-air defense missiles , something that I pushed for in the Bush administration and Andrew Natsios has written in support of . \u201d\nAs for what Mr. Romney would do , Mr. Williamson said that \u201c when atrocities are committed , he \u2019 ll speak out against those who commit them , whereas the Obama administration has been quiet .
