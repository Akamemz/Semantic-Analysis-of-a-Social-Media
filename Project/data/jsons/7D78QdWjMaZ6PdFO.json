    "content": "DES MOINES , Iowa \u2014 After impressing Iowa Democratic activists with a stern tongue-lashing of Republicans at Friday night \u2019 s famous Wing Ding fundraiser , Hillary Clinton took a step out of her comfort zone to try to win the hearts of the Hawkeye State \u2019 s vital voters .\nShe walked out into the crowd of 2,000 politically savvy Iowans and seated herself a few rows back from the stage , listening to other candidates give stump speeches like she was an ordinary attendee . And when the fundraiser finished , and people swarmed to meet her , she took a few minutes to mingle , even signing a few autographs for awestruck fans .\nBut then she disappeared behind a makeshift black curtain walling off a corner of the ballroom . Fans pushed up against the veil , trying to get a peak of the 2016 Democratic front-runner . But her security detail held them back , allowing only a handful to enter and see the hidden candidate before she left , leaving a swarm of disappointed voters who didn \u2019 t get a handshake .\nDuring a two-day sweep of this key early-voting state , Clinton made good on a promise to be more down-to-earth and increase her face-to-face interaction with Average Joes . At the Iowa State Fair on Saturday , she mingled with strangers , took more than 40 pictures with fans and embraced the crowds she so often avoids . At her side was former Sen. Tom Harkin , whose endorsement last week came after a rough run of headlines about her private email account .\nIt \u2019 s part of an intentional Clinton campaign effort to win support in a state that rejected her last time she ran for the White House in part because they felt she put on airs , snubbing Iowans who are used to \u2014 and expect \u2014 up-close-and-personal meetings with presidential wannabes .\nThe question is whether Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 vintage is different and better enough to overcome the growing questions about her candidacy .\nWhile many Iowa Democrats praised her for a notable change in strategy , interviews with dozens of others showed she still has some work to do if she wants to win the Iowa Democratic caucuses . Many liberals are still skeptical that she \u2019 s actually one of them . Others say she needs to do more rallies or open up invite-only , small-group events to wider audiences who yearn to know Hillary , the person . And there \u2019 s real interest among Democrats about a possible late entry into the race : Vice President Joe Biden .\nCase in point : Jackie Crawford , whose brother Jerry is a major Iowan fixer for the Clintons . She chatted with Clinton at the Iowa State Fair about horse racing \u2014 a passion her brother shares with his buddy Bill Clinton \u2014 but after the masses following Clinton moved on , she said there \u2019 s no doubt Clinton could do more to win .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 d be good to get her out more in larger groups \u2026 more question-and-answer , \u201d she said , adding that she \u2019 ll back Clinton \u2014 \u201c unless Joe should run . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a sign that Clinton still has some work to do . Although she leads her most competitive Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders by at least 20 percentage points , the Vermont senator , a darling of the left , is gaining ground and wooing potential supporters .\nAnd if Biden jumps into the race , her odds here look even worse . Numerous Iowans told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they adore his devil-may-care personality and would welcome him throwing his hat into the ring \u2014 some because of the email controversy plaguing Clinton in Washington , D.C .\n\u201c I \u2019 m all in \u201d on Biden , said J.R. Ackley , the former two-time mayor and city councilman of a 300-population northern Iowa town called Marble Rock . \u201c I think Hillary \u2019 s going to be bogged down by a lot of this Benghazi stuff . \u201d\nA nervous Clinton campaign is leaving nothing to chance . Her third-place finish here in 2008 was a huge blow to the woman who was , then as now , the assumed nominee . She went on to battle Barack Obama well into the spring , but in some ways never recovered from losing Iowa . Obama \u2019 s stance against the Iraq war was surely a major factor behind Clinton \u2019 s defeat , but her campaign has clearly accepted the conventional wisdom in Iowa that her imperial , coronate-me-now style of 2008 played a large role .\nThey \u2019 ve beefed up their Iowa-based staff , begun a massive volunteer organizing effort and put together a number of small group events and roundtables . She \u2019 s held town halls in multiple cities , including Iowa City , Ames and Dubuque as recently as last week . And moves like Clinton \u2019 s carefully spontaneous \u2018 Scooby Doo van ride \u2019 in April went over vastly better than anything she did here in 2008 .\nSo far , it \u2019 s working \u2014 at least with some Iowans .\nRichard Paxson , who sits on the Cerro Gordo County Democratic committee , said she \u2019 s changed .\n\u201c I was at a house meeting that Hillary had in Mason City , and there were about 100 people there , and she took the time to meet and visit with every single person in the room , \u201d said Paxson , who voted for Obama in 2008 . \u201c I found that very impressive . \u201d\nAfter her Wing Ding speech Friday night , Steve Jules , an event organizer , approached this reporter waving a picture of Hillary he had taken months ago \u2014 that she had just signed for him minutes ago . He looked like a giddy child who had just been handed a cookie , grinning from ear to ear : \u201c Fantastic ! \u201d\nJohn Colombo , another event organizer , said that moments like these show \u201c the campaign learned from the mistakes of 2007 . \u201d\n\u201c This time around it \u2019 s a completely different candidate , \u201d he said in an interview just before the chicken wing fundraiser Friday , donned in a red , white and blue Uncle Sam suit for the occasion . \u201c We \u2019 re Iowans . We like to meet people\u2026 to shake their hand and actually know who they are . I don \u2019 t think that she really understood that about us then , but this year\u2026 they \u2019 re defiantly running a better campaign \u2014 a lot more personal . \u201d\nSupporters say she \u2019 s listening , too . Colombo , for example , said he had asked her several months ago at a private event to talk about trade programs in education \u2014 then saw her bring up that very issue in a speech two weeks later .\nClinton often notes such efforts to be responsive , as she did during a gaggle with reporters at the Iowa State Fair Saturday , saying she recently started looking at mental health policy after someone in Iowa had asked her to do so : \u201c I want to have this continuing conversation about what \u2019 s on the minds of Iowans and Americans and I will fight as hard as I can to earn every vote . \u201d\nDuring the fair , reporters witnessed her stepping out , too . While Clinton is notorious for avoiding big crowds , she walked around the fairgrounds talking to anyone who approached her or asked to snap a picture . An Iowa mother with a daughter on her deathbed pleaded with her to make medical marijuana legal nationally \u2014 Clinton took her contact info down . A young boy introduced her to his show cow . All of that seemed to go over well .\nBut there \u2019 s still a left-leaning crowd here in Iowa who \u2019 s not so sure about her .\n\u201c I like her , but I don \u2019 t like her , \u201d said Leslie Johnson , a few feet away from the fair \u2019 s famous \u201c soapbox , \u201d which Clinton notably avoided Saturday . \u201c I don \u2019 t trust her . \u201d\nA lot of their distrust has to do with policy . Multiple people in the crowd of several hundred that came out to hear Clinton \u2019 s competitor Bernie Sanders speak noted disapprovingly that she hadn \u2019 t weighed in on the trade pacts that recently split President Obama from the rest of his party . Or the creation of the Keystone pipeline that liberals here believe will crush the environment . They don \u2019 t like that she \u2019 s friendly with Wall Street , either .\n\u201c The progressive wing doesn \u2019 t feel like she stands up enough , \u201d said Nathan Riggle of Des Moines , a 20-something who worked for the Obama campaign in 2008 and is currently undecided . If he had to bet , he \u2019 d put his money on Sanders winning Iowa . \u201c She \u2019 s just more conservative than we \u2019 d like her to be . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s more than just the issues . It \u2019 s access too .\n\u201c She didn \u2019 t show up here for the Des Moines Register soapbox , \u201d said Iowan Charlie Aherm , who wore a Sanders shirt and stood outside of a line-dancing tent at the fair . He complained that Clinton was \u201c too professional \u201d and too closed off . \u201c I don \u2019 t know where she is . I heard that she was here today but I didn \u2019 t see her . \u201d\nLarry Dunn , an Iowa Democrat who \u2019 s leaning toward Sanders , was bitter about not being invited to private events Clinton has held here in Iowa .\n\u201c When she was here two months , she had a private party , \u201d he complained .\n\u201c The public wasn \u2019 t invited , \u201d his wife Deb added aghast . \u201c Bernie \u2019 s been making himself available \u2026 anybody could come . \u201d\nThe Clinton campaign has held number of free events open to the public , though some of Iowa \u2019 s left here didn seem to know about them .\nTory Fellner , who is undecided on a candidate , said she wants to back Hillary but is not impressed with her accessibility . While she \u2019 s already seen Sanders at three public events , she \u2019 s yet to meet Clinton in person .\n\u201c Bernie is out there stumping , and I understand that she \u2019 s a little more reserved , but I think she needs to put herself out there , \u201d said Fellner , who had a plate of pulled pork on her lap at the Wing Ding event Friday . \u201c I understand she \u2019 s all over the country , and you can only be in one place at a time , but in Iowa we have an expectation that we get to meet these people [ who run ] \u2026 and I \u2019 m waiting for Hillary. \u201d she said .\nStanding next to a horde of chanting Martin O \u2019 Malley supporters in Clear Lake on Friday afternoon , Daryl Kothenbeutel predicted that Sanders will be the Obama of 2008 , soon overtaking Clinton in the polls and driving on to win the state for the left .\n\u201c He \u2019 s already ahead in New Hampshire , \u201d he noted . Clinton \u201c has too much baggage . \u201d\nJohn Stone , the Cerro Gordo County Democratic Chairman , said it \u2019 s certainly possible . Though he backed Clinton over Obama last time around , he said he \u2019 s holding his cards closely .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen people picked as the winner in the caucus beforehand , but we \u2019 ve got about six months to go and a lot can happen , \u201d he said .",
