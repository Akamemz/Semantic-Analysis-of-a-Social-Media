The new poll also showed that net approval of the president \u2019 s handling of the economy is slightly underwater , with 46 percent approving and 47 percent disapproving . This is notable , as the public has been more receptive to Trump \u2019 s handling of the economy compared to other issues . The president has \u2014 at least in part \u2014 attached his reelection fortunes to strong economic conditions .
