    "content": "Just months after the downfall of producer Harvey Weinstein and the rise of the current # MeToo movement , once-powerful men are already thinking about their comebacks .\nBill O \u2019 Reilly is in talks with Newsmax TV to host a new show in his old 8 PM time slot , according to Page Six .\nLast month , Page Six also reported that Matt Lauer was \u201c testing the waters \u201d for a comeback \u201c by coming out of hiding from his Hamptons home. \u201d Mario Batali is reportedly thinking of starting a new company . Garrison Keillor is touring again , and wants to bring back his radio shows .\nSome of the comeback chatter has come from media outlets rather than directly from the men . Charlie Rose was the subject of a recent profile in the Hollywood Reporter detailing his post-firing media diet and exercise regimen ( 10 newspapers a day ; tennis ) and examining what \u201c earning back his good name \u201d might look like . The same publication also recently asked comedians and club owners how Louis C.K . \u201c could return to the stage ... and the spotlight. \u201d ( Comebacks by once-powerful men appear to be a bit of a trend lately , whether or not they were accused as part of # MeToo \u2014 former national security adviser Michael Flynn has begun making speaking appearances and recently told Politico he is \u201c doing great . \u201d )\nWhatever the source , talk of comebacks at this early date risks replicating one of the flaws critics saw in earlier phases of the # MeToo conversation : an excessive focus on individual men to the exclusion of the systemic factors that allowed them to harass colleagues with impunity . As women came forward to report harassment and assault in recent months , \u201c the main reaction was punishing bad actors , as though that behavior was not institutionally supported , \u201d said Sheerine Alemzadeh , co-founder of Healing to Action , a nonprofit that helps workers advocate against gender-based violence .\nIt \u2019 s worthwhile to consider whether and how powerful people ousted from their jobs over sexual misconduct should be allowed to redeem themselves . But first , the companies and industries where these people operated need to think about their redemption , making sure they identify and change the practices that protected and enabled abusers for too long .\nIn the wake of high-profile firings , some organizations are instituting new training and policies . But experts worry that too few companies are asking the hard questions necessary for real change . And if they don \u2019 t , the abuses that led to # MeToo in the first place are likely to happen again .\nFor some powerful men , the comeback talk began after just a few months\nPundits have been talking about \u201c rehabilitating \u201d powerful men accused of sexual misconduct since at least early December \u2014 and Weinstein was talking about a \u201c second chance \u201d in mid-October , just days after the New York Times first reported on his legal settlements with multiple women accusing him of harassment . So it \u2019 s perhaps no surprise that some men are reportedly mulling comebacks not long after leaving their jobs .\nBill O \u2019 Reilly was ousted from Fox News in April 2017 after multiple sexual harassment allegations against him came to light . Now he \u2019 s in talks to host a new show on conservative cable and streaming network Newsmax TV , according to Page Six .\nMatt Lauer was fired from his job as the co-host of NBC \u2019 s Today show in late November , after a female subordinate reported inappropriate sexual behavior by him . Soon , more women came forward , including one who said he sexually assaulted her in his office , causing her to pass out .\nOn April 16 , Richard Johnson of Page Six reported that Lauer was \u201c said to be testing the waters for a public comeback \u201d and had been spotted at an upscale restaurant in Manhattan with Mitch Modell of Modell \u2019 s Sporting Goods . \u201c With his marriage to Annette Roque now over , he \u2019 s ready to restart his life , pals say , \u201d Johnson wrote .\nIn December of last year , Batali stepped away from his restaurants after four women told Eater that he had touched them inappropriately in incidents spanning two decades . The New York Times also reported that Batali had been seen in 2008 groping a woman who appeared to be unconscious at a party in a space at the Spotted Pig restaurant that some employees darkly called \u201c the rape room . \u201d\nIn early April , less than four months later , Kim Severson of the New York Times reported that Batali was taking meetings \u201c to figure out how his life and career might recover from a disastrous turn. \u201d Batali had \u201c sketched several scenarios that put him in the driver \u2019 s seat but cede some control , \u201d Severson reported , including creating a new company that would be led by a woman CEO , or starting a program for chefs to help displaced Rwandans . \u201c On the other hand , \u201d Severson wrote , \u201c he might just move to the Amalfi Coast . \u201d\nGarrison Keillor , meanwhile , was dropped from Minnesota Public Radio in late November due , the network said , to allegations of inappropriate behavior with an employee . Keillor claimed all he had done was pat a woman on the back , but in January , an MPR investigation uncovered allegations by multiple women across many years . Keillor has been defiant in the face of allegations against him , saying that one woman who complained about his behavior \u201c enjoyed flirtation , as many people do . \u201d\nIn April , he posted on his Facebook page that he was ready to resurrect his poetry radio show , The Writer \u2019 s Almanac . \u201c I get the idea that public radio stations will never carry it again and so we \u2019 ll need to find a way to do it through social media , \u201d he wrote . \u201c There are smart people who can manage this and make it easy . \u201d\nHe also said he wanted to take his famous show A Prairie Home Companion on tour again . And in March , he resumed giving solo performances incorporating songs and storytelling , commenting onstage in Prescott , Arizona , about \u201c the beauty of being disgraced . \u201d\nCharlie Rose lost his gigs at CBS This Morning , 60 Minutes , and his eponymous PBS show in November , after eight women reported that he made unwanted sexual advances toward them . One woman said that he invited her to his house , saying he was considering her for a job , then appeared naked except for a bathrobe and twice tried to put his hand down her pants .\nLast week , James Oliver Cury of the Hollywood Reporter wrote that Rose had holed up for the winter at his home in Bellport , Long Island ( \u201c described as \u2018 the un-Hamptons \u2019 \u201d ) , but made time for meals with influential people like lawyer David Boies , who has represented Harvey Weinstein . While one friend said Rose was \u201c focusing on trying to understand , [ both ] events and other people \u2019 s perception of them , \u201d another told Cury , \u201c I don \u2019 t think he thinks he \u2019 s done anything wrong \u201d and \u201c he thinks he will be back on television . \u201d\nWorkplaces are responding \u2014 but the work is far from done\nWhile powerful men mull their next steps , the workplaces that dismissed them are making changes to varying degrees . CBS News , where Rose hosted CBS This Morning and was a correspondent on 60 Minutes , has instituted mandatory in-person sexual harassment training since he was let go , according to a spokesperson for the network . The two-hour trainings supplement the company \u2019 s online training , the only format required in the past .\nThe network has also established a working group to evaluate the workplace environment at CBS more generally and make recommendations to management , according to an internal memo sent last week . The working group is holding meetings for employees to discuss their concerns , and will offer an email address to share concerns anonymously .\nIn April , Page Six reported that an upcoming expos\u00e9 about Rose in the Washington Post had CBS executives \u201c panicking that they \u2019 ll be accused of turning a blind eye to his sexual misconduct. \u201d One source told Page Six that executives had been warning employees that their nondisclosure agreements would be enforced if they talked to the Post . The spokesperson for CBS declined to comment on the Page Six report .\nMeanwhile , Mette McLoughlin , senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Minnesota Public Radio , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c our anti-harassment and non-discrimination policies have been in place for many years and upon a recent review , we find they are strong policies that have served the organization and our employees well. \u201d The review took place more than a year ago , before Keillor \u2019 s termination , according to a spokesperson .\nIn the past six months , the station has made an effort to ensure employees are aware of the anti-harassment policies and \u201c where they should bring any concerns , \u201d McLoughlin said . After the Weinstein news broke , the station hosted a series of brown-bag sessions on the policies , which gave rise to \u201c a subgroup that is working to identify how we want to define a respectful , harassment-free environment and what that requires of all of us . \u201d\nAt Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group , which manages the restaurants opened by Batali and his business partner Joe Bastianich , changes have been underway since December , when a letter to staff promised enhancements to human resources , a new anti-harassment policy , and new roles for high-profile women in the organization . Since then , the company has started an employee hotline for reporting harassment and conducted training for managers on the hotline \u2019 s use , according to David Gruber , B & B \u2019 s director of marketing .\nThe company has also hired a director of employee relations and is working with outside HR consultants , as well as distributing a company-wide survey , to better understand employee concerns , Gruber said . Meanwhile , chef Nancy Silverton and Lidia Bastianich , Joe Bastianich \u2019 s mother and a partner in many B & B restaurants , have assumed larger roles at the company . \u201c Whereas historically Lidia Bastianich and Nancy Silverton have worked only with the restaurants of which they are owners , they are now working with the kitchen leadership of all 24 restaurants in the B & B portfolio , \u201d Gruber said .\nNBC News , where Lauer worked for more than 20 years , has not yet responded to a request for comment .\nOverall , anti-harassment advocates say that while some companies are making moves , much more change is necessary to tackle the systemic problems # MeToo helped expose . \u201c We \u2019 re barely scratching the surface , and we need to do so much more , \u201d said Tammy Cho , co-founder of BetterBrave , a nonprofit that offers resources and information to employees about responding to harassment . Since BetterBrave was founded in July 2017 , she said , 85 percent of people who have reached out to the group have said they experienced some form of retaliation from their employer for reporting harassment .\n\u201c Companies have essentially forgotten the human aspect of human resources , \u201d Cho said . \u201c They too often see these individuals who report incidents of sexual harassment as legal liabilities , and they basically throw their legal team at the issue instead of trying to think about how to best resolve the situation . \u201d\nWhile it \u2019 s encouraging that companies are undertaking reforms , not all of them are particularly effective . Research has cast doubt on the effectiveness of sexual harassment training , for instance , though some evidence suggests that such training may have an impact when directed at managers , according to Frank Dobbin , a sociologist at Harvard who studies workplace diversity .\nAnti-harassment training tends to be legalistic , said Debbie Dougherty , a professor of communication at the University of Missouri who has studied sexual harassment policies , and \u201c the legal system is backward-looking \u2014 it \u2019 s based on precedent , things that have happened. \u201d Companies need to protect themselves legally , she said , but to really fix the problem of harassment , training \u201c needs to be forward-looking , based on what we need in order to change . \u201d\nDougherty also recommended that organizations institute bystander intervention training . \u201c With sexual harassment , people who do the behavior know they \u2019 re doing it \u201d \u2014 but others may need help spotting it and reacting appropriately .\nGender balance is also crucial \u2014 the presence of women at every level in a company hierarchy can help protect female employees from harassment , Dobbin says . But just promoting women into leadership roles may not be enough if they have the same mindset as the men who preceded them . \u201c There are these really deeply entrenched cultural value systems around hierarchy in the workplace , around not complaining , around being a team player and not taking things too seriously , \u201d Alemzadeh said . \u201c Whoever a manager or a leader is in an organization , if that \u2019 s their attitude , people aren \u2019 t going to feel comfortable coming forward and reporting . \u201d\nMany companies talk about preventing harassment by strengthening their anti-harassment policies , Alemzadeh added . However , many organizations with sexual harassment problems actually had strong policies in writing . \u201c The problem was there was a culture in those companies that really prevented people from feeling like those were meaningful protections . \u201d\nOne of the lessons of # MeToo has been the degree to which powerful harassers benefit from and even depend on others around them who actively or passively enable their behavior . Organizations with longstanding or widespread sexual harassment problems tend to have what Dougherty calls \u201c support staff , \u201d or \u201c unofficial people who provide support for the predator , \u201d she said .\nTo fix that problem , employers who have dismissed powerful people for harassment need to ask not just what happened but \u201c how did he get away with it \u201d \u2014 \u201c what are the processes in place that allowed this individual to get away with this behavior for so long ? \u201d\nSome of the recent crop of comeback stories have mentioned powerful men \u2019 s efforts at self-examination , reckoning with their pasts and contemplating their futures . Dougherty , meanwhile , calls for that kind of introspection on the part of companies and organizations , from Michigan State University to NPR , where high-profile people have been dismissed after reports of sexual misconduct . She \u2019 d like to see those employers \u201c asking themselves , \u2018 What did we do to support this person \u2019 s behavior , \u2019 \u201d she said , \u201c which is a soul-searching at the cultural and institutional level that I don \u2019 t think these organizations have really engaged in . \u201d",
