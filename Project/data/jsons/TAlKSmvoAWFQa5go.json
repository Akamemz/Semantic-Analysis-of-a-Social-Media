    "content": "It \u2019 s not hard to think of a historical precedent for President Donald Trump \u2019 s attempts to trade military assistance to the Ukrainian government for actionable dirt on his chief political rival . The pathetic desperation of the crime itself , the bungling attempt at a cover-up , the incriminating transcript\u2014 \u201c it really is stupid Watergate , \u201d one Democrat told the Washington Post in September . The similarities to the scandal that forced Richard Nixon from office in 1974 extend to the people talking about it . An attorney on Nixon \u2019 s House impeachment committee , Bill Weld , is running for president . John Dean , Nixon \u2019 s White House counsel , and Carl Bernstein , who helped break the scandal , are CNN contributors . A Nixon dirty trickster , Roger Stone , recently went on trial for doing more of the same for Trump . And of course there \u2019 s Trump himself , channeling Nixon \u2019 s appeals to the \u201c silent majority \u201d and \u201c law and order , \u201d and pillorying the \u201c enemy \u201d press . There \u2019 s even an attempt to cover up a break-in at the Democratic National Committee\u2014read the partial transcript of Trump \u2019 s call with the Ukrainians and you \u2019 ll find the president floating a cheese-brained conspiracy theory absolving Russia of its 2016 hacking of the DNC .\nBut coverage of the Trump fiasco is focus\u00ading on the wrong impeachment . The best parallel to Trump isn \u2019 t Nixon ; it \u2019 s Andrew Johnson , a belligerent and destructive faux-populist who escaped conviction in the Senate by the thinnest of margins . Yet for more than a century , the official narrative of the first presidential impeachment has been butchered and distorted , reduced to a historical curiosity , a showdown between two irresponsible factions in which voices of reason ultimately triumphed . You were likely taught ( if you were taught at all ) that the 1868 fight to remove Johnson from office centered on an obscure and dubious law , the Tenure of Office Act , and that \u201c Radical \u201d Republicans\u2014their influence inflated in the aftermath of the Civil War\u2014overstepped their bounds in a quest for even more power .\nThis viewpoint was memorialized most famously in John F. Kennedy \u2019 s Pulitzer-winning 1956 book , Profiles in Courage , which canonized Edmund G. Ross , the Kansas Republican senator whose last-minute reversal led to Johnson \u2019 s acquittal in his Senate trial . The verdict , as recounted by Kennedy , was a triumph of sobriety and institutional scruple , of country over party , of pragmatism over ideology . It \u2019 s all the stories official Washington loves to tell about itself , wrapped into one : When both sides are to blame , real heroism can mean doing nothing .\nThough popular critics like Kennedy have long framed the case against Johnson as a fight over something small\u2014an act of legalistic nitpicking\u2014the stakes could not have been bigger , and they should feel familiar in the Trump era . The Johnson impeachment was about what kinds of transgressions and values were worth fighting over in a country that in many ways was still at war with itself . No narrow indict\u00adment could capture the true nature of his offenses . Sometimes the biggest crimes aren \u2019 t criminal at all .\nThe Johnson impeachment was fundamentally about values and power , and about what kind of country would emerge out of its greatest conflict .\nAndrew Johnson was a sort of anti-\u00adLincoln\u2014a stumpy , vengeful , subliterate tailor who rose through the ranks of the Democratic Party in East Tennessee by railing against elites . In 1861 , he was the only Southern senator to stay loyal to the Union , leaving him not only without a state but largely without a party . Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee , and later , hoping to shore up his support ahead of his reelection campaign , added Johnson to the ticket . Johnson showed up drunk to his own swearing-in , then hid out at a friend \u2019 s house in Maryland , ashamed to show his face . A few weeks later , Lincoln was murdered and Johnson was president . As the historian Brenda Wineapple explains in her lively 2019 book , The Impeachers : The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation , the road to impeachment began in the violence and political turmoil that followed the assassination , as Johnson wrestled with Republicans in Congress about what postwar Reconstruction should look like . The impeachment process was rife with bumbling and paranoia , but nonetheless centered on a profound question : whether the nation would continue on its path toward a pluralistic democracy or revert to the white supremacist state that had existed before Fort Sumter .\nAlarm bells began to sound early on . Johnson was erratic . He was wavering . Frederick Douglass met with him at the White House and came away disturbed . In the meeting , the president had suggested deporting millions of freedmen and appeared not to know that Douglass had been enslaved . Johnson granted mass amnesties to Confederate soldiers and appointed ex-Confederates to key posts . In the spring and summer of 1866 , a wave of racial pogroms broke out in the cities of the former Confederacy , targeting African Americans\u201434 killed in New Orleans ; 46 killed in Memphis . Why hadn \u2019 t Johnson done anything to stop it ? Why was he suddenly blocking every effort by Congress to bring white supremacist violence in the South under control ? People who had once seemed enthusiastic about the project ahead were beginning to talk about the I-word .\nWineapple quotes Wendell Phillips , the Massachusetts antislavery activist , speaking after Johnson \u2019 s appointment of an ex-\u00adsecessionist governor in Raleigh : \u201c Better , far better , would it have been for Grant to have surrendered to Lee than for Johnson to have surrendered to North Carolina . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a lot about the Johnson impeachment that should feel familiar , because , as with Trump , undergirding the whole enterprise was an act of betrayal : The president \u2019 s loudest critics believed he had sold out the country and its democratic institutions to a hostile power . After four years of fighting , some 750,000 deaths , and billions in unpaid debts , Johnson was restoring to power the enemy that had just been defeated . High-ranking Confederates were creeping back into positions of influence . Enemy agents\u2014the Ku Klux Klan and its ilk , not Russian hackers\u2014brazenly attacked the foundations of a free republic and terrorized freedmen while the president and his supporters downplayed their existence and enabled their work .\nThen , as now , it was easy to fall down a rabbit hole . Just as some Trump critics went searching for the mythical Moscow \u201c pee tape , \u201d members of Congress spent months searching for evidence that would implicate Johnson in Lincoln \u2019 s death . Rep. James Ashley ( R-Ohio ) , a floor manager for the 13th Amendment , tried to dig up nonexistent correspondence between Johnson and John Wilkes Booth . Rep. Benjamin Butler ( R-Mass . ) , a crooked walrus of a man who would later serve as impeachment manager , wonder\u00aded if the 18 pages missing from Booth \u2019 s diary might have implicated the president . Politicos speculated about Johnson \u2019 s drinking and whether he was frequenting prostitutes . His behavior was so bizarre to them , there had to be some explanation .\nAnd there really was some weird shit going on . Take the case of John Surratt . Although most of the Lincoln conspirators were quickly captured , convicted , and exe\u00adcuted by military tribunals , Surratt somehow escaped to Canada and then to Rome , where he changed his name and joined the Papal Guard\u2014yes , that Papal Guard . He wore a fez with a pompom and big poofy pants and carried a musket , and when an American traveling abroad ran into him , Surratt fled to Egypt . He evaded capture for a year , long enough somehow to run out the statute of limitations on kidnapping the president\u2014the conspirators \u2019 original plan , before they switched to murder . By then the military tribunals had been disbanded . Surratt got a friendly jury in Confederate-\u00adcurious Maryland and by 1868 was a free man .\nStrange , yes . Infuriating , very . But hardly , as Rep. George Boutwell ( R-Mass . ) suggested , evidence of a sinister plot by the president . After all , the Lincoln conspirators would have assassinated Johnson too , if the man tasked with doing it hadn \u2019 t thrown away his knife and gotten drunk . There \u2019 s an Andrew Johnson in every group .\nAll of this chimes with our current conspiratorial moment . Unable to square what is happening with their understanding of how things are supposed to work , people start looking for totalizing explanations . They come to believe that the absence of smoke means someone must be covering up a fire , and that is never a good path to go down . That \u2019 s how otherwise well-\u00adbalanced people wind up getting political news from Tom Arnold .\nBut there was only one true Johnson scandal , just as there is only one true Trump scandal , and though the particulars are very different\u2014the former \u2019 s class resentment was the inverse of the latter \u2019 s class entitlement\u2014they share a common element : an open hostility to democratic ideals . That was Andrew Johnson \u2019 s high crime , and there was nothing conspiratorial or nitpicky about it . He was doing it in plain sight . The rest was noise .\nJohnson did not react well to all this talk about his loyalties . In 1866 , he decided to go on the offensive , embarking on a national tour to bolster his support . It was called the Swing Around the Circle , and it was insane . It \u2019 s tough to find a true analogue . The closest I can come to describing it is , maybe , what if George Wallace spoke at Altamont ? Presidents just don \u2019 t really talk like Johnson did on that tour , no matter what lurks in their hearts . Even Nixon didn \u2019 t talk like that , and Nixon hired a Jew-counter .\nThere are echoes of the Johnsonian aesthetic , though , in Trump . Suggesting that political opponents should go back to their countries has a Johnsonlike ring to it . Holding rallies where the crowds chant \u201c send her back \u201d is a bit more like it . Casual cracks about political violence and treason , menacing libels of vulnerable classes , endless chatter about \u201c lies \u201d and \u201c enemies , \u201d a persecution complex big enough you could send the 13th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry through it\u2014that was the essence of the Swing Around the Circle .\nHere , via Wineapple , is Andrew Johnson in St. Louis\u2014the only thing missing is a MAGA hat :\n\u201c I have been traduced and abused , \u201d he shot back , his voice tremulous with self-pity . \u201c I have been traduced , I have been slandered , I have been called Judas Iscariot , \u201d he shouted . And just because he exercised his veto power over the Freedmen \u2019 s Bureau Bill or Civil Rights , his enemies said he ought to be impeached . The sympathetic members of the crowd cried out , \u201c Never. \u201d \u201c Yes , yes ! \u201d he answered , and then speaking of himself in the third person , cried , \u201c They are ready to impeach him. \u201d \u201c Let them try it , \u201d his supporters answered back . But he was incoherent . \u201c There was a Judas once , \u201d Johnson babbled , \u201c one of the twelve apostles . Oh , yes ! And these apostles had a Christ , and he could not have had a Judas unless he had twelve apostles . \u201c If I have played the Judas , who has been my Christ that I have played Judas with ? \u201d It was bewildering . Again , he yelled , \u201c Why don \u2019 t you hang Thad Stevens and Wendell Phillips ? \u201d\nJohnson \u2019 s message , though , was disturbingly lucid : He was the only man standing between you and the mob , and you all know who the mob is . He said that Phillips and Rep. Thaddeus Stevens ( R-Pa. ) should be executed because they were ready to turn the country over to the black man while putting the white man in chains . In St. Louis , he said the people massacred in New Orleans were the real traitors , that the white people who did it were merely protecting themselves from the coming race war , and that the \u201c Radical Congress \u201d would \u201c disenfranchise white men. \u201d He was saying , with his words and actions , that the tragedy of New Orleans and Memphis was that freedmen had tried to exercise power in the first place . These were the stakes .\nIt would take two more years before enough Republicans came around to the idea of impeachment . For one thing , because the process was untested at the presidential level , no one really agreed on what constituted an impeachable offense . The Constitution said \u201c high crimes \u201d and \u201c misdemeanors. \u201d Okay\u2014what are those ? The handful of previous nonpresidential cases didn \u2019 t offer much help . One federal judge had been convicted of joining the Confederacy ; another had been acquitted of , in Wineapple \u2019 s phrasing , \u201c using rude language . \u201d\nCongress is an institution that craves structure . These are the people who practically invented the subcommittee . Stevens , a brilliant parliamentarian and Congress \u2019 most ardent advocate for racial equality , cut through all of the agonizing with a simple answer : An impeachable offense is whatever the hell a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate want it to be . \u201c I do not hold that it is necessary to prove a crime as an indictable offense , or any act malum in se , \u201d he said . In fact , Democrats who lamented that impeachment was being used as a political process were correct . It was ! \u201c I agree with the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania , on the other side of the House , who holds this to be a purely political proceeding . It is intended as a remedy for malfeasance in office and to prevent continuance thereof . \u201d\nBut Stevens \u2019 colleagues wanted a smoking gun , a clear legal infraction to hang their case on . Things continued to get worse as they twiddled their thumbs .\nWhat eventually pushed Congress over the line was Johnson \u2019 s violation of a weird law called the Tenure of Office Act , which had been passed , over presidential veto , in early 1867 and prohibited the president from firing Cabinet members without the Senate \u2019 s permission . The law is a little arcane and was later found unconstitutional , but it responded to a real crisis . Johnson \u2019 s secretary of war , Edwin Stanton , had been appointed by Lincoln . Stanton was responsible for tens of thousands of soldiers throughout the occupied South and was the last line of defense for millions of freedmen trying to exercise their rights in the face of rising white supremacist terror . Johnson wanted to get Stanton out of the way . This wasn \u2019 t really about checks and balances ; it was a break-the-glass moment for Reconstruction .\nThe president abided by the law at first , and then changed his mind and suspended Stanton six months later , firing him soon after . His replacement was Lorenzo Thomas , a drunk desk jockey ( Johnson had a type ) whose main qualification seemed to be his lack of any . After he accepted the job , as Wineapple tells it , Thomas very meekly approached Stanton to tell him that he\u2014Thomas\u2014was in charge , then attended a masquerade ball , got hammered , and was found the next morning wandering the streets of Washington telling pedestrians that he intended to raise an army to drive Stanton from his office .\nStanton moved his belongings into the War Department , barricaded the doors , and refused to leave the building . This wasn \u2019 t normal . Johnson had already said his critics should be hanged . He had stated he would not sic the Army on Congress\u2014which is the kind of thing you only really say if you \u2019 ve thought about it . Now some neighborhood drunk was going to take over the War Department . The House finally had its actionable offense . In 1868 , three years after Johnson took office , the chamber voted to impeach .\nStevens , Boutwell , and their allies were up against more than just an unhinged president with a drinking problem . They also had to deal with nervousness and dissent within their own ranks . Although Repub\u00adlicans were mostly united in their anti\u00adpathy to Johnson , they broke down into disparate factions on impeachment . There were the diehards , of course , and the outright opponents , but the rest were subject to the whims of the moment\u2014people who believed that , yes , the president was bad , but they should convict him at the ballot box , or people who gave lip service to the cause but whose true passion was fiscal responsibility . ( Because Johnson had no vice president , his removal would have placed the Senate president pro tempore , Ben Wade , in the Oval Office\u2014a nightmare scenario for hard-money bankers . )\nIn other words , they had to confront the Washington process scolds . Today , the most ardent supporters of impeachment on the left are plenty familiar with the type\u2014these are the people obsessed with the means of governance rather than its ends . In the minds of process scolds , the only thing worse than the problems is the act of doing something about them . They are duly concerned about possible threats to pluralism , but tut-tut about the discourse when a Muslim congresswoman says she wants to \u201c impeach the mother\u00adfucker \u201d who called for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States . Their response to investigations always involves more investigations . These are the people who invented the subcommittee .\nFor impeachers of any era , the process scolds are the most vexing opponents , because on a fundamental level they disagree about what impeachment should be for . Is this about a specific violation of the law ? Does it require a narrow , targeted investigation ? Or is it about everything ?\nThe impulse to make impeachment about something narrow and specific is what led Congress to devote the first eight articles of the Johnson impeachment to the Tenure of Office Act . But there was more to it than that . The ninth article focuses on charges that Johnson had circumvented the chain of command to give direct orders to a general . ( No small deal in 1868 . ) The next two articles are the ones that no one talks about\u2014in its coverage of the Clinton impeachment , cnn dismissed Article 10 as a \u201c historical curiosity \u201d \u2014but they get to the root of the matter . That \u2019 s because Stevens , the beating heart of Radical Republicanism , co-wrote them .\nEach is a sort of omnibus provision . Article 10 indicts Johnson for his behavior on the Swing Around the Circle tour\u2014not just for his death threats against members of Congress and other critics , not just for a long , rambling aside about being Jesus , but also for his role in enabling white suprem\u00adacist violence . It quotes extensively from his speeches . Article 11 focuses on his denigration of Congress and his overall pattern of obstruction . These two articles were the subtext of everything else ; Johnson \u2019 s antip\u00adathy toward Reconstruction was the reason there was a Tenure of Office Act . The president was a white nationalist who was nullifying a war .\nYou already know how it ends , of course . The Senate trial lasted more than two months . There were tactical errors by the impeachment managers , and a whole lot of what people these days would call gaslighting . At one point , one of Johnson \u2019 s personal attorneys pooh-poohed the notion that a new masked group was terrorizing the South ; within three years , Johnson \u2019 s attorney general would be working as a lawyer for the Ku Klux Klan . Opponents of Reconstruction had to lie about what was happening in the South because they , too , knew that this impeachment fight wasn \u2019 t just about Cabinet appointments . After a characteristically strange trial presided over by a chief justice with presidential ambitions of his own , Johnson was acquitted by one vote\u2014our friend Edmund Ross , of Kansas .\nDecades after Profiles was published , Ross continues to haunt Washington as a sort of patron saint of forbearance whose name is invoked whenever a constitutional crisis is in the offing . As the Watergate scandal came to a head in 1974 , Kansas Sen. Bob Dole told reporters he had started reading up on Ross . \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t mind losing my seat if the man is innocent and I voted to clear him , \u201d he said .\nIn 1999 , in the midst of the Clinton impeachment , a New York Times political reporter heralded Ross as the name that comes up \u201c whenever people talk about courage , honor and duty. \u201d Ross was \u201c a man who lived to see himself vindicated by history \u201d and \u201c chose personal ruin rather than betray his principles , \u201d the author wrote , casting Johnson as a victim of partisan overreach . His impeachers \u201c wanted to punish the defeated Confederate states rather than continue Abraham Lincoln \u2019 s policy of reconciliation , as Johnson did . \u201d\nJohnson\u2014and Ross\u2014benefited from a myth that took hold in the century that followed their impeachment drama . Successive generations of historians flipped the script on Reconstruction , framing white Southerners as victims of a tyrannical Northern regime . Reconstruction governments were painted as hopelessly corrupt , and Radical Republicans\u2014such as Stevens\u2014were on a power trip . The Lost Causers had joined up with the process scolds .\nBy the time Clinton went on trial in the Senate , a more reasoned consensus had emerged among historians , but the political press continued to portray Johnson as a victim . It got to be too much for Columbia University professor Eric Foner , the nation \u2019 s foremost Reconstruction scholar , who lashed out at the coverage in 1999 . \u201c It \u2019 s unbelievable how ignorant of American history they are , \u201d he said . \u201c They got in their mind the idea that , well , Clinton \u2019 s a good guy who a bunch of fanatics in Congress were trying to get rid of , so that \u2019 s what happened to Andrew Johnson , and a good analogy . It was appalling . \u201d\nAt least part of the myth is true : After casting his vote against conviction , Ross was vilified by members of his party , and he did lose his Senate seat . But it wasn \u2019 t a terribly long exile\u2014he was appointed governor of the New Mexico Territory in 1885 , and eventually many of his onetime critics were ready to move on . James G. Blaine , a Maine Republican who had voted to impeach , later argued that conviction \u201c would have resulted in greater injury to free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was able to inflict. \u201d Ross \u2019 rehabilitation coincided with a shift in his own party . White Republicans steadily lost enthusiasm for Reconstruction in the decade after impeachment , and Jim Crow took hold across the South .\nBut JFK\u2014or his ghostwriter , Ted Sorensen\u2014\u00adleft out some important details about the courageous Ross . For one thing , his vote wasn \u2019 t as critical as it \u2019 s been portrayed ; Johnson \u2019 s defenders had more poten\u00adtial \u201c no \u201d votes in their pocket that they didn \u2019 t end up using . More importantly , he was probably bribed to vote that way ! Or at least the people doing the bribing seemed to think so . There was a lot of shadowy stuff happening in the runup to the vote , and Ross already owed his job to some fairly brazen horse-trading back in Kansas . When the president \u2019 s acquittal was complete , Ross quickly returned to Johnson with a laundry list of favors , including patronage jobs for his personal associates as Indian agents , and ratification of a treaty giving away Osage lands to a railroad company . Sabotaging efforts at protecting the civil rights of Black Americans in order to profit off American Indians really does take some of the shine off the halo .\nIt \u2019 s all the more striking because the people Kennedy takes to task in these chapters are , in many cases , his most distinguished Massachusetts predecessors . Butler , the impeachment manager , is repeatedly referred to as \u201c the butcher of New Orleans , \u201d presumably because a resident of the city was executed for treason on his watch in 1862 ; the actual massacre of Black residents of New Orleans that precipitated the impeachment is never mentioned . Kennedy takes aim at Sen. Charles Sumner ( who at the time of the Johnson impeachment still bore the scars of a brutal beating at the hands of a South Carolinian colleague ) ; Wendell Phillips , of the American Anti-Slavery Society ; and George Boutwell , an abolitionist whose congressional seat Kennedy would one day hold .\nKennedy and Sorensen show their hand when they savage Adelbert Ames , another Northern Republican , who moved to Mississippi in the 1860s to serve as governor :\nNo state suffered more from carpet\u00adbag rule than Mississippi . He was chosen Governor by a majority composed of freed slaves and Radical Republicans , sustained and nourished by Federal bayonets . One Cardoza , under indictment for larceny in New York , was placed at the head of public schools and two former slaves held the offices of Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State . Vast areas of northern Mississippi lay in ruins . Taxes increased to a level fourteen times as high as normal in order to support the extravagances of the reconstruction government and heavy state and national war debts .\nReconstruction , they wrote , was \u201c a black nightmare the South could never forget . \u201d\nYou can tell a lot about people by the lines they choose to draw . For Ross \u2019 defenders , the line wasn \u2019 t the creation of a white supremacist state through terrorism ; it was the use of a constitutional mechanism to remove the president responsible for creating such a state . Blaine , with his elegy on the \u201c greater injury , \u201d said it pretty much directly . This is the eternal lie of comity and decorum , the cowardice of compromise , though the stakes have almost never been as high as they were then , not even now .\nThe Johnson impeachment got bogged down in a morass of legal procedure and political calculations . It was suffused with paranoia and sometimes slapstick , but it was fundamentally about values and power , and about what kind of country would emerge out of its greatest conflict . Plenty of people\u2014 \u201c people of their time , \u201d as the apologia goes\u2014understood that bloodshed was the price of inaction , that there was nothing courageous about meek deference to power .\nThe real tragedy of the trial wasn \u2019 t poor , pathetic Edmund Ross losing his seat . When the vote fails , Wineapple takes us to places that Kennedy never ventured in his book\u2014churches in Charleston and Memphis where African Americans mourned what they knew they \u2019 d lost , steeling themselves for the fight to come . They knew what the impeachment was really about , and they knew who had won . As Foner put it , \u201c Andrew Johnson was impeached over violating a fairly minor act of Congress , whereas his real crime was trying to deprive 4 million American citizens of all their rights . \u201d\nWineapple is too serious and disciplined a historian to say exactly what we should think about all this . The pieces are there , though , and it \u2019 s not my book , so here goes : At least they impeached the motherfucker .\nThis article was featured in \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s January/February 2020 print issue , and has been updated to reflect research and editorial changes .",
    "content_original": "It\u2019s not hard to think of a historical precedent for President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to trade military assistance to the Ukrainian government for actionable dirt on his chief political rival. The pathetic desperation of the crime itself, the bungling attempt at a cover-up, the incriminating transcript\u2014\u201cit really is stupid Watergate,\u201d one Democrat told the Washington Post in September. The similarities to the scandal that forced Richard Nixon from office in 1974 extend to the people talking about it. An attorney on Nixon\u2019s House impeachment committee, Bill Weld, is running for president. John Dean, Nixon\u2019s White House counsel, and Carl Bernstein, who helped break the scandal, are CNN contributors. A Nixon dirty trickster, Roger Stone, recently went on trial for doing more of the same for Trump. And of course there\u2019s Trump himself, channeling Nixon\u2019s appeals to the \u201csilent majority\u201d and \u201claw and order,\u201d and pillorying the \u201cenemy\u201d press. There\u2019s even an attempt to cover up a break-in at the Democratic National Committee\u2014read the partial transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainians and you\u2019ll find the president floating a cheese-brained conspiracy theory absolving Russia of its 2016 hacking of the DNC.\n\nBut coverage of the Trump fiasco is focus\u00ading on the wrong impeachment. The best parallel to Trump isn\u2019t Nixon; it\u2019s Andrew Johnson, a belligerent and destructive faux-populist who escaped conviction in the Senate by the thinnest of margins. Yet for more than a century, the official narrative of the first presidential impeachment has been butchered and distorted, reduced to a historical curiosity, a showdown between two irresponsible factions in which voices of reason ultimately triumphed. You were likely taught (if you were taught at all) that the 1868 fight to remove Johnson from office centered on an obscure and dubious law, the Tenure of Office Act, and that \u201cRadical\u201d Republicans\u2014their influence inflated in the aftermath of the Civil War\u2014overstepped their bounds in a quest for even more power.\n\nThis viewpoint was memorialized most famously in John F. Kennedy\u2019s Pulitzer-winning 1956 book, Profiles in Courage, which canonized Edmund G. Ross, the Kansas Republican senator whose last-minute reversal led to Johnson\u2019s acquittal in his Senate trial. The verdict, as recounted by Kennedy, was a triumph of sobriety and institutional scruple, of country over party, of pragmatism over ideology. It\u2019s all the stories official Washington loves to tell about itself, wrapped into one: When both sides are to blame, real heroism can mean doing nothing.\n\nThough popular critics like Kennedy have long framed the case against Johnson as a fight over something small\u2014an act of legalistic nitpicking\u2014the stakes could not have been bigger, and they should feel familiar in the Trump era. The Johnson impeachment was about what kinds of transgressions and values were worth fighting over in a country that in many ways was still at war with itself. No narrow indict\u00adment could capture the true nature of his offenses. Sometimes the biggest crimes aren\u2019t criminal at all.\n\nThe Johnson impeachment was fundamentally about values and power, and about what kind of country would emerge out of its greatest conflict.\n\nAndrew Johnson was a sort of anti-\u00adLincoln\u2014a stumpy, vengeful, subliterate tailor who rose through the ranks of the Democratic Party in East Tennessee by railing against elites. In 1861, he was the only Southern senator to stay loyal to the Union, leaving him not only without a state but largely without a party. Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee, and later, hoping to shore up his support ahead of his reelection campaign, added Johnson to the ticket. Johnson showed up drunk to his own swearing-in, then hid out at a friend\u2019s house in Maryland, ashamed to show his face. A few weeks later, Lincoln was murdered and Johnson was president. As the historian Brenda Wineapple explains in her lively 2019 book, The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation, the road to impeachment began in the violence and political turmoil that followed the assassination, as Johnson wrestled with Republicans in Congress about what postwar Reconstruction should look like. The impeachment process was rife with bumbling and paranoia, but nonetheless centered on a profound question: whether the nation would continue on its path toward a pluralistic democracy or revert to the white supremacist state that had existed before Fort Sumter.\n\nAlarm bells began to sound early on. Johnson was erratic. He was wavering. Frederick Douglass met with him at the White House and came away disturbed. In the meeting, the president had suggested deporting millions of freedmen and appeared not to know that Douglass had been enslaved. Johnson granted mass amnesties to Confederate soldiers and appointed ex-Confederates to key posts. In the spring and summer of 1866, a wave of racial pogroms broke out in the cities of the former Confederacy, targeting African Americans\u201434 killed in New Orleans; 46 killed in Memphis. Why hadn\u2019t Johnson done anything to stop it? Why was he suddenly blocking every effort by Congress to bring white supremacist violence in the South under control? People who had once seemed enthusiastic about the project ahead were beginning to talk about the I-word.\n\nWineapple quotes Wendell Phillips, the Massachusetts antislavery activist, speaking after Johnson\u2019s appointment of an ex-\u00adsecessionist governor in Raleigh: \u201cBetter, far better, would it have been for Grant to have surrendered to Lee than for Johnson to have surrendered to North Carolina.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot about the Johnson impeachment that should feel familiar, because, as with Trump, undergirding the whole enterprise was an act of betrayal: The president\u2019s loudest critics believed he had sold out the country and its democratic institutions to a hostile power. After four years of fighting, some 750,000 deaths, and billions in unpaid debts, Johnson was restoring to power the enemy that had just been defeated. High-ranking Confederates were creeping back into positions of influence. Enemy agents\u2014the Ku Klux Klan and its ilk, not Russian hackers\u2014brazenly attacked the foundations of a free republic and terrorized freedmen while the president and his supporters downplayed their existence and enabled their work.\n\nThen, as now, it was easy to fall down a rabbit hole. Just as some Trump critics went searching for the mythical Moscow \u201cpee tape,\u201d members of Congress spent months searching for evidence that would implicate Johnson in Lincoln\u2019s death. Rep. James Ashley (R-Ohio), a floor manager for the 13th Amendment, tried to dig up nonexistent correspondence between Johnson and John Wilkes Booth. Rep. Benjamin Butler (R-Mass.), a crooked walrus of a man who would later serve as impeachment manager, wonder\u00aded if the 18 pages missing from Booth\u2019s diary might have implicated the president. Politicos speculated about Johnson\u2019s drinking and whether he was frequenting prostitutes. His behavior was so bizarre to them, there had to be some explanation.\n\nAnd there really was some weird shit going on. Take the case of John Surratt. Although most of the Lincoln conspirators were quickly captured, convicted, and exe\u00adcuted by military tribunals, Surratt somehow escaped to Canada and then to Rome, where he changed his name and joined the Papal Guard\u2014yes, that Papal Guard. He wore a fez with a pompom and big poofy pants and carried a musket, and when an American traveling abroad ran into him, Surratt fled to Egypt. He evaded capture for a year, long enough somehow to run out the statute of limitations on kidnapping the president\u2014the conspirators\u2019 original plan, before they switched to murder. By then the military tribunals had been disbanded. Surratt got a friendly jury in Confederate-\u00adcurious Maryland and by 1868 was a free man.\n\nStrange, yes. Infuriating, very. But hardly, as Rep. George Boutwell (R-Mass.) suggested, evidence of a sinister plot by the president. After all, the Lincoln conspirators would have assassinated Johnson too, if the man tasked with doing it hadn\u2019t thrown away his knife and gotten drunk. There\u2019s an Andrew Johnson in every group.\n\nAll of this chimes with our current conspiratorial moment. Unable to square what is happening with their understanding of how things are supposed to work, people start looking for totalizing explanations. They come to believe that the absence of smoke means someone must be covering up a fire, and that is never a good path to go down. That\u2019s how otherwise well-\u00adbalanced people wind up getting political news from Tom Arnold.\n\nBut there was only one true Johnson scandal, just as there is only one true Trump scandal, and though the particulars are very different\u2014the former\u2019s class resentment was the inverse of the latter\u2019s class entitlement\u2014they share a common element: an open hostility to democratic ideals. That was Andrew Johnson\u2019s high crime, and there was nothing conspiratorial or nitpicky about it. He was doing it in plain sight. The rest was noise.\n\nJohnson did not react well to all this talk about his loyalties. In 1866, he decided to go on the offensive, embarking on a national tour to bolster his support. It was called the Swing Around the Circle, and it was insane. It\u2019s tough to find a true analogue. The closest I can come to describing it is, maybe, what if George Wallace spoke at Altamont? Presidents just don\u2019t really talk like Johnson did on that tour, no matter what lurks in their hearts. Even Nixon didn\u2019t talk like that, and Nixon hired a Jew-counter.\n\nThere are echoes of the Johnsonian aesthetic, though, in Trump. Suggesting that political opponents should go back to their countries has a Johnsonlike ring to it. Holding rallies where the crowds chant \u201csend her back\u201d is a bit more like it. Casual cracks about political violence and treason, menacing libels of vulnerable classes, endless chatter about \u201clies\u201d and \u201cenemies,\u201d a persecution complex big enough you could send the 13th Regiment Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry through it\u2014that was the essence of the Swing Around the Circle.\n\nHere, via Wineapple, is Andrew Johnson in St. Louis\u2014the only thing missing is a MAGA hat:\n\n\u201cI have been traduced and abused,\u201d he shot back, his voice tremulous with self-pity. \u201cI have been traduced, I have been slandered, I have been called Judas Iscariot,\u201d he shouted. And just because he exercised his veto power over the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Bill or Civil Rights, his enemies said he ought to be impeached. The sympathetic members of the crowd cried out, \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cYes, yes!\u201d he answered, and then speaking of himself in the third person, cried, \u201cThey are ready to impeach him.\u201d \u201cLet them try it,\u201d his supporters answered back. But he was incoherent. \u201cThere was a Judas once,\u201d Johnson babbled, \u201cone of the twelve apostles. Oh, yes! And these apostles had a Christ, and he could not have had a Judas unless he had twelve apostles. \u201cIf I have played the Judas, who has been my Christ that I have played Judas with?\u201d It was bewildering. Again, he yelled, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hang Thad Stevens and Wendell Phillips?\u201d\n\nAnd they never show the crowd!\n\nJohnson\u2019s message, though, was disturbingly lucid: He was the only man standing between you and the mob, and you all know who the mob is. He said that Phillips and Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (R-Pa.) should be executed because they were ready to turn the country over to the black man while putting the white man in chains. In St. Louis, he said the people massacred in New Orleans were the real traitors, that the white people who did it were merely protecting themselves from the coming race war, and that the \u201cRadical Congress\u201d would \u201cdisenfranchise white men.\u201d He was saying, with his words and actions, that the tragedy of New Orleans and Memphis was that freedmen had tried to exercise power in the first place. These were the stakes.\n\nIt would take two more years before enough Republicans came around to the idea of impeachment. For one thing, because the process was untested at the presidential level, no one really agreed on what constituted an impeachable offense. The Constitution said \u201chigh crimes\u201d and \u201cmisdemeanors.\u201d Okay\u2014what are those? The handful of previous nonpresidential cases didn\u2019t offer much help. One federal judge had been convicted of joining the Confederacy; another had been acquitted of, in Wineapple\u2019s phrasing, \u201cusing rude language.\u201d\n\nCongress is an institution that craves structure. These are the people who practically invented the subcommittee. Stevens, a brilliant parliamentarian and Congress\u2019 most ardent advocate for racial equality, cut through all of the agonizing with a simple answer: An impeachable offense is whatever the hell a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate want it to be. \u201cI do not hold that it is necessary to prove a crime as an indictable offense, or any act malum in se,\u201d he said. In fact, Democrats who lamented that impeachment was being used as a political process were correct. It was! \u201cI agree with the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, on the other side of the House, who holds this to be a purely political proceeding. It is intended as a remedy for malfeasance in office and to prevent continuance thereof.\u201d\n\nBut Stevens\u2019 colleagues wanted a smoking gun, a clear legal infraction to hang their case on. Things continued to get worse as they twiddled their thumbs.\n\nWhat eventually pushed Congress over the line was Johnson\u2019s violation of a weird law called the Tenure of Office Act, which had been passed, over presidential veto, in early 1867 and prohibited the president from firing Cabinet members without the Senate\u2019s permission. The law is a little arcane and was later found unconstitutional, but it responded to a real crisis. Johnson\u2019s secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, had been appointed by Lincoln. Stanton was responsible for tens of thousands of soldiers throughout the occupied South and was the last line of defense for millions of freedmen trying to exercise their rights in the face of rising white supremacist terror. Johnson wanted to get Stanton out of the way. This wasn\u2019t really about checks and balances; it was a break-the-glass moment for Reconstruction.\n\nThe president abided by the law at first, and then changed his mind and suspended Stanton six months later, firing him soon after. His replacement was Lorenzo Thomas, a drunk desk jockey (Johnson had a type) whose main qualification seemed to be his lack of any. After he accepted the job, as Wineapple tells it, Thomas very meekly approached Stanton to tell him that he\u2014Thomas\u2014was in charge, then attended a masquerade ball, got hammered, and was found the next morning wandering the streets of Washington telling pedestrians that he intended to raise an army to drive Stanton from his office.\n\nStanton moved his belongings into the War Department, barricaded the doors, and refused to leave the building. This wasn\u2019t normal. Johnson had already said his critics should be hanged. He had stated he would not sic the Army on Congress\u2014which is the kind of thing you only really say if you\u2019ve thought about it. Now some neighborhood drunk was going to take over the War Department. The House finally had its actionable offense. In 1868, three years after Johnson took office, the chamber voted to impeach.\n\nStevens, Boutwell, and their allies were up against more than just an unhinged president with a drinking problem. They also had to deal with nervousness and dissent within their own ranks. Although Repub\u00adlicans were mostly united in their anti\u00adpathy to Johnson, they broke down into disparate factions on impeachment. There were the diehards, of course, and the outright opponents, but the rest were subject to the whims of the moment\u2014people who believed that, yes, the president was bad, but they should convict him at the ballot box, or people who gave lip service to the cause but whose true passion was fiscal responsibility. (Because Johnson had no vice president, his removal would have placed the Senate president pro tempore, Ben Wade, in the Oval Office\u2014a nightmare scenario for hard-money bankers.)\n\nIn other words, they had to confront the Washington process scolds. Today, the most ardent supporters of impeachment on the left are plenty familiar with the type\u2014these are the people obsessed with the means of governance rather than its ends. In the minds of process scolds, the only thing worse than the problems is the act of doing something about them. They are duly concerned about possible threats to pluralism, but tut-tut about the discourse when a Muslim congresswoman says she wants to \u201cimpeach the mother\u00adfucker\u201d who called for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States. Their response to investigations always involves more investigations. These are the people who invented the subcommittee.\n\nFor impeachers of any era, the process scolds are the most vexing opponents, because on a fundamental level they disagree about what impeachment should be for. Is this about a specific violation of the law? Does it require a narrow, targeted investigation? Or is it about everything?\n\nThe impulse to make impeachment about something narrow and specific is what led Congress to devote the first eight articles of the Johnson impeachment to the Tenure of Office Act. But there was more to it than that. The ninth article focuses on charges that Johnson had circumvented the chain of command to give direct orders to a general. (No small deal in 1868.) The next two articles are the ones that no one talks about\u2014in its coverage of the Clinton impeachment, cnn dismissed Article 10 as a \u201chistorical curiosity\u201d\u2014but they get to the root of the matter. That\u2019s because Stevens, the beating heart of Radical Republicanism, co-wrote them.\n\nEach is a sort of omnibus provision. Article 10 indicts Johnson for his behavior on the Swing Around the Circle tour\u2014not just for his death threats against members of Congress and other critics, not just for a long, rambling aside about being Jesus, but also for his role in enabling white suprem\u00adacist violence. It quotes extensively from his speeches. Article 11 focuses on his denigration of Congress and his overall pattern of obstruction. These two articles were the subtext of everything else; Johnson\u2019s antip\u00adathy toward Reconstruction was the reason there was a Tenure of Office Act. The president was a white nationalist who was nullifying a war.\n\nYou already know how it ends, of course. The Senate trial lasted more than two months. There were tactical errors by the impeachment managers, and a whole lot of what people these days would call gaslighting. At one point, one of Johnson\u2019s personal attorneys pooh-poohed the notion that a new masked group was terrorizing the South; within three years, Johnson\u2019s attorney general would be working as a lawyer for the Ku Klux Klan. Opponents of Reconstruction had to lie about what was happening in the South because they, too, knew that this impeachment fight wasn\u2019t just about Cabinet appointments. After a characteristically strange trial presided over by a chief justice with presidential ambitions of his own, Johnson was acquitted by one vote\u2014our friend Edmund Ross, of Kansas.\n\nDecades after Profiles was published, Ross continues to haunt Washington as a sort of patron saint of forbearance whose name is invoked whenever a constitutional crisis is in the offing. As the Watergate scandal came to a head in 1974, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole told reporters he had started reading up on Ross. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind losing my seat if the man is innocent and I voted to clear him,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 1999, in the midst of the Clinton impeachment, a New York Times political reporter heralded Ross as the name that comes up \u201cwhenever people talk about courage, honor and duty.\u201d Ross was \u201ca man who lived to see himself vindicated by history\u201d and \u201cchose personal ruin rather than betray his principles,\u201d the author wrote, casting Johnson as a victim of partisan overreach. His impeachers \u201cwanted to punish the defeated Confederate states rather than continue Abraham Lincoln\u2019s policy of reconciliation, as Johnson did.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2014and Ross\u2014benefited from a myth that took hold in the century that followed their impeachment drama. Successive generations of historians flipped the script on Reconstruction, framing white Southerners as victims of a tyrannical Northern regime. Reconstruction governments were painted as hopelessly corrupt, and Radical Republicans\u2014such as Stevens\u2014were on a power trip. The Lost Causers had joined up with the process scolds.\n\nBy the time Clinton went on trial in the Senate, a more reasoned consensus had emerged among historians, but the political press continued to portray Johnson as a victim. It got to be too much for Columbia University professor Eric Foner, the nation\u2019s foremost Reconstruction scholar, who lashed out at the coverage in 1999. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how ignorant of American history they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got in their mind the idea that, well, Clinton\u2019s a good guy who a bunch of fanatics in Congress were trying to get rid of, so that\u2019s what happened to Andrew Johnson, and a good analogy. It was appalling.\u201d\n\nAt least part of the myth is true: After casting his vote against conviction, Ross was vilified by members of his party, and he did lose his Senate seat. But it wasn\u2019t a terribly long exile\u2014he was appointed governor of the New Mexico Territory in 1885, and eventually many of his onetime critics were ready to move on. James G. Blaine, a Maine Republican who had voted to impeach, later argued that conviction \u201cwould have resulted in greater injury to free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was able to inflict.\u201d Ross\u2019 rehabilitation coincided with a shift in his own party. White Republicans steadily lost enthusiasm for Reconstruction in the decade after impeachment, and Jim Crow took hold across the South.\n\nBut JFK\u2014or his ghostwriter, Ted Sorensen\u2014\u00adleft out some important details about the courageous Ross. For one thing, his vote wasn\u2019t as critical as it\u2019s been portrayed; Johnson\u2019s defenders had more poten\u00adtial \u201cno\u201d votes in their pocket that they didn\u2019t end up using. More importantly, he was probably bribed to vote that way! Or at least the people doing the bribing seemed to think so. There was a lot of shadowy stuff happening in the runup to the vote, and Ross already owed his job to some fairly brazen horse-trading back in Kansas. When the president\u2019s acquittal was complete, Ross quickly returned to Johnson with a laundry list of favors, including patronage jobs for his personal associates as Indian agents, and ratification of a treaty giving away Osage lands to a railroad company. Sabotaging efforts at protecting the civil rights of Black Americans in order to profit off American Indians really does take some of the shine off the halo.\n\nIt\u2019s all the more striking because the people Kennedy takes to task in these chapters are, in many cases, his most distinguished Massachusetts predecessors. Butler, the impeachment manager, is repeatedly referred to as \u201cthe butcher of New Orleans,\u201d presumably because a resident of the city was executed for treason on his watch in 1862; the actual massacre of Black residents of New Orleans that precipitated the impeachment is never mentioned. Kennedy takes aim at Sen. Charles Sumner (who at the time of the Johnson impeachment still bore the scars of a brutal beating at the hands of a South Carolinian colleague); Wendell Phillips, of the American Anti-Slavery Society; and George Boutwell, an abolitionist whose congressional seat Kennedy would one day hold.\n\nKennedy and Sorensen show their hand when they savage Adelbert Ames, another Northern Republican, who moved to Mississippi in the 1860s to serve as governor:\n\nNo state suffered more from carpet\u00adbag rule than Mississippi. He was chosen Governor by a majority composed of freed slaves and Radical Republicans, sustained and nourished by Federal bayonets. One Cardoza, under indictment for larceny in New York, was placed at the head of public schools and two former slaves held the offices of Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State. Vast areas of northern Mississippi lay in ruins. Taxes increased to a level fourteen times as high as normal in order to support the extravagances of the reconstruction government and heavy state and national war debts.\n\nReconstruction, they wrote, was \u201ca black nightmare the South could never forget.\u201d\n\nYou can tell a lot about people by the lines they choose to draw. For Ross\u2019 defenders, the line wasn\u2019t the creation of a white supremacist state through terrorism; it was the use of a constitutional mechanism to remove the president responsible for creating such a state. Blaine, with his elegy on the \u201cgreater injury,\u201d said it pretty much directly. This is the eternal lie of comity and decorum, the cowardice of compromise, though the stakes have almost never been as high as they were then, not even now.\n\nThe Johnson impeachment got bogged down in a morass of legal procedure and political calculations. It was suffused with paranoia and sometimes slapstick, but it was fundamentally about values and power, and about what kind of country would emerge out of its greatest conflict. Plenty of people\u2014\u201cpeople of their time,\u201d as the apologia goes\u2014understood that bloodshed was the price of inaction, that there was nothing courageous about meek deference to power.\n\nThe real tragedy of the trial wasn\u2019t poor, pathetic Edmund Ross losing his seat. When the vote fails, Wineapple takes us to places that Kennedy never ventured in his book\u2014churches in Charleston and Memphis where African Americans mourned what they knew they\u2019d lost, steeling themselves for the fight to come. They knew what the impeachment was really about, and they knew who had won. As Foner put it, \u201cAndrew Johnson was impeached over violating a fairly minor act of Congress, whereas his real crime was trying to deprive 4 million American citizens of all their rights.\u201d\n\nWineapple is too serious and disciplined a historian to say exactly what we should think about all this. The pieces are there, though, and it\u2019s not my book, so here goes: At least they impeached the motherfucker.\n\nThis article was featured in Mother Jones\u2019s January/February 2020 print issue, and has been updated to reflect research and editorial changes.",
