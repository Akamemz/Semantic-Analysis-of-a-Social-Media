    "content": "There 's a telling moment in Laura Poitras ' Oscar-winning documentary Citizenfour . As Edward Snowden , the National Security Agency whistleblower at the center of the film , packs his bags in a Hong Kong hotel for a desperately uncertain future , the camera lingers for a beat on the book near Snowden 's ever-present laptop : Cory Doctorow 's novel Homeland .\nAs sci-fi nerds can tell you , Homeland is no random novel . The book tells the tale of a wary , civil libertarian college-dropout hacker who has in his possession a four-gigabyte file of nefarious government documents , which he seeks to release even as powerful interests stalk his every move . Sound familiar ?\nThe novelist is also no ordinary scribbler . In addition to producing Prometheus Award\u2013winning novels , Cory Doctorow is an influential copyright reform activist and co-editor of the hugely popular tech-culture group weblog BoingBoing . As the media thinker Lawrence Lessig pointed out last year , Citizenfour 's core audience of geeks recognized Homeland as one of several key `` internal references , '' along with the stickers on Snowden 's laptop from the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the online privacy tool Tor . `` If you are a public official on the wrong side of this fight , '' Lessig proclaimed , `` that core will stand against you . ''\nBut that 's not quite true . Or at least , it 's not the whole story . As I watched Citizenfour for the first time the day after the Academy Awards , the Doctorow reference felt bittersweet . That 's because the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) was on the cusp of a long-telegraphed 3\u20132 vote along party lines to place unprecedented regulatory controls onto the Internet . And one of the key lobbies supporting the FCC 's intrusion was led in part by none other than Cory Doctorow himself .\nUnder the vague banner of `` net neutrality '' \u2014once technical jargon , now a surprisingly effective political slogan\u2014federal regulators unceremoniously shoved the Internet out of the less-regulated `` information service '' category and reclassified it as a `` telecommunications service , '' thus subjecting it to oversight under the far more hands-on Title II of the Telecommunications Act . The aim , in the words of supporters such as Doctorow , is to forcibly prevent Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) such as Comcast , Time Warner Cable , and Verizon from `` extract [ ing ] ransom from everyone you want to talk to on the internet . '' That such ransom notes have stubbornly failed to materialize has been deemed immaterial .\nAs dissenting FCC commissioner Ajit Pai puts it bracingly in a must-read interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Nick Gillespie on page 44 , net neutrality is `` a solution that wo n't work to a problem that simply does n't exist . '' Instances where large ISPs have violated the principles of the `` open Internet '' are vanishingly few , and all involve disputes between corporations that were resolvable under existing laws , not circumstances where Comcast is brutally repressing a lone defenseless blogger .\nWhy did the same Netizens ( as they are no longer called ) who rally against government in the name of privacy turn around and rally in favor of it when it comes to data prioritization arrangements ? Partly because of a deep-seated and wholly understandable dislike of ISP giants . In a world where very few brands matter anymore on a visceral level ( with Apple being one of the few exceptions ) , companies like Time Warner and Comcast inspire deep hatred . My family probably called Time Warner customer service at least four dozen times in our two years as unhappy clients ; the moment we were able to escape to Verizon felt like V.J . Day . Champagne was uncorked .\nIt 's not hard to upgrade such well-deserved customer hostility from assertions of incompetence to accusations of organized thuggery . As Doctorow charged in The Guardian last year , `` The ISPs are n't seeking to get paid , they 're seeking to get paid twice : once by you , and a second time because you are now their hostage and the companies you want to do business with have to get through them to get to you . ''\nBut one problem with today 's ( and yesterday 's ) complaints about ISP giants is that they discount the more competitive developments coming tomorrow\u2014if government gets the hell out of the way . As Geoffrey A. Manne and R. Ben Sperry explain in `` How to Break the Internet '' ( page 20 ) , `` imposing public-utility regulation under Title II means the qualities you do n't like about your cable company will become more widespread . It will mean less competition , reduced investment ( especially in underserved communities ) , slower broadband for everyone , and new regulatory hurdles for startups . '' If you do n't like what the comparatively free market offered , just wait until broadband providers start feeling more like your local electric company .\nManne and Sperry argue that allowing the Internet industry to set prices on data prioritization ( or not ! ) is an excellent way to maximize the potential for experimentation and business development . We 'll all be streaming live video to and from all our devices soon enough ; somebody needs to build out the infrastructure to make that possible . And an underappreciated benefit to legalizing prices is that it allows total unknowns to buy their way onto the same radar screens as the major players . Take that ability away and incumbents will become even more entrenched .\nEven if you take as given that tolerating data-delivery prices equals allowing for `` discrimination , '' it 's still a terrible idea to task the government with preventing it . Adam Thierer , the thinker behind the concept of `` permissionless innovation , '' explains on page 30 ( `` Uncle Sam Wants Your Fitbit '' ) that the precautionary principle could prove disastrous if applied to America 's globally envied Internet culture . `` If we spend all our time worrying over worst-case scenarios , '' Thierer argues , `` that means the best-case scenarios will never come about either . ''\nAre the days of the freewheeling Internet behind us ? Of course not . To see why , look no further than the proclamations 15 years ago from the very people cheering loudest today about net neutrality .\nWhen AOL announced a merger with Time Warner in 2000 , the media activist Robert McChesney warned that unless the mega-deal was blocked on antitrust grounds , `` the eventual course of the Internet\u2014the central nervous system of our era\u2014will be determined by where the most money can be made , regardless of the social and political implications . '' Not only was the macro-prediction wildly off-base\u2014the course of the Internet has continued flowing through every which way that humans dream up , regardless of the money implications\u2014but the micro-fear was quickly rendered ridiculous as well . AOL Time Warner no longer exists ; its remaining husk sheared off Time Inc. in 2013 .\nYet McChesney and his Free Press group continued soldiering on , lobbying on behalf of net neutrality for more than a decade now . Their short-term victory is a triumph of fear over evidence , of anti-corporate animus eclipsing suspicion of the state .

To our net-neutrality-hating friends on the right , we say thank you for correctly identifying `` Internet freedom '' as a key political and moral issue for our time ; America 's online innovation has been one of the most salutary developments of the last two decades , one that everyone on every side of every political debate benefits from .
