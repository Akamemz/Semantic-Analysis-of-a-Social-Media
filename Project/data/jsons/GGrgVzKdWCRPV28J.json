    "content": "At the Libertarian Town Hall on CNN earlier this month , the Libertarian Party \u2019 s presidential candidate Gary Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld made a pitch to both \u201c Never-Hillary \u201d and \u201c Never-Trump \u201d voters on the left and right of the political spectrum as the sane and principled third-party alternative for 2016 . And whether you agree or disagree with what the two former governors had to say , it \u2019 s hard to deny their likability \u2014 especially in an election where the two major party candidates are as thoroughly unlikable as Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton .\nJohnson and Weld presumably have a better shot at appealing to Never-Trump conservatives than Never-Hillary liberals or leftists ( whose political views align much more with the Green Party \u2019 s Jill Stein ) , but the former New Mexico governor did make a compelling pitch \u2014 superficially , at least \u2014 to disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters at the Town Hall . And while polls indicate that the majority of the democratic socialist \u2019 s supporters will vote for Clinton in November , there is a minority faction that will be voting their conscience \u2014 and Johnson is certainly in a position to woo some of these voters .\nWith this undoubtedly in the back of his mind , the libertarian candidate said that he and Bernie are similar \u201c on about 75 percent of what \u2019 s out there , \u201d from marriage equality and reproductive rights , to the legalization of marijuana and the end of futile military interventions overseas . From an \u201c economic standpoint , \u201d however , Johnson admitted disagreement :\n\u201c If Bernie supporters are really looking for income equality , I don \u2019 t think that is something that government can accomplish . Taking from Peter to rob Paul , that \u2019 s an equation that Peter really loves . But if Bernie supporters are looking for equal opportunity , I think that is something that can be accomplished . \u2026 In politics , you can definitely stand up for equal opportunity . \u201d\nIt was a cogent response that included an acknowledgement that \u201c crony capitalism is alive and well \u201d \u2014 something that libertarians and leftists have long agreed on ( and equally object to ) . But apart from this , Johnson \u2019 s economic worldview is diametrically opposed to Sanders \u2019 egalitarian vision of social democracy \u2014 and this should be enough to stop the latter 's supporters from voting for the former .\nIn the economic realm , right-wing libertarians ( as opposed to left libertarians or \u201c libertarian socialists \u201d ) are essentially classical economic liberals who reject most of the social democratic reforms that were enacted throughout the capitalist world during the 20th century . Instead of a mixed economy , libertarians advocate laissez faire capitalism and profess that even minimal state intervention in the economy will lead to tyranny \u2014 or serfdom , as the famous libertarian philosopher F. A. Hayek put it in his influential book `` The Road to Serfdom '' ( this didn \u2019 t pan out , of course \u2014 instead , it was the welfare state that likely prevented more radical assaults on capitalism in the West ) .\nIn his statement , Johnson said that he doesn \u2019 t believe that the government can reduce economic inequality \u2014 which has soared over the past forty years \u2014 and equated redistributive measures to theft . This alone reveals the candidates dogmatic worldview . The social democratic reforms of the 20th century clearly demonstrate that wealth and income inequality can be curbed within a capitalist economy ( and should be if leaders want to achieve greater economic and political stability ) . While Johnson is less fanatical than some of his party colleagues ( indeed , he is considered too moderate by many libertarians ) , he is still undoubtedly the most extreme candidate of 2016 on economic matters . He opposes corporate taxation , supports privatized healthcare , advocates eliminating the progressive income tax and replacing them with a regressive consumption tax , and is a proponent of widespread economic deregulation and privatization ( including the privatization of prisons ) .\nLibertarianism may sound good on paper \u2014 championing individualism and maximum freedom ; but in practice , its laissez faire prescriptions would result in corporate tyranny , the very opposite of freedom ( libertarians are so consumed with the threat of state tyranny that they seem unable to even consider the very real threat of private tyranny , or as Noam Chomsky has described it , \u201c tyranny by unaccountable private concentrations of wealth \u201d ) .
