Martin Dempsey made the remarks to reporters while traveling to Paris to meet with his French counterpart to discuss the situation in Iraq and Syria . The general said that U.S. assessors who had spent the summer observing Iraq 's security forces concluded that 26 of the army 's 50 brigades would be capable of confronting the Islamic State , also known as ISIS .

Sunni resistance led to the relatively brief rise of an extremist group called Al Qaeda in Iraq , led by the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi . That group withered but re-emerged as the Islamic State organization , which capitalized on Sunni disenchantment with the Shiite government in Baghdad .\nOn Tuesday , Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he would consider recommending the return of ground forces to Iraq if an international coalition sought by the Obama administration proves ineffective .\nOn Wednesday , Dempsey said no amount of U.S. military power would solve the problem of ISIS 's takeover of large swaths of northern and western Iraq . The solution , he said , must begin with formation of an Iraqi government that is able to convince the country 's Kurdish and Sunni populations that they will be equal partners with the Shiites in Iraq 's future .\n`` I 'm telling you , if that does n't happen then it 's time for Plan B , '' he said . He did n't say what that would entail .\nDempsey also said that ISIS fighters in Iraq have reacted to weeks of U.S. airstrikes by making themselves less visible , and he predicted they would `` literally litter the road networks '' with improvised explosive devices , or IEDs , in the days ahead . That , in turn , will require more counter-IED training and equipment for the Iraq army , he said .\nAccording to the general , a renewed U.S. training effort might revive the issue of gaining legal immunity from Iraqi prosecution for those U.S. troops who are training the Iraqis .
