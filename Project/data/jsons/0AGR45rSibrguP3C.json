Apparently Trump wasn \u2019 t on board with sanctioning Russia .\nAccording to the Washington Post , after Haley announced the sanctions on CBS \u2019 s Face the Nation Sunday morning , Trump told national security advisers he was \u201c upset the sanctions were being officially rolled out because he was not yet comfortable executing them . \u201d\nIt unclear whether Haley just mistakenly announced the sanctions prematurely before the president had officially signed off on them , or if something else entirely went wrong .\nOn Tuesday , National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow appeared to blame Haley for the mishap , saying she \u201c got ahead of the curve . \u201d\n\u201c She \u2019 s done a great job .
