    "content": "In his first major address to Congress , President Trump will deliver a prime-time \u201c message to the world \u201d Tuesday night by proposing a robust military buildup and corresponding cuts in foreign aid , State Department operations and domestic programs .\nThe president will ask a joint session of Congress to boost national security spending by $ 54 billion , an increase of about 10 percent , to rebuild what Mr. Trump calls the \u201c depleted \u201d military , and to hire more Border Patrol agents and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers .\n\u201c This budget will be a public safety and national security budget , \u201d Mr. Trump said Monday , giving a preview to the nation \u2019 s governors during a White House meeting . \u201c This is a landmark event , a message to the world in these dangerous times , of American strength , security and resolve . \u201d\nBy proposing a corresponding $ 54 billion cut in non-defense programs , White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said , Mr. Trump is calling for \u201c the largest proposed reduction since the early years of the Reagan administration . \u201d\n\u201c It is a true \u2018 America First \u2019 budget , \u201d Mr. Mulvaney said . \u201c It prioritizes rebuilding the military , including restoring our nuclear capabilities , protecting the nation and securing the border , enforcing the laws currently on the books , taking care of vets and increasing school choice . \u201d\nA senior White House official said Mr. Trump \u2019 s speech will be about \u201c economic opportunity and protecting the American people . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Trump invites victims of illegal immigrant crime as guests for speech to Congress\nThe official said much of the speech , which was still being written Monday night , was influenced by the president \u2019 s listening sessions in the past month with health care industry leaders , law enforcement officials , coal miners and other workers .\nMr. Trump will devote the first part of his speech to \u201c promises made and promises kept , \u201d the official said .\nComing on the 40th day of his presidency , Mr. Trump \u2019 s speech also presents an opportunity for him to clarify and give momentum to his plans for repealing and replacing Obamacare , cutting taxes and spurring economic growth .\nIn other years , the presidential speech to lawmakers is known as the State of the Union address . Although Mr. Trump had an abbreviated time frame to prepare the speech this year , he will confront many features of the traditionally partisan spectacle , including an openly hostile Democratic caucus , some 60 members of which who boycotted his inauguration .\nRep. Judy Chu , California Democrat , announced that her guest in the visitor \u2019 s gallery Tuesday night will be Sara Yarjani , an Iranian graduate student who was temporarily barred from entering the U.S. last month after Mr. Trump issued an executive order on extreme vetting of travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries .\nProgressive groups also geared up their opposition to Mr. Trump \u2019 s proposed budget cuts , after eight years of working with a Democratic White House that offered a mostly sympathetic ear at budget time .\n\u201c A budget is a statement of priorities , and with this proposal , Trump is telling America he doesn \u2019 t care about what happens to children who are forced to drink toxic water and breathe polluted air , \u201d said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune . \u201c Trump \u2019 s budget guts the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 the only federal agency charged with keeping our air and water clean \u2014 starves our cherished parks and threatens our wildlife . \u201d\nThe advocacy group ONE , which focuses on combating poverty and diseases , said Mr. Trump \u2019 s proposed cuts to foreign aid are alarming .\n\u201c It \u2019 s also especially ironic , \u201d said Tom Hart , the group \u2019 s executive director for North America . \u201c If your goal is to increase our national security , cutting our foreign assistance budget is one of the last things you should do . \u201d\nCongressional Democrats for years have said that any increase in defense spending must be accompanied by hikes in domestic priorities \u2014 and with President Obama in office , they were able to prevail .\nNow , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , warned of massive cuts to health research , while other Democrats said the administration would have to slash regulators like the agencies that monitor Wall Street .\nOn the other side of the aisle , Mr. Trump \u2019 s defense plans split conservatives .\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain , Arizona Republican , said the $ 54 billion boost would bring defense spending next year to $ 603 billion . He said that was just 3 percent more than President Obama had envisioned .\nMr. McCain said the department needs $ 37 billion more than even Mr. Trump is calling for .\n\u201c With a world on fire , America can not secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obama \u2019 s budget . We can and must do better , \u201d Mr. McCain said .\nBudget analysts , though , said the problem isn \u2019 t too little money , but bad spending decisions .\n\u201c The defense budget is blotted with massive amounts of waste and spending that respond to the military needs of a world that doesn \u2019 t exist anymore , \u201d said Veronique de Rugy , senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University .\n\u201c Any additional increase in defense spending without addressing these issues raises a serious risk that the new injection of funds will once again be allocated based on politics or outdated priorities rather than national security concerns , \u201d she said .\nThe president met at the White House on Monday afternoon with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , to discuss his agenda and the speech .\n\u201c We \u2019 re looking forward to a positive , upbeat presentation , \u201d Mr. McConnell said .\nAsked by reporters whether he was comfortable with the president \u2019 s budget failing to address entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare , Mr. Ryan replied , \u201c Repealing and replacing Obamacare is fundamental entitlement reform . \u201d\nWhite House officials didn \u2019 t specify cuts in discretional spending programs , but they did single out foreign aid , saying it would see \u201c large reductions \u201d in spending .\nThe full budget negotiations between Mr. Trump and Congress will not be complete soon . The administration is expected to submit a more detailed spending plan to lawmakers in May .\nMr. Trump also said his spending plan will contain more spending for infrastructure . He lamented that the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars on military operations in the Middle East over the past two decades without winning wars .\n\u201c We \u2019 re nowhere , \u201d the president said in a meeting with the nation \u2019 s governors . \u201c We don \u2019 t fight to win . We spend $ 6 trillion in the Middle East , and we have potholes all over our roads . \u201d\nThe outlines of his beefed-up military spending received an early endorsement Monday from former President George W. Bush .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s very hard to fight the war on terrorism if we \u2019 re in retreat , \u201d Mr. Bush said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Today \u201d program . \u201c I think we learned that lesson that if the United States decides to pull out before a free society emerges , it \u2019 s going to be hard to defeat them . \u201d\nVirginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe , a Democrat who chairs the National Governors Association , said Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were promoting their plans for increased defense spending in conversations with him , knowing that Virginia has 27 U.S. military installations .\n\u201c I \u2019 m all for defense spending , \u201d Mr. McAuliffe said on MSNBC . \u201c A good question is , \u2018 How will we possibly pay for it ? \u2019 I didn \u2019 t get any details on the other side . \u201d\nThe administration \u2019 s budget envisions economic growth in fiscal 2018 of 2.4 percent . Gross domestic product grew at a tepid 1.6 percent in 2016 ; it was 2.6 percent in 2015 .\nMr. Mulvaney said the administration \u2019 s spending plan would not add to the deficit , which the Congressional Budget Office is projecting at $ 487 billion for fiscal 2018 .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s budget envisions defense spending rising to $ 603 billion .
