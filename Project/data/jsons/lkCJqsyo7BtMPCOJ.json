Ever since Donald Trump dodged Megyn Kelly \u2019 s question on his derogatory comments about women at the first debate with his declaration that \u201c the big problem this country has is being politically correct , \u201d political correctness has been the go-to boogeyman for the entire field of GOP candidates .
