    "content": "Over a decade ago , former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum confessed to this publication that he \u2019 d misjudged the power of his position . \u201c I always believed as a speechwriter that if you could persuade the president to commit himself to certain words , he would feel himself committed to the ideas that underlay those words , \u201d he told writer David Rose . \u201c And the big shock to me has been that although the president said the words , he just did not absorb the ideas. \u201d One imagines that speechwriter and advisor Stephen Miller , articulator of many of Donald Trump \u2019 s clearest expressions of nationalism over globalism , has been encountering similar non-absorbency . Despite all his past declarations of staying clear of Syria , Trump sent 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles its way as punishment for an alleged chemical-weapons attack by the government of Bashar al-Assad against civilians in rebel-held areas . If this was surprising to the Trump non-faithful , it was mainly because of the speed of his reversal and abandonment of previous statements . People had barely slept on the news of the chemical attack before the bombs were flying .\nThere were lots of good reasons to avoid taking the bombardment approach , and they included policy and politics . Syria didn \u2019 t attack the United States and posed no serious threat to U.S. interests . Russians are operating in the region , and even an unintentional casualty of one could lead to a crisis .

Most important , other U.S. interventions in the region have been disastrous .\nWhen the cannons start firing , one thing can lead quickly to another . When George H.W . Bush tried to supply Somalians with food in 1992 , he left Bill Clinton embroiled in that country \u2019 s civil war . When Clinton was teaming up with NATO to bomb Yugoslavia , he also hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade , creating millions of new enemies of the United States . When Barack Obama pushed for a no-fly zone to protect civilians in Libya in 2011 , it quickly morphed into a campaign to unseat Muammar Qaddafi altogether .
