    "content": "Last night on MSNBC 's Hardball , Chris Matthews hit a new level of unhinged when he tied Texas Senator Ted Cruz and the Second Amendment to the murders of prosecutors in Kaufman , Texas and of a prison guard in Colorado . Matthews completely ignores the criminal element of the prosecutor slayings and instead tries to claim the people responsible for the murders are `` using their Second Amendment rights '' to prove a point . More from the Media Research Center :\nLet me start tonight with this , where we are in this country with guns . Guns and the law . Three years ago , a Republican candidate for the Senate out in Nevada said we may need to resort to our Second Amendment remedies if we ca n't get public officials to do what we want . Second Amendment remedies , meaning use our guns guarded by the Second Amendment to deal with people in government we do n't like . If that was frightening enough for you , how about what 's happening in Colorado and Texas ? In Colorado , a top prison official was gunned down in his home . In Texas , two prosecutors were killed , a third has now pulled out of a case against the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas for , quote , `` security reasons . ''\nSo , we have people using guns to settle their disputes with public officials , using their Second Amendment remedies . Do n't like the sound of this ? Think it 's an overstatement ? Well , there come times when overstatement becomes the truth out there . We 've got a Texas senator , Ted Cruz , who wo n't let the Senate hold a democratic vote on gun safety . So , no democracy . We 've got people out there using guns to get even with public officials , intimidating those they do n't kill . This is where we are with guns in this country . Second Amendment remedies being executed on public officials . Refusal by some elected officials to let us have a democratic vote on what to do about it . And this is where we live in April of 2013 .\nThis Second Amendment remedy is no longer the crazy talk of an odd duck Senate candidate out in Nevada , Second Amendment remedies are what you do when you do n't like public officials . You shoot 'em ! And that 's what 's going on now !\nHere we are again with the Left lumping every person with a gun into the Second Amendment . First off , it 's clear Matthews knows nothing about the Kaufman and Colorado cases . He does mention the Aryan Brotherhood as a reason a Houston defense attorney pulled out of a case but fails to mention the prison gang may be behind the murders . Since he failed to inform you about the details of the case , I will :\nOn Saturday , Mar . 30 , the bodies of 23-year Army veteran and Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found in their home , the victims of an apparent assassination .\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity , a law enforcement official described the scene at the McLelland \u2019 s home as \u201c awful , \u201d with \u201c shell casings everywhere. \u201d This caused Forney Mayor Darren Rozell and local defense attorney Eric Smenner both to suggest the McLellands were targeted .\nA national security expert who has spent several years in intelligence gathering operations around the Mexican drug cartels ' criminal insurgency into the continental United States told Breitbart News , `` This assassination of DA McClellend and his wife is meant to send a message : no one is safe , no one is beyond our reach . We will kill you and your loved ones . We are in control here . ''\nCriminals killing public officials is in no way comparable to law abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment rights . Matthews , just like his other buddies on the Left like Jim Carrey , refuses to discuss the criminal elements of this case and others involving firearms because he 's a coward . Matthews is a coward who will stop at nothing to push his false agenda while he smears millions of law abiding citizens in the process . The Kaufman and Colorado killings are n't a result of someone settling their disputes with public officials through the Second Amendment , they 're a result of violent prison gangs working with cartels to show they 're tough .\nThe FBI has declassified 156 pages of internal documents that shed light on the inner workings of the Aryan Brotherhood from its inception in the late 1960s through the 1980s .
