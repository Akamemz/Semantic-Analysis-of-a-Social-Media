( Jeenah Moon/Reuters )\nIt bears no resemblance to reality \u2014 not in police forces , and not in America .\nAbout twice as many white people as black people are killed by police . In fact , in about 75 percent of police shootings , the decedent is not black . Of course , that is not what you would grasp from consuming media .\nTake the website statista.com , specifically its breathless focus on \u201c Hate crime in the United States \u201d \u2014 counterfactually insinuating that any shooting involving a black victim must be a \u201c hate crime. \u201d Here \u2019 s their big headline from Tuesday : \u201c Black Americans 2.5X More Likely Than Whites to Be Killed By Police . \u201d\nIt is fiction . It is sheer demagoguery , peddled as American cities are besieged by rioters in the wake of George Floyd \u2019 s killing by Minneapolis police . The falsity of the claim is demonstrated even by statista.com itself . Just three days ago , the site posted another series of bar graphs , showing that , in fact , whites are nearly twice as likely as blacks to be shot to death by police . Here are the numbers :\nYear White Black 2017 457 223 2018 399 209 2019 370 235 2020 ( so far ) 42 31\nThe rest of the bar graphs break out the numbers of Hispanic decedents ( slightly lower than black , significantly lower than white ) , as well as those whose heritage is described as \u201c other \u201d and unknown .\nRight underneath its chart , statista.com writes , \u201c Sadly , the trend of fatal police shootings in the United States seems only to be increasing. \u201d In point of fact , it is steady \u2014 and if I wanted to play games like statista.com does , by , say , weighting the numbers to account for population growth while ignoring all other relevant factors , I could even pretend that the number was decreasing . The Washington Post acknowledges that fatal shootings by police have run steadily at around 1,000 per year since 2015 \u2014 995 ( 2015 ) , 963 ( 2016 ) , 987 ( 2017 ) , 998 ( 2018 ) , and 1,004 ( 2019 ) .\nAs Heather Mac Donald relates in an insightful Wall Street Journal op-ed , blacks make up only a quarter of the total number of people killed in police shootings annually , a ratio that has held steady since 2015 . The reigning canard , however , is that this 25 percent figure proves racism since African Americans make up just 13 percent of the U.S. population .\nRidiculous as this syllogism is ( as we \u2019 ll see , it conveniently elides more consequential factors ) , it still puts the lie to the slanderous narrative that police are hunting down black men . Even if we ignore the fact that an increasing number of police officers \u2014 obviously including those involved in encounters with black suspects \u2014 are themselves African Americans , the percentage of black deaths from police shootings would be much higher if blacks were being targeted .\nPolice do not go looking for people to shoot . In shooting situations , police are confronting crime suspects , the majority of whom are armed . But given that George Floyd was unarmed , let \u2019 s consider unarmed people killed in such encounters . Such unarmed decedents , too , were twice as likely to be white as black in 2019 \u2014 i.e. , 19 unarmed whites , nine unarmed blacks . As Ms. Mac Donald observes , this ratio is not stable ( and there is some looseness in what the media define as \u201c unarmed \u201d ) : In 2015 , it was 38 unarmed blacks to 32 unarmed whites .\nThe Floyd killing has been injected into the bien pensant narrative of innocent , unarmed black men murdered by cops . But the number of unarmed black men killed by police is vanishingly small . As Mac Donald notes , there were 7,407 black homicide victims in the United States in 2018 , the last year for which final numbers are available . Assuming a comparable number in 2019 , the nine unarmed men killed in police shootings would represent just 0.1 percent of black homicides .\nIn stark contrast , she asserts , \u201c a police officer is 18\u00bd times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer . \u201d\nThe media , the bipartisan political class , the academy , and the commentariat concoct their \u201c systemic , \u201d \u201c institutional , \u201d \u201c unconscious \u201d racism fiction by statistical tunnel vision : We must conclude that African Americans \u2014 in particular , young black men \u2014 are being targeted by police because the percentage of killings of blacks significantly overrepresents the black population .
