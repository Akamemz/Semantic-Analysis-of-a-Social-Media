In New York , anti-Semitic hate crimes were 63 % higher in 2019 than in 2018 , officials say .

It is something where you tend to always look over your back all the time . \u201d\nMore than half the residents in this part of Queens are part of the kaleidoscope of Jewish traditions represented in New York . And yet the Rego Park Jewish Center found it necessary to install bulletproof doors and other security measures .\nRabbi Romiel Daniel felt something particularly poignant this Hanukkah season as he and his congregation sang the words of \u201c Ma \u2019 oz Tsur , \u201d a 13th-century Hebrew poem that is sung each night during the ceremonial lighting of the menorah \u2019 s candles .\n\u201c It is a song about the victory of the weak over the strong , a victory of good over evil , a victory of the holy over the unholy , as such , \u201d says Rabbi Daniel , head of the Rego Park Jewish Center , a synagogue in Queens . \u201c It \u2019 s about the fact that all this was possible , not because of man \u2019 s strength at all , but because God was on our side . \u201d\nBut Ma \u2019 oz Tsur , which recounts the history of God \u2019 s saving acts and is often translated as \u201c Rock of Ages , \u201d also carries a lamentation : \u201c Our salvation takes too long , and there is no end to the bad days , \u201d worshippers sing in the final stanza .\nThere have been at least 10 anti-Semitic attacks in the New York region during this year \u2019 s holiday celebrations , officials say , but many of the city \u2019 s Jewish residents remain most stunned by the attack of a machete-wielding man who burst into a rabbi \u2019 s home in Monsey Saturday evening , injuring five of a group who had gathered to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah .\nThe attack came 2 1/2 weeks after a pair of assailants in Jersey City , New Jersey , a man and a woman , targeted a kosher supermarket in a Jewish neighborhood , shooting and killing four , including a police officer . Since then , Jewish residents , most of them from Orthodox and Hasidic communities , have been accosted on the streets .\nThis April , a gunman shot and killed a worshipper in an attack on a synagogue in Poway , California , wounding three others .
