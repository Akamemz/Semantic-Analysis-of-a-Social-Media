    "content": "Greens who want President Barack Obama to kill the Keystone XL pipeline are adding a new weapon to their arsenal of protests and lawsuits \u2014 the world \u2019 s glut of cheap oil .\nThe same collapse in oil prices that is pumping dollars into motorists \u2019 wallets also risks undermining the case for building the 1,179-mile pipeline in two crucial ways : It \u2019 s squeezing the western Canadian oil industry that has looked to Keystone as its most promising route to the Gulf Coast . And anti-pipeline activists hope that falling prices will make it politically safer for Obama to reject the project , despite the new Republican Congress \u2019 pledges to put Keystone at the top of its 2015 energy agenda .\n\u201c Oil prices going low gives the president a landing place to reject the pipeline because Canada needs cheap and big infrastructure , \u201d said Jane Kleeb , founder of the anti-Keystone group Bold Nebraska . \u201c When oil prices are high , producing the expensive and high-carbon tar sands makes sense . But now that oil is low , the only way tar sands will continue to expand is if Canada gets big pipelines . \u201d\nU.S. oil prices have plunged by nearly half since late June , tumbling to around $ 58 a barrel on Friday , thanks to the refusal of OPEC to cut production amid a glut of global supplies . Gasoline prices have fallen to a five-year low at the same time , reaching a national average of $ 2.60 a gallon Friday morning .\nThe oil price is crucial to the Keystone debate because the latest State Department environmental study on the project says prices in the $ 65-to- $ 75 range are a potential danger zone for oil production in western Canada \u2014 the point where transportation costs driven higher by failing to build the pipeline could \u201c have a substantial impact on \u201d the industry \u2019 s growth .\nCheaper oil also makes it easier to blame Keystone for the greenhouse gases that the Canadian oil fields send into the atmosphere . The State Department study said Keystone would be blameless for all that carbon because Canada is likely to keep pumping more oil even without the pipeline , sending the crude to the U.S. by truck or train if necessary . But the rail and truck options are more expensive \u2014 so if cheap oil makes them no longer cost-effective , greens argue , the pipeline would be the thing that keeps the pollution coming .\nOil prices were nearing $ 100 a barrel when the State Department study came out in January , making the caveats about falling prices seem far-fetched . But now various price analysts , from Goldman Sachs to the Energy Department , are forecasting U.S. oil prices below $ 75 a barrel for 2015 .\nSuch pain in the oil patch delights Keystone \u2019 s enemies , who see the pieces falling into place for Obama to kill the project \u2014 even before a pivotal Nebraska Supreme Court ruling on the pipeline \u2019 s route that might come as early as Dec. 19 . They also like to point to a June 2013 speech in which Obama said the U.S. should approve Keystone \u201c only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution . \u201d\n\u201c It is now impossible to credibly argue that Keystone XL won \u2019 t enable significant expansion of the tar sands and associated climate emissions , \u201d Natural Resources Defense Council international program attorney Anthony Swift said by email . \u201c Plummeting global oil prices have highlighted the fact that tar sands only work in a world of expensive crude \u2014 and without cheap pipeline infrastructure , many carbon-intensive tar sands projects simply will not be built . \u201d\nCanada continues to pin its hopes on the new Republican Congress giving new life to the $ 8 billion pipeline \u2019 s political hopes . But Canada \u2019 s heavy-fuel producers are facing a cash crunch as cheap crude chokes profits for some of the industry \u2019 s most expensive new projects , and Prime Minister Stephen Harper declared last week that trying to regulate oil emissions during the current price crash would be \u201c crazy economic policy . \u201d\nEverywhere you look in the region , companies are cutting back : The company Canadian Oil Sands sliced its 2015 budget nearly in half compared with this year \u2019 s spending . Baytex slashed its dividends to stockholders by more than half , announcing a focus on U.S. oil assets . Cenovus described its 15-percent budget cut for 2015 as \u201c capital restraint in the year ahead in the face of weaker oil prices . \u201d\nKeystone developer TransCanada says its shippers remain committed to the project and points out that existing oil sands projects may be pricey to build but are much cheaper to run , even with a fire sale on crude . The company \u2019 s Keystone president , Corey Goulet , said in an interview that \u201c even one year \u201d of sagging oil prices would not make the pipeline a must-have for Canadian crude producers .\n\u201c Keystone XL is not the driver for increased oil production out of the oil sands , \u201d Goulet said . \u201c It \u2019 s really the long-term price of oil , and even one year is a short time in the types of 20- or 30-year investments these folks are considering . \u201d\nBut Goulet also told a Nebraska radio station last week that the fall of oil prices heightens Keystone \u2019 s importance as a cost-effective alternative to oil-by-rail . Heavy oil producers \u2019 profits \u201c are shrinking because the cost of production remains the same \u201d even as oil becomes cheaper , he said .\nThat plays into greens \u2019 argument that rejecting the pipeline would cut emissions in the oil-sands region because trains aren \u2019 t a viable alternative to Keystone when the price of oil falls . Jason Kowalski , policy director for the climate activists at 350.org , likened Goulet \u2019 s words to a recent pro-pipeline speech in which likely GOP presidential hopeful Chris Christie warned that rejecting Keystone \u201c risks stunting growth \u201d in the oil sands \u2014 inadvertently echoing the greens \u2019 case .\nStephen Kretzmann , founder of the green group Oil Change International , challenged TransCanada \u2019 s portrayal of the current downturn in U.S. oil prices as temporary . Some futures markets see crude staying below $ 75 a barrel \u201c over the next decade , \u201d he said .\n\u201c With oil prices at this level , that makes a significant difference \u201d as Canadian heavy oil companies plan their futures , Kretzmann added .\nSen. Bernie Sanders , one of Congress \u2019 strongest Keystone critics , put it simply : Given the \u201c abundance of oil on the marketplace and prices going down , \u201d there \u2019 s little \u201c need to drill and produce \u201d more of Canada \u2019 s heavy fuel .\nSen. Mike Johanns , a Nebraska Republican who \u2019 s had a front-row seat for his state \u2019 s Keystone drama , said activists \u2019 focus on cheap oil for their anti-pipeline campaigns is \u201c short-sighted thinking \u201d that would \u201c pound consumers \u201d once a shortage of pipelines pushes fuel prices back up .\n\u201c The people who suffer aren \u2019 t Bold Nebraska , \u201d Johanns said in an interview . \u201c It \u2019 s the average guy out there who \u2019 s got to fill up his car . \u201d\nSuch political jostling over the murky nuances of oil markets often glosses over some of the escape hatches in the State Department \u2019 s price scenario : For the death of the pipeline to slow Canadian oil sands growth \u2014 and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 other major export projects for the Canadian fuel would also have to run into problems , the study said .\nThat \u201c pipeline-constrained \u201d scenario was taking shape even before this fall \u2019 s oil crash , thanks to an obstruction campaign by climate activists and indigenous peoples on both sides of the border . Three other massive pipeline projects that would funnel crude from Canada \u2019 s oil-rich Alberta province to its coastlines have met fierce resistance from greens .\nThe other pipelines represent \u201c \u2018 all of the above \u2019 options , \u201d Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Vice President Greg Stringham said by email . \u201c However , Keystone XL is the most direct route to the largest heavy oil market and remains a key part of North American energy security , \u201d he added .\nUniversity of Alberta energy policy professor Andrew Leach has pointed to Canada \u2019 s weak currency as a \u201c shock absorber \u201d that insulates its oil producers from some of the financial pain of plummeting oil .
