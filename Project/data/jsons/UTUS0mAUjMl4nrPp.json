    "content": "Students loved Keith Fink \u2019 s free-speech classes at UCLA . Other professors did not .\nLast week the Chronicle of Higher Education wrote a lengthy report on the curious case of Keith Fink , a part-time lecturer at the University of California , Los Angeles . UCLA refused to renew his contract , writing in a letter that his teaching did not \u201c meet the standard of excellence. \u201d Fink cried foul , arguing that his free-speech classes were popular with students and that he was really fired for his pointed criticisms of the university and his stalwart defense of free speech on campus .\nAnd , in fact , he was popular . As the Chronicle notes , \u201c Student evaluations of the free-speech course Mr. Fink taught this year . . . mostly paint a picture of Mr. Fink as an engaging teacher and his course as stimulating and interesting. \u201d His faculty evaluators , however , believed that there was \u201c more to it than what the students think. \u201d They took issue with his Socratic method of teaching ( common in law schools ) , believed that he pushed his own point of view too much , and raised concerns about the \u201c climate \u201d in the classroom .\nAs I read the story , I had an immediate sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu . I \u2019 ve litigated cases like this before , I \u2019 ve evaluated cases like this before , and I \u2019 m familiar with the extraordinary double standards that define how academic freedom works in modern higher education . Perhaps UCLA is right . Perhaps it has even-handedly applied its alleged \u201c incredibly high \u201d standards and has fired popular left-wing lecturers in part because they \u2019 ve pushed their views too much on their students . Perhaps it routinely fires even popular teachers for poor teaching performance . In other words , perhaps it \u2019 s different from the vast majority of colleges and universities \u2014 schools that have consciously and unconsciously created entire systems of anti-conservative discrimination .\nFirst , let \u2019 s discuss the challenge of even finding a job in higher education . It \u2019 s difficult enough for even well-qualified leftists , but often academic departments define academic positions in such a way that effectively excludes the conservative point of view . Look at this current job posting at Harvard \u2019 s divinity school . It \u2019 s for a tenure-track professor of \u201c religion , violence , and peace-building. \u201d There \u2019 s nothing inherently conservative or liberal about the topic . Indeed , it fascinates me , but hidden within the job description is this gem of a sentence :\nIt is understood that applicants will employ forms of analysis that address race , gender , sexuality , and/or other intersecting forms of social power , such as womanist , feminist , and/or queer approaches . [ Emphasis added . ]\nAhh yes , \u201c intersectionality \u201d rears its radical head . While this posting is extreme ( though at an important institution ) , it perfectly illustrates a long-building phenomenon . Academics have redefined and refocused disciplines to such an extent that they essentially exclude conservative inquiry . Thus , they can honestly say they \u2019 ve never discussed politics in hiring decisions because the discipline itself has narrowed so much that it closes itself to conservatives .\nConsider this statement , years ago , from the American Association of University Professors \u2019 Roger Bowen . He was defending universities from the charge of ideological discrimination in hiring . First , he said this :\nI \u2019 ve been a department chair , I \u2019 ve been a college president . I \u2019 ve conducted more searches than I can begin to describe , and I can tell you I have never asked a candidate what his or her party identification is , and I don \u2019 t know of a search committee in the country that would do that .\nI \u2019 d agree with Bowen . In all my years representing conservative professors , I \u2019 ve never seen questions regarding party identification . But that \u2019 s a red herring . Search committees aren \u2019 t that blatant . They don \u2019 t have to be . Here \u2019 s the key quote :\nAnthropologists \u2014 which apparently , according to the study , Democrats far outnumber Republicans [ among anthropologists ] \u2014 what do they do ? Anthropologists , the discipline itself is focused on questioning religious and cultural myth , particularly myth that celebrates national , cultural or racial superiorities . That in many classrooms will be a shocker for a lot of students . Sociologists tend to inquire on the origins of inequality as a source of alienation : new concepts to many college students that will seem , I imagine , given illustrations using the American example , rather shocking . Political scientists , they focus on questions of legitimacy . . . . Historians , they look at progress frequently in terms of overcoming inequalities of the past , sometimes inequality is endorsed , even embraced by conservatives .\nLeftist academics are often the proverbial fish who don \u2019 t know they \u2019 re wet . They \u2019 ve created and inhabit a world that by its very terms and definitions is inhospitable to conservative thought .\nWell , if you frame scholarship primarily in leftist terms and limit inquiries to more left-leaning areas of interest , it should shock exactly no one that mainly leftists apply .
