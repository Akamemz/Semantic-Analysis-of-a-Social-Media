But the White House this week said his part in Trump \u2019 s winning electoral effort really wasn \u2019 t very large .\nMr. Manafort \u201c played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time , \u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday at his daily briefing .\nDitto longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviser Carter Page . They were 2016 \u201c hangers-on , \u201d said Spicer .\nAnd former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was a \u201c volunteer of the campaign , \u201d said the press secretary , implying he was not someone the Trump team originally recruited .\nWhy does the administration feel a sudden need to distance itself from some past supporters ? Because all the men mentioned had contact with foreigners that will attract FBI scrutiny as the bureau conducts its counterterrorism investigation into the possibility of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nTrump officials almost certainly don \u2019 t know the full extent of the quartet \u2019 s interactions . Manafort in particular has been the subject of allegations linking him to shadowy pro-Kremlin figures in Ukraine .\nBetter to diminish the four men \u2019 s role in team Trump given such known unknowns .\n\u201c The reason they are doing it is it downplays it , makes their involvement seem less than it looks . And it plays into this larger pattern , where [ Trump officials ] basically say we \u2019 re going to try to control reality , \u201d says Chris Edelson , an assistant professor in the department of government at American University .\nForeign contacts are common in political campaigns , especially for experts in international affairs , and aren \u2019 t on their face suspicious . But Manafort , as well as Messrs. Stone , Page , and Flynn are almost certainly in the first cadre of people who will draw FBI attention . If called to testify before Congress , it \u2019 s possible they would invoke the Fifth Amendment .\n\u201c My sense is they probably are already lawyered up , \u201d says Carl Tobias , a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law .\nThis is not an indication they \u2019 re guilty of anything , of course . All have denied they did anything wrong , or that any of their foreign dealings were improper .\nManafort is a veteran Republican lobbyist and political fixer who took over Trump \u2019 s presidential effort in March 2016 and served as unpaid campaign chair until August . He resigned after the Associated Press reported that from 2012 to 2014 his firm had directed a covert Washington influence operation on behalf of Ukraine \u2019 s pro-Russian ruling political party .\nOn Wednesday , the AP further reported that a decade ago Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin . The work appears to contradict assertions by Manafort and the Trump campaign that he has never worked to push Russian government policies , according to the AP .\nStone is a longtime GOP operative and Trump associate who in the final months of the 2016 campaign repeatedly talked about backchannel communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange . He claimed to know in advance about forthcoming leaks of Clinton campaign emails from the group . US intelligence has concluded that Russian government hackers stole the emails to begin with .\nPage is an oil industry consultant who candidate Trump listed as a foreign policy adviser last March . In July , he traveled to Moscow , where he gave a speech that depicted US efforts to promote democracy around the world as hypocritical , according to Rep. Adam Schiff ( D ) , ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee . Page has denied serving as an intermediary between the Trump campaign and Russian officials . President Trump says he \u2019 s never met him .\nFlynn is a retired Army lieutenant general picked as Trump \u2019 s first national security adviser . Administration officials say he was fired after they discovered he had not been forthcoming about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak prior to taking office .\nThe so-called \u201c Steele dossier \u201d ties all these men together . Compiled by Christopher Steele , a former British intelligence officer , this political opposition research document contains some outlandish allegations about Trump behavior . According to news reports , some parts have been verified by US intelligence , but others haven \u2019 t .\nRepresentative Schiff of the Intelligence Committee used the dossier as the basis for much of his opening statement at Monday \u2019 s hearing with FBI Director James Comey . In terms of Trump and Russia , July and August of 2016 were the critical months , Schiff said .\nIn early July , Page traveled to Moscow for his speech . While there , he also met with Igor Sechin , the CEO of the Russian oil giant Rosneft , according to Steele dossier details . He was offered brokerage fees on a 19 percent sale of the company . Reuters has reported that since then a sale of 19.5 percent of the company has taken place . ( Page has said this meeting and offer never occurred . )\nAt this point the Trump campaign was offered documents damaging to Hillary Clinton , published via a third party that would give both sides deniability , said Schiff on Monday , citing the dossier as his source .\nThen Manafort , Page , and Ambassador Kislyak all traveled to Cleveland for the Republican National Convention . Prior to the opening gavel , a section of the GOP platform dealing with US aid to Ukraine was changed to make it more palatable to Moscow .\n\u201c Manafort categorically denies involvement by the Trump campaign in altering the platform .
