    "content": "One year ago , Sen. Chris Murphy sprang into action almost immediately after a gun massacre at an Orlando nightclub \u2014 accusing Congress of an \u201c unconscionable deafening silence \u201d and launching a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor .\nBut the gun-control advocate who once argued that lawmakers should put forward \u201c legislative action within an hour of a shooting \u201d was more circumspect on Wednesday after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in the suburbs of Washington . One tragic incident , he acknowledged , won \u2019 t move the needle \u2014 even one that affected one of their own , House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) .\n\u201c This is very personal . I mean , Steve is a friend of mine and frankly my time this morning has been dedicated just to making sure that my friends are OK , \u201d Murphy said . \u201c The way you talk certainly is affected by the fact that your priority is that the people you know are still alive . \u201d\nThe Connecticut Democrat continued : \u201c We \u2019 re beyond the place where Washington responds to mass shootings . I mean , we don \u2019 t . We don \u2019 t . After Orlando and Sandy Hook , that \u2019 s clearly not how people \u2019 s minds work here . \u201d\nThe shooting Wednesday morning on a sleepy suburban baseball field \u2014 injuring Scalise and four others \u2014 horrified Capitol Hill , which has cycled through repeated rounds of tense battles over gun policy after mass shootings in recent years .\nBut on Wednesday , the tone among even the most ardent proponents of stricter gun laws was dramatically different . In multiple interviews , several Democratic lawmakers urged that no , today was not the day to revive the dormant gun control debate . It was too soon , it hit too close to home \u2014 and lawmakers simply didn \u2019 t want to stand accused of politicizing a shooting that injured a colleague and friend .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know the facts , \u201d pointed out Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-Va. ) , who served as his state \u2019 s governor during the Virginia Tech shootings a decade ago .\nSign up here for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox .

Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) , who helped steer the debate over background checks as Judiciary Committee chairman in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre . \u201c People know my record \u2026 but today is not the day for that . I \u2019 m praying for the victims . I \u2019 m praying for the police officers . \u201d\n\u201c Today we need to focus on what happened and our prayers have to be with the injured , \u201d said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) . \u201c We can talk about other issues in the future . \u201d\nCongressional Democrats have taken notably sharper and more aggressive tactics in recent years when it comes to advocating for tougher gun laws . The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando spurred the most visible action \u2014 not only Murphy \u2019 s filibuster but a sit-in led by House Democrats in the chamber that lasted more than 25 hours and captured national attention .\nBut Democratic lawmakers tiptoed around the gun issue on Wednesday . Notably , several Democrats asked to speak without attribution for fear of being seen as insensitive so soon after one of their colleagues was shot . They acknowledged privately that if the shooting of another colleague \u2014 former Rep. Gabby Giffords ( D-Ariz. ) \u2014 and the mass shooting in Newtown didn \u2019 t move the dial , this won \u2019 t either .\nSenate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois , the No . 2 Senate Democrat and another advocate of stricter gun laws , also spoke about a \u201c feeling of resignation \u201d for his party in the gun debate .\n\u201c Until there \u2019 s significant changes around the country or within Congress , we know each other \u2019 s positions and we know they don \u2019 t change , \u201d Durbin said . \u201c There \u2019 s a fatigue . We know each other \u2019 s arguments . We know what \u2019 s going to happen . \u201d\nDemocrats say they \u2019 re not abandoning their push for tougher gun laws , but they didn \u2019 t think it was appropriate to talk about it too quickly after Wednesday \u2019 s shooting , which occurred around 7 a.m. during the GOP lawmakers \u2019 practice in advance of the annual congressional baseball game Thursday .\nIn this June 16 , 2016 photo , Sen.

Tony Cardenas ( D-Calif. ) said . \u201c And then tomorrow we \u2019 ll probably , hopefully respectfully , get back to the debates of what kind of policies we should have . \u201d\nEven lawmakers who have seen an uptick in death threats against them recently like Rep. Al Green ( D-Texas ) weren \u2019 t ready to revive the gun debate . Green became the target of lynching threats after calling for President Donald Trump \u2019 s impeachment .\n\u201c I think these are issues that I would feel more comfortable discussing a little bit more removed from what happened today , \u201d he told reporters following a briefing for House lawmakers on Wednesday \u2019 s shooting . \u201c I don \u2019 t want someone to think that I \u2019 m seizing on this as an opportunity to get into a debate that may seem political in nature . \u201d\nThere were other differences between shootings that prompted gun control pushes from Democrats and what happened Wednesday , such as that the massacres in Newtown , San Bernardino and Orlando were tragedies of a significantly larger scale , with upwards of dozens of fatalities .\nIn Wednesday \u2019 s shooting , only the suspect \u2014 identified by law enforcement officials as James Hodgkinson , 66 , of Belleville , Illinois \u2014 has died . Hodgkinson had often published social media posts lashing out at Trump and the GOP , stoking concern from Republican lawmakers about whether they will be targeted because of their party label .\nLast June , Democrats in the Senate prompted the most sweeping debate over gun policy since the aftermath of Sandy Hook , when the chamber considered restricting firearms access to those with ties to terrorism and to bolster background checks .

It was ultimately filibustered by nearly all Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the Senate .\nOn Wednesday , Manchin downplayed speculation about whether the shooting would prompt any concrete legislative action tightening rules on gun ownership .\n`` It always spurs that , '' Manchin said of a new gun control push . `` I just do n't get overexcited anymore . ''\nAnother Republican who backed Manchin-Toomey \u2014 Sen. John McCain of Arizona \u2014 said Wednesday that reviving a gun debate would \u201c be fine with me , whenever they want to. \u201d But most other GOP lawmakers have long resisted enacting new and tougher firearms restrictions .\n\u201c I own a gun ; I don \u2019 t go around shooting people with it .
