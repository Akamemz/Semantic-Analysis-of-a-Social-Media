They are mulling whether to stay in Missouri and Colorado \u2014 where for huge swathes of each state, they are the only option left.\n\nThe reason? President Trump.\n\nHe has been threatening to undermine the exchange system, and so Anthem is getting out of some of its shakier positions. It's an object lesson in the weakness of super-complicated programs that require frequent attention from federal authorities. The next time Democrats take a bite at the health-care policy apple, they should strongly prefer big, straightforward options like Medicare for all \u2014 which can survive much better on autopilot.\n\nSo what is Trump doing? He has threatened to cut the insurer subsidies that are built into ObamaCare, and according to Anthem, provided a highly unstable regulatory environment. In a Wall Street Journal article, the company blamed the threats about cost-sharing payments, as well as shrinking markets and \"continual changes in federal operations, rules, and guidance.\" Critically, that reasoning has nothing to do with Ohio in particular, suggesting that if the chaos continues, it will likely pull out of the rest of the exchanges \u2014 throwing hundreds of thousands off their insurance and perhaps leading other insurers to bolt.\n\nThis demonstrates a rather ironic aspect of ObamaCare.
