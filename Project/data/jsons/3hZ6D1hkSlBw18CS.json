What is the likely impact? Might the new rule be overturned in court? Here are some answers:\n\nWhat is the new rule?\n\nFor many noncitizens already in the U.S. legally, the rule broadens the categories of public assistance that, if used, could be held against someone applying for permanent residency \u2013 a green card. Such forms of assistance include Medicaid, food stamps, and subsidized housing.\n\nFor prospective immigrants applying to enter the U.S., immigration officials will judge an applicant\u2019s skills, assets, and health, and thus their ability to avoid reliance on public assistance.

Also exempt are pregnant women, children, refugees, asylum-seekers, and immigrants serving in the U.S. military.\n\nOne challenge comes in \u201cmixed-status\u201d families, and the potential for a chilling effect.
