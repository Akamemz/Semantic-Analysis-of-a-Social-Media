''\nThe author of a controversial memo that sparked debates about gender and diversity at Google sued his former employer on Monday , alleging that the company discriminates against politically conservative white men . James Damore , who was fired in August for internally circulating a manifesto that argued Google \u2019 s gender pay gap was the result of genetic differences that tend to favor men , said in a lawsuit filed in Santa Clara Superior Court that the search giant \u201c singled out , mistreated , and systematically punished and terminated \u201d employees who deviated from the company \u2019 s view on diversity . Damore and a second plaintiff , David Gudeman , another former Google engineer , are seeking class-action status for anyone who identifies as conservative , Caucasian , or male . The men are being represented by Harmeet K. Dhillon , the Republican National Committee \u2019 s committeewoman for California .\n`` ... The presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with 'boos ' during company- wide weekly meetings ''\n\u201c Google \u2019 s management goes to extreme \u2014 and illegal \u2014 lengths to encourage hiring managers to take protected categories such as race and/or gender into consideration as determinative hiring factors , to the detriment of Caucasian and male employees and potential employees at Google , \u201d the suit reads . `` ... Google employs illegal hiring quotas to fill its desired percentages of women and favored minority candidates , and openly shames managers of business units who fail to meet their quotas\u2014in the process , openly denigrating male and Caucasian employees as less favored than others . Not only was the numerical presence of women celebrated at Google solely due to their gender , but the presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with \u201c boos \u201d during company- wide weekly meetings . '' Damore \u2019 s lawsuit is the latest legal challenge for Google , which also faces a suit for unequal pay . Earlier this month , four women plaintiffs , as part of a revised lawsuit , alleged that the company had asked for their previous salaries and had underpaid them compared to their male counterparts . Damore \u2019 s suit , which comes from the opposite end of the spectrum , was expected given his very public hiring of Dhillon in August . That month , the Dhillon Law Group published a blog post asking for anyone who had experienced illegal or retaliatory employment practices to get in touch . `` We look forward to defending against Mr. Damore 's lawsuit in court , '' a Google spokesperson said in a statement .\nIn the 161-page complaint , Damore frames himself as a model Google employee who received eight performance bonuses and $ 150,000 per year in stock bonuses since he started working at the company in the summer of 2013 . Despite this , he was terminated from his job after voicing his complaints about diversity practices and publishing his now-infamous 10-page memo , titled \u201c Google 's Ideological Echo Chamber. \u201d \u201c Damore was surprised by Google \u2019 s position on blatantly taking gender into consideration during the hiring and promotion processes , and in publicly shaming Google business units for failing to achieve numerical gender parity , \u201d reads the suit , following an event in March 2017 in which Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat and Human Resources Director Eileen Naughton allegedly \u201c shamed \u201d managers with less than a 50 % female workforce .\n`` I would welcome the chance to go back to Google and I do feel like I could improve things there . ''\nDamore also says that he felt forced to attend and participate in diversity training events and that he was threatened and insulted by his coworkers following the publishing of his memo . He included an email from another Google employee who promised to \u201c hound \u201d Damore until one of them was fired . Among the suit 's more incendiary claims is that the company endorses `` blacklists , '' which are allegedly meant to highlight employees with conservative views and prevent them from receiving certain jobs or promotions . The lawsuit also alleges that the company maintains separate lists of conservative personalities , including right-wing blogger Curtis Yarvin and InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , to prevent them from stepping foot on Google 's campus . The 28-year-old Damore has remained unemployed since he was terminated from Google , noting in his suit that management did not identify \u201c any Google policy or procedure that Damore had violated .
