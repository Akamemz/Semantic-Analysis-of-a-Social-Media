    "content": "In a border city with generations of connections to Mexico , and generations who came to the U.S. under much different circumstances , the situation is provoking mixed feelings .\nWhat isn \u2019 t disputed is that the people handling the migrant flows in El Paso \u2013 including CBP agents , city government , and volunteer organizations \u2013 are exhausted . The 11-hour-plus work days , buzzing cell phones , and daily chaos is akin to responding to a natural disaster .\nImmigrant advocacy groups dispute that , claiming that the situation has been worsened by policy decisions by the Trump administration .\nWith the southwest border experiencing a surge in migrants , primarily families from Central America seeking asylum , this West Texas city has become ground zero . The commissioner of Customs and Border Protection said the U.S. immigration system had reached a \u201c breaking point \u201d due to \u201c vulnerabilities in our legal framework . \u201d\n\u201c My neighbor \u2019 s actually Border Patrol and he talks about it all the time . Like , \u2018 Dude , I don \u2019 t even know what time I get home , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lopez .\nJavier Lopez and Lalo Garcia are playing chess in San Jacinto Plaza . Both men are in their 20s , and both have lived in the city for the four big migrant influxes it has experienced . They have never seen anything like this one , they agree .\nA friend from another church had called . Immigration agents would be releasing 152 migrants , their processing and background checks completed . Could he take them ?\nMr. Cabrera , an associate pastor at the Caminos de Vida church , said he needed time to think . We need an answer now , his friend replied .\nThat left 30 minutes to prepare , and all the church had was a 24-pack of bottled water . By the end of the day , members of the congregation and the community had brought beans , rice , clothes , and blankets . By the end of the week , Caminos de Vida had so many supplies they were helping other churches hosting migrants .\n\u201c The amazing thing is , we just said \u2018 yes. \u2019 That \u2019 s all we did , \u201d says Mr. Cabrera . \u201c This is what happens when a community gets together and does something and moves on their own . \u201d\nSince the call , Caminos de Vida has been taking in 50 migrants every few days , feeding them , clothing them , and arranging transportation to family or friends in the United States . They are starting to feel the strain , he says while preparing to welcome another 50 migrants . The water bill jumped from $ 80 to $ 500 ; volunteers , many of them elderly , are burning out ; and some members of the congregation have left , uncomfortable with what the church is doing .\nThat tension permeates El Paso . With the entire southwest border experiencing a surge in migrants , primarily families and children from Central America seeking asylum , this West Texas city has become ground zero . Kevin McAleenan , commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) , came here last week and announced that the U.S. immigration system had reached a \u201c breaking point \u201d due to \u201c vulnerabilities in our legal framework . \u201d\nImmigrant advocacy groups dispute that , claiming that the situation on the southwest border has been worsened by policy decisions by immigration agencies and the Trump administration .\nWhat isn \u2019 t disputed is that the people handling the migrant flows in El Paso \u2013 including CBP agents , city government , and volunteer organizations \u2013 are exhausted . The 11-hour-plus work days , buzzing cell phones , and daily chaos is akin to responding to a natural disaster .\nIf you \u2019 re not a part of those groups , the surge in asylum seekers has remained mostly invisible on the ground . In a border city with generations of connections to Mexico , and generations who came to the U.S. under much different circumstances , the situation is provoking mixed feelings .\nOn a sunny Monday afternoon , Javier Lopez and Lalo Garcia are playing chess in San Jacinto Plaza . Both men are in their early 20s , and both have lived in the city for the four big migrant influxes it has experienced . They have never seen anything like this one , they agree .\n\u201c My neighbor \u2019 s actually Border Patrol and he talks about it all the time . Like , \u2018 Dude , I don \u2019 t even know what time I get home . It \u2019 s just crazy because we \u2019 re shorthanded , \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lopez .\nThe volume of asylum requests bothers him though . \u201c I feel like this is a safe haven for everybody , and sooner or later it \u2019 s going to be crowded or some other problems are going to come up , \u201d he says .\nMr. Garcia jumps in . \u201c Put yourself in their shoes , \u201d he says . \u201c A lot of people come trying to survive . Not all of them , but most of them , \u201d he continues . \u201c Which is the controversy . We get hit by that , but they need it . So , honestly , it \u2019 s up to your morals whether you want to help or not . \u201d\nCommissioner McAleenan has described how he thinks the immigration system needs to change .\nBorder Patrol is projecting that 100,000 migrants will have crossed the southwest border legally and illegally in March , the highest single month figure in a decade . The El Paso sector , which includes West Texas and New Mexico , has seen some of the sharpest increases in recent months . But those crossing are now mostly family units and unaccompanied children , and that change in demographics has forced the CBP in particular to do things it is not used to doing .\nThe agency has begun medical screening for every child 17 and under taken into custody , a policy Mr. McAleenan called \u201c unprecedented. \u201d And last week , for the first time in a decade , the CBP began releasing migrants directly after they have been processed due to overcrowding in Border Patrol stations and a lack of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) bed space .\nThe agency has reassigned 750 agents from four other ports of entry to process asylum-seekers , and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sent a letter to Homeland Security employees last week asking for volunteers to help on the southwest border .\n\u201c This humanitarian mission which we are committed to is undermining our border security efforts , \u201d said Mr. McAleenan last week . \u201c Changes in the law and closing the vulnerabilities in our legal framework is the only way that this flow is going to be reduced . \u201d\nEl Paso City Council meetings these days have come to include similar statements about the need for immigration reform .\nCertain laws passed in recent years , Mayor Dee Margo said during a meeting this week , \u201c amounts to basically unfettered asylum-seeking . We \u2019 re a humanitarian nation . People are coming for their families , economic benefits , but it \u2019 s a challenge to us . \u201d\nLast week , the city appropriated $ 20,000 to the United Way to fund a volunteer coordinator position , and they \u2019 re now helping Annunciation House \u2013 a nonprofit shelter that has been managing the network of more than two-dozen volunteer organizations \u2013 open a new 500-bed hospitality center for migrants .\nIf there is a face for the citizen response in El Paso , it is Ruben Garcia , the director of Annunciation House . He calls and texts with CBP and ICE every day , and calls and texts other churches and volunteer groups to see who could take the migrants in .\nBut he \u2019 s begun to notice what he calls a \u201c concerning \u201d trend . When ICE releases migrants , it contracts with private companies that can transport migrants up to eight hours away \u2013 so when bed-space is low in El Paso , migrants can be taken to shelters in Las Cruces and Albuquerque , New Mexico . The CBP doesn \u2019 t have that ability , but the volume of their releases has been increasing , according to Mr. Garcia , from 115 last Thursday to 240 this Monday .\nThose releases are \u201c basically going to be restricted to El Paso , \u201d he said in a press conference .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not sure exactly where Border Patrol is headed in terms of the releases , \u201d he added . \u201c I very much hope [ it ] does not have a political component to it . \u201d\nCBP did not respond to specific questions about their migrant releases by deadline .\nThere have been other instances of political manipulation of the immigration bureaucracy , others believe .\nPerhaps the most dramatic example was the housing of hundreds of migrants in an outdoor shelter under the Paso del Norte Bridge last week . CBP say they initially opened that camp to deal with the large increase in migrants . Another is \u201c metering , \u201d a policy that limits the flow of asylum claims processed at official ports of entry . Last summer , CBP officials expanded the practice to ports of entry in every border state , causing wait times to stretch for months and more migrants to cross illegally .\nXochitl Rodriguez , a community activist , says it sometimes \u201c feels like we are the target , like they \u2019 re trying to break \u2026 the community down . \u201d\nShe has been volunteering at migrant shelters , preparing food \u2013 usually pozole soup and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches .
