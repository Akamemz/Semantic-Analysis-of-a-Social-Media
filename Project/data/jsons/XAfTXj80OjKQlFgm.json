Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , we \u2019 ve talked a lot about Hillary Clinton , and she did get a lot of negative attention this past week over these\u2014the revelations of the Associated Press , but not as much as she would have , because of all that Donald Trump has been saying and tweeting and representing . Glenn Greenwald , what are your comments on Hillary Clinton \u2019 s opponent , Donald Trump ?\nGLENN GREENWALD : I mean , Donald Trump is\u2014I mean , the tactic of the Democratic Party in the last 25 years\u2014they know that ever since they became the party of sort of corporatism and Wall Street , they don \u2019 t inspire anybody , so their tactic is to say the Republican Party is the epitome of evil . Even when they have conventional nominees like Mitt Romney or John McCain , they demonize them and say they \u2019 re this unparalleled threat to democracy . In this election , just by coincidence , it happens to be true .\nThe person that the Republican Party has nominated , on a personal level , is extraordinarily unstable and vindictive and dangerous and narcissistic , in a way that you really wouldn \u2019 t trust him to occupy any minor political office , let alone command the military of the United States and the entire executive branch . The rhetoric that he \u2019 s been embracing over the past 18 months is extraordinarily frightening , because , even if he loses , he is emboldening extremist nationalism , racism , all kinds of bigotry . He \u2019 s giving license for its expression . He is serving as a galvanizing force for these very dangerous elements , not just in the American political culture , but in Europe and elsewhere throughout the right . And it \u2019 s just unthinkable to allow him anywhere near the White House , given the things that he wants to do , from deporting 11 million people to barring all Muslims from entering the country , and so many of the other things that he \u2019 s said . Even though he \u2019 s so unstable you don \u2019 t know if he would do any of them , the instability itself is so risky .\nAnd so , this has become the real problem , is he is such a kind of dangerous presence on the American landscape that a lot of people have become afraid of doing their jobs and scrutinizing his opponent . And I think that that also is quite dangerous , even though I understand the motives behind it .\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you , Glenn , about a piece you just recently wrote . It \u2019 s headlined \u201c As Israel Prospers , Obama Set to Give Billions More in Aid While Netanyahu Demands Even More. \u201d Explain .\nGLENN GREENWALD : You know , one of the things that happens during the election campaign is that all the focus of the media , and therefore the American public , goes to the personalities of the two candidates , and the U.S. government does incredibly important things , consequential things , that get ignored . And that \u2019 s a perfect example .\nSo , the United States already is by far the biggest benefactor of the Israeli government . We already give $ 3 billion a year in taxpayer money , in military aid , all sorts of other forms of aid , including diplomatic cover as they bomb Gaza , as they occupy the Palestinians , as they violate international law . It \u2019 s because the U.S. government enables this . And we transfer all this money to Israel , even though , in many ways , Israel is more prosperous and thriving and its citizens enjoy more benefits than American citizens do , including universal healthcare and free college , which Israelis enjoy but the U.S. doesn \u2019 t , as we transfer billions of dollars to them .\nAnd so , one of the things that President Obama is doing , with almost no attention , is he has negotiated a deal with Israel to significantly increase the amount of money that Israel gets for 10 years , so no government , no future Congress can even reverse it , to give them many , many billions more than we \u2019 re already giving them .
