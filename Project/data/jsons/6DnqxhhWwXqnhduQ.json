But one is created more equal than others . And his name is Donald Trump .\nThe US president \u2019 s unique interpretation of the declaration of independence was on full display on Thursday when he staged a militaristic , jingoistic and untraditional jamboree at the Lincoln memorial in Washington to celebrate the Fourth of July .\nTrump did not fulfil his critics \u2019 worst fears of a politically partisan , campaign-style rally with his \u201c Salute to America \u201d event . Indeed , in a rare plea for unity as he spoke beneath the statue of Abraham Lincoln , he told the crowd : \u201c We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny . We all share the same heroes , the same home , the same heart , and we are all made by the same almighty God . \u201d\nThe president did , however , provide the bombastic show of military might that had been widely predicted . Whereas he once liked to build suspense as host of the reality TV show The Apprentice , Trump now has the world \u2019 s most fearsome arsenal at his disposal \u2013 and he showed it off .\nDonald Trump delivers July 4th speech \u2013 live Read more\nHe relished introducing F-22 Raptors and a B-2 stealth bomber that roared loudly over the Washington monument , the reflecting pool and the Lincoln memorial .

USA ! \u201d\nThe showman president , speaking behind rain-streaked bulletproof glass screens , grinned widely and declared : \u201c Great country ! \u201d\nThere were several more flypasts in the cloudy sky by the plane known as Air Force One when the president is aboard , as well as army , navy , coast guard and Marine Corps aircraft and , climactically , six Blue Angel F-18s . The controversial event also included two Abrams tanks and two Bradley fighting vehicles .\nIn a speech that lasted 47 minutes , Trump laboured over a heroic version of American military history , telling stories not only of the revolutionary war that won independence from Britain but the civil war ( \u201c Damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead ! \u201d ) and the second world war . He summoned military leaders to the podium , paid tribute to gold star families and at one point referenced his proposed space force .\nThe president sailed close to one of his campaign lines when he claimed , \u201c our nation is stronger than it ever was before \u201d , but otherwise swerved past party politics for once . \u201c For Americans , nothing is impossible , \u201d he said , reciting a litany of American accomplishments over its history , including the moon landing 50 years ago , and promised \u201c very soon , we will plant the American flag on Mars . \u201d\nTrump had repeatedly dismissed accusations that he was politicising an important holiday , emulating displays in authoritarian countries and wasting taxpayers \u2019 money with the event , which the National Parks Service reportedly re-directed $ 2.5m in park entrance fees to help pay for .\nWhite House 'struggles to draw crowds ' to Trump 's Fourth of July show Read more\nThousands of people had gathered on the national mall , many wearing \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d hats , and some waved \u201c Trump 2020 \u201d banners .
