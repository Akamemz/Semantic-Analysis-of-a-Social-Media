Chris Collins ( R-NY ) was arrested Wednesday on federal charges of insider trading for allegedly using his position at a pharmaceutical company to leak information to his son , who then used it to dump company stock before it crashed . He is also charged with lying to the FBI about those trades .\nHours later , Collins called the charges \u201c meritless \u201d , and said he would still run for re-election , but House Speaker Paul Ryan temporarily booted him from the House Energy and Commerce Committee until the House Ethics Committee reviews the matter .\nCollins sat on the board of directors of Innate Immunotherapeutics , an Australian pharmaceutical company where he was also lead shareholder . Cameron Collins , his son , was also a shareholder , as was Cameron \u2019 s father-in-law to-be . All three have been charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud by the U.S. Attorney \u2019 s Office for the Southern District of New York .\n\u201c Representative Collins , who , by virtue of his office , helps write the laws of this country , acted as if the law did not apply to him , \u201d U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Berman said at a press conference . \u201c These charges are a reminder that this is a nation of laws , and everyone stands equal before the bar of justice . \u201d\nAll three defendants pleaded not guilty at their arraignment in a Manhattan federal courtroom . A judge released them each on the condition that they get two people to co-sign a $ 500,000 bond .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Collins will not serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee \u201c until this matter is settled . \u201d\nInnate was anxiously awaiting the results of an FDA trial for its experimental multiple-sclerosis drug in 2017 when it got news the drug had failed its latest clinical trial . Innate \u2019 s CEO informed Collins and his colleagues on the company \u2019 s board of directors of the devastating news via email .\nMinutes later , Collins frantically called his son from a congressional picnic at the White House . After trying six times , Collins finally got through to Cameron and allegedly told him Innate \u2019 s drug was a bust . Cameron then gave the news to his fianc\u00e9e Lauren Zarsky \u2019 s family , who were also invested in Innate : Zarsky \u2019 s father Stephen , her mother Dorothy , and Stephen Zarsky \u2019 s friend . ( Stephen Zarsky also allegedly tipped off his brother , his sister , and a long-standing friend , who were all invested in Innate . )\nIronically , it was Cameron who convinced the family to invest in the first place , according to the indictment .\nWhen U.S. markets opened the following morning , Cameron placed an order to sell 16,508 shares of Innate stock . Over the next few days , he placed dozens more orders . Cameron was on the phone with his father when he placed an order to dump 50,000 shares , according to the indictment .\nThe government said the trades allowed them all to \u201c avoid over $ 768,000 in losses that they would have otherwise incurred if they had sold their stock in Innate after the drug trial results became public . \u201d\nWhen the news finally did go public , Innate \u2019 s stock dropped 92 percent in value in one day .\nThough Collins is accused of providing inside information , he did not trade on it because his Innate shares were listed on the Australian stock exchange , where trading was halted ahead of the announcement of the results of the drug trial ( a precautionary measure designed to avoid the exact type of insider trading Collins is accused of helping his son and Zarsky take part in ) .\n\u201c We will answer the charges filed against Congressman Collins in Court and will mount a vigorous defense to clear his good name , \u201d they said . \u201c It is notable that even the government does not allege that Congressman Collins traded a single share of Innate Therapeutics [ sic ] stock . We are confident he will be completely vindicated and exonerated . \u201d\nAs Collins \u201c well knew , he was virtually precluded from trading his own shares for practical and technical reasons , \u201d which included the Australian trading halt , the government said . Additionally , the government noted , \u201c Collins was already under investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics ( OCE ) in connections with his holdings in , and promotion of , Innate . \u201d\nIndeed , just days before the alleged insider trading , he was interviewed by the OCE about his dealings with Innate . OCE recommended the House Ethics Committee probe Collins over his apparent use of office to benefit Innate . Berman declined to answer whether his office received a referral from OCE .\nCollins \u2019 s son and Zarsky are also charged with lying to the FBI . They and Collins also face counts of wire fraud and mail fraud .\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission also announced Wednesday it settled insider trading charges against Lauren and Dorothy Zarsky . Both agreed to pay five-figure fines , the SEC said .\nSince he was elected to Congress in 2012 , Collins has risen to become one of President Donald Trump \u2019 s most vocal supporters . The first member of Congress to endorse Trump for president , Collins became one of the president \u2019 s most vocal supporters , seen often on cable news steadfastly defending him .

Shareholders included his two children , four campaign donors , his chief of staff , and six Republican congressman .\nFor the past year and a half , reporters across a variety of publications , including The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , raised serious questions about conflicts of interest with Collins \u2019 s dual positions as a lawmaker and director at Innate .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 partner Kaiser Health News was the first to report on Collins \u2019 s intimate relationship with Innate , which included investments from Collins \u2019 s family , friends , and business associates .
