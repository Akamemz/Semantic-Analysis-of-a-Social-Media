''\nPolitico obtained the chapter ahead of a Friday confab where Democratic national security experts and communicators will be briefed on Benghazi by Philippe Reines , a longtime Clinton adviser and spokesman .\nHouse Republicans have continued to pressure Clinton on Benghazi and earlier this month organized a select committee to investigate the terrorist attack . Democrats contend that the investigation is nothing more than a political tool to criticize Clinton as she mulls a run at the presidency in 2016 .\nWhile it is likely that Republicans will call on Clinton to testify before the select committee , Clinton casts doubt on her participation in the investigation , according to the report by Politico 's Maggie Haberman , who is also a CNN political analyst\n`` I will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans , '' Clinton writes . `` It 's just plain wrong , and it 's unworthy of our great country . Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me .

But there is a difference between unanswered questions and unlistened to answers . ''\nGOP chairman of Select Benghazi Committee reacts to Hillary Clinton book chapter\nThe U.S. consulate in Benghazi was attacked on September 11 , 2012 . Four Americans , including Ambassador Chris Stevens , were killed . Initially , the attack was thought to be perpetrated by an angry mob responding to a video made in the U.S. which mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed , but was later determined to be a terrorist attack .\nQuestions about Benghazi have dogged Clinton since the attack and some have questioned whether the former first lady is to blame for Stevens ' death - the first U.S. ambassador killed on duty in over 30 years .\nEarlier this year , Clinton said that Benghazi was her biggest regret during the four years she served as America 's top diplomat . `` It was a terrible tragedy losing four Americans , two diplomats and now it is public so I can say two CIA operatives , '' Clinton said at a speech in New Orleans .\nClinton has also taken responsibility for the deaths and did so , according to Politico , in the memoir chapter , too .\n`` As Secretary I was the one ultimately responsible for my people 's safety , and I never felt that responsibility more deeply than I did that day , '' she writes .\nClinton testified about the attack in House and Senate hearings in 2013 . Republicans , however , say there are still questions left unanswered and some contend that the attack should disqualify the former secretary of state from holding future office .\nAccording to Politico , Clinton responds to some Republican questions on Benghazi , including claims that military assets were not scrambled in time to aid the compound and that requests for more security for the compound were ignored by the secretary of state .\n`` Our military does everything humanly possible to save American lives \u2013 and would do more if they could , '' Clinton writes according to Politico . `` That anyone has ever suggested otherwise is something I will never understand . ''\nThe former first lady also defends then-U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice , who used five Sunday talk show appearances soon after the attack to link the deaths to the anti-Islam video posted to YouTube .\n`` Susan stated what the intelligence community believed , rightly or wrongly , at the time , '' Clinton writes , according to Politico . `` That was the best she or anyone could do . ''\nRepublicans contend that the talking points that link the attack to the video show the White House was playing politics with Benghazi because President Barack Obama 's 2012 re-election was just two months away .\nAs to why Rice rather than Clinton appeared on the Sunday shows , Clinton writes , `` I do n't see appearing on Sunday-morning television as any more of a responsibility than appearing on late-night TV . Only in Washington is the definition of talking to Americans confined to 9 A.M. on Sunday mornings . ''\nCNN confirmed that Tommy Vietor , a National Security Council spokesman during Obama 's first term , has been brought on by the Clinton team to coordinate and assist in the response to the book .\nThe hiring of Vietor , whose time with the President dates back to Obama \u2019 s days in the Senate and who has ties to both Clinton and Obama 's closest advisers , signals a closer cooperation between the White House and Clinton 's staff on communicating the news from Clinton 's book .\nIn another sign of stepped up cooperation , Democratic surrogates and communicators who publicly support both Obama and Clinton met at the White House this week with Communications Director Jenn Palmieri and Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes to talk about a number of issues , including Benghazi and Clinton 's upcoming book , according to a source familiar with the meeting .\nWhile the topic was not on the official meeting agenda , one surrogate asked about it and the President \u2019 s aides made clear they want no daylight between Obama and Clinton on foreign policy issues as the book rolls out , the source added .
