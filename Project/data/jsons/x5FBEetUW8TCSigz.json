    "content": "As Bob Corker ambled down from the Senate chamber last week , he wore a knowing smile : Immigration reform wasn \u2019 t going to squeak through the Senate \u2013 it was going to pass big .\nOn that Monday , an amendment co-authored by Senator Corker , a Tennessee Republican , and Sen. John Hoeven ( R ) of North Dakota passed a procedural hurdle that signaled that more than a dozen Republicans and several previously shaky conservative Democrats would be there in the end , giving the bill the sweeping , bipartisan backing its authors hoped would power the immigration debate forward in the reluctant House of Representatives .\nLeaning in to a crush of reporters , the affable Corker was midway through a riff on the amendment when , apropos of nothing , he paused .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve enjoyed the work I \u2019 ve done over the last two weeks on this bill more than anything I \u2019 ve done in the United States Senate , \u201d he said with a grin . \u201c I think it \u2019 s important work , I \u2019 m glad to have been involved in it , and certainly gratified by the vote . \u201d\nRare sentiments , says Ross Baker , a political scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey , for a member of a legislative body wracked by gridlock . `` Elation is not a common emotion in the United States Senate these days , \u201d he says .\nBut Corker , a construction entrepreneur and a former mayor of Chattanooga , Tenn. , draws an electric joy from the pursuit of the deal , and if he has anything to say anything about it , the immigration pact won \u2019 t be the only major accord Congress strikes before this term is out .\nWhile Washington 's dysfunction almost led him to quit the Senate after one term in 2012 , Corker \u2019 s dogged effort to broker compromises on a handful of major issues bespeaks a senator who is arguably the body \u2019 s happiest warrior , plunging into issues from Benghazi to the budget with aplomb .\n\u201c He \u2019 s passionate , he cares , he \u2019 s trying to figure out how to get to yes , \u201d says Sen. Max Baucus ( D ) of Montana , a six-term lawmaker famous for infuriating his fellow Democrats in his search for bipartisan solutions . \u201c He reminds me of some of the greats who have been up here with us . \u201d\nThe Volunteer State \u2019 s junior senator seems intent on generating plenty of positive momentum all by himself , taking on enough issues to stuff an ordinary member \u2019 s schedule for an entire career .\nOn the same day the Senate approved the immigration bill , Corker unveiled sweeping legislation with kindred spirit Sen. Mark Warner ( D ) of Virginia to wind down the government-sponsored housing goliaths , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . That bill , which would fundamentally reshape the American mortgage industry , has a bipartisan posse of six co-sponsors on the Senate Banking Committee .\nJust before the final immigration vote , Corker broke away from the Capitol for lunch with a bipartisan , bicameral group of lawmakers led by Senator Baucus and Rep. Dave Camp ( R ) of Michigan to talk about another mega-goal : a comprehensive rewrite of the nation \u2019 s tax code .\nIn previous weeks , he \u2019 s been among Republican senators who met with Obama administration officials to lay the groundwork for negotiations to head off another calamitous showdown over the federal debt ceiling this fall . ( He delivered his own 200-plus-page plan that would have cut the deficit by $ 4.5 trillion over the next decade , including $ 1 trillion in new tax revenue and a revamp of Medicare , to congressional leaders in the aftermath of the 2012 election . )\nAnd as the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Corker and chairman Bob Menendez ( D ) of New Jersey are trying to reassert some congressional power in the foreign policy realm . Corker will soon travel overseas to investigate pressing American foreign policy issues , but the details of that trip are being withheld for security reasons .\n\u201c The executive branch has taken foreign policy totally over ; Congress plays almost no role , \u201d Corker says . \u201c And , candidly , people in Congress like it that way because foreign policy issues don \u2019 t play so well back home sometimes and you \u2019 re never held accountable for the decisions that are made . \u201d\nWhether judged by his workload over the past fortnight or in previous legislative successes such as playing a key role in shaping the bailout of America \u2019 s auto companies or crafting a chunk of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill with Senator Warner , Corker has been able to cram so much onto his plate by , well , cramming .\nLeaning on habits of study and research that helped him build two construction companies into a $ 20 million fortune ( Corker donates the entirety of his Senate salary to the Community Foundation of Greater Chattanooga ) , his days are stuffed with briefings \u201c nonstop , \u201d he says .\nAs a junior member , Corker discovered , the only way to break through the Hill \u2019 s often-stultifying seniority system and get a seat at the table on pressing problems is to bring more intellectual and policy firepower than everybody else and hope for the best .\nWhen a senator does not have a top committee post , \u201c the only other way to really be involved is to know more than anybody else about a given topic , \u201d he says . \u201c You never know when the timing is going to hit in a such a way that you \u2019 re going to make a difference . \u201d\nWarner , another executive-minded lawmaker ( he was governor of Virginia ) with a business background , sought out Corker after admiring how the Tennessean assiduously worked on the auto bailout , including opening direct lines of communication with auto executives . The two sat together at President Obama \u2019 s first inauguration and have been fast friends ever since .\nWarner attributes Corker \u2019 s successes to a chief advantage that those with private-sector backgrounds have over colleagues who are steeped in politics .\n\u201c In politics , you can have a whole successful career where you simply point out what \u2019 s wrong with the other guy , \u201d Warner says . \u201c In business , no matter how good you are at criticizing the competition , if you didn \u2019 t put out a good product , you didn \u2019 t sell something , ultimately , you \u2019 d go out of business . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not only junior lawmakers who have taken a shine to Corker .\nIt wasn \u2019 t an accident that Corker ( or Senator Hoeven , for that matter ) were in the mix on immigration , an issue on which neither has any background , says Professor Baker . The two senators are among a handful of conservatives that Democratic Senate leaders see as practical , fair-minded partners who carry enough weight in their own conference to make other Republicans take notice .\nThe trust of Democratic leaders like Sen. Charles Schumer ( D ) of New York , with whom Corker worked on the immigration compromise , is doubly impressive considering that Corker has served as member of his own party \u2019 s Senate leadership team since 2011 .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a conservative , \u201d Baker says , \u201c but you don \u2019 t have to be a moderate to be a dealmaker . In fact , being a moderate may lessen your value .... Bob Corker is not always \u2018 gettable \u2019 [ to vote for a bill ] . So when he gets drawn into something , people are more apt to notice . \u201d\n\u201c It turns out in the strange , exotic world of the Senate there are people who are identified as dealmakers even though they may have reliably ideological votes , \u201d says Baker . \u201c They are people who turn up at the right time . \u201d\nWhen Corker was the only freshman Republican senator in the Democratic wave of 2006 , the timing hardly seemed auspicious . He quietly took a seat on the Banking Committee , where he thought his private-sector background would be put to good use .

Bitter partisanship and gridlock were making the guy with all the briefing books miserable .\n\u201c If your focus in life is on being productive , \u201d says Corker , \u201c when things are not happening ... one has to ask oneself , \u2018 Is this worth a grown man \u2019 s time ? \u2019 \u201d\nIn the end , he decided , there was only one way the Senate could go : up .\n\u201c I think we have talent in the Senate that is oriented toward solving problems .
