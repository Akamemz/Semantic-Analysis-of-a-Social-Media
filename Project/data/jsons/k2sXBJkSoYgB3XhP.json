    "content": "President Barack Obama opened this year 's congressional election season with a State of the Union message centered on economic inequalities , a theme harder to sustain in scattered House and Senate contests .\nMapping out his goals to assist those struggling amid a broader recovery , the president in last night 's address called for extending unemployment benefits , an increase in the minimum wage to $ 10.10 from $ 7.25 , a new retirement savings program , and more affordable college education .\nDo You Approve Or Disapprove of President Obama 's Job Performance ? Vote Now in Urgent Poll\n`` Corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher , and those at the top have never done better , '' Obama said . `` But average wages have barely budged . Inequality has deepened . Upward mobility has stalled . The cold , hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery , too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by \u2014 let alone get ahead . And too many still are n't working at all . ''\nDemocrats are echoing such themes on Capitol Hill , yet political strategists say they may not be as potent as they were in 2012 when Obama ran against Mitt Romney , a multimillionaire former private-equity executive caught on videotape suggesting that 47 percent of Americans view themselves as victims dependent on government checks .\n`` It worked great for the Democrats because Romney was the very profile they were running against , '' said Stu Rothenberg , a Democrat and the editor of the Washington-based nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .\nIncome-equality themes are also stronger in presidential years because a broader swath of the electorate typically participates , while midterm voters tend to be wealthier and more Republican .\nIn the 2010 midterms , 64 percent of voters nationally had incomes of $ 50,000 or more , compared with 59 percent in the 2012 presidential election , according to exit polls . Those surveys also show 42 percent of 2010 voters described themselves as `` conservative , '' significantly higher than the 35 percent who said that in 2012 .\nRepublicans are also sticking with a once-winning message : attacking the Affordable Care Act as too expensive and unworkable . Public concerns about the healthcare law helped them retake control of the House in 2010 .\nOn \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV , conservative analysts Dick Morris and Allen West said Obama 's proposals were costly , ineffective , and likely designed more to rally the Democratic base than to fix the economy .\n`` What I saw [ in the speech ] , it was carefully selected political fights that really put the Republicans in a tough position along the lines of income inequality , minimum wage , unemployment benefits , and women 's pay , '' said West , a former Republican representative from Florida . `` He was very confrontational . When you ask me about humility , I did n't see any of it . ''\nMorris , meanwhile , found that Obama 's lack of admission to the numerous errors surrounding the Affordable Care Act rollout was tantamount to being `` ashamed '' without having to apologize . He , too , thinks the minimum wage and other issues are designed to distract from the Obamacare debacle .\n`` I mean it 's his signature program and he let the whole speech go by before he talked about it . I 've written two State of the Union speeches . My attitude here is that this one was very boring , very hard to listen [ to ] , '' added Morris , a former adviser to President Clinton , saying the address lacked the strength of presenting `` bite-sized achievements '' while going overboard on `` trying to govern through executive action . ''\nDemocratic political analyst and pollster Doug Schoen told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the address itself was largely `` a rehash of what we 've heard before : 'Thank you very much , goodnight . ' ''\n`` It provided nothing that will demonstrate leadership to the American people , '' he said . `` He made a real effort to connect with people by using individual examples , but I 'm not sure if he achieved much of anything . ''\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida also had sharp criticism for the president 's expanded authority and the plan to push a minimum wage hike .\n`` I think it 's unfortunate . I think it 's divisive and , quite frankly , borderline unconstitutional on many of those issues , '' Rubio told Politico . `` I understand the [ legislative ] process takes long and can be frustrating , but I think it truly undermines the republic .

The results will shape the final two years of Obama 's presidency and determine how much resistance he 'll encounter from Congress .\nMike Murphy , a Republican consultant who has advised several presidential campaigns , said his party ca n't ignore the potential power of Obama 's message and simply propose tax cuts as their sole idea for economic opportunity .\n`` We should take the president 's campaign offense seriously , '' he said . `` Our connection to voters on economics has been slipping , and we have to address that . ''\nObama told Americans they essentially have a choice between a nation where all have a chance to improve their lot in life , or one where prosperity is achieved by just a few .\nWith national unemployment at 6.7 percent \u2014 down 1.1 percentage points since Obama took office in January 2009 \u2014 the economy remains the top issue for most voters and Democrats see economic fairness as a winning message .\n`` Opportunity is who we are , '' Obama said . `` And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise . ''\nIn his call for an increase in the minimum wage , Obama pointed to polling that shows support for a boost and sold it as an economic development tool \u2014 and a campaign mantra .\n`` This will help families , '' he said . `` It will give businesses customers with more money to spend . It does not involve any new bureaucratic program . So join the rest of the country . Say yes . Give America a raise . ''\nRepresentative Paul Ryan said Obama 's plan would backfire on workers .\n`` It 's bad economics , '' the Wisconsin Republican said on CNBC today . `` What we want is more people to enter into the workforce .

He also said he 's enlisting companies , including Apple and Verizon , to help solve issues from expanding broadband in schools to hiring the long-term unemployed .\nObama appealed for cooperation from the divided Congress on other priorities , including immigration , corporate taxes , trade , transportation , and an expansion of the earned income tax credit to aid the working poor .\nThe president 's message is designed to shore up his support among Democrats rather than winning over the independent voters who decide most elections , said Whit Ayres , a Virginia-based Republican polling consultant .\n`` It is totally a Democrat base play , '' he said . `` They are going back to a timeless class-warfare play to try to distract people from Obamacare . ''\nDemocratic polling expert Geoff Garin , who worked for Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign in 2008 , countered that Obama 's message will be a strong one because Americans increasingly think it 's hard to stay in the middle class and even harder to get there .\n`` Mitt was a soft target and the reality is that those do n't come along every day , but the Republican brand is still deeply identified with favoritism with those at the top and corporate interests , '' he said . `` Democrats are much more identified as the party of the middle class .

That 's the largest proportion since the government started gathering such data in 1917 .\nThe study also found that those with the top 1 percent of incomes saw their earnings grow 31.4 percent from 2009 , when the recession ended , to 2012 .
