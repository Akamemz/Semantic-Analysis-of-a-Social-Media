    "content": "President Obama and his top aides tried to rally support Thursday for retaliatory strikes in Syria , saying they remain convinced that the Assad regime used chemical weapons , but hopes for an international coalition took a major hit when the British Parliament voted against military action .\nBritish lawmakers questioned the strength of the claims that forces loyal to President Bashar Assad used poison gas to attack rebels in a Damascus suburb last week \u2014 a skepticism that U.S. lawmakers share , amid reports that U.S. intelligence officials are uncertain who controls Syria \u2019 s stockpiles of poison gas .\nSenior officials said Mr. Obama is still considering unilateral action without his British allies , arguing that core U.S. national security interests are at stake . The White House steadfastly stood by Mr. Obama \u2019 s claim that Syria attacked its own citizens with chemical weapons , saying the evidence is \u201c very convincing . \u201d\n\u201c There is a preponderance of evidence , \u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters , though he said the administration isn \u2019 t ready to make public an unclassified report detailing that evidence .\nLate Thursday , the administration held a 90-minute conference call with 26 high-ranking members of Congress , who are on a five-week summer recess .\nRep. Eliot L.
