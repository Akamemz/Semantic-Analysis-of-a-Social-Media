These days , they settle for Saturday morning Zoom calls to reimagine what their political organizing looks like now that their preferred tools of the trade\u2014door knocking and mail drops\u2014are off the table .\nI met Kanikula and her friends in October 2018 , a high season of political activity . The group was trying to elect Democrat Lauren Underwood , then a 32-year-old nurse who \u2019 d guided the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , to Congress . The women were mostly new to politics , having dipped their toes into activism in the wake of Donald Trump \u2019 s election . They spent the 2018 cycle rebuilding Democratic infrastructure in their cluster of exurbs 50 miles west of Chicago , an area where Republicans had long ruled by default . That year , they focused their energies on ginning up excitement for a small slate of Democratic candidates . This time around , a Democrat is challenging a GOP officeholder in the county for every elected position but coroner .\nIn recent weeks , Tara Reade \u2019 s sexual assault allegations against Joe Biden have rippled through the group , setting off a flurry of notifications in their text chain with each new development . Reade \u2019 s claims are \u201c disheartening , \u201d Kanikula tells me . But like the 10 other \u201c resistance women \u201d I spoke with , she \u2019 s sticking with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee regardless . \u201c If it was a different kind of election , I \u2019 d give it more weight , \u201d she says . \u201c But the No . 1 goal is to get Trump out of there . \u201d\n\u201c They have put a lot of energy into making politics be about more than just a single savior candidate . \u201d\nKanikula and her friends seem yanked from research conducted by Harvard sociologist Theda Skopcol and University of Pittsburgh historian Lara Putnam in the wake of the 2016 election . The scholars had identified a new brand of Democratic activist : white , college-educated women who live in suburban and exurban communities where \u201c country club Republicans \u201d had long reigned . In the wake of Trump \u2019 s victory , these women flocked to their nearest city for the Women \u2019 s March , formed Indivisible groups , and , eventually , worked with their local Democratic parties to unseat Republicans at every level of government .\nThis is not the usual picture of the resurgent activist left . Many accounts of the suburban woman \u2019 s political awakening are fond of anathematizing these activists as \u201c wine moms \u201d or \u201c MSNBC moms \u201d or the \u201c yoga vote. \u201d The Resistance was the new brunch , the new book club . For proof this was wrong one need only look at the 2018 midterms , when suburban women around the country\u2014 \u201c retired teachers , librarians , health care people , some businesswomen , \u201d as Skocpol put it\u2014helped power the Blue Wave that swept Democrats into control of the House . Health care was at the heart of their organizing efforts , a big reason it \u2019 s at the heart of the Democratic agenda today . This cycle , Biden not only needs these women to vote\u2014he \u2019 s relying on them to keep Democratic enthusiasm alive in their communities through November . The campaign \u2019 s online strategy is shaped around appealing to what its digital director recently called , not a little cringingly , the \u201c suburban Facebook empathy moms . \u201d\nThese activists had been forged in no small part by Trump \u2019 s chronic degradation of women ; as it stands , roughly two dozen have accused him of sexual assault . But as an allegation concerning their party \u2019 s presidential candidate captures national headlines , the women I spoke with remain committed to their political activism . That \u2019 s not because they believe Biden\u2014though many do . It \u2019 s because their ultimate goal is limiting Trump to one term . If that requires some compromises along the way , so be it .\n\u201c Do they think that sexual assault is okay ? No , \u201d Putnam says . \u201c Do they think that being a woman involved in politics , where there are still lots of male politicians , means a lot of compromises all the time in order to get things done ? Yes . \u201d\nReade \u2019 s claims against Biden have taken a muddled route to the national spotlight . In April 2019 , Reade came forward to claim the former vice president had touched her neck and shoulders inappropriately when she had been an aide in his Senate office in the early 1990s ; that claim had been corroborated by several of her contemporaries and more than half a dozen women who \u2019 d made similar allegations .\nBut this spring , Reade leveled a more serious accusation at the former vice president : that he had shoved her against the wall of a Senate office building , reached under her skirt , and digitally penetrated her.Biden outright denies these claims . Reporters , lacking the copious documentation or clear pattern of predation on which much of # MeToo reporting is built , have thus far been unable to move the story onto the sturdier footing . The circumstances are best summarized by Vox \u2019 s Laura McGann , who spent more than a year investigating Reade \u2019 s allegations : \u201c None of this means Reade is lying , but it leaves us in a limbo of Me Too : a story that may be true but that we can \u2019 t prove . \u201d\nA new Monmouth poll found that only 20 percent of Democrats think Reade is telling the truth , a sentiment mirrored by the activists I spoke with who say many are still processing the allegations . \u201c I don \u2019 t think anyone \u2019 s rushing to judgment now , \u201d Kierstyn Zolfo , the Pennsylvania statewide legislative chair for Indivisible , tells me . Barb Kaplan , who leads an Indivisible group in the Cleveland suburbs , says fellow activists she \u2019 s spoken with \u201c want to see some hard evidence , \u201d adding that \u201c most see it as a distraction . \u201d\nBut Putnam suggests another force is at work , and she points to the presidential primary as evidence . Biden had never been these activists \u2019 favorite candidate\u2014most of them preferred Elizabeth Warren or one of the other two dozen Democrats who sought the presidency this cycle . But these women got into politics , Putnam explains , with a vision of building Democratic political power above all else . Just as choosing one candidate over another is antithetical to their mission , so too would be calling for the removal of a candidate who most Democrats think did nothing wrong .\n\u201c They have put a lot of energy into making politics be about more than just a single savior candidate\u2014whether that \u2019 s a candidate who they really loved or really disliked , \u201d Putnam says . \u201c They have been girding themselves for living with an outcome they knew they were not going to be personally excited about at the top of the ticket . \u201d\n\u201c Coming out of 2016 , most people have been unified in driving Trump out of the White House , \u201d Kaplan says . \u201c It \u2019 s going to be really hard to dissuade them from that position . \u201d\nThis shouldn \u2019 t be mistaken for blind party loyalty\u2014indeed , a number of these activists , some of them former Republicans , identify as independents . Nor are these women turning a blind eye to the claims . In fact , quite the opposite : For many , Biden \u2019 s history of behavior toward women has already been factored into their dim view of the candidate . Besides the allegations raised last spring , many activists\u2014in particular , the older , professional women who make of up the bulk of the cohort\u2014haven \u2019 t forgiven Biden for the way he treated Anita Hill , the law professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment . As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Biden presided over Thomas \u2019 confirmation hearing and failed to seriously investigate Hill \u2019 s accusations or call corroborating witnesses to testify against Thomas . Last year , Hill accused Biden of having \u201c set the stage \u201d for Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s Supreme Court confirmation in 2018 , when claims of sexual misconduct made against the judge were also poorly handled .\nSuch realpolitik can seem at odds with the revulsion that pushed many of the activists into politics in the first place . But to hear Lark Cowart tell it , that moral energy hasn \u2019 t dissipated ; it was merely channeled elsewhere once the women \u2019 s preferred candidates began to exit the presidential race . \u201c When you lose your grand motivation , you \u2019 re finding other races and things to focus on , \u201d says Cowart , a member of the Kane County group . \u201c I \u2019 ll pour my energies behind the women who are running . \u201d\nMelissa Rodriguez , who runs an Indivisible group near Dayton , Ohio , said her members had come to a similar agreement when Biden became the nominee . \u201c If you want to spend your energy on a local race or voter registration , go for it , \u201d she recalls saying . \u201c We \u2019 re just pushing toward a great Democratic turnout . \u201d\nThe suburbs helped deliver the Democratic nomination to Biden , and he \u2019 ll rely on them to unseat Trump come November .

In the midst of the pandemic , paid family leave , health care , and related domestic issues are top of mind for swing voters .
