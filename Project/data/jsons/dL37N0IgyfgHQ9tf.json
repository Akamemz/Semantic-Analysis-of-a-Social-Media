He has previously written for the New Republic and Slate , and is author of The Great Divergence : America \u2019 s Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It ( Bloomsbury , 2012 ) .\nYou could shout yourself hoarse arguing what the just-begun 2016 general election is about . The insider versus the outsider ! No , feminism versus machismo ! No , \u201c Stronger together \u201d versus \u201c I alone can fix it \u201d !\nOne thing that 2016 really isn \u2019 t about is newness . Neither candidate is anybody \u2019 s idea of a fresh face . Hillary Clinton will be 69 on Inauguration Day , Donald Trump , 70 . Each entered this race a celebrity minted in a distant epoch from which neither candidate can fully escape .\nWhat \u2019 s the 2016 election really about ? The Eighties are running against the Nineties .\nThe 1980s and 1990s remain who Trump and Clinton , respectively , are\u2014or at least how they seem most of the time . The 1980s was the decade when Trump emerged as a local symbol of New York City \u2019 s brash new wealth and parlayed that into national fame . His taste for Italian marble and gold-plated fixtures perfectly matched a period that extolled conspicuous displays of personal wealth . For Clinton , the 1990s , a decade dominated by technology-driven prosperity , affirmed her conviction that brainpower and idealism could overcome bitter political divisions . She entered the White House as a full partner in a duo bent on seizing a political center evaporating faster than liquid helium . ( \u201c Two for the price of one , \u201d husband Bill promised . )\nEven in a tumultuous and norm-defying campaign , Clinton and Trump have held fast to the identities they crafted in their formative decades . Clinton is identified permanently with her husband \u2019 s \u201c third way \u201d triangulation of the 1990s , even as she \u2019 s drifted leftward on issues like trade and the minimum wage . It was simply what she had to do to defeat her democratic socialist primary opponent , Bernie Sanders , and to keep up with her party \u2019 s new focus on income inequality . Trump is regarded permanently as the real estate titan he was in the 1980s even though his business model later shifted toward licensing the Trump name ( always in gold , always in caps ) to properties he didn \u2019 t own . Few realize that even Trump \u2019 s renovation of Washington \u2019 s Old Post Office\u2014currently his highest-profile building project\u2014is a leasing deal ; the title is held by the federal government . Even the dire tone of Trump \u2019 s nomination speech , in which he declared that we live in an era \u201c more dangerous than , frankly , I have ever seen , \u201d was a far better description of the soaring crime he lived through in the late \u2019 80s in New York than of today . ( Trump himself was channeling Richard Nixon in 1968 , but the \u2019 80s were all about slamming shut the Pandora \u2019 s box that was the \u2019 60s . )\nEven in a tumultuous and norm-defying campaign , Clinton and Trump have held fast to the identities they crafted in their formative decades .\nTruthfully , the two candidates don \u2019 t work very hard to update their images because the decades that hatched them represent golden ages to which they promise America will return .\nTrump \u2019 s very slogan , \u201c Make America Great Again , \u201d is borrowed from Ronald Reagan \u2019 s presidential campaign of 1980 ( \u201c Let \u2019 s Make America Great Again \u201d ) . It \u2019 s a straightforward appeal to GOP nostalgia for a decade of conservative ascendancy , economic prosperity and a president whom Republicans idealize . Asked in January what \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d meant , Trump said , \u201c I think during the Ronald Reagan years we were very good . ... We felt good about our country . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s New Jerusalem , meanwhile , looks very much like the 1990s . Hillary \u2019 s new \u201c Change-Maker \u201d slogan is an echo of Bill \u2019 s rallying cry at the 1992 convention : \u201c It \u2019 s time to change America. \u201d In May , Hillary said she would put Bill \u201c in charge of revitalizing the economy , \u201d a role that would make him the most powerful first relative since Robert F. Kennedy . The politics are a bit tricky . Hillary knows that Democrats feel ambivalent about resurrecting a public figure whom opponents once branded \u201c Slick Willie. \u201d But she also knows that nobody is ambivalent about the eight-year economic expansion that Bill Clinton presided over during his presidency . \u201c You know , at the end of the \u2019 90s , \u201d Hillary said in March , \u201c we had 23 million new jobs . Incomes went up for everybody. \u201d Elect me , Hillary was saying , and we \u2019 ll make it happen again .\nIn theory , one party ( call them the Ins ) always stands for continuity while the other ( the Outs ) always stands for change .\nAs a Republican , Trump is obliged to disparage Obama . Trump sees the Obama presidency as a \u201c total disaster , \u201d to quote a phrase he \u2019 s used to describe the Affordable Care Act and Obama \u2019 s foreign policy . But Trump \u2019 s disparagement doesn \u2019 t stop there . He uses the same phrase to describe fellow Republican George W. Bush \u2019 s conduct of the Iraq war and Bill Clinton \u2019 s signing of NAFTA . That takes the 21st century off the table and also the final decade of the 20th . To avoid \u201c total disaster , \u201d Trump \u2019 s followers must travel in time back to \u2026 you guessed it , the 1980s .\nClinton speaks favorably of Obama , as she must ; he \u2019 s her party \u2019 s incumbent , and she spent four years as his secretary of state . But she tends to describe Obama \u2019 s administration as a mere continuation of her husband \u2019 s ( interrupted by a George W. Bush presidency that \u201c wrecked the economy \u201d ) . The Affordable Care Act , for instance , \u201c was called Hillarycare , \u201d Hillary said in January , \u201c before it was called Obamacare. \u201d That \u2019 s a stretch\u2014Obamacare resembles Hillarycare only in the very broad sense that both were ambitious health reform plans proposed by Democrats . But in Clinton \u2019 s telling , the biggest policy accomplishment of the Obama administration\u2014really , the biggest policy accomplishment of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson\u2014was rooted in the glorious 1990s .\nMuch as they might focus on up-to-date topics like ISIL and cyberwar , Trump and Clinton are vying for control of the political Wayback Machine , and the only difference is where they want to set the dial . Want to know what they \u2019 re likely to do in office ? Just take a look at the signature themes\u2014war , economy and good old family values\u2014that define the eras that they epitomize .\nBroadly speaking , the 1980s was a decade of peace and the 1990s a decade of war .\nThat confounds political stereotypes because Ronald Reagan was a bit of a saber rattler . \u201c I 've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever , \u201d Reagan famously quipped in 1984 , not knowing the microphone in front of him was hot . \u201c We begin bombing in five minutes. \u201d Reagan presided over a vast arms buildup , including a wildly ambitious anti-nuke umbrella in outer space that critics dubbed \u201c Star Wars. \u201d Some historians credit this arms buildup with winning the Cold War simply because the Soviets couldn \u2019 t keep up . Reagan also aided proxy wars in Nicaragua , Afghanistan and elsewhere .\nBut where American soldiers were concerned Reagan was extremely risk-averse , withdrawing them , for instance , from a multinational peacekeeping mission in Beirut in 1983 after the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah killed 241 Americans . Reagan later sent thousands of TOW missiles secretly to Iran in exchange for the release of ( what turned out to be ) five of the seven hostages held by that same Hezbollah . As president , Reagan sent U.S. troops into battle only once , for a grand total of three days in 1983 , to wrest the tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada from a Marxist coup . The liberal commentator Michael Kinsley called it a \u201c test-tube war . \u201d\nThe real wars happened in the 1990s . The largest deployment was 1991 \u2019 s Persian Gulf War , wherein U.S. forces chased Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait ( but not out of Iraq ) . The Gulf War was a 1990s event but not a Clinton administration event ; it was waged by George H.W . Bush , and it rekindled , however briefly , Americans \u2019 faith in full-scale military intervention after their Vietnam debacle . ( \u201c Good night , Vietnam , \u201d reporter David Shribman quipped in the Wall Street Journal ) . Bush also committed troops to support relief efforts in Somalia , where civil war was raging . Clinton escalated that deployment and then withdrew the troops as the country descended into anarchy . Later in the \u2019 90s Clinton ordered airstrikes to quell ethnic strife in Bosnia and Kosovo , and also twice in Iraq to counter assorted misbehavior by Saddam .\nTrump \u2019 s foreign policy stance is an exaggerated version of Reagan \u2019 s : Talk tough and go out of your way to avoid military interventions .\nExcept for Somalia , all these military operations were on balance successful , and all of them , including Somalia , were short term . In both respects , they were vastly different from U.S. deployments over the following two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nTrump is much fonder of Russia than Reagan was ( to put it mildly ) , but otherwise his foreign policy stance is an exaggerated version of Reagan \u2019 s : Talk tough ( \u201c I \u2019 m gon na build a military that \u2019 s gon na be much stronger than it is right now , \u201d Trump has said . ) and go out of your way to avoid military interventions . Did Reagan provoke the Soviet Union by calling it ( however accurately ) an \u201c evil empire \u201d ? Trump sees and raises by endorsing torture ( \u201c We have to beat the savages. \u201d ) . Although at the time , Trump favored the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2011 U.S. intervention in Libya , just as Clinton did , he now says he opposed them . Clinton , meanwhile , is more measured in her rhetoric but favors a more hawkish foreign policy that \u2019 s closer to the 1990s policies of George H.W . Bush and her husband . As secretary of state , for instance , she favored U.S. training for Syrian rebels , only to be overruled by Obama .\nThe 1980s was a decade in which the budget deficit spun out of control . The 1990s was a decade in which the deficit , however briefly , disappeared .\nHere again we see Republicans and Democrats playing against type . \u201c For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit , \u201d Reagan said in his 1981 inaugural address , \u201c mortgaging our future and our children 's future for the temporary convenience of the present. \u201d When he spoke these words , the budget deficit was $ 74 billion . By the time Reagan left office it was $ 155 billion . ( Currently the deficit is $ 401 billion , a higher absolute figure but a smaller percentage of gross domestic product than in Reagan \u2019 s final year . ) Much of the blame lies with tax cuts that failed to deliver the revenue boost predicted by the supply-side economic priesthood . But federal spending increased during Reagan \u2019 s presidency , too , by about 80 percent , much of it the aforementioned military buildup .\nThe deficit continued to climb during George H.W . Bush \u2019 s presidency , but under Bill Clinton it fell from $ 290 billion , to zero , to a surplus of $ 236 billion in Clinton \u2019 s final year . Tax increases passed by Clinton and by Bush ( in violation of the latter \u2019 s \u201c no new taxes \u201d pledge ) helped bring deficits under control , but Clinton also slowed spending growth . During Clinton \u2019 s presidency , federal spending increased by 29 percent\u2014less than half the rate of increase under Reagan and slightly slower than Obama \u2019 s estimated 32 percent .\nIf your preferred measure of governmental bloat is the number of people who work for the federal government , that grew under Reagan by about 7 percent and shrank under Bill Clinton by about 16 percent ( continuing , once again , a trend that began under George H.W . Bush ) . Much of that had to do with the end of the Cold War , but under Clinton even the number of civilian workers shrank ( by about 13 percent ) , compared to growth of about 4 percent under Reagan , the very same president who famously declared his nine most terrifying words were \u201c I \u2019 m from the government and I \u2019 m here to help. \u201d ( Both civilian and military federal employment shrank under Obama through 2014 , the most recent year for which data are available . )\nTrump makes less effort than Reagan did to disguise his hedonistic impulse toward deficit spending .\nMost government expansion over the past few decades , it should be noted , has occurred through contractors . Nobody , alas , seems to know how many contract employees that entailed , but it \u2019 s a good bet their ranks grew through both the 1980s and the 1990s . According to the Congressional Budget Office , federal contract spending today is somewhere in excess of $ 500 billion . Most of that spending is by the Defense Department , which today , remarkably , hands most of its annual budget over to the private sector .\nAs with matters of war and peace , Trump \u2019 s stance resembles Reagan \u2019 s , with the difference that Trump makes less effort than Reagan did to disguise his hedonistic impulse toward deficit spending . \u201c You have tremendous waste , fraud and abuse , \u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal in February , invoking a trinity frequently mentioned by Reagan in the 1980s . But the specific example Trump gave\u2014phantom Social Security payments to nonexistent people aged 106 years and older\u2014garbled an inspector general report that actually said very few such payments were made . In general , Trump distinguished himself from his primary opponents by pledging not to cut entitlement spending even as he proposed tax cuts that the bipartisan Committee For A Responsible Federal Budget estimated would expand the national debt by $ 12 trillion .\nHillary \u2019 s orientation is very much like Bill \u2019 s was in the 1990s\u2014she does not espouse entitlement cuts ( Democrats seldom do ) but would likely accept them as part of a bipartisan budget deal that also raised taxes ( though she \u2019 s never said so ) . Clinton has proposed new government spending that might add up to as much as $ 1 trillion , but her proposed tax increases would raise about the same amount , according to the left-leaning Tax Policy Center . On paper , then , Trump would expand the deficit , as Reagan did in the 1980s , while Clinton would neither expand nor shrink it , falling short of what Bill achieved in the 1990s .\nThe 1980s celebrated family values . The 1990s fretted about them .\nRonald Reagan was the first ( and still the only ) divorced person ever to be elected president . But even his bitterest enemies didn \u2019 t question Reagan \u2019 s devotion to his wife Nancy . Some did think , though , this devotion verged on dependence : He called her \u201c mommy , \u201d and once , in 1984 , she got caught on tape feeding him a response to a reporter \u2019 s question ( \u201c We \u2019 re doing everything we can. \u201d ) . The Reagans \u2019 daughter , Patti Davis , thought her parents \u2019 devotion to each other \u201c meant that they were complete \u201d without their children . \u201c If a band of gypsies came and took me and [ Ron Reagan Jr. ] away , \u201d Patti said earlier this year on NBC \u2019 s Today , \u201c they would miss us , but they \u2019 d be fine. \u201d After Reagan \u2019 s first grandchild was born , it was noted widely that the sitting president took two years to see him .\nReagan avoided the subject of gay rights , even though , as a former actor , he had many gay friends ( prompting the liberal commentator Hendrik Hertzberg to dub him a \u201c closet tolerant \u201d ) . Reagan didn \u2019 t mention AIDS publicly until 1985 , and when the topic came up at news briefings it prompted snickers . The topic of gay marriage lay far enough in the future as to be a non-issue ; as late as 1989 , mainstream culture judged it an entirely novel idea when the conservative writer Andrew Sullivan published his first essay on the topic . On abortion , Reagan was a sharp critic , even going so far as to write an election-year book in 1984 titled Abortion And The Conscience of A Nation . Through the 1980s , teenage birth rates , teenage pregnancy rates and teenage abortion rates stayed about level .\nIn the 1990s , Bill Clinton showed himself to be a more doting father than Reagan\u2014we learned last week he binge-watched all six Police Academy movies with Chelsea\u2014but a less doting husband . Evidence of the latter trickled in during the 1992 primaries ( prompting a Clinton campaign aide to coin the phrase \u201c bimbo eruptions \u201d ) and turned into a flood in 1998 , when an independent counsel hired to investigate a fishy-looking real estate deal decided instead to pursue Bill \u2019 s commitment to ( and veracity under oath concerning ) his marriage vows .\nIn the 1990s , Bill Clinton showed himself to be a more doting father than Reagan , but a less doting husband .\nThe 1990s were the decade when the phrase \u201c culture wars \u201d came into vogue ( thanks largely to the 1991 book Culture Wars : The Struggle To Define America by University of Virginia sociologist James Davison Hunter ) . On gay rights , Bill immediately pledged to end a ban on gays serving in the military . That prompted a political furor that ended with the implementation of an unworkable policy called \u201c Don \u2019 t Ask , Don \u2019 t Tell \u201d that limped along until 2011 . Bill was much more cautious on gay marriage , favoring civil unions but signing into law a nationwide ban on gay marriage that the Supreme Court eventually struck down ( by then with Bill \u2019 s approval ) in 2013 . On abortion , the Clinton administration \u2019 s policy was that it be \u201c safe , legal , and rare , \u201d a verbal construction that captures the somewhat anguished tenor of the times . In spite of that anguish , many of the social trends that inspired the greatest anxiety were in retreat . Throughout the 1990s ( once again , starting under George H.W . Bush and continuing under Clinton ) birth rates , pregnancy rates and abortion rates among teenagers declined . Indeed , trajectories for hot-button social issues grew so favorable that by decade \u2019 s end William Bennett , a former Education secretary under George H.W . Bush , had to stop publishing an annual jeremiad he called the \u201c Index of Leading Cultural Indicators . \u201d\nTrump , like Reagan , is in his personal life a ( somewhat-less-closeted ) tolerant : a twice-divorced man who during his first marriage began an affair with the woman who would become his second wife . Unlike Reagan , though , Trump lacks gallantry ; he once boasted in writing that \u201c If I told the real stories of my experiences with women , often seemingly very happily married and important women , this book would be a guaranteed best-seller. \u201d On social issues , Trump hews closer to Hillary Clinton than to his fellow Republicans , opposing , for instance , North Carolina \u2019 s ban on transgender bathrooms . But Trump \u2019 s attitudes on gay and transgender rights have been somewhat conflicted over the decades . He shunned his longtime mentor and lawyer Roy Cohn in 1985 when he discovered Cohn had AIDS , which he would die of in 1986 . On the one hand , in Trump \u2019 s nomination speech he diverged from his text to congratulate the crowd for cheering his pledge to \u201c protect LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. \u201d On the other hand , Trump draws the line at gay marriage and abortion , both of which he now opposes . Hillary Clinton favors gay marriage and is pro-choice .\nOne could go on . Violent crime rose in the 1980s and fell in the 1990s , for reasons that experts still argue about . Income inequality grew during both decades , though only during the 1990s did economic expansion increase median income in any significant way . ( Important caveat : The much-despised 1 percent expanded its share of the nation \u2019 s collective income faster under Clinton than under Reagan . ) The stock market crashed in 1987 and sort-of crashed in 1998 , in neither instance prompting a recession . Personal computers became a consumer item in the 1980s but were able to do much more in the 1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web . Brood X , the only cicada cycle worth worrying about , blanketed the sidewalks with crunchy carcasses in 1987 but didn \u2019 t reappear until 2004 , bypassing the \u2019 90s entirely .\nShould the 1980s get your vote , or the 1990s ? That \u2019 s a personal choice\u2014more personal perhaps , and certainly more nuanced , than the choice between two actual human beings who are running for president . Both candidates want to build a bridge back to the 20th century . The question voters must decide is : which part ?\nCORRECTION : An earlier version of this article stated , incorrectly , that federal contract spending is somewhere in excess of $ 500 million . The correct figure is $ 500 billion .",

Each entered this race a celebrity minted in a distant epoch from which neither candidate can fully escape.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat\u2019s the 2016 election really about? The Eighties are running against the Nineties.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s remain who Trump and Clinton, respectively, are\u2014or at least how they seem most of the time. The 1980s was the decade when Trump emerged as a local symbol of New York City\u2019s brash new wealth and parlayed that into national fame. His taste for Italian marble and gold-plated fixtures perfectly matched a period that extolled conspicuous displays of personal wealth. For Clinton, the 1990s, a decade dominated by technology-driven prosperity, affirmed her conviction that brainpower and idealism could overcome bitter political divisions. She entered the White House as a full partner in a duo bent on seizing a political center evaporating faster than liquid helium. (\u201cTwo for the price of one,\u201d husband Bill promised.)\n\nEven in a tumultuous and norm-defying campaign, Clinton and Trump have held fast to the identities they crafted in their formative decades. Clinton is identified permanently with her husband\u2019s \u201cthird way\u201d triangulation of the 1990s, even as she\u2019s drifted leftward on issues like trade and the minimum wage. It was simply what she had to do to defeat her democratic socialist primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, and to keep up with her party\u2019s new focus on income inequality. Trump is regarded permanently as the real estate titan he was in the 1980s even though his business model later shifted toward licensing the Trump name (always in gold, always in caps) to properties he didn\u2019t own. Few realize that even Trump\u2019s renovation of Washington\u2019s Old Post Office\u2014currently his highest-profile building project\u2014is a leasing deal; the title is held by the federal government. Even the dire tone of Trump\u2019s nomination speech, in which he declared that we live in an era \u201cmore dangerous than, frankly, I have ever seen,\u201d was a far better description of the soaring crime he lived through in the late \u201980s in New York than of today. (Trump himself was channeling Richard Nixon in 1968, but the \u201980s were all about slamming shut the Pandora\u2019s box that was the \u201960s.)\n\nEven in a tumultuous and norm-defying campaign, Clinton and Trump have held fast to the identities they crafted in their formative decades.\n\nTruthfully, the two candidates don\u2019t work very hard to update their images because the decades that hatched them represent golden ages to which they promise America will return.\n\nTrump\u2019s very slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d is borrowed from Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential campaign of 1980 (\u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again\u201d). It\u2019s a straightforward appeal to GOP nostalgia for a decade of conservative ascendancy, economic prosperity and a president whom Republicans idealize. Asked in January what \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d meant, Trump said, \u201cI think during the Ronald Reagan years we were very good. ... We felt good about our country.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s New Jerusalem, meanwhile, looks very much like the 1990s. Hillary\u2019s new \u201cChange-Maker\u201d slogan is an echo of Bill\u2019s rallying cry at the 1992 convention: \u201cIt\u2019s time to change America.\u201d In May, Hillary said she would put Bill \u201cin charge of revitalizing the economy,\u201d a role that would make him the most powerful first relative since Robert F. Kennedy. The politics are a bit tricky. Hillary knows that Democrats feel ambivalent about resurrecting a public figure whom opponents once branded \u201cSlick Willie.\u201d But she also knows that nobody is ambivalent about the eight-year economic expansion that Bill Clinton presided over during his presidency. \u201cYou know, at the end of the \u201990s,\u201d Hillary said in March, \u201cwe had 23 million new jobs. Incomes went up for everybody.\u201d Elect me, Hillary was saying, and we\u2019ll make it happen again.\n\nIn theory, one party (call them the Ins) always stands for continuity while the other (the Outs) always stands for change.\n\nAs a Republican, Trump is obliged to disparage Obama. Trump sees the Obama presidency as a \u201ctotal disaster,\u201d to quote a phrase he\u2019s used to describe the Affordable Care Act and Obama\u2019s foreign policy. But Trump\u2019s disparagement doesn\u2019t stop there. He uses the same phrase to describe fellow Republican George W. Bush\u2019s conduct of the Iraq war and Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of NAFTA. That takes the 21st century off the table and also the final decade of the 20th. To avoid \u201ctotal disaster,\u201d Trump\u2019s followers must travel in time back to \u2026 you guessed it, the 1980s.\n\nClinton speaks favorably of Obama, as she must; he\u2019s her party\u2019s incumbent, and she spent four years as his secretary of state. But she tends to describe Obama\u2019s administration as a mere continuation of her husband\u2019s (interrupted by a George W. Bush presidency that \u201cwrecked the economy\u201d). The Affordable Care Act, for instance, \u201cwas called Hillarycare,\u201d Hillary said in January, \u201cbefore it was called Obamacare.\u201d That\u2019s a stretch\u2014Obamacare resembles Hillarycare only in the very broad sense that both were ambitious health reform plans proposed by Democrats. But in Clinton\u2019s telling, the biggest policy accomplishment of the Obama administration\u2014really, the biggest policy accomplishment of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson\u2014was rooted in the glorious 1990s.\n\nMuch as they might focus on up-to-date topics like ISIL and cyberwar, Trump and Clinton are vying for control of the political Wayback Machine, and the only difference is where they want to set the dial. Want to know what they\u2019re likely to do in office? Just take a look at the signature themes\u2014war, economy and good old family values\u2014that define the eras that they epitomize.\n\n***\n\nBroadly speaking, the 1980s was a decade of peace and the 1990s a decade of war.\n\nThat confounds political stereotypes because Ronald Reagan was a bit of a saber rattler. \u201cI've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever,\u201d Reagan famously quipped in 1984, not knowing the microphone in front of him was hot. \u201cWe begin bombing in five minutes.\u201d Reagan presided over a vast arms buildup, including a wildly ambitious anti-nuke umbrella in outer space that critics dubbed \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Some historians credit this arms buildup with winning the Cold War simply because the Soviets couldn\u2019t keep up. Reagan also aided proxy wars in Nicaragua, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nBut where American soldiers were concerned Reagan was extremely risk-averse, withdrawing them, for instance, from a multinational peacekeeping mission in Beirut in 1983 after the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks by the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah killed 241 Americans. Reagan later sent thousands of TOW missiles secretly to Iran in exchange for the release of (what turned out to be) five of the seven hostages held by that same Hezbollah. As president, Reagan sent U.S. troops into battle only once, for a grand total of three days in 1983, to wrest the tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada from a Marxist coup. The liberal commentator Michael Kinsley called it a \u201ctest-tube war.\u201d\n\nThe real wars happened in the 1990s. The largest deployment was 1991\u2019s Persian Gulf War, wherein U.S. forces chased Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait (but not out of Iraq). The Gulf War was a 1990s event but not a Clinton administration event; it was waged by George H.W. Bush, and it rekindled, however briefly, Americans\u2019 faith in full-scale military intervention after their Vietnam debacle. (\u201cGood night, Vietnam,\u201d reporter David Shribman quipped in the Wall Street Journal). Bush also committed troops to support relief efforts in Somalia, where civil war was raging. Clinton escalated that deployment and then withdrew the troops as the country descended into anarchy. Later in the \u201990s Clinton ordered airstrikes to quell ethnic strife in Bosnia and Kosovo, and also twice in Iraq to counter assorted misbehavior by Saddam.\n\nTrump\u2019s foreign policy stance is an exaggerated version of Reagan\u2019s: Talk tough and go out of your way to avoid military interventions.\n\nExcept for Somalia, all these military operations were on balance successful, and all of them, including Somalia, were short term. In both respects, they were vastly different from U.S. deployments over the following two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nTrump is much fonder of Russia than Reagan was (to put it mildly), but otherwise his foreign policy stance is an exaggerated version of Reagan\u2019s: Talk tough (\u201cI\u2019m gonna build a military that\u2019s gonna be much stronger than it is right now,\u201d Trump has said.) and go out of your way to avoid military interventions. Did Reagan provoke the Soviet Union by calling it (however accurately) an \u201cevil empire\u201d? Trump sees and raises by endorsing torture (\u201cWe have to beat the savages.\u201d). Although at the time, Trump favored the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2011 U.S. intervention in Libya, just as Clinton did, he now says he opposed them. Clinton, meanwhile, is more measured in her rhetoric but favors a more hawkish foreign policy that\u2019s closer to the 1990s policies of George H.W. Bush and her husband. As secretary of state, for instance, she favored U.S. training for Syrian rebels, only to be overruled by Obama.\n\n***\n\nThe 1980s was a decade in which the budget deficit spun out of control. The 1990s was a decade in which the deficit, however briefly, disappeared.\n\nHere again we see Republicans and Democrats playing against type. \u201cFor decades we have piled deficit upon deficit,\u201d Reagan said in his 1981 inaugural address, \u201cmortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present.\u201d When he spoke these words, the budget deficit was $74 billion. By the time Reagan left office it was $155 billion. (Currently the deficit is $401 billion, a higher absolute figure but a smaller percentage of gross domestic product than in Reagan\u2019s final year.) Much of the blame lies with tax cuts that failed to deliver the revenue boost predicted by the supply-side economic priesthood. But federal spending increased during Reagan\u2019s presidency, too, by about 80 percent, much of it the aforementioned military buildup.\n\nThe deficit continued to climb during George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidency, but under Bill Clinton it fell from $290 billion, to zero, to a surplus of $236 billion in Clinton\u2019s final year. Tax increases passed by Clinton and by Bush (in violation of the latter\u2019s \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge) helped bring deficits under control, but Clinton also slowed spending growth. During Clinton\u2019s presidency, federal spending increased by 29 percent\u2014less than half the rate of increase under Reagan and slightly slower than Obama\u2019s estimated 32 percent.\n\nIf your preferred measure of governmental bloat is the number of people who work for the federal government, that grew under Reagan by about 7 percent and shrank under Bill Clinton by about 16 percent (continuing, once again, a trend that began under George H.W. Bush). Much of that had to do with the end of the Cold War, but under Clinton even the number of civilian workers shrank (by about 13 percent), compared to growth of about 4 percent under Reagan, the very same president who famously declared his nine most terrifying words were \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d (Both civilian and military federal employment shrank under Obama through 2014, the most recent year for which data are available.)\n\nTrump makes less effort than Reagan did to disguise his hedonistic impulse toward deficit spending.\n\nMost government expansion over the past few decades, it should be noted, has occurred through contractors. Nobody, alas, seems to know how many contract employees that entailed, but it\u2019s a good bet their ranks grew through both the 1980s and the 1990s. According to the Congressional Budget Office, federal contract spending today is somewhere in excess of $500 billion. Most of that spending is by the Defense Department, which today, remarkably, hands most of its annual budget over to the private sector.\n\nAs with matters of war and peace, Trump\u2019s stance resembles Reagan\u2019s, with the difference that Trump makes less effort than Reagan did to disguise his hedonistic impulse toward deficit spending. \u201cYou have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Trump told the Wall Street Journal in February, invoking a trinity frequently mentioned by Reagan in the 1980s. But the specific example Trump gave\u2014phantom Social Security payments to nonexistent people aged 106 years and older\u2014garbled an inspector general report that actually said very few such payments were made. In general, Trump distinguished himself from his primary opponents by pledging not to cut entitlement spending even as he proposed tax cuts that the bipartisan Committee For A Responsible Federal Budget estimated would expand the national debt by $12 trillion.\n\nHillary\u2019s orientation is very much like Bill\u2019s was in the 1990s\u2014she does not espouse entitlement cuts (Democrats seldom do) but would likely accept them as part of a bipartisan budget deal that also raised taxes (though she\u2019s never said so). Clinton has proposed new government spending that might add up to as much as $1 trillion, but her proposed tax increases would raise about the same amount, according to the left-leaning Tax Policy Center. On paper, then, Trump would expand the deficit, as Reagan did in the 1980s, while Clinton would neither expand nor shrink it, falling short of what Bill achieved in the 1990s.\n\n***\n\nThe 1980s celebrated family values. The 1990s fretted about them.\n\nRonald Reagan was the first (and still the only) divorced person ever to be elected president. But even his bitterest enemies didn\u2019t question Reagan\u2019s devotion to his wife Nancy. Some did think, though, this devotion verged on dependence: He called her \u201cmommy,\u201d and once, in 1984, she got caught on tape feeding him a response to a reporter\u2019s question (\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can.\u201d). The Reagans\u2019 daughter, Patti Davis, thought her parents\u2019 devotion to each other \u201cmeant that they were complete\u201d without their children. \u201cIf a band of gypsies came and took me and [Ron Reagan Jr.] away,\u201d Patti said earlier this year on NBC\u2019s Today, \u201cthey would miss us, but they\u2019d be fine.\u201d After Reagan\u2019s first grandchild was born, it was noted widely that the sitting president took two years to see him.\n\nReagan avoided the subject of gay rights, even though, as a former actor, he had many gay friends (prompting the liberal commentator Hendrik Hertzberg to dub him a \u201ccloset tolerant\u201d). Reagan didn\u2019t mention AIDS publicly until 1985, and when the topic came up at news briefings it prompted snickers. The topic of gay marriage lay far enough in the future as to be a non-issue; as late as 1989, mainstream culture judged it an entirely novel idea when the conservative writer Andrew Sullivan published his first essay on the topic. On abortion, Reagan was a sharp critic, even going so far as to write an election-year book in 1984 titled Abortion And The Conscience of A Nation. Through the 1980s, teenage birth rates, teenage pregnancy rates and teenage abortion rates stayed about level.\n\nIn the 1990s, Bill Clinton showed himself to be a more doting father than Reagan\u2014we learned last week he binge-watched all six Police Academy movies with Chelsea\u2014but a less doting husband. Evidence of the latter trickled in during the 1992 primaries (prompting a Clinton campaign aide to coin the phrase \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d) and turned into a flood in 1998, when an independent counsel hired to investigate a fishy-looking real estate deal decided instead to pursue Bill\u2019s commitment to (and veracity under oath concerning) his marriage vows.\n\nIn the 1990s, Bill Clinton showed himself to be a more doting father than Reagan, but a less doting husband.\n\nThe 1990s were the decade when the phrase \u201cculture wars\u201d came into vogue (thanks largely to the 1991 book Culture Wars: The Struggle To Define America by University of Virginia sociologist James Davison Hunter). On gay rights, Bill immediately pledged to end a ban on gays serving in the military. That prompted a political furor that ended with the implementation of an unworkable policy called \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d that limped along until 2011. Bill was much more cautious on gay marriage, favoring civil unions but signing into law a nationwide ban on gay marriage that the Supreme Court eventually struck down (by then with Bill\u2019s approval) in 2013. On abortion, the Clinton administration\u2019s policy was that it be \u201csafe, legal, and rare,\u201d a verbal construction that captures the somewhat anguished tenor of the times. In spite of that anguish, many of the social trends that inspired the greatest anxiety were in retreat. Throughout the 1990s (once again, starting under George H.W. Bush and continuing under Clinton) birth rates, pregnancy rates and abortion rates among teenagers declined. Indeed, trajectories for hot-button social issues grew so favorable that by decade\u2019s end William Bennett, a former Education secretary under George H.W. Bush, had to stop publishing an annual jeremiad he called the \u201cIndex of Leading Cultural Indicators.\u201d\n\nTrump, like Reagan, is in his personal life a (somewhat-less-closeted) tolerant: a twice-divorced man who during his first marriage began an affair with the woman who would become his second wife. Unlike Reagan, though, Trump lacks gallantry; he once boasted in writing that \u201cIf I told the real stories of my experiences with women, often seemingly very happily married and important women, this book would be a guaranteed best-seller.\u201d On social issues, Trump hews closer to Hillary Clinton than to his fellow Republicans, opposing, for instance, North Carolina\u2019s ban on transgender bathrooms. But Trump\u2019s attitudes on gay and transgender rights have been somewhat conflicted over the decades. He shunned his longtime mentor and lawyer Roy Cohn in 1985 when he discovered Cohn had AIDS, which he would die of in 1986. On the one hand, in Trump\u2019s nomination speech he diverged from his text to congratulate the crowd for cheering his pledge to \u201cprotect LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.\u201d On the other hand, Trump draws the line at gay marriage and abortion, both of which he now opposes. Hillary Clinton favors gay marriage and is pro-choice.\n\nOne could go on. Violent crime rose in the 1980s and fell in the 1990s, for reasons that experts still argue about. Income inequality grew during both decades, though only during the 1990s did economic expansion increase median income in any significant way. (Important caveat: The much-despised 1 percent expanded its share of the nation\u2019s collective income faster under Clinton than under Reagan.) The stock market crashed in 1987 and sort-of crashed in 1998, in neither instance prompting a recession. Personal computers became a consumer item in the 1980s but were able to do much more in the 1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web. Brood X, the only cicada cycle worth worrying about, blanketed the sidewalks with crunchy carcasses in 1987 but didn\u2019t reappear until 2004, bypassing the \u201990s entirely.\n\nShould the 1980s get your vote, or the 1990s? That\u2019s a personal choice\u2014more personal perhaps, and certainly more nuanced, than the choice between two actual human beings who are running for president. Both candidates want to build a bridge back to the 20th century. The question voters must decide is: which part?\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated, incorrectly, that federal contract spending is somewhere in excess of $500 million. The correct figure is $500 billion.",
