    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. increased tariffs on $ 200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 % Friday as President Trump ratcheted up pressure on Beijing and threatened to impose additional levies on virtually everything China exports to the U.S .\nThe tariff hike went into force hours after U.S. and Chinese negotiators met Thursday in hopes of getting the troubled trade talks back on track . Discussions are set to resume Friday , but the White House said it had no plans to suspend the tariff increase , which will raise levies from the current 10 % .\nChina said Friday it regretted the U.S. tariff increase and would take countermeasures , although it didn \u2019 t say what action it would take or when .\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He for a working dinner Thursday night . Afterward , Messrs. Lighthizer and Mnuchin briefed Mr. Trump on the talks , the White House said .\nEarlier Thursday , Mr. Trump told reporters the U.S. was also taking steps to impose fresh 25 % tariffs on $ 325 billion in Chinese goods that aren \u2019 t currently taxed . If that happens , virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S. would face 25 % tariffs .\n\u201c I \u2019 m different than a lot of people , \u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House . \u201c I happen to think the tariffs for our country are very powerful . \u201d\nIn a series of tweets Friday morning , he continued to back tariffs as good for the U.S. economy , while saying the U.S. would continue to negotiate but there is \u201c absolutely no need to rush. \u201d He said : \u201c Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER , not weaker . Just sit back and watch ! \u201d\nIn his tweets , Mr. Trump also suggested there could be further assistance for American farmers , in which increased tariffs collected by the U.S. would be used to buy domestic agricultural products that would then be shipped overseas in the form of humanitarian aid . Last year , the Trump administration started compensating U.S. farmers for damage tariffs were doing to their business , but many farmers said they were worried the payments wouldn \u2019 t make up for lost sales to foreign markets .\nChina has rejected U.S. claims that it has backtracked in negotiations\u2014the source of a setback this week that threatened to scuttle a potential trade agreement between the two countries\u2014and has threatened unspecified countermeasures to the new U.S. tariffs .\nShare Your Thoughts How will higher tariffs on Chinese imports affect you ? Join the conversation below .\n\u201c I came here this time , under pressure , to show China \u2019 s great sincerity , \u201d Mr. Liu said in an interview with state broadcaster CCTV after arriving in the U.S .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s tactics reflected U.S. negotiators \u2019 frustration that Beijing had reneged on earlier commitments that had been expected to produce a preliminary agreement during talks this week in Washington .\nBut the move also made clear that Mr. Trump sees tariffs as a winning tactic , both internationally with trade partners and at home with Congress .\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York , the Senate \u2019 s Democratic leader , has backed a tougher stance toward China , although he could quickly withdraw his support if Mr. Trump , a Republican , fails to reach a deal that fundamentally changes Chinese economic policy .\nThe U.S. threats acted as a backdrop to resumed negotiations between Washington and Beijing , which began with meetings between midlevel negotiators on Wednesday and continued with Mr. Liu on Thursday . Talks had progressed smoothly over recent months but nearly derailed last week .\nThe U.S. thought China had agreed to detail the laws it would change to implement the trade deal under negotiation , according to administration officials . But late last week , Beijing said it had no intention of doing so , triggering Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat Sunday to escalate tariffs and bringing the dispute into the open . U.S. negotiators viewed China as reneging on earlier commitments . From Beijing \u2019 s vantage point , the move was an effort to renegotiate U.S. demands that it believed impinged on Chinese sovereignty .\nThe negotiation setback reinforced concerns in Washington that Mr. Liu didn \u2019 t have the political strength to push commitments through the labyrinthine Chinese bureaucracy and Communist Party structure .\nMr. Liu is a longtime colleague and trusted adviser of President Xi Jinping , but he was known mainly as an academic , not a party leader . U.S. officials were quick to say Thursday that Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat to escalate tariffs wasn \u2019 t aimed at Mr. Liu , who is considered an economic reformer , but at conservative policy makers in China who prefer a tougher stance toward the U.S .\nMr. Trump had also tempered his threats by saying that Mr. Xi had written him \u201c a very beautiful letter \u201d Wednesday and that he would probably speak with Mr. Xi to see whether personal diplomacy might help .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s work together , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Let \u2019 s see if we can get something done . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t known whether Mr. Liu would be carrying instructions from Mr. Xi to offer the concessions the U.S. thinks are necessary for a deal , or would just sound out U.S. officials to better understand their intentions . Unlike in prior visits , Mr. Liu wasn \u2019 t given the title of Mr. Xi \u2019 s \u201c special envoy , \u201d suggesting he may not have the power to make significant compromises .\nThe U.S. and China have had a complicated trade relationship for the last half-century .

Beijing could sit on business-license requests by U.S. companies or withhold permission from American banks , brokerages and car makers to increase stakes in their Chinese ventures .\nIn previous rounds of retaliation , Beijing has imposed punitive duties on U.S. farm products , causing exports of U.S. soybeans , sorghum and pork to fall . A likely move now would be to raise tariffs on $ 60 billion in American goods\u2014from semiconductors to chemicals\u2014to 25 % , from the current 5 % to 10 % . That was China \u2019 s initial plan last fall to counter the U.S. duties on $ 200 billion in Chinese goods .
