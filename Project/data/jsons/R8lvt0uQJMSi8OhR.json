    "content": "California lawmakers passed a landmark bill on Wednesday that threatens to reshape how companies like Uber and Lyft do business . The legislation , known as Assembly Bill 5 ( AB5 ) , was passed in the state Assembly and now heads to Democratic California Gov . Gavin Newsom 's desk .\nShares of Lyft climbed 2.3 % on Wednesday afternoon , while Uber was up 1.4 % .\nAB5 would require gig economy workers to be reclassified as employees instead of contractors .

That 's after the bill passed in the state Senate on Tuesday .\nUber and Lyft maintain that AB5 wo n't immediately change independent contractors into employees . Tony West , Uber 's chief legal officer , said on a call with reporters that the bill builds on legal tests already established in California around how drivers should be classified . West said drivers may not necessarily fall under the new rules laid out in AB5 .\n`` Under that three-part test , arguably the highest bar is that a company must prove that contractors are doing work 'outside the usual course ' of its business , '' West said . `` Several previous rulings have found that drivers ' work is outside the usual course of Uber 's business , which is serving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces . ''\nWest said Uber intends to follow AB5 should it be put into law next year , but that it will continue to try to prove that it does n't fall under its legal framework . He warned there could be some costs to the company 's business should Uber unsuccessfully challenge AB5 .\n`` Uber is no stranger to legal battles , that 's for sure , '' West said . `` We operate in a very regulated environment , and we recognize that there will be legal challenges on all fronts much of the time . ''\nUber and Lyft have both told drivers that they may need to institute shifts if drivers are classified as employees . That would limit when ride-hailing drivers can start and stop accepting rides . In a notice to drivers , Lyft also said drivers might only be allowed to work for one ride-hailing service at a time .\n`` There would be real changes in the way that drivers interact with the platform and based on what drivers tell us , they are not changes that they would welcome , '' West said .\nHe added that he was encouraged by Gov . Newsom 's efforts around `` negotiating a solution '' on the bill . Newsom told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he 's still engaged in talks with Uber , Lyft and other gig economy companies about possible negotiations around the bill .

Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , and Kamala Harris , D-Calif. , as well as South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg .\nThe bill has the potential to change the employment status of more than 1 million low-wage workers in California , not just gig workers at companies like Uber , Lyft , DoorDash , Postmates and Instacart . It will make it harder for gig economy companies to prove that their workers are n't staff , while ensuring key benefits and protections , like minimum wage , insurance and sick days .\nAB5 has attracted staunch opposition from gig economy companies , as it could upend their traditional business model of hiring inexpensive contractors . In an effort to push back against the bill , Uber and Lyft proposed establishing a $ 21-an-hour minimum wage for drivers in California .
