    "content": "President Barack Obama has spent his two terms in office working to build closer ties with China while seeking to isolate and punish Vladimir Putin \u2019 s Russia .\nEight years later , Moscow is subject to painful US sanctions and continued public criticism from Obama and his aides . Beijing is a key economic partner that has at times served as a conduit to the rogue regime in North Korea .\nTo a large extent , that \u2019 s because the two countries have acted fairly differently in recent years . Russia \u2019 s 2014 invasion of Ukraine , 2015 bombing campaign in Syria , and 2016 hack of the US election convinced the administration that Russia was a threat to the international order \u2014 a power unwilling to play by the rules . Despite its aggressive moves in the East and South China Seas , Beijing has been far less confrontational , and far more willing to negotiate with the West in good faith on long-range issues like climate change .\nPresident-elect Donald Trump sees Putin not as a threat to Western norms but as a tough and capable leader and potential partner in fighting radical Islam . China , in his eyes , is a threat to the US economy \u2014 responsible for the loss of massive numbers of American jobs \u2014 and a country that US presidents have been far too soft on for decades . By this analysis , Russia is the potential partner , and China the potential enemy worth confronting .\n\u201c China is the biggest state adversary in Trump \u2019 s mind , \u201d Patrick Cronin , the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the left-leaning Center for a New American Security , tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It 's not Russia . It 's China . \u201d\nThe differing worldviews have been on public display in recent days . Obama used his press conference at the White House on Friday to suggest Putin was connected to his country \u2019 s cyberattacks against the US and belittled Russia . `` They are a smaller country , they are a weaker country , their economy does n't produce anything that people want to buy except for oil and gas and arms , they do n't innovate , \u201d he said . On China , he recommended respect for diplomatic tradition , cautioning against Trump \u2019 s indications that he would consider dropping Washington \u2019 s \u201c One China \u201d policy , the diplomatic understanding on the status of Taiwan that has underpinned US-Chinese relations for decades .\nTrump , by contrast , has publicly castigated the CIA for its assertion that Russia ran a sustained hacking campaign designed to boost his chances of winning the presidency . And he \u2019 s been unrepentant about his tradition-breaking phone call with the president of Taiwan and language on revisiting One China . Beijing has responded by saying that the countries would have \u201c nothing to discuss \u201d on other issues if Trump tries to deviate from One China . And after China agreed to return an unmanned US Navy drone it seized on Friday \u2014 an act that led to a striking uptick in maritime tensions between the two countries \u2014 Trump tweeted : \u201c We should tell China that we don \u2019 t want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it ! \u201d\nWhat this suggests \u2014 though , knowing Trump , we can \u2019 t be sure \u2014 is that we \u2019 re about to see a massive about-face in great power politics . Obama \u2019 s basic policy \u2014 work with China , isolate Russia \u2014 is about to be flipped on its head . The US is going to start working with Russia on a raft of issues , and start challenging China on a lot more . That could mean US policy reversals on a whole host of issues , from Syria to climate change to the US economy , with potentially major consequences for people around the world .\nChina watchers aren \u2019 t exactly sure what Trump wants out of Beijing .\nHis aggressive policies \u2014 proposing to impose a massive tariff on Chinese goods , for example \u2014 could simply be the result of instinctive hawkishness . By this interpretation , Trump sees China as a threat that will only respond to the threat of force .\nConversely , he could be trying to strike a deal with what he sees as America \u2019 s biggest rival . His aggressive policy proposals and rhetoric are opening bids designed to establish a stronger negotiation position down the line .\nAt this point , it \u2019 s impossible to tell which of these interpretations is correct . The reason is that , in either case , Trump \u2019 s opening moves would look the same : aggressive positions on areas where the US and China are at odds . And indeed , that \u2019 s what we \u2019 ve seen , with Trump openly talking about raising tariffs and considering the possibility of dropping the One China policy .\nThis means increased tensions between the US and China are inevitable , at least in the short term .\n\u201c Going back three weeks , [ Chinese officials ] were kind of guardedly optimistic , hoping that they could flatter Trump , \u201d Aaron Friedberg , a China scholar at Princeton University , says . \u201c In a way , he preemptively set the tone [ for conflict ] by doing what he \u2019 s done . \u201d\nChina appears to be responding in kind . From heated rhetoric in the official state press to the recent seizing of an underwater American drone near the Philippines , Beijing is sending signals that it won \u2019 t be pushed around .\nTrump will soon be in a position to respond . And while he hasn \u2019 t specified what he \u2019 ll do , exactly , to signal strength to China , it \u2019 s almost guaranteed that he will do something , if only to show that he \u2019 s serious about taking a hard line .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to shake this thing up , color outside the lines , challenge the orthodoxy , \u201d Cronin says , describing how he sees the Trump attitude . \u201c The risk acceptance of Trump is much higher than Obama , who was famously risk-averse in dealing with China . \u201d\nThere are all sorts of ways Trump could do this . Options , according to the experts , include :\nSelling advanced weapons to other powers in East Asia , like Vietnam\nBoosting the US military \u2019 s training mission with its Taiwanese counterparts\nEscalating direct US military operations in areas of tension , like naval patrols in the South China Sea\nFollowing through , even only partially , on the campaign threat to slap tariffs on Chinese imports\nEach of these policies carries its own risk . Military measures , like arms sales or patrols , risk provoking some kind of Chinese counter-provocation \u2014 something more dangerous than merely seizing a drone . China could justify as this as a response to US moves , thus strengthening its overall position in East Asia .\n\u201c I \u2019 m worried about our long-term position in the region , \u201d Friedberg says . \u201c One of the things that \u2019 s concerned me about the way this has gone in the past couple weeks is that I think it \u2019 s going to enable the Chinese to put blame on the United States for doing and saying destabilizing things . \u201d\nUS trade sanctions on China would directly damage the US economy , even if China doesn \u2019 t choose to respond by carrying through on its implicit threat to sell off some of the US debt it owns .\nSince we don \u2019 t fully understand the Trump administration \u2019 s thought process , we can \u2019 t be sure which of these or the many other options for hurting Beijing he \u2019 ll pick . That means we \u2019 re in a period of dangerous uncertainty on a wide variety of deeply important global issues \u2014 and , indeed , on the fundamental nature of the most important bilateral relationship in the world .\nHow making nice with Russia could make the rest of the world worse\nTrump \u2019 s well-documented affection for Moscow could also destabilize global politics . The policies that most logically follow from his overall view of Russia would upset established alliances and create incentives for Moscow to step up some of its more troubling behavior .\nThe biggest and most obvious action Trump could take to ease tensions with Russia is lifting sanctions on its economy , which , along with a plunge in global oil prices , have helped tip the Russian country into a recession since 2015 . The sanctions were slapped on Russia in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea , a peninsula on Ukraine 's Black Sea coast , and its backing of pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine .\nLifting sanctions is something that can be done with ease \u2014 a president can lift sanctions by executive order , which means it can be done without Congress . It \u2019 s also an attractive option for Trump because sanctions are a prime example of a policy that has both significant material effects and enormous symbolic value : They \u2019 ve not only put a serious strain on Russian banks and oil companies but have also been the leading contributor to contemporary anti-American sentiment in the country . So lifting sanctions is a perfect way to turn over a new leaf in US-Russian relations .\nRussia analysts say there \u2019 s a significant chance that Trump will lift sanctions shortly after taking office , but as with everything involving him , there \u2019 s always the caveat that his attitudes could change . He 's already publicly mentioned that he \u2019 ll \u201c look at \u201d lifting sanctions , and his nominee for secretary of state , Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson , criticized them in 2014 after the measures led to the collapse of a multibillion-dollar Arctic energy deal with Moscow .\nLifting sanctions won \u2019 t just provide an economic boost to Russia ; it will also implicitly endorse the country \u2019 s expansionist activities in Ukraine . Russia could in turn feel empowered to meddle in other countries with impunity . The consequences of this , much like those of Trump \u2019 s China policy shifts , are unknown \u2014 maybe they \u2019 d be nothing . But saying \u201c we \u2019 re fine with you annexing territory \u201d is certainly a dangerous signal to send to a leader as revanchist as Putin .\nThe second major opportunity for creating bridges with Russia is over the proxy war between the US and Russia in Syria . Russia \u2019 s air campaigns on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since autumn of 2015 have helped reverse the dynamics of the conflict there , putting US-backed rebels against the Assad regime on their heels . The onetime opposition stronghold of Aleppo is almost entirely under government control , and Assad \u2019 s likelihood of staying in power in Syria is growing by the day .\nThe fact that it appears that Russia may have effectively \u201c won \u201d the proxy war for the future of Syria as Trump enters office might sound like a bad place to make a deal , but in fact it could end up being just the opposite . That \u2019 s because it would eliminate the biggest difference between the US and Russia \u2014 what to do about Assad \u2014 and then bring their putatively shared interests of defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria back into the foreground .\n\u201c If Assad really is successful in wiping out the rebels , in a way , it makes the question of the differences in US and Russian approaches moot , \u201d Yoshiko Herrera , a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin Madison who specializes in Russia , says .\nBoth the US and Russia have a national security interest in wiping out ISIS , and that \u2019 s what makes the scenario ripe for deals . Russia \u2019 s commitment to the cause could also relieve Trump of some of the burden of having a military presence in the region should the US and Russia both decide to invest in a sustained campaign against ISIS in the region .\nUS-Russian cooperation in Syria wouldn \u2019 t be without enormous challenges . Trump would receive huge pushback from critics in both parties who believe it would be unconscionable to allow the brutal Assad regime , stained with the blood of countless war crimes , to stay in power .\nThe Pentagon and CIA , meanwhile , could balk at the thought of sharing intelligence in the Middle East in light of mounting evidence that Russia used cyberattacks in a bid to tip the US election .\nThe third major domain in which Trump can relax relations with Russia is related to how he approaches NATO . The Cold War\u2013era military alliance was formed to protect Europe from the Soviet Union , and today one of its roles is serving as a bulwark against Russian influence and expansionism . If Trump continues to criticize NATO or takes steps to substantively reduce American support for the alliance , that \u2019 s automatically beneficial to Russia .\n\u201c Previous to Trump , every incoming president has been a supporter and defender of NATO , \u201d Herrera says . She believes that just with rhetoric , Trump can deal significant damage to the meaning of NATO and cause its enemies to make new calculations about the costs of attacking member states .\nUnder Trump , the US could theoretically devote less money to NATO \u2019 s budget , or be less inclined to participate in the installation of defense equipment or deployment of troops in Eastern Europe to deter Russia from pulling a repeat of what did with Crimea . All of this in turn makes Russia more relaxed and gives it more leverage over Eastern European states .\n\u201c Russia has been annoyed and threatened with the US for being the world \u2019 s police , for its very expansive foreign policy that reaches into many of Russia \u2019 s traditional areas of national interest , \u201d Mariya Omelicheva , a scholar of Russian foreign policy at the University of Kansas , says .\nIf Trump takes actual policy steps back from NATO , combined with his musing about the alliance \u2019 s value on the campaign trail , NATO allies might start to think that the US can \u2019 t be trusted to defend them . Then they \u2019 ll start to wonder why they bother to adhere to this alliance in the first place \u2014 essentially calling one of the pillars of the postwar world order into question .",
