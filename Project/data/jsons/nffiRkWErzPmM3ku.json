Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , the wording dispute is \u201c unfortunate. \u201d On the whole , the international community agrees that sexual violence in conflict must be stopped , and victims receive care . Finding a silver lining , Mr. Erken says the Trump administration has continued the U.S. priority of saving women \u2019 s lives and empowering girls , and notes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with the UNFPA \u2019 s executive director . \u201c He actually said there is more that unites us than divides us , \u201d Mr. Erken says , \u201c and we feel that is something we can work with . \u201d\nRemoving the phrase , code for abortion among conservative groups , set off a caustic debate , revealing deep global fissures over women \u2019 s rights . Was it an attack on women \u2019 s health and rights , or the welcome elevation of the sanctity of unborn life on the global stage ?\nFor the first time , the Trump administration has scored a victory in imposing the language of its staunch anti-abortion position in the international arena . In a Security Council debate over a resolution on sexual violence in conflict , the U.S. \u00adsucceeded in having the words \u201c sexual and reproductive health \u201d stripped from a United Nations text .\nFor some , it \u2019 s an attack on women \u2019 s health and rights . For others , it \u2019 s a welcome and long-overdue elevation of the sanctity of unborn life on the global stage .\nAfter a couple of years of trying , the Trump administration appears to be making headway in its efforts to take its conservative views on reproductive health policies , including a war on abortion , to the United Nations .\nBut for many of the United States \u2019 closest allies , from Britain to France and Germany , the initiative signals an alarming shift away from Western values they have long promoted together , including women \u2019 s rights and gender equality . Instead , they see their traditional friend and leader moving toward the camp of socially conservative countries like Russia , Saudi Arabia , and others that have not been at the forefront of promoting women \u2019 s issues at the U.N .\nStarting early in the Trump presidency , the administration took a series of actions to strip reproductive health allocations from U.S. foreign assistance . Now the Trump administration has scored a victory in imposing the language of its staunch anti-abortion position in the international arena .\nIn the U.N. Security Council debate late last month over a German-sponsored resolution on sexual violence in conflict , the U.S. succeeded for the first time in having the words \u201c sexual and reproductive health \u201d stripped from a U.N. text . The U.S. threatened to use its veto if the offending phrase was not removed , and ultimately it was .\nTo many , the phrase might seem to offer little to fuss about , but removing it set off a caustic debate , revealing the deep fissures that continue to mark the international community over the issue of women \u2019 s rights .\nFor human rights advocates , removal of the words \u201c sexual and reproductive health \u201d from a U.N. resolution represents a worrisome setback for women \u2019 s equality globally , because the words had over the past quarter century become the standard phrasing used to confirm women \u2019 s rights , in particular access to prenatal care and other features of reproductive health , and to promote women \u2019 s empowerment .\nMaking matters worse , these advocates say , is that it is now the U.S. that has \u201c switched camps \u201d and is bringing the setbacks that American women \u2019 s reproductive health is facing domestically to the international stage . The wave of restrictive abortion legislation moving through a growing number of U.S. states and fomenting bitter debates on women \u2019 s rights is seen moving to the international arena .\nSeth Wenig/AP Members of the U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution concerning sexual violence in warfare , at the United Nations headquarters , on April 23 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not news to anyone how important this issue is to Trump \u2019 s base , but the U.S. bringing its culture wars to the Security Council is completely inappropriate when the protection of civilian victims of sexual violence \u2013 women and children \u2013 is what \u2019 s at stake , \u201d says Anne Marie Goetz , a clinical professor at New York University \u2019 s Center for Global Affairs and an expert in women \u2019 s empowerment in peace-building .\nBut to the community of socially conservative organizations and anti-abortion advocates , particularly in the U.S. , the phrase \u201c sexual and reproductive health \u201d had become code for abortion . Worse still , its recurring use suggested to these groups a normalization of abortion and its spread into international policy .\nFor those organizations , the arrival in Washington of a socially conservative administration \u2013 both Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are evangelical Christians who have said their faith directs them in everything they do \u2013 represented an opportunity to reverse the absence of anti-abortion convictions in U.S. foreign policy .\n\u201c We \u2019 re seeing this administration elevate the pro-life cause in foreign policy like never before , and we \u2019 re very grateful for the U.S. position on this [ sexual violence ] resolution , because it tells us things are changing , \u201d says Stefano Gennarini , vice president for the Center for Legal Studies at the Center for Family and Human Rights , or C-Fam , in New York .\nMr. Gennarini calls accusations that the U.S. is infecting the consensus-driven policymaking at the U.N. with its own cultural battles \u201c ridiculous \u201d \u2013 but at the same time he insists it would be wrong to conclude that the arrival of a socially conservative administration in Washington means the global fight for \u201c conservative family values \u201d is won .\n\u201c Keep in mind that while it \u2019 s clear the pro-life cause is moving to the forefront of a conservative U.S. foreign policy , \u201d he says , \u201c it \u2019 s also true that the [ abortion rights ] side is more assertive also and is not about to back down . \u201d\nThe U.S. position infuriated allies who have relied on American heft on the Security Council to help promote what for decades have been seen as common Western values \u2013 including the rights of women \u2013 and to ward off backsliding from those values .\nAs the French ambassador to the U.N. , Francois Delattre , told his council colleagues the day of the resolution vote , \u201c It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict \u2013 and who obviously didn \u2019 t choose to become pregnant \u2013 should have the right to terminate their pregnancy . \u201d\nSome women \u2019 s rights advocates said the U.S. action was particularly stinging because it comes at a time when sexual violence in conflict is on the rise and has gained global attention . Harrowing examples of victims of sexual violence in conflict \u2013 from the Rohingya in Myanmar to the Yazidis and other victims of Islamic State \u2013 not getting care and being forced to carry to term the offspring of rape seem to have multiplied in recent years .\nU.S. officials said during the debate on the resolution that while the U.S. agrees that more must be done to care for the victims of sexual violence , it could not agree to any language , explicit or implicit , that suggests acceptance of abortion . After the council vote , the White House indicated the adopted resolution was more \u201c in line \u201d with U.S. priorities .\nThose priorities during the Trump administration have included setting a standard of \u201c protecting life in global health assistance \u201d that bars funding for foreign organizations that include abortion information or access among their services , and cutting funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund , or UNFPA , the U.N. \u2019 s lead agency on sexual and reproductive health issues .\nDr. Goetz , who worked on women \u2019 s issues at the U.N. for nearly a decade , says the Trump administration has been making increasingly conservative appointments to U.S. government agencies , such as USAID and Health and Human Services , that play important roles in setting international policies on women \u2019 s health and empowerment .\nThose appointees have sought to strike the \u201c sexual and reproductive health \u201d language from documents in other U.N. forums , such as the Commission for the Status of Women . But she says the U.S. has been unsuccessful there because other venues , including the U.N. General Assembly , work by consensus . Only in the Security Council does the U.S. have veto power .\nU.N. officials are not happy about what the recent debate on the sexual violence resolution may portend for reproductive health globally , but they also suggest that , given a rising global clamor over abortion , and not just in the U.S. , the outcome could have been worse .\n\u201c Of course it \u2019 s unfortunate that the words \u2018 sexual and reproductive health \u2019 were taken out , but overall it is not a bad resolution , \u201d says Arthur Erken , director of communications and strategic partnerships at UNFPA in New York . He notes that the resolution includes a reference to boys and men as victims of sexual violence in conflict \u2013 a first \u2013 and that it \u201c reaffirms \u201d the Security Council \u2019 s commitment to earlier resolutions on the issue in 2009 and 2013 \u2013 both of which include the \u201c sexual and reproductive health \u201d language .\n\u201c That tells me that even though the specific words may have been taken out , the resolution is still a confirmation of international support for getting vital services to the victims of sexual violence in conflict , \u201d he says .\nIndeed for Mr. Erken it is \u201c unfortunate \u201d that the issue of sexual violence in conflict got mired in a debate over wording , since on the whole the international community agrees that the scourge must be stopped , and that when it does occur its victims must receive care .\nNoting that on average 830 women die each day during delivery or as a result of complications from pregnancy \u2013 500 of those in conflict zones \u2013 he says saving as many of those lives as possible , often with simple provisions of basic maternal care or the presence of a midwife , is something all sides of a festering abortion debate can support .\nAnd that takes Mr. Erken to a view of the evolution in U.S. reproductive health policy that is what he calls \u201c finding the silver lining . \u201d\nYes , he regrets the U.S. cutting of funding for UNFPA , but more because the agency values the prestige of American political support than because it needs U.S. dollars .
