Those without coverage was just under 15 % at that time , then remained in the range of 15 % to 18 % before it started declining sharply two years ago . The law requiring most Americans to have coverage or pay a penalty took effect at the start of 2014 .\n`` An improving economy and a falling unemployment rate may also have accelerated the steep drop in the percentage of uninsured over the past year , '' said the Gallup report . `` However , the uninsured rate is significantly lower than it was in early 2008 , before the depths of the economic recession , suggesting that the recent decline is due to more than just an improving economy . ''\nThose making less than $ 36,000 a year have seen the most significant rate of improvement .
