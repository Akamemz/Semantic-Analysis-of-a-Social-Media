Sign up here . * *\nYou can turn the volume back up on your televisions , the Democratic debate is done and the shouting has ended .\nApparently believing that commitment and sincerity can be measured in decibels , Hillary Clinton turned up the volume in Sunday night \u2019 s showdown with rival Bernie Sanders .\nShe also matched her louder volume with sharper attacks on Sanders . But the Vermont socialist came ready to fight , counterpunching and even landing a few blows . You \u2019 d have to give him the win , if only narrowly , on the grounds that not only did he dominate the discussion but that she was strangely treating him as the frontrunner .\nOr maybe it was just that she was trying to fight on Sanders \u2019 turf . He \u2019 s been shouting since before it was cool . Clinton seems to be abandoning the mantra of her campaign \u2013 \u201c I \u2019 m a fighter \u201d \u2013 for an effort to approximate the anger that candidates on both sides of the aisle have been trying , with varying degrees of success , to ape .\nBut it \u2019 s hard to believe that Clinton is angry , or at least that she is angry about something other than the fact that her party seems to delight in spurning her . Life has been very good to the Clintons over the past 16 years , to say the least . Except for the politics part .\nClinton and her crew could assuage themselves after her 2008 primary loss that they were victims of history \u2013 the sudden ascendance of a gifted , African-American candidate was more of a force of nature than a reflection of her political weakness .\nBut what if she were struggling with a guy who was deeply white and five years older than her ? What if the guy this time was not a gifted speechmaker but one who gave shout-y campaign boilerplate in a Brooklyn honk ? What if he had been honking around Washington for 25 years and was generally written off as a crank ?\nIt has apparently all been enough to rattle Clinton , whose onetime indulgence of Sanders has turned into attacks and who seems to be on the verge of yet another campaign reboot .\nTied or trailing Sanders in the first two nominating contests , it \u2019 s hard to say she \u2019 s wrong . A huge lead in South Carolina and what , last month at least , was a wide advantage in Nevada still suggest that Clinton isn \u2019 t yet in danger of being toppled a second time \u2013 and that her strategy of aggressively pursuing black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition is paying off .\nBut would those leads look so stout if Clinton were to lose the first two contests ? Certainly not . Just ask South Carolina Democratic powerbroker Rep. Jim Clyburn , who told the NYT , \u201c The reality is , if Mrs. Clinton loses Iowa and New Hampshire , that could create new and real problems for her here . \u201d\nAs of now , you can still call Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee , but we are now seeing a scenario in which she might have to waste several damaging months on a fight that will harm her general election chances and distract public attention from the bazooka blasts on the GOP side .\nAmerica seems to owe an awful lot to high-living French noblemen . And if you like the idea of separation of power between branches of government , then say \u2018 Joyeux anniversaire \u2019 to Charles-Louis de Secondat , Baron de La Br\u00e8de et de Montesquieu , born on this date in 1689 . Montesquieu led something of a dissipated life as a young nobleman at court in Paris , but became increasingly serious about his political writing and philosophizing . A visit to England would open his mind further and give birth to a riot of political thought . But perhaps chief among his insights was the value of divided government . Britannica explains : \u201c Dividing political authority into the legislative , executive , and judicial powers , [ Montesquieu ] asserted that , in the state that most effectively promotes liberty , these three powers must be confided to different individuals or bodies , acting independently\u2026 Though its accuracy has in more recent times been disputed , in its own century it was admired and held authoritative , even in England ; it inspired the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Constitution of the United States . \u201d\nRepublican Nomination \u2013 Trump 34.5 percent ; Cruz 19.3 percent ; Rubio 11.8 percent ; Carson 9.0 percent\nThe NYT digs deep into the life of Ted Cruz \u2019 s wife , Heidi , with a focus on an incident 11 years ago in which a police officer found her , head in hands , sitting beside an expressway onramp . The article , which revisits the incident twice and at length , casts her as an unstable woman who has thrown away a promising career to support her husband . It is some really ugly stuff .\nTrump in free fire zone with Cruz attacks - ABC News : \u201c With two weeks left before voters in Iowa cast the very first votes in the 2016 presidential election , Republican front-runner Donald Trump is turning up the heat on his fiercest rival in the Hawkeye State -\u2013 Sen. Ted Cruz . \u2018 I do n't think Ted Cruz has a great chance , to be honest with you , \u2019 Trump told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos in an interview on \u201c This Week \u201d Sunday . \u2018 Look , the truth is , he 's a nasty guy . He was so nice to me . I mean , I knew it . I was watching . I kept saying , \u2018 Come on Ted . Let \u2019 s go , okay. \u2019 But he \u2019 s a nasty guy . Nobody likes him . Nobody in Congress likes him . Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him . He \u2019 s a very \u2013- he 's got an edge that \u2019 s not good .

Ted Cruz of Texas is trying to beat the odds and pull out victories in both [ Iowa and New Hampshire ] \u2026On Sunday he started a five-day New Hampshire tour packed with 17 events in all 10 of the state \u2019 s counties . \u201d\nTampa Bay Times : \u201c Marco Rubio went shopping for a handgun on Christmas Eve , tying it to the threat of ISIS . \u2018 I have a right to protect my family if someone were to come after us , \u2019 he said Sunday on CBS \u2019 Face the Nation . \u2018 In fact , if ISIS were to visit us , or our communities , at any moment , the last line of defense between ISIS and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them , or from a criminal , or anyone else who seeks to do us harm .
