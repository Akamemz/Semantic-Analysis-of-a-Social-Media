But France , which has six hostages in Mali and has citizens who have joined al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , is playing an increasing role behind the scenes .\nMany in the West fear that northeast Mali and the arid Sahel region could become the new Afghanistan , a no-man \u2019 s-land where extremists can train , impose hardline Islamic law and plot terror attacks abroad . And France , former colonial ruler to countries across the Sahel , is a prime target .\n\u201c This is actually a major threat \u2014 to French interests in the region , and to France itself , \u201d said Francois Heisbourg , an expert at the Foundation for Strategic Research , a partially state-funded think tank in Paris . \u201c This is like Afghanistan 1996 . This is like when Bin Laden found a place that was larger than France in which he could organize training camps , in which he could provide stable preparations for organizing far-flung terror attacks . \u201d\nFrance is turning its attention to the Sahel just as it is accelerating its pullout of combat troops from Afghanistan ahead of other NATO allies .\nA French defense official said Monday that France plans to move two surveillance drones to western Africa from Afghanistan by year-end , though he did not provide details . France is also reported to have special forces in the region around Mali , and to have contracted out surveillance of Mali to a private company .\nTop-level American and French military leaders and diplomats , including U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson , began two days of talks in Paris on Monday on intelligence-gathering and security in the Sahel region , including Mali , diplomats from both sides told the AP .\nThe defense official and diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren \u2019 t authorized to talk publicly about the activities .\nThe Paris meetings follow a U.N. Security Council resolution that gives Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about a month to help Malian authorities devise a plan to regain control of the north . And on Friday , African leaders met in Bamako , Mali \u2019 s capital , to prepare a plan for a military intervention in the north , which was seized under the cover of a coup d \u2019 etat six months ago .\nThe United States is partnering with France , which has airpower and hundreds of troops across western Africa \u2014 in Senegal , Ivory Coast , Chad and Gabon , French and U.S. officials said . The United States has no full-time military presence in Africa , but from time to time sends trainers or other advisers on specific missions , according to Africom , the U.S. military command for Africa based in Stuttgart , Germany .\nThe attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi , Libya , last month that left four Americans dead including the U.S. ambassador has fanned an increasing American awareness of the terror threat in the Sahel .\nThe United States sees France as a key player in Mali , and the French defense official said the U.S. \u201c has conferred to us the role of leader \u201d in the crisis .\nOther Western powers are increasingly worried about a lawless Mali .\nOn Monday , Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany would be prepared to take part in a European mission to train and provide logistical support for Malian security forces . European Union members are considering a noncombat training mission to help the interim Malian government .\n\u201c Free democratic states can not accept international terrorism gaining a safe refuge in the north of the country , \u201d Merkel told a German military conference near Berlin .\nYet despite the clear French interest in a Mali campaign , French officials don \u2019 t want to be seen as too aggressive in helping Mali fight AQIM and its allies \u2014 the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa , known as MUJAO , and Ansar Dine , which now controls the famed Malian city of Timbuktu .\nFrench President Francois Hollande , his popularity flailing just five months since he took office , faces a variety of challenges .\nFirst , he wants to free the hostages while quashing the group that holds them . His hardline stance is puzzling to some observers but suggests that larger geopolitical concerns may be holding sway over concern for the hostages .\nSecondly , Hollande has just returned from a trip to Senegal and Congo , where he vowed a new , fairer French relationship with Africa . A more robust French military footprint could revive allegations of a long-despised colonialist mindset .\nBut France is also determined to prevent more kidnappings across Africa , where thousands of French expatriates live under the growing threat of terrorism .\nAnd French authorities have long been concerned that home-grown Islamic militants could get training abroad , then come back to France to sow terror \u2014 a fear borne out by at least two terrorism cases publicly announced this year .\nOn Friday , a high-level European diplomat told the AP that French authorities know that AQIM has French nationals as members , though the official didn \u2019 t provide an estimate of how many .\n\u201c At this phase , it \u2019 s not a very high number , \u201d the official said . \u201c But if nothing happens on the ground , and AQIM continues to settle in in a durable way and get structure , it \u2019 s clearly a number that \u2019 s going to grow . \u201d\nWhether or when an international intervention in Mali will come remains uncertain .\nAt a meeting on the Sahel at the United Nations last month , Hollande called for an African-led military intervention in Mali \u201c as quickly as possible. \u201d Since then , he has reiterated that France won \u2019 t provide any ground troops .
