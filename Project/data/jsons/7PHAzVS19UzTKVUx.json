Public opinion about this issue has changed little in recent years .\nRepublicans and Democrats continue to have very different views about how the Supreme Court should base its rulings : About three-quarters ( 74 % ) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say it should base its rulings on its understanding of the Constitution \u2019 s original meaning , while about a quarter ( 23 % ) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the same . This gap is slightly wider than it was in February 2014 , when 68 % of Republicans and Republican leaners and 27 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners said the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution based on how it was originally written .\nThere are substantial differences in these views by age , race and ethnicity , education , and religious affiliation .\nBy about two-to-one ( 63 % to 31 % ) , adults younger than 30 say the court should base its rulings on its understanding of the Constitution \u2019 s current meaning , rather than what it meant when originally written .
