That information is attributed to unidentified \u201c American officials with knowledge of \u201d the matter . If \u201c exceeds 300 pages \u201d means something close to 300 pages , it is less than I would have bet on .\nOf course , \u201c exceeds 300 pages \u201d could mean lots more than 300 pages . The Times notes that Fox \u2019 s Andrew Napolitano has claimed the report is 700 pages long ( his basis for saying so is not clear ) . The paper also reminds us that Ken Starr \u2019 s Clinton-Lewinsky report was 445 pages long , last year \u2019 s inspector-general report on the Clinton emails investigation was 500 pages , and the 9/11 Commission report was 567 .\nMeanwhile , Politico reports that Attorney General Bill Barr has told House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler ( D. , N.Y. ) how long the report is . Nadler has not revealed the number of pages ; he has just said it is \u201c very substantial. \u201d When asked whether that means fewer than a thousand pages , Nadler replied , \u201c I would think so. \u201d He added that Barr would not commit to the April 2 deadline House Democrats would like to impose .\nOf course , page counts can be much ado about nothing . But the Times and the Democrats seem determined to make something out of them , suggesting that , since Attorney General Barr \u2019 s letter about Mueller \u2019 s report was only four pages ( although the Gray Lady allows that these pages were \u201c dense \u201d ) , this \u201c raises questions about what Barr might have left out . \u201d\nJim Geraghty has an excellent analysis of this claim in today \u2019 s Morning Jolt .
