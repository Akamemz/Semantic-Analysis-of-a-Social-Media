The novel coronavirus pandemic , and the threat posed by it to the socioeconomic fabric of nations , pushed many governments around the world into an existential crisis and forced them to switch to survival mode . Populist politicians in these countries , who failed to respond to this public health crisis swiftly and efficiently , resorted to scapegoating minority communities , especially Muslims , to justify their shortcomings .\nThis has put millions of people , who were subjected to discrimination , abuse and oppression even before the start of the pandemic , in a bind . In many countries around the world underprivileged Muslims are now facing not only a pandemic that is threatening their lives and livelihoods , but also a spike in institutionalised Islamophobia .\nIn India , since the emergence of COVID-19 , members of the country 's 200 million-strong Muslim community have repeatedly been accused of being `` super spreaders '' of coronavirus both by the media and the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) .\nIn late March , after a Muslim religious gathering in New Delhi allegedly led to a rise in the number of coronavirus cases in the city , a politician from the BJP dubbed the gathering `` corona terrorism '' , and called for Muslims who attend mosques amid the pandemic to be `` punished like terrorists '' . As a result , `` corona jihad '' became a trending topic on social media and many Muslims , including volunteers distributing relief material , faced physical and verbal attacks . A BJP legislator from the state of Uttar Pradesh , meanwhile , called for a boycott of Muslim vendors , accusing them of `` infecting vegetables with saliva '' .\nThe Indian media also contributed to the stigmatisation of Muslims during the pandemic .

Muslims faced waves of violence at the hands of nationalists . The government was accused of not doing enough to protect this minority community and bring those who attack them to justice .\nSo , unsurprisingly , when COVID-19 reached Sri Lanka , some prominent media organisations and nationalists who are close to the current government were quick to blame Muslims , who form nearly 10 percent of the population , for the spread of the virus . Just like in India , Muslim religious practices were singled out as `` super spreader events '' and Sri Lankans who belong to the Buddhist majority were warned not to buy food items from Muslim vendors .\nIn April , the government made cremations compulsory for coronavirus victims , which goes against the Islamic tradition of burying the dead .
