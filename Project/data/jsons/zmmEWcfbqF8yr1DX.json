For all of the blog posts , check out @ Jamie_Maz \u2019 s full Twitter thread .\nIn a statement to Mediate on Monday , Reid at first said that the recently resurfaced blog posts were \u201c fabricated \u201d :\nIn December I learned that an unknown , external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog , The Reid Report , to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology . I began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity , and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach . The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago . Now that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries . I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused , not just to me , but to my family and communities that I care deeply about : LGBTQ , immigrants , people of color and other marginalized groups .\nAccording to Reid \u2019 s attorneys , the FBI is currently investigating her claim and \u201c potential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts , including personal email and blog accounts , belonging to Joy-Ann Reid . \u201d\nOn Saturday , Reid seemed to back off the claim \u2014 acknowledging the lack of evidence for it and issuing an apology for any past \u201c hurtful \u201d comments toward the LGBTQ community , but also indicating that she still does not \u201c believe \u201d she wrote the blog posts .\nEven before her apology , some of Reid \u2019 s colleagues came to her defense . Joan Walsh , a CNN contributor and friend of Reid \u2019 s , wrote that she tracked Reid \u2019 s work while she was an editor at Salon and , in fact , was the first person to publish Reid . \u201c Obviously , none of us ever saw the kinds of homophobic posts she \u2019 s now accused of . If we had , we \u2019 d have stopped publishing her , \u201d Walsh wrote . She added that while she did not read everything Reid wrote , she \u201c did read it enough to know that [ Reid ] did not regularly reflect the attitudes [ Reid ] \u2019 s accused of here . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the LGBTQ advocacy group , PFLAG National , rescinded Reid \u2019 s Straight for Equality in Media Award in response to the allegations . And the Daily Beast \u201c hit pause \u201d on Reid \u2019 s column for the news site .\nPeople were always highly skeptical of Reid \u2019 s initial claim that she was hacked .\nAccording to Jonathan Nichols , the cybersecurity expert hired by Reid , the hacks would have taken place around 2005 to 2009 \u2014 which is why the blog posts were picked up by the Wayback Machine , which archives websites in real time , and tagged during that time period .\nReporter Hayley Miller gave a very good breakdown at HuffPost of the reasons to be skeptical of the hacking claim . But here is the key point :\nSince Wayback Machine captures sites in real time , this means someone would have had to hack Reid \u2019 s blog numerous times between 2005 and 2009 . If someone hacked her blog recently and attempted to change the timestamps to a previous year , Wayback Machine would still archive the posts according to the date they were actually hacked . \u2026 It \u2019 s unclear who would repeatedly target Reid in the mid-to-late-2000s , more than a decade before she rose to national fame with MSNBC . Reid \u2019 s Wikipedia page wasn \u2019 t even created until 2014 .\nAnother problem : Why didn \u2019 t Reid notice that someone else was repeatedly posting on her blog without her permission in the mid-to-late 2000s ? \u201c For example , an allegedly fraudulent post was added on March 7 , 2005 . On March 9 , 2005 , Reid published a post that has not been called into question , \u201d Miller wrote . \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t the supposedly unfamiliar post have caught her eye when she added the next one ? \u201d\nIn Reid \u2019 s defense , Nichols pointed to the lack of comments in the homophobic posts as evidence that the blog was hacked \u2014 because \u201c [ i ] f those posts were real , they would have undoubtedly elicited responses from Ms. Reid \u2019 s base. \u201d But , Miller noted , \u201c there don \u2019 t appear to be any comments on most of the posts from the mid-2000s . \u201d\nNichols further expanded his argument by claiming that some of the screenshots of the posts were themselves doctored . \u201c We have significant evidence indicating that not only was Ms. Reid \u2019 s old blog compromised , some of the recently circulated posts were not even on the site at any time , suggesting that these instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation with the intent to tarnish Ms. Reid \u2019 s character , \u201d he wrote in a statement on Tuesday .\nAccording to Miller , @ Jamie_Maz has denied altering the screenshots beyond underlining some key segments . And many of the blog posts could be found on the Wayback Machine \u2014 so , at the very least , some of them are real .\nThe Wayback Machine , meanwhile , noted in a blog post that its own investigation \u201c found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking \u201d on its end , suggesting that the Wayback Machine wasn \u2019 t hacked to misleadingly show fraudulent blog posts . Old Dominion University computer scientist Michael Nelson also found that other internet archiving websites , beyond the Wayback Machine , had picked up and dated the old blog posts \u2014 so a hack that targeted the archives would have to have hit those other sites too , which Nelson described as \u201c extraordinarily unlikely . \u201d\nAnother report , by Daily Beast contributor Kevin Poulsen , found methodological errors in Nichols \u2019 s analysis for Reid \u2014 which Nichols himself acknowledged , saying he \u2019 s \u201c looking to resolve the discrepancy . \u201d\nBeyond the blog posts themselves , the style of comments weren \u2019 t exactly out of character for Reid . In recent days , for example , tweets have resurfaced in which Reid made other anti-LGBTQ remarks , from suggesting that conservative pundit Ann Coulter is a man to repeatedly calling Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) \u201c Miss Lindsey \u201d \u2014 indicating that this was a pattern beyond her initially resurfaced blog posts about Charlie Crist .\n`` @ ricksanchezcnn : i 'm going to interview ann coulter tonite , what do u want me to ask her ? '' /do n't you mean `` shim ? '' \u2014 Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) July 23 , 2010\nRT @ TheReidReport P.M. clicks : Colbert advises Miss Lindsey , Milbank advises Charlie http : //bit.ly/adrk3T \u2014 Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) April 25 , 2010\nReid apologized for the Coulter tweets on Saturday . \u201c I want to apologize to the trans community and to Ann . Those tweets were wrong and horrible , \u201d she said .\nOne thing driving this issue to the forefront is Reid \u2019 s past political commentary \u2014 which has drawn the ire of people from both the left and right .\nOn the left , Reid was very critical of Bernie Sanders \u2019 s 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton . This has created an ongoing conflict between Reid and Sanders supporters in particular \u2014 which you can get a taste of through a quick Google search for \u201c Joy Reid Bernie Sanders . \u201d\nReid , for example , previously said that Sanders is \u201c not a Democrat \u201d on Meet the Press \u2014 since he has classified as an independent before and after the 2016 campaign . She doubled down on this theme in tweets last year , writing that \u201c [ t ] his demand : that people outside a party get to choose that party \u2019 s nominees , is always amazing to me . \u201d\nThis demand : that people outside a party get to choose that party 's nominees , is always amazing to me . https : //t.co/rS4Du58hLU \u2014 Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) June 12 , 2017\nIt 's like saying : `` I 'm not going to be your roommate , but I demand the right to help you choose an apartment since I might visit one day . '' \u2014 Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) June 12 , 2017\nIn fact , not only do I not want to be your roommate , I intend to trash whatever apartment you pick when I visit . But let me pick the place ! \u2014 Joy Reid ( @ JoyAnnReid ) June 12 , 2017\nThe Twitter thread goes on , ending with , \u201c Not saying they \u2019 re not welcome to move in . I \u2019 m sure the party would welcome them . But for now ? They \u2019 re * that * longterm couch friend . \u201d\nReid also criticized some Sanders supporters , in 2016 hosting a segment on \u201c Bernie bros \u201d who were \u201c accused of online trolling , misogyny , and outright bigotry. \u201d Talking to a Washington Post reporter who had written about \u201c some of Bernie Sanders \u2019 s more vitriolic supporters , \u201d Reid said , \u201c I read your piece , and it all was so very familiar as somebody who covers this race and who tweets a lot , and so is on social media . \u201d\nAt one point , Reid even criticized Sanders for how he treats his wife , in 2017 writing that Sanders was not a good example of a \u201c credible national authority figure \u201d in the context of # MeToo due to \u201c his physical dismissal of women in his presence ( including his own wife ) . \u201d That tweet drew a response from Jane Sanders , the senator \u2019 s wife , who criticized Reid \u2019 s \u201c biased reporting about Bernie during the last 2 years . \u201d\nI did n't answer your biased reporting about Bernie during the last 2 years @ JoyAnnReid . But do n't ever use me to demean my husband . I am very happy & very proud to be Bernie 's wife . Your perception could n't be more wrong . Have you ever talked with him ? You 've never spoken w/me . https : //t.co/SZG7uV8cfO \u2014 Jane O'Meara Sanders ( @ janeosanders ) November 29 , 2017\nOn the right , Reid has long been very critical of Trump , from his policies against minority Americans to his alleged collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign . All of this has led Reid to become a big pundit among Trump critics \u2014 leading the New York Times to profile her in a 2018 article headlined , \u201c How Joy Reid of MSNBC Became a Heroine of the Resistance . \u201d\nAll of that is to lay the context of why a lot of people were so quick to go after Reid once the latest allegations of homophobia came out : In a lot of circles on the left and right , she had a lot of critics beforehand .\nThat helps explain why , for example , Fox News host Tucker Carlson used a whole segment to blast Reid . He said her claim that she was hacked was \u201c childish \u201d and argued that \u201c you \u2019 d have to be a moron to believe it. \u201d But he also went after her political views , calling her an \u201c icon on the progressive left \u201d and claiming that \u201c there is not a single fashionable opinion that Joy Reid doesn \u2019 t have or isn \u2019 t happy to denounce you for not having \u201d \u2014 showing that his criticisms of Reid go beyond the recent allegations .\nOn the other side , it also helps explain why Trump critics like Joan Walsh and Jeffrey Toobin were so quick to defend her .\nThat does not prove that the allegations are false or driven by some sort of political conspiracy , or that people are only criticizing or defending Reid due to her political views . But it \u2019 s important context as the accusations against Reid get more discussion in the news and social media .\nMany people really have changed their minds on LGBTQ issues\nIn the background is the fact that if Reid really made anti-LGBTQ comments in the mid-to-late 2000s and simply changed her views since then , it wouldn \u2019 t be surprising .\nAfter all , major political figures like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton went through their own political transformations on these issues over the years \u2014 at first opposing same-sex marriage before eventually supporting it . While it was easy to dismiss these evolutions as political opportunism once marriage equality became more popular , the reality is that a lot of Americans have gone through a similar transformation to support more LGBTQ rights .\nConsider Gallup \u2019 s polling : From 1996 to 2017 , both Democrats and Republicans became more supportive of same-sex marriage \u2014 driving support to a record high of 64 percent last year .\nSimilarly , the US public has over time become more favorable toward homosexuality overall and transgender people in general .\nThat in no way justifies the homophobia or bigotry in the old blog posts . But it provides some context for the era in which they occurred .\nIn this context , it wouldn \u2019 t be surprising if someone blogging in 2005 held different views about LGBTQ people than they do today . And while that might at times be embarrassing or offensive , it \u2019 s part of being a growing , thinking human being in a rapidly changing world .\nAfter acknowledging the lack of evidence for the hacking claim on Saturday , Reid said on her show that she herself has changed : \u201c The person I am now is not the person I was then . I like to think I \u2019 ve gotten better as a person over time \u2014 that I \u2019 m still growing , that I \u2019 m not the same person I was 10 or five or even one year ago . And I know that my goal is to try to be a better person and a better ally . \u201d",

Reaching across the aisle is more important than satisfying liberals. Gays are the odd ones out of Obama's victory because they are pushing stupid issues like gay marriage. pic.twitter.com/NmSl97jUKr \u2014 Not a bot (@Jamie_Maz) April 18, 2018\n\nAgain, these are only a few examples. For all of the blog posts, check out @Jamie_Maz\u2019s full Twitter thread.\n\nReid initially claimed she was hacked\n\nIn a statement to Mediate on Monday, Reid at first said that the recently resurfaced blog posts were \u201cfabricated\u201d:\n\nIn December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology. I began working with a cyber-security expert who first identified the unauthorized activity, and we notified federal law enforcement officials of the breach. The manipulated material seems to be part of an effort to taint my character with false information by distorting a blog that ended a decade ago. Now that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries. I hope that whoever corrupted the site recognizes the pain they have caused, not just to me, but to my family and communities that I care deeply about: LGBTQ, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized groups.\n\nAccording to Reid\u2019s attorneys, the FBI is currently investigating her claim and \u201cpotential criminal activities surrounding several online accounts, including personal email and blog accounts, belonging to Joy-Ann Reid.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Reid seemed to back off the claim \u2014 acknowledging the lack of evidence for it and issuing an apology for any past \u201churtful\u201d comments toward the LGBTQ community, but also indicating that she still does not \u201cbelieve\u201d she wrote the blog posts.\n\nEven before her apology, some of Reid\u2019s colleagues came to her defense. Joan Walsh, a CNN contributor and friend of Reid\u2019s, wrote that she tracked Reid\u2019s work while she was an editor at Salon and, in fact, was the first person to publish Reid. \u201cObviously, none of us ever saw the kinds of homophobic posts she\u2019s now accused of. If we had, we\u2019d have stopped publishing her,\u201d Walsh wrote. She added that while she did not read everything Reid wrote, she \u201cdid read it enough to know that [Reid] did not regularly reflect the attitudes [Reid]\u2019s accused of here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the LGBTQ advocacy group, PFLAG National, rescinded Reid\u2019s Straight for Equality in Media Award in response to the allegations. And the Daily Beast \u201chit pause\u201d on Reid\u2019s column for the news site.\n\nThe hacking claim fell apart under scrutiny\n\nPeople were always highly skeptical of Reid\u2019s initial claim that she was hacked.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Nichols, the cybersecurity expert hired by Reid, the hacks would have taken place around 2005 to 2009 \u2014 which is why the blog posts were picked up by the Wayback Machine, which archives websites in real time, and tagged during that time period.\n\nReporter Hayley Miller gave a very good breakdown at HuffPost of the reasons to be skeptical of the hacking claim. But here is the key point:\n\nSince Wayback Machine captures sites in real time, this means someone would have had to hack Reid\u2019s blog numerous times between 2005 and 2009. If someone hacked her blog recently and attempted to change the timestamps to a previous year, Wayback Machine would still archive the posts according to the date they were actually hacked. \u2026 It\u2019s unclear who would repeatedly target Reid in the mid-to-late-2000s, more than a decade before she rose to national fame with MSNBC. Reid\u2019s Wikipedia page wasn\u2019t even created until 2014.\n\nAnother problem: Why didn\u2019t Reid notice that someone else was repeatedly posting on her blog without her permission in the mid-to-late 2000s? \u201cFor example, an allegedly fraudulent post was added on March 7, 2005. On March 9, 2005, Reid published a post that has not been called into question,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cWouldn\u2019t the supposedly unfamiliar post have caught her eye when she added the next one?\u201d\n\nIn Reid\u2019s defense, Nichols pointed to the lack of comments in the homophobic posts as evidence that the blog was hacked \u2014 because \u201c[i]f those posts were real, they would have undoubtedly elicited responses from Ms. Reid\u2019s base.\u201d But, Miller noted, \u201cthere don\u2019t appear to be any comments on most of the posts from the mid-2000s.\u201d\n\nNichols further expanded his argument by claiming that some of the screenshots of the posts were themselves doctored. \u201cWe have significant evidence indicating that not only was Ms. Reid\u2019s old blog compromised, some of the recently circulated posts were not even on the site at any time, suggesting that these instances may be the result of screenshot manipulation with the intent to tarnish Ms. Reid\u2019s character,\u201d he wrote in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Miller, @Jamie_Maz has denied altering the screenshots beyond underlining some key segments. And many of the blog posts could be found on the Wayback Machine \u2014 so, at the very least, some of them are real.\n\nThe Wayback Machine, meanwhile, noted in a blog post that its own investigation \u201cfound nothing to indicate tampering or hacking\u201d on its end, suggesting that the Wayback Machine wasn\u2019t hacked to misleadingly show fraudulent blog posts. Old Dominion University computer scientist Michael Nelson also found that other internet archiving websites, beyond the Wayback Machine, had picked up and dated the old blog posts \u2014 so a hack that targeted the archives would have to have hit those other sites too, which Nelson described as \u201cextraordinarily unlikely.\u201d\n\nAnother report, by Daily Beast contributor Kevin Poulsen, found methodological errors in Nichols\u2019s analysis for Reid \u2014 which Nichols himself acknowledged, saying he\u2019s \u201clooking to resolve the discrepancy.\u201d\n\nBeyond the blog posts themselves, the style of comments weren\u2019t exactly out of character for Reid. In recent days, for example, tweets have resurfaced in which Reid made other anti-LGBTQ remarks, from suggesting that conservative pundit Ann Coulter is a man to repeatedly calling Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) \u201cMiss Lindsey\u201d \u2014 indicating that this was a pattern beyond her initially resurfaced blog posts about Charlie Crist.\n\n\"@ricksanchezcnn: i'm going to interview ann coulter tonite , what do u want me to ask her?\" /don't you mean \"shim?\" \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) July 23, 2010\n\nRT @TheReidReport P.M. clicks: Colbert advises Miss Lindsey, Milbank advises Charlie http://bit.ly/adrk3T \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) April 25, 2010\n\nReid apologized for the Coulter tweets on Saturday. \u201cI want to apologize to the trans community and to Ann. Those tweets were wrong and horrible,\u201d she said.\n\nThis has all gotten very political\n\nOne thing driving this issue to the forefront is Reid\u2019s past political commentary \u2014 which has drawn the ire of people from both the left and right.\n\nOn the left, Reid was very critical of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton. This has created an ongoing conflict between Reid and Sanders supporters in particular \u2014 which you can get a taste of through a quick Google search for \u201cJoy Reid Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nReid, for example, previously said that Sanders is \u201cnot a Democrat\u201d on Meet the Press \u2014 since he has classified as an independent before and after the 2016 campaign. She doubled down on this theme in tweets last year, writing that \u201c[t]his demand: that people outside a party get to choose that party\u2019s nominees, is always amazing to me.\u201d\n\nThis demand: that people outside a party get to choose that party's nominees, is always amazing to me. https://t.co/rS4Du58hLU \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) June 12, 2017\n\nIt's like saying: \"I'm not going to be your roommate, but I demand the right to help you choose an apartment since I might visit one day.\" \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) June 12, 2017\n\nIn fact, not only do I not want to be your roommate, I intend to trash whatever apartment you pick when I visit. But let me pick the place! \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) June 12, 2017\n\nThe Twitter thread goes on, ending with, \u201cNot saying they\u2019re not welcome to move in. I\u2019m sure the party would welcome them. But for now? They\u2019re *that* longterm couch friend.\u201d\n\nReid also criticized some Sanders supporters, in 2016 hosting a segment on \u201cBernie bros\u201d who were \u201caccused of online trolling, misogyny, and outright bigotry.\u201d Talking to a Washington Post reporter who had written about \u201csome of Bernie Sanders\u2019s more vitriolic supporters,\u201d Reid said, \u201cI read your piece, and it all was so very familiar as somebody who covers this race and who tweets a lot, and so is on social media.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Reid even criticized Sanders for how he treats his wife, in 2017 writing that Sanders was not a good example of a \u201ccredible national authority figure\u201d in the context of #MeToo due to \u201chis physical dismissal of women in his presence (including his own wife).\u201d That tweet drew a response from Jane Sanders, the senator\u2019s wife, who criticized Reid\u2019s \u201cbiased reporting about Bernie during the last 2 years.\u201d\n\nI didn't answer your biased reporting about Bernie during the last 2 years @JoyAnnReid. But don't ever use me to demean my husband. I am very happy & very proud to be Bernie's wife. Your perception couldn't be more wrong. Have you ever talked with him? You've never spoken w/me. https://t.co/SZG7uV8cfO \u2014 Jane O'Meara Sanders (@janeosanders) November 29, 2017\n\nOn the right, Reid has long been very critical of Trump, from his policies against minority Americans to his alleged collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign. All of this has led Reid to become a big pundit among Trump critics \u2014 leading the New York Times to profile her in a 2018 article headlined, \u201cHow Joy Reid of MSNBC Became a Heroine of the Resistance.\u201d\n\nAll of that is to lay the context of why a lot of people were so quick to go after Reid once the latest allegations of homophobia came out: In a lot of circles on the left and right, she had a lot of critics beforehand.\n\nThat helps explain why, for example, Fox News host Tucker Carlson used a whole segment to blast Reid. He said her claim that she was hacked was \u201cchildish\u201d and argued that \u201cyou\u2019d have to be a moron to believe it.\u201d But he also went after her political views, calling her an \u201cicon on the progressive left\u201d and claiming that \u201cthere is not a single fashionable opinion that Joy Reid doesn\u2019t have or isn\u2019t happy to denounce you for not having\u201d \u2014 showing that his criticisms of Reid go beyond the recent allegations.\n\nOn the other side, it also helps explain why Trump critics like Joan Walsh and Jeffrey Toobin were so quick to defend her.\n\nThat does not prove that the allegations are false or driven by some sort of political conspiracy, or that people are only criticizing or defending Reid due to her political views. But it\u2019s important context as the accusations against Reid get more discussion in the news and social media.\n\nMany people really have changed their minds on LGBTQ issues\n\nIn the background is the fact that if Reid really made anti-LGBTQ comments in the mid-to-late 2000s and simply changed her views since then, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising.\n\nAfter all, major political figures like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton went through their own political transformations on these issues over the years \u2014 at first opposing same-sex marriage before eventually supporting it. While it was easy to dismiss these evolutions as political opportunism once marriage equality became more popular, the reality is that a lot of Americans have gone through a similar transformation to support more LGBTQ rights.\n\nConsider Gallup\u2019s polling: From 1996 to 2017, both Democrats and Republicans became more supportive of same-sex marriage \u2014 driving support to a record high of 64 percent last year.\n\nSimilarly, the US public has over time become more favorable toward homosexuality overall and transgender people in general.\n\nThat in no way justifies the homophobia or bigotry in the old blog posts. But it provides some context for the era in which they occurred.\n\nIn this context, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if someone blogging in 2005 held different views about LGBTQ people than they do today. And while that might at times be embarrassing or offensive, it\u2019s part of being a growing, thinking human being in a rapidly changing world.\n\nAfter acknowledging the lack of evidence for the hacking claim on Saturday, Reid said on her show that she herself has changed: \u201cThe person I am now is not the person I was then. I like to think I\u2019ve gotten better as a person over time \u2014 that I\u2019m still growing, that I\u2019m not the same person I was 10 or five or even one year ago. And I know that my goal is to try to be a better person and a better ally.\u201d",
