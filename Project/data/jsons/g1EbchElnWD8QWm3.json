But they repeatedly stressed that a ruling against the unions here would be significant .\n`` You 're essentially destroying not just the ... shop , but you 're destroying the ability of the union to get money even from the people who do n't agree with what it 's doing , '' Justice Antonin Scalia told the plaintiff 's attorney .\nAt issue are the complaints of home health care workers in Illinois , who object to having to pay `` fair share fees '' to compensate the union for its work . The workers say the fees violate the First Amendment by compelling them to associate with the union .\nThough lower courts have thrown out the lawsuit , if the Supreme Court agrees it could undermine the ability of unions in several states -- not just Illinois -- to collect fees from home care workers . That would , then , chip away at union budgets and membership in the public sector .\nIn Illinois , those workers are classified as state employees because their salaries come from Medicaid .\nPaul Smith , who represented the state , argued that the union fees are being spent on a variety of services , including negotiating contracts , operating a call center and maintaining a `` grievance system .
