Susan Collins ( R-ME ) announcing her support for him , Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation to the Supreme Court is now all but assured .\nHe will be replacing Anthony Kennedy , who was , since at least 2005 , the swing vote on many of the Court \u2019 s most ideologically charged decisions , responsible for 5-4 rulings that legalized same-sex marriage , preserved Roe v. Wade , upheld warrantless wiretapping , blew up campaign finance restrictions , overturned DC \u2019 s handgun ban , and weakened the Voting Rights Act . That position made him one of the most powerful people in America for well over a decade , not even counting the 18 years he shared his position as the Court \u2019 s swing voter with Sandra Day O \u2019 Connor .\nThe new median justice will be Chief Justice John Roberts , a mostly reliable conservative who has proven remarkably willing to overturn decades-old precedents .\nWith Kennedy gone and Kavanaugh in his place , the Court \u2019 s decisions on issues where Kennedy has been a down-the-line conservative \u2014 like campaign finance and corruption , most business regulation and voting cases , gun rights , religious liberty , etc . \u2014 likely won \u2019 t change . There \u2019 s already a 5-4 conservative majority on those , so conservative rulings like the ones Kennedy wrote or joined in DC v. Heller , Citizens United , or Hobby Lobby will continue apace .\nWhat will change are rulings on issues where Kennedy has helped maintain a shaky 5-4 center-left consensus and where Kavanaugh absolutely will not . Because of the Court \u2019 s longstanding principle of stare decisis , or obeying past precedent barring a compelling reason not to do so , some liberal Court achievements are likely to stay . But a Court without Kennedy and with Kavanaugh is substantially more likely to :\nOverturn Roe v. Wade and allow states ( and maybe the federal government too ) to ban most or all abortions .\nRule in favor of religious challenges to anti-discrimination law , and perhaps , in an extreme case , reverse some past Supreme Court rulings on gay rights .\nBar government actors from engaging in explicit race-based affirmative action .\nAnd there are likely to be more aftershocks that are hard to anticipate this far in advance .\nAn America after Anthony Kennedy and under Brett Kavanaugh looks significantly different from America before . The movement against mass incarceration could run into unprecedented resistance from the Court , and the anti-abortion movement could notch its greatest victories in a half-century .\nThis Supreme Court vacancy gave Donald Trump the power to shift jurisprudence on a range of critical issues . It could wind up being the most important part of his legacy .\nNothing is guaranteed , but Kavanaugh will be much likelier to join a decision overturning Roe v. Wade and giving states the ability to ban abortions as early as the first trimester .\nThis may take years after Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation ; a state would need to pass a law clearly incompatible with the Court \u2019 s existing approach to abortion rights and wait for the challenge to reach the Supreme Court before the new justice would have a chance to join a ruling . The anti-abortion movement might choose a more cautious strategy , instead chipping away at Roe with measures that fall short of outright bans . But with Kennedy gone , the votes for an outright reversal of Roe would probably be there .\nIt \u2019 s clear that Kavanaugh believes Roe was wrongly decided . In a speech last year to the American Enterprise Institute , Kavanaugh praised then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist \u2019 s dissent in Roe at length , saying that Rehnquist \u2019 s jurisprudence on substantive due process issues ( the constitutional theory that enabled the ruling for abortion rights in Roe ) \u201c help [ ed ] to ensure that the Court operates more as a court of law and less as an institution of social policy , \u201d even if Rehnquist didn \u2019 t succeed in preventing the majority decision in Roe or in overturning it .\nKavanaugh has also , as a federal judge , attempted to prevent a 17-year-old unauthorized immigrant from receiving an abortion , writing once his efforts were rebuffed by the full DC Circuit that the court had created \u201c a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. \u201d Such a right , he wrote , did not and should not exist .\nKavanaugh is not the pivotal justice on Roe , however ; that would be John Roberts , who in 1990 wrote a brief arguing that Roe was \u201c wrongly decided and should be overruled. \u201d But Roberts has nonetheless acted as chief justice to preserve laws he clearly has trouble with constitutionally ( like Obamacare ) for the sake of the court \u2019 s legitimacy . Roe could be the same .\nThen again , his gradual efforts to roll back the Voting Rights Act and public-sector unions , by contrast , are an example of his willingness to rock the boat to get a conservative outcome , as Irin Carmon details in the Washington Post . Maybe he \u2019 ll attempt the same strategy on abortion .\nYou can go back and forth on where Roberts will land seemingly forever . William Saletan at Slate has a piece making the case that Roe will survive , while UC Irvine constitutional law professor Leah Litman argues it \u2019 s done for .\nBut it \u2019 s worth asking what overturning Roe will look like if the Court does go that direction . There are two broad ways it could happen . The first is the overturn-without-overturning approach . The second is a full-on reversal .\nKavanaugh has , in the unauthorized immigrant minor case , already suggested what an overturn-without-overturning approach could look like . Not to be too hyperbolic , but he argued that literally keeping a girl in detention to keep her from getting an abortion was not an undue burden on her right to an abortion . That might seem implausible ( it certainly did to the rest of the DC Circuit ) , but it offers a pathway to allowing other extreme restrictions on abortion rights .\nThe 20-week abortion bans adopted by 21 states haven \u2019 t reached the Supreme Court yet . The Ninth Circuit overturned Arizona and Idaho \u2019 s bans , only for the Supreme Court to decline to hear an appeal . Under Roe , abortion bans before viability ( or about 24 weeks ) are generally unacceptable . But Kavanaugh and the court \u2019 s other conservatives could weaken that standard by taking up a 20-week ban and judging it to not be an undue burden on abortion rights .\nAfter that , a state could attempt a ban on abortions after a heartbeat is detected ( generally at week six of a pregnancy ) . That would be a dramatic escalation , but building on the 20-week decision , the conservatives could judge it to not be an undue burden . After Roe has been duly chipped away at , an outright reversal would look more plausible .\nBut it \u2019 s also possible the Supreme Court will hear a case about an outright ban before it has time to gradually weaken Roe . As Carmon notes , states have been adopting a wide array of abortion restrictions , from ones that clearly violate Roe and would set up an outright challenge to it , to ones that could be upheld without junking Roe and Casey entirely .\nMississippi recently approved a 15-week abortion ban ( already blocked in federal court ) ; Kentucky passed a ban applying to dilation-and-evacuation abortions after 11 weeks and Ohio and South Carolina are weighing \u201c total prohibitions. \u201d Just this past May , Iowa adopted a law banning abortions after fetal heartbeats , which again , usually occur at six weeks of pregnancy .\nThe passage of heartbeat bans or total bans on abortion at the state level will almost certainly lead federal appeals courts to overturn them , and if the conservatives on the Supreme Court don \u2019 t want to fully overturn yet , they can simply decline to hear the case .\nBut a conservative Court of Appeals panel could rogue and decide to disobey Roe and Casey . ( This would most likely happen after the post-Kavanaugh Court allows some less dramatic regulations like a 20-week ban to go forward , after which the circuit judges could argue that Roe and Casey no longer apply in the wake of more recent Supreme Court jurisprudence . ) Then the Supreme Court would likely be forced to take up the issue .\nThis is what happened in 2014 to 2015 with same-sex marriage : Circuit courts split on the issue , forcing the Supreme Court to resolve the disagreement .\nThat eventuality would bring the possibility of overturning Roe entirely to the Court \u2019 s door , and it would have little choice but to hear the case . After that point , all bets are off .\nAnd this all could happen quite rapidly . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Anna North explains , there are already 13 abortion cases before federal circuit courts this year , which could reach the Supreme Court afterwards . Any one of them could be the effective or explicit end of Roe .\nWith Kennedy , there was a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court for sharply limiting solitary confinement in America . With Kavanaugh in Kennedy \u2019 s place , that majority has evaporated , likely replaced with a harder-line majority that could preserve the practice .\nIn 2015 , Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in Davis v. Ayala , a death-penalty case in which the Court ( joined by Kennedy ) sided against the defendant . Nevertheless , Kennedy used his concurrence to unleash a bracing jeremiad against the evils of solitary confinement , in which the defendant had been held for most of his 25-plus years in prison .\n\u201d Research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago : Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price , \u201d Kennedy wrote . \u201c In a case that presented the issue , the judiciary may be required , within its proper jurisdiction and authority , to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist , and , if so , whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them . \u201d\nThe implication was clear : Kennedy wanted advocates to bring a case challenging the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement on the grounds that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment . He basically dared them to , and suggested that if such a case reached the Court , he \u2019 d be inclined to limit the practice .\nSharon Dolovich , a law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the university \u2019 s Prison Law & Policy Program , told me in 2016 that solitary confinement was the \u201c one major unresolved issue \u201d in criminal justice \u201c that is definitely going to come up \u201d in the next few years .\nIt \u2019 s a long time coming . At any given moment , about 80,000 to 100,000 people are held in solitary confinement in the US ; in many states , the average stint in solitary lasts years . And it \u2019 s been that way at least since the 1980s , without any federal court intervention to halt it .\n\u201d There \u2019 s so much data now \u2014 physiological data , psychological data , reentry data \u2014 there \u2019 s so much data making clear the extended physical , psychological , and emotional trauma that people suffer in extended solitary confinement , it would be so easy for the Court just to point to it all and conclude there \u2019 s an objective harm , \u201d Dolovich said .\nJonathan Simon , a law professor and director of the Center for the Study of Law and Society at UC Berkeley , also speaking in 2016 , told me that solitary confinement is on \u201c the verge of being found unconstitutional , at least in its most excessive forms. \u201d Just what \u201c excessive \u201d means there is , naturally , a matter of debate , and Simon cautions that the Court could err on the side of giving prisons too much leeway .\nHe noted that Ashker v. Brown , a recent case challenging solitary confinement in California that ended in a settlement rather than reaching the Supreme Court , \u201c involved a class of inmates that had been held more than 10 years , and the settlement will still allow people to be held up to five years , and even after that they can still be held in solitary if they \u2019 re given programming and special services. \u201d By contrast , the United Nations special rapporteur on torture has called for an absolute ban on solitary confinement lasting 15 days or more . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure Kennedy or any justice would go nearly that far , \u201d Simon says .\nBut without Kennedy on the Court , a ruling going even as far as a five-year maximum becomes less likely .\nSolitary confinement is not the only case where a more conservative justice could make a difference . In 2011 , Kennedy wrote a 5-4 decision upholding a lower court order mandating that California release tens of thousands of prisoners to reduce overcrowding , which the state itself admitted was unconstitutional . It was , Simon told me , \u201c the first prisoners \u2019 rights decision to come down in favor of the prisoner in a long time . It ended mass incarceration in California . \u201d\nKennedy was also the best hope that opponents of capital punishment had for a ruling against the practice , even though he \u2019 s often sided with conservatives in past death penalty cases on the constitutionality of , say , using a particular lethal injection method .\nBack in 2016 , Simon told me that he was \u201c somewhat optimistic \u201d that Kennedy would join with Breyer and Ginsburg ( who have already declared their belief that capital punishment is across-the-board unconstitutional ) , Sotomayor , and Kagan in an anti-death penalty case . \u201c The reason \u2026 goes back to his interest in dignity , \u201d Simon said . \u201c The strongest of the opinions in Furman \u201d \u2014 the 1972 case that briefly abolished capital punishment \u2014 \u201c was William Brennan \u2019 s , and Brennan based it most directly on human dignity . He argued the Eighth Amendment bans any punishment you can \u2019 t carry out without respecting the dignity of those being punished . \u201d\nKennedy leaned heavily on the importance of dignity in Brown v. Plata , the California prison overcrowding case . Simon even found an early Kennedy opinion from when he was a circuit court judge in the 1970s in which he quoted Brennan \u2019 s concurrence in Furman at length .\nEven if Kennedy didn \u2019 t buy a dignity argument for abolishing the death penalty , Simon said he thought Kennedy would be swayed by the issue of delays , which Breyer raised in his 2015 anti-capital punishment dissent . Legal delays were the entire reason for the prisoner \u2019 s stay in solitary confinement that Kennedy assailed in his concurrence last year .\n\u201d [ Kennedy ] came and gave a talk at Berkeley Law about a year and a half ago , and one of my colleagues was rude enough to ask him point blank whether he thought the death penalty was compatible with human dignity , \u201d Simon told me . \u201c Of course he declined to answer , but he said kind of cryptically , \u2018 Here in California you guys take so long enough to execute people that we may not even need to reach that cliff . \u2019 \u201d\nThis is all moot now that Kennedy is gone , replaced by a more doctrinaire law-and-order conservative in Kavanaugh .\nHaving Kennedy off the bench will also prevent incremental steps against capital punishment from going forward . In 2008 , Kennedy wrote for a 5-4 liberal majority that it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on people convicted merely of rape , not murder .\nThe status quo is especially likely to hold given the records of Kavanaugh and of Roberts , the new median justice . According to SCOTUSBlog \u2019 s Edith Roberts , Kavanaugh has \u201c tended to rule against defendants \u201d in criminal cases ; he lacks much of a record on capital punishment and solitary confinement , however .\nRoberts has vocally defended lethal injection from the bench and declined to join Kennedy \u2019 s anti-solitary confinement concurrence . He has shown occasional glimmers of a willingness to limit the death penalty and life imprisonment , when juvenile defendants and racially biased witnesses are involved , but in general is a much more hostile figure for opponents of mass incarceration and capital punishment than Kennedy has been .\nAnthony Kennedy was hardly an uncritical supporter of affirmative action in public employment , education admissions , or other realms .\nIn 2003 , he dissented in Grutter v. Bollinger , a case in which O \u2019 Connor and the Court \u2019 s liberals ruled that the University of Michigan Law School \u2019 s racial affirmative action system was constitutional , and not an unconstitutional quota system . In 2007 \u2019 s Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No . 1 , he was the swing vote behind a ruling holding that Seattle , Washington , and Louisville , Kentucky \u2019 s voluntary desegregation programs were unconstitutional .\nIn 2009 \u2019 s Ricci v. DeStefano , he ruled that New Haven , Connecticut \u2019 s Fire Department discriminated against white applicants for promotions . He wrote the controlling opinion in 2014 \u2019 s Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action , which upheld Michigan \u2019 s ban on affirmative action .\nBut he was not an implacable foe of the practice , either . In his Grutter dissent , he echoed Justice Lewis Powell , who held Kennedy \u2019 s seat before him and wrote the controlling opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , a 1978 case in which the Court held that affirmative action was constitutional but explicit quotas ( \u201c 16 of the 100 students must be black \u201d ) went too far .\n\u201c There is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity , but an educational institution must ensure , through sufficient procedures , that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decision-making , \u201d Kennedy wrote in the Grutter dissent .\nThis position of his became additionally relevant with 2016 \u2019 s Fisher v. University of Texas , in which he wrote a majority opinion defending the University of Texas \u2019 s use of race in admissions . With Fisher , he effectively became the one vote holding together the Court \u2019 s majority defending affirmative action in at least some cases .\nA more stalwart conservative in Kavanaugh now takes Kennedy \u2019 s place . In 1999 , Kavanaugh wrote an amicus brief for the anti-affirmative action Center for Equal Opportunity arguing that Hawaii \u2019 s law only allowing Native Hawaiians to vote for officials of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs was unconstitutional ( the Supreme Court agreed ) . The Court agreed , 7-2 , but the fact that Kavanaugh teamed up with the Center is a strong indication of his views on affirmative action more broadly .\nAfter a Kennedy-for-Kavanaugh swap , it \u2019 s likely that the uneasy affirmative action consensus will buckle , and a ruling finally doing away with public affirmative action programs will come .\nArguably , Kennedy \u2019 s greatest legacy on the Court \u2014 and certainly what he hopes will be his greatest legacy \u2014 are his decisions expanding the scope of LGBTQ rights .\nIn 1996 \u2019 s Romer v. Evans , he authored the Court \u2019 s first major pro-gay rights decision , invoking the 14th Amendment \u2019 s Equal Protection Clause in striking down a Colorado state constitutional amendment that prevented cities and towns from adopting their own bans on discrimination against gays , lesbians , or bisexuals .\nSeven years later , in 2003 \u2019 s Lawrence v. Texas , Kennedy wrote a 6-3 decision invalidating Texas \u2019 s ban on oral and anal sex between two men or two women . That decision overrode 1986 \u2019 s Bowers v. Hardwick , a decision upholding Georgia \u2019 s sodomy law . In Lawrence , Kennedy tellingly did not use equal protection reasoning but instead found that any bans on consensual sexual behavior between adults , regardless of the genders involved , violate the due process clause \u2019 s guarantee of personal liberty . ( This was similar to the reasoning the Court had used in Roe and to invalidate bans on contraception in Griswold v . Connecticut . )\nA decade later , in 2013 , Kennedy wrote the 5-4 decision in United States v. Windsor overturning the federal Defense of Marriage Act on equal protection grounds . The decision required the federal government to respect and honor same-sex marriages at the state level , while still allowing states to ban same-sex marriage if they wished . And two years after that , in 2015 \u2019 s Obergefell v. Hodges , he swept away bans on same-sex marriage altogether , ending with a stirring tribute to the value of marriage that \u2019 s become a mainstay of wedding readings in the years since :\nNo union is more profound than marriage , for it embodies the highest ideals of love , fidelity , devotion , sacrifice , and family . In forming a marital union , two people become something greater than once they were . As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate , marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death . It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage . Their plea is that they do respect it , respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves . Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness , excluded from one of civilization \u2019 s oldest institutions . They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law . The Constitution grants them that right .\nIt is fair , then , for gay rights advocates to worry about what could happen to the Obergefell precedent now that Kennedy has retired and will be replaced by Kavanaugh , who is opposed by every LGBT rights group you can imagine .\nThere are certainly some conservatives on the Court who are interested in chipping away at the ruling \u2019 s guarantees . Gorsuch , Thomas , and Alito in 2017 dissented from a ruling requiring Arkansas to list same-sex parents on their children \u2019 s birth certificates , arguing that to do so does not violate Obergefell . That , Slate \u2019 s Mark Joseph Stern argued , set the stage for a legal strategy based on gradually chipping away at the right to marriage until it \u2019 s practically worthless .\n\u201c [ John ] Roberts would be free to rewrite Windsor and Obergefell however he wants , \u201d Stern writes . \u201c Roberts could remain faithful to the original text of both decisions . He could also reverse them . But the likeliest possibility is that Roberts first cuts them down to a single guarantee\u2014the right for same-sex couples to receive a marriage license with no attendant privileges . In case after case , Roberts could vote to allow discrimination against same-sex couples but affirm their right to the license itself . \u201d\nThe trouble with this argument is that we don \u2019 t actually know where Roberts stands on the precedential value of Obergefell . He didn \u2019 t register a dissent in the Arkansas case the way his conservative colleagues did ; it \u2019 s possible he dissented without letting that dissent be recorded , but it \u2019 s also possible he sided with the liberals .\nMoreover , majorities of Americans in 44 of the 50 states now support same-sex marriage . The overwhelming public opinion shift in favor of marriage equality might make Roberts more hesitant to chip away at the right , and it also might deny the Court opportunities to take up the issue , if the popularity of same-sex marriage prevents states from trying to restrict the right in ways that would be challenged and make it to the Court .\nMy hunch is that LGBTQ rights are the part of Kennedy \u2019 s legacy least likely to be sacrificed once he \u2019 s gone . But certainly a Court without Kennedy , and with Kavanaugh , will be less friendly to LGBTQ causes than one with Kennedy still around .",

The movement against mass incarceration could run into unprecedented resistance from the Court, and the anti-abortion movement could notch its greatest victories in a half-century.\n\nThis Supreme Court vacancy gave Donald Trump the power to shift jurisprudence on a range of critical issues. It could wind up being the most important part of his legacy.\n\nAbortion under Kavanaugh\n\nNothing is guaranteed, but Kavanaugh will be much likelier to join a decision overturning Roe v.

William Saletan at Slate has a piece making the case that Roe will survive, while UC Irvine constitutional law professor Leah Litman argues it\u2019s done for.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth asking what overturning Roe will look like if the Court does go that direction.

Nevertheless, Kennedy used his concurrence to unleash a bracing jeremiad against the evils of solitary confinement, in which the defendant had been held for most of his 25-plus years in prison.\n\n\u201dResearch still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cIn a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.\u201d\n\nThe implication was clear: Kennedy wanted advocates to bring a case challenging the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement on the grounds that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He basically dared them to, and suggested that if such a case reached the Court, he\u2019d be inclined to limit the practice.\n\nSharon Dolovich, a law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the university\u2019s Prison Law & Policy Program, told me in 2016 that solitary confinement was the \u201cone major unresolved issue\u201d in criminal justice \u201cthat is definitely going to come up\u201d in the next few years.\n\nIt\u2019s a long time coming. At any given moment, about 80,000 to 100,000 people are held in solitary confinement in the US; in many states, the average stint in solitary lasts years. And it\u2019s been that way at least since the 1980s, without any federal court intervention to halt it.\n\n\u201dThere\u2019s so much data now \u2014 physiological data, psychological data, reentry data \u2014 there\u2019s so much data making clear the extended physical, psychological, and emotional trauma that people suffer in extended solitary confinement, it would be so easy for the Court just to point to it all and conclude there\u2019s an objective harm,\u201d Dolovich said.\n\nJonathan Simon, a law professor and director of the Center for the Study of Law and Society at UC Berkeley, also speaking in 2016, told me that solitary confinement is on \u201cthe verge of being found unconstitutional, at least in its most excessive forms.\u201d Just what \u201cexcessive\u201d means there is, naturally, a matter of debate, and Simon cautions that the Court could err on the side of giving prisons too much leeway.\n\nHe noted that Ashker v. Brown, a recent case challenging solitary confinement in California that ended in a settlement rather than reaching the Supreme Court, \u201cinvolved a class of inmates that had been held more than 10 years, and the settlement will still allow people to be held up to five years, and even after that they can still be held in solitary if they\u2019re given programming and special services.\u201d By contrast, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture has called for an absolute ban on solitary confinement lasting 15 days or more. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Kennedy or any justice would go nearly that far,\u201d Simon says.\n\nBut without Kennedy on the Court, a ruling going even as far as a five-year maximum becomes less likely.\n\nSolitary confinement is not the only case where a more conservative justice could make a difference. In 2011, Kennedy wrote a 5-4 decision upholding a lower court order mandating that California release tens of thousands of prisoners to reduce overcrowding, which the state itself admitted was unconstitutional. It was, Simon told me, \u201cthe first prisoners\u2019 rights decision to come down in favor of the prisoner in a long time. It ended mass incarceration in California.\u201d\n\nKennedy was also the best hope that opponents of capital punishment had for a ruling against the practice, even though he\u2019s often sided with conservatives in past death penalty cases on the constitutionality of, say, using a particular lethal injection method.\n\nBack in 2016, Simon told me that he was \u201csomewhat optimistic\u201d that Kennedy would join with Breyer and Ginsburg (who have already declared their belief that capital punishment is across-the-board unconstitutional), Sotomayor, and Kagan in an anti-death penalty case. \u201cThe reason \u2026 goes back to his interest in dignity,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThe strongest of the opinions in Furman\u201d \u2014 the 1972 case that briefly abolished capital punishment \u2014 \u201cwas William Brennan\u2019s, and Brennan based it most directly on human dignity. He argued the Eighth Amendment bans any punishment you can\u2019t carry out without respecting the dignity of those being punished.\u201d\n\nKennedy leaned heavily on the importance of dignity in Brown v. Plata, the California prison overcrowding case. Simon even found an early Kennedy opinion from when he was a circuit court judge in the 1970s in which he quoted Brennan\u2019s concurrence in Furman at length.\n\nEven if Kennedy didn\u2019t buy a dignity argument for abolishing the death penalty, Simon said he thought Kennedy would be swayed by the issue of delays, which Breyer raised in his 2015 anti-capital punishment dissent. Legal delays were the entire reason for the prisoner\u2019s stay in solitary confinement that Kennedy assailed in his concurrence last year.\n\n\u201d[Kennedy] came and gave a talk at Berkeley Law about a year and a half ago, and one of my colleagues was rude enough to ask him point blank whether he thought the death penalty was compatible with human dignity,\u201d Simon told me. \u201cOf course he declined to answer, but he said kind of cryptically, \u2018Here in California you guys take so long enough to execute people that we may not even need to reach that cliff.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is all moot now that Kennedy is gone, replaced by a more doctrinaire law-and-order conservative in Kavanaugh.\n\nHaving Kennedy off the bench will also prevent incremental steps against capital punishment from going forward. In 2008, Kennedy wrote for a 5-4 liberal majority that it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on people convicted merely of rape, not murder.\n\nThe status quo is especially likely to hold given the records of Kavanaugh and of Roberts, the new median justice. According to SCOTUSBlog\u2019s Edith Roberts, Kavanaugh has \u201ctended to rule against defendants\u201d in criminal cases; he lacks much of a record on capital punishment and solitary confinement, however.\n\nRoberts has vocally defended lethal injection from the bench and declined to join Kennedy\u2019s anti-solitary confinement concurrence. He has shown occasional glimmers of a willingness to limit the death penalty and life imprisonment, when juvenile defendants and racially biased witnesses are involved, but in general is a much more hostile figure for opponents of mass incarceration and capital punishment than Kennedy has been.\n\nAffirmative action in America under Kavanaugh\n\nAnthony Kennedy was hardly an uncritical supporter of affirmative action in public employment, education admissions, or other realms.\n\nIn 2003, he dissented in Grutter v. Bollinger, a case in which O\u2019Connor and the Court\u2019s liberals ruled that the University of Michigan Law School\u2019s racial affirmative action system was constitutional, and not an unconstitutional quota system. In 2007\u2019s Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, he was the swing vote behind a ruling holding that Seattle, Washington, and Louisville, Kentucky\u2019s voluntary desegregation programs were unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2009\u2019s Ricci v. DeStefano, he ruled that New Haven, Connecticut\u2019s Fire Department discriminated against white applicants for promotions. He wrote the controlling opinion in 2014\u2019s Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, which upheld Michigan\u2019s ban on affirmative action.\n\nBut he was not an implacable foe of the practice, either. In his Grutter dissent, he echoed Justice Lewis Powell, who held Kennedy\u2019s seat before him and wrote the controlling opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a 1978 case in which the Court held that affirmative action was constitutional but explicit quotas (\u201c16 of the 100 students must be black\u201d) went too far.\n\n\u201cThere is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity, but an educational institution must ensure, through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decision-making,\u201d Kennedy wrote in the Grutter dissent.\n\nThis position of his became additionally relevant with 2016\u2019s Fisher v. University of Texas, in which he wrote a majority opinion defending the University of Texas\u2019s use of race in admissions. With Fisher, he effectively became the one vote holding together the Court\u2019s majority defending affirmative action in at least some cases.\n\nA more stalwart conservative in Kavanaugh now takes Kennedy\u2019s place. In 1999, Kavanaugh wrote an amicus brief for the anti-affirmative action Center for Equal Opportunity arguing that Hawaii\u2019s law only allowing Native Hawaiians to vote for officials of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs was unconstitutional (the Supreme Court agreed). The Court agreed, 7-2, but the fact that Kavanaugh teamed up with the Center is a strong indication of his views on affirmative action more broadly.\n\nAfter a Kennedy-for-Kavanaugh swap, it\u2019s likely that the uneasy affirmative action consensus will buckle, and a ruling finally doing away with public affirmative action programs will come.\n\nGay rights in America under Kavanaugh\n\nArguably, Kennedy\u2019s greatest legacy on the Court \u2014 and certainly what he hopes will be his greatest legacy \u2014 are his decisions expanding the scope of LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn 1996\u2019s Romer v. Evans, he authored the Court\u2019s first major pro-gay rights decision, invoking the 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause in striking down a Colorado state constitutional amendment that prevented cities and towns from adopting their own bans on discrimination against gays, lesbians, or bisexuals.\n\nSeven years later, in 2003\u2019s Lawrence v. Texas, Kennedy wrote a 6-3 decision invalidating Texas\u2019s ban on oral and anal sex between two men or two women. That decision overrode 1986\u2019s Bowers v. Hardwick, a decision upholding Georgia\u2019s sodomy law. In Lawrence, Kennedy tellingly did not use equal protection reasoning but instead found that any bans on consensual sexual behavior between adults, regardless of the genders involved, violate the due process clause\u2019s guarantee of personal liberty. (This was similar to the reasoning the Court had used in Roe and to invalidate bans on contraception in Griswold v. Connecticut.)\n\nA decade later, in 2013, Kennedy wrote the 5-4 decision in United States v. Windsor overturning the federal Defense of Marriage Act on equal protection grounds. The decision required the federal government to respect and honor same-sex marriages at the state level, while still allowing states to ban same-sex marriage if they wished. And two years after that, in 2015\u2019s Obergefell v. Hodges, he swept away bans on same-sex marriage altogether, ending with a stirring tribute to the value of marriage that\u2019s become a mainstay of wedding readings in the years since:\n\nNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization\u2019s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\nIt is fair, then, for gay rights advocates to worry about what could happen to the Obergefell precedent now that Kennedy has retired and will be replaced by Kavanaugh, who is opposed by every LGBT rights group you can imagine.\n\nThere are certainly some conservatives on the Court who are interested in chipping away at the ruling\u2019s guarantees. Gorsuch, Thomas, and Alito in 2017 dissented from a ruling requiring Arkansas to list same-sex parents on their children\u2019s birth certificates, arguing that to do so does not violate Obergefell. That, Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern argued, set the stage for a legal strategy based on gradually chipping away at the right to marriage until it\u2019s practically worthless.\n\n\u201c[John] Roberts would be free to rewrite Windsor and Obergefell however he wants,\u201d Stern writes. \u201cRoberts could remain faithful to the original text of both decisions. He could also reverse them. But the likeliest possibility is that Roberts first cuts them down to a single guarantee\u2014the right for same-sex couples to receive a marriage license with no attendant privileges. In case after case, Roberts could vote to allow discrimination against same-sex couples but affirm their right to the license itself.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with this argument is that we don\u2019t actually know where Roberts stands on the precedential value of Obergefell. He didn\u2019t register a dissent in the Arkansas case the way his conservative colleagues did; it\u2019s possible he dissented without letting that dissent be recorded, but it\u2019s also possible he sided with the liberals.\n\nMoreover, majorities of Americans in 44 of the 50 states now support same-sex marriage. The overwhelming public opinion shift in favor of marriage equality might make Roberts more hesitant to chip away at the right, and it also might deny the Court opportunities to take up the issue, if the popularity of same-sex marriage prevents states from trying to restrict the right in ways that would be challenged and make it to the Court.\n\nMy hunch is that LGBTQ rights are the part of Kennedy\u2019s legacy least likely to be sacrificed once he\u2019s gone. But certainly a Court without Kennedy, and with Kavanaugh, will be less friendly to LGBTQ causes than one with Kennedy still around.",
