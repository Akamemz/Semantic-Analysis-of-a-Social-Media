His closest allies say the same .\nBut the prominent Donald Trump adversary is publishing a book titled after a prominent 2016 speech he gave opposing Trump : `` Two Paths : America Divided or United . '' Almost immediately after it 's released later this month , he plans to return to the early voting state of New Hampshire during his book tour .\nBetween that and a series of aggressive political moves embarked on by Kasich and his advisers , the whispers among Republican insiders about a possible primary challenge to the president won \u2019 t go away no matter how hard he tries to dismiss them .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not really interested in running for political office again , \u201d the term-limited governor said on CNN last week when asked directly about his intentions . \u201c You don \u2019 t close the door on anything , but I have \u2014 I don \u2019 t have my eyes on that . \u201d\nThat less-than-Shermanesque answer helps explain why the speculation continues to linger .
