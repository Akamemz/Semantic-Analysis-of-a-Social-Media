A Change.org petition demanding that Robertson be reinstated and the network issue an apology was steadily climbing toward 100,000 signatures Friday .\nA separate petition at a website called IStandWithPhil.com makes a similar appeal . Hosted by the online community Faith Driven Consumers , the website helps its members spend their money with companies that fall in line with their spiritual beliefs . The petition on IStandWithPhil.com had surpassed 130,000 signatures by Friday evening .\nThose who 've signed the IStandWithPhil.com petition are asking for their `` views ( to ) be treated with equality and respect in America 's rich rainbow of diversity , '' and for the `` network to immediately reinstate Mr. Robertson to 'Duck Dynasty , ' and to formally apologize to him , his family , and the millions of viewers who tune in every week , stand by him , and share his worldview . ''\n`` While the LGBT community may be offended by his opposing viewpoint , '' that webstite continues , `` your rash , discriminatory , and unfair treatment toward Mr. Robertson -- a recognized symbol of the faith community -- is a slap in the face to Faith Driven Consumers and everyday Americans alike .
