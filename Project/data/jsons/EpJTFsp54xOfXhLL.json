    "content": "There \u2019 s already been plenty of ink spilled in response to Robert McCulloch \u2019 s rambling , evasive , tone-deaf speech announcing no indictment in Darren Wilson \u2019 s shooting of Michael Brown . It has been pointed out how incredibly rare it is for grand juries to not deliver an indictment , period , much less a case in which no one disputes an unarmed man was shot dead in front of witnesses , and how unusual it is for a prosecutor to appear pleased and satisfied with his own failure to obtain an indictment .\nIt \u2019 s hard not to comment on torturedly noncommittal turns of phrase like \u201c Darren Wilson caused the death of Michael Brown by shooting him , \u201d or \u201c For how many years have we been talking about the issues that lead to incidents like this ? \u201d , in an effort to avoid the appearance of downplaying the seriousness of what took place while still downplaying the seriousness of what took place .\nNo , the part that grabbed my attention was the part that wasn \u2019 t unusual at all . The refrain that I hear over , and over , and over again .\nMcCulloch could hardly pretend all was well in Ferguson , that there wasn \u2019 t a serious sickness suffusing the community that needed to be addressed . And he refused to lay responsibility for that sickness at the feet of the inherent racism of the society we all live in , or the corruption and brutality of the Ferguson police department , or even specifically the man who chose to put six bullets in an unarmed teenager .\nAnd of course it would be impolitic to blame the grieving , furious residents of Ferguson or the protesters who \u2019 d come to join them in solidarity . McCulloch even , confusingly , encouraged them to \u201c continue the demonstrations \u201d at the end of a speech where he argued , at length , that the rallying cause of the demonstrations was specious and Officer Wilson did nothing wrong .\nSo instead he did what everyone does . He blamed the media .\nI grew up among conservative evangelical Christians . Blaming the media is old hat , a tired reflex . Any time something bad happens , The Media gets the requisite ritual excoriation for \u201c making the problem worse , \u201d right up there with The Lawyers and The Politicians .\nThe obnoxious meddling journalist is a stock character in fiction . Every movie that \u2019 s about someone wealthy , politically powerful or of royal blood\u2014which is a disproportionate number of movies\u2014has a scene where the protagonist waves off a horde of microphone-wielding reporters while trying to go about their business .\nWe nerds , especially , with our inherent distrust of social situations , love to make \u201c the press \u201d the enemy of our heroes . Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson . Harry Potter and Rita Skeeter . Commander Shepard and Khalisah Bint Sinan al-Jilani . Smart , introverted people are naturally predisposed to see public opinion as a nuisance at best , a threat at worst , and to think that everything would run better if the people in charge were just left alone to do their jobs without worrying about \u201c popularity contests . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a clich\u00e9 . You can summon up the requisite phrases in your sleep . \u201c Taking things out of context. \u201d \u201c Making mountains out of molehills. \u201d \u201c Spinning a narrative. \u201d \u201c Ginning up controversy . \u201d\nMcCulloch was a little more 21st-century , referencing \u201c the 24-hour news cycle \u201d and , of course , the one thing Everyone Knows is even worse than The Media , social media .\nIf only those gossips and busybodies on Twitter had kept their mouths shut . If only there weren \u2019 t so many viral images of the victim smiling at the camera , of protesters being gassed , of police officers driving around in armored vehicles dressed as stormtroopers .\nIf only there hadn \u2019 t been trending hashtags like # IfTheyGunnedMeDown or # BlackLivesMatter .\nIf only this story hadn \u2019 t gone national . If only all the interlopers had just shut up and let the local authorities go about their usual business of shooting unarmed black citizens with no consequences for the shooter .\nIt \u2019 s a pattern that \u2019 s become especially noticeable this year . I \u2019 ve heard 2014 called The Year of the Angry White Man but it \u2019 s even more The Year of the Angry Man Who Blamed the Media . Chris Christie blamed the media . Rob Ford blamed the media . Even President Obama , bleeding popularity and under attack from the Left and the Right , blames the media .\nDonald Sterling blamed the media . Adrian Peterson blamed the media . Both Ray and , disturbingly , Janae Rice blamed the media .\nAmazon blamed the media . Uber blamed the media , decided to try to destroy journalists \u2019 lives in response and then blamed the media for the backlash to that . # GamerGate , that lovable amorphous mob of Internet haters , blames the media for pretty much everything .\nAnd , in the evergreen field of men in the public eye denying rape allegations , we have Bill Cosby continuing a blame-the-media campaign he \u2019 s had going for over a decade and finally seeing it start to run out of steam . And Jian Ghomeshi , who took the interesting PR tactic of \u201c getting out in front of the issue \u201d by pre-emptively blaming the media before the media had even said anything .\nThe lesson of this year seems to be that if someone seems to be very huffy and resentful of \u201c the press , \u201d it means they most likely did something horrible that , soon , the press is going to reveal .\nNow , I \u2019 m not giving some kind of unequivocal defense of the media . Journalists aren \u2019 t saints . They \u2019 re not even , as a class , particularly good people . I \u2019 ve read my history , I know about William Randolph Hearst , the Maine and the Spanish-American War\u2014I even know about Scott McClellan , the White House press corps , and the Iraq War .\nThe history of journalism is filled with hoaxes , sensationalism , and widespread misconceptions . Journalists are , after all , only human beings driven by a profit motive like the rest of us , and like the rest of us are constrained and controlled by the real power-brokers of our society all too easily .\nAnd yet . You can talk about a political \u201c bias \u201d or \u201c slant \u201d in the press but the main thing the press wants , like any other business institution , is profit\u2014is to make money by sniffing out the stories people are attracted to , that they want to hear . And it \u2019 s quite true that the fallible men and women of the press all too often earn their paycheck with rumors or slander or yellow journalism that feeds prejudice\u2026Mostly what attracts the hounds from the press is if it genuinely seems like someone really did commit a horrible offense .\nAnd if it looks like a horrible offense and quacks like a horrible offense and lays eggs like a horrible offense\u2026 I don \u2019 t believe that the sheer volume of scandals filling up our RSS feeds is because the press has somehow become nastier or more scurrilous in the past few years . It \u2019 s mostly just that , thanks to technology , there \u2019 s more press able to be in more places for more of the time .\nAll the press is is people like you and me asking the questions you and I would ask about the disturbing situations in our society if we could , if we weren \u2019 t burdened by our daily responsibilities and our distance from the situation . The stories we hear\u2014that politicians abuse their power in petty ways and go back on their promises ; that arrogant young millionaires break rules and mistreat employees and competitors ; that powerful men threaten , harass and abuse women with impunity ; that black men get gunned down in the street by police and no one bats an eye\u2014none of these are , really , news . They \u2019 re all stories as old as time . The \u201c 24-hour news cycle \u201d just makes them harder to sweep under the rug and ignore .\nI am all for criticizing the press , and demanding that we get more depth to a story than a sensationalistic headline . But all too often the people who reflexively \u201c blame the media \u201d with vague insinuations that the negative attention focused on them is slanderous are just throwing up a smokescreen for a story that becomes more and more damning the more facts come out\u2014as the crisis management firm Jian Ghomeshi hired learned , too late . As , for me , has been true the more facts I learn about Ferguson .\nDo you want to challenge a media narrative with more facts , more evidence , with a more compelling narrative ? I will applaud you all the way .\nBut I am done with the world-weary sigh that \u201c the media \u201d is always getting things wrong , to \u201c never believe what you read in the papers , \u201d that \u201c sensationalistic journalism \u201d is ruining everything . To paraphrase C.S . Lewis , I \u2019 m sick and tired of the flippant rhetorical stance that rejects any \u201c sensationalistic \u201d story with world-weary cynicism as though the refutation has already been made .\nBecause it was the \u201c sensationalistic \u201d media that helped put a stop to the Vietnam War , that rallied the nation behind the civil rights marches in the 1960s . It has always been the power of \u201c the media , \u201d in its various forms , to brutally , shockingly force us to confront head-on things we had previously accepted as distant , vague everyday realities .\nAlthough the cynical \u201c ignore the media \u201d attitude I \u2019 m talking about exists all over the political spectrum , it \u2019 s not a coincidence that its most common manifestation is among conservatives who sneer at the \u201c liberal media \u201d and the \u201c liberal agenda . \u201d\nThe ultimate effect of telling people to ignore the media , to ignore the latest shocks and outrages , to turn off the TV and close Twitter and go about your business\u2014well , it \u2019 s a conservative stance . It \u2019 s telling people to trust that the people in charge know what they \u2019 re doing , that the system basically works and the status quo is basically okay .\n\u201c Blaming the media \u201d for always distorting the story , for making a big deal out of minor misunderstandings , for drawing attention to things that \u201c aren \u2019 t any of their business \u201d \u2014it \u2019 s the favorite rhetorical trick of powerful people who want to be left to continue doing what they were doing .\nSure , the media frequently make terrible mistakes . But a kneejerk rejection of \u201c the media \u201d and a demand for those of us in the audience to \u201c mind our own business \u201d is an implicit statement that the people the media make miserable\u2014business owners , politicians , police chiefs , celebrities\u2014don \u2019 t make mistakes . It \u2019 s an implicit call to trust them to do the right thing without fear of external scrutiny .\nAnd there \u2019 s a lot of classes of people who hate the idea of being scrutinized by the unwashed masses and having to explain themselves to them , from narcissistic celebrities to patrician local aristocrats .\nThe introverted self-proclaimed \u201c disruptive \u201d geniuses of the tech world are just the latest group to discover how annoying it can be to have ordinary people question your decisions and how tempting it can be to try to shut them up .\nBen Franklin famously said that he \u2019 d rather have newspapers without democracy than democracy without newspapers\u2014but really , newspapers and democracy are both manifestations of the same phenomenon , of living in an egalitarian society where no one is rich enough or smart enough or respected enough to cruise through life without having to justify their actions to the other human beings they live with .\nAnd with the track record of public figures who go around decrying \u201c the media , \u201d the next time someone starts complaining about busybodies on Twitter or \u201c hit pieces \u201d on CNN , I \u2019 m going to raise an eyebrow .\nBecause the vague , deflecting pooh-poohing of \u201c the media \u201d is how Bill Cosby can have over a dozen women going on the record about his history of abuse and have people shrug their shoulders and decide it \u2019 s not their business . It \u2019 s how black teenagers and children can be gunned down by cops all over the country , every day , as a matter of public record and until one particular case goes viral thanks to those busybodies on Twitter white America treats it as business as usual .\nIt \u2019 s another manifestation of the numbing , enervating \u201c not-my-problem \u201d apathy that enables all the world \u2019 s ills to continue .\nSo sorry , Mr. McCulloch . There are a lot of specific criticisms of the culture of the \u201c 24-hour news cycle \u201d and \u201c social media \u201d I would agree with .\nBut when I hear you invoke the tired clich\u00e9s about how \u201c the media \u201d is making meddling busybodies of us all , I hear you telling me to trust you to do your job , to shrug my shoulders and go about my day confident that whatever \u2019 s happening in Missouri is someone else \u2019 s problem , to leave the status quo well enough alone .\nAnd maybe I \u2019 ve just seen one too many viral images of brutal murder gone unpunished , heard one too many lurid press accounts of rape and violation and injustice at which the world shrugged its shoulders and kept on walking . Maybe I , too , have been \u201c brainwashed by the media . \u201d",
