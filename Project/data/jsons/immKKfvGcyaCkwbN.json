(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nPresidential politics move fast. What we\u2019re watching heading into a new week on the 2020 campaign:\n\n___\n\nDays to general election: 176\n\n___\n\nTHE NARRATIVE\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s reelection is facing growing headwinds less than six months before Election Day.\n\nCoronavirus has breached the White House walls. The U.S. unemployment rate is at a 90-year high. And the death toll in the U.S. has surged past 80,000, far more than the Republican president\u2019s projections. Meanwhile, medical experts are warning of a major second wave of infections as states begin to reopen portions of their economies with Trump\u2019s blessing.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden has political challenges of his own, but no incumbent president has faced anything like this in almost a century.\n\n____\n\nTHE BIG QUESTIONS\n\nHas the U.S. economy hit bottom?\n\nJust a few short months ago, Trump planned to campaign for reelection on the back of a robust economy. That\u2019s a distant memory after more than 20 million jobs were lost in April, leading to an unemployment rate of 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression.\n\nEconomists suggest the genuine unemployment number is much higher. Trump is encouraging states to reopen their economies to help reverse the slide, even as health experts warn that reopening too soon could lead to a second wave that would wreak greater economic devastation.\n\nThe president needs things to start turning around quickly.\n\nCan Biden\u2019s campaign compete with the Death Star?\n\nHigh-profile Democrats have begun voicing public concerns over the direction of Biden\u2019s presidential campaign as Trump enjoys major organizational advantages.\n\nTrump has more money, a more sophisticated digital operation and a big staffing advantage. Last week, former Obama strategists David Axelrod and David Plouffe, in addition to Pete Buttigieg strategist Lis Smith, wrote separate op-eds offering their own suggestions for Biden\u2019s political strategy.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump campaign is unleashing a $10 million anti-Biden advertising blitz. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the massive round of attack ads represents the first major shot for what he called a juggernaut \u201cDeath Star\u201d campaign. Biden\u2019s team is supremely confident in his ability to compete, yet Democrats are decidedly playing catch-up.\n\nWill voters hold Trump accountable for the rising death toll?\n\nTrump and his allies have repeatedly declared success in the fight against the coronavirus, even as the U.S. death toll blows past his own projections.\n\nAs recently as April 20 Trump predicted during his daily press briefing that between 50,000 and 60,000 Americans would ultimately die as a result of COVID-19. The number of deaths has already exceeded 80,000. Trump has been forced to adjust his projections on the fly. He told a Fox News audience over the weekend that the final tally could reach 100,000 deaths. It\u2019s uncomfortable to think about the political ramifications of such horror, but the death toll represents one of the few pieces of quantitative evidence of Trump\u2019s job performance.\n\nAre the Obamas back?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama called Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus an \u201cabsolute chaotic disaster\u201d in a Friday conference call in which he encouraged his former team to embrace Biden\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nIt was Obama\u2019s latest step into the 2020 contest, albeit a modest one, having maintained regular private contact with Biden and other Democratic candidates in recent months.\n\nYet the former president\u2019s 2020 political star, at least for now, may be overshadowed by former first lady Michelle Obama, who starred in a Netflix documentary released last week exploring her life and rise in politics.\n\nCoinciding with the release, a new group emerged to encourage the former first lady to embrace a role as Biden\u2019s running mate. Michelle Obama has sent strong signals that she has no interest in returning to the White House. But even if she stands firm, the Obamas are reminding the political world that they still hold tremendous political power.\n\nHow do Democrats recalibrate their convention?\n\nBiden is the presumptive Democratic nominee. But the process of making it official is anything but settled.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s far from clear whether host site Milwaukee will be open for even a scaled-down convention, said Melissa Baldauff, a spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.\n\n\u201cWe are really just in a place where the disease sets the timeline,\u201d Baldauff said. \u201cEveryone would love to have the convention here in Milwaukee, even if it\u2019s in a limited capacity. But from our perspective, it\u2019s too soon to tell.\u201d\n\nA month ago, the state Supreme Court overruled Evers\u2019 order to reschedule the primary election, despite a shortage of election workers in Milwaukee that forced officials to slash the city\u2019s 180 polling places to just five.\n\nAt least 67 Wisconsin residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 after voting in person or working at the polls April 7, though it wasn\u2019t clear how many of the infections were direct results of the election, state officials said.\n\nAn important next step in the altered nominating process comes Tuesday, when the Democratic National Committee\u2019s powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee meets \u2014 virtually, of course \u2014 to discuss granting waivers to states that missed deadlines by postponing their primaries due to the pandemic.\n\nTHE FINAL THOUGHT\n\nHis campaign has massive organizational advantages, but they may not matter much if Trump cannot effectively govern the nation when it matters most. The death toll, unemployment and public confidence in his administration is moving in the wrong direction. Congress has passed multiple economic rescue packages already, but the president has yet to offer or execute a clear, comprehensive nationwide plan to take control of the health crisis.\n\n___\n\nCatch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast, \u201cGround Game.\u201d",
