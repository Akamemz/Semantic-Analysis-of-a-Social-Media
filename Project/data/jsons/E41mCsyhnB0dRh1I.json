Democrats took the Senate floor and spoke all night against DeVos , raising some damn good points :\n`` When presented with a nominee who says that public education is a 'dead end ' for students in this country , people take it personally , '' [ Sen. Chris Murphy ] said , referring to a 2015 speech given by DeVos . `` It hurts , because we all know that public schools can be better ... but we know it \u2019 s not a dead end ... Public education wasn \u2019 t a dead end for me . I get to be a United States senator because of the public education that I got . ''\nSen.

You \u2019 re just basically taking money away from public schools and giving it to private schools . ''\nDeVos would be a disaster , both intentionally\u2014because she wants to destroy public education by siphoning funding into private schools\u2014and because she simply doesn \u2019 t know what she \u2019 s doing and is not qualified for the job . If you have a Republican senator , now is the time to make one last effort to call and urge them to vote against DeVos .",
