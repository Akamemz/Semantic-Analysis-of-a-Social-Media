In some cases , aerial gunships have been denied permission to fire even though they reported that targets on the move were armed .\nThe proposed Bilateral Security Agreement announced Wednesday by Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Secretary of State John F. Kerry all but prohibits U.S. troops from entering dwellings during combat . President Obama made the vow directly to Mr. Karzai .\n\u201c U.S . forces shall not enter Afghan homes for the purposes of military operations , except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of U.S. nationals , \u201d Mr. Obama pledged in a letter to the Afghan leader .\nRyan Zinke , who commanded an assault team within SEAL Team 6 , said of the security deal : \u201c The first people who are going to look at it and review it are the enemy we \u2019 re trying to fight . It \u2019 s going to be a document that can be used effectively against us . This is where we either fight or go home .

The rules grew stricter in 2010 after a series of mistaken U.S. bombings killed civilians and special operations troops raided villages and homes at night .\nThe rules of engagement today also place restrictions on dwelling assaults , but Mr. Obama \u2019 s language of \u201c extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk of life and limb \u201d sets the bar much higher .\nSaid retired Army Col. Ken Allard , now a military analyst : \u201c Call me crazy , but what on earth is the point of remaining there under these [ rules of engagement ] , much less subjecting American soldiers to another set of restrictions that make sense only in proportion to your distance from the combat zone ? \u201d\nThe security agreement lays out the legal status of U.S. troops who remain in Afghanistan after the end of 2014 , when all international combat forces are set to leave the country . As many as 18,000 international troops \u2014 including 8,000 from the U.S. \u2014 will remain for 10 years to train and assist Afghan security forces and hunt terrorists .\nTerrorist-hunting missions will require U.S. personnel to engage in combat by accompanying Afghans on counterterrorism raids and supplying close-air support . That is why the rules for when U.S. troops can and can not fire on the enemy or enter a dwelling remain important .\nA rare look at today \u2019 s classified rules of engagement is contained in the huge investigative file on the Afghan Taliban \u2019 s downing of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter last year that killed 30 U.S. troops , including 17 members of SEAL Team 6 . The report notes service members \u2019 frustration at seeing people they knew were Taliban fighters during the August 2012 operation in Afghanistan \u2019 s Tangi Valley , but they were denied permission to shoot .\nAn AH-64 Apache gunship pilot said he saw the spot from where Taliban operatives fired the rocket-propelled grenade that felled the chopper .\n\u201c Due to [ rules of engagement ] and tactical directives , I couldn \u2019 t fire at the building where I thought the [ shooter ] was , so I aimed directly to the west of the building , \u201d the pilot testified , according to transcripts obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nDuring the battle that preceded the shootdown , the crew of an AC-130 gunship spotted two armed Taliban fighters who were moving into new positions .\n\u201c There were several opportunities where we could have engaged with 40 mm ensuring zero [ collateral damage estimate ] on any buildings , \u201d the navigator testified . \u201c The opportunity was definitely there for us to engage those two guys or even provide containment fires to try to slow their movement . \u201d\nAC-130 commander : \u201c I think he spoke with the Ground Force Commander and he said , \u2018 No .
