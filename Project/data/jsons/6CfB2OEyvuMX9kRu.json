    "content": "Hillary Clinton co-founded the Senate India Caucus , which anti-offshoring advocates say champions \u201c issues important to India , including outsourcing and H-1B and L-1 visas . \u201d\nClinton in 2005 : \u201c I am delighted to be the Senator from Punjab as well as from New York . \u201d\nClinton has called for nearly doubling the controversial H-1B guest worker program\u2014suggesting that American workers lack the skills to fill American jobs . She has also defended the cheap labor practices of an Indian outsourcing firm , to which the Clinton Foundation has financial ties : \u201c We are not against all outsourcing ; we are not in favor of putting up fences , \u201d she said .\nShortly after the CEO of HCL\u2014the Indian firm that helped lay off 250 American Disney workers in Orlando\u2014 called American tech graduates \u201c unemployable \u201d , Bill Clinton delivered a speech to HCL to the tune of nearly a quarter of a million dollars at Disney World in Orlando .\nReports note that Clinton has repeatedly \u201c telegraphed \u201d her support for a globalized world to the Indian community . At a conference of 14,000 Indian Americans , Bill Clinton extolled the virtues of \u201c open borders , easy travel , easy immigration \u201d .\nIn 2007 , Barack Obama slammed \u201c Hillary Clinton ( D-Punjab ) \u2019 s personal , financial and political ties to India\u2026 It \u2019 s all about the money , \u201d his campaign wrote .\nAt a 2006 fundraiser , Hillary Clinton jokingly told donors that she could \u201c easily \u201d see herself as the elected representative of foreign citizens in the Indian region of Punjab .\nAs India Abroad reported at the time : \u201c At the fundraiser hosted by Dr Rajwant Singh at his Potomac , Maryland , home\u2026 Clinton began by joking that , \u2018 I can certainly run for the Senate seat in Punjab and win easily , \u2019 after being introduced by Singh as the Senator not only from New York but also Punjab . \u201d\nIt was apparently a line Clinton used more than once . The Sikh Council writes that at a 2005 event in the U.S. Senate , Clinton said : \u201c I am delighted to be the Senator from Punjab as well as from New York . \u201d\nThe statement prompted the campaign of her then-opponent Sen. Barack Obama to call the New York Senator \u201c Hillary Clinton ( D-Punjab ) \u201d in a memo circulated to reporters\u2014 implying that Clinton represents foreign nations and foreign citizens rather than her own American constituents .\nThe memo was titled , \u201c HILLARY CLINTON ( D-PUNJAB ) \u2019 S PERSONAL FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL TIES TO INDIA , \u201d and it extensively detailed Clinton \u2019 s willingness to put the needs and interests of foreign corporations and foreign workers in India ahead of the needs of the American people .\nThe Clintons have reaped significant financial rewards from their relationship with the Indian community , both in their personal finances and Hillary \u2019 s campaign fundraising . Hillary Clinton , who is the co-chair of the Senate India Caucus , has drawn criticism from anti-offshoring groups for her vocal support of Indian business and unwillingness to protect American jobs\u2026 Hillary Clinton has taken tens of thousands [ of dollars ] from companies that outsource jobs to India . Workers who have been laid off in upstate New York might not think that her recent joke that she could be elected to the Senate seat in Punjab is that funny .\nIndeed , while these revelations have received scant to virtually-no coverage by corporate media this election cycle , Clinton has an astonishingly long record of promoting Indian corporations and foreign workers at the direct expense of American workers .\nMost notably , Clinton has extensive ties to corporations responsible for some of the most egregious anti-American worker labor practices : namely , the India-based Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) and HCL .\nThese India-based IT firms specialize in outsourcing and offshoring and are among the top H-1B and L-1 visa employers in the United States . Together HCL and Tata have stolen tens of thousands of U.S. jobs from American workers all across the country . HCL and Tata are responsible for the layoffs of workers from Disney , Southern California Edison , Northeast Utilities , Xerox , University of California , Siemens , and countless others .\nA review of Clinton \u2019 s record shows that she has not only defended and enabled these corporations \u2019 anti-American worker business model , but she has also pushed to expand it\u2014 calling for substantial increases to the number of low-wage workers admitted on guest worker visas and suggesting that American workers lack the requisite skills to fill U.S. jobs .\nInterestingly , both companies have given money to the Clintons either via donations to the Clinton Foundation or paying Bill Clinton to deliver speeches .\nAs the Obama campaign wrote in 2007 about Clinton \u2019 s ties to India , \u201c It \u2019 s all about the money . \u201d\nAs the Washington Post has reported , Tata has given tens of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation :\nAlthough foreign nationals can not contribute to U.S. campaigns , Clinton has won campaign support from the Indian American community , records show\u2026 Tata Consultancy Services contributed between $ 25,000 and $ 50,000 to the Clinton Foundation , and Ratan Tata , then chairman of the Tata Group , was a speaker at the Clinton Global Initiative conference in 2010 .\nTata is also a participant in the Clinton Foundation \u2019 s STEM education program .\nThe Clinton \u2019 s ties to the Indian corporation extend back for over a decade .\nIn 2003 , then-Senator Hillary Clinton was widely-credited for recruiting and helping Tata open a software development center in Buffalo , New York .\nAs a press release issued by Tata , announcing the opening , stated : \u201c The deal was the brainchild of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton . \u201d\nA year before the announcement , Clinton had courted executives from Tata and other Indian businesses\u2014giving them a tour of the region . Clinton was so instrumental to the deal that the company even flew her to Buffalo to join Tata \u2019 s CEO , Subramaniam Ramadorai , for the announcement of the company \u2019 s opening .\nEven at the time , Clinton \u2019 s decision was a controversial one .\nFive days before Clinton and Tata announced the Buffalo opening , Tata came under fire for helping a Siemens unit in Lake Mary , Florida lay off its American workers and forced them to train their lower-wage foreign replacements brought in on guest worker visas .\nAs Bloomberg reported less than a week before the announcement of Tata \u2019 s Buffalo opening , \u201c Siemens made no bones about the cost-cutting nature of the layoff. \u201d Bloomberg noted that one of the foreign replacements , \u201c who speaks halting English , \u201d allegedly earned just one-third of the original American employee \u2019 s $ 98,000 a year salary .\nYet despite public outrage over Siemens and Tata \u2019 s anti-American worker business model , Clinton forged ahead with Tata \u2019 s opening in Buffalo .\n\u201c The event signaled that Clinton , who portrays herself as a fighter for American workers , had aligned herself with Indian American business leaders and Indian companies feared by the labor movement , \u201d the Los Angeles Times reported in 2007 .\nMike Emmons , one of the American Siemens workers who was axed and replaced by a foreign worker , said that he was in touch with Clinton \u2019 s staff as all of this was happening . Yet shortly after Emmons had reached out to Senator Clinton seeking representation and protection for his colleagues from Tata \u2019 s job theft , Emmons was forced to watch as Clinton celebrated Tata at its grand opening in Buffalo .\nIn July of 2016 , Emmons decided to speak out in response to Clinton \u2019 s claim that she finds it \u201c heartbreaking \u201d when American workers are forced to train their foreign replacements . In an op-ed titled , \u201c Don \u2019 t Believe Clinton \u2019 s Crocodile Tears Over Lost American Jobs , \u201d Emmons denounced Clinton \u2019 s \u201c preference for foreign guest workers over qualified Americans. \u201d Emmons pointed specifically to Clinton \u2019 s long history of supporting expansions to the H-1B program and her support for legislation \u201c that would have weakened the already laughably feeble \u2018 protections \u2019 currently in place to prevent Americans from being displaced by guest workers . \u201d\n\u201c For me , the issue is personal . I am a tech worker who was replaced by a foreign guest worker , \u201d Emmons wrote . Emmons said that as he struggled to afford medical care for his handicapped daughter and as he watched his former colleagues struggle to make ends meet , he decided :\nI could not remain silent\u2026 I reached out to elected office-holders across the country , including Hillary Clinton , who had been elected Senator from New York in 2000 . Shortly after I reached out to Senator Clinton \u2019 s office , I saw that she attended the grand opening of a Tata regional office in Buffalo , New York\u2026 If Hillary Clinton truly was heartbroken about Americans being forced to train their foreign replacements , she had ample opportunity to do something about it when she was in office . I for one have good reason not to trust that she will do the right thing if elected [ president ] .\n\u201c Tata has been responsible for destroying tens of thousands of American jobs and depressing the wages of countless more , \u201d said IT labor expert and Howard University Professor Ron Hira , who was a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology at the time of Tata \u2019 s opening in Buffalo .\nHira said that Clinton \u2019 s actions \u201c enabled \u201d Tata \u2019 s anti-American worker business model :\nThese guest workers are imported by Tata because they are cheaper than American workers . Over the ten-year period FY2005-14 , Tata imported an incredible 27,193 H-1B guest workers . We don \u2019 t know how many L-1 workers it imported but it \u2019 s likely more than 10,000 . That \u2019 s at least 27,193 jobs that American workers should have been hired for or in many cases were already doing ( workers at Siemens , Northeast Utilities , and Southern California Edison ) and got replaced by an H-1B worker . Those are high wage jobs that pay more than $ 85k to American workers\u2026 Why would anyone court a company whose business model is based upon destroying American jobs ? It \u2019 s the height of irrationality to think that destroying American jobs is effective economic development policy\u2026 By giving Tata her repeated endorsements she enabled these very practices .\nIndeed , in a 2004 interview with then-CNN host Lou Dobbs , Clinton defended Tata \u2019 s controversial practices , insisting that they brought jobs to Buffalo . \u201c Well , of course I know that they outsource jobs , that they \u2019 ve actually brought jobs to Buffalo . They \u2019 ve created 10 jobs in Buffalo , \u201d she said . \u201c You know , outsourcing does work both ways . \u201d\nIT expert and UC Davis professor Norm Matloff mocked Clinton for her remarks . \u201c Yeah , 10 whole jobs ! \u201d Matloff wrote at the time . \u201c Tata imports thousands of H-1Bs , and offshores untold numbers of jobs , but hey , they created 10 new jobs in the U.S. ! \u201d\nMatloff further pointed out that it was unknown whether those \u201c 10 whole jobs \u201d were even given to American workers , noting that Tata may very well \u201c have filled those 10 jobs with H-1Bs . \u201d\nMost remarkably , during her interview with Dobbs , Clinton declared , \u201c We are not against all outsourcing ; we are not in favor of putting up fences. \u201d Her remarks were reported by the Times of India in an article titled , \u201c Clinton Stands Up For Tata , Outsourcing \u201d .\nDuring a 2005 trip to India , Clinton again reportedly defended the Tata deal , insisting that it represented the type of cooperation that would \u201c help prevent the kind of negative feelings that could be stirred up by \u201d by critics of globalization . While on foreign soil , she called critics of the global marketplace , presumably American workers who have been victims of globalization , \u201c short-sighted . \u201d\nAround the same time , Clinton was pushing policies that would expand the displacement of American workers . In 2006 , Clinton backed Ted Kennedy \u2019 s immigration plan which would have nearly doubled the cap on H-1B visas per year . In 2007 , Clinton specifically called for increasing the pool of foreign workers available to corporate employers . \u201c I also want to reaffirm my commitment to the H-1B visa program and to increase the current cap , \u201d Clinton reportedly told a conference of Indian workers in Silicon Valley , whom she addressed via satellite . \u201c Foreign skilled workers contribute to greatly to our US technological development , \u201d Clinton told the group .\nIn contrast to the \u201c foreign skilled workers \u201d Clinton said she wants to import to the U.S. , Clinton suggested that Americans workers lack the necessary skills to fill U.S. jobs . Without citing any evidence to support her argument\u2014and , indeed , disregarding all of the evidence that would prove her statement to be demonstrably false\u2014Clinton suggested that American workers \u2019 skills are not \u201c in line with the jobs . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s no shortage of talented , hardworking people in the United States\u2014we just need to get the skills more in line with the jobs , \u201d Clinton said amid her call for increasing the importation of foreign workers .\nThis statement is remarkable given the fact that the American workers who Tata replaced\u2014workers like Mike Emmons at Siemens\u2014already had skills that were \u201c in line \u201d with the job they were filling . In fact , the American workers already filling those jobs were more skilled than their foreign replacements , as evidenced by the fact that the American workers had to spend weeks training their foreign lower-wage replacements .\nExperts have shown that there \u2019 s actually a surplus of labor in the tech labor market and have explained that this the reason IT workers have not seen a pay raise since Bill Clinton \u2019 s administration . Despite these realities , Clinton chose to parrot the debunked talking point that there is a shortage of skilled laborers while addressing a conference of Silicon Valley employers in 2007 . Clinton told the crowd that , if elected President , she would address the concerns of Silicon Valley CEOs , who want a larger pool of foreign workers .\n\u201c I have had countless meetings with people from the Silicon Valley and in Silicon Valley bemoaning the shortage in the skills that are needed , \u201d Clinton said .\nClinton said that across the country there are jobs that American workers are not filling\u2014not just tech jobs , but blue collar jobs as well . Clinton suggested that this is because workers do not have the skills for the jobs : \u201c I hear that across the country . There are auto mechanic jobs we can not fill today . Thousands of them , making 50 , 60 , 70 thousand dollars . There are airline mechanic jobs that we can \u2019 t fill \u2014 there are so many jobs that we can \u2019 t get the right mix between the person and the skill and the job . \u201d\n\u201c We need to do more and we have to also recognize the shortage that exists now , \u201d Clinton added . \u201c So I am reaffirming my commitment to the H1B visa and increasing the current cap . Let \u2019 s just face the fact that foreign skilled workers contribute greatly to what we have to do in being innovators\u2026Yes , increase the cap . \u201d\nInterestingly , despite the fact that Clinton has struggled to defend her controversial support for doubling H-1B visas in the past , Computer World \u2019 s Patrick Thibodeau notes that in this election , \u201c the H-1B visa is not mentioned in her immigration platform , her tech policy platform or in the just-released draft platform for the Democratic party . \u201d\nIn addition to Tata , Clinton is also tied to HCL\u2014 the firm that helped Disney World in Orlando , Florida lay off 250 American tech workers and forced them to train their lesser-skilled foreign replacements brought in on H-1B visas .\nInterestingly , Bob Iger , the Disney CEO who presided over the firing and replacement of hundreds of American workers , is also a Hillary Clinton supporter . In August , Iger hosted a big-ticket Hollywood fundraiser for Clinton at the home of billionaire entertainment mogul Haim Saban in Beverly Park , a gated community above Beverly Hills .\nIger serves as a co-chair of an open borders lobbying firm that has advocated for the type of expansions to the foreign worker H-1B program that Clinton has championed .\nThe Disney workers who suffered H-1B job theft are planning on filing a discrimination lawsuit against Disney based on the contract between Disney and HCL . The Disney workers \u2019 attorney told Breitbart that they made discrimination claims under the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act . The claims include discrimination based on national origin ( the displaced workers were American/non-Indian , while their replacements were reportedly Indian nationals ) .\nIndeed , in 2009 , HCL caused a stir when its Chief Executive , Vineet Nayar , said that American tech grads are \u201c unemployable \u201d . As Daily Tech reported at the time :\nMr. Nayar , speaking before an audience of business partners in New York City , blasted American tech grads as \u2018 unemployable \u2019 . He elaborated that he views American tech grads as inferior to those from India , China , and Brazil as the Americans only want to \u2018 get rich \u2019 and dream up \u2018 the next big thing . He says students from countries like India , China , and Brazil are more willing to put the effort into \u2018 boring \u2019 details of tech process and methodology\u2026 Mr. Nayar also complains about the cost of training Americans . He says that most Americans are simply \u2018 too expensive \u2019 to train .\nYet just a few months after HCL \u2019 s then-CEO described American tech graduates as inferior to Indian tech grads , former President Bill Clinton accepted an invitation to speak at the company for a hefty fee . After Nayar \u2019 s anti-American tech worker comments , Clinton ultimately wound up delivering two paid speeches to HCL for a total of $ 375,000 . The first speech was in April of 2010 and the second was in November of 2011 .\nClinton delivered his November 2011 to HCL at Disney World in Orlando , Florida .\nAlmost exactly three years later , 250 American workers at that very same location at Disney World in Orlando Florida were informed that they would be replaced with Indian workers that HCL had helped bring into the country on H-1B visas .\nAs one employee explained , the American workers were gathered together at a meeting with a top Disney executive . Many of the workers\u2014 who had been described as \u201c top performers \u201d \u2014 thought the meeting was to recognize their contributions to the company , or was about a potential promotion , or a bonus of some kind . Some employees even thought the company was throwing them a surprise party . Instead , the Disney executive reportedly informed them , \u201c all of you in this room will be losing your jobs in the next 90 days\u2026 Your jobs have been given over to a foreign workforce . In the meantime , you will be training your replacements until your jobs are 100 percent transferred over to them and if you don \u2019 t cooperate you will not receive any severance pay. \u201d Tears streamed down employees faces , others completely broke down and were \u201c crying out loud , \u201d \u201c one employee was murmuring \u2018 no , this can \u2019 t be \u2019 as they were marched out of the room . \u201d\nNinety days later , as one employee found himself living on unemployment payments , he spoke of the \u201c sleepless nights \u201d that accompanied the pressure of trying to provide for food and shelter for his family . He spoke of the feeling of alienation that accompanied the \u201c huge influx \u2019 of foreign workers whose presence transformed the composition of the company overnight . \u201c A foreign language was suddenly being spoken throughout the building hallways , \u201d the worker said . He said he felt \u201c betrayed \u201d and described the \u201c humiliat [ ing ] , \u201d \u201c disgraceful \u201d and \u201c demoralizing \u201d experience as he had no choice but \u201c to watch a foreign worker completely take over my job . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve spoken to thousands of American families whose lives have been destroyed by this business model , \u201d said the Disney workers \u2019 attorney , Sara Blackwell , who runs an organization that represents high-skilled American workers who have been replaced by low-wage foreign guest workers .\n\u201c American workers tend to have a very emotional reaction to being forced to train their replacements , \u201d Blackwell explained .\nThey know that they are being sold out . And they feel as though they are contributing to the death of the American tech workforce by training their replacements , but they \u2019 ve been forced to do it in order to get their severance pay , which they need so that they can pay their mortgage , and feed their families . Workers tell me that they feel physically sick as they \u2019 re forced to train their replacements . They go home and vomit ; they cry every single night ; they go into counseling ; they \u2019 re admitted to hospitals ; there are divorces ; we \u2019 ve seen two suicides as a result of these cheap labor practices . And when the workers are officially let go and can \u2019 t find work , that kind of emotional distress drives a lot of them to homelessness , a lot of them move in with their older parents . It has single-handedly destroyed American families by the thousands .\n\u201c Hillary Clinton is by far the worst person we could have in the White House , \u201d Blackwell added . \u201c If Hillary wins , there will be no protections for these American workers . They will have no voice . \u201d\nThe Obama campaign memo hitting Clinton \u2019 s ties to India also emphasized that \u201c in 2004 , Clinton co-founded and became the co-chair of the Senate India Caucus which was coordinated by the U.S. India Political Action Committee ( USINPAC ) . \u201d\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times , the USINPAC \u201c cites the Tata deal as one of Clinton \u2019 s top three achievements as a senator\u2013 and evidence of a turnabout , in its view , from her past criticism of outsourcing . \u2018 Even though she was against outsourcing at the beginning of her political career , \u2019 the USINPAC website says , \u2018 she has since changed her position and now maintains that offshoring brings as much economic value to the United States as to the country where services are outsourced , especially India . \u2019 \u201d\nInformation Technology Professionals Association of America ( ITPAA ) \u2014 an anti-offshoring advocacy group that labeled Clinton a \u201c weasel \u201d in 2005 for her embrace of anti-American worker labor practices\u2014described Clinton \u2019 s India caucus as \u201c a group of senators that supports issues important to India , including outsourcing and H-1B and L-1 visas . \u201d\nA blog post on the CWA union \u2019 s website warned that Clinton \u2019 s India Caucus represents , \u201c the first time in the history of the U.S. Senate that a country-focused caucus has been constituted. \u201d The CWA post urged readers to \u201c check if your U.S . Senator is a member of the caucus . If Yes , WRITE and object to the H-1B Visa Program and OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING OF AMERICAN JOBS ! \u201d\nIndeed , as the Los Angeles Times reported , in her effort to \u201c woo \u201d wealthy Indian Americans donors , Clinton has repeatedly \u201c telegraphed \u201d her support for a globalized world , including the benefits of \u201c open borders \u201d and outsourcing .\nClinton is successfully wooing wealthy Indian Americans , many of them business leaders with close ties to their native country and an interest in protecting outsourcing laws and expanding access to worker visas . Her campaign has held three fundraisers in the Indian American community recently , one of which raised close to $ 3 million , its sponsor told an Indian news organization\u2026 Her campaign continues to telegraph \u2014 sometimes in front of Indian American audiences \u2014 that she sees benefits to a globalized world . Three weeks ago , her husband drew applause at a conference of 14,000 Indian Americans in Washington as he extolled the benefits of \u201c open borders , easy travel , easy immigration. \u201d He said the outsourcing debate bothered him because it failed to acknowledge the contributions of Indians who settled in the U.S . The same day , he headlined a fundraiser at the conference for his wife \u2019 s campaign .\nWhile then-Senator Obama\u2014who as President pushed policies to expand the displacement of American workers through large-scale foreign worker programs\u2014eventually apologized for the memo \u2019 s \u201c caustic tone , \u201d his campaign \u2019 s message was unmistakably clear : a Hillary Clinton Presidency would not represent the interests of American workers , but would instead represent the desires of wealthy donors and foreign corporations .\nWhile Clinton \u2019 s record on these issues were apparently a topic of discussion during the 2008 election , it is perhaps interesting that in the 2016 election\u2014which has been so driven by the issues of trade , immigration , national sovereignty , and opposition to globalization\u2014 Clinton \u2019 s history on this issue has received so little attention . It remains to be seen whether Clinton will be asked about her controversial positions on these subjects during next week \u2019 s debate .",

HCL and Tata are responsible for the layoffs of workers from Disney, Southern California Edison, Northeast Utilities, Xerox, University of California, Siemens, and countless others.\n\nA review of Clinton\u2019s record shows that she has not only defended and enabled these corporations\u2019 anti-American worker business model, but she has also pushed to expand it\u2014 calling for substantial increases to the number of low-wage workers admitted on guest worker visas and suggesting that American workers lack the requisite skills to fill U.S. jobs.\n\nInterestingly, both companies have given money to the Clintons either via donations to the Clinton Foundation or paying Bill Clinton to deliver speeches.\n\nAs the Obama campaign wrote in 2007 about Clinton\u2019s ties to India, \u201cIt\u2019s all about the money.\u201d\n\nTata\n\nAs the Washington Post has reported, Tata has given tens of thousands of dollars to the Clinton Foundation:\n\nAlthough foreign nationals cannot contribute to U.S. campaigns, Clinton has won campaign support from the Indian American community, records show\u2026 Tata Consultancy Services contributed between $25,000 and $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and Ratan Tata, then chairman of the Tata Group, was a speaker at the Clinton Global Initiative conference in 2010.\n\nTata is also a participant in the Clinton Foundation\u2019s STEM education program.\n\nThe Clinton\u2019s ties to the Indian corporation extend back for over a decade.\n\nIn 2003, then-Senator Hillary Clinton was widely-credited for recruiting and helping Tata open a software development center in Buffalo, New York.\n\nAs a press release issued by Tata, announcing the opening, stated: \u201cThe deal was the brainchild of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d\n\nA year before the announcement, Clinton had courted executives from Tata and other Indian businesses\u2014giving them a tour of the region. Clinton was so instrumental to the deal that the company even flew her to Buffalo to join Tata\u2019s CEO, Subramaniam Ramadorai, for the announcement of the company\u2019s opening.\n\nEven at the time, Clinton\u2019s decision was a controversial one.\n\nFive days before Clinton and Tata announced the Buffalo opening, Tata came under fire for helping a Siemens unit in Lake Mary, Florida lay off its American workers and forced them to train their lower-wage foreign replacements brought in on guest worker visas.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported less than a week before the announcement of Tata\u2019s Buffalo opening, \u201cSiemens made no bones about the cost-cutting nature of the layoff.\u201d Bloomberg noted that one of the foreign replacements, \u201cwho speaks halting English,\u201d allegedly earned just one-third of the original American employee\u2019s $98,000 a year salary.\n\nYet despite public outrage over Siemens and Tata\u2019s anti-American worker business model, Clinton forged ahead with Tata\u2019s opening in Buffalo.\n\n\u201cThe event signaled that Clinton, who portrays herself as a fighter for American workers, had aligned herself with Indian American business leaders and Indian companies feared by the labor movement,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported in 2007.\n\nMike Emmons, one of the American Siemens workers who was axed and replaced by a foreign worker, said that he was in touch with Clinton\u2019s staff as all of this was happening. Yet shortly after Emmons had reached out to Senator Clinton seeking representation and protection for his colleagues from Tata\u2019s job theft, Emmons was forced to watch as Clinton celebrated Tata at its grand opening in Buffalo.\n\nIn July of 2016, Emmons decided to speak out in response to Clinton\u2019s claim that she finds it \u201cheartbreaking\u201d when American workers are forced to train their foreign replacements. In an op-ed titled, \u201cDon\u2019t Believe Clinton\u2019s Crocodile Tears Over Lost American Jobs,\u201d Emmons denounced Clinton\u2019s \u201cpreference for foreign guest workers over qualified Americans.\u201d Emmons pointed specifically to Clinton\u2019s long history of supporting expansions to the H-1B program and her support for legislation \u201cthat would have weakened the already laughably feeble \u2018protections\u2019 currently in place to prevent Americans from being displaced by guest workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, the issue is personal. I am a tech worker who was replaced by a foreign guest worker,\u201d Emmons wrote. Emmons said that as he struggled to afford medical care for his handicapped daughter and as he watched his former colleagues struggle to make ends meet, he decided:\n\nI could not remain silent\u2026 I reached out to elected office-holders across the country, including Hillary Clinton, who had been elected Senator from New York in 2000. Shortly after I reached out to Senator Clinton\u2019s office, I saw that she attended the grand opening of a Tata regional office in Buffalo, New York\u2026 If Hillary Clinton truly was heartbroken about Americans being forced to train their foreign replacements, she had ample opportunity to do something about it when she was in office. I for one have good reason not to trust that she will do the right thing if elected [president].\n\n\u201cTata has been responsible for destroying tens of thousands of American jobs and depressing the wages of countless more,\u201d said IT labor expert and Howard University Professor Ron Hira, who was a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology at the time of Tata\u2019s opening in Buffalo.\n\nHira said that Clinton\u2019s actions \u201cenabled\u201d Tata\u2019s anti-American worker business model:\n\nThese guest workers are imported by Tata because they are cheaper than American workers. Over the ten-year period FY2005-14, Tata imported an incredible 27,193 H-1B guest workers. We don\u2019t know how many L-1 workers it imported but it\u2019s likely more than 10,000. That\u2019s at least 27,193 jobs that American workers should have been hired for or in many cases were already doing (workers at Siemens, Northeast Utilities, and Southern California Edison) and got replaced by an H-1B worker. Those are high wage jobs that pay more than $85k to American workers\u2026 Why would anyone court a company whose business model is based upon destroying American jobs? It\u2019s the height of irrationality to think that destroying American jobs is effective economic development policy\u2026 By giving Tata her repeated endorsements she enabled these very practices.\n\nIndeed, in a 2004 interview with then-CNN host Lou Dobbs, Clinton defended Tata\u2019s controversial practices, insisting that they brought jobs to Buffalo. \u201cWell, of course I know that they outsource jobs, that they\u2019ve actually brought jobs to Buffalo. They\u2019ve created 10 jobs in Buffalo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, outsourcing does work both ways.\u201d\n\nIT expert and UC Davis professor Norm Matloff mocked Clinton for her remarks. \u201cYeah, 10 whole jobs!\u201d Matloff wrote at the time. \u201cTata imports thousands of H-1Bs, and offshores untold numbers of jobs, but hey, they created 10 new jobs in the U.S.!\u201d\n\nMatloff further pointed out that it was unknown whether those \u201c10 whole jobs\u201d were even given to American workers, noting that Tata may very well \u201chave filled those 10 jobs with H-1Bs.\u201d\n\nMost remarkably, during her interview with Dobbs, Clinton declared, \u201cWe are not against all outsourcing; we are not in favor of putting up fences.\u201d Her remarks were reported by the Times of India in an article titled, \u201cClinton Stands Up For Tata, Outsourcing\u201d.\n\nDuring a 2005 trip to India, Clinton again reportedly defended the Tata deal, insisting that it represented the type of cooperation that would \u201chelp prevent the kind of negative feelings that could be stirred up by\u201d by critics of globalization. While on foreign soil, she called critics of the global marketplace, presumably American workers who have been victims of globalization, \u201cshort-sighted.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Clinton was pushing policies that would expand the displacement of American workers. In 2006, Clinton backed Ted Kennedy\u2019s immigration plan which would have nearly doubled the cap on H-1B visas per year. In 2007, Clinton specifically called for increasing the pool of foreign workers available to corporate employers. \u201cI also want to reaffirm my commitment to the H-1B visa program and to increase the current cap,\u201d Clinton reportedly told a conference of Indian workers in Silicon Valley, whom she addressed via satellite. \u201cForeign skilled workers contribute to greatly to our US technological development,\u201d Clinton told the group.\n\nIn contrast to the \u201cforeign skilled workers\u201d Clinton said she wants to import to the U.S., Clinton suggested that Americans workers lack the necessary skills to fill U.S. jobs. Without citing any evidence to support her argument\u2014and, indeed, disregarding all of the evidence that would prove her statement to be demonstrably false\u2014Clinton suggested that American workers\u2019 skills are not \u201cin line with the jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of talented, hardworking people in the United States\u2014we just need to get the skills more in line with the jobs,\u201d Clinton said amid her call for increasing the importation of foreign workers.\n\nThis statement is remarkable given the fact that the American workers who Tata replaced\u2014workers like Mike Emmons at Siemens\u2014already had skills that were \u201cin line\u201d with the job they were filling. In fact, the American workers already filling those jobs were more skilled than their foreign replacements, as evidenced by the fact that the American workers had to spend weeks training their foreign lower-wage replacements.\n\nExperts have shown that there\u2019s actually a surplus of labor in the tech labor market and have explained that this the reason IT workers have not seen a pay raise since Bill Clinton\u2019s administration. Despite these realities, Clinton chose to parrot the debunked talking point that there is a shortage of skilled laborers while addressing a conference of Silicon Valley employers in 2007. Clinton told the crowd that, if elected President, she would address the concerns of Silicon Valley CEOs, who want a larger pool of foreign workers.\n\n\u201cI have had countless meetings with people from the Silicon Valley and in Silicon Valley bemoaning the shortage in the skills that are needed,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton said that across the country there are jobs that American workers are not filling\u2014not just tech jobs, but blue collar jobs as well. Clinton suggested that this is because workers do not have the skills for the jobs: \u201cI hear that across the country. There are auto mechanic jobs we cannot fill today. Thousands of them, making 50, 60, 70 thousand dollars. There are airline mechanic jobs that we can\u2019t fill \u2014 there are so many jobs that we can\u2019t get the right mix between the person and the skill and the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to do more and we have to also recognize the shortage that exists now,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cSo I am reaffirming my commitment to the H1B visa and increasing the current cap. Let\u2019s just face the fact that foreign skilled workers contribute greatly to what we have to do in being innovators\u2026Yes, increase the cap.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, despite the fact that Clinton has struggled to defend her controversial support for doubling H-1B visas in the past, Computer World\u2019s Patrick Thibodeau notes that in this election, \u201cthe H-1B visa is not mentioned in her immigration platform, her tech policy platform or in the just-released draft platform for the Democratic party.\u201d\n\nHCL\n\nIn addition to Tata, Clinton is also tied to HCL\u2014 the firm that helped Disney World in Orlando, Florida lay off 250 American tech workers and forced them to train their lesser-skilled foreign replacements brought in on H-1B visas.\n\nInterestingly, Bob Iger, the Disney CEO who presided over the firing and replacement of hundreds of American workers, is also a Hillary Clinton supporter. In August, Iger hosted a big-ticket Hollywood fundraiser for Clinton at the home of billionaire entertainment mogul Haim Saban in Beverly Park, a gated community above Beverly Hills.\n\nIger serves as a co-chair of an open borders lobbying firm that has advocated for the type of expansions to the foreign worker H-1B program that Clinton has championed.\n\nThe Disney workers who suffered H-1B job theft are planning on filing a discrimination lawsuit against Disney based on the contract between Disney and HCL. The Disney workers\u2019 attorney told Breitbart that they made discrimination claims under the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The claims include discrimination based on national origin (the displaced workers were American/non-Indian, while their replacements were reportedly Indian nationals).\n\nIndeed, in 2009, HCL caused a stir when its Chief Executive, Vineet Nayar, said that American tech grads are \u201cunemployable\u201d. As Daily Tech reported at the time:\n\nMr. Nayar, speaking before an audience of business partners in New York City, blasted American tech grads as \u2018unemployable\u2019. He elaborated that he views American tech grads as inferior to those from India, China, and Brazil as the Americans only want to \u2018get rich\u2019 and dream up \u2018the next big thing. He says students from countries like India, China, and Brazil are more willing to put the effort into \u2018boring\u2019 details of tech process and methodology\u2026 Mr. Nayar also complains about the cost of training Americans. He says that most Americans are simply \u2018too expensive\u2019 to train.\n\nThe comments sparked outrage amongst the American tech community.\n\nYet just a few months after HCL\u2019s then-CEO described American tech graduates as inferior to Indian tech grads, former President Bill Clinton accepted an invitation to speak at the company for a hefty fee. After Nayar\u2019s anti-American tech worker comments, Clinton ultimately wound up delivering two paid speeches to HCL for a total of $375,000. The first speech was in April of 2010 and the second was in November of 2011.\n\nClinton delivered his November 2011 to HCL at Disney World in Orlando, Florida.\n\nAlmost exactly three years later, 250 American workers at that very same location at Disney World in Orlando Florida were informed that they would be replaced with Indian workers that HCL had helped bring into the country on H-1B visas.\n\nAs one employee explained, the American workers were gathered together at a meeting with a top Disney executive. Many of the workers\u2014 who had been described as \u201ctop performers\u201d\u2014 thought the meeting was to recognize their contributions to the company, or was about a potential promotion, or a bonus of some kind. Some employees even thought the company was throwing them a surprise party. Instead, the Disney executive reportedly informed them, \u201call of you in this room will be losing your jobs in the next 90 days\u2026 Your jobs have been given over to a foreign workforce. In the meantime, you will be training your replacements until your jobs are 100 percent transferred over to them and if you don\u2019t cooperate you will not receive any severance pay.\u201d Tears streamed down employees faces, others completely broke down and were \u201ccrying out loud,\u201d \u201cone employee was murmuring \u2018no, this can\u2019t be\u2019 as they were marched out of the room.\u201d\n\nNinety days later, as one employee found himself living on unemployment payments, he spoke of the \u201csleepless nights\u201d that accompanied the pressure of trying to provide for food and shelter for his family. He spoke of the feeling of alienation that accompanied the \u201chuge influx\u2019 of foreign workers whose presence transformed the composition of the company overnight. \u201cA foreign language was suddenly being spoken throughout the building hallways,\u201d the worker said. He said he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d and described the \u201chumiliat[ing],\u201d \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing\u201d experience as he had no choice but \u201cto watch a foreign worker completely take over my job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of American families whose lives have been destroyed by this business model,\u201d said the Disney workers\u2019 attorney, Sara Blackwell, who runs an organization that represents high-skilled American workers who have been replaced by low-wage foreign guest workers.\n\n\u201cAmerican workers tend to have a very emotional reaction to being forced to train their replacements,\u201d Blackwell explained.\n\nThey know that they are being sold out. And they feel as though they are contributing to the death of the American tech workforce by training their replacements, but they\u2019ve been forced to do it in order to get their severance pay, which they need so that they can pay their mortgage, and feed their families. Workers tell me that they feel physically sick as they\u2019re forced to train their replacements. They go home and vomit; they cry every single night; they go into counseling; they\u2019re admitted to hospitals; there are divorces; we\u2019ve seen two suicides as a result of these cheap labor practices. And when the workers are officially let go and can\u2019t find work, that kind of emotional distress drives a lot of them to homelessness, a lot of them move in with their older parents. It has single-handedly destroyed American families by the thousands.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is by far the worst person we could have in the White House,\u201d Blackwell added. \u201cIf Hillary wins, there will be no protections for these American workers. They will have no voice.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s Favorite Senator\n\nThe Obama campaign memo hitting Clinton\u2019s ties to India also emphasized that \u201cin 2004, Clinton co-founded and became the co-chair of the Senate India Caucus which was coordinated by the U.S. India Political Action Committee (USINPAC).\u201d\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the USINPAC \u201ccites the Tata deal as one of Clinton\u2019s top three achievements as a senator\u2013 and evidence of a turnabout, in its view, from her past criticism of outsourcing. \u2018Even though she was against outsourcing at the beginning of her political career,\u2019 the USINPAC website says, \u2018she has since changed her position and now maintains that offshoring brings as much economic value to the United States as to the country where services are outsourced, especially India.\u2019\u201d\n\nInformation Technology Professionals Association of America (ITPAA)\u2014 an anti-offshoring advocacy group that labeled Clinton a \u201cweasel\u201d in 2005 for her embrace of anti-American worker labor practices\u2014described Clinton\u2019s India caucus as \u201ca group of senators that supports issues important to India, including outsourcing and H-1B and L-1 visas.\u201d\n\nA blog post on the CWA union\u2019s website warned that Clinton\u2019s India Caucus represents, \u201cthe first time in the history of the U.S. Senate that a country-focused caucus has been constituted.\u201d The CWA post urged readers to \u201ccheck if your U.S. Senator is a member of the caucus. If Yes, WRITE and object to the H-1B Visa Program and OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING OF AMERICAN JOBS!\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the Los Angeles Times reported, in her effort to \u201cwoo\u201d wealthy Indian Americans donors, Clinton has repeatedly \u201ctelegraphed\u201d her support for a globalized world, including the benefits of \u201copen borders\u201d and outsourcing.\n\nClinton is successfully wooing wealthy Indian Americans, many of them business leaders with close ties to their native country and an interest in protecting outsourcing laws and expanding access to worker visas. Her campaign has held three fundraisers in the Indian American community recently, one of which raised close to $3 million, its sponsor told an Indian news organization\u2026 Her campaign continues to telegraph \u2014 sometimes in front of Indian American audiences \u2014 that she sees benefits to a globalized world. Three weeks ago, her husband drew applause at a conference of 14,000 Indian Americans in Washington as he extolled the benefits of \u201copen borders, easy travel, easy immigration.\u201d He said the outsourcing debate bothered him because it failed to acknowledge the contributions of Indians who settled in the U.S. The same day, he headlined a fundraiser at the conference for his wife\u2019s campaign.\n\nWhile then-Senator Obama\u2014who as President pushed policies to expand the displacement of American workers through large-scale foreign worker programs\u2014eventually apologized for the memo\u2019s \u201ccaustic tone,\u201d his campaign\u2019s message was unmistakably clear: a Hillary Clinton Presidency would not represent the interests of American workers, but would instead represent the desires of wealthy donors and foreign corporations.\n\nWhile Clinton\u2019s record on these issues were apparently a topic of discussion during the 2008 election, it is perhaps interesting that in the 2016 election\u2014which has been so driven by the issues of trade, immigration, national sovereignty, and opposition to globalization\u2014 Clinton\u2019s history on this issue has received so little attention. It remains to be seen whether Clinton will be asked about her controversial positions on these subjects during next week\u2019s debate.",
