The Justice Department also didn \u2019 t comment .\nMikerin was a director of Rosatom \u2019 s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s , where he oversaw Rosatom \u2019 s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries . In 2010 , Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom \u2019 s new American arm called Tenam .\nBetween 2009 and January 2012 , Mikerin \u201c did knowingly and willfully combine , conspire confederate and agree with other persons \u2026 to obstruct , delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity ( enriched uranium ) in commerce by extortion , \u201d a November 2014 indictment stated .\nHis illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness , an American businessman , who began making kickback payments at Mikerin \u2019 s direction and with the permission of the FBI .
