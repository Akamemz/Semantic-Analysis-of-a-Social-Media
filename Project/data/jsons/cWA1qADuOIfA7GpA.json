Harry Reid : Republican attacks on Rice 's character were `` shameful ''\nNomination would be `` be lengthy , disruptive , and costly , '' she says in letter to president\nRepublican critics `` respect '' Rice 's decision , vow to continue Benghazi inquiry\nSusan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who drew heavy criticism from Republicans over her statements after the September attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission , withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state on Thursday .\nIn a letter to President Barack Obama , she said `` the confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive , and costly -- to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities . That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country . ''\nObama acknowledged her letter in a statement that described her as `` an extraordinarily capable , patriotic , and passionate public servant . '' He will meet with Rice Friday at the White House , National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said .\nShe was thought to be a frontrunner for the post , which Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would vacate as soon as a successor is confirmed .\nBut Rice drew criticism for her description of the September 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi , Libya , which killed four including the U.S . Ambassador to Libya , Chris Stevens . On several television programs several days after the attack , she described a protest of an anti-Islam video outside the mission buildings .\nJUST WATCHED Obama on Rice withdrawal , fiscal cliff Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama on Rice withdrawal , fiscal cliff 01:17\nJUST WATCHED Rogers : Rice was facing uphill battle Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rogers : Rice was facing uphill battle 00:59\nShe said her comments were based on declassified talking points , and sources within the intelligence community said the talking points were not modified by any other body , such as the White House .\nShe further explained her decision to withdraw and defended herself Thursday in a piece for the Washington Post , writing : `` I have never sought in any way , shape or form to mislead the American people . ... Even before I was nominated for any new position , a steady drip of manufactured charges painted a wholly false picture of me . ''\nObama had defended her , describing the criticism from several key Republicans as `` outrageous . '' `` If Senator ( John ) McCain and Senator ( Lindsey ) Graham and others want to go after someone , they should go after me , '' Obama said at a White House news conference in late November . `` When they go after the U.N. ambassador , apparently because they think she 's an easy target , then they 've got a problem with me . ''\nShe visited Capitol Hill in an attempt to answer what the legislators called `` unanswered questions , '' but her visit there appeared to backfire . Senators who sat in on the meetings said her appearances raised more questions than they answered .\nHer closed-door meetings `` really hurt her , '' one knowledgeable Democratic source said . `` She probably underestimated the club . ''\nThe longer Rice went un-nominated , the source said , the worse her prospects appeared . It was `` better to get out now '' so that Obama could begin announcing a national security slate as early as next week .\nIn a statement , Clinton called Rice `` an indispensable partner over the past four years . ''\n`` From the National Security Council to the State Department to the United Nations , Susan has worked tirelessly to advance our nation 's interests and values . I am confident that she will continue to represent the United States with strength and skill , '' Clinton said .\nAfter Rice 's Thursday announcement , Graham said in a statement : `` I respect Ambassador Rice 's decision . President Obama has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next secretary of state . ''\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid described Republican opposition to Rice 's possible nomination as `` shameful . ''\n`` Ambassador Rice is eminently qualified to serve as Secretary of State and she could have been confirmed by the Senate . The politically motivated attacks on her character from some of my Republican colleagues were shameful , '' the Nevada Democrat said in a statement . `` Their behavior was a disgrace to the Senate 's tradition of bipartisan cooperation on national security issues and beneath the stature of senators with otherwise distinguished records on national security . ''\nRice 's decision to not seek the post now leaves Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , as the presumed frontrunner for the spot . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other high-ranking officials are also expected to depart soon .\nKerry praised Rice as `` an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant '' in a statement after her announcement .\n`` I 've known and worked closely with Susan Rice not just at the U.N. , but in my own campaign for president . I 've defended her publicly and would n't hesitate to do so again because I know her character and I know her commitment , '' he wrote . `` We should all be grateful that she will continue to serve and contribute at the highest level . As someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be , I 've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks , but I also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction . ''\nKerry 's road to the State Department , should he be nominated , would appear to be smoother than Rice 's . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said after Rice 's announcement that Kerry would be a `` popular choice with the Senate . ''\nAnother Senate Republican , Rob Portman of Ohio , named Kerry as one of Obama 's `` better choices '' for the spot , according to The New York Times .\nBut despite his lauded role assisting Obama in preparing for the presidential debates this fall , Kerry is understood to be less of an Obama confidante than Rice .\nKerry is a decorated veteran who served two tours of duty in Vietnam before his career as a lawyer and then in the U.S. Senate . His assignments there include the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee .\nShould Kerry step down before his term ends in 2014 , Gov . Deval Patrick , a Democrat , would appoint a temporary replacement to hold the seat until a special election could be held . The special election race would likely include Sen. Scott Brown , who won in a special election three years ago but lost his bid for a full term , as well as Democratic Rep. Ed Markey , who is seriously considering a bid should Kerry 's seat open , a Democratic source said .\nOn Thursday , Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-New Hampshire said she had `` respect '' for Rice 's decision , `` however , my concerns regarding the terrorist attack in Benghazi go beyond any one individual . I remain deeply troubled by the continued lack of information from the White House and the State Department . With four of our public servants murdered , it is critical that we get to the bottom of what happened . ''\nAyotte told CNN after the late November meeting with Rice , Graham , and McCain , `` Certainly she misled the American public . ''\nFormer CIA Director David Petraeus , who resigned last month after admitting to an extramarital affair , returned to Capitol Hill to testify on the attacks , and Clinton is scheduled to testify next week .\nSen. Susan Collins , the moderate Republican from Maine , said through a spokesman that the Senate Homeland Security Committee , where she serves as ranking member , would continue its investigation into the Benghazi attack . She had raised her own questions about Rice 's potential nomination after a private meeting with the ambassador .\nThe Thursday decision was Rice 's own ; she was not asked to step aside in the consideration process , a former administration official who had knowledge of her decision said .\n`` She has got a lot of honor , a lot of dignity , a lot of patriotism . This was a completely manufactured distraction , and she was determined to put her country first , '' the former official said . `` No nominee for secretary of state has been subjected to such a sustained campaign of politicization and slander . And it is really troubling . ''\nMadeleine Albright , who was the first woman to serve as secretary of state and has known Rice for decades , said Rice is `` brilliant '' and described her withdrawal from consideration as `` sad . ''\n`` I think it is genuinely , genuinely sad because she is one of the smartest people that I know and completely dedicated to serving the United States , '' Albright told CNN . Rice `` put the country and the president ahead of her own ambition . It just shows what a tremendously thoughtful and good and responsible person she is . ''\nIn her letter to Obama , Rice wrote `` the position of secretary of state should never be politicized . ''\n`` As someone who grew up in an era of comparative bipartisanship and as a sitting U.S. national security official who has served in two U.S. administrations , I am saddened that we have reached this point , even before you have decided whom to nominate , '' she wrote . `` We can not afford such an irresponsible distraction from the most pressing issues facing the American people . ''\nRice served in President Bill Clinton 's administration on the National Security Council , eventually leading African affairs for the council and serving as a special assistant to the president .\nShe was confirmed by the Senate as the top diplomat to the U.N. in January 2009 .\nIf Rice had been nominated , she would have faced criticism from religious leaders about her role in the Clinton administration 's handling of the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s .\nU.S. Rep. Mike Rogers , chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said on CNN that Rice 's decision was `` probably for the best . ''\n`` I think Ambassador Rice was facing an uphill battle in the senate for any confirmation she may have received , '' he said .\nAsked in an interview Thursday on NBC whether she wanted the top diplomatic post , Rice replied that she `` would have been very honored to serve in that job . ''\nShe added , `` But yeah , sure . How can you not want to -- in my field -- serve at the highest possible level ? ''",
