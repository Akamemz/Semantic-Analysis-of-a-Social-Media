    "content": "President Obama used his press conference Tuesday to reiterate his intention to name a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and his frustration with Republican declarations that they will block the nominee , sight unseen .\nBut how he expressed that frustration was interesting . There was the customary scolding of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans , but overall Obama emphasized that the problem is n't individual senators . It 's political polarization :\nI understand the stakes . I understand the pressure that Republican senators are undoubtedly under . I mean , the fact of the matter is that what the issue here is that the court is now divided on many issues this would be a deciding vote . And there are a lot of Republican senators who are going to be under a lot of pressure from various special interests and various constituencies and many of their voters to not let any nominee go through . No matter who I nominate . But that 's not how the system is supposed to work . That 's not how our democracy is supposed to work .\nHe 's not saying this is inevitable . There 'd be little reason for him to do so : If there 's even a sliver of a chance that the Senate will approve a nominee , he wants to leave that possibility open . But tellingly , while he argues that Republicans are violating political precedent , he also argues it makes sense for them to do so . They 're not being irrational . They 're responding to the demands of an increasingly right-wing voter base , an aftereffect of a broader trend toward political polarization .\nAnd he also implicitly acknowledges that Supreme Court appointments are ideological . He does n't outright say that the Court is evenly divided on partisan lines , but it is , and that 's clearly what he means . And given that , of course it makes sense for the party set to lose its leg up to fight extremely hard to prevent its opponents from filling the seat .\nObama was even more explicit about this when questioned about his own participation in an effort to filibuster the nomination of Samuel Alito in 2006 :\nI think what 's fair to say is that how judicial nominations have evolved over time is not historically the fault of any single party . This has become just one more extension of politics .
