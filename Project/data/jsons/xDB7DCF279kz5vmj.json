Matthew \u2019 s version ends with Joseph and Mary whisking the baby off to a foreign country because the authorities wanted to kill him . Putting these together , the heart of the story is precisely Jesus the homeless asylum seeker .\nAnyone who knows the history and culture of the first-century Jewish world would see the point . Matthew introduces his Christmas story by listing Jesus \u2019 ancestry , all the way back to Abraham , highlighting King David on the way . It \u2019 s obvious where this was going : Jesus was the true \u201c king of the Jews \u201d \u2014 at a time where there was one of those already , Herod the Great . That \u2019 s why Joseph had to take Jesus and Mary away in a hurry . The same is true with Luke \u2019 s story , in which the Roman Emperor , the self-styled \u201c son of God \u201d Augustus himself , issues an order in Rome which causes a very different \u201c son of God \u201d to be born in a very different \u201c royal city , \u201d Bethlehem . The original , historic Christmas stories are about power . They are about the kingdom of God breaking in , dangerously and unexpectedly , into the kingdoms of the world .\nThe misunderstanding arises from a larger problem . Western culture has placed Christianity in a box called \u201c religion , \u201d separated off by definition from the rest of \u201c real life. \u201d Some Christmas Carols try to break this mold : think of \u201c It came upon a midnight clear , \u201d which contrasts the song of the angels with the subsequent \u201c two thousand years of wrong. \u201d But most are content with the schmaltzy ( \u201c But only his mother/in her maiden bliss/worshipped the Beloved/with a kiss \u201d ) , the sentimental ( \u201c the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay \u201d ) and the toe-curlingly moralistic ( \u201c Christian children all must be/mild , obedient , good as he \u201d ) . Once you pull apart the seamless fabric of the original story , that \u2019 s all you are left with . And that \u2019 s what today \u2019 s younger generation , eager for real-life relevance , is abandoning in droves .\nOur culture has downgraded the Christmas stories into sweet little songs and primary-school Nativity plays . But the birth of a baby who will inherit \u201c the throne of his ancestor David \u201d \u2014as the angel says to Mary in Luke 1:32\u2014announces the start of a revolution . Nothing will ever be the same again . In Israel \u2019 s scriptures , David already ruled over the Twelve Tribes , but the Psalms and Prophets insisted that his ultimate successor would rule over the whole world . Anyone claiming David \u2019 s kingdom is throwing down a challenge to the rulers of the world , whether in the first century or the twenty-first .\nBut what sort of a challenge ? We are so scared of \u201c theocracy \u201d ( think : mad clerics bullying people into submission ) that the thought of Jesus and his followers posing a real-life \u201c challenge \u201d is enough to send people back to the anodyne Christmas carols . The question of \u201c theocracy , \u201d ( literally , the rule of God ) , however , turns on which God it is we \u2019 re talking about . And here Matthew and Luke , starting with their Christmas stories , are clear . Their accounts of Jesus , right through to his cruel death at the hands of the Roman imperial power , are saying , from a hundred different angles , This is what it looks like when the real God comes to the rescue . They echo the ancient biblical stories about Israel \u2019 s God : the God who made the world in the first place ; the one who heard his people \u2019 s cry and came to rescue them through Moses ; the one who always wanted to come and live in amongst his people and through them to renew and restore his whole creation .\nThe stories that begin at Christmas end with Jesus \u2019 followers sent into the world to launch a new way of being human ; a new kind of power ; the divine power of self-giving love .
