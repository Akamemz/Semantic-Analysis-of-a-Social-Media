    "content": "Roughly one-quarter of people with health insurance are paying deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that are so high they are considered underinsured , a new study has found.The 2014 national health insurance survey by the Commonwealth Fund estimates that 31 million insured people are not sufficiently protected against high healthcare costs , a figure that has doubled since 2003 , The Hill reported.The report said that rising deductibles is the biggest problem for those considered underinsured , even with the advent of Obamacare . `` The steady growth in the proliferation and size of deductibles threatens to increase underinsurance in the years ahead , '' the report warns , according to The Hill.The survey also found that people who purchase the lowest quality health coverage are also less likely to see a doctor when sick or injured because they fear high out-of-pocket costs . `` People who have high deductibles do tend to skimp on healthcare , '' the study 's lead author , Sara Collins , told reporters , according to The Hill.According to the report , half of underinsured adults and 41 percent of privately insured adults with deductibles of at least $ 1,000 had medical bills totaling $ 4,000 or more.The report casts doubt on the Obama administration 's promise that millions of people would gain access to affordable healthcare under Obamacare . Nevertheless , the report does not take account of the people who were uninsured before 2014 . `` We 're unable to separately assess the effects of the law with these data , '' Collins said , according to The Hill . `` What we 're seeing , though , in the data is ever-growing deductibles . `` Despite the increase in deductibles , healthcare costs overall have not risen as of late , something which the Obama administration has taken partial credit for , The Hill said.Specifically , the rate of those underinsured has flattened over the last several years , with the biggest increases in the underinsured population occurring between 2003 and 2010.The study found that those most likely to be underinsured are employed by small businesses , The Hill reported .",
