With the supply of unemployed dwindling , companies appear to be finally putting up generous enough pay raises to attract and retain employees .\nAverage hourly wages rose 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier , the fastest annual gain since 2009 .\nStill , inflation has picked up a bit in the past year as well , eating away at some of those pay raises .
