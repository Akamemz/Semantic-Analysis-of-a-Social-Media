    "content": "'T is the season of joyful children , the unfortunate addition of candy canes to coffee drinks , and fancy DVD sets given by people who apparently are n't aware of streaming video . And also , pleas to help the homeless .\nThe way that last part repeats , year after year , can make it seem like homelessness is an entrenched , unchanging part of our society . But data from recent years shows the nature of the problem is shifting dramatically before our eyes .\nAccording to HUD , the number of people on the streets and in shelters on a single night in January has fallen for the past four years straight . Even more remarkably , the category that HUD terms chronic homelessness \u2014 people with mental or physical disabilities living without a home for extended periods , or repeatedly \u2014 has dropped 30 percent since 2007 , even as the nation went through a severe recession .\nBut there 's also another story about homelessness in America , told by a report from the National Center for Family Homelessness , that shows a record number of children are now homeless . That 's based on data from the Department of Education , which measures homelessness quite differently from HUD . Instead of just surveying streets and shelters , the DOE includes anyone who 's living doubled-up , couch-surfing with friends or extended family . Because of that , the scale of the problem depends on which source you 're looking at \u2014 almost 1.3 million homeless students by the DOE 's count , compared with HUD 's point-in-time estimate of 578,424 homeless people of all ages .\nStill , the way the two sets of numbers are trending reflects something kind of mind-boggling : As a nation , we may be on our way to solving the problem of homelessness for the toughest people to serve . Yet , at the same time , homelessness is on the rise among a separate group of people , with problems that seem , on the surface , much simpler .\nThat veteran who used to sleep under a bridge ? There 's a good chance he now has his own place , with access to health care and counseling . But meanwhile , a mom with a couple of kids down the street has moved in with her sister 's family , and one more fight over shared bedrooms could send them looking for somewhere else to stay .\nThe improvement in chronic homelessness is thanks largely to the adoption of `` housing first '' approaches that give people a place to live and then offer help with substance abuse and disabilities . Research has found this works much better than trying to offer services to people on the street before finding them housing . Over the past decade , groups working with the homeless have responded to the data and shifted gears .\n`` We 've gotten a lot better across the board , I think , with people with very special needs , '' said Nan Roman , president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness . `` There 's kind of a technology around that , permanent supportive housing . It turns out it 's really cost effective . ''\nLooking at recent victories , like the fact that both New York and New Orleans have cut veteran homelessness in half in just three years , Roman said she 's cautiously optimistic that homelessness among people with the greatest needs could be entirely eliminated .\nBut she said addressing homelessness among families is a whole different matter . Homeless families , mainly women and their kids , don \u2019 t experience mental health and substance abuse problems at anywhere near the rates of homeless individuals , so they don \u2019 t really need the same types of supports . In fact , homeless families look almost exactly like other low-income families .\n`` What you 're seeing is this massive pool of poor people who ca n't afford housing , '' Roman said . `` Some percent every year will have a crisis and fall into homelessness\u2026 . This is not really about homelessness ; this is about resolving housing crises for poor people . There 's going to be more of it because we 're just not dealing with the income-housing gap \u2014 people not having a living wage . ''\nEven though homelessness driven by economic need seems like a simpler problem than the chronic sort , it could be much harder to solve . Only a certain number of people live with serious disabilities . But , as pay rates at the lowest rungs of the economy stagnate , there are an almost unlimited number who could end up evicted after a few more rent hikes .\nThis is n't to say that no progress has been made in fighting family homelessness . Nationwide , by HUD 's count , the number of parents and kids living on the street is less than half what it was in 2007 , and the number in shelters has n't grown enough to account for this drop .\nMary Cunningham , a senior research associate at the Urban Institute 's Metropolitan Housing and Communities Center , said it 's not altogether clear where those families go when they leave the street . In some cases , they may be getting support from various agencies to help them stay in their own apartments .\nBut there 's also a suggestive bit of data in the HUD numbers : While family homelessness has generally fallen , there are a few places it 's risen steeply . In Washington , D.C. , HUD reports that the number of homeless parents and children rose from 1,603 in 2007 to 3,795 this year . In New York City , it jumped from 29,015 to 41,633 .\nRents in these cities are extraordinarily high , and rising fast , which may partly explain why they stand out . But Cunningham notes that there 's another difference . Both D.C. and New York have an unusual law guaranteeing a shelter bed to anyone who needs it \u2014 at least in dangerously cold weather . That means families that might otherwise be doubled-up or living in some other makeshift situation are more likely to end up in a shelter and get counted as officially homeless .\nPerhaps partly because of their right-to-shelter laws , Cunningham said , some shelters in the two cities have evolved to look kind of like very low-quality apartments .\n`` So in some ways the shelter has become de facto affordable housing for people who do n't have other options , '' she said . `` That is n't great because the quality is n't there . ''\nBut are these shelters worse than the alternative ? That 's not clear . Cunningham said that , in cities without the right to shelter , more doubling up may create other problems , including a stressful environment for everyone involved .\n`` Those are not healthy situations either , '' she said . `` It makes it hard for kids to go to school , stay on track in class . ''\nSakina Thompson , senior policy advisor for D.C. 's Department of Human Services , said the city has recently moved toward combining programs for families that are officially homeless and those that are simply poor , recognizing that they typically have the same needs .\n`` Families seeking homeless services look just like the families who don \u2019 t who also have low income , '' she said .\nFor example , Thompson said , city workers now assess the housing needs of every family that applies for the welfare program Temporary Assistance for Needy Families . It turns out that more than half of them are doubled-up and at risk of homelessness . Now the city can connect them with housing resources before they end up in a shelter .\nThe question is whether D.C. , and other high-cost communities , can provide enough support to keep families in their own apartments .\nThe largest federal affordable housing program for low-income people is Section 8 subsidies , which pay a portion of a household 's rent each month . But there are a limited number of the vouchers , and only a quarter of eligible families nationwide receive them . D.C. also has various affordable housing programs of its own , but Thompson said these resources are just not enough . The city 's housing authority had to close its wait list for public housing a year and a half ago because it had gotten so long .\nThe mismatch between affordable housing and the people who need it is only getting worse . Nationwide , more than a quarter of renters pay 50 percent or more of their income in rent , and the percentage has risen substantially in recent years .\n`` That puts people at higher risk , '' said Cunningham . `` If you 're paying too much for housing , you 're either making very difficult trade-offs about what else you 're forgoing , like food or health care , or you 're falling behind on your rent and you 're putting yourself at risk for becoming homeless . ''\nSo if we want to help the homeless this Christmas , the best thing we can do might be to work for justice for all Americans living with those choices .",
