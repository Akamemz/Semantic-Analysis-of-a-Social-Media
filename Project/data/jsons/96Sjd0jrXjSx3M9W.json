    "content": "Obamacare customers are gaming the system , buying coverage only after they find out they \u2019 re ill and need expensive care \u2014 a trend insurers warn is destabilizing the fledgling health law marketplaces and spiking premiums for everyone .\nInsurers blame the problem on lax rules that allow more than 900,000 people to sign up for coverage outside the standard enrollment season \u2014 for instance , when they change jobs or move \u2014 without sufficient proof they are eligible . No one knows precisely how many might be manipulating the system , but the plans say they run up much higher medical bills and then jump ship , contributing to double-digit rate increases and financial losses .\nHealth plans also complain some customers are exploiting a three-month `` grace period '' \u2014 when they can keep getting subsidized coverage even if they \u2019 ve stopped paying their share of premiums .\nBoth those trends make the risk pools skew toward sicker , costlier customers \u2014 and under Obamacare , plans can no longer deny coverage to those with expensive medical conditions . That problem has been exacerbated by the large numbers of healthier people who are choosing to stay uninsured rather than shell out money for coverage .\nThe issue represents a huge challenge for the Obama administration , which faces a delicate balancing act in regulating the exchanges . On the one hand , it wants as many people as possible to sign up for coverage since that 's the main goal of the Affordable Care Act . But it also needs to make sure that the insurance companies see the exchanges as worthwhile markets in which to compete .\nIn a speech Monday night , Andy Slavitt , acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services , which oversees the exchanges , acknowledged the problems and said the administration would tighten the rules for special enrollments \u2014 and terminate coverage for those who found to have signed up improperly .\n`` There are some [ special enrollment periods ] that we need to clarify because they 're subject frankly to abuse , '' Slavitt said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco . `` There may be bad actors and others out there who are abusing those .
