( Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters )\nMany people benefit from the lawbreaking : The Mexican and Central American governments , the Democratic party , employers , ethnic activists , rich progressives , and the illegal border crossers themselves .\nAlmost every party invested in open borders proves utterly selfish , without regard for the legitimate interests of others or of the law itself .\nThe immigrant is the pawn of Latin American governments who view him as inanimate capital , someone who represents thousands of dollars in future foreign-exchange remittances , as well as one less mouth to feed at home \u2014 if he crosses the border , legality be damned . If that sounds a cruel or cynical appraisal , then why would the Mexican government in 2005 print a comic booklet ( \u201c Guide for the Mexican Migrant \u201d ) with instructions to its citizens on how best to cross into the United States \u2014 urging them to break American law and assuming that they could not read ?\nYet for all the savagery dealt out to the immigrant \u2014 the callousness of his government , the shakedowns of the coyotes and cartels , the exploitation of his labor by new American employers \u2014 the immigrant himself is not entirely innocent . He knows \u2014 or does not care to know \u2014 that by entering the U.S. , he has taken a slot from a would-be legal immigrant , one , unlike himself , who played by the rules and waited years in line for his chance to become an American .\nHe knowingly violates U.S. immigration law . And when the first act of an immigrant is to enter the U.S. illegally , the second to reside there unlawfully , and the third so often to adopt false identities , he undermines American law on the expectation that he will receive exemptions not accorded to U.S. citizens , much less to other legal immigrants . In terms of violations of federal law , and crimes such as hit-and-run accidents and identity theft , the illegal immigrant is overrepresented in the criminal-justice system , and indeed in federal penitentiaries .\nCertainly , no Latin American government would allow foreigners to enter , reside , and work in their own country in the manner that they expect their own citizens to do so in America . Historically , the Mexican constitution , to take one example , discriminates in racial terms against both the legal and illegal immigrants , in medieval terms of ethnic essence .\nSome $ 30 billion in remittances are sent back by mostly illegal aliens to Central American governments and roughly another $ 30 billion to Mexico . But the full implications of that exploitation are rarely appreciated . Most impoverished illegal aliens who send such staggering sums back not only entered the United States illegally and live here illegally , but they often enjoy some sort of local , state , or federal subsidy . They work at entry-level jobs with the understanding that they are to scrimp and save , with the assistance of the American taxpayer , whose laws they have shredded , so that they can send cash to their relatives and friends back home .\nIn other words , the remitters are like modern indentured servants , helots in hock to their governments that either will not or can not help their families and are excused from doing so thanks to such massive remittances .\nRemittances also explain the hostility of our southern neighbors , who will do almost anything to prevent their cessation .\nIn sum , they promote illegal immigration to earn such foreign exchange , to create an expatriate community in the United States that will romanticize a Guatemala or Oaxaca \u2014 all the more so , the longer and farther they are away from it . Few of the impoverished in Mexico paste a Mexican-flag sticker on their window shield ; many do so upon arrival in the United States . Illegal immigration is a safety valve , by which dissidents are thanked for marching north rather than on their own nations \u2019 capitals .\nLatin American governments really do not care that much that their poor are raped while crossing the Mexican desert , or sold off by the drug cartels , or that they drown in the Rio Grande , but they suddenly weep when they reach American detention centers \u2014 a cynicism that literally cost hundreds their lives .\nIf thousands of the Mexican or Central American affluent were fleeing their homelands and taking their money and skills with them , their governments would probably be barring their passage .\nAmerica is increasingly becoming not so much a nonwhite nation as an assimilated , integrated , and intermarried country . Race , skin color , and appearance , if you will , are becoming irrelevant . The construct of \u201c Latino \u201d \u2014 Mexican-American ? Portuguese ? Spanish ? Brazilian ? \u2014 is becoming immaterial as diverse immigrants soon can not speak Spanish , lose all knowledge of Latin America , and become indistinguishable in America from the descendants of southern Europeans , Armenians , or any other Mediterranean immigrant group .\nIn other words , a Lopez or Martinez was rapidly becoming as relevant or irrelevant in terms of grievance politics , or perceived class , as a Pelosi , Scalise , De Niro , or Pacino . If Pelosi was named \u201c Ocasio-Cortez \u201d and AOC \u201c Pelosi , \u201d then no one would know , or much care , from their respective superficial appearance , who was of Puerto Rican background and who of Italian ancestry .\nSuch a melting-pot future terrifies the ethnic activists in politics , academia , and the media who count on replenishing the numbers of unassimilated \u201c Latinos , \u201d in order to announce themselves the champions of collective grievance and disparity and thereby find careerist advantage . When 1 million of some of the most impoverished people on the planet arrive without legality , a high-school diploma , capital , or English , then they are likely to remain poor for a generation . And their poverty then offers supposed proof that America is a nativist or racist society for allowing such asymmetry to occur \u2014 a social-justice crime remedied best the by Latino caucus , the Chicano-studies department , the La Raza lawyers association , or the former National Council of La Raza . Yet , curb illegal immigration , and the entire Latino race industry goes the way of the Greek- , Armenian- , or Portuguese-American communities that have all found parity once massive immigration of their impoverished countrymen ceased and the formidable powers of the melting pot were uninterrupted .\nIf Latino immigrants were of the conservative upper-middle class , as refugees fleeing socialist tyranny , arriving with English fluency , legality , and capital , then the current Latino ethnic industry would oppose open borders and its activists perhaps would go to the border to turn them away .\nDemocrats once were exclusionists \u2014 largely because they feared that illegal immigration eroded unionization and overtaxed the social-service resources of their poor citizen constituents . Cesar Chavez , for example , sent his thugs to the border to club illegal aliens and drive them back into Mexico , as if they were future strike breakers .
