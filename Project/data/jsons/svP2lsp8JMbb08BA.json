    "content": "Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith ( R-MI ) won her runoff election last night over Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi , so Republicans have a solid 53-47 majority . No longer will we have to deal with the Murkowski-Collins question when it come sot tight votes of judicial and Supreme Court nominations . We can run the table on paper , but we have a Sen. Jeff Flake ( R-AZ ) problem . Yeah , Mr. Flake , the perpetual pain in the rear end of the Senate GOP , isn \u2019 t budging from his position of blocking Trump \u2019 s judicial nominees until a vote on a bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the Russia investigation is brought before the Senate floor .\nHis antics caused the Senate Judiciary Committee to cancel tomorrow \u2019 s hearing to advance 21 judicial nominees . Flake is the deciding vote on that committee , and he \u2019 s starting to annoy the hell out of his Republican colleagues . Efforts to appease him seem to be a fool \u2019 s errand as binding legislation to protect Mueller is the only thing that will cause him to reverse course on his obstructionism over judicial nominees ( via Politico ) :\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee cancelled a Thursday hearing on judicial nominees as Jeff Flake \u2019 s stand for a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller continues to wreak havoc in the lame duck session . The panel was scheduled to advance six Circuit Court nominees , 15 District Court nominees and several bipartisan bills on Thursday to prepare them for possible floor action over the next month . But Flake , who is retiring at the end of this year , is holding firm to his vow to vote against judicial nominees on the floor and in committee unless Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) schedules a vote on the bipartisan special counsel legislation . Flake and Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del . ) attempted to bring up the bill on Wednesday and were blocked by Republicans that oppose it . Relatedly , Flake voted against Thomas Farr \u2019 s nomination to be a District Court judge on Wednesday afternoon , forcing Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie after wavering Sen. Tim Scott ( R-S.C. ) voted to advance Farr . Flake \u2019 s blockade is annoying senior Republicans by slowing down confirmation of conservative judges in the narrowly divided Senate . But Flake \u2019 s tactics have been effective because Republicans have a one-seat majority on the Judiciary Committee and control just 51 votes in the Senate , so he could have tagged some nominees with an \u201c unfavorable \u201d recommendation if Democrats unanimously opposed them .\nFor those who think Jeff Flake would have won in Arizona , let me remind you that his popularity in is state is straight trash , he barely won his 2012 race , and he most likely would have been picked off in a primary . Jeff Flake can not leave the Senate soon enough . Oh , and Flake and the late John McCain \u2019 s squishy antics seemed to have depressed Arizona GOP enthusiasm , so there \u2019 s that aspect . If Flake wants to run in 2020 , and there \u2019 s some speculation that he \u2019 s considering it , he better be prepared to be ripped apart by angry conservatives for going out of his way to torpedo the Republican agenda on the Hill to spite Trump . Oh , and expect to be speaking to just a handful of people who show up at his low energy rallies . Get lost , dude .\nFlake is causing problems now for GOP and is not buckling . Hearing on 21 lifetime noms cancelled over his judicial blockade https : //t.co/9gaYu4eBlB \u2014 Burgess Everett ( @ burgessev ) November 28 , 2018",
