The Pentagon identified the three now former prisoners resettled in Georgia as Abdel Ghaib Ahmad Hakim , Salah Mohammed Salih Al-Dhabi and Abdul Khaled Al-Baydani . The two sent to Slovakia were Hashim Bin Ali Bin Amor Sliti and Husayn Salim Muhammad Al-Mutari Yafai .\nHakim was the first prisoner from Yemen to be released since 2010 . Yemenis make up the majority of men cleared for release because the U.S. is reluctant to send prisoners to the unstable country .\nThe group was among dozens of low-level prisoners at Guantanamo who were determined to no longer pose a threat by an administration task force in 2009 .\nTheir release brings the total prison population to 143 , about 100 fewer than when President Barack Obama took office pledging to close the detention center .\nHowever Obama 's vow to close Guantanamo was opposed by many in Congress , and lawmakers imposed restrictions that brought releases to a halt .\nCongress eased the restrictions in December , and releases have resumed .
