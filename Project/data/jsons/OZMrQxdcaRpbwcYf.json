The Republicans now control Congress , the White House , and a majority of state governments , and they are about to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court . The Democrats ' political operation has turned out to be as hollow as a triple-A rating from Moody 's in 2006 . As the old clich\u00e9 goes , the Dems are in disarray .\nBut so are the Republicans . Donald Trump won the GOP nomination because the party had slipped from its gatekeepers ' grasp , and he broke with normal political behavior by continuing to blast away at his Republican rivals even after accepting the nomination . It would n't be true to say that he owes nothing to the party establishment\u2014the RNC certainly gave him crucial on-the-ground assistance at the end of the campaign\u2014but he won the election on his own terms and clearly does n't feel obliged to pay obeisance to anyone . He could conceivably decide to focus on the issues that interest him and let the usual Republican suspects set the agenda for everything else ; he could just as conceivably treat Paul Ryan ( or Ryan 's successor ) as the head of another opposition party .\nAnd Trump himself is vulnerable to the same sort of storm that propelled him into office .
