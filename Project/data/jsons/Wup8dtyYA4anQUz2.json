    "content": "A letter from Senate Republicans to Iranian leaders sparked a furious response from the White House on Monday , with administration officials accusing the GOP of seeking war and undermining its diplomatic efforts to stop Iran \u2019 s pursuit of a nuclear weapon .\nIn their letter , 47 Senate Republicans , led by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas , told Tehran that any nuclear deal that isn \u2019 t submitted to Congress \u2014 as now seems likely \u2014 would not last into the next administration and would not represent the kind of historic , lasting agreement President Obama envisions .\nThe flap comes just a week after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress at the invitation of House Republicans and warned against striking a deal with Iran . Mr. Obama refused a meeting with Mr. Netanyahu , and the White House condemned the speech , deepening already clear battle lines between the White House and congressional Republicans over foreign policy .\nBut that battle reached new heights Monday . Congressional Democrats said their GOP counterparts issued a \u201c hard slap \u201d to the face of the administration by communicating directly with Tehran , while Iranian leaders accused Republicans of standing in the way of peace .\nMr. Obama said the Republicans now effectively have aligned themselves with Iranian leaders in trying to pour cold water on a potentially fruitful diplomatic endeavor .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hard-liners in Iran . It \u2019 s an unusual coalition , \u201d Mr. Obama said just before a closed-door meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk . \u201c I think what we \u2019 re going to focus on right now is actually seeing whether we can get a deal or not . And once we do \u2014 if we do \u2014 then we \u2019 ll be able to make the case to the American people , and I \u2019 m confident we \u2019 ll be able to implement it . \u201d\nNegotiations between Iran and the so-called P5+1 \u2014 the U.S. , Russia , China , France , Germany and Britain \u2014 are scheduled to resume next week in Switzerland , with just under four months until a June 30 deadline , although that deadline already had been pushed back multiple times .\nThe coalition hopes to halt Iran \u2019 s uranium-enrichment program for at least the next decade . In exchange , the U.S. and its partners gradually would begin to lighten economic sanctions against Tehran , though Congress would have to sign off on lifting many of the stiffest sanctions .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emphasized that point Sunday on \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on CBS , saying that while it \u2019 s obvious \u201c the president doesn \u2019 t want us involved in this \u2026 he \u2019 s going to need us if he \u2019 s going to lift any of the existing sanctions . \u2026 He can not work around Congress forever . \u201d\nNevertheless , the administration has repeatedly maintained it can strike a deal with Iran without congressional approval , and has given no indication it will seek a vote on Capitol Hill .\nAmid the uncertainty and admissions by the administration that Iran can \u2019 t fully be trusted , Mr. Obama has maintained that the chances of an agreement are 50-50 at best . They now say those chances could be reduced as a result of Monday \u2019 s letter , which was a showing of near-unity among the Senate GOP in opposition to the president \u2019 s approach to Tehran .\n\u201c We will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei , \u201d the senators wrote in the open letter . \u201c The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time . \u201d\nReaction to the letter , from the White House , Tehran and among Capitol Hill Democrats , was fierce .\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Republicans are undermining the president \u2019 s efforts for a diplomatic agreement and , in essence , trying to set the stage for yet another war in the Middle East .\n\u201c The president is trying to explore this diplomatic option with Iran , alongside our international partners , because it is in the best interest of the United States , \u201d he told reporters . \u201c The rush to war \u2014 or , at least , the rush to the military option that many Republicans are advocating \u2014 is not at all in the best interest of the United States . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the Iranian regime lumped congressional Republicans in with Mr. Netanyahu , painting them all as war-hungry politicians set on derailing the \u201c peace \u201d process at any cost .\n\u201c In our view , this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy , \u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said in a report from Iran \u2019 s state news service . \u201c It is very interesting that while negotiations are still in progress , and while no agreement has been reached , some political pressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods , unprecedented in diplomatic history .
