    "content": "Bobby Jindal is Indian-American , but you \u2019 ll never hear him describe himself that way . Marco Rubio insists he \u2019 s an \u201c American of Hispanic descent. \u201d And Ted Cruz \u201c certainly \u201d identifies as Hispanic , but he didn \u2019 t run for office as \u201c the Hispanic guy . \u201d\nThese Republican lawmakers , along with African-American conservative favorite Ben Carson , look poised to make the 2016 GOP presidential field the party \u2019 s most diverse ever . They are all mulling over White House runs as the GOP continues to struggle with minority voters and as racial tensions over police conduct have captivated the nation .\nBut none is planning to play up his race or ethnicity in a presidential campaign , or even to stress the potentially historic nature of his candidacy . Instead , according to interviews with donors , strategists , aides and several of the possible candidates themselves , each is more likely to hit broader themes such as the American dream and the importance of hard work , which , for Jindal , Cruz and Rubio , would include nods to their parents \u2019 immigrant experience .\nSuch messages would , in theory , have more universal appeal by stressing the commonalities of the American experience instead of its divisions \u2014 while also avoiding the identity politics that are toxic among GOP primary voters . It \u2019 s a tactic that may be welcomed as an expression of unity by some minorities , but it is already seen by others , especially advocates for immigrants , as dismissive of unique hardships facing their communities .\nIn a 25-minute interview , Cruz described his approach this way : \u201c When I ran for Senate , I didn \u2019 t run as , \u2018 vote for the Hispanic guy. \u2019 I ran as the strongest conservative in the race \u2026 Now , is the fact that my father came as an immigrant from Cuba , penniless , seeking the American dream , an integral part of who I am ? Absolutely . \u201d\nCruz \u2019 s success in deep-red Texas in 2012 , however , came as the GOP was trounced among minority voters ; presidential nominee Mitt Romney captured just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote , which was still significantly higher than what he earned among blacks , whose robust turnout levels helped reelect Barack Obama , the first African-American president .\nRepublican leaders say they have invested significantly in reaching out to minorities , but the party continues to struggle among those groups , and GOP lawmakers \u2019 overall resistance to comprehensive immigration reform has frustrated Hispanics in particular . So the fact that the party \u2019 s emerging 2016 field could be so diverse is striking .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a fascinating twist given the rap on the GOP , that it \u2019 s just a party of white men , \u201d said Whit Ayres , who consults for Rubio .\nLike Cruz , his colleague in the Senate , Rubio is the child of Cuban immigrants ; Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , was born to Hindus who immigrated from India ; Carson grew up in inner-city Detroit and ultimately became a famed pediatric neurosurgeon .\nRubio is perhaps the most open about his heritage . The Florida senator grew up in Miami and Las Vegas , appears on Spanish-language media and often discusses his parents \u2019 experiences as immigrants .\nHe led the charge to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Democratic-controlled Senate , though he later backed off the proposal , which got nowhere in the GOP-controlled House and raised fury among the conservative base . This past week , Rubio emerged as the leading GOP opponent of the White House \u2019 s decision to normalize relations with Cuba \u2014 a highly charged issue among Cuban exiles in Florida .\nBut don \u2019 t expect Rubio to tout himself as the \u201c first Hispanic-American candidate . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m proud of my culture , I \u2019 m proud of my heritage , I \u2019 m proud of where I come from , \u201d Rubio said in an interview . \u201c One of the great things about America is it allows you to keep all of those things , influence our society , but ultimately we \u2019 re united by this common strain \u2026 We \u2019 re united by what I think is a common aspiration : That is , ensure everyone has an equal opportunity for a better life . \u201d\nCruz also uses the framework of the American dream when he discusses his father \u2019 s rise from penury to success in his adopted country \u2014 a concept Cruz suggested will inform his overall message to voters should he run in 2016 .\n\u201c A point I made repeatedly on the campaign trail was , my entire life , my father has been my hero , but what I find most remarkable about his story is how commonplace it is , \u201d Cruz said when asked to preview his message . \u201c Every one of us is the child of those seeking freedom . That \u2019 s what ties us together as Americans . \u201d\nBut Cruz \u2019 s hard-line stance against immigration reform disqualifies him among many Hispanics .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not enough to be of Hispanic descent , you have to actually understand where someone \u2019 s coming from \u2014 be able to identify with them , \u201d said Maria Teresa Kumar , the head of the Hispanic young voter advocacy group Voto Latino . \u201c And all we unfortunately hear from Ted Cruz is , \u2018 we have to close the border , \u2019 \u2018 the crime of being undocumented. \u2019 It \u2019 s hard for Latino voters to swallow . \u201d\nThe Texas senator , a favorite of social conservatives and the tea party , however , sees no conflict between appealing to minorities and his secure-the-border first position , casting the latter as a matter of the rule of law . Cruz says that , according to his internal numbers , he outperformed Romney among Hispanics in Texas in 2012 .\n\u201c If Republicans are perceived as the Democratic caricature tries to paint us \u2014 as rich , out-of-touch kleptocrats \u2014 we lose , and we lose in the Hispanic community , \u201d he said . \u201c If we are instead perceived as , and actually fighting for , working men and women \u2026 people struggling to climb the economic ladder but filled with hopes and dreams to achieve the American dream , that \u2019 s how we win nationally but also how we win in the Hispanic community . \u201d\nIf Jindal decides to run , he , too , will most likely offer a pitch centered on restoring the American dream \u2014 bolstered with stories about his parents \u2019 immigrant experience \u2014 but he won \u2019 t specifically highlight his Indian background , said Timmy Teepell , partner at OnMessage Inc. and former chief of staff to the governor .\n\u201c As a son of immigrants , he never took for granted the fact that they got to live in America , \u201d Teepell said of Jindal . \u201c That has had a profound impact on him \u2026 He \u2019 s the first Indian-American governor in the country \u2019 s history . That \u2019 s fantastic , but that \u2019 s not why he ran for governor . He ran for governor because there weren \u2019 t enough opportunities in Louisiana for people to pursue the American dream . \u201d\nNeither Ben Carson , Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz is planning to play up his race or ethnicity in a presidential campaign . | Getty and AP Photos\nThe Louisiana governor , who changed his name from Piyush to Bobby as a child and later converted to Catholicism , said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he \u2019 s \u201c against the idea of hyphenated Americans . \u201d\n\u201c My parents immigrated to this country some 40 years ago looking for two things \u2014 freedom and opportunity , \u201d he added . \u201c You know where they found it ? Baton Rouge , Louisiana . It is considered naive these days to talk about America as the great melting pot . But the fact is , that is the right construct . It \u2019 s not our skin color or ethnic heritage that binds us together . It \u2019 s our shared desire for freedom , for colorblind justice and for opportunity for everyone \u2014 regardless of our race , the income level of our family or the circumstances of our birth . \u201d\nCompared to Jindal , Cruz , Rubio and most others in the emerging 2016 GOP field , Carson \u2019 s chances of gaining the nomination are virtually nill . Still , if he runs , he also isn \u2019 t expected to talk about much about race , although he may emphasize his story of working his way out of poverty and into medicine , where he earned plaudits for his expertise in separating conjoined twins .\nStrategists close to Carson suggested that he would bring more blacks into GOP politics simply by asking for their vote . \u201c I \u2019 m trying to think if he \u2019 s ever mentioned that he \u2019 s black , \u201d said Vernon Robinson , campaign director for the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t talk about race . \u201d\nThe Democrats have recent experience with \u201c historic \u201d candidacies : The 2008 Democratic primary saw both a woman , Hillary Clinton , and an African-American , Obama , win major swaths of the party vote .
