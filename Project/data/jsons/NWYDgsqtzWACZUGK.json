The facts are broken down into four sections :\nBelow are the facts about immigrants today : who they are , where they live , and their impact on the U.S. economy .\nThere were 39.9 million foreign-born people in the United States in 2010 . 44 percent were naturalized citizens . 24 percent were legal permanent residents . 29 percent were unauthorized migrants . 3 percent were temporary legal residents ( such as students or temporary workers ) .\n50.9 percent of our nation \u2019 s foreign born are women and 54.2 percent of naturalized foreign-born persons are women .\nThe foreign-born share of the overall U.S. population is 12.9 percent today , lower than the highest percentage ( 14.8 percent ) achieved in 1890 .\nMost immigrants have made a home in the United States\n11.5 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States in January 2011 , an increase of one-third since 2000 , when there were 8.5 million undocumented immigrants .\n, an increase of one-third since 2000 , when there were 8.5 million undocumented immigrants . 86 percent of undocumented immigrants have been living in the United States for seven years or longer .\n5.2 percent of the U.S. labor force consisted of undocumented immigrants in 2010 , even though they comprise only 3.7 percent of the nation \u2019 s population .\n, even though they comprise only 3.7 percent of the nation \u2019 s population . 45 percent of unauthorized immigrant households are composed of couples with children .

Traditional \u201c gateway \u201d states such as California , Illinois , Texas , New York , and Florida continue to be home to large percentages of our nation \u2019 s foreign-born . But immigrants are increasingly dispersing to metropolitan areas outside these states . Fifteen states\u2014Alabama , Arkansas , Colorado , Delaware , Georgia , Idaho , Kentucky , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , Tennessee , South Carolina , and Utah\u2014experienced at least a 200 percent increase in their immigrant populations between 1990 and 2009 .

( see chart above ) The number of undocumented Mexican nationals arriving to the United States declined by 80 percent between 2004 and 2010 . In 2010 fewer than 100,000 Mexican nationals settled in the United States , compared to an annual flow of about 525,000 undocumented persons from Mexico from 2000 to 2004 .\nIn 2010 fewer than 100,000 Mexican nationals settled in the United States , compared to an annual flow of about 525,000 undocumented persons from Mexico from 2000 to 2004 . Increased enforcement isn \u2019 t encouraging immigrants to return home . Immigration from Mexico is at net zero , with slightly more Mexicans leaving the country than entering it . This decline in immigration can be attributed to tightened border controls , weak job and housing construction markets in the United States , increases in deportations , and declining Mexican birthrates .\nImmigration from Mexico is at net zero , with slightly more Mexicans leaving the country than entering it .

Policies of \u201c self-deportation \u201d do not lead to large-scale resettlement .

Immigrants , like other economic actors , are averse to losing their long-term investments . These include investments in homes or their children \u2019 s education , for example . Research drawing on cognitive psychology and behavioral economics has shown that this is another reason undocumented immigrants do not leave even in the face of harsh laws .\nThese include investments in homes or their children \u2019 s education , for example . Research drawing on cognitive psychology and behavioral economics has shown that this is another reason undocumented immigrants do not leave even in the face of harsh laws . Instead of leaving the United States , undocumented immigrants living in anti-immigrant states move to friendlier neighboring states . An abundance of anecdotal evidence stemming from a number of anti-immigrant measures has led researchers to believe that when migrants feel targeted , they resettle elsewhere in the United States .\n$ 1.5 trillion \u2014The amount of money that would be added to U.S. cumulative gross domestic product over 10 years with a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes legalization for all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States .\n\u2014The amount of money that would be added to U.S. cumulative gross domestic product over 10 years with a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes legalization for all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States . $ 11.2 billion \u2014The amount of money households headed by unauthorized immigrants paid in state and local taxes in 2010 .\n\u2014The amount of money households headed by unauthorized immigrants paid in state and local taxes in 2010 . $ 4.5 billion to $ 5.4 billion\u2014The amount of additional net tax revenue that would accrue to the federal government over three years if all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States were legalized .\n$ 2.6 trillion \u2014The amount of money that would evaporate from U.S. cumulative GDP over 10 years if all undocumented immigrants in the country were deported or \u201c self-deport . \u201d\n\u2014The amount of money that would evaporate from U.S. cumulative GDP over 10 years if all undocumented immigrants in the country were deported or \u201c self-deport. \u201d $ 285 billion \u2014The cost of removing the entire undocumented population from the United States over a five-year period , including continued border- and interior-enforcement efforts .\n\u2014The cost of removing the entire undocumented population from the United States over a five-year period , including continued border- and interior-enforcement efforts . $ 23,482\u2014The cost of apprehending , detaining , processing , and transporting one individual in deportation proceedings .\nThe Obama administration has directed an unprecedented amount of resources to ensuring our southern border is secure and undocumented immigrants ( criminal and noncriminal ) are deported . In June 2012 the Department of Homeland Security announced they would allow DREAM Act-eligible youth to apply for deferred action , granting them protection against deportation and the ability to get work authorization .\nNotwithstanding these efforts , in the absence of lasting solutions that fix our broken immigration system , state legislators have passed a wide array of immigration measures , ranging from Arizona \u2019 s famous \u201c papers please \u201d measure that has risen to the U.S. Supreme Court , to immigrant-friendly DREAM Act measures .\n81 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border meets one of the top three levels of \u201c operational control \u201d by U.S. enforcement officials . The remaining 19 percent covers the most remote , inaccessible , and inhospitable stretches of the border .

According to the Pew Hispanic Center , 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States from 2005 to 2010 , while approximately 1.4 million Mexicans moved from the United States to Mexico in that same period of time .\nThe federal government \u2019 s voluntary web-based system that allows employers to verify the work authorization of their employees is used by 4 percent of all businesses in the United States . Some members of Congress are pushing to make E-Verify mandatory for every employer in the country , but a debate exists about the accuracy of the databases and the Congressional Budget Office estimated the program would cost $ 17.3 billion in revenue over 10 years .\nSome members of Congress are pushing to make E-Verify mandatory for every employer in the country , but a debate exists about the accuracy of the databases and the Congressional Budget Office estimated the program would cost $ 17.3 billion in revenue over 10 years . The federal government has stepped up enforcement against employers who hire undocumented workers through auditing of I-9 forms , the federal paperwork that must be completed by all workers and employers upon hiring . Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted 2,196 Form I-9 inspections in FY 2010 compared to 1,444 in FY 2009 . These inspections led to 196 arrests ; $ 42.9 million in fines , forfeitures , and restitutions ; and many undocumented immigrants losing their jobs .\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement conducted 2,196 Form I-9 inspections in FY 2010 compared to 1,444 in FY 2009 .

The Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s immigration enforcement program , Secure Communities , has been aggressively expanded under the Obama administration . The Secure Communities program checks the immigration status of immigrants booked into county jails in participating jurisdictions . It is largely thanks to this program that the Obama administration has deported over 1 million people . DHS has expanded the Secure Communities program from 14 jurisdictions in 2008 to over 3,000 in 2012 , and will deploy the program to every jurisdiction across the country by 2013 . But several states and counties including Washington , D.C. , are putting up a fight , arguing the program interferes with local policing priorities and inevitably leads to racial profiling .\nThe Secure Communities program checks the immigration status of immigrants booked into county jails in participating jurisdictions .

There has been a significant increase in the number of detained noncriminal immigrants . In 2010 , 363,064 immigrants were detained , more than twice the 2005 level of detentions . The average cost to detain one person for an average of 30 days is $ 3,355 .\nIn the absence of federal action , states have filled the legislative gap with their own measures\nArizona , Utah , Georgia , Indiana , Alabama , and South Carolina have enacted immigration enforcement laws that target undocumented immigrants and increase the authority of local police to enact immigration enforcement policies .\nhave enacted immigration enforcement laws that target undocumented immigrants and increase the authority of local police to enact immigration enforcement policies . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled to strike down three parts of Arizona \u2019 s S.B . 1070 in June 2012 . But the decision left in place Section 2 ( B ) of the law , a dangerous provision that leaves the door open to racial profiling and harassment of people of color in Arizona .\nBut the decision left in place Section 2 ( B ) of the law , a dangerous provision that leaves the door open to racial profiling and harassment of people of color in Arizona . Though the measures have undoubtedly created a deeply hostile climate for all people of color , citizen or not , in these states there is no evidence that undocumented immigrants have left the United States .\nArizona \u2019 s S.B . 1070 passed in April 2010 . Arizona lost $ 141 million due to conference cancellations and loss of attendees due to backlash to its immigration law .

Alabama \u2019 s H.B . 56 , the nation \u2019 s toughest immigration law , was passed in June 2011 . Though a federal court has put a temporary hold on many of the most severe provisions of the law , an Alabama district judge allowed some extreme measures to go into effect in the fall of 2011 , causing much damage to the state \u2019 s economy , society , and reputation . It \u2019 s estimated that the state economy will lose up to $ 10.8 billion ( 6.2 percent of its GDP ) and up to 140,000 jobs .\nThough a federal court has put a temporary hold on many of the most severe provisions of the law , an Alabama district judge allowed some extreme measures to go into effect in the fall of 2011 , causing much damage to the state \u2019 s economy , society , and reputation .

Other states are addressing immigrant communities \u2019 real needs by passing state-level DREAM Acts .

This decline in immigration can be attributed to tightened border controls, weak job and housing construction markets in the United States, increases in deportations, and declining Mexican birthrates.\n\nImmigration from Mexico is at net zero, with slightly more Mexicans leaving the country than entering it.

Policies of \u201cself-deportation\u201d do not lead to large-scale resettlement. Immigrants make the decision to stay because most have been in the country for more than a decade, live in families with children, and know that if economic conditions are bad in this country, they are worse in their home countries.\n\nImmigrants make the decision to stay because most have been in the country for more than a decade, live in families with children, and know that if economic conditions are bad in this country, they are worse in their home countries. Immigrants, like other economic actors, are averse to losing their long-term investments. These include investments in homes or their children\u2019s education, for example. Research drawing on cognitive psychology and behavioral economics has shown that this is another reason undocumented immigrants do not leave even in the face of harsh laws.\n\nThese include investments in homes or their children\u2019s education, for example. Research drawing on cognitive psychology and behavioral economics has shown that this is another reason undocumented immigrants do not leave even in the face of harsh laws. Instead of leaving the United States, undocumented immigrants living in anti-immigrant states move to friendlier neighboring states. An abundance of anecdotal evidence stemming from a number of anti-immigrant measures has led researchers to believe that when migrants feel targeted, they resettle elsewhere in the United States.\n\nImmigrants are a net plus for our economy\n\n$1.5 trillion \u2014The amount of money that would be added to U.S. cumulative gross domestic product over 10 years with a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes legalization for all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.\n\n\u2014The amount of money that would be added to U.S. cumulative gross domestic product over 10 years with a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes legalization for all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States. $11.2 billion \u2014The amount of money households headed by unauthorized immigrants paid in state and local taxes in 2010.\n\n\u2014The amount of money households headed by unauthorized immigrants paid in state and local taxes in 2010. $4.5 billion to $5.4 billion\u2014The amount of additional net tax revenue that would accrue to the federal government over three years if all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States were legalized.\n\nIn contrast\u2026\n\n$2.6 trillion \u2014The amount of money that would evaporate from U.S. cumulative GDP over 10 years if all undocumented immigrants in the country were deported or \u201cself-deport.\u201d\n\n\u2014The amount of money that would evaporate from U.S. cumulative GDP over 10 years if all undocumented immigrants in the country were deported or \u201cself-deport.\u201d $285 billion \u2014The cost of removing the entire undocumented population from the United States over a five-year period, including continued border- and interior-enforcement efforts.\n\n\u2014The cost of removing the entire undocumented population from the United States over a five-year period, including continued border- and interior-enforcement efforts. $23,482\u2014The cost of apprehending, detaining, processing, and transporting one individual in deportation proceedings.\n\nCurrent federal and state immigration policy\n\nThe Obama administration has directed an unprecedented amount of resources to ensuring our southern border is secure and undocumented immigrants (criminal and noncriminal) are deported. In June 2012 the Department of Homeland Security announced they would allow DREAM Act-eligible youth to apply for deferred action, granting them protection against deportation and the ability to get work authorization.\n\nNotwithstanding these efforts, in the absence of lasting solutions that fix our broken immigration system, state legislators have passed a wide array of immigration measures, ranging from Arizona\u2019s famous \u201cpapers please\u201d measure that has risen to the U.S. Supreme Court, to immigrant-friendly DREAM Act measures.\n\nOur borders are safer than ever\n\n81 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border meets one of the top three levels of \u201coperational control\u201d by U.S. enforcement officials. The remaining 19 percent covers the most remote, inaccessible, and inhospitable stretches of the border. And according to 2010 FBI crime reports, there has been a 40 percent decline in violent crime rates in Southwest border states in the last two decades.\n\nThe remaining 19 percent covers the most remote, inaccessible, and inhospitable stretches of the border.

According to the Pew Hispanic Center, 1.4 million Mexicans immigrated to the United States from 2005 to 2010, while approximately 1.4 million Mexicans moved from the United States to Mexico in that same period of time.\n\nInterior and workplace-enforcement tools are on overdrive\n\nThe federal government\u2019s voluntary web-based system that allows employers to verify the work authorization of their employees is used by 4 percent of all businesses in the United States. Some members of Congress are pushing to make E-Verify mandatory for every employer in the country, but a debate exists about the accuracy of the databases and the Congressional Budget Office estimated the program would cost $17.3 billion in revenue over 10 years.\n\nSome members of Congress are pushing to make E-Verify mandatory for every employer in the country, but a debate exists about the accuracy of the databases and the Congressional Budget Office estimated the program would cost $17.3 billion in revenue over 10 years. The federal government has stepped up enforcement against employers who hire undocumented workers through auditing of I-9 forms, the federal paperwork that must be completed by all workers and employers upon hiring. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted 2,196 Form I-9 inspections in FY 2010 compared to 1,444 in FY 2009. These inspections led to 196 arrests; $42.9 million in fines, forfeitures, and restitutions; and many undocumented immigrants losing their jobs.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement conducted 2,196 Form I-9 inspections in FY 2010 compared to 1,444 in FY 2009.

The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s immigration enforcement program, Secure Communities, has been aggressively expanded under the Obama administration. The Secure Communities program checks the immigration status of immigrants booked into county jails in participating jurisdictions. It is largely thanks to this program that the Obama administration has deported over 1 million people. DHS has expanded the Secure Communities program from 14 jurisdictions in 2008 to over 3,000 in 2012, and will deploy the program to every jurisdiction across the country by 2013. But several states and counties including Washington, D.C., are putting up a fight, arguing the program interferes with local policing priorities and inevitably leads to racial profiling.\n\nThe Secure Communities program checks the immigration status of immigrants booked into county jails in participating jurisdictions.

There has been a significant increase in the number of detained noncriminal immigrants. In 2010, 363,064 immigrants were detained, more than twice the 2005 level of detentions. The average cost to detain one person for an average of 30 days is $3,355.\n\nIn the absence of federal action, states have filled the legislative gap with their own measures\n\nArizona, Utah, Georgia, Indiana, Alabama, and South Carolina have enacted immigration enforcement laws that target undocumented immigrants and increase the authority of local police to enact immigration enforcement policies.\n\nhave enacted immigration enforcement laws that target undocumented immigrants and increase the authority of local police to enact immigration enforcement policies. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled to strike down three parts of Arizona\u2019s S.B. 1070 in June 2012.

Though the measures have undoubtedly created a deeply hostile climate for all people of color, citizen or not, in these states there is no evidence that undocumented immigrants have left the United States.\n\nArizona\u2019s S.B. 1070 passed in April 2010. Arizona lost $141 million due to conference cancellations and loss of attendees due to backlash to its immigration law.

Alabama\u2019s H.B. 56, the nation\u2019s toughest immigration law, was passed in June 2011. Though a federal court has put a temporary hold on many of the most severe provisions of the law, an Alabama district judge allowed some extreme measures to go into effect in the fall of 2011, causing much damage to the state\u2019s economy, society, and reputation. It\u2019s estimated that the state economy will lose up to $10.8 billion (6.2 percent of its GDP) and up to 140,000 jobs.\n\nThough a federal court has put a temporary hold on many of the most severe provisions of the law, an Alabama district judge allowed some extreme measures to go into effect in the fall of 2011, causing much damage to the state\u2019s economy, society, and reputation.
