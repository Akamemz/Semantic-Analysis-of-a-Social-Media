This article was co-published with Portland Monthly .\nThree women say they faced sexual misconduct by Gordon Sondland before he was the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and at the center of the presidential impeachment inquiry . They say he retaliated against them professionally after they rejected his advances .\nIn one case , a potential business partner recalls that Sondland took her to tour a room in a hotel he owns , only to then grab her face and try to kiss her . After she rejected him , Sondland backtracked on investing in her business .\nAnother woman , a work associate at the time , says Sondland exposed himself to her during a business interaction . She also recalls falling over the back of a couch trying to get away from him . After she made her lack of interest clear , she says Sondland called her , screaming about her job performance .\nA third woman , 27 years Sondland \u2019 s junior , met him to discuss a potential job . She says he pushed himself against her and kissed her . She shoved him away . She says his job help stopped .\nAll three women have agreed to be named in this story . In all the cases , friends , family members or colleagues of the women recall being told about the encounters at the time . The cases span a seven-year period , ending less than a decade ago . Sondland denies the allegations .\n\u201c In decades of my career in business and civic affairs , my conduct can be affirmed by hundreds of employees and colleagues with whom I have worked in countless circumstances , \u201d Sondland said in a statement . \u201c These untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and , I believe , coordinated for political purposes . They have no basis in fact , and I categorically deny them. \u201d ( Read his statement . )\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nSondland \u2019 s lawyer added in a letter : \u201c Notably , what each of these three women share in common is that they pursued Ambassador Sondland for financial and personal gain \u2014 an investment , a job , and insurance brokerage work \u2014 and he declined their proposals . \u201d\nThe lawyer , Jim McDermott , also wrote that the three women are trying to undermine Sondland \u2019 s latest testimony . \u201c Given the timing of your intended story , a reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that you are attempting to affect Ambassador Sondland \u2019 s credibility as a fact witness in the pending impeachment inquiry , \u201d McDermott wrote . \u201c Given the politically charged climate in which current events are unfolding , some might consider this to be veiled witness tampering . \u201d\nReporting on this story began in October , around the time of Sondland \u2019 s initial impeachment testimony , in which he backed the president \u2019 s assertion that there was no quid pro quo involving Ukraine .\nThe day after Sondland gave that testimony , Nicole Vogel spoke at the Day of the Girl Luncheon in Seattle , an event hosted by a regional nonprofit , Girls Inc. , whose mission is to inspire \u201c all girls to be strong , smart , and bold. \u201d Vogel decided to recount her Sondland story and name him .\nVogel also mentioned it to an editor at Portland Monthly , the co-publisher of this story , and she later spoke about it again at a breakfast event in Portland .\n\u201c There were a lot of indecent proposals when I was raising capital , but none as brazen as his , \u201d Vogel recalls . She encountered Sondland 16 years ago when she was trying to raise money to start her magazine . \u201c I have nothing to say about what he did or didn \u2019 t do [ involving Ukraine ] . But if people are asking what his moral character is , I have one more piece of evidence for them . \u201d\nThe women had kept their stories to their own circles , even after Sondland was nominated and vetted for an ambassadorship by a president who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women . The women say they were not contacted by the government for any background checks .\nIn 2003 , Vogel had an idea to start a magazine with her journalist brother that would chronicle Portland \u2019 s exploding art , culture and food scenes . She was 34 years old and fresh off a job at Move.com . Armed with full mock-ups of the magazine and detailed financial projections , the search for investors led her to Sondland .\nSondland has long been a power player in Portland , where he is one of the region \u2019 s most prominent business figures . He owns five hotels in Portland under the umbrella of the company he founded , Provenance Hotel Group . He was once asked at a panel why he got into the business . \u201c It combines all the elements that give me a reason to get up in the morning , \u201d Sondland said . \u201c You have food , you have wine , you have design , you have art , you have intrigue , you have sex . You have everything you can think of . \u201d\nProtesters rallying outside a Portland , Oregon , hotel managed by the company Sondland founded , Provenance Hotel Group , on Oct. 13 . ( Alex Milan Tracy/Sipa via AP Images )\nSondland is also a prominent philanthropist . He has served on several high-profile nonprofit boards , including as the chairman of the board of trustees of the Portland Art Museum . A prominent staircase there bears his name and that of his wife , Katherine Durant .\nAccording to Vogel , Sondland was helpful , connecting her with potential advertisers and investors . Then , in the spring of 2003 , he invited her to dinner at El Gaucho , a clubby , old-school steakhouse , requesting information on the business \u2019 s projected financials . Over dinner , he told her that he would invest his own money in the magazine , and that Portland needed people like her .\n\u201c Gordon had said that night that he was going to invest , \u201d Vogel recalls . \u201c And in fact , he said to me that he was interested in investing in the company , but that he was more interested in investing in me , because he felt as if Portland didn \u2019 t keep people of high ambition and talent . \u201d\nAfter dinner , Vogel remembers Sondland proposing a walk across the street to Hotel Lucia , which Provenance had acquired two years before and filled with splashy art . Vogel says he introduced her to staff on the first floor \u2014 the concierge , the doorman , the front desk attendants \u2014 before suggesting that she might want to see one of the rooms .\nIn Vogel \u2019 s memory , the room was small and mundane , but she made admiring comments before turning to open the door and let herself out when Sondland \u2019 s voice stopped her .\n\u201c I remember seeing my hand drop from the door handle , \u201d she says . \u201c I turned around , and he \u2019 s standing right behind me , and he says , \u2018 Can I just have a hug first ? \u2019 \u201d\nSo she did the only thing she could think of to ensure a safe exit , giving him a hearty-back-pat-we \u2019 re-all-friends-here hug .\n\u201c And as I pulled back , he grabs my face and goes to kiss me . \u201d\nVogel deflected the kiss and brought out a well-practiced line , designed , she says , to preserve his ego : \u201c I said , \u2018 Ooh Gordon , you \u2019 re a married man , and you \u2019 d just break my heart. \u2019 \u201d She left through the hotel lobby , making sure to say goodbye to everyone she \u2019 d been introduced to , so they \u2019 d all remember that she hadn \u2019 t been upstairs for more than a few minutes .\nShortly after , Vogel \u2019 s records show , Sondland emailed her requesting a financial analysis for her business plan . He included a brief aside : \u201c Sorry I was such a dud . \u201d\nAfterward , Vogel confided in a friend , Craig Sweitzer , and her sister , both of whom confirmed her account . \u201c I think she was just exhausted , \u201d Lorrie Vogel says . \u201c All you \u2019 re trying to do is raise funding for something , and you \u2019 re appalled that people would use their power to try and take advantage of you . \u201d\nSondland and Vogel had a second lunch on the calendar for a few weeks later to hammer out details of the investment . Vogel says she decided to keep the appointment , hoping the encounter at the Lucia had been a momentary lapse in judgment .\nVogel and Sondland had offices in the same neighborhood , Portland \u2019 s trendy Pearl District , which is full of warehouses-turned-galleries , shops and many restaurants . Instead of going to lunch there , Vogel recalls Sondland showed up in a vintage convertible and drove them to an out-of-the-way restaurant 8 miles away , across two rivers .\nVogel remembers little of the meal itself , but she recalls the drive back well . She says Sondland placed his hand on her midthigh and left it there for 10 or so minutes . She clamped her own hand on top of his so he couldn \u2019 t move it any farther up her thigh . They spent the rest of the ride in silence .\n\u201c God , I would love to have told him to shove it . To have kneed him in the balls , \u201d she says . \u201c But I didn \u2019 t do that . It was precarious. \u201d She knew that having her fledgling magazine in Sondland \u2019 s hotel rooms , reaching thousands of guests , would boost readership numbers and ad rates .\nThen , just days before she was due to close her first round of financing , Sondland sent an email , changing the terms on his investment .\n\u201c Nicole , \u201d Sondland \u2019 s email began . \u201c After further reflection on this opportunity , I have come to the definite conclusion that this will be a \u2018 labor of love \u2019 investment , at least at the beginning . In checking further , I have determined that the Lucia can not participate under your very creative structure . \u201d\nSondland \u2019 s lawyer disputes that the turnabout was motivated by anything other than business . \u201c A decision not to invest can not fairly be characterized as retaliation , \u201d McDermott wrote . \u201c Ambassador Sondland , in fact , conducted lengthy due diligence about Ms. Vogel \u2019 s investment proposal that included enlisting analyses from other regional publishers , before deciding not to invest . \u201d\nVogel says that Sondland had been planning to put in at least $ 25,000 , her minimum required investment . That money would have allowed Vogel to reach her business plan \u2019 s goal of $ 300,000 . Instead , Sondland said in the email that he would commit to $ 10,000 and would only do so if Vogel raised an extra $ 100,000 .\nVogel says she ended up emptying her own bank account to make up for Sondland \u2019 s reversal , and the magazine went forward without him . Today , she runs magazines in six states .\nIn his letter denying the women \u2019 s accounts , Sondland \u2019 s lawyer wrote :\nAs you are doubtless aware , one of the three complainants , Nicole Vogel , is the owner and publisher of the Portland Monthly . She and her publication stand to benefit directly from publishing these allegations , and Ms. Vogel \u2019 s delay in bringing these forward \u2014 even as Ambassador Sondland was undergoing public scrutiny by Congress as part of his confirmation in 2018 \u2014 casts grave doubt on her credibility . Indeed , we understand that Portland Monthly is under significant financial pressure and Ms. Vogel \u2019 s efforts seem designed to salvage it .\nVogel says the only reason she has shared her story is because \u201c it feels like the right thing to do. \u201d Vogel adds that she \u201c can \u2019 t imagine a scenario where there is a financial benefit to Portland Monthly from this story. \u201d The magazine , which Vogel says has been profitable this year , was long placed in rooms in Sondland \u2019 s hotels in both Portland and Seattle . Vogel says she decided last week to stop placing the magazines there . Halting that arrangement hurts the magazine \u2019 s reach , says the magazine \u2019 s publisher .\nYou should know that Ms. Vogel is a close associate of Rep. Earl Blumenauer who has maligned Ambassador Sondland and threatened his company , misconduct that is now the subject of a Congressional Ethics Office complaint . Congressman Blumenauer is also a vocal critic of the Trump Administration .\nVogel says she has no relationship with the congressman . Blumenauer did occasionally contribute to the magazine , which is cited on one of Vogel \u2019 s pages on the website . The ethics complaint was filed by Provenance in response to Blumenauer calling for a boycott of Sondland \u2019 s company . The congressman did this after Sondland initially declined to testify in the impeachment inquiry . When Sondland did ultimately testify publicly , undercutting the president \u2019 s defense , Blumenauer praised him .\nJana Solis met Sondland in 2008 . Solis , who went by Janice Schnabel at the time , worked as a hospitality safety engineer for New York City-based insurance giant Marsh & McLennan , creating risk management plans and evaluating the safety of restaurants and hotels . The executive also sometimes pitched clients to sign with the company . ( Solis initially misremembered the year she met Sondland as 2003 or 2004 . She reviewed her records after Sondland \u2019 s lawyer noted that Marsh \u2019 s work with Provenance started in 2008 . )\nKnowing that Solis had experience in the hotel industry , a colleague asked her to take a meeting with Sondland , a lunch at Pazzo Ristorante , the Italian mainstay at what was then the Hotel Vintage Plaza .\n\u201c He was flirting through the lunch , and ends up just saying , \u2018 OK , I \u2019 ve heard enough , \u2019 \u201d Solis remembers . \u201c \u2018 You \u2019 re hired . Congratulations . You \u2019 re my new hotel chick . \u2019 \u201d\nThen , on the way out , Solis recalls that Sondland suddenly \u201c slap [ ped ] me on the ass and said , \u2018 I look forward to working with you . \u2019 \u201d\nSondland \u2019 s lawyer wrote that Sondland rejects that account : \u201c Ambassador Sondland denies slapping Ms. Solis on the rear end . \u201d\nNext , Sondland requested she visit his home , so that she could evaluate his personal art collection . Solis wasn \u2019 t trained in art valuations , but she agreed to go to his home , she says , to keep the business account intact . She was tough , she figured , after years spent working in industries like manufacturing .\nThe two toured Sondland \u2019 s home in Portland \u2019 s exclusive West Hills , Solis making notes about the artwork as the hotelier showed off pictures of himself with then-President George W. Bush and Bush \u2019 s dog . And then , she recalls , he told her there was even more of his collection to see in the pool house . She \u2019 d meet him there , she said , excusing herself both to go to the bathroom and map out a potential exit strategy .\n\u201c I get out to the pool house , and he is now naked from the waist down , \u201d Solis remembers . \u201c He said something about , \u2018 I thought we could chat. \u2019 And I said something , trying to keep his ego intact \u2014 not that he needed that , not that it wouldn \u2019 t have been anyway \u2014 I said something like , \u2018 I can \u2019 t have that conversation . \u2019 \u201d\nSolis remembers apologizing , saying she was sorry if she \u2019 d given Sondland the wrong impression . She wanted to preserve the business relationship and not jeopardize her senior position at a job she loved . Also , he was her ride home : \u201c I thought , \u2018 I need to keep myself intact and get out , \u2019 \u201d she recalls . \u201c So that \u2019 s what you do , apologize . \u201d\n\u201c So he \u2019 s like , \u2018 Well , I just thought we could have some fun , but you know , it \u2019 s cool . \u2019 \u201d\nSondland put his pants back on . Then he drove her back to downtown Portland , but not before , in Solis \u2019 memory , he made one more request : \u201c Can I have a hug ? \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t Solis \u2019 last encounter with Sondland . A few months later , she was tasked with inspecting and holding staff training sessions at his hotel properties , including the Roosevelt Hotel in Seattle ( now renamed the Hotel Theodore ) , where Sondland keeps a penthouse apartment .\n\u201c And the last day I was there doing the training , he said , \u2018 I need you to see the penthouse as well. \u2019 \u201d She didn \u2019 t know it was his private living quarters .\n\u201c So I \u2019 m acting very professional , and I \u2019 m going over some of the things I think he needs to deal with [ as part of my inspection ] and just trying to stay down that road . [ He says : ] \u2018 Have a drink . Thanks for all you \u2019 ve done this week . \u2019 \u201d\nSolis remembers sitting on the couch with him , having a glass of wine and hoping as hard as she could \u2014 praying \u2014 that it would go no further .\n\u201c The next thing I know , he \u2019 s all over me , \u201d she recalls . \u201c He \u2019 s on top of me . He \u2019 s kissing me , shoving his tongue down my throat . And I \u2019 m trying to wiggle out from under him , and the next thing you know , I \u2019 m sort of rising up to get away from him , and I fall over the back of the couch . \u201d\nShe remembers suddenly finding herself on the floor . \u201c And I \u2019 m like : \u2018 Gordon , I \u2019 m not sure what else to say . You know , I really , really want to do business with you , but I \u2019 m not sure we can . I don \u2019 t know what your issues are , but I am telling you , I can not make them mine . \u2019 \u201d\nSondland \u2019 s lawyer says the ambassador denies that happened . \u201c Ambassador Sondland also denies exposing himself to her or forcibly kissing her , \u201d he wrote . \u201c We have been able to review Provenance \u2019 s records interacting with Ms. Solis \u2019 s company , and at no time did she or her employer convey any concern about Ambassador Sondland , his comportment , or the nature of any business dealings he had with them or their personnel . \u201d\nSolis \u2019 former husband , Kevin Schnabel , recalls Solis was upset when she arrived home from that trip . \u201c One of the things that always stuck in my head is her comment that he literally had his tongue down [ her ] throat , [ and as she was ] trying to get away from him she had fallen over the back of the couch , \u201d Schnabel remembers . Solis also told Schnabel her recollection of what happened in the pool house .\nA few days later , Solis was back in her office , working late , when the phone rang . She recalls Sondland was on the other end , screaming at her over insurance issues tangential to her job . \u201c At the end of the day , it wasn \u2019 t about insurance . He was pissed . He didn \u2019 t get his way [ with me ] , and he was making it about work , \u201d she says . \u201c And he was making it all my fault . \u201d\nAlone at her desk , Solis started to sob . She says a colleague found her there ; he \u2019 d heard Sondland \u2019 s screams on the speakerphone from his office . The colleague , who declined to be named , says he saw the incident . She \u201c became emotional , \u201d he says , \u201c and concerned about what Marsh would think if [ she ] lost the account over the matter . \u201d\nIt was the last time Solis ever spoke with Sondland . Solis left the account . Provenance is currently a client of Marsh . Today , she still works in the insurance industry and often travels the country as a speaker and leader in her industry .\nSondland \u2019 s lawyer provided an email that one of Solis \u2019 colleagues at her current firm sent to Provenance in 2016 pitching them on business . The colleague wrote that he had been referred by Solis .\nSolis says she didn \u2019 t know about the email . \u201c You didn \u2019 t see me on the signature block , nor did you see me copied on it , \u201d she says . \u201c I certainly wouldn \u2019 t have directed him to Provenance and , at a minimum , certainly would not have said \u2018 use my name when you \u2019 re talking to Gordon. \u2019 That \u2019 s a complete recipe for disaster . \u201d\nThe third woman who says she faced sexual misconduct by Sondland is Natalie Sept . In 2008 , Sept moved home to Portland after a post-college job teaching in the Chicago suburbs . Sept had always been interested in politics and eventually connected with Portland City Council member Nick Fish , who was running for reelection and needed a fundraiser . He hired Sept , whose role eventually expanded to campaign manager .\nAfter Fish won his 2010 election in a landslide , Sept had breakfast with him at the restaurant of the Heathman Hotel ( Provenance would add the hotel to its portfolio in 2017 ) , a frequent watering hole for Portland \u2019 s political class . Sondland , who had donated to Fish , was at a nearby table .\nSept remembers that her boss introduced her to Sondland and said : \u201c \u2018 This is Natalie . She \u2019 s a rising star. \u2019 \u201d Intrigued , Sondland invited her to another breakfast , this time at Gracie \u2019 s , the cavernous dining room at the Hotel deLuxe ( Provenance bought the century-old hotel in 2004 ) .\n\u201c So I \u2019 m talking to him about sports and downtown economic development , and he \u2019 s telling me about the Oregon governor \u2019 s film board doing a tour in LA , promising me huge opportunities , and the chance to work with the governor , \u201d Sept recalls . In addition to being a major benefactor of the art museum , Sondland was the chair of the film board .\n\u201c I was so starry-eyed about all of these institutions and people and power associated with these kinds of opportunities , \u201d Sept says . \u201c I was convinced it was something he could help me attain . \u201d\nSoon after , Sept learned her path crisscrossed with Sondland \u2019 s in familial ways : Sondland had hired her uncle to paint his house , and her stepfather served with Sondland \u2019 s wife on the Oregon Investment Council . \u201c I started to feel really comfortable , \u201d Sept remembers . \u201c We had all these points of connection . I thought , \u2018 I can trust this person . \u2019 \u201d\nSondland invited Sept to dinner at El Gaucho , the same spot he took Vogel , to discuss a potential job at the film office . Sept showed up in a business suit , ready to network . When she arrived , she found that Sondland had ordered them what she recalls as \u201c the nicest bottle of wine \u201d on the menu .\nSondland spent much of the meal , Sept remembers , talking about his family and showing her pictures of his kids at the White House with then-President Bush . ( The former president had appointed Sondland to the Commission on White House Fellowships . ) It wasn \u2019 t until the tail end of the meal that the film office job finally came up . So Sept agreed to continue the conversation down the street at Saucebox , a cocktail bar .\n\u201c When I come back , he is sitting on the booth side of this big table , \u201d she recalls . \u201c He says , \u2018 Come sit next to me. \u2019 And I thought , \u2018 Oh my god , this isn \u2019 t good. \u2019 So I said , \u2018 Oh , I forgot , I have to go home . \u2019 \u201d\nSept says she apologized for cutting the evening short . Sondland paid the tab and then offered to walk her to her car . \u201c He keeps insisting , and I \u2019 m nervous and afraid and I don \u2019 t want to make a scene , so I say , \u2018 OK , fine , \u2019 \u201d Sept says .\nAt her car , Sept says , Sondland leaned in for a hug .\n\u201c So I give him a quick hug and he holds onto my shoulders and looks at me and pushes himself into me and tries to kiss me . \u201d\nSept says she pushed him to the side , got into her car and sped off . The next day , trying to be the conscientious professional , she sent a follow-up email scheduling Sondland for a meeting with Fish .\n\u201c What was most important was that I maintain professionalism . I didn \u2019 t want him to think I was frazzled by this , \u201d she says .\nIn response to Sept \u2019 s account , Sondland \u2019 s lawyer wrote : \u201c Ambassador Sondland did discuss Ms. Sept \u2019 s job prospects with her , but he denies any unwanted touching . He specifically denies attempting to kiss her , along with her claim that she pushed him away . \u201d\nSoon after Sept \u2019 s encounter , she told a friend in local government about the incident . \u201c She was shaken up , \u201d says the friend , who declined to be identified . \u201c That sort of behavior is shocking and should be shocking , and that \u2019 s how she reacted . \u201d\nSept never heard from Sondland again about the state film commission job . She went on to work for prominent Democratic politicians , including on Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign in 2016 .\nIn his statement , Sondland said he has never been aware of any accusations of unwanted touching or kissing against him . \u201c There has never been mention of them in any form during the period of the allegations , \u201d he wrote , \u201c although such a complaint could easily have been aired through multiple channels . These false incidents are at odds with my character . \u201d\nSondland might have remained a Northwest power player , if not for his focus on becoming an ambassador , reportedly a lifetime goal .\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign , Sondland had pulled away from Trump , removing his name as one of the hosts of a Seattle fundraiser after Trump ridiculed the Muslim family of a slain U.S. soldier . He initially supported Jeb Bush \u2019 s presidential campaign . But when Trump was elected , Sondland donated $ 1 million to his inaugural committee .\nPresident Donald Trump and Sondland in Brussels on July 10 , 2018 . ( Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo )\nSondland \u2019 s dream of being an envoy was realized when Trump nominated him to be ambassador to the European Union in May 2018 , the latest in a line of political donors named to the position .\nSondland has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in election campaign donations to mostly Republican candidates and causes . But he \u2019 s also donated to various Democrats , including Sen. Ron Wyden , D-Ore .\nWyden spoke in support of Sondland during his confirmation hearings . The senator said he \u2019 s known \u201c Gordy \u201d for more than 25 years and said he expected that Sondland would represent \u201c the Oregon way , \u201d which Wyden described as \u201c caring about people , having a good heart . \u201d\nThis fall , Vogel was driving to work , listening to NPR , when she heard \u201c Morning Edition \u201d co-host Rachel Martin detailing Sondland \u2019 s involvement in the impeachment inquiry .\n\u201c Was there a quid pro quo ? \u201d Martin asked . \u201c And did Sondland make it happen ? \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m somebody who has sort of laughed it off and rolled my eyes and said , \u2018 What a jerk , \u2019 all these years , and suddenly I \u2019 m crying in my car ? \u201d she says . \u201c What the hell ? That doesn \u2019 t sound like me. \u201d She recalls thinking at that moment about the transactional nature of Sondland \u2019 s Ukraine mission and saw it as a painful reminder of her own experience .\n\u201c The fact that [ Sondland ] uses his power to terrorize people who he perceives as having less power is really disgusting , \u201d Sept says . \u201c I want other women to feel comfortable to share their stories , and be believed . \u201d\n\u201c I would hate to see anybody else go through it . This runs so far beyond just a little groping . It affects how I do business . And who I can do business with , \u201d says Solis . So if talking \u201c is the right thing to do , then that \u2019 s what I \u2019 m going to do . \u201d\nShe wants her children to know that what their `` mom did was right , that I had a sense of self and a strong character . And I want my character to be revealed to people in a positive way and in a way that is courageous to the degree that I can be . \u201d",

After she made her lack of interest clear, she says Sondland called her, screaming about her job performance.\n\nA third woman, 27 years Sondland\u2019s junior, met him to discuss a potential job. She says he pushed himself against her and kissed her. She shoved him away. She says his job help stopped.\n\nAll three women have agreed to be named in this story. In all the cases, friends, family members or colleagues of the women recall being told about the encounters at the time. The cases span a seven-year period, ending less than a decade ago. Sondland denies the allegations.\n\n\u201cIn decades of my career in business and civic affairs, my conduct can be affirmed by hundreds of employees and colleagues with whom I have worked in countless circumstances,\u201d Sondland said in a statement. \u201cThese untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and, I believe, coordinated for political purposes. They have no basis in fact, and I categorically deny them.\u201d (Read his statement.)\n\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer added in a letter: \u201cNotably, what each of these three women share in common is that they pursued Ambassador Sondland for financial and personal gain \u2014 an investment, a job, and insurance brokerage work \u2014 and he declined their proposals.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer, Jim McDermott, also wrote that the three women are trying to undermine Sondland\u2019s latest testimony. \u201cGiven the timing of your intended story, a reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that you are attempting to affect Ambassador Sondland\u2019s credibility as a fact witness in the pending impeachment inquiry,\u201d McDermott wrote. \u201cGiven the politically charged climate in which current events are unfolding, some might consider this to be veiled witness tampering.\u201d\n\nReporting on this story began in October, around the time of Sondland\u2019s initial impeachment testimony, in which he backed the president\u2019s assertion that there was no quid pro quo involving Ukraine.\n\nThe day after Sondland gave that testimony, Nicole Vogel spoke at the Day of the Girl Luncheon in Seattle, an event hosted by a regional nonprofit, Girls Inc., whose mission is to inspire \u201call girls to be strong, smart, and bold.\u201d Vogel decided to recount her Sondland story and name him.\n\nVogel also mentioned it to an editor at Portland Monthly, the co-publisher of this story, and she later spoke about it again at a breakfast event in Portland.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Vogel is the owner of Portland Monthly. Vogel cooperated with the story as a source. She was not involved in editorial decisions. The magazine\u2019s editorial team decided to partner with ProPublica to independently report her story.]\n\nHear the Women Tell Their Stories\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of indecent proposals when I was raising capital, but none as brazen as his,\u201d Vogel recalls. She encountered Sondland 16 years ago when she was trying to raise money to start her magazine. \u201cI have nothing to say about what he did or didn\u2019t do [involving Ukraine]. But if people are asking what his moral character is, I have one more piece of evidence for them.\u201d\n\nThe women had kept their stories to their own circles, even after Sondland was nominated and vetted for an ambassadorship by a president who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women. The women say they were not contacted by the government for any background checks.\n\nIn 2003, Vogel had an idea to start a magazine with her journalist brother that would chronicle Portland\u2019s exploding art, culture and food scenes. She was 34 years old and fresh off a job at Move.com. Armed with full mock-ups of the magazine and detailed financial projections, the search for investors led her to Sondland.\n\nSondland has long been a power player in Portland, where he is one of the region\u2019s most prominent business figures. He owns five hotels in Portland under the umbrella of the company he founded, Provenance Hotel Group. He was once asked at a panel why he got into the business. \u201cIt combines all the elements that give me a reason to get up in the morning,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cYou have food, you have wine, you have design, you have art, you have intrigue, you have sex. You have everything you can think of.\u201d\n\nProtesters rallying outside a Portland, Oregon, hotel managed by the company Sondland founded, Provenance Hotel Group, on Oct. 13. (Alex Milan Tracy/Sipa via AP Images)\n\nSondland is also a prominent philanthropist. He has served on several high-profile nonprofit boards, including as the chairman of the board of trustees of the Portland Art Museum. A prominent staircase there bears his name and that of his wife, Katherine Durant.\n\nAccording to Vogel, Sondland was helpful, connecting her with potential advertisers and investors. Then, in the spring of 2003, he invited her to dinner at El Gaucho, a clubby, old-school steakhouse, requesting information on the business\u2019s projected financials. Over dinner, he told her that he would invest his own money in the magazine, and that Portland needed people like her.\n\n\u201cGordon had said that night that he was going to invest,\u201d Vogel recalls. \u201cAnd in fact, he said to me that he was interested in investing in the company, but that he was more interested in investing in me, because he felt as if Portland didn\u2019t keep people of high ambition and talent.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, Vogel remembers Sondland proposing a walk across the street to Hotel Lucia, which Provenance had acquired two years before and filled with splashy art. Vogel says he introduced her to staff on the first floor \u2014 the concierge, the doorman, the front desk attendants \u2014 before suggesting that she might want to see one of the rooms.\n\nIn Vogel\u2019s memory, the room was small and mundane, but she made admiring comments before turning to open the door and let herself out when Sondland\u2019s voice stopped her.\n\n\u201cI remember seeing my hand drop from the door handle,\u201d she says. \u201cI turned around, and he\u2019s standing right behind me, and he says, \u2018Can I just have a hug first?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo she did the only thing she could think of to ensure a safe exit, giving him a hearty-back-pat-we\u2019re-all-friends-here hug.\n\n\u201cAnd as I pulled back, he grabs my face and goes to kiss me.\u201d\n\nVogel deflected the kiss and brought out a well-practiced line, designed, she says, to preserve his ego: \u201cI said, \u2018Ooh Gordon, you\u2019re a married man, and you\u2019d just break my heart.\u2019\u201d She left through the hotel lobby, making sure to say goodbye to everyone she\u2019d been introduced to, so they\u2019d all remember that she hadn\u2019t been upstairs for more than a few minutes.\n\nShortly after, Vogel\u2019s records show, Sondland emailed her requesting a financial analysis for her business plan. He included a brief aside: \u201cSorry I was such a dud.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Vogel confided in a friend, Craig Sweitzer, and her sister, both of whom confirmed her account. \u201cI think she was just exhausted,\u201d Lorrie Vogel says. \u201cAll you\u2019re trying to do is raise funding for something, and you\u2019re appalled that people would use their power to try and take advantage of you.\u201d\n\nSondland and Vogel had a second lunch on the calendar for a few weeks later to hammer out details of the investment. Vogel says she decided to keep the appointment, hoping the encounter at the Lucia had been a momentary lapse in judgment.\n\nVogel and Sondland had offices in the same neighborhood, Portland\u2019s trendy Pearl District, which is full of warehouses-turned-galleries, shops and many restaurants. Instead of going to lunch there, Vogel recalls Sondland showed up in a vintage convertible and drove them to an out-of-the-way restaurant 8 miles away, across two rivers.\n\nVogel remembers little of the meal itself, but she recalls the drive back well. She says Sondland placed his hand on her midthigh and left it there for 10 or so minutes. She clamped her own hand on top of his so he couldn\u2019t move it any farther up her thigh. They spent the rest of the ride in silence.\n\n\u201cGod, I would love to have told him to shove it. To have kneed him in the balls,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do that. It was precarious.\u201d She knew that having her fledgling magazine in Sondland\u2019s hotel rooms, reaching thousands of guests, would boost readership numbers and ad rates.\n\nThen, just days before she was due to close her first round of financing, Sondland sent an email, changing the terms on his investment.\n\n\u201cNicole,\u201d Sondland\u2019s email began. \u201cAfter further reflection on this opportunity, I have come to the definite conclusion that this will be a \u2018labor of love\u2019 investment, at least at the beginning. In checking further, I have determined that the Lucia cannot participate under your very creative structure.\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer disputes that the turnabout was motivated by anything other than business. \u201cA decision not to invest cannot fairly be characterized as retaliation,\u201d McDermott wrote. \u201cAmbassador Sondland, in fact, conducted lengthy due diligence about Ms. Vogel\u2019s investment proposal that included enlisting analyses from other regional publishers, before deciding not to invest.\u201d\n\nVogel says that Sondland had been planning to put in at least $25,000, her minimum required investment. That money would have allowed Vogel to reach her business plan\u2019s goal of $300,000. Instead, Sondland said in the email that he would commit to $10,000 and would only do so if Vogel raised an extra $100,000.\n\nVogel says she ended up emptying her own bank account to make up for Sondland\u2019s reversal, and the magazine went forward without him. Today, she runs magazines in six states.\n\nIn his letter denying the women\u2019s accounts, Sondland\u2019s lawyer wrote:\n\nAs you are doubtless aware, one of the three complainants, Nicole Vogel, is the owner and publisher of the Portland Monthly. She and her publication stand to benefit directly from publishing these allegations, and Ms. Vogel\u2019s delay in bringing these forward \u2014 even as Ambassador Sondland was undergoing public scrutiny by Congress as part of his confirmation in 2018 \u2014 casts grave doubt on her credibility. Indeed, we understand that Portland Monthly is under significant financial pressure and Ms. Vogel\u2019s efforts seem designed to salvage it.\n\nVogel says the only reason she has shared her story is because \u201cit feels like the right thing to do.\u201d Vogel adds that she \u201ccan\u2019t imagine a scenario where there is a financial benefit to Portland Monthly from this story.\u201d The magazine, which Vogel says has been profitable this year, was long placed in rooms in Sondland\u2019s hotels in both Portland and Seattle. Vogel says she decided last week to stop placing the magazines there. Halting that arrangement hurts the magazine\u2019s reach, says the magazine\u2019s publisher.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney also wrote:\n\nYou should know that Ms. Vogel is a close associate of Rep. Earl Blumenauer who has maligned Ambassador Sondland and threatened his company, misconduct that is now the subject of a Congressional Ethics Office complaint. Congressman Blumenauer is also a vocal critic of the Trump Administration.\n\nVogel says she has no relationship with the congressman. Blumenauer did occasionally contribute to the magazine, which is cited on one of Vogel\u2019s pages on the website. The ethics complaint was filed by Provenance in response to Blumenauer calling for a boycott of Sondland\u2019s company. The congressman did this after Sondland initially declined to testify in the impeachment inquiry. When Sondland did ultimately testify publicly, undercutting the president\u2019s defense, Blumenauer praised him.\n\nJana Solis met Sondland in 2008. Solis, who went by Janice Schnabel at the time, worked as a hospitality safety engineer for New York City-based insurance giant Marsh & McLennan, creating risk management plans and evaluating the safety of restaurants and hotels. The executive also sometimes pitched clients to sign with the company. (Solis initially misremembered the year she met Sondland as 2003 or 2004. She reviewed her records after Sondland\u2019s lawyer noted that Marsh\u2019s work with Provenance started in 2008.)\n\nKnowing that Solis had experience in the hotel industry, a colleague asked her to take a meeting with Sondland, a lunch at Pazzo Ristorante, the Italian mainstay at what was then the Hotel Vintage Plaza.\n\n\u201cHe was flirting through the lunch, and ends up just saying, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve heard enough,\u2019\u201d Solis remembers. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re hired. Congratulations. You\u2019re my new hotel chick.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen, on the way out, Solis recalls that Sondland suddenly \u201cslap[ped] me on the ass and said, \u2018I look forward to working with you.\u2019\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer wrote that Sondland rejects that account: \u201cAmbassador Sondland denies slapping Ms. Solis on the rear end.\u201d\n\nNext, Sondland requested she visit his home, so that she could evaluate his personal art collection. Solis wasn\u2019t trained in art valuations, but she agreed to go to his home, she says, to keep the business account intact. She was tough, she figured, after years spent working in industries like manufacturing.\n\nThe two toured Sondland\u2019s home in Portland\u2019s exclusive West Hills, Solis making notes about the artwork as the hotelier showed off pictures of himself with then-President George W. Bush and Bush\u2019s dog. And then, she recalls, he told her there was even more of his collection to see in the pool house. She\u2019d meet him there, she said, excusing herself both to go to the bathroom and map out a potential exit strategy.\n\n\u201cI get out to the pool house, and he is now naked from the waist down,\u201d Solis remembers. \u201cHe said something about, \u2018I thought we could chat.\u2019 And I said something, trying to keep his ego intact \u2014 not that he needed that, not that it wouldn\u2019t have been anyway \u2014 I said something like, \u2018I can\u2019t have that conversation.\u2019\u201d\n\nSolis remembers apologizing, saying she was sorry if she\u2019d given Sondland the wrong impression. She wanted to preserve the business relationship and not jeopardize her senior position at a job she loved. Also, he was her ride home: \u201cI thought, \u2018I need to keep myself intact and get out,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you do, apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he\u2019s like, \u2018Well, I just thought we could have some fun, but you know, it\u2019s cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nSondland put his pants back on. Then he drove her back to downtown Portland, but not before, in Solis\u2019 memory, he made one more request: \u201cCan I have a hug?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Solis\u2019 last encounter with Sondland. A few months later, she was tasked with inspecting and holding staff training sessions at his hotel properties, including the Roosevelt Hotel in Seattle (now renamed the Hotel Theodore), where Sondland keeps a penthouse apartment.\n\n\u201cAnd the last day I was there doing the training, he said, \u2018I need you to see the penthouse as well.\u2019\u201d She didn\u2019t know it was his private living quarters.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m acting very professional, and I\u2019m going over some of the things I think he needs to deal with [as part of my inspection] and just trying to stay down that road. [He says:] \u2018Have a drink. Thanks for all you\u2019ve done this week.\u2019\u201d\n\nSolis remembers sitting on the couch with him, having a glass of wine and hoping as hard as she could \u2014 praying \u2014 that it would go no further.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I know, he\u2019s all over me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s on top of me. He\u2019s kissing me, shoving his tongue down my throat. And I\u2019m trying to wiggle out from under him, and the next thing you know, I\u2019m sort of rising up to get away from him, and I fall over the back of the couch.\u201d\n\nShe remembers suddenly finding herself on the floor. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like: \u2018Gordon, I\u2019m not sure what else to say. You know, I really, really want to do business with you, but I\u2019m not sure we can. I don\u2019t know what your issues are, but I am telling you, I cannot make them mine.\u2019\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer says the ambassador denies that happened. \u201cAmbassador Sondland also denies exposing himself to her or forcibly kissing her,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have been able to review Provenance\u2019s records interacting with Ms. Solis\u2019s company, and at no time did she or her employer convey any concern about Ambassador Sondland, his comportment, or the nature of any business dealings he had with them or their personnel.\u201d\n\nSolis\u2019 former husband, Kevin Schnabel, recalls Solis was upset when she arrived home from that trip. \u201cOne of the things that always stuck in my head is her comment that he literally had his tongue down [her] throat, [and as she was] trying to get away from him she had fallen over the back of the couch,\u201d Schnabel remembers. Solis also told Schnabel her recollection of what happened in the pool house.\n\nA few days later, Solis was back in her office, working late, when the phone rang. She recalls Sondland was on the other end, screaming at her over insurance issues tangential to her job. \u201cAt the end of the day, it wasn\u2019t about insurance. He was pissed. He didn\u2019t get his way [with me], and he was making it about work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd he was making it all my fault.\u201d\n\nSondland at the Longworth House Office Building in Washington, D.C. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nAlone at her desk, Solis started to sob. She says a colleague found her there; he\u2019d heard Sondland\u2019s screams on the speakerphone from his office. The colleague, who declined to be named, says he saw the incident. She \u201cbecame emotional,\u201d he says, \u201cand concerned about what Marsh would think if [she] lost the account over the matter.\u201d\n\nIt was the last time Solis ever spoke with Sondland. Solis left the account. Provenance is currently a client of Marsh. Today, she still works in the insurance industry and often travels the country as a speaker and leader in her industry.\n\nSondland\u2019s lawyer provided an email that one of Solis\u2019 colleagues at her current firm sent to Provenance in 2016 pitching them on business. The colleague wrote that he had been referred by Solis.\n\nSolis says she didn\u2019t know about the email. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see me on the signature block, nor did you see me copied on it,\u201d she says. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t have directed him to Provenance and, at a minimum, certainly would not have said \u2018use my name when you\u2019re talking to Gordon.\u2019 That\u2019s a complete recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nThe third woman who says she faced sexual misconduct by Sondland is Natalie Sept. In 2008, Sept moved home to Portland after a post-college job teaching in the Chicago suburbs. Sept had always been interested in politics and eventually connected with Portland City Council member Nick Fish, who was running for reelection and needed a fundraiser. He hired Sept, whose role eventually expanded to campaign manager.\n\nAfter Fish won his 2010 election in a landslide, Sept had breakfast with him at the restaurant of the Heathman Hotel (Provenance would add the hotel to its portfolio in 2017), a frequent watering hole for Portland\u2019s political class. Sondland, who had donated to Fish, was at a nearby table.\n\nSept remembers that her boss introduced her to Sondland and said: \u201c\u2018This is Natalie. She\u2019s a rising star.\u2019\u201d Intrigued, Sondland invited her to another breakfast, this time at Gracie\u2019s, the cavernous dining room at the Hotel deLuxe (Provenance bought the century-old hotel in 2004).\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m talking to him about sports and downtown economic development, and he\u2019s telling me about the Oregon governor\u2019s film board doing a tour in LA, promising me huge opportunities, and the chance to work with the governor,\u201d Sept recalls. In addition to being a major benefactor of the art museum, Sondland was the chair of the film board.\n\n\u201cI was so starry-eyed about all of these institutions and people and power associated with these kinds of opportunities,\u201d Sept says. \u201cI was convinced it was something he could help me attain.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Sept learned her path crisscrossed with Sondland\u2019s in familial ways: Sondland had hired her uncle to paint his house, and her stepfather served with Sondland\u2019s wife on the Oregon Investment Council. \u201cI started to feel really comfortable,\u201d Sept remembers. \u201cWe had all these points of connection. I thought, \u2018I can trust this person.\u2019\u201d\n\nSondland invited Sept to dinner at El Gaucho, the same spot he took Vogel, to discuss a potential job at the film office. Sept showed up in a business suit, ready to network. When she arrived, she found that Sondland had ordered them what she recalls as \u201cthe nicest bottle of wine\u201d on the menu.\n\nSondland spent much of the meal, Sept remembers, talking about his family and showing her pictures of his kids at the White House with then-President Bush. (The former president had appointed Sondland to the Commission on White House Fellowships.) It wasn\u2019t until the tail end of the meal that the film office job finally came up. So Sept agreed to continue the conversation down the street at Saucebox, a cocktail bar.\n\nSept says she immediately headed for the bar\u2019s bathroom.\n\n\u201cWhen I come back, he is sitting on the booth side of this big table,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe says, \u2018Come sit next to me.\u2019 And I thought, \u2018Oh my god, this isn\u2019t good.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Oh, I forgot, I have to go home.\u2019\u201d\n\nSept says she apologized for cutting the evening short. Sondland paid the tab and then offered to walk her to her car. \u201cHe keeps insisting, and I\u2019m nervous and afraid and I don\u2019t want to make a scene, so I say, \u2018OK, fine,\u2019\u201d Sept says.\n\nAt her car, Sept says, Sondland leaned in for a hug.\n\n\u201cSo I give him a quick hug and he holds onto my shoulders and looks at me and pushes himself into me and tries to kiss me.\u201d\n\nGordon Sondland testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 20. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nSept says she pushed him to the side, got into her car and sped off. The next day, trying to be the conscientious professional, she sent a follow-up email scheduling Sondland for a meeting with Fish.\n\n\u201cWhat was most important was that I maintain professionalism. I didn\u2019t want him to think I was frazzled by this,\u201d she says.\n\nIn response to Sept\u2019s account, Sondland\u2019s lawyer wrote: \u201cAmbassador Sondland did discuss Ms. Sept\u2019s job prospects with her, but he denies any unwanted touching. He specifically denies attempting to kiss her, along with her claim that she pushed him away.\u201d\n\nSoon after Sept\u2019s encounter, she told a friend in local government about the incident. \u201cShe was shaken up,\u201d says the friend, who declined to be identified. \u201cThat sort of behavior is shocking and should be shocking, and that\u2019s how she reacted.\u201d\n\nSept never heard from Sondland again about the state film commission job. She went on to work for prominent Democratic politicians, including on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nIn his statement, Sondland said he has never been aware of any accusations of unwanted touching or kissing against him. \u201cThere has never been mention of them in any form during the period of the allegations,\u201d he wrote, \u201calthough such a complaint could easily have been aired through multiple channels. These false incidents are at odds with my character.\u201d\n\nSondland might have remained a Northwest power player, if not for his focus on becoming an ambassador, reportedly a lifetime goal.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Sondland had pulled away from Trump, removing his name as one of the hosts of a Seattle fundraiser after Trump ridiculed the Muslim family of a slain U.S. soldier. He initially supported Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign. But when Trump was elected, Sondland donated $1 million to his inaugural committee.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Sondland in Brussels on July 10, 2018. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo)\n\nSondland\u2019s dream of being an envoy was realized when Trump nominated him to be ambassador to the European Union in May 2018, the latest in a line of political donors named to the position.\n\nSondland has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in election campaign donations to mostly Republican candidates and causes. But he\u2019s also donated to various Democrats, including Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.\n\nWyden spoke in support of Sondland during his confirmation hearings. The senator said he\u2019s known \u201cGordy\u201d for more than 25 years and said he expected that Sondland would represent \u201cthe Oregon way,\u201d which Wyden described as \u201ccaring about people, having a good heart.\u201d\n\nThe Senate approved Sondland\u2019s nomination by a voice vote.\n\nThis fall, Vogel was driving to work, listening to NPR, when she heard \u201cMorning Edition\u201d co-host Rachel Martin detailing Sondland\u2019s involvement in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cWas there a quid pro quo?\u201d Martin asked. \u201cAnd did Sondland make it happen?\u201d\n\nVogel started to cry in her car.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m somebody who has sort of laughed it off and rolled my eyes and said, \u2018What a jerk,\u2019 all these years, and suddenly I\u2019m crying in my car?\u201d she says. \u201cWhat the hell? That doesn\u2019t sound like me.\u201d She recalls thinking at that moment about the transactional nature of Sondland\u2019s Ukraine mission and saw it as a painful reminder of her own experience.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [Sondland] uses his power to terrorize people who he perceives as having less power is really disgusting,\u201d Sept says. \u201cI want other women to feel comfortable to share their stories, and be believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hate to see anybody else go through it. This runs so far beyond just a little groping. It affects how I do business. And who I can do business with,\u201d says Solis. So if talking \u201cis the right thing to do, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nShe wants her children to know that what their \"mom did was right, that I had a sense of self and a strong character. And I want my character to be revealed to people in a positive way and in a way that is courageous to the degree that I can be.\u201d",
