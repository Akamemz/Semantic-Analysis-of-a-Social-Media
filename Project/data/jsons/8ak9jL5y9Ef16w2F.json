Keith Alexander , NSA director .\nSpeaking before a capacity crowd of hackers and security experts Wednesday at the Black Hat computer-security conference , Alexander defended the NSA 's embattled programs , which collect phone metadata and online communications in an effort to root out potential terrorists . The secret programs have come under fire since their existence was revealed in June by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden , who leaked details about them to several newspapers .\n`` I promise you the truth -- what we know , what we 're doing , and what I can not tell you because we do n't want to jeopardize our future defense , '' Alexander told the audience , which included a few hecklers who shouted profanities and accused him of lying .\nHe then gave a partial recap , using PowerPoint slides , of how the two intelligence programs work .
