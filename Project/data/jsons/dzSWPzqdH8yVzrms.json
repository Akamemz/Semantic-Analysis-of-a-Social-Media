    "content": "Donald Trump used a press conference about millions of dollars in donations he says he raised for veterans \u2019 groups to hijack the cable news discussion and largely avoid coverage of an anticipated document release today as part of a lawsuit alleging misrepresentation by his now-defunct Trump University business . CNN , MSNBC , and Fox News devoted more than five hours to previewing , airing , and discussing Trump \u2019 s press conference between 6 am and 4 pm , compared to less than one hour of discussion of the Trump University lawsuit .\nAfter intense and admirable pressure from the press , Trump last week finally took steps toward personally donating $ 1 million to a veterans \u2019 charity , four months after he falsely claimed he had done so . Trump had organized a January 28 nationally televised fundraiser as a substitute for appearing at a debate moderated by Fox News , which Trump was feuding with at the time . That night , he claimed to have raised $ 6 million , including his own gift . He subsequently avoided repeated questions about where the donations had gone .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign originally scheduled a press conference for May 30 to discuss the donations . But on May 29 , he moved the appearance to today .\nIt \u2019 s not hard to see why . On May 27 , a federal judge ordered the release this week of internal documents from Trump University , a Trump-owned real estate seminar business that is facing several pending fraud and misrepresentation lawsuits brought by former students and by the state of New York .
