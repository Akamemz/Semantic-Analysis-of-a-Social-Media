It \u2019 s not an issue of urgency , it can be passed next year . A better immigration bill can be passed by a Republican House and a Republican Senate , perhaps next year . You have no leverage in this debate if you go to conference with this bill that passed the Democratic Senate \u2026 The Republican establishment , the Republican consultant class in Washington , and big business really want immigration reform , and they may try to jam it down the throats of actual Republican grassroots this year , and I think it \u2019 s the one thing that could actually cost Republicans the Senate [ in 2014 ] . Scarborough : I want to double down on that one \u2026 The Washington Establishment , the New York Establishment , they all suggest that passing immigration reform is going to help Republicans with Hispanic voters this year . I can \u2019 t think of a single thing they could pass that could hurt them more in the midterm election than passing an immigration bill framed by Barack Obama and Harry Reid and a weakened Republican House .\nKudos to Scarborough for popping his head out of the bubble that at this same time last year had him screaming for months that the GOP would be doomed if they didn \u2019 t cave to Barack Obama and the media on gun control .\nThe fact is this : No one cares about immigration , and by \u201c no one \u201d I mean 98 % of the American people . They are worried about jobs and ObamaCare .\nMoreover , while the well-honed media myth is that George W. Bush saw his second-term approval ratings plunge into the twenties because of his handling of Hurricane Katrina and Iraq , the truth is that what really buried Bush was losing his base due to his push for comprehensive immigration reform .\nThere are plenty of conservatives like myself who believe that our immigration system is a mess and that a path to legalization for the millions of illegals already here is the right thing to do . But that doesn \u2019 t mean we can be emotionally blackmailed into believing that the House entering into a conference committee involving the abomination that is the Shumer-Rubio Senate immigration bill is anything close to sanity .\nThose of us sympathetic to immigration reform must first be reassured beyond any doubt that the border will be secured as a way to ensure this never happens again . In that respect , the Shumer-Rubio bill is an unqualified failure \u2013 nothing more than a bloated , crony-capitalized ObamaBorderCare .\nRubio got rolled by Shumer and Senate Democrats , and politically it cost him plenty with his base . The same will happen to the GOP as a whole if they go near this issue this year .\nIf the GOP is eager to tell the base that going out to vote in 2014 is a big waste of time , nothing will send up a bigger flare announcing just that than caving to Chuck Shumer , Harry Reid , and Barack Obama on anything , much less immigration .\nIf the GOP wants to win the Hispanic vote , start with jobs , school choice , and putting an end to late-term abortion .",
