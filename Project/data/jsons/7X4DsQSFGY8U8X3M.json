    "content": "Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night . Second-place finisher Pete Buttigieg earned 24.4 percent of the vote , while Amy Klobuchar , not long ago polling in single digits , came out of nowhere with 19.8 percent , a classic New Hampshire outlier result .\nThe words \u201c eked \u201d and \u201c narrowly \u201d are getting a workout in headlines today . There is a Yeah , but\u2026 passage in nearly every major media write-up of Bernie \u2019 s win . \u201c Sanders cements his front-runner status , but his narrow margins\u2026 show how volatile this race is , \u201d is how The New York Times put it .\nIn reality , the results for Sanders cut both ways . On one hand , it \u2019 s amazing he can win any state after years of propaganda depicting him as a half-dead cross of Hitler and Stalin ( MSNBC before New Hampshire outdid itself with Looney Tunes commentary about \u201c executions in Central Park \u201d and a \u201c digital brownshirt brigade \u201d ) .\nOn the other hand , there are signs after New Hampshire that some of the relentless corporate messaging against Sanders is landing . This will inspire orgies of excitement \u2014 it \u2019 s already happening \u2014 as pundits revel in every storyline suggesting Democratic voters are scrambling to find an \u201c electable \u201d alternative .\nGood . Let them . I saw this movie in 2016 and have a fair idea of how it ends . It just won \u2019 t be horrifying this time .\nFour years ago , after New Hampshire , it was crystal clear that Donald Trump was not only going to win his party \u2019 s nomination , but that his path was being actively cleared by the Republican Party establishment and the national news media , whose half-baked efforts to stop him were working in reverse . I wrote this in February 2016 :\nThe [ Republicans ] sent forth to take on Trump have been so incompetent , they can \u2019 t even lose properly . One GOP strategist put it this way : \u201c Maybe 34 [ percent ] is Trump \u2019 s ceiling . But 34 in a five-person race wins\u2026 \u201d The numbers simply don \u2019 t work , unless the field unexpectedly narrows before March .\nEarly mixed results guaranteed that Ted Cruz , John Kasich , Jeb Bush , and Marco Rubio would not drop out soon enough to give any of the others a chance . As a result , the following was obvious at this time four years ago : \u201c Trump will probably enjoy at least a five-horse race through Super Tuesday . \u201d\nIn hindsight , those Republican challengers were so villainously terrible that none would have beaten Trump in a two-person race . Still , Bush \u2019 s backers knew their man was roadkill by New Hampshire , yet didn \u2019 t pull the plug . Kasich , who in a rare moment of self-awareness was ready to bail after Iowa ( \u201c If we get smoked up there , I \u2019 m going back to Ohio , \u201d he fumed in New Hampshire ) , let himself be fooled by one surprise second-place finish .\nAll pledged to be committed to stopping Trump but accelerated his victory by staying in too long . Popular disgust was also enhanced by delusional news-media hype surrounding a succession of would-be \u201c real \u201d candidates .\nAll of this is happening all over again , only this time it \u2019 s Democrats who are committing ritualistic self-abuse , seemingly in a conspiracy with one another and the news media to push as many votes as possible to a hated outsider . I thought this outcome might be possible for Bernie nearly a year ago :\nThe 30,000-foot pundit view on Sanders \u2019 chances should be that he , of course , has a chance , one rooted in the same logic that saw Trump win . He is an unconventional candidate with an at least somewhat insoluble base of support , running in an overlarge field of mostly traditional politicians , many of whom will take votes from one another .\nStill , no one could have predicted that even the idiosyncratic particulars of the 2016 and 2020 races would be so alike .\nIn 2016 , Iowa \u2019 s Republican caucus was won by Cruz , but press wizards gushed over the \u201c Marcomentum \u201d of third-place Rubio , who acted like he \u2019 d won with a soaringly pompous address that somehow evoked both Obama and Henry V :\nThey told me that we have no chance because my hair wasn \u2019 t gray enough and my boots were too high\u2026 But tonight , tonight here in Iowa , the people of this great state have sent a very clear message .\nFour days before the New Hampshire vote , Rubio stepped on a rake in a debate , repeating the \u201c let \u2019 s dispel with the fiction that Barack Obama doesn \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s doing \u201d schtick four times in a viral fiasco . The New York Times declared \u201c the End of Marcomentum \u201d roughly 10 days after it began .\nThis year the standout haughty victory declaration in Iowa was given by a different human haircut , Pete Buttigieg , who told Iowans \u201c you have shocked the nation , \u201d with zero percent of the vote in .\nUnlike Rubio , Pete could argue he technically won , but otherwise , the story was the same . Press swooned \u2013 \u201c # Pete-mentum is no joke , \u201d declared the Daily News \u2013 only to watch as the Great Electable Hope stepped on a rake in the New Hampshire debate , with Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar both kicking him in the balls on his race record .\nLike clockwork , Pete was no longer the new hotness . With about 10 percent of the results in Tuesday night , Gloria Borger on CNN opened the floodgates on the inevitable next gambit .\n\u201c Klomentum ? \u201d she asked Anderson Cooper . The latter responded , correctly , that the horrible word sounded like something he took for his sciatica .\nKlomentum was instantly a thing . \u201c [ Cory ] Booker and [ Kamala ] Harris looking at # Klomentum tonight , \u201d tweeted Dave Weigel of The Washington Post , over a pop-art cartoon of a woman thinking , \u201c It should have been me\u2026 \u201d \u201c When # Klomentum is more than a Twitter joke , \u201d tweeted Edward Isaac-Dovere of the Atlantic .\nKlobuchar spokeswoman Carlie Waibel actually \u201c confirmed \u201d to The New York Times that \u201c it \u2019 s Klomentum , not Klobmentum . \u201d\nOne of the lessons of 2016 was that cheeseball clich\u00e9s like \u201c the Big Mo , \u201d \u201c straight talk , \u201d and the \u201c beer test \u201d no longer had traction .
