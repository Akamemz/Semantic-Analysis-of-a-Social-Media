Economically have we eaten a lot of our seed corn here , \u201d Biden said during the Democrat presidential debate . \u201c The ability of us to use leverages that were available before have been used up by this god-awful tax cut of $ 1.9 trillion and the fact that we have used , the fed will be of little consequence now . They \u2019 ve already used what leverage they have . \u201d\nVerdict : False . Long-term interest rates are at all time lows , implying a robust appetite for the federal government \u2019 s Treasury bonds . And inflation is currently running below the Fed \u2019 s target , indicating that deficit spending is not creating a supply shortage that would push up prices .\nIn short , there is no evidence that the U.S. is fiscally constrained by current borrowing or past deficits . Our seed corn is still right there for us to use as we need it .\nIt is possible that the federal government \u2019 s fiscal deficits are higher than they would have been without the tax cuts , although that is unclear since we do not know if the economy would have grown by as much absent the tax cuts . Tax cuts arguably boosted economic growth higher than it would have been in an era in which the Fed was hiking interest rates , import tariffs were rising , and the trade war with China was dampening economic growth around the globe .\nWhat \u2019 s more , even economists who have concluded the cuts added to the deficit find that the tax cuts only account for around half of the additional borrowing . The other half is due to rising spending .\nJoe Weisenthal , the Bloomberg T.V . anchor , recently tweeted that interest rates prove there is no fiscal problem created by the higher deficits .",
