    "content": "LAS VEGAS\u2014 Donald Trump refused Wednesday to commit to respecting the results of the presidential election if his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton wins , hinting at a challenge to one of the longtime traditions of American democracy .\n\u201c I will tell you at the time . I will keep you in suspense , \u201d the Republican nominee said here at the third and final presidential debate . \u201c That \u2019 s horrifying , \u201d Mrs. Clinton replied . \u201c That is not the way our democracy works . \u201d\nThe debate at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas was a chance for Mr. Trump to regain momentum in the presidential race , which national and battleground state polls show Mrs. Clinton leading . But the evening \u2019 s most striking moment came when moderator Chris Wallace asked if the GOP nominee would follow the guidance of his running mate Mike Pence and his daughter , Ivanka , and support the winner even if it wasn \u2019 t him .\nMr. Trump demurred , and said Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s very candidacy was proof of conspiracy against him , citing her improper use of private email as secretary of state . \u201c She should not be allowed to run . Just in that respect , I say it \u2019 s rigged , \u201d he said .\nReaction was swift , and negative , from some quarters . \u201c If he loses it will not be because the system is \u2018 rigged , \u2019 but because he failed as a candidate , \u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , who competed with Mr. Trump in the GOP primaries .\nThe debate started with a more measured tone compared with their first two showdowns , as Mr. Trump sought to present a more presidential posture that could reassure wavering Republicans and independents about his candidacy . He and Mrs. Clinton offered differing visions over social , economic and foreign policy , and attacked one another harshly over their personal conduct .\nMrs. Clinton pointed to his complaints about his defeat in the Iowa primary , the lawsuit against Trump University and losing an Emmy for his reality TV show . \u201c Every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction , he claims whatever it is , is rigged against him , \u201d she said .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s response to the query differed from the one he gave in the first debate . \u201c If she wins , I will absolutely support her , \u201d he said then , though he added that he doubted she would win . The differing answers reflect the contours of the race over the course of the three presidential debates . At that time , polls were tighter and Mr. Trump was seen as having momentum . Since the first face-off in New York , the advantage has shifted to Mrs. Clinton , giving her a double-digit lead in several national polls .\nThe bitterness that has developed in recent weeks between the two camps spilled over toward the end of the debate , when Mr. Trump interrupted Mrs. Clinton and called her \u201c such a nasty woman . \u201d\nThe election has featured scant discussion over social issues , but Mr. Wallace put these matters on the table at the start with a discussion over the Supreme Court , a timely matter given that a vacancy currently on the court .\nMr. Trump promised he would appoint justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade abortion decision and protect gun rights . \u201c They will have a conservative bent , \u201d he said . \u201c I will be appointing pro-life judges . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton said she would choose justices who would protect abortion rights , same-sex marriage and overturn Citizens United , which removed limits on corporate and union spending in elections . \u201c The Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people , not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy , \u201d she said .\nBut the debate soon tilted toward the personal attacks that have dominated this presidential contest . Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Trump of being a \u201c puppet \u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin , whom she tied to the hack of her campaign chairman \u2019 s personal email account . \u201c No puppet , \u201d Mr. Trump shot back at Mrs. Clinton . \u201c You \u2019 re the puppet . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s pretty clear that you won \u2019 t admit that the Russians engaged in cyberattacks , that you encouraged spying against our people , that you are willing to spout the Putin line , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said .\n\u201c She has no idea , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way . \u201d\nOn immigration , Mr. Trump emphasized border security , and the wall he wants to build on the southern border . \u201c We have no country if we have no border , \u201d he said . He accused Mrs. Clinton of supporting \u201c amnesty \u201d for those in the country illegally .\nMrs. Clinton said she voted when she was in the Senate for border security as part of a larger immigration package , but wants to give safe harbor to illegal immigrant already living in the U.S. \u201c I don \u2019 t want to rip families apart . I don \u2019 t want to be sending parents away from children , \u201d she said . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country . \u201d\nOn the economy , Mrs. Clinton offered a positive vision , something her advisers saw as an imperative for her going into the debate . She promised the \u201c biggest jobs program since World War II \u201d by investing in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing . She said she would increase the minimum wage and make college \u201c debt free \u201d for some families .\n\u201c His whole plan is to cut taxes , give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and add $ 20 trillion to our debt , \u201d she said . \u201c It will truly be trickle-down economics . \u201d\nMr. Trump said he wanted to \u201c get government out of the taxes and regulations \u201d and promised to end the North American Free Trade Agreement , the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada .\n\u201c We are going to cut taxes massively , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c We are going to start the engine rolling again . \u201d\nHe blamed Mrs. Clinton and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , for Nafta , which Mr. Clinton signed , and for backing the pending Trans Pacific Partnership . Mrs. Clinton again vowed to oppose the Asian trade deal but moved fast to turn the trade issue against Mr. Trump , saying he had bought Chinese steel and aluminum for his buildings . Mr. Trump replied that Mrs. Clinton had been in office for 30 years and asked why she didn \u2019 t \u201c make it impossible for me to do that . \u201d\n\u201c He goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is , but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers , not American steelworkers , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said .\nThe former secretary of state pivoted off that critique to contrast their respective careers . \u201c When I was in the Situation Room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice , he was hosting the \u2018 Celebrity Apprentice , \u2019 \u201d she said .\n\u201c I \u2019 m happy to compare my 30 years of experience , what I have done for this country , trying to help in every way I could\u2026with your 30 years , and I will let the American people make that decision . \u201d\nThe question of Mr. Trump \u2019 s conduct with women again surfaced . He accused the women who have charged since the last debate that he groped or kissed them without permission of lying . \u201c I think they want either fame or her campaign did it . I think it \u2019 s her campaign , \u201d he said .\nMrs. Clinton replied by quoting Mr. Trump \u2019 s defense , offered at rallies , that these women weren \u2019 t attractive enough to warrant such advances .\n\u201c Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger . He goes after their dignity , their self-worth , and I don \u2019 t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn \u2019 t know what that feels like , \u201d she said .\nLeaving here after their final debate , the Democratic nominee has the upper hand heading into the home stretch , leading in many polls and enjoying a big cash advantage as the candidates concentrate on Ohio , North Carolina and Pennsylvania , where both will be campaigning in the coming days , as well as Florida .\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton , in their final debate on Wednesday , offered a vision of what America would look like \u2014 if the other were elected . How grim did they get ? WSJ \u2019 s Jason Bellini has # TheShortAnswer .\nThe two candidates are supposed to begin the postdebate phase of the campaign with a few jokes .\nThe White House contenders will reunite in New York on Thursday for the Al Smith charity dinner , where candidates traditionally poke fun at themselves and offer gracious comments to one another .\nMaureen Sherry , a board member for the foundation that puts on the dinner , said candidates in past years have mixed easily even in the closing weeks of fiercely fought campaigns , including at a small private reception that precedes the televised dinner .
