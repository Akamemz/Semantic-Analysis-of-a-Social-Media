    "content": "The big headline is that Barack Obama still leads Mitt Romney in Florida , Ohio and Wisconsin , but his advantage is shrinking :\nNew CBS News/New York Times/Quinnipiac University poll numbers from three important swing states show a tight presidential race getting tighter . The poll shows President Obama 's lead in Florida is down to just three points . Mr. Obama had a six-point lead there at the end of July . The president is still leading Mitt Romney by six points in Ohio . In Wisconsin , home state of Romney 's running mate Rep. Paul Ryan , Romney 's now in a virtual tie with the president with just two points between them .\nThe good news for Romney is these CBS/NYT/Q-polls demonstrate that he 's drawing closer to the incumbent in crucial battleground states . The better news for Republicans is that these surveys are based on flawed samples , so the Republican is likely faring better than the numbers let on . Ed Morrissey lays it out :\nLet \u2019 s just cut to the chase . What do the partisan splits in the samples look like ? Let \u2019 s lay out all three states and compare the D/R/I of this poll to 2008 and 2010 : Florida : 34/28/32 ; 2008 37/34/29 , 2010 36/36/28 Ohio : 34/26/34 ; 2008 39/31/30 , 2010 36/37/28 Wisconsin : 32/28/33 ; 2008 39/33/29 , 2010 37/36/28\nIn other words , the Florida poll sample is D+6 , whereas the mean Florida electorate from 2008 and 2010 ( a fair benchmark for the 2012 elctorate ) was just D+1.5 . That 's a gap of 4.5 percentage points ; ( Obama leads by three ) . The Ohio poll is based upon a D+8 sample , whereas the mean '08/'10 hybrid Buckeye State electorate was D+3.5 . Hence , a gap of 4.5 percentage points ; ( Obama leads by six ) . The Wisconsin poll sample is D+4 , while the state 's combined electorate was D+2.5 ; ( Obama leads by two ) .\nAnother telling item from the internals : 2008 McCain voters are severely under-sampled in the Florida and Ohio surveys . The new poll 's Florida respondents voted for Obama over McCain by a nine-point margin . The actual election result was Obama by three . The poll 's Ohio respondents backed Obama vs. McCain by 13 points . The actual election result was Obama by four-and-a-half . All in all -- and based on other recent polling data -- I suspect Romney is tied or slightly ahead in Florida , tied or slightly behind in Wisconsin , and tied or slightly behind in Ohio . He 'd rather be leading across the board , of course . Eleven weeks to make the sale .\nUPDATE - A new USA Today/Gallup poll shows Americans souring on politics , with a record number of voters identifying as independents . Romney holds a `` clear edge '' on the economy , and a larger lead on deficits . Obama leads on several other issues . More voters say Obama is attacking Romney unfairly than vice versa , the GOP has an enthuisiasm advantage , and the generic Congressional ballot is exactly tied . Romney leads men by eight , Obama leads women by the same margin .",
