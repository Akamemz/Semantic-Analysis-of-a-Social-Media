    "content": "A fuller picture is emerging of a confrontation between a Catholic high school student and a Native American elder at Friday 's March for Life .\nNick Sandmann was among a group of fellow students from Kentucky 's Covington Catholic High School attending the march on the National Mall , while Native American Nathan Phillips was also there for a separate rally for indigenous peoples .\nOne video of the encounter shows the students chanting and laughing as Phillips drummed in Sandmann 's face . The footage was shared on social media and went viral , claiming that the boys blocked the Native American so they could taunt him . Liberal media outlets like CNN picked up the story and ran with it , fueling the outrage from leftists who spewed hate against the boys , assuming they were racist because some of them were wearing `` Make America Great Again '' hats .\nBut longer videos of the encounter show the boys standing in that spot for a long period of time before Phillips walked up to them to play his drum right in the middle of their group .\n`` The protester everyone has seen in the video began playing his drum as he waded into the crowd , which parted for him . I did not see anyone try to block his path , '' Sandmann said , contradicting the Native American elder 's claims that one of the students would n't let him move . `` He locked eyes with me and approached me , coming within inches of my face . He played his drum the entire time he was in my face . ''\nThe students were later condemned for their actions , but Sandmann , who was shown standing in front of Mr. Phillips smiling , says he was only trying to calm things down in the midst of the chaos . The teen explained that by `` remaining motionless and calm , '' he believed he was `` helping defuse the situation . ''\n`` I said a silent prayer that the situation would not get out of hand , '' he wrote .\nLikewise , Phillips says it was his intent as well to try to calm down things between conflicting groups .\n`` They were making remarks to each other ... ( such as ) 'In my state those Indians are nothing but a bunch of drunks . ' How do I report that ? '' Phillips said of the students . `` These young people were just roughshodding through our space , like what 's been going on for 500 years here \u2014 just walking through our territories , feeling like 'this is ours . ' ''\nBut then on NPR Monday morning , Phillips said he had gone over to calm things down because a group of protesters , whom he compared to a black version of the racist group called the Westboro Baptists , was stoking confrontation .\nAnd Sandmann denies the students made derogatory statements , suggesting it was members of that third group affiliated with the Black Hebrew Israelites that were fomenting unrest , allegedly yelling negative statements at both groups . He noted the Black Israelites called he and his fellow students `` racists , '' \u2033bigots , '' `` white crackers '' and `` incest kids . '' One video also shows them using the `` n '' word , telling an African-American boy who appeared to be with the school group that the white people were going to steal his organs .\nMeanwhile , Sandmann responded to critics on social media who he says erroneously interpreted his actions as being racist .\n`` I am being called every name in the book , including a racist , and I will not stand for this mob-like character assassination of my family 's name , '' he said .\nNewly surfaced video shows Native American activist was not `` surrounded '' by # CovingtonCatholic students but instead * approached them * from afar . pic.twitter.com/brHMYpBUJC \u2014 Chris Menahan ( @ infolibnews ) January 20 , 2019",
