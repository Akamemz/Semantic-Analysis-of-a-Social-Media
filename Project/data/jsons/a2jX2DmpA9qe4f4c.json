Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has charged authorities in her home state with suppressing turnout, named her public interest group Fair Fight Action.\n\nAccess vs. security\n\nThe pandemic has added another layer of complexity with the new emphasis it has put on voting by mail. President Trump says he opposes expanding voting by mail, and his allies, including White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, call the process rife with opportunities for fraud.\n\nEven so, Trump and McEnany both voted by mail this year in Florida, and Republican officials across the country have encouraged voting by mail.\n\nDemocrats, who have made election security and voting access a big part of their political brand for several years, argue that the pandemic might discourage people from going to old-fashioned polling sites.\n\nIf there's rough agreement about that away from the White House, there are many disputes about the specifics \u2014 what practices will be permitted based on what the parties perceive as beneficial for them.\n\nA study by Stanford University found that voting by mail yielded a small but roughly equal increase in turnout between the parties.\n\nIt isn't clear yet how much voting by mail might expand by Election Day, but it's the subject of lawsuits across the country; apart from the politics, absentee ballot-printing is a boutique business and its capacity will be tested \u2014 as may that of the Postal Service.\n\nHow common is voter fraud?\n\nIt exists, but it's very rare.\n\nDespite anecdotal cases of people voting fraudulently in person or suspicious ballots appearing in the mail, most of the time, in most places, the way elections in the U.S. are processed is legitimate.\n\nSince the pandemic, some Republican officials at the state level have acknowledged that the party's language around fraud may now be putting voting at risk by amplifying fraud concerns out of proportion.\n\nRead more from NPR's Miles Parks about the integrity of voting by mail.\n\nTrump sometimes says that large numbers of people vote illegally in the United States, but a panel he appointed to investigate that ostensible problem could not substantiate it. Listen to an interview with a member of that commission.\n\nStill, anecdotal cases of fraud crop up across the country.\n\nVoter suppression\n\nActivists frequently call out what they term suppression.\n\nIn a dispute this spring in Nevada, for example, Democrats sued to stop the state from sending mail-in ballots only to people who had voted in recent elections rather than to all registered voters.\n\nDemocrats said the state's plan would disenfranchise some citizens by leaving them out of the primary; Republicans argued that states' voter rolls are often inaccurate and that sending out ballots to everyone could lead to the ballots getting lost or winding up in the wrong hands \u2014 opening up the prospect for fraud.\n\nVoter rolls are often the focus of disputes for these reasons.\n\nPeople die, move \u2014 and move out of state \u2014 and so authorities periodically need to delete names. How frequently that happens, and for what reasons, can become controversial and the kernel of legal and political warfare between the parties.\n\nLikewise with voter identification documents.\n\nIn Texas, for example, the Republican-dominated state legislature deemed that handgun licenses were acceptable identification at the polls \u2014 but student IDs, even those issued by the state's own universities, were not.\n\nFor all the discussion about the effect of voter ID laws, however, a study last year found that whatever impact those laws might have is offset by increased organization and activism by nonwhite voters \u2014 leading to no change in registration or turnout.\n\nAnother battleground is early and absentee voting. Rules vary by state, with some requiring more explanation than others as to what's permissible.\n\nBitter lessons\n\nThe parties today have arrived at this moment after years of what they would argue were bad experiences with elections at the hands of their opponents.\n\nRepublicans, among other things, sometimes point to what they believe was cheating in the 1960 presidential race. Alleged Democratic chicanery, in this telling, threw the results to John F. Kennedy and cost the race for Richard Nixon.\n\nFraudulent IDs, undocumented immigrants voting, people being \"bused in\" on Election Day remain consistent themes when Republicans talk about elections.\n\nDemocrats look to the decades of Jim Crow discrimination that kept many black voters out of elections.\n\nMore recently, they look at the Supreme Court's 2000 decision that handed the outcome of that election to George W.

Republicans are more likely to argue that casting a vote is a privilege of citizenship to be earned and safeguarded with restrictions and security.\n\nThey also point to what they call the principles of federalism and the need for people to be engaged at the state and local level with the conduct of elections \u2014 not for broad mandates from Washington.\n\nDemocrats are more likely to argue that voting is a right and that the barriers to casting a ballot should be as low as practical.
