    "content": "It was one of Donald Trump \u2019 s favorite conspiracy theories \u2014 that Saudi Arabia was behind 9/11 , and the U.S. government is covering it up : \u201c You will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center because they have papers in there that are very secret , you may find it \u2019 s the Saudis , OK ? \u201d he thundered at a primary-season rally in Blufftown , South Carolina .\nBut when the Republican platform committee set about putting Trump \u2019 s words into policy , calling for the declassification of 28 pages of the 9/11 Commission \u2019 s report relating to Saudi Arabia , the plank was quietly shelved . The identity of the person whose behind-the-scenes intervention helped scuttle the deal was , perhaps , a surprise : Jared Kushner , Trump \u2019 s son-in-law .\nKushner is the campaign \u2019 s unofficial ambassador to Jewish donors who fretted that the release of damaging information about Saudi Arabia could alter the balance of power in the Mideast . But the intervention \u2014 by one of Trump \u2019 s family members seeking to rein in the candidate 's more destabilizing positions \u2014 has become increasingly common .\nThe young New York City real estate and media mogul , who is married to Trump \u2019 s daughter Ivanka , has become the most powerful operative atop the campaign in the month since the candidate \u2019 s children banded together and forced the ouster of Corey Lewandowski and his \u201c Let Trump be Trump \u201d approach .\nNow , Kushner is making key hires , fine-tuning and sharpening Trump \u2019 s speeches and serving as the central emissary behind the scenes , meeting privately last month with House Speaker Paul Ryan , having direct conversations with billionaire Sheldon Adelson and asserting influence on everything from Trump \u2019 s search for a running mate \u2014 he pushed hard for Newt Gingrich , largely at Adelson \u2019 s behest \u2014 to his tweets .\nSince Lewandowski \u2019 s dismissal , executed by three Kushner associates , including Trump \u2019 s son Donald Jr. , no one has officially been named the new campaign manager . And while Kushner is working alongside Paul Manafort , a seasoned political operative three decades his senior who has been preoccupied with convention plans , there is a sense that the baby-faced billionaire is now effectively at the helm of a presidential campaign that is more of a family business than any in recent history .\n\u201c In my 30 years in the business , I \u2019 ve never seen such a positive impact from such a large family on such a complex campaign , \u201d said Michael Caputo , a longtime Trump associate who oversaw Trump \u2019 s New York primary campaign before getting ousted .\nTrump Tower insiders could see this coming for months . Trump holds a standing meeting with the children and his top advisers Monday mornings at 9:30 . And sometimes he listens , at least to the family .\nTrump tempered his attack on Planned Parenthood during a primary debate last spring , for instance , at the urging of his daughter Ivanka . In March , he appeared at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee 's annual policy conference and read a speech Kushner had written for him almost verbatim , relenting as he agreed to a teleprompter . He dispatched his two sons , both hunters , to go on a shooting photo op with reporters and backers in Iowa in an effort to solidify his credibility with rural voters and Second Amendment enthusiasts .\nKushner , perhaps most significantly , has developed a personal relationship with Adelson , who he now contacts directly without going through the billionaire \u2019 s aide , Andy Abboud , according to a campaign source . This past week , as Trump neared an announcement about a running mate , Kushner and the children flew hastily to Indiana to talk through the final choice and to keep their father from changing his mind .\nAnd now , as the nominee and the Republican National Committee struggle to unify the GOP around this candidate , Trump \u2019 s children have even more decisively and deliberately taken control , traveling with their father to meet with GOP lawmakers in Washington and standing as better surrogates than any of the dozens of B-list Republicans the campaign has officially enlisted .\nTrump \u2019 s children will each take a turn on stage in Cleveland this week , all in prime time \u2014 a reflection of the disinterest among some of the party \u2019 s more traditional standard-bearers and vulnerable members of Congress in sharing a stage with Trump but also the importance of Trump \u2019 s offspring , who are being asked to help soften their father \u2019 s sharp edges to general election voters .\n\u201c If I was working with them , I \u2019 d put them onstage too , \u201d said Sam Nunberg , who was Trump \u2019 s political director for four years until being fired last summer shortly after Lewandowski was brought in ( Trump is now suing him for allegedly breaching a nondisclosure agreement ) . \u201c The kids are celebrities . He 's going to turn them into surrogates who can fan out to all the states . \u201d\nArguably , the Trump kids are the least controversial element of the family brand . Sen. Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) , forced to take the stage with Trump earlier this month at a rally in North Carolina and seemingly at a loss for what to say , spoke briefly but glowingly about the candidate \u2019 s progeny .\n\u201c Even anti-Trump Republicans and pro-Hillary Democrats admire these kids , \u201d said Caputo . \u201c And I always say : \u2018 That \u2019 s a reflection of the father that raised them . \u2019 \u201d\nIndeed , Trump \u2019 s three adult children \u2014 a fourth , Tiffany Trump , is an outlier in that she has little role within the campaign \u2014 are critical in softening their father \u2019 s edges with swing voters , especially as Trump himself has seemed unwilling or unable to tone down his own bombast and heed his party \u2019 s frantic calls to focus on Hillary Clinton and not get distracted by side issues with little bearing on the general election .\nAccording to campaign insiders , no one seems to make Trump prouder than Ivanka , his oldest daughter , who is a mother of two , fashion model , designer , Trump Corp. executive and Manhattan socialite who demonstrates poise and message control . No child is more capable of casting a glow upon her thin-skinned , insult-spewing father that could allow voters to see him in a more forgiving light . And no one has more sway when it comes to getting a hard-headed boss to heed advice that \u2019 s difficult to hear .\nUnable to vote in New York \u2019 s GOP primary because she wasn \u2019 t registered as a Republican , Ivanka prevailed in getting Trump to stop short of completely disavowing Planned Parenthood during a Republican primary debate where most rivals were toeing the party line with calls to defund the organization entirely \u2014 a rare instance where Trump , who \u2019 d already endeared himself to the base , was taking a centrist position early on and avoiding the mistakes of previous , establishment-styled nominees .\nDonald Trump , Jr. , Ivanka Trump , Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump celebrate their father 's nomination in Cleveland on July 19 . | AP Photo\nSimilarly , Ivanka was among those who finally convinced her father to stop accusing the U.S.-born federal judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit of bias based on his Mexican heritage .\nLong skeptical of Lewandowski , who she viewed as an enabler of Trump \u2019 s most coarse and self-sabotaging impulses , she was also an advocate for bringing in Manafort to run things in late March and for Lewandowski \u2019 s eventual firing on June 21 .\nCampaign advisers inside Trump Tower recognize the unique bond between Trump and his successful daughter and that , as one Trump insider said , he clearly \u201c wants her to be the face of his brand into the next generation. \u201d It \u2019 s not only her appearance but her business acumen and warm personality that has implicitly elevated her over her brothers : Donald Jr. , who is a lead on several of his father \u2019 s business projects including the redevelopment of Washington , D.C. \u2019 s , Old Post Office into a Trump hotel , and Eric Trump , who helps oversee his father \u2019 s portfolio of golf courses and hotels .\nFor a long time , Kushner was \u201c just a trailer on that [ Ivanka ] train , \u201d another campaign staffer , speaking privately , explained . \u201c But the more Trump got to know and hear Jared \u2019 s thoughts about the campaign , the more he trusted him and saw himself in him , \u201d the staffer said , recalling an instance in Trump \u2019 s office when the boss ended a phone call with Kushner by encouraging him to call him directly at any time .\n\u201c Jared is actually more successful than Trump was at his age , \u201d the staffer continued . \u201c So his opinion became more and more valuable to Trump the more he saw how smart and reasoned he is . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s increasing reliance on his son-in-law \u2014 and Kushner \u2019 s increasing assertiveness as a political adviser \u2014 troubled Lewandowski . Likewise , Kushner , who wanted to replace Lewandowski after Trump \u2019 s second-place finish in Iowa , never meshed with the gritty operative guiding the campaign . Two sources recall a campaign event this spring at which Kushner happened upon the fiery Lewandowski yelling at a low-level staffer . \u201c If you do that again , you \u2019 re gone , \u201d Kushner reportedly told his father-in-law \u2019 s campaign manager , according to one witness to that interaction .\nAround that time , Manafort was brought on to steady the campaign after its embarrassing setback in Wisconsin and to clean up a delegate operation that Lewandowski had apparently overlooked . \u201c When Corey told staffers not to talk to Manafort and then fired one [ James Baker ] because he did , that also caught Kushner \u2019 s eye , and the situation bound him and the kids more closely to Manafort , \u201d one Trump confidant said .\nLewandowski and Kushner also battled over the Adelson portfolio , which both wanted to control . Kushner and Adelson had worked to set up a trip for Trump to visit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel \u2014 but without informing Trump himself . Given the controversy at that time over Trump \u2019 s proposed Muslim ban , Trump didn \u2019 t want to go to Israel and empowered Lewandowski to squash reports that a trip was in the works .\nAccording to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation , it was around that time that Lewandowski , who continued to oversee the campaign \u2019 s communications strategy , began pushing reporters to write negative stories about Kushner \u2014 a fact that made its way back to Trump \u2019 s children and one that was , according to one insider , \u201c the final straw \u201d leading to his firing .\n\u201c Ironically , Corey shutting out a lot of reporters deemed to be unfriendly led many of them to establish relationships with the kids to get information that way , \u201d one campaign insider explained . \u201c But the kids wound up getting information from the embeds about things Lewandowski was doing that informed their thinking on him . So , in that way , his strategy backfired . \u201d\nManafort quietly cultivated the children from the moment he joined the campaign . His cool confidence contrasted with Lewandowski \u2019 s frenetic energy ; and while both operatives began to engage in a war of media leaks , Manafort shrugged off negative stories while Lewandowski only got more aggressive , according to campaign sources . Manafort `` recognized [ the children \u2019 s ] importance early on and made sure they had everything they needed to be confident in his leadership , \u201d one source said . \u201c They \u2019 ve all been very curious about the process of running for president , and he \u2019 s always offered his experience and took time to answer their questions : everything from what to expect next to what kind of reporter this person is , he just was a source of credible information . \u201d\nIt took more than two additional months of infighting before Lewandowski \u2019 s firing , which was agreed to and carried out by Kushner and the Trump children on June 21 , days after Manafort told them he was going to resign if Lewandowski wasn \u2019 t axed . His firing broke the internal logjam that had hindered the campaign \u2019 s growth , and dozens of prospective employees , whose hiring Lewandowski had been blocking , were finally added to the campaign \u2014 mostly with Kushner granting final approval .\nBut being members of the family political business has not provided Ivanka Trump or her husband the ability to control the candidate . And if there was any doubt about that , Trump made sure Kushner knew when he publicly disavowed one of his son-in-law \u2019 s unauthorized actions .\nIt was the July 4 weekend , and Donald Trump , responding to a new poll showing that a majority of voters found Clinton to be \u201c corrupt , \u201d tweeted an image of the Democrat with the text \u201c Most corrupt candidate ever \u201d inside a Star of David . The criticism was swift and devastating .\n`` A Star of David , a pile of cash , and suggestions of corruption . Donald Trump again plays to the white supremacists , '' said Erick Erickson , the influential blogger and radio host who has been a constant critic of Trump .\n`` Donald Trump should stop playing the blame game and accept that his campaign tweeted an image with obvious anti-Semitic overtones and that , reportedly , was lifted from a white supremacist website , '' said Jonathan Greenblatt , CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League .\nAfter conferring privately , Kushner , Manafort and newly hired communications adviser Jason Miller were in agreement : The tweet should come down , despite Trump \u2019 s stated preference for keeping it up . They told social media director Dan Scavino to delete the tweet .\nTrump , whose personal policy has long been never to back off or apologize , was infuriated , according to sources close to Trump .\n`` 'You should n't have taken it down , ' '' he said , as if he were speaking to a nameless staffer , during a rally in Ohio days later . `` You know they took the star down .

' ''\nKushner \u2019 s attempt to defuse the situation with an op-ed column a day earlier defending his father-in-law from claims of anti-Semitism also drew blowback \u2014 from one of his employees as well as several estranged relatives \u2014 and only prolonged media coverage of the controversy , distracting from the congressional testimony by the FBI director about Clinton \u2019 s private email server that was taking place at the same time .\n\u201c This is the problem : He has no political experience , \u201d said one campaign source . \u201c He has experience buying buildings . \u201d",
