The provision generating heated opposition from Veterans of Foreign Wars and allied lawmakers would cut retirement benefits for military retirees by $ 6 billion over 10 years .\n`` It 's unacceptable to single out our men and women in uniform in this way , '' said Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H. , who on Monday is joining New Hampshire veterans groups to protest the bill .\nThe turbulence comes ahead of a key test vote on Tuesday . In sharp contrast to the confident statements issued by House leaders ahead of their vote last week , Senate leaders indicate they 're still corralling support .\n`` The struggle is still on in the United States Senate , '' Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , said in an interview on Sunday .\nDemocrats need to hold most their caucus of 55 senators together and pick up a handful of GOP senators in order to reach the 60-vote threshold to advance the bill .\nBut the Republican `` no '' votes were piling up over the weekend . Unlike in the House side , where Speaker John Boehner aggressively battled conservative groups trying to kill the bill , GOP leaders in the Senate are signaling opposition , or at least resistance , to the package . One member of the leadership team , Sen. John Thune of South Dakota , announced Friday that he opposes the deal because it breaches spending caps put in place by a 2011 budget deal `` and does n't include meaningful spending reforms that address our debt and deficit . ''\nMeanwhile , Ayotte and other senators are rallying opposition against the military retiree provision .\nThe bill includes a 1 percent reduction in cost-of-living benefits for many retirees under 62 years old . It also requires most federal civilian employees to pay more toward their pensions -- however , that provision affects only new hires , while the change for military retirees could affect those currently serving .\n`` Unfortunately , our current and future military retirees were not provided with similar protections that current civilian federal employees are receiving under this act , '' Ayotte , along with Sens . Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , and Roger Wicker , R-Miss. , wrote in a letter to colleagues .\nThey called the provision `` unacceptable . '' They estimated that a 42-year-old sergeant first class retiree would lose roughly $ 72,000 under this change .\nThe three senators indicated they could support the bill if the military retiree provision is changed . It 's unclear whether Senate leaders would consider making such changes -- as that likely would require another vote in the House .\nDurbin , speaking on CBS ' `` Face the Nation , '' predicted Senate leaders will need `` about eight Republicans '' to support the bill on Tuesday -- indicating he expects about three Democratic defections .\n`` I feel we 'll have a good , strong showing from the Democratic side .
