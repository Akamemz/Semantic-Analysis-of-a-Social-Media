Those fires continued to burn overnight Wednesday and into Thursday as the protests showed no signs of abating .\n\u201c The main thing is to protect human life , \u201d said Mr. Yanukovych , who replaced the nation \u2019 s army chief earlier Wednesday .\nPresident Obama warned Ukraine that \u201c violence is not the path \u201d for dealing with civil unrest and said his administration would hold officials there responsible for the deaths of protesters , including with possible sanctions .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to be watching closely and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint , to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters , \u201d Mr. Obama said in Toluca , Mexico , where he was attending a summit with the leaders of Mexico and Canada . \u201c There will be consequences if people step over the line . \u201d\nLater in the evening , Mr. Obama said at a press conference with the other two North American leaders that if the truce is implemented , \u201c it could provide space for the sides to resolve their disagreements peacefully . \u201d\nMr. Obama made the comments a day after violence erupted between riot police and protesters in Kiev , injuring 241 in addition to the fatalities . It was the worst violence in nearly three months of anti-government demonstrations in a long-simmering domestic dispute over whether Ukraine , which became independent upon the Soviet Union \u2019 s dissolution in the early 1990s , should engage more with the West or maintain its ties to Russia .\nAs Mr. Obama arrived in Mexico , U.S. officials said they were working with European allies on possible sanctions intended to stop the killings in Ukraine . Both protesters and security forces have been killed in the violence this week .\n\u201c The United States condemns in the strongest terms the violence that \u2019 s taking place , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c We hold the Ukrainian government primarily responsible for making sure that it is dealing with peaceful protesters in an appropriate way , that the Ukrainian people are able to assemble and speak freely about their interests without fear of repression . \u201d\nThe protests in Ukraine , a nation of 45 million , have grown into a broader ideological struggle between the West and Russia .\nDemonstrations broke out in November after Mr. Yanukovych rejected an accord with the European Union in favor of stronger ties with Russia , including a $ 15 billion bailout . Thousands of people , outraged that their government had rejected integration with Europe , began peaceful protests in central Kiev .\nAs the unrest expanded into assaults of activists and other violence , many Ukrainians are less concerned now about engagement with the West than they are with toppling Mr. Yanukovych , whom they view as promoting his own interests and serving as a puppet of Moscow .
