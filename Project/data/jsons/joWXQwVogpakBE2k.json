    "content": "Since the first papal encyclical on modern economic questions , Rerum Novarum , was promulgated in 1891 , Catholic pontiffs have had harsh words for `` unbridled capitalism '' and `` philosophical liberalism . '' In Quadragesimo Anno ( 1931 ) , Pope Pius XI wrote that `` the right ordering of economic life can not be left to a free competition of forces . For from this source , as from a poisoned spring , have originated and spread all the errors of individualist economic teaching . '' In Octogesima Adveniens ( 1971 ) , Pope Paul VI argued that `` structures '' should be set up `` in which the rhythm of progress would be regulated with a view to greater justice . ''\nThe upshot\u2014that a capitalist system can not be trusted automatically to produce what the Church views as morally acceptable outcomes\u2014may seem to require Christians to support a robust central government . If society is to be oriented to the common good , surely some person or body needs to have enough power to do the orienting . What , besides the state , can regulate the market ?\nBut when Pope John Paul II gave an audience to the board of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association in 2001 , he offered a different , orthogonal answer : `` As presidents of the major automobile companies of Europe , '' he told them , `` you have important responsibilities , not only in guiding the growth of your own industry , but also in ensuring the right development of an increasingly globalized economy . The process of globalization , while opening up new possibilities for progress , poses urgent questions regarding the very nature and purpose of economic activity . It calls for ethical discernment aimed at protecting the environment and promoting the full human development of millions of men and women . ''\nThe Church 's surprising lesson for partisans of big government is that the best tools for correctly ordering economic life are found in the choices of individual market actors . Because those choices are based not only on their preferences but also on their convictions , people 's moral sensibilities\u2014the extent to which they believe they have ethical obligations to each other\u2014have a powerful and unavoidable effect on the shape of the economy . Contrary to what you might expect , Catholic social teaching suggests that this , not public policy , performs the first and most important regulatory function in a free society .\nThe popes of the last century have been clear that when they speak out against unregulated liberal capitalism , they 're referring to a system in which all involved are concerned solely with their own material advantage and will happily sacrifice others in the pursuit thereof . Per the Catechism of the Catholic Church , `` A theory that makes profit the exclusive norm and ultimate end of economic activity is morally unacceptable . ''\nThe encyclicals paint a grim hypothetical picture in which our moral obligations are subordinated to , if not obliterated by , a dictum of wealth and power uber alles . Blessedly , that picture bears little resemblance to how modern market economies actually function .

The choice is never between markets that are constrained and those that are n't ; it 's between markets shaped by participants with this and that set of beliefs and commitments . The British political philosopher H.B .
