    "content": "Most Democratic and Republican voters agree on a wide range of proposals to boost the economy , from upgrading infrastructure to reducing college costs , casting doubt on the conventional belief that pocketbook issues are hopelessly dividing voters in the 2020 election .\nA Public Agenda/\u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos survey reveals that Americans agree far more than they disagree on ways to make it easier for low- and middle-income people to get good jobs and for corporations to provide them . The poll of Democrats , Republicans and independents is part of the three organizations \u2019 `` Hidden Common Ground 2020 Initiative , '' which seeks to explore areas of agreement on major issues .\nMost Americans , regardless of party affiliation , support proposals to upgrade infrastructure ; provide tax breaks to job-creating businesses ; decrease college costs ; and retrain adults for better-paying positions . The survey of about 1,000 adults was conducted February 20-21 .\nClimate change agreement : Republican and Democratic voters actually agree on many climate change fixes . So why no action ?\nTight Squeeze : Bigger and bigger SUVs , pickups are outgrowing home garages , public parking spaces\n\u201c There is near unanimity in support for multiple policies promoting job creation , ranging from training and education programs to investing in infrastructure and research , \u201d says Ipsos Vice President Chris Jackson .\nVoters express partisan differences on issues like raising the minimum wage , promoting labor unions and easing regulations on businesses . But even those gaps aren \u2019 t as stark as political rhetoric would suggest .\nDemocrats and Republicans also disagree over whether government should bear the burden of job creation . Sixty percent of Democrats say the government is responsible for making sure there are enough good jobs , compared with 35 % of Republicans .\nAnd not surprisingly , Democrats and Republicans have contrasting outlooks on the economy under President Trump . Seventy-one percent of Republicans say the economy is excellent or good \u2013 notwithstanding the recent concerns and market panic sparked by the coronavirus \u2013 compared with 30 % of Democrats and 43 % of independents .\nAnd 62 % of Republicans describe their family \u2019 s financial situation positively , vs. 52 % of Democrats .\nBut most survey respondents agree that state and federal governments can take steps to improve the economy and create good jobs by :\n\u25ba Upgrading public infrastructure , such as roads and bridges , to create good jobs and make the economy more productive : 83 % of Republicans , 85 % of Democrats and 74 % of independents .\n\u25ba Decreasing the cost of colleges and universities so more Americans can get an education and a good job : 72 % of Republicans , 85 % of Democrats and 74 % of independents .\n\u25ba Creating incentives that encourage businesses to bring good jobs they moved overseas back to the U.S. : 86 % of Republicans , 82 % of Democrats and 83 % of independents .\n\u25ba Providing tax breaks to businesses that create good quality jobs in communities that need them : 81 % of Republicans , 69 % of Democrats and 56 % of independents .\nSome of these ideas long have drawn bipartisan support , such as repairing the nation \u2019 s crumbling infrastructure . But the idea is bogged down in political battles over how to pay for it .\nThe fault lines between voters are more pronounced in other areas . Eighty percent of Democrats support raising the minimum wage so every full-time job provides enough income to keep people above the poverty line . The federal pay floor has been stuck at $ 7.25 an hour since 2009 .\nOnly 48 % of Republicans and 54 % of independents back a minimum wage increase , compared with 80 % of Democrats . Yet it may be surprising that roughly half of Republicans and independents favor the proposal , suggesting there could be space for negotiation on how much to increase base pay . For years , the Republican-majority Senate has refused to consider any minimum wage hike , including a bill passed by the Democratic-dominated House last year to more than double the threshold to $ 15 an hour .\nClosing open houses : Will coronavirus keep buyers from house-hunting this spring ?

Those results underscore that while unions may not garner bipartisan support , policymakers could take other steps to help workers to bargain with employers , says Catherine Ruckelshaus , general counsel of the National Employment Law Project , a worker advocacy group .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the problem is with the public , \u201d Schleifer says of longstanding stalemates in Washington . \u201c It \u2019 s really elected officials not being willing or able to move things forward , \u201d perhaps because they \u2019 ve been swayed by lobbyists or industry campaign contributions .\nCharles Hyland , 32 , of Brunswick , Maryland , is an independent who usually votes Democratic and says he \u2019 s \u201c fairly liberal. \u201d He describes the national economy and his financial situation as \u201c fair. \u201d After graduating from college in 2008 , during the depths of the Great Recession , he struggled to launch his photography business and moonlighted as a substitute teacher to make ends meet .\nHe ultimately shut down the firm and now works as a firefighter .
