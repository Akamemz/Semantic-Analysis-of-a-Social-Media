Forget this month . \u2019 \u201d\nAs shops on California Street wait to hear if they qualify for loans under Congress \u2019 coronavirus rescue package , the importance of human connections can be paramount . One local landlord has decided not to collect rent from his business tenants this month .\nPhilip A. Rand Wire Rope and Sling Co. is down some 70 % . The dentist running American Dental and other Boston locations has seen business fall 80 % or more . For small firms , it \u2019 s a race against time . Millions need to see an economic turnaround or federal aid in the next two months or so to avoid closing permanently .\nOn one block of California Street , between the Boston suburbs of Newton and Watertown , more than 15 small businesses ply their trade in widely diverse industries but with a single problem . The state-imposed closing of nonessential companies to stop the spread of the coronavirus has severely cut into their revenue .\nFor a man who has lost 70 % of his business , Philip Rand remains remarkably upbeat .\nThen again , his company , the Philip A. Rand Wire Rope and Sling Co. , has proved remarkably resilient through two world wars , the Spanish flu , the Great Depression , and the Great Recession . A couple of government contracts are currently keeping its four full-time and four part-time workers employed .\n\u201c This is a new adventure ; it \u2019 s a different kind of adventure , \u201d says Mr. Rand , great-grandson of the founder , about the lockdowns that have curtailed or stopped business operations throughout the United States because of the coronavirus threat . \u201c But we are going to survive . ... We have been around since 1911 . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s one of the more positive outlooks along this 500-foot stretch of California Street that runs between the Boston suburbs of Watertown and Newton and houses more than 15 small businesses . They are remarkably diverse , including everything from a law office to an Asian restaurant , an air-conditioning contractor to a nail spa . And with the exception of the Stop & Shop grocery store , which is bustling , and maybe one or two others , all of them have been hit by the state \u2019 s stay-at-home advisory and orders for \u201c non-essential \u201d businesses to close .\nSmall businesses are bone and sinew to the U.S. economy . They represent 99 % of all firms and employ about half of all working Americans . More than 40 % of the nation \u2019 s economic activity flows through their ledgers . While any firm with less than 500 workers can be considered \u201c small , \u201d nearly 9 in 10 of these firms have fewer than 20 employees . And with far fewer resources than big corporations , they \u2019 re also the most vulnerable to a downturn .\nAlready last month , when an employment report by payroll firm ADP showed midsize and large companies still adding employees , firms with fewer than 50 employees laid off a combined 90,000 workers . \u201c Small companies got hammered , \u201d says Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody \u2019 s Analytics .\nAnd they \u2019 re racing against the clock . The longer the lockdowns persist , the more likely they are to close permanently . A survey last week by the National Federation of Independent Business ( NFIB ) found that about half of small firms say they can survive for two months at the most .\nThe small businesses along California Street reflect the squeeze and the concern , but they also tell a richer story about how money flows and sometimes doesn \u2019 t , the fragile interdependence of local business , and the importance of human connections , even in an era of social distancing .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Edamame , an Asian restaurant in Watertown , Massachusetts , tried to stay open offering takeout and delivery . But by April 8 , 2020 , a note taped to the door told customers the eatery was closed until further notice .\nSome stores have been spared closure because they are essential businesses , like grocery stores . Planet Fitness , a workout gym , has shut its doors . But the Jenny Craig weight loss clinic two doors down is still open because it sells food . Still , staying open is no guarantee of profit .\nWhile the Jenny Craig store offers curbside service for limited hours and is seeing \u201c a steady flow of clients , \u201d according to Faith Hanson , marketing director of the north Boston area for the Jenny Craig corporation , American Dental next door is effectively closed , used only for emergency root canals .\n\u201c Everybody \u2019 s been affected , \u201d says Dr. Z. Bender , part of the management that operates this location and four others in the Boston area . Three of them are still open , but like many dentists in Massachusetts , Dr. Bender is only handling emergency situations and treatments that require immediate attention . He \u2019 s had to lay off roughly half of his 40 employees , while providing bonuses and protective equipment , including face shields , to those still working .\nRevenues are down 80 % or more , he estimates . So he \u2019 s looking to get referrals from other locations and do some promotion to boost business , because the current situation is not sustainable , he says . \u201c If we are going to keep operating this way , we would be able to continue for a few weeks . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a situation faced by many small businesses . Even before the COVID-19 pandemic , among the healthiest firms only 1 in 5 said they had the cash reserves to continue business as usual if revenue dried up for two months , according to a new survey of small business credit by the regional Federal Reserve banks . For all other firms , the figure was less than 1 in 10 .\nFor these reasons , Congress has rushed aid to small businesses . A week ago , firms began applying for $ 350 billion in forgivable small business loans , part of the $ 2 trillion coronavirus rescue package . Many of the businesses along California Street \u2013 as well as some 70 % nationally , according to the NFIB \u2013 have already applied .\nFor some , it \u2019 s not clear if the help will come in time . The owner of the Newton Nail Bar & Spa vows in an email to serve customers again soon . But after launching last year , the shop \u2019 s phone number no longer accepts calls and , aside from a \u201c Grand Opening \u201d banner still hanging in its window , there \u2019 s no sign telling clients the now-darkened store will reopen .\n\u201c I got a manicure a week before all this happened , \u201d says Debbie Fredberg , co-owner with her husband of the My Salon Suite just up the street . \u201c They put a lot of money into it . You can tell . At the time , they seemed upbeat . \u201d\nThis is one of the lessons of California Street : In business , timing can be everything . While Newton Nail Bar & Spa opened at the wrong time , Ms. Fredberg \u2019 s salon may get some breathing room from being still in the preparation phase . \u201c Coming Soon \u201d posters adorn its windows . Due to open this month , the site is now on hiatus ; construction stopped just as workers were beginning to move in the furniture .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a disappointment , \u201d she says , but hardly a big blow . Unlike a regular hair salon , the franchise rents out fully equipped individual rooms to stylists as well as massage therapists and beauticians . Getting one \u2019 s hair styled in a private room may be popular in a post-pandemic world , she adds . Some 80 % of the salon rooms are already spoken for .\nAnother lesson of California Street is that local business owners and workers tend to patronize each other , popping into the Stop & Shop for groceries , or eating at Edamame , the Asian restaurant behind it . Edamame tried to stay open offering takeout and delivery , stocking an outdoor rack of menus that got wet from the rain . But by Wednesday of this week , a note was taped to the door saying the restaurant was temporarily closed . Its customers \u2019 money , presumably , will flow down the block to Stop & Shop , or to other supermarkets .\nIn a normal year , Americans spend more on food eating out than they do at home . But the lockdowns in the past month have meant a huge diversion of spending from restaurants to grocery stores . The National Restaurant Association estimates the total at some $ 25 billion since March 1 , which has put 3 million people out of work . It figures 15 % of restaurants will close permanently within two weeks , if they haven \u2019 t already done so .\nOther money has stopped flowing at all , and that has a ripple effect . Closed offices mean the cleaning businesses have fewer to clean . Van drivers for the senior center and air-conditioning specialists are now laid off , which means they sit at home and spend less .\nSome small businesses appear to be doing just fine . \u201c We are busy and we are also running shorthanded , \u201d writes Arthur Margolis , president of ACC Apothecary , which specializes in custom-made prescriptions for patients . \u201c All I can say is that we are open and we have patients in 8 states that we are taking care of . \u201d\nNationally , 3 % of small businesses surveyed by the NFIB were positively affected by the virus . But 92 % were adversely affected , even if business owners are hesitant to talk about it .\n\u201c Clients are holding on to their money , \u201d says the owner of EnChem Engineering , a remediation specialist for hazardous-waste sites , who doesn \u2019 t give his name or take off his face mask . But \u201c we are able to keep going . \u201d\nThe other aspect of business here on California Street is how personal it is . For all the moves to physically distance people , they still make social connections . It \u2019 s the essence of business , exchange among individuals .\nBehind EnChem Engineering , Zdorovie Senior Services is closed down . All the employees have been laid off . Even if it was open , it \u2019 s unlikely that retirement homes would let their clients travel and congregate . \u201c But I regularly call them to check up , \u201d says a manager , who won \u2019 t give her name .\nThis month , EnChem and the other small-business tenants in the building received an unexpected surprise .
