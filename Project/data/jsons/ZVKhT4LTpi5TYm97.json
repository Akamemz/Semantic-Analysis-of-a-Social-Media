    "content": "Well , if you live in Deerfield , Illinois , a new law is going into effect on June 13 : a ban on so-called assault weapons , which carries a $ 1,000/day fine if current owners of AR-15s don \u2019 t remove them from the village limits . Of course , retired law enforcement is exempt . The city ordinance also bans high-capacity magazines ( via Chicago Tribune ) :\nThe Village Board of Trustees unanimously approved a ban on certain types of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines , amending a 2013 ordinance that regulated the storage of those items . The new ordinance prohibits the possession , sale and manufacturing of certain types of assault weapons and large capacity magazines within the village , according to the ordinance . One change from the law as it was originally discussed exempts retired police officers from the ban , according to Village Manager Kent Street . Violations carry a fine of between $ 250 and $ 1,000 per day , according to Matthew Rose , the village attorney . He said the fine is levied each day until there is compliance . [ \u2026 ] In the ordinance , the definition of an assault weapon includes , among others , semiautomatic rifles that have a fixed magazine with a capacity to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition ; shotguns with a revolving cylinder ; and semiautomatic pistols and rifles that can accept large-capacity magazines and possess one of a list of other features . Among the dozens of specific models cited are the AR-15 , AK-47 and Uzi , according to the ordinance .\nSo , it \u2019 s really a gun ban . In the ordinance , their definition of high capacity is \u201c any ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more then ten rounds. \u201d So , forget the definitions of what a so-called assault weapon is ; this is a gun ban . Expand that list to include most handguns , besides revolvers , 1911s , and some carry guns . This is what we \u2019 re talking about , folks . We know the anti-gun Left is saying we don \u2019 t want to ban guns or repeal the Second Amendment ; we just want common sense gun laws . Well , this is the end result , forcing law-abiding residents to either move , which isn \u2019 t an option for a lot of people , or turn their guns over .
