I find the change refreshing . Unsurprisingly , not everyone shares this reaction .\nAn interesting piece of real-world evidence comes from the example of the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque region of Spain . With eighty-five thousand worker-owners , it \u2019 s the largest worker cooperative in the world today . The average Spanish CEO makes 143 times the salary of the average Spanish worker . Even in a business environment where Mondragon has to compete with traditional hierarchical businesses that can lure skilled managers away with higher salaries , the maximum pay differential between the highest-paid executive and the lowest-paid worker allowed by Mondragon policy \u2014 set by the General Assembly , where all eighty-five thousand workers get a vote \u2014 is capped at a paltry six to one .\nTo see her point , take one of the most often cited indications of wealth inequality \u2014 that the average American CEO makes 265 times the salary of the average American worker . ( This is actually one of the more conservative estimates . An analysis released by former Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison puts the differential at a staggering 339 to 1 . ) Where nonsocialist progressives typically think that the proper solution to excessive inequality is redistributive taxation , socialists think the underlying issue is a matter of who gets to set pay scales in the first place .\nIn making this distinction , Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez was giving voice to an idea with deep roots in socialist thought \u2014 that the unequal distribution of wealth is just a symptom of the deeper problem of the unequal distribution of economic power .\nIn a Martin Luther King Jr Day discussion with Ta-Nehisi Coates , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued for a very different perspective . If Jeff Bezos \u201c wants to be a good person , \u201d she said , he should \u201c turn Amazon into a worker cooperative. \u201d She argued that our primary message to billionaires shouldn \u2019 t be that we want to redistribute their money . Instead , it should be that \u201c we want their power . \u201d\nThe combined sum might be a fraction of his net worth , and Bezos might have a history of standing in the way of political efforts to address some of the same problems he seeks to address with his charity . Even so , many would argue that his efforts are still praiseworthy .\nOn Monday morning , Jeff Bezos announced the creation of a new $ 10 billion environmental foundation , the Bezos Earth Fund . This is on top of the $ 2 billion he already committed to the Bezos Family Foundation to build preschools and fight homelessness .\nMichael S. Rozeff argues that since Amazon workers who \u201c made wage bargains with Amazon and didn \u2019 t form a cooperative \u201d were freely choosing the first course over the second one , if Bezos is a bad person for not restructuring Amazon as a worker cooperative , his employees share the blame .\nLiz Wolfe at Reason claims in her response to Ocasio-Cortez that a cooperative form of organization \u201c is unlikely to work for a company of Amazon \u2019 s size. \u201d She backs up this point by quoting an older article by John McLaughry that claims life in \u201c [ a ] n unstructured participatory workplace \u201d can lead to \u201c problems of severe emotional intensity. \u201d He mentions \u201c rage , tears , splitting headaches , and other real stress afflictions. \u201d McLaughry concedes that such experiments might work despite these problems in cases where \u201c everyone involved comes from a common cultural , ethnic , racial , or political background , \u201d but he says that \u201c success can be close to impossible \u201d when this is not the case .\nPutting Rozeff , Wolfe , and McLaughry \u2019 s points together , we get the following objections to converting Amazon into a worker cooperative :\nDespite the unviability of cooperatives , if Amazon \u2019 s workforce preferred a cooperative form , they would have formed a cooperative to compete with Amazon . Even if cooperatives are generally viable , Amazon is too big to function as one . Amazon workers are too diverse to handle democratic decision-making together . The transition to democracy in the workplace would be too stressful and upsetting for Amazon workers to handle .\nAn obvious problem with the first point is that it ignores considerable barriers to entry . Research on worker cooperatives shows that they \u2019 re at least as efficient as other firms . Once they get going , they do about as well and last about as long as regular capitalist businesses . The problem isn \u2019 t a higher death rate \u2014 it \u2019 s a considerably lower birth rate .\nThere are many reasons for this , but an obvious one is that it \u2019 s easier to attract investors for a new business if you can offer them ongoing ownership shares . That \u2019 s why Karl Marx praised worker cooperatives as \u201c great social experiments \u201d that provided a valuable proof of concept that it was possible for \u201c modern industrial production \u201d to take place without a division between \u201c a class of masters \u201d and \u201c a class of hands , \u201d but he said that actually transitioning to an economy based on workplace democracy would require political struggle .\nThe second objection makes sense \u2014 if we assume , as Wolfe and McLaughry seem to , that turning Amazon into a worker cooperative would mean \u201c unstructured \u201d participatory workplaces \u2014 endless mass meetings striving for consensus on every issue . But there \u2019 s no reason to assume this . Workers ( at individual fulfillment centers and throughout the company ) could elect a management structure in the way that they do at Mondragon .\nTo be sure , this isn \u2019 t a panacea . There are serious critiques of the Mondragon model that advocates of worker cooperatives would do well to grapple with \u2014 but the question isn \u2019 t whether working at Amazon would be a workplace utopia blissfully free of worker alienation and other problems if it were converted into a cooperative . The question is whether it would be better .\nThe best counter to the third objection is the real-world history of the labor movement , which has proven over and over again around the world that workers from diverse ethnic , cultural , and political backgrounds can work together in democratic organizations to decide what they want to be paid , how they want their workplaces to function , and so on . The only difference is that in a unionized workplace , the workers have to negotiate with a boss ( who has more bargaining power ) about how many of these plans come to fruition . In a cooperative workplace , the democratic decision of the workers or their elected representatives is the final say .\nAs to the fourth objection , it \u2019 s true that getting to make decisions for yourself can be stressful and upsetting . The question is whether this would be more or less stressful , upsetting , exhausting , and demoralizing than working in the rigidly hierarchical structure Jeff Bezos currently imposes on his workforce .\nRozeff might think that Amazon workers \u201c chose \u201d to work at the company rather than going into business for themselves , but the severe inequality in bargaining power between an ultra-wealthy corporation and its atomized \u201c associates \u201d means very few of their preferences are reflected in the company \u2019 s policies . A full 91 percent \u201c wouldn \u2019 t recommend working there , \u201d 89 percent described themselves as \u201c exploited , \u201d 71 percent \u201c reported walking more than 10 miles per day \u201d during their shifts at fulfillment centers , and 78 percent \u201c felt their breaks were too short . \u201d\nFormer Amazon \u201c associate \u201d Candice Dixon reported having to scan a new item once every eleven seconds to meet her quota . \u201c Amazon always knew \u201d if she didn \u2019 t . This nightmare of \u201c cutting-edge technology , unrelenting surveillance , and constant disciplinary write-ups \u201d led to Dixon destroying her back .\nToday , not only can she not work at the company , she can \u201c barely climb stairs. \u201d This experience isn \u2019 t unusual . The rate of serious injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers is more than twice the national average for the warehousing industry \u2014 \u201c 9.6 injuries per 100 full-time workers in 2018 , compared to an industry average that year of 4 . \u201d\nCongresswoman Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s proposal to convert Amazon into a cooperative might not solve all the problems of its workers in one fell swoop .
