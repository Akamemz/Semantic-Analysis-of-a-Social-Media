Four years later , we now know that they did .\nThe Washington Post returned to Wisconsin this past weekend to empty union halls and a depressed workforce . The public employee union law \u2013 which barred contract negotiations on everything but base wages and limited annual salary increases to the rate of inflation , forced most unions to collect their own dues rather than having them deducted automatically by the state and mandated annual recertification of affiliates \u2013 has been more successful than even its supporters hoped .\nIn the state where public employee unions got their start , public workers see no need to stay enrolled , since unions can not by law effectively advocate on their behalf . Membership in the Wisconsin affiliate of the National Education Association is down one-third ; the American Federation of Teachers dropped by one-half ; the state employees union fell 70 percent .\nThere are fewer public employees working , too , even though Gov . Walker claimed that the passage of the anti-union law would save jobs . The Wisconsin Budget Project finds that the ratio of public employees to total population is at its lowest level in at least two decades .\nOverall , union membership in Wisconsin has fallen to 11.7 percent , down from 16 percent 10 years ago , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , suggesting a spillover into the private sector labor force as well .
