    "content": "Strange , but in the final editing of my book , which is much concerned with the American conservative movement , I can not find a single mention of the \u201c alt-right. \u201d I don \u2019 t know what the alt-right is , or anyone in it . Perhaps it supplants the \u201c New Right \u201d \u2014 which was more aggressive than the \u201c Old Right \u201d ?\nI \u2019 ve never liked the term \u201c right \u201d ; it reinforces the mythology that conservatism is even remotely aligned with fascism and Nazism . Such regimes , in their expansive power , have more in common with the Big Government of so-called \u201c progressives. \u201d And nationalism is inconclusive ; FDR was no shrinking violet , and it was JFK who urged \u201c what you can do for your country . \u201d\nJake Turx is a correspondent for Brooklyn-based Ami Magazine . The orthodox Jewish reporter is one of many little-known journalists now permitted to participate in White House press briefings and news conferences . This is an affirmative action program hugely disfavored by the mainstream media . That \u2019 s because it \u2019 s real diversity .\nHere \u2019 s the background : Over last weekend vandals toppled headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Society cemetery in St. Louis . Recently there were reports of bomb threats to 48 Jewish centers . These reports prompted Mr. Turx ( pen name ) to ask President Donald Trump what Turx thought was a friendly softball question about the president addressing anti-Semitism .\nIn response , it would have been both desirable and appropriate , and expedient , for President Trump to condemn anti-Semitism and racial and religious hatred . He should have done so , then . Instead President Trump called the question \u201c repulsive \u201d and \u201c insulting \u201d ; but he might have added \u201c demeaning. \u201d ( A ) The president \u2019 s generic is not to reply to an attack , not yield even one inch to an unacceptable premise . ( B ) The president \u2019 s specific is that associating him in any way with anti-Semitism is outrageous . ( C ) The president saw the question premised on the political correctness of Jewish victimhood , and the thing Jews in the U.S. are victims of , is\u2026 political correctness .\nPresident Trump likely ( and incorrectly ) felt that responding properly would dignify the rap against him and his team and perhaps even be patronizing . He likely wanted to avoid a headline like \u201c Trump Denies Anti-Semitism \u201d or \u201c Trump Finally Condemns Hate. \u201d But his rhetorical diversion to the Electoral College convinced conspiracists the president had a sinister agenda . He supposedly did not want to disillusion his presumed anti-Semitic base .\n\u201c I am the least anti-Semitic person that you \u2019 ve ever seen in your entire life , \u201d President Trump responded . His inelegant syntax , Bill Buckley would say , enabled CNN talking heads to conclude , as they did , that if President Trump is the least , then he is somewhat anti-Semitic . That may not qualify as Fake News ; it is Fake Analysis .\nThe controversy has its roots in the relentless character assassination of candidate and now President Trump . First , there was the canard that he is an anti-Semite . That became implausible given , for example , his love for his daughter and his proximity to his son-in-law , both Orthodox Jews who raise Trump \u2019 s grandchildren in that rigorous observance . In much greater detail I explained this and more to a vitriolic Trump hater who happens to be Jewish ; he responded , \u201c But some Jews supported Hitler. \u201d There seems the inevitable comparison of Trump to Hitler , encouraged by CNN , which keeps replaying that neo-Nazi creep , who has almost no following , chanting \u201c Heil Trump . \u201d\nCandidate Trump might not hate Jews , Trump \u2019 s detractors said , but Trump \u2019 s campaign is full of \u201c dog whistles \u201d because his campaign ads were coded to appeal to anti-Semites . That became implausible since only the liberal Jewish complainers deciphered the code . In reality , the only \u201c dog whistle \u201d to the anti-Semites is each time President Trump appoints to a major position someone who happens to be Jewish .\nBut if you accept the premise that Trump and his team are evil , the explanation is always ominous , and that helps explain the reaction on January 27 , when the White House issued President Trump \u2019 s statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day . The statement inexplicably and inexcusably failed to mention the Jewish victims ; it was worse than insensitive . It sounded like Barack Obama ; had President Obama issued the same statement , I would have criticized it .\nTrump \u2019 s adversaries had a theory : Presidential Senior Counselor Steve Bannon is a historical revisionist . Allegedly Bannon aligned with the alt-right and its anti-Semites who want to minimize the extermination of Jews .\nIt turns out the author of the statement was Boris Epshteyn , an assistant to President Trump . Epshteyn was born in in 1982 in Moscow , then in the Soviet Union ; in 1993 he emigrated to the U.S . In 1979 , when I visited communist-ruled Leningrad ( St. Petersburg ) , the Red hosts insisted on a cemetery commemoration for the quarter of the city \u2019 s population killed by the Nazis . The communists played down the genocide of Jews . If you visited Auschwitz when the communists controlled Poland , the exhibit and tour guide alluded to the victims \u2014 Polish opponents of the Nazis , communists , gypsies , and , almost parenthetically , Jews ; in fact , Jews were overwhelmingly the carnage at what evolved from a concentration camp into a death camp . After Poland became free of communism , the Auschwitz exhibit and guides properly emphasized that Auschwitz was dedicated overwhelmingly to the annihilation of Jews . In other words , it was the communists \u2014 the Left \u2014 that minimized the Holocaust .\nPerhaps before 11-year-old Epshteyn emigrated to the U.S. , the Soviet education system had inculcated the party line \u2014 World War II , not the Holocaust . In any case , Boris Epshteyn is no anti-Semitic lackey . Like many Jews from the former Soviet Union , Epshteyn is proud of his Judaism and his political conservatism .\nFor leftists born into a Jewish family , anti-Semitism is not about people who hate Jews . It \u2019 s about people that the Jewish leftists hate , notably President Trump and , guilt by association , his advisers .\nRabbi Marvin Heir of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles prayed at the Trump swearing-in . A few days ago a reporter asked Heir about President Trump \u2019 s \u201c failure to condemn anti-Semitism. \u201d Rabbi Heir replied that the president would pick the time and place . And so it was yesterday , at the end of a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture , that President Trump said the venue showed \u201c why we have to fight bigotry , intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms . \u201d\nAbout reports of increased anti-Semitism , he said , \u201c The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil . \u201d\nAfter reporting this , CNN interviewed one Steven Goldstein , executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect . My question to him : Do you think Anne Frank was murdered because of a lack of \u201c mutual respect \u201d ?\nAsked on CNN if he was satisfied with Trump \u2019 s condemnation of anti-Semitism , Goldstein said absolutely not . To prove his good faith , Goldstein emphasized , Trump must fire Steve Bannon , supposedly ( and with no evidence ) an anti-Semite . Trump used to complain that in repudiating hatred and prejudice , he could never satisfy his critics . And Goldstein proved Trump correct .\nSo who is Steven Goldstein ? Like Boris Epshteyn , Goldstein lived in New Jersey ; both started in politics with former Sen. Frank Lautenberg . That \u2019 s where the resemblance ends . Goldstein epitomizes the Dark State of philanthropy , using tax-free dollars for political polemics . Goldstein \u2019 s Anne Frank Center \u201c is a progressive voice for social justice , fighting hatred of refugees and immigrants , anti-Semitism , sexism , racism , Islam phobia , homophobia , transphobia\u2026 \u201d Did Goldstein leave anything out ? Is the legacy of Anne Frank now reduced to this potpourri of political correctness ?\nSteven Goldstein reminds me of a variation of a current cartoon . A man says , \u201c Women and gays should have no rights . Jews are pigs. \u201d Goldstein , gay and Jewish , would likely reply , \u201c You must be one of those alt-right creeps behind Donald Trump ! \u201d The man might respond , \u201c No , actually these are my religious beliefs . I \u2019 m a devout Muslim. \u201d And Goldstein , who presumes to judge Trump and demands that Bannon be fired , would likely respond , \u201c I apologize . I hope you don \u2019 t think I \u2019 m Islamophobic ! \u201d",
