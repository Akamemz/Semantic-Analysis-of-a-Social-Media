That 's the highest level ever recorded on that question in NBC News/Wall Street Journal polling .\nBut the results of the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and a handful of other national polls released earlier this week also suggest that while neither side is faring well , more fingers are being pointed at Republicans than at Democrats and President Barack Obama .\n`` People do n't like the spectacle of the government shutting down and that 's what 's driving everybody 's numbers down , '' CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley , anchor of `` State of the Union , '' said .\nCNN Polling Director Keating Holland agreed : `` The bad news for both parties is that the shutdown is making the public feel worse about both sides .
