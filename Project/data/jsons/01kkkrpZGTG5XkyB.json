The temporary fee would kick in next year and is meant to raise $ 25 billion over three years , to help pay for the cost of people with pre-existing conditions signing up for coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges .\nThe proposal filed Monday would exempt certain self-insured plans -- those that do not use a third-party administrator for core functions -- for 2015 and 2016 .\nRepublicans charge this is aimed at unions ' so-called Taft-Hartley plans , though union officials had downplayed the change and suggested some of their plans would n't be eligible anyway .\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said earlier this month -- when the administration first telegraphed that it might craft the exemption -- that the change does not single out the union insurance policies , according to The Associated Press .\nA Health and Human Services official also disputed the claim that this is directed at unions .\n`` This definition would exempt any self-insured group health plan that does not use a third party administrator for claims processing or enrollment , not only union plans , '' the official told FoxNews.com , adding they are proposing the change to better `` align '' the definition with the law . `` The phrase 'self-insured , self-administered plans ' is not synonymous with multiemployer plans , or Taft-Hartley plans .
