    "content": "At an emergency hearing on Capitol Hill Thursday , Republicans repeatedly asked FBI Director James Comey about a \u201c double standard \u201d for Hillary Clinton in her handling of government emails on her private setup while secretary of State . How could Mrs. Clinton escape prosecution while \u201c the average Joe , \u201d as Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( R ) of Utah put it , would be \u201c in handcuffs \u201d for doing the same thing ?\nMr. Comey expressed understanding for such questions \u2013 raised by many Americans as well \u2013 but said his professional investigative team , which didn \u2019 t \u201c give a hoot about politics , \u201d had found no criminal intent to break the law . And only once in the last century has the Justice Department brought charges based on a lesser standard , gross negligence . That case was for espionage .\n\u201c There is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts , '' the director told the House oversight committee , which had hastily called the briefing just days before a seven-week congressional recess .\nOne of the main jobs of Congress is governmental oversight , but lawmakers have a very hard time controlling their partisan impulses , especially when one party controls Capitol Hill and another the White House , according to congressional observers . Standout , bipartisan investigations , such as the iconic Watergate hearings of 1973 , are actually few and far between , while hearings such as Thursday 's shed more heat than light , they say .\nMembers have brought this upon themselves , says former House historian Raymond Smock , coeditor of a two-volume history of congressional investigations . \u201c In the hyper-partisanship of recent years , \u2026 they \u2019 ve tied their own hands . They \u2019 ve made it impossible for them to do their own job . \u201d\nThe consequence is an automatic assumption of partisanship and inattention to other serious issues .\n\u201c When oversight gets political , Democrats and Republicans obsess about the food fight du jour and overlook real problems in the administration of government , \u201d says John Pitney , a congressional expert at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont , Calif .\nTake the waiting-time scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs , which came to light in 2014 , he says . It was building for years , affecting veterans all over the country . \u201c So where was congressional oversight ? \u201d\nThe hallmarks of effective oversight , say observers such as Mr. Pitney and Smock , are bipartisanship , thoroughness , and results \u2013 either recommendations to improve things or correction in the case of malfeasance .\nThey point to classic examples of congressional oversight that worked , either for their legwork or bipartisanship or both :\nTobacco hearings under former Rep. Henry Waxman ( D ) of California , the most memorable being in 1994 when tobacco executives each testified that they believed nicotine is not addictive . Mr. Waxman drove legislation that gave the government the power to regulate tobacco and strengthen warnings on cigarettes and advertising .\nThe Watergate hearings that eventually led to Republican President Nixon \u2019 s 1974 resignation . Potential presidential candidates were kept off the bipartisan , special Senate investigative committee to avoid the appearance that they were trying to advance their own chances at Nixon \u2019 s expense . It was a Republican staff member whose question revealed the secret Nixon tapes .\nThe \u201c Truman Committee , \u201d a special bipartisan panel headed by then-Sen. Harry Truman ( D ) of Missouri , formed to investigate abuse and waste in World War II war production . President Roosevelt was so impressed with the findings \u2013 critical of his own administration \u2013 that he chose Truman as his vice president .\nIn contrast , Thursday \u2019 s hearing featuring Comey was \u201c Kabuki theater , \u201d comments Pitney , with the political actors playing their predictable roles .\n\u201c This is one of those situations where the Republicans are going to answer it one way and the Democrats will answer it another , \u201d he says .\nRepublicans pushed Comey on questions of Clinton \u2019 s intent and whether she lied to the FBI , citing the contradiction between her public statements and the FBI \u2019 s findings .\nFor instance , she has stated that she never sent or received classified information over her email ( the FBI found 110 emails out of 30,000 that contained classified information , including Top Secret information ) , and that all work-related emails were returned to the State Department ( the FBI found thousands that were not returned ) .\nCongressman Chaffetz , chairman of the House oversight committee , asked flat-out whether Clinton lied to the FBI .
