    "content": "Mitch McConnell remembers Chuck Schumer \u2019 s role during his contentious 2008 campaign like it was yesterday .\nIn the home stretch of the election season , the Schumer-led Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee launched blistering TV ads accusing the Republican leader of inducing the economic meltdown with lax regulations and then bailing out Wall Street . McConnell was infuriated . He believed the attacks breached a pact by the two parties not to politicize the government rescue in the elections , something Democrats disputed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think any hatchet needed to be buried , \u201d McConnell said when asked in a recent interview whether he had made peace with Schumer . \u201c I won , he lost . \u201d\n\u201c They tried again last year . I won , they lost overwhelmingly , \u201d he added . \u201c I don \u2019 t get mad about it . I don \u2019 t own the seat . They want to have a contest , we have a contest . \u201d\nMcConnell , now the Senate majority leader , and Schumer , the Democratic leader-in-waiting , will now have to figure out how \u2014 and when \u2014 to drop their political swords . Despite serving 16 years together in the chamber , the two men have developed virtually no rapport in a body where trust and relationships are essential . To the extent they \u2019 ve engaged , it \u2019 s mainly been to launch political \u2014 and at times , personal \u2014 attacks .\nBut with Schumer set to replace Sen. Harry Reid as Democratic leader in the next Congress , the New York Democrat and the Kentucky Republican will soon have to work with each other on a daily basis \u2014 on issues as mundane as the Senate schedule and as profound as the country \u2019 s domestic and foreign policy . Their relationship could go a long way in deciding how much of the next president \u2019 s campaign agenda gets done , since neither party is likely to have a filibuster-proof majority .\n\u201c They both enjoy political mischief and are good at it , \u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , who is close to both men . \u201c But if they can keep the political mischief down to about 25 percent of what they do , I think they have a very good chance to be awfully good Senate leaders working together . \u201d\nBut the lack of affection between the two men is evident . Just last week each accused the other of causing the latest round of Senate gridlock . At the same time , they \u2019 re both relatively nonideological pragmatists who , when it comes down to it , want to make a deal . That bodes well for future productivity , fellow senators from both parties said .\n\u201c Schumer is kind of transactional and kind of a dealmaker and likes to , I think , get things done . Sen. McConnell obviously likes to get things done , \u201d said Sen. John Thune ( R-S.D . ) , the No . 3 in his party \u2019 s leadership . \u201c So if you can find the common ground , there may be the foundation of some success . \u201d\n\u201c I think he \u2019 ll be fine , \u201d Reid said of Schumer \u2019 s ability to work with McConnell . \u201c Chuck is somebody that certainly understands what \u2019 s going on around here ; he \u2019 s been included in things I \u2019 ve done for a number of years now . He \u2019 ll do very well . \u201d\nThe two men could hardly be more different in how they operate . The 64-year-old Schumer charges through the Senate , speaking loudly on his flip phone and keeping his finger on the pulse of a range of issues . He schmoozes with his colleagues at the Senate gym and rubs elbows with them over wine and cheese on the first floor of the chamber .\nThe 73-year-old McConnell is laconic , reserved and calculating . He rarely tips his hand on his next step and spends little time worrying whether his colleagues find him personally charming .\n\u201c Mitch can be implacable , and it \u2019 s going to be hard for anybody to change that , \u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-R.I. ) , who is close to Schumer . He added , \u201c I suppose if there \u2019 s a way , Chuck is the person most likely to find it . \u201d\nSchumer emerged as Reid \u2019 s heir apparent immediately after the Nevadan \u2019 s retirement announcement in March , yet Schumer and McConnell have yet to speak much since . McConnell still works primarily with Reid , and Schumer , who declined to be interviewed for this article , wants to avoid looking like he \u2019 s prematurely preparing to take over . Reid still has a year and a half in office .\nRepublicans have grown increasingly frustrated with Reid and are optimistic that the Senate will function better with Schumer as Democratic leader . But the New Yorker will face enormous challenges . At the top of the list : managing the needs of red-state Democrats , including several who \u2019 ll be up for reelection in states like North Dakota and Missouri , with an ascendant progressive wing led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren .\nThen there \u2019 s the touchy task of filling out his leadership team . Schumer has yet to make key decisions about his top lieutenants , including whether to push for the current Democratic whip , Dick Durbin of Illinois , to stay in that position . The two have had a tense relationship , but Durbin repeated in an interview that he has the votes to remain in the job .\nDurbin could , however , face a challenge from Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) , who has been close with Schumer . She \u2019 s avoided discussing her ambitions within the caucus since Reid \u2019 s announcement .\nWhile Durbin said Schumer \u2019 s deal-making skills during the 2013 immigration debate show he can work with Republicans , it \u2019 s an open question how he handles the wily McConnell .\n\u201c It remains to be seen , \u201d Durbin said . \u201c Each leader has his own chemistry . Same is obviously true for Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell . And we will see . \u201d\nFor many years , Reid and McConnell had a trusting relationship . Each had methodically risen through the ranks of his caucus , and each eventually served as his party \u2019 s whip before both became elected as leaders .\nBut in the past Congress , their relationship deteriorated , according to senators and aides . McConnell and Reid viewed each other as breaking the customs of an institution both revered . The ill will grew in 2013 , when Reid took the unprecedented step of changing filibuster rules to overcome GOP stalling tactics on presidential nominations . It became more contentious as the Democratic leader sought to defeat McConnell in his hard-fought reelection contest in 2014 .\nThings grew so frosty that McConnell and Reid would occasionally rely on emissaries to communicate . Schumer would speak with one of McConnell \u2019 s chief deputies , like Alexander or Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn , to trade intelligence .\n\u201c I think it would be a fresh start for that relationship , \u201d Cornyn said of Schumer and McConnell . \u201c Reid and McConnell , I think , have obviously had to deal with each other , and it \u2019 s been a challenging relationship . \u201d\nMcConnell \u2019 s aides say that the GOP leader doesn \u2019 t get hung up on personalities and is willing to work with just about anyone . Case in point : McConnell didn \u2019 t have much of a relationship with Joe Biden in the Senate , yet the senator and the vice president struck some of the most consequential fiscal deals during the Obama presidency .\nIn recent days , McConnell and Schumer have ratcheted up their barbs as action has stalled on a range of matters , from appropriations to defense spending . McConnell accused Democratic leaders of wanting to \u201c paint \u201d their offices and \u201c fatten \u201d the IRS instead of fund military equipment and give pay raises to troops .\n\u201c When Sen.
