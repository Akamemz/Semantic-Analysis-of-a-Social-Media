    "content": "As a college professor who meets with thousands of students nationwide , I regularly tell students that the bedrock of my own college experience almost 20 years ago was the meeting and mixing with students from around the world . My classes were generally unremarkable , but what made the collegiate bubble so exceptional were the early Saturday morning tailgates , midnight runs for donuts with close friends , or long hikes exploring areas around San Francisco . The discussions that I had in the dorms and the dining halls over my four years changed my thinking and my life , and today my friends are doing incredible things from serving in the halls of Congress , to representing the nation at the Olympics , to becoming incredible parents and agents of change who all continue to enrich my life . These are the moments where I really learned about life and I still cherish them decades later .\nNow that I \u2019 m a teacher with my own students , I keep those days in mind . While I love my seminars , the memories that linger are those where we spend time outside of the classroom . Just this winter before we all scattered , a group of my students and I met in New York City to attend a strange panel about polarization and the internet , and we ended up bonding over dim sum for hours afterward . I have so many more stories like this and these experiences make up the real secret of the residential college experience which can not be done over Zoom ; I have certainly tried . The best teachers and technologies can not be substitutes for late night debates and discussion , and our nation \u2019 s students know this .\nMeanwhile , countless school presidents have made public statements where they insist on reopening in some form with impractical distancing measures or hope to go virtual . On the one hand , it \u2019 s understandable . The Covidian era has placed hundreds if not thousands of our nation \u2019 s colleges and universities , like my own , under existential threat .

What if they simply don \u2019 t show up ?\nPresidents and trustees are deluding themselves into thinking that students will return in mass or are willing to pay the remarkably high-tuitions that have become a hallmark of our secondary educational system , especially given the deep financial contraction that has impacted almost everyone . Many colleges are not discounting tuition and students are cost sensitive to the point that almost 40 percent of students regularly opt to skip their first-choice college because of cost-related reasons .\nRelatedly , students may not be willing to pay sky high prices for an experience that is based on being able to engage in real , tangible space .\nSurvey data confirms this observation . While students certainly appreciate rankings , data from the Higher Education Research Institute \u2019 s Freshman Survey for 2018 shows that 53 percent of first years stated that their school \u2019 s social and extracurricular activities were very important in helping make their decision to attend . Of the other 18 factors asked , the only responses that were ranked higher were academic reputation ( 68 percent ) and \u201c this college \u2019 s graduates get good jobs \u201d ( 59 percent ) . \u201d Jobs and social experiences were within a handful of points of each other , suggesting that students really care about the experience factor while only 19 percent of the students said that \u201c rankings \u201d were very important in making their choice .\nGoing further , even if one accepts the branding argument that elite schools may continue to thrive while many second-tier and third tier schools fade out of business because of the pandemic , students at elite schools remain unhappy at the prospect of virtual education .
