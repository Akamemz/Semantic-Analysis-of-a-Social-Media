    "content": "Newly impeached President Trump said Democrats were on a \u201c suicide march \u201d with their historic vote Wednesday night , as his campaign team planned to make Democrats pay at the polls in 2020 .\nAddressing supporters at a campaign rally in Battle Creek , Michigan , while the House was impeaching him back in Washington , Mr. Trump served notice that his status as an impeached president running for reelection will haunt his Democratic opponents at the ballot box .\n\u201c This lawless , partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democratic Party , \u201d Mr. Trump declared , noting his rise in approval ratings . \u201c Have you seen my polls in the last four weeks ? \u201d\nClearly enthused by the crowd \u2019 s support , Mr. Trump also told his audience , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t really feel like we \u2019 re being impeached . \u201d\nShortly after the House voted to impeach a president for only the third time in history , a campaign aide brought a sign to the front of the stage to show Mr. Trump the vote totals while he was in the midst of his speech .\n\u201c Every single Republican voted for us , \u201d Mr. Trump said , reacting to his impeachment in real time . \u201c So we had 198 . \u2026 We didn \u2019 t lose one Republican vote . Every single Republican voted for us ? Wow . We didn \u2019 t lose one Republican vote . We have a great Republican Party . We have to take back the House . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c The Democrats always stick together Think of it : Three Democrats went over to our side . That \u2019 s unheard of . \u201d\nThe campaign rally , long scheduled , capped a dramatic day of split-screen television coverage with a buoyant Mr. Trump reveling with his supporters in a 2020 battleground state as the House Democrats pushed through two articles of impeachment on party-line votes . The vote sets up a trial next month in the Republican-led Senate , where Mr. Trump \u2019 s acquittal is virtually assured .\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the impeachment \u201c the culmination in the House of one of the most shameful political episodes in the history of our nation . \u201d\n\u201c The president is confident the Senate will restore regular order , fairness , and due process , all of which were ignored in the House proceedings , \u201d she said . \u201c He is prepared for the next steps and confident that he will be fully exonerated . \u201d\nShortly before the House rebuked the president over his dealings with Ukraine , Mr. Trump told the packed Michigan arena of about 6,000 people that \u201c the country is doing better than ever before . \u201d\n\u201c We did nothing wrong , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c And we have tremendous support in the Republican Party . This sacred season , our country is thriving . \u201d\nThe president said he \u2019 s not bothered personally by his impeachment , but added , \u201c What they put my family through is a disgrace . They ought to be ashamed . We should get apologies all over the place . \u201d\nPointing to what he called unfairly partisan impeachment standards , Mr. Trump also said Republicans should have impeached President Barack Obama for some of the scandals during his presidency , including the IRS targeting conservative groups and the \u201c Fast and Furious \u201d gun-running operation in the Justice Department .\n\u201c Why didn \u2019 t the Republicans impeach him ? \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c How about giving Iran $ 1.8 billion in cash ? Did anybody try to impeach him for that ? Everybody knew it was wrong . \u201d\nMr. Trump singled out two Democrats who voted against him , Reps. Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Carolyn Maloney of New York .\n\u201c Debbie Dingell , that \u2019 s a real beauty , \u201d he said of the lawmaker , noting he was watching her on TV during impeachment proceedings . He said he gave her family all possible considerations \u2014 \u201c the A-treatment \u201d \u2014 after her husband , Rep. John Dingell , died .\nShe told him in an emotional call that Mr. Dingell was \u201c thrilled \u201d looking down from heaven .\n\u201c Maybe he \u2019 s looking up , \u201d Mr. Trump said , drawing some moans from the crowd .\nHe also said he gave campaign donations to Mrs. Maloney years ago when he was a real estate developer and joked of her impeachment vote against him , \u201c Give me my damn money back . \u201d\nSome of Mr. Trump \u2019 s 6,000 supporters in Battle Creek waited overnight in freezing temperatures to see him on the momentous day . The event was billed as a \u201c Merry Christmas rally , \u201d featuring two Christmas trees on stage topped with red Make America Great Again hats .\nMindful of the need to win Michigan again next year , Mr. Trump spoke of a resurgent auto industry under his leadership . Ford has announced it will spend $ 1.5 billion in two auto factories in Michigan to create thousands of new jobs ; Fiat Chrysler announced a $ 4.5 billion investment in Michigan , including a new auto plant ; and GM announced a $ 300 million at its Orion assembly plant .\n\u201c You \u2019 re back , I \u2019 m very proud of you . I said I was going to bring car companies back . These companies are coming in . \u201d\nThe president began his day in Washington by asking the nation to pray .\n\u201c Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left , Do Nothing Democrats , AND I DID NOTHING WRONG ! \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted at 7:34 a.m. \u201c A terrible Thing . Read the Transcripts . This should never happen to another President again . Say a PRAYER ! \u201d\nThe Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee say impeachment is already backfiring on Democrats , spurring donations to the GOP , generating more Trump campaign volunteers and swaying independent voters in battleground states to support the president .\n\u201c They look like a bunch of fools , \u201d Mr. Trump said of the Democrats , led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . \u201c They \u2019 ll receive a big backlash at the [ ballot box ] . We want to take back the House , we \u2019 ll hold the Senate , and we \u2019 ll keep the White House . \u201d\nCalling the impeachment effort a \u201c phony , dangerous charade , \u201d he added , \u201c It \u2019 s all going to end soon , and it \u2019 s going to come out to a beautiful , great victory for the Republican Party and for this nation . \u201d\n\u201c I know one thing \u2014 Americans will show up by the tens of millions next year to vote Pelosi the hell out of office , \u201d he said .\nThe Trump campaign will push online fundraising based on impeachment , officials say . In the past week , the Trump campaign and the RNC have raised a combined $ 10 million in small-dollar donations since the House Judiciary Committee passed its two articles of impeachment .\nWhite House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway referred to an Axios report that said the RNC has gained 600,000 new donors since the start of impeachment , saying \u201c God bless them , they couldn \u2019 t stay on the sidelines anymore . They \u2019 re putting their money where their frustration is . \u201d\nThroughout the day on social media , the Trump campaign \u2019 s rapid-response team called out 30 House Democrats in pro-Trump districts for putting party over country . Those lawmakers also have been the target of a $ 10-million-plus advertising campaign by Trump allies urging them to vote no on impeachment .\nThe campaign is also targeting Democratic leaders such as Mrs. Pelosi , House Judiciary Committee Jerrold L. Nadler of New York and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff of California with real-time fact-checking online during the impeachment debate in the House .\nIn one tweet , the campaign \u2019 s \u201c Trump War Room \u201d account showed a video clip of Mr. Nadler arguing on the House floor against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 .\n\u201c # OnThisDay in 1998 , @ RepJerryNadler said \u2018 we have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the American people. \u2019 What changed ? \u201d the campaign tweeted .\nCampaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine ahead of the impeachment vote said , \u201c Democrats are preparing to make the biggest mistake in American history because they can \u2019 t get past their blind hatred of President Trump . \u201d\n\u201c Team Trump will hold Democrats accountable for every lie they make today and voters will hold them accountable in November 2020 , \u201d she said .\nShe said events on Wednesday offer \u201c a clear contrast \u2014 Dems in the swamp on one side overturning the 2016 election and the other side President Trump is rallying freedom-loving Americans who gather today to celebrate the greatness of our country . \u201d\nAs the House impeachment debate dragged on Wednesday , the mood at the White House was a mixture of disgust at Democrats and an air of inevitability . White House staffers said they were treating the day like any other , working for the nation and the president \u2019 s agenda .\n\u201c Is it frustrating ? Sure , \u201d said one White House aide . \u201c But as my dad texted me this morning , they [ Democrats ] have been trying to do this for three years . \u201d\nMs. Grisham said Mr. Trump was briefed on the debate throughout the day , and that he likely caught some of the televised coverage \u201c between meetings . \u201d\nIn the late afternoon , the president greeted supporters and dodged the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One to start his trip to Michigan .\nMrs. Conway , who met with a group of Republican senators at the Capitol on Wednesday to discuss the looming impeachment trial , said Mr. Trump \u2019 s mood was \u201c fine . \u201d\n\u201c His mood is good , \u201d she told reporters . \u201c It hasn \u2019 t stopped the president at all . \u201d\nBut she added , \u201c he doesn \u2019 t understand how we got here and why this is happening . \u201d\nMrs. Conway said of her colleagues in the White House , \u201c we all feel pretty disgusted by what happened in the House . \u201d\nShe said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone will defend Mr. Trump in the Senate trial next month , adding \u201c we are still finalizing that team. \u201d Mrs. Conway said she spoke with GOP senators about impeachment \u201c strategy , messaging , public opinion , precedent . \u201d\nA new Gallup poll released Wednesday showed that opposition to impeachment has risen to 51 % and that Mr. Trump \u2019 s job-approval rating has climbed 6 percentage points since the impeachment inquiry began .\nMrs. Conway also shared with the senators media clippings about Hunter Biden , son of Democratic front-runner Joseph R. Biden , who held a lucrative job with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father was serving as vice president . Mrs. Conway suggested the media coverage about Hunter Biden will serve as a defense for the president , who had asked Ukraine \u2019 s president to investigate possible corruption involving the Bidens .\n\u201c When the president says \u2018 people were talking about Biden and his son , \u2019 you bet they were , \u201d she said . \u201c Burisma was known , nakedly and openly , as one of the most corrupt [ companies ] .
