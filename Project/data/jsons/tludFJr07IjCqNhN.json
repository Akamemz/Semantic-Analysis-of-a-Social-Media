    "title": "Senators Set to Unveil Immigration Bill",
    "date": "2013-04-17",
    "authors": "Julia Preston",
    "content": "For the first time , the legislation would create a merit-based program to award the visa for legal permanent residents , known as a green card , based on a point system . When the merit system takes effect , five years after the bill is passed , at least 120,000 foreign-born people each year would be able to gain green cards by accumulating points based on their skills and education , as well as their family ties and the time they have lived in the United States .\nOver a decade , the balance in the immigration system would gradually shift away from the 75 percent of visas that now go to family members of immigrants already here . As a result of the merit program , closer to 50 percent of visas annually would go to immigrants based on their family ties , while about half would be based on job skills .\nAs part of the border security triggers , the bill would require all employers , within five years , to verify the legal status of new hires using a federal photo-matching system . It would also require the federal government to create an electronic system within 10 years for checking foreigners as they leave the country through airports and seaports .\nThe bill also would also create two new guest-worker programs , one for farmworkers and another for low-wage laborers .\nIt would give employers in technology and science fields tens of thousands of new temporary and permanent resident visas annually , which they have been urgently seeking for computer engineers and foreign graduates with advanced degrees from American universities . It raises current annual caps on temporary high-skilled visas , known as H-1B , to 110,000 from 65,000 , while adding 5,000 more of those visas for the foreign graduates . The cap would gradually rise to 180,000 .\nAnd the bill would allow young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children , known as Dreamers , to become citizens after only five years .\nThe senators are gambling that the bill would repair enough longstanding problems to attract support from a broad array of groups that would benefit , including Latinos , religious groups and labor unions ; big technology companies like Microsoft and Facebook , which have been clamoring for more visas ; agricultural growers and other employers in labor-intensive businesses ; and immigrant families who stand to be united more quickly with family members coming here legally .",
