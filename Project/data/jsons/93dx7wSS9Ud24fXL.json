    "content": "In the wake of the worst terrorist attack in America since 9/11 , President Obama could have used his Oval Office address on Sunday night to announce different policies than the ones that have obviously failed to keep America safe from radical Islam .\nHe could have explained why a long-feared arrival of low-tech , soft-target terrorism had occurred , and what he would do to rectify the problem\u2014beginning with apologizing for giving a U.S. visa to a jihadist from Pakistan and agreeing to stop his plan to bring more Syrian refugees here .\nHe could have announced a plan to undermine the ideology of our enemies\u2014radical Islam\u2014which impelled Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik to wage war in San Bernardino last week .\nInstead he did what he always does with security threats : blame others for his administration \u2019 s lapses and do the minimum to appear to be reacting to them without actually doing anything .\nThe president instinctively wants to react to every security threat by assailing his domestic opponents .\nIn calling for Congress to ban those on the no-fly list from buying guns , Obama is attempting one of his trademark shifts in blame for problems he has created . The president instinctively wants to react to every security threat by assailing his domestic opponents .\nEven if his proposed ban and other gun control measures were in place , they would not have stopped the attack in San Bernardino . Recent attacks like those in Paris show that jihadists have little problem overcoming gun laws , which serve mainly to disarm the law-abiding . Obama could also look to his adopted hometown of Chicago to see that gun control doesn \u2019 t work .\nObama \u2019 s moralizing about avoiding \u201c suspicion and hate \u201d implied , once again , that Americans are bigoted \u2014 another attempt to shift blame . It echoed a statement last week by Attorney General Loretta Lynch that the government would prosecute anti-Muslim speech that \u201c edges toward violence , \u201d whatever that means .\nThus did our government reveal its contempt for us and our Constitution in the wake of an attack it failed to prevent .\nObama \u2019 s reassurances about the fight against ISIS fell flat . In effect , a ragtag army of about 20,000 men have stood up to a year and a half of a U.S.-led war and prevailed\u2014all the while expanding their influence around the globe . Their success has inspired attacks like the ones in Paris and San Bernardino .\nCalling for Congress to approve retroactively his anti-ISIS campaign , as he did again in his Sunday evening prime time address , will do nothing to improve the flagging effort .
