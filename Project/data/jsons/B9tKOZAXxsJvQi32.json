    "content": "Comedian Michelle Wolf 's biting routine at Saturday 's 2018 White House Correspondents ' Association dinner has triggered one of Washington 's most recurring conversations : Is one night of pomp and politics worth the headaches that usually follow ?\nAlmost immediately after Wolf , best known as a correspondent on \u201c The Daily Show with Trevor Noah , '' left the stage at the Washington Hilton , those who pack into the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room on a daily basis began to distance themselves from her performance . A number of journalists deemed her act too caustic .\n`` The spirit of the event had always been jokes that singe but don \u2019 t burn . Reporters who work with her daily appreciate that @ presssec was there , '' NBC News White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell wrote on Twitter .\nAs consternation over Wolf 's jokes continued , White House Correspondents ' Association president Margaret Talev said the comedian 's monologue `` was not in the spirit of that mission , '' on a night when the association wanted promote a unifying message .\n`` Last night 's program was meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press while honoring civility , great reporting and scholarship winners , not to divide people , '' Talev said in a statement to the White House press corps .\nThe outgoing president of the WHCA , Talev said the organization is committing to hearing from members about format of the dinner going forward .\nPresident Donald Trump said Sunday evening that the dinner `` a total embarrassment to everyone associated with it '' and that it is time to change the format or kill it entirely . For the second straight year , the president skipped the gathering instead holding a campaign-style rally , this time in Michigan .\n`` The White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner was a failure last year , but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it , '' the president tweeted . `` The filthy \u201c comedian \u201d totally bombed ( couldn \u2019 t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance ) . Put Dinner to rest , or start over ! ''\nAt its core , the dinner is supposed to be a celebration of the First Amendment , an opportunity to laud the young journalists who have won the association 's scholarships , and a place to applaud the current journalists whose work illuminates the public 's understanding of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave .\n\u201c My goal in putting together last night 's dinner was to unify the room and the country around journalism and the First Amendment , and I shared what I believe about those subjects in my own remarks , \u201d Talev , a Bloomberg correspondent and president of the association , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier .\n\u201c The association , by tradition , does not preview or censor the entertainer 's remarks , \u201d Talev continued . \u201c Some of them made me uncomfortable and did not embody the spirit of the night . And that is protected by the First Amendment . I appreciated Sarah Sanders for joining us at the head table and her grace through the program . \u201d\nA persistent criticism of the glitzy dinner is that it fuels perceptions of excessive chumminess between members of the press and the government officials they \u2019 re expected to hold accountable , a rationale that prompted The New York Times to back out more than a decade ago . But some journalists feared that Saturday \u2019 s dinner could lead to a different perception , of being seen as the opposition to the president .\n\u201c If the # WHCD dinner did anything tonight , it made the chasm between journalists and those who do n't trust us , even wider , \u201d tweeted Meg Kinnard , a South Carolina-based reporter for The Associated Press . \u201c And those of us based in the red states who work hard every day to prove our objectivity will have to deal with it . \u201d\nNew York Times White House reporter Peter Baker concluded on Twitter after the event , \u201c Unfortunately , I do n't think we advanced the cause of journalism tonight. \u201d And Baker suggested in a reply to comedian Kathy Griffin that he \u2019 d \u201c vote to leave the comedy acts to comedy shows and stick to journalism at journalism dinners . \u201d\n`` First Amendment would probably be OK without the dinner , '' CNBC 's John Harwood added .\nAmid the backlash , some of Wolf 's fellow comedians came to her defense , praising the boldness of her approach .\n`` Few people go to DC and accomplish what they set out to do while staying true to themselves , '' Meyers , the 2011 dinner host , wrote on Twitter . `` @ michelleisawolf is one of those people . ''\nIf Washington ca n't take a joke , ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel added , it should look elsewhere for future entertainment .\n`` Dear `` the media '' - @ michelleisawolf was FUNNY , '' Kimmel , the 2012 host , wrote on Twitter . `` Hire a juggler next year . ''\nIn 2006 , \u201c Colbert Report \u201d host Stephen Colbert stayed in character as he scorched President George W. Bush and his administration ( along with the press for its coverage during the run-up to the Iraq War ) . Years later , Colbert said people still ask him what Bush , who was seated just steps away , told him after the routine .\nIn 2016 , comedian Larry Wilmore ended his jokes by saluting President Barack Obama , who was attending his final WHCD in office , with `` Yo , Barry , you did it , my n -- -a .
