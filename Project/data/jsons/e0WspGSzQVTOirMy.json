But he didn \u2019 t hide from the press\u2014I remember being on a late-night campaign flight where he talked and talked to a group of reporters , some of whom just wanted to catch some shut-eye but were afraid of missing something .\nJohn McCain spent eight or nine hours a day fielding questions from journalists on his bus in 2000 , to the point where we sometimes ran out of material and wound up talking about movies and sports .\nThat same year , George W. Bush , in his compassionate conservative phase , enjoyed chatting with his media regulars and bestowed nicknames on many of them .\nMitt Romney , by contrast , avoided his press corps , seemed uncomfortable around reporters , and ran a campaign that often ignored journalistic questions . That was a missed opportunity for a challenger .\nLook for Christie , assuming he runs in 2016 , to passionately engage with the media ( as you might have guessed when he did four Sunday shows after winning reelection ) . That engagement will sometimes be contentious , but chances are it will never be dull .\nThe best way to get a sense of how Christie \u2019 s approach to the media is to examine how he deals with New Jersey reporters . Matt Katz , who now covers the governor for WNYC and New Jersey Public Radio , lifts the curtain for Politico :\n\u201c The local reporters get our own unique treatment\u2014revealing , off-the-record , end-of-summer beers at Jersey Shore bars and profanity-infused Christmas party conversations at the governor \u2019 s mansion . But we also get our own unique abuse : We know what it \u2019 s like to be put in the \u2018 penalty box , \u2019 as Christie calls it , briefly shut out from the inner circle for writing something Team Christie hates . And we \u2019 ve all been dressed down in State House hallways by Christie \u2019 s chief spokesman , Michael Drewniak , an expert at channeling his boss \u2019 s fury .\n\u201c Christie likes to tell crowds at press conferences that I must have pissed someone off at the Philadelphia Inquirer to get the Christie beat , but he \u2019 s lying . He knows he fulfilled his promise from that first day we met : \u2018 We \u2019 re going to do our best to keep you entertained . \u2019 \u201d\nIn diary form , Katz recalls what Christie said at the 2011 presser when he announced he wouldn \u2019 t be running for president :\n\u201c The only regret I have is that I \u2019 ve given such great TV exposure to some of the local reporters . I mean , who \u2019 s gon na have Katz on TV now that I \u2019 m out of this race ? Nobody is gon na have Katz on TV . He won \u2019 t be able to get on News 12 for God \u2019 s sake . \u201d\nA savvy pol plays off his press corps , and Christie is no exception :\n\u201c Christie uses reporters the same way comedians use those in the front rows at stand-up shows . The back-and-forth amuses him , amuses his staff , amuses us ( sometimes ) . We also act as his foil , tossing the alley-oops for the sound bites that land on the gubernatorial YouTube channel .
