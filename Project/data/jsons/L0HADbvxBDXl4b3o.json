    "content": "Since the onset of the pandemic , there has been a lot of confusion regarding face masks .\nAt first , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the general public not to wear masks if they aren \u2019 t experiencing coronavirus symptoms or caring for someone with coronavirus . Then the agency reversed its guidance in early April and advised Americans to wear non-N-95 masks or face cloth covering in places where it is difficult to social distance .\nFollowing the CDC \u2019 s announcement , several states including New York adapted mandatory mask mandates . One study estimated that states that issued mandates between April and mid-May averted as many as 230,000 coronavirus cases .\nOthers left it up to cities or counties to issue mandates . But amid a resurgence of coronavirus , states like California and Texas issued state mandates in late June and early July , respectively .\nA separate study estimates that nearly 45,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus could be prevented by November if 95 % of the population wore masks .\nThe general consensus among infectious disease experts is that it will slow the spread and prevent some transmission . But many have disregarded health-experts \u2019 recommendations based on scientific evidence and refuse to wear a mask despite city- and state-wide mandates .\nSee also : Why do so many Americans refuse to wear face masks ? Politics is part of it \u2014 but only part\nSome see it as an infringement of personal freedom , while others may not wear masks because of misconceptions which have been shared widely on social media , said Peter Chin-Hong , an infectious disease physician at University of California San Francisco .\n1 . You don \u2019 t need to wear a mask outside since sunlight kills the virus\nA study published last month estimated that \u201c 90 % or more of SARS-CoV-2 virus will be inactivated \u201d after being exposed to midday sunlight for around 34 minutes .\nThat \u2019 s led some to believe that it is not necessary to wear a mask while outside .\n\u201c \u2018 We have enough compelling data to show that plenty of people get it outside if they \u2019 re close together without a mask \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Peter Chin-Hong , an infectious disease physician at University of California San Francisco\nBut the catch is the study is only applicable to surfaces . Meaning sunlight won \u2019 t stop someone from spreading the virus if they cough or sneeze near you while you \u2019 re outside , Chin-Hong said . \u201c COVID likes people more than sunlight . It cares more about mouths and noses being near each other . \u201d\n\u201c Overall this is a laboratory technical phenomenon that doesn \u2019 t translate into human transmission . We have enough compelling data to show that plenty of people get it outside if they \u2019 re close together without a mask .\n2 . You only need to wear a mask if you \u2019 re experiencing symptoms\nAsymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission accounts for more than half of the cases of coronavirus , according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a peer-reviewed journal on Monday .\nIn the absence of common symptoms of coronavirus , a person who has the virus may not be prompted to get tested and hence they don \u2019 t self-isolate .\n\u201c \u2018 We can say very clearly that wearing a mask is definitely helpful in preventing acquisition as well as transmission. \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\nThere is scant data on the percentage of cases of coronavirus that were prevented from wearing a mask , Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told lawmakers during his June 23 Congressional testimony .\n\u201c We can say very clearly that wearing a mask is definitely helpful in preventing acquisition as well as transmission , \u201d he said .\n\u201c It is always better to have a mask on than to not have a mask on , both for acquisition and for transmission , \u201d Fauci added .\n3 . Masks won \u2019 t offer any protection for the person wearing one\nThis is a more complicated one , rooted in truth . The rationale for wearing a mask in the midst of the pandemic is that it will act as a barrier to prevent respiratory droplets from the mouth and nose from dispersing and transmitting the virus to others . That \u2019 s considered to be the main way the virus spreads .\nBut isn \u2019 t true 100 % that the mask-wearer themselves doesn \u2019 t receive any protection from it , Chin-Hong said . \u201c You will get some amount of protection from wearing a mask because it \u2019 s just like plexiglass . It will block droplets from hitting your nose or mouth . \u201d\n4 . Wearing a mask will reduce your oxygen levels , right ?\nWrong . On Facebook FB , -2.47 % , one widely shared post in May claimed that wearing a mask will lower your oxygen levels . ( The post has since been taken down by Facebook . The company did not immediately respond multiple requests for a comment . )\n\u201c In cases where people have low oxygen levels to begin with that wearing a face mask won \u2019 t lower their oxygen \u201d\nAnother video making the same claim remains on Facebook but has been flagged for containing false information . In the video , the user , who is a firefighter according to factcheck.org , uses a multi-gas detector to test the levels of oxygen in he breaths in his mask . After a couple of seconds of wearing a mask , he shows that the oxygen in the air he \u2019 s breathing is lower .\n( The user who uploaded the video did not immediately respond to a request for comment . )\nNot only is the claim he \u2019 s making wrong but he also performed a flawed test to arrive at that conclusion , Chin-Hong told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c These are distractors , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s dangerous to bring these thoughts to the public when this public-health intervention can save lives . \u201d\nEven before coronavirus , face masks were given to patients who have lung diseases to protect others from them , he said . And in cases where people have low oxygen levels to begin with that wearing a face mask won \u2019 t lower their oxygen levels .\n5 . Anything other than an N-95 mask is useless in terms of limiting transmission of the virus\n\u201c The \u2018 Tesla TSLA , -3.08 % of masks \u2019 are N-95 masks , \u201d Chin-Hong said , that \u2019 s why they \u2019 re reserved for frontline medical workers who are caring for patients who have contracted coronavirus .\nThat said , a cloth mask , bandana or scarf is \u201c better than not being protected at all. \u201d Importantly , they provide a barrier to the respiratory droplets that could come in contact with the wearer , he added .\nAlthough several studies have attempted to uncover materials that offer the greatest level of protection for a homemade mask , \u201c it \u2019 s more important how comfortable you are when you wear it . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 re like trying on a pair of jeans , \u201d he said . Even if your mask is made from a thin material , which studies have shown offer less protection than a thicker material , if you \u2019 re comfortable while wearing it you \u2019 re less likely to touch your face to make adjustments .\nBottom line : \u201c People are using all kinds of excuses not to wear a mask like saying nothing works . If you have high cholesterol I \u2019 m not saying you won \u2019 t get a heart attack if you take medication , it \u2019 s all about risk reduction , \u201d Chin-Hong said .",
