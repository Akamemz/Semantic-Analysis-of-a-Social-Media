Photo taken February 6 , 2018 . \u2588\u2588\u2588/Lisa Maria Garza\nMore than 200 companies , including Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) , American Airlines Group Inc ( AAL.O ) and AT & T Inc ( T.N ) , are giving bonuses to at least 3 million U.S. workers , according to the conservative Americans for Tax Reform group .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 has interviewed people around the country on the benefits they have received so far . While they welcome the additional income , the cuts have largely not changed individuals \u2019 longstanding views on Trump or the two major political parties .\nWorking two jobs to make ends meet , 61-year-old Tim Smith was happy to get a $ 400 bonus as a part-time worker at Home Depot thanks to the U.S. tax overhaul , but his dislike for Trump and his policies remains .\n\u201c What can I do with that ? Not a lot . Buy some groceries , maybe pay a bill or two . That \u2019 s it , \u201d said Smith , as he deposited materials for recycling at the Home Depot where he works . He figured that after taxes , the bonus netted him $ 280 .\nHome Depot last month announced it would give its hourly workers a bonus of up to $ 1,000 as a result of Trump \u2019 s tax plan .\n\u201c I did benefit , yes , but , I believe , in seven years , anything we get is going to disappear , \u201d said Smith , adding he believed the tax plan was a \u201c rip-off \u201d that would help the wealthy and add $ 1 trillion to the national debt .\nSmith , who sports a long pony tail , lives with his wife in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Oakland Park , where he owns a home . Their two children are off to college .\nHe says the middle-class will eventually pay for the tax breaks , in cuts to programs such as Medicaid , Medicare and Social Security .\n\u201c That money \u2019 s got to come from somewhere , and it \u2019 s going to wind up coming from the middle-class , \u201d said Smith , who made about $ 55,000 in 2017 from the two jobs he works .\nA graduate of the University of Rhode Island with a degree in history and political science , Smith said he moved to Florida in 1991 and took any job he could .\nHe has worked part time for Home Depot for 10 years , on top of working full-time at an aluminum processing company , which did not pay a tax-related bonus . Smith said he will probably work until he is 70 .\nAsked how he felt about Trump , Smith said : \u201c To be honest , I can \u2019 t stand the man . \u201d\nTrump supporter Will Ortega , 32 , was happy to see trickle-down economics in action when he got a bigger paycheck due to the tax cuts .\nA supervisor at an infrastructure safety company , which controls traffic during highway renovation projects in San Antonio , Ortega \u2019 s take-home bimonthly paycheck went up by $ 50 , and he knew exactly what to do with it .\n\u201c Lunch money , \u201d he said , sitting at his desk wearing his neon yellow work clothes . \u201c I was real careful with how I spent my money on food . Now it \u2019 s like if I want to go out to eat an extra day or not wake up early to make lunch , I don \u2019 t have to worry about it . \u201d\nOrtega , who lives with his girlfriend and their 1-year-old daughter , makes about $ 50,000 a year .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a firm believer in the trickle-down economics of it , he said . \u201c I \u2019 m real happy that my boss got a tax break , given he \u2019 s not a Fortune 500 CEO . \u201d\nOrtega said his boss was investing back into the company , which benefited all the workers .\n\u201c He \u2019 s making more money , and in turn , we just picked up two brand new trucks , so it \u2019 s a lot more comfortable for the guys to work in . We \u2019 re also able to hire more guys and take some of the workload off us , \u201d he said .\nWhen it comes to Trump , Ortega said he would vote for him again , despite his dislike of Trump \u2019 s social media presence .\n\u201c As a celebrity on social media , I think he \u2019 s worthless and I can \u2019 t stand him . As for the policies he \u2019 s put into effect and the progress he \u2019 s making , I couldn \u2019 t be happier , \u201d he said .\nAn administrative assistant at a university outside Boston , Liz Hammond , 36 , was skeptical the tax cuts passed by Congress in December would mean much for her financially . And then her paycheck rose by about $ 5 a week .\nHammond , who lives in Somerville with her boyfriend and cat , said she fears that the tax package will lead to cuts down the road in social spending programs .\n\u201c I have friends who are on food stamps and disability and things like that , and we don \u2019 t have a ( federal ) budget sorted out and I am terrified we \u2019 ll lose these programs , \u201d Hammond said , adding that she would gladly have given up the tax cut if it protected those programs .\nHammond said she did not vote for Trump and was no likelier to vote for his re-election . The new law cut the federal income tax rate on her roughly $ 45,000 salary to 22 percent from 25 percent , a cut that is set to expire in 10 years .\n\u201c When I \u2019 ve finished paying off my student loans and start to accumulate money and maybe think about saving for a house , it \u2019 s not going to be there , \u201d Hammond said . \u201c I don \u2019 t know anyone who is benefiting from this . \u201d\nJeff Anderson , a 33-year-old account manager for a software company in Lincoln , Nebraska , said he received a $ 1,000 bonus because of the tax cut , about $ 600 after taxes .\n\u201c I was able to purchase a few things I \u2019 ve been putting off , \u201d Anderson said . \u201c My computer was failing so I built a new one . I bought a few books . The remainder is in savings , just in case . \u201d\nA registered Democrat who said the bonus represents less than 1 percent of his annual salary , Anderson describes himself as \u201c socially liberal , fiscally conservative . \u201d\nAnderson lives with his wife in a modest brick home , where he spends his free time brewing craft beer , cooking , gardening and doing home improvement projects .\nAlthough Anderson did not read the tax cut legislation , he feels the benefits depend on demographics .\n\u201c I have a feeling the effects will be as varied as the people who make up this country , \u201d he said .\nAnderson said he did not vote for Trump , whom he feels has no respect for people from different backgrounds .\n\u201c To put it nicely , I think he \u2019 s the embodiment of everything bad about this country , \u201d he said .\nA graduate assistant making $ 1,000 a month at Indiana University in Bloomington , Michael Jefferson was disappointed to see a modest $ 15.22 increase in his paycheck this month as a result of the tax cut bill .\n\u201c So about $ 15 a month for me is maybe a third of a tank of gas or maybe two trips to Chick-fil-A , \u201d Jefferson said . \u201c Frankly , the largest tax cut in history was a big bust . \u201d\nJefferson , 27 , who is originally from Indianapolis , is studying for a dual masters degree in public affairs and environmental science . He has voted Republican in the past but did not vote for Trump .\n\u201c This cut is evidence of the fact that he is more show than he is substance , \u201d Jefferson said .\nWhen not working as a graduate assistant , Jefferson has three other jobs : substitute teacher , application reviewer for Teach for America and research assistant .\n\u201c As a graduate student who makes about $ 20,000 a year , I saw this as a massive giveaway for the rich , \u201d he said . \u201c This bill hasn \u2019 t changed the fact that I still have to work several different jobs to make ends meet . \u201d\nAlthough he is in the lowest tax bracket , Jefferson owns stock in DowDupont Inc DWDP.N and said his investments did increase as a result of the bill \u2019 s benefiting mostly big companies .\n\u201c People who get the largest benefit are not the people who need it , \u201d he said .\nA Republican who is disillusioned by Trump , Byron Johnson , 37 , a personal banker in Chicago who grew up on the city \u2019 s South Side , expects to benefit from tax breaks as a small-time real estate investor .\nBut the self-described Christian , who has a wife and four kids and lives in a four-bedroom condo in Chicago \u2019 s West Loop neighborhood , feels the tax policy will not help those less fortunate , like some of the struggling families he knew growing up .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard for a parent to say , Should I pay bills today or should I buy groceries ? \u201d he said .\nJohnson works at Fifth Third Bank in the city \u2019 s Loop and also invests in real estate , buying apartment buildings and single-family homes on Chicago \u2019 s West and South sides , rehabilitating them and renting them out . Johnson said he made over $ 100,000 a year from his real estate business alone .\nHe expects to get an even bigger tax break under the new tax law for writing off clothes for meetings , gas , car and part of his home since it includes a small office .\nJohnson said he plans to use the extra money for college tuition and weddings of his children , now ages 1 to 13 , and to invest in more real estate .\nJohnson had flown from London , where he lived previously , back to Chicago to vote for Trump because he felt successful corporate people paid too much in taxes .
