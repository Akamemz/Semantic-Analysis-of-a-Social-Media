Trump displayed the factual command of a small child , the emotional stability of a hormonal teen , and the stamina of an old man , staggering and losing the thread as the 90 minutes wore on . Instead , Republicans \u2014 without a single exception I have seen \u2014 have responded very differently . They have treated their candidate \u2019 s glaring unsuitability for high office as , at worst , a handful of discrete errors that in no way reflect on his character , and at best , the dastardly unfairness of the liberal media .\nAmong the optimists was conservative columnist Holman Jenkins , who registered his approval with the candidate \u2019 s ability to clear two impressive hurdles : make it through the debate without literally dying , and display the ability to make at least one planned action . \u201c He is not a lifelong politician like Mrs. Clinton and it showed , \u201d writes Jenkins . \u201c But he survived on stage .
