So who are Mike Bloomberg 's supporters , and why have they backed him ?\nRecent polling by NPR/PBS/Marist puts Mr Bloomberg in second place , behind Bernie Sanders , with 19 % of the Democratic vote .\nMr Bloomberg will no doubt face questions on his political past - including recently revealed comments on women , farmers and minorities - on Wednesday , when he takes to the debate stage for the first time in Las Vegas , Nevada .\nHe wo n't appear on any ballots , however , until Super Tuesday - 3 March , when some of the biggest states , like California and Texas , hold their primary contests .\nWhile liberals have attacked him over controversial policies during his tenure as mayor , his billionaire status and for having switched party affiliations in the past , Mr Bloomberg has also been a strong investor in many key causes for Democratic voters .\nHe spent some $ 100m ( \u00a377m ) backing Democrats in the 2018 mid-term elections , which saw a record number of women voted to Congress . He founded the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety group to lobby for gun control policies . He has given more than $ 1bn to public health causes and over $ 278m to climate change initiatives .\nThink of a Bernie Sanders supporter and there 's a good chance an image pops into your mind of someone young , progressive , possibly male .\nLooking at polling data and anecdotally at rallies , it appears most of Mr Bloomberg 's grassroots supporters skew older . Pro-Bloomberg groups on social media are run by older-than-middle-aged Americans ; there may be some racial diversity , but little when it comes to age .\nA Quinnipiac poll last week found most of the former mayor 's support came from voters aged 50 and up who make over $ 50,000 a year .\nHere 's how Mr Bloomberg 's grassroots supporters responded to some of the biggest criticisms against him - and why they say they are all in for Mike 2020 .\nFor New Yorker Laura Wagner , Mr Bloomberg 's money is far from a downside .\n`` You have to be a billionaire [ to run ] and then when you are , you 're criticised for it ! '' she says , noting how much campaigns must fundraise and that most modern US presidents have been very wealthy .\nMs Wagner , a Sotheby 's realty associate and contributing columnist to the Italian and English newspaper La Voce in her 50s , agrees the money plays a big factor in Mr Bloomberg 's candidacy . But that , she says , is not a bad thing .\n`` All the power to him because he 's using it , in my opinion , so effectively . He 's not going to be bartering with these big oil companies and organisations , the NRA [ National Rifle Association ] , or trying to appease .\n`` Donald Trump would like to be what Michael Bloomberg is in terms of the power , the money . ''\nAll of the supporters who spoke to the BBC echoed that Mr Bloomberg 's successful business record was a highlight , not a hindrance .\n`` And being the mayor of New York City for three terms is pretty close to being president of the United States , '' Ms Wagner adds .\nPerhaps the biggest issue from Mr Bloomberg 's mayoral past is this policy , which allowed police to question and search individuals for weapons or illegal items . Most people stopped were innocent ; most were black or Latino .\n`` Stop , question and frisk '' pre-dated Mr Bloomberg but peaked during his tenure , with around five million stops over a decade . Analysis of the programme in the years since has suggested the random investigative stops did not have a meaningful impact on crime .\nIn 2013 , a federal judge ruled the tactic was unconstitutional , violating the rights of minority residents .\nThis month , audio emerged from 2015 where Mr Bloomberg claimed male minorities perpetrate `` the real crime '' . He 's since apologised for the policy and `` the impact it had on black and Latino communities '' .\nSheikh Musa Drammeh , 58 , is a religious leader and community activist who has lived in the Bronx and Harlem neighbourhoods of New York City for the last 30 years .\nWhen asked about the controversial policy , Mr Drammeh emphasised : `` No candidate will ever do as much for the blacks and Latinos as Bloomberg . ''\n`` I am black , '' Mr Drammeh continues . `` Nobody can tell me about the ravages of crime in this city - I know it , I live it , I 'm a victim of it .\n`` And Bloomberg did not create stop and frisk , [ but ] Bloomberg 's administration saw that you must have a habitable environment otherwise investors , residents , high-earning individuals who will pay taxes to support social services , will leave the city . ''\nMr Drammeh says from what he has seen as an activist working to stop gang violence , people in his neighbourhoods have `` benefitted from stop and frisk '' .\n`` It 's not discriminatory , it 's life saving . The lives that are being saved are black and brown , not white . ''\nCarla Shead , a 49-year-old from Maryland , told the BBC : `` It 'll take another New Yorker to beat Trump . ''\nMs Shead adds that Mr Bloomberg has proven himself by being `` a successful businessman and a successful mayor '' and `` has put his money where his mouth is '' .\n`` When I started listening to his ads and what he had to say about building the community and what his plan was to do for the United States - he is everything Trump is n't . And that to me , is the bottom line . ''\nMs Shead says that the divides in this country have been around for a long time . Her family is from Mississippi , she says , and many were active participants in the US civil rights movement .\n`` America is looking for a saviour right now , '' she says . `` Trump from the beginning has split the nation and has dredged up old wounds .\n`` My family and other African-American families - are vested in this - in seeing the country coming together and I think Mike Bloomberg is doing the exact opposite of what Trump is doing . ''\nBan assault-style weapons and implement better background checks for gun purchases\nTuition-free two-year public college , debt-free four-year college for lowest income students\nCreate public health insurance option while expanding enrolment in Obamacare plans\nNew 5 % wealth tax on annual incomes of over $ 5m\nMr Bloomberg has come under fire for sexist comments he allegedly made in 1990 , including reportedly telling a pregnant employee she should `` kill it '' , which he has denied under oath . The remarks have prompted comparisons to President Donald Trump .\nBut Darryl Morin , 52 , told the BBC that he does not see any similarities between these allegations of sexism .\n`` I hear a lot of hearsay , '' he says . `` I know there 's been inflammatory rhetoric but I have n't seen any smoking gun like we did with Donald Trump . ''\n`` Just seeing everything he 's done to help people around him , people of colour , women - I take him at him at his word , '' Mr Morin says , adding that Mr Bloomberg has elevated women within his organisation .\n`` Anybody who tries to say he 's trying to hold minorities down , I 'd argue vigorously he 's done the opposite . ''\nMr Morin , who lives in Franklin , Wisconsin , has also attended a number of rallies this election cycle and says while Mr Bloomberg has work to do when it comes to younger voters , he draws a generally diverse crowd .\n`` I 'm Hispanic , there 's Asian Americans , African Americans , non-minorities . It really is a more thoughtful crowd rather than just supporting a person or idea . ''\nHe says the rallies have been respectful and that the former mayor answers questions about policies and his past in an upfront way .\n`` Once people see that , they realise that this is a man that really has spent the latter parts of his life trying to help everyone have equal access to that American dream . ''\nDespite his ad buys with Instagram influencers to target younger audiences , Mr Bloomberg 's biggest support base still stems from an older crowd .\nBut Joe Nicoletti , 53 , who helps manage pro-Bloomberg groups on Facebook , says `` that 's what campaigns are for . Telling your story and widening your tent . ''\nMr Nicoletti , who lives in Sandy Hook , Connecticut , told the BBC he liked `` the fact that [ Bloomberg ] has been both a Republican and Democrat '' . And the former mayor 's views , he added , are moderate , and `` more in line with the majority of the country '' .\nAccording to a February Pew Research Center analysis of the candidates ' supporters , Mr Bloomberg 's base is much less liberal than his 2020 rivals .\nOnly 29 % describe themselves as liberal with the majority saying they are moderate or conservative . In this vein , 79 % of Mr Bloomberg 's base say they want a candidate who will work with Republicans and compromise on policies if need be .\n`` There 's a reason why Donald Trump and Donald Trump supporters want to face Bernie Sanders in the general election , '' Mr Nicoletti says . `` Pete Buttigieg is an impressive candidate , but Mike despite the stop and frisk issue has much broader support with people of colour . ''\nHe adds that some of the criticism levied at Mr Bloomberg is `` hypocritical '' .\n`` When Mike Bloomberg used his money to help flip the house , elect more women candidates , push gun control legislation , and help flip the Virginia house , I do n't remember hearing them complain .
