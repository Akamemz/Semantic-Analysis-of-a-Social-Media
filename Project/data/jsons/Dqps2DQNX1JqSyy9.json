Mr. Obama hailed him as \u201c the leader that our troops deserve. \u201d Mr. Hagel \u2019 s experience as a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War should give him a special rapport with the troops as well as make him an authoritative voice on the measured use of force . Like Mr. Obama , Mr. Hagel has been deeply critical of the war in Iraq and is believed to favor a more rapid drawdown of troops from Afghanistan . He has also wisely advocated paring the bloated defense budget .\nMr. Hagel \u2019 s independence and willingness to challenge Republican orthodoxy on Iraq , sanctions on Iran and other issues \u2014 both in the Senate and later as an administration adviser \u2014 have so alarmed neocons , hard-line pro-Israel interest groups and some Republican senators that they unleashed a dishonest campaign to pre-emptively bury the nomination . It failed , but the confirmation process could be bruising . The opponents are worried that Mr. Hagel will not be sufficiently in lock step with the current Israeli government and can not be counted on to go to war against Iran over its nuclear program if it comes to that .\nWe are encouraged by what we hear about Mr. Hagel \u2019 s preference for a negotiated solution with Iran , his reluctance to go to war , and his support for Israel \u2019 s security , for a two-state solution and for reductions in nuclear weapons . If confirmed , he would have to tackle the hard job of cutting the defense budget and balancing the competing needs of the different services .\nMr. Brennan has worked closely with Mr. Obama over four years as the counterterrorism adviser . He was at the president \u2019 s side during the raid on Osama bin Laden , and pushed an expanded strategy of using drones to kill terrorism suspects . Mr. Brennan withdrew from consideration for the C.I.A . post four years ago after human rights advocates said that he had failed to stop President George W. Bush \u2019 s use of torture in interrogating prisoners . He denied those charges at the time , but the Senate Intelligence Committee should revisit the issue at his confirmation hearing . He also should be deeply questioned about how the White House decides on the targets of drone strikes , and whether the American public will ever know if there are explicit rules for these killings .\nIn his second term , President Obama has an opportunity to put his stamp more firmly on America \u2019 s relations with the world . He needs his own team to do that , and the Senate should move as quickly as possible to a vote . Ultimately though , Mr. Obama will need some new approaches to achieve new goals , not just new people .",
