Our response has been consistently that such concessions are unwarranted , would be fundamentally unfair to players , and our sport deserves the fullest 2020 season possible . These remain our positions today , particularly in light of new reports regarding MLB \u2019 s national television rights \u2014 information that we requested from the league weeks ago but were never provided .\n\u201c As a result , it unfortunately appears that further dialogue with the league would be futile . It \u2019 s time to get back to work . Tell us when and where . \u2019 \u2019\nIn other words , the union now is simply waiting for Commissioner Rob Manfred to unilaterally impose a short season , perhaps as few as 50 games , which would require the players to be paid at a prorated basis .\n`` We have been consistent and upfront about everything from the beginning , \u2019 \u2019 said Andrew Miller , a member of the union \u2019 s executive committee . `` We want to play and have made that abundantly clear .
