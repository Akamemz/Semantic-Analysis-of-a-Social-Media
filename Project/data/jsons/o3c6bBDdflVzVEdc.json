The Obama campaign and its allies laid out $ 21.1 million for TV during the two weeks of the party conventions . Over that same stretch , Republican Mitt Romney and his backers spent significantly less , $ 12.9 million .\nWith that cash advantage , the Obama campaign bought a better-than 2-to-1 advantage in the number of ads airing in battleground states .\nThe media project \u2014 a joint effort by political scientists at Wesleyan College in Connecticut , Bowdoin College in Maine and the University of Washington \u2014 bases its estimates on data from Kantar Media/CMAG , which tracks TV ads . The estimates cover broadcast television and national cable .\n`` We would n't want to suggest that the convention , and the national media attention and coverage , may not have been influential , '' Wesleyan political scientist Erika Franklin Fowler , a co-director of the project , tells NPR . But she adds : `` If you have such an advantage on the airwaves , that is also likely to have an effect . ''\nShe says President Obama appeared to use TV to counter attacks from the Republican convention and then held that advantage during the Democratic convention .\nThe project tallies 40,974 ads on behalf of Obama versus 17,779 for Romney . Of the ads for Obama , 91 percent came from the Obama campaign itself \u2014 a sign of fundraising strength by the campaign committee and the Democratic National Committee , but also a measure of how badly the Democratic outside groups have fared with big donors .\nOn the GOP side , the spending was lopsided the other way , with 72 percent of the ads coming from three outside groups that take unregulated contributions : the pro-Romney superPAC Restore Our Future ; another pro-GOP superPAC , American Crossroads ; and the social welfare organization Americans For Prosperity , backed by the billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch . The superPACs disclose their donors . Americans For Prosperity is allowed by law to keep its donors secret .\nAnother powerful social welfare organization was missing from the presidential race these past two weeks .
