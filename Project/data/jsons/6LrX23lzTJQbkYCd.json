Bush , for the absence of American troops in Iraq and rejected the assertion that he could have left a small peacekeeping force in the war-torn nation .\nHe uttered those after three years , and a successful re-election campaign , in which the full removal of U.S. forces from Iraq was cast as this White House \u2019 s most significant foreign policy achievement and one Mr. Obama had promised all the way back to the earliest days of his first presidential campaign in 2008 .\nNow , however , with the terrorist force the Islamic State running roughshod through Iraq , capturing key territory , slaughtering Christians and promising to \u201c raise the flag of Allah at the White House , \u201d Mr. Obama has begun to adjust the narrative .\n\u201c What I just find interesting is the degree to which this issue keeps on coming up , as if this was my decision .
