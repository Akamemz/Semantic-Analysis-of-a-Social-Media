( Noah Berger/Reuters )\nThe California Court of Appeals rules that a transgender patient can sue a Catholic hospital for refusing to perform a hysterectomy .\nYesterday , the California Court of Appeals issued a truly remarkable opinion in a truly remarkable case . It held that a Catholic hospital could indeed face legal liability for failing to perform a hysterectomy as part of a female-to-male \u201c transition \u201d \u2014 even though its policy broadly bans sterilization surgery generally ( not just for trans individuals ) and even though the hospital referred the patient to a non-Catholic facility in the same network .
