Tech tally: What campaigns learned\n\nTuesday\u2019s midterms are shaping up to be a great political tech equalizer.\n\nBoth parties head into the final hours of the 2014 campaign bragging about their enhanced ability to keep tabs on who has requested and returned absentee ballots. Democrats and Republicans have the data and are spending millions of dollars targeting last-minute TV and online advertising toward niche audiences like baseball fans and even Gilligan's Island insomniacs. They can also track what\u2019s trending on Twitter from Little Rock to Denver, honing their campaign message to deal with the unexpected.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTypically, great political tech innovations debut during a White House campaign when there\u2019s plenty of money and manpower to spare.\n\nBut while little truly groundbreaking has been deployed on the election front in 2014, campaign strategists from both sides of the aisle have ripped from President Barack Obama\u2019s old campaign playbooks and pushed out their own scaled-down digital tools in this year\u2019s key House, Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\n( POLITICO's polling center)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no off-year anymore,\u201d said Gerrit Lansing, the National Republican Congressional Committee\u2019s digital director. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to take a quarter or two off in terms of pushing the envelope for what\u2019s best.\u201d\n\nWhether the Democrats can hold onto the tech advantage they\u2019d built in 2012 remains an open question, and it\u2019s one that won\u2019t be resolved even if the party loses its Senate majority on Election Day. After all, the 2016 presidential race is right on the horizon and both parties are about to be tested again on a much larger playing field.\n\nWith the obvious caveats tied to a midterm election, here\u2019s a look at five ways Democratic and Republican campaigns have been building off Obama\u2019s technology lessons in search of the upper hand in 2014:\n\n1. Raising money\n\nThis cycle has proven there\u2019s very little politicians won\u2019t do for a donation.\n\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)\n\nSure, email fundraising has been around for a while. But House Democrats have taken things to an entirely new level in 2014 with a relentless stream of \u2018sky-is-falling\u2019 missives seeking to jolt donors into giving with URGENT warnings about what will happen if Republicans gain control of both chambers in Congress.\n\nCritics warn that the velocity and tenor of so many terror-stricken emails \u2014 Republicans are doing it too \u2014 isn\u2019t sustainable. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen an unprecedented race to the bottom,\u201d said Obama\u2019s 2012 digital director, Teddy Goff.\n\nBut while the messages have provided ample fodder for late-night television comedy, they\u2019ve also been a very successful new revenue stream for both parties. \u201cWe are funding our ads today, the vast majority today, through digital means,\u201d Matt Canter, the deputy executive director at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said during a recent panel discussion on the midterms at Google\u2019s Washington headquarters.\n\nIt\u2019s not just email where campaigns are finding technology can help them raise cash.\n\nBoth parties have figured out over the last two years how to make the donation process a simpler online experience \u2014 from storing names, addresses and credit card information to already having a specific dollar amount listed in the email based on what someone previously gave.\n\n( Full 2014 election results)\n\nWhile there remain plenty of missed opportunities on the mobile front, House Republicans say their one-click system was a key aspect in helping raise as much in September as they did in the entire 2012 cycle. On the left, the PayPal-like ActBlue system has brought in more than 5 million donations this cycle.\n\nMost candidate websites are now in on the act too by tracking a visitor\u2019s log-in location. Out-of-state visitors are seen as more likely to donate and commonly get met first with a pitch for money. Someone from inside the state\u2019s borders is seen as a potential voter and can often access a biography or issue page without first getting hit up for cash.\n\n2. Skipping TV\n\nCampaigns are playing a cat-and-mouse game trying to keep up with voters\u2019 ever-changing media habits.\n\nSkipping live television? Candidates can now air commercials to specific groups of people streaming their favorite sitcoms, movies and news through the web. Using your phone to follow Twitter or Facebook comments during a ball game? Social media ads can be tailored to targets too.\n\nThere\u2019s more than meets the eye for how the campaigns make the connections they do with these online voters.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have spent the last two years scrubbing their voter files and other consumer data, trying to match specific persuadable supporters with their specific web habits. The parties are also looking for inexpensive ways to find voters who live in expensive TV markets and also in parts of a state or congressional district that is primarily fed by a media market located in a neighboring state.
