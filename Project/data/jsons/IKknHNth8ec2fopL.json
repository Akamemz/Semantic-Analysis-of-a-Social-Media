It's a trend, not a bombshell\n\nBoth the confusing and less-relevant, though politically more popular, \"unemployment rate,\" and the more important number of jobs created, have been trending in the right direction. There's nothing in today's number that fundamentally changes the fact that we're moving more slowly than was predicted and more slowly than we'd like to be moving.\n\nIt is to President Obama's advantage if you subscribe to trend and Mitt Romney's if you think it is too slow.

Neither candidate has a real plan\n\nPolling continues to show that Americans are generally partisan and split when evaluating which candidate will create more jobs. That's because neither has a plan (though both have dreams and aspirations), and most people realize that the president has limited ability to motivate the large-scale creation of jobs in the private sector, which is where it needs to happen.\n\n3.

They have been dishonest.\n\n4. Both plans are based on an average of 4% economic growth over the next term\n\nWe're at 2% now. 3% next year if we're lucky (see below). 4% is something virtually no economists say is likely.

It's 50% higher than the best current projections. Obama, for his part, does have a better plan, based largely on the hidden \"infrastructure bank\" in his Jobs Act, which never got passed. But I talk about that more than he ever did. He's afraid of the best part of his plan for some reason.\n\n5. Europe's the problem, not China\n\nEurope's getting worse, not better. It's like a head cold; even once you start treating it, it still has to run its course and will get worse before it gets better. That hurts the U.S. -- and its need to achieve an average of 4% economic growth over the next four years. And we were all betting on a growing middle class in China, which would buy anything American-made that wasn't nailed down. But what Europe isn't buying, China isn't making.
