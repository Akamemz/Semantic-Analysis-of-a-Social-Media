    "content": "The spiraling rise of both college costs and student debt has slowed , according to a new report from the College Board . But even though costs aren \u2019 t rising as steeply as they were , they are still rising , and the failure of aid to keep pace with tuition increases means that the net cost students pay for college continues to go up .\nThat \u2019 s one conclusion from the 30th annual `` Trends in College Pricing '' and `` Trends in College Aid '' reports the College Board released Wednesday . Taken together , the comprehensive reports provide not just a snapshot at how both tuition and student aid are shifting in the most recent year \u2013 in which they have been under scrutiny by policymakers determined to make college more affordable \u2013 but also how they \u2019 ve changed over the past three decades .\n\u201c The rapid increases in published college prices have slowed , \u201d says College Board President David Coleman . \u201c However , students and their families are paying more because grant aid hasn \u2019 t kept up. \u201d Still , despite the rising costs , Mr. Coleman emphasizes that a college education \u2013 as evidenced in another recent College Board report , `` Education Pays '' \u2013 is worth it . \u201c I do not want to diminish the real concern around student debt and the price of college , \u201d Coleman says . \u201c But a college education is one of the best investments students and their families can make in terms of health , income , and upward mobility . \u201d\nAmong the key findings from this year 's \u201c Trends \u201d reports are the following :\n\u2022 Published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges increased 2.9 percent from 2012-13 to 2013-14 \u2013 the smallest one-year increase since 1975-76 . After adjusting for inflation , the increase is 0.9 percent , the lowest inflation-adjusted increase since 2000-01 .\n\u2022 Between 2010-11 and 2012-13 , federal grant aid declined \u2013 a major reason that net prices rose for families . Because of earlier increases in aid , the average net price for full-time students attending in-state , public four-year colleges actually fell by $ 650 ( in 2013 dollars ) between 2008-09 and 2009-10 , but between 2009-10 and 2013-14 it increased from $ 1,940 to $ 3,120 .\n\u2022 Over the decade from 2002-03 to 2012-13 , the total number of federal undergraduate and graduate student loan borrowers increased by 69 percent , and the average annual amount borrowed increased by 6 percent , from $ 7,900 ( in 2012 dollars ) in 2002-03 to $ 8,350 . In 2012-13 , the average undergraduate federal loan was $ 6,760 , and the average graduate student loan was $ 17,230 .\n\u2022 Total Pell Grant expenditures peaked at $ 37.5 billion in 2010-11 ( in 2012 dollars ) and declined to $ 32.3 billion by 2012-13 . Both the average grant and the number of recipients were lower in 2012-13 than in 2010-11 .\nPart of the affordability problem is that family income has fallen even as prices for college have risen , says Sandy Baum , co-author of the Trends reports . After adjusted for inflation , real income at all levels of the income distribution were lower in 2012 than they were in 2002 , and at the bottom quintile , family income declined by 13 percent in that decade .\nMs. Baum said the College Board focused the hardest on the \u201c net price \u201d students pay , since most students have access to some form of aid or tax credits , but says that \u201c the news in terms of the college price increase is that it does seem that the spiral is moderating\u2026 . Price increases are moderating , and financial aid is still there , but it \u2019 s not increasing at the rate it would have to to cushion students from the rate increases . \u201d\nThe report also highlights the vast differences between states , both in how much they charge for tuition \u2013 and how much the state subsidizes that tuition \u2013 and in how they grant their aid .\nSouth Carolina and Georgia , for instance , are the most generous with their grant aid per full-time student . But in Georgia , none of that aid is needs-based , and in South Carolina , only 16 percent of the state grand aid was needs-based .\nAnd in 2013-14 , published tuition and fees for in-state students at flagship universities range from $ 4,404 a year at the University of Wyoming to $ 17,926 at Penn State-University Park .\n\u201c There are dramatic differences depending on where you live , \u201d says Baum .\nIn 2012-13 , 49 percent of all student aid was in the form of grants \u2013 the highest percentage over the past decade . But many students are still borrowing . Some 60 percent of students who earned bachelor \u2019 s degrees in 2011-12 from the public and private nonprofit institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt , borrowing an average of $ 26,500 . Some 1.6 million students are in income-based repayment plans \u2013 about 11 percent of borrowers .\nThe College Board has published the trends on both college pricing and student aid and borrowing annually for 30 years now , but this year , the reports come at a time of increased attention to the college affordability problem .\nIn August , President Obama drew attention to the problem and called for a new college ranking system that would emphasize things like graduation rates and sticker price as a means to help make colleges more affordable .\n`` We \u2019 re going to start rating colleges not just by which college is the most selective , not just by which college is the most expensive , not just by which college has the nicest facilities \u2013 you can get all of that on the existing rating systems . What we want to do is rate them on who 's offering the best value so students and taxpayers get a bigger bang for their buck , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a speech last month at the University of Buffalo , in New York .\nNumerous people , including a number of colleges , have pushed back against that proposal \u2013 and it remains unlikely that this Congress would agree to tie federal student aid to such a system \u2013 but most people agree that spiraling college costs and student debt are a problem .\nThe latest data from the Trends reports , says Baum , show that \u201c there aren \u2019 t any magic bullets here. \u201d What \u2019 s needed , she and Coleman say , is to be thinking more about appropriately targeting student aid for those who need it most , having adequate public funding for higher education , and providing better guidance for students trying to navigate the complex decisions involved . Often the least information is available to the students who need it most , they say , and the College Board is working to get better information to low-income students .\nBut they also emphasize the value , despite the rising costs , that a college education still gives students \u2013 and worry that the current discussion about the danger of taking on debt will discourage some students from getting that education , particularly those with the least access to good information , or who don \u2019 t have family members who have gone to college .\n\u201c It is imperative that we provide the best information possible to students and their families about the value of a college education and what debt really means , \u201d says Coleman , noting that the average debt for a bachelor \u2019 s degree recipient is $ 26,500 \u2013 which could be repaid in 10 years by payments of less than $ 300 per month . But studies show that an average bachelor \u2019 s degree recipient can expect to earn an extra $ 550,000 to $ 600,000 in income in his or her lifetime compared with those who do not , he says . \u201c I don \u2019 t diminish the real concerns about the price of college , but it is a moral and social imperative that we \u2019 re clear about the truth . \u201d",
