Now the Times\u2014like all newspapers\u2014is grappling with economic headwinds and the rise of the smartphone , and its future is on the line once again .\n\u201c The Times has changed enormously in the past few years , but it still hasn \u2019 t changed enough , \u201d said David Leonhardt , a prominent economics columnist who is overseeing a sweeping strategic review by a team of seven Times journalists known as the 2020 Group , a sort of advisory committee for executive editor Dean Baquet . \u201c That \u2019 s why he thinks we need to do this . \u201d\nIn a staff memo last month , Baquet warned that the newsroom \u201c will have to change significantly\u2014swiftly and fearlessly. \u201d Some of these changes are already coming into focus , from a big reimagining of the metro section ( \u201c what a New York report should look like for a news organization that is increasingly international \u201d ) , to a complex reorientation of how the print edition is put together . ( \u201c Assigning editors , in the very near future , will not worry about filling space . \u201d )\nWhether the gravity of many of the prescribed changes has hit home yet for most Times people is up for debate . But Baquet has delivered the message in broad terms .\nSwift changes , his May memo said , are necessary for the Times to remain \u201c the world \u2019 s premier news organization , \u201d and to not be \u201c left behind \u201d as it tangles with the punishing economics of modern newspaper publishing and an army of digital competitors like nothing the media industry has ever seen . Baquet also confirmed that further cost-cutting is in store for the newsroom .\nFittingly , according to interviews with more than a dozen Times sources , Project 2020 has sent a ripple of anxiety throughout the building . No one really knows what the place is going to look like a year from now , let alone by 2020 .\nAs one source put it : \u201c People want answers to how their jobs are gon na change . \u201d\nThe Times admits it hasn \u2019 t adapted quickly enough to survive in a media environment in which everyone \u2019 s reading the news on their phones , and where even the most robust print edition can \u2019 t make enough money to sustain an army of 1,300 journalists . Layoffs and buyouts have been a familiar reality since 2008\u2014when the economic downturn forced the Times \u2019 newsroom into a mass culling ( 100 positions ) for the first time\u2014even though the creation of new positions has kept the overall headcount mostly flat .\nIt \u2019 s not as if they haven \u2019 t been moving in the right direction . Over the past few years , there have been strides in areas like video , graphics and social media , despite high-profile management stumbles like the messy firings of a CEO ( Janet Robinson ) in 2012 and an executive editor ( Jill Abramson ) in 2014 , both of which laid bare fractious conflicts within the company \u2019 s top leadership ranks .\nOn the business side , the Times \u2019 decision in 2011 to start charging people to read an unlimited number of articles on nytimes.com proved to be a life-saving calculation , bringing the Times more than a million digital-only subscribers to date and nearly $ 200 million in circulation revenue last year alone .\nBut the water is rising again and those numbers must grow . Soon , the Times is likely to hit a ceiling on how many people in its existing audience it can convert into paying subscribers . If it can \u2019 t get more money out of the same customers , it must find new ones .\nThat \u2019 s what \u2019 s behind a plan implemented earlier this year that puts $ 50 million behind the prospect of getting many new readers to open their wallets in foreign markets , where the Times is creating digital editions tailored to non-Americans .\nA unit creating content that might just pass for journalism were it not paid for by advertisers also is making dents in the Times \u2019 march toward $ 800 million in digital revenues by 2020 , an ambitious goal considering digital revenues were just south of $ 400 million in 2015 .\nThe problem is that while print advertising is still a big slice of company revenues ( $ 441.6 million out of $ 1.58 billion in 2015 ) , it \u2019 s been plummeting year after year as marketers become hotter on digital , and tech giants like Facebook and Google dominate online ad growth .\nAt the same time , even as web traffic grew ( more than 70 million monthly U.S. visitors , according to the latest comScore stats ) and readers were turning to mobile devices in droves , the newsroom remained print-centric , driven by an obsession over what stories will appear on A1 day after day .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve basically been able to make strides on digital just on the sheer force of our journalism , \u201d a senior newsroom source told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It hasn \u2019 t been done in a smart way . \u201d\nIn 2014 , a group of Times journalists produced a now famous \u201c Innovation Report \u201d that concluded their employer was doing a poor job distributing its journalism online , especially in those precincts of the Internet that perhaps aren \u2019 t crawling with your average Times reader .\nIf that exercise was about tackling what needs to happen after a story gets published , the 2020 Group is more concerned with the before .\nThe committee has taken dozens of meetings with people inside the Times and out . Some of the discussions that have played out in those meetings are being put into practice .\nMetropolitan editor Wendell Jamieson is working on what he described to \u2588\u2588\u2588 as a \u201c big reboot \u201d of metro that will \u201c reimagine all of its classic beats \u201d and make the entire section resonate more with readers outside of New York .\n\u201c Everyone in the department \u2019 s gon na have a new job , \u201d he said , emphasizing that the idea for the pivot originated with metro . \u201c I \u2019 m trying to reimagine coverage of what I believe is the greatest city in the world as part of a global news organization . How do you cover New York differently when you \u2019 re covering it for the world as well as local readers ? \u201d\nIn the coming weeks and months , astute metro readers will begin to notice the disappearance of various recurring print columns , with the exception of two that are definitely not going away\u2014Jim Dwyer \u2019 s \u201c About New York \u201d and Ginia Bellafante \u2019 s \u201c Big City \u201d \u2014according to sources familiar with the plans . Authors will be freed up to write on a rolling basis , Jamieson said , so they can go after bigger fish .\n\u201c Does the model of a weekly or bi-weekly or twice-weekly column work in the mobile age ? \u201d he asked . \u201c It \u2019 s really an old daily newspaper confection . \u201d\nThe plan that \u2019 s taking shape , Jamieson continued , \u201c involves using all of the current metro resources and maybe redeploying them . I can see making an argument for more resources , but that \u2019 s obviously in the end not my call . \u201d\nPerhaps the most seismic change the 2020 Group has been involved in , various sources agreed , is an ongoing revamp of how the daily print edition gets put together .\nSome background : Last year , Baquet replaced the Times \u2019 legendary Page One morning editors \u2019 meeting with a 9:30 a.m. meeting to discuss how the biggest stories of the day should be covered and promoted digitally . The discussion of the front-page layout was moved to a 3:30 meeting of several editors led by Susan Chira , one of four deputy executive editors .\nIn October , Baquet took things a step further by announcing the creation of a centralized \u201c print hub , \u201d led by Tom Jolly , a veteran masthead editor , to take primary responsibility for mapping out the so-called \u201c daily miracle \u201d the Times has been sending to the presses since 1851 .\nIt \u2019 s hard to overstate the significance of these moves , because they impact how one of the world \u2019 s most influential news sources presents the world \u2019 s most important news every day to hundreds of thousands of people who read the Times in print . ( That , in turn , explains why print has for so long been an engine for distributing editorial power within the company . )\nAt the same time , the print hub serves as an acknowledgement that many more millions of readers are seeing the Times \u2019 most important stories on their computers and phones .\nThe idea is that , instead of editors who are in charge of various coverage areas being focused each day on which of their reporters \u2019 stories will appear in print , and where , and with how much space , these editors will put all of their energy into assigning and editing stories for digital without being bogged down by the evening production process , which becomes the purview of the print hub .\nTo give an example , the hub could theoretically decide to put a business story in the foreign section if they felt it made more sense for the reader . Likewise , individual desks could lobby for certain stories to be included and the hub could decline , though this would n't happen without discussion and argument .\nThe Times is still in the process of getting the hub up and running . So far , metro and international have both been incorporated , and all six daily sections are expected to be hubbified by Labor Day , according to Jolly .\nBut one of the trickiest questions being hashed out in the 2020 discussions , according to sources familiar with the matter , is how autonomous the hub should be .\nThere are competing theories at play . On the one hand , a completely autonomous print hub is better suited to make dispassionate decisions about what the most important stories from the digital lineup are and how prominently they should be featured in print . On the other , the assigning editors are the ones with the authority to know just how significant certain stories on their beats are . So how much consultation and input should they have into the print placement hierarchy ?\n\u201c There \u2019 s never going to be no consultation . That would be nuts . Unthinkable , \u201d one editor involved in the discussions told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It \u2019 s not gon na happen and nobody thinks that . It \u2019 s more a question of degree . \u201d\nThe 2020 Group is also looking at other initiatives already well underway , like the reconfiguration of beat structures ( do a bunch of different sections each need their own health reporter ? ) , the international expansion and the growth of video and visual journalism .\nThose latter two areas are seen as crucial in the Times \u2019 efforts to make itself relevant to younger readers who \u2019 ve probably never had to wipe newsprint ink off their fingertips .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a new generation , \u201d said Chira , \u201c whose preferences and tastes are very different than the way the Times has always seen itself . \u201d\nBut in terms of specific conclusions or recommendations for Baquet\u2014like areas where there needs to be more or less investment\u2014Times insiders say it \u2019 s all still a bit mysterious . \u201c They \u2019 re keeping it close to the vest for a reason , \u201d one editor told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nOne Friday earlier this month , during two standing-room-only \u201c all-hands \u201d sessions in a 15th-floor conference room , Leonhardt and another member of the group made presentations to help the newsroom understand what they \u2019 ve been working on .\nIt \u2019 s not uncommon for these types of conclaves to exude at least a dash of tension in the newsroom . And since the 2020 Group is evaluating ways in which the newsroom needs to change , what it needs to do more of , what it should be doing less of , the assembled reporters and editors might have expected at least one fiery jeremiad about job reductions and resources and the like .\n\u201c I was kind of stunned , \u201d said a person who was there . \u201c I expected it to be much more contentious . \u201d\nIn the midst of all these developments , there \u2019 s a sense of growing influence among a cohort of younger Times journalists who have been emerging in crucial newsroom leadership positions\u2014people in their 30s and 40s like Leonhardt , for example , or Lydia Polgreen ( global ) ; Alex MacCallum ( video ) ; Steve Duenes ( graphics ) , to name a few .\nNot to mention the fifth-generation members of the Sulzberger family that controls the paper\u2014Arthur Gregg Sulzberger ( lead architect of the Innovation Report ) and Sam Dolnick ( who drove the Times \u2019 splashy foray into virtual reality journalism ) , both of whom have moved into top digital roles .
