The addition of social media visibility has only poured kerosene on the subject . And now that people are fired up about activism following the 2016 election , actual motivation and commitment are harder to parse than ever .\nOver the weekend , Saturday Night Live grappled with performative activism on a corporate level and on a personal level , and delivered a master class in how not to be a good ally .\nThe centerpiece of this week \u2019 s episode , and the sketch everyone would be talking about if it weren \u2019 t for Alec Baldwin \u2019 s Bill O \u2019 Reilly , is this takedown of the Pepsi ad heard \u2019 round the world .\nThe original ad , so infamous last week that describing it now is probably redundant , featured Kendall Jenner joining a protest movement , armed with a can of Pepsi . It was catastrophically received before it was pulled from the internet . Not only does the ad appear to be a coup for Coca-Cola , as many have rightly pointed out , it was a coup for RC Cola and any other lower-tier soda brands waiting to step into the big leagues . One might even say it was a victory for the alt-right and anyone else wanting to suggest that beneath the veneer of righteousness , the so-called resistance has a corporate-sponsored core . ( The ad \u2019 s very existence kind of dovetails into the concept of \u201c professional protesters , \u201d which has been bandied about since the election , from the highest levels . )\nThe tragic flaws of the Pepsi ad should have been obvious to anyone involved in the making of it\u2013how using Black Lives Matter iconography to sell Pepsi trivializes the movement , how using people from different cultures as props is not at all the same as celebrating them , and how showing the way riot police respond to Kendall Jenner completely ignores the double standard of how those police have historically treated people of color . In the SNL sketch , we see a fictional representative of the makers of the ad , played by Beck Bennett , slowly realize all of these wild miscalculations . His shame and embarrassment should be a slight balm to anyone whose head hurts from shaking it at that ad all week .\nOf course , each of us is as individually fallible in matters of cultural sensitivity as global conglomerates like Pepsi . Another sketch from this week \u2019 s SNL skewered the rise of armchair activism , which is surely better intentioned than the Pepsi ad , but equally inefficient .\nIn \u201c Thank You , Scott , \u201d Louis CK \u2019 s hapless Scott is moved by all the injustice he sees in the world\u2013but not enough to actually do anything productive about it .
