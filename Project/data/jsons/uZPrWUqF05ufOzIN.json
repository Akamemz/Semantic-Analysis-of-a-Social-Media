    "content": "Donald Trump runs on fear . Once again , he \u2019 s closing out an election season with a direct appeal to the darkest impulses of the American psyche . \u201c The Democrats don \u2019 t care what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your communities , \u201d he said at a rally in Arizona last week , packing xenophobia into the false assertion that \u201c Democrats want to throw your borders wide open to deadly drugs and endless gangs. \u201d On Monday , he did the same when talking about the caravan of Honduran migrants heading for the United States , falsely saying that \u201c Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in \u201d with the group .\nTrump obviously believes his strategy of riling voters up with bigotry is effective . What \u2019 s striking is the political press agrees with him . \u201c This pure brute force from Trump could work , \u201d notes NBC News , \u201c because there is no equal response from Democrats. \u201d On Twitter , the New York Times \u2019 Maggie Haberman asserted similarly that this \u201c controversial , race-baiting \u201d rhetoric has been \u201c effective for him politically. \u201d And looking at these remarks in the context of the 2016 election , Axios asserts that \u201c immigration and stoking fear about Mexican immigrants propelled Trump to the White House . \u201d\nBut this conventional wisdom\u2014that bigotry wins votes and elections\u2014depends on imprecision around the idea of \u201c effective. \u201d The media has taken the fact that Trump became president after making those appeals as evidence they broadly work ; the fact that Republican primary voters endorsed Trump \u2019 s nativism and xenophobia has somehow become proof that it \u2019 s a viable election strategy whenever it \u2019 s deployed . But neither claim\u2014and both are key assumptions made by political analysts in the Trump era\u2014stands to serious scrutiny . And while Trump \u2019 s anti-immigrant rhetoric undoubtedly resonates with many Republicans , there \u2019 s no strong indication that it works on its own as an \u201c effective \u201d message among Americans writ large .\nRepublicans beyond Trump have made a similar gambit that racist insinuation will energize their supporters and move voters in their favor . In a predominantly white congressional district in upstate New York , GOP political groups have attacked Democrat Antonio Delgado , who is black , as a \u201c big city rapper \u201d who favors \u201c handouts \u201d from the government . In Florida , Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis has attacked his black opponent , Andrew Gillum , in terms that evoke racist tropes . In California , Republican incumbent Rep. Duncan Hunter has attacked his Arab-American challenger , Ammar Campa-Najjar , as a \u201c security risk \u201d with potential ties to \u201c radical Islam . \u201d\nThe proof of concept behind this strategy is Trump \u2019 s successful election . Trump relied on racism and anti-immigrant sentiment to drive his message , the argument goes , and while it may have produced some defections among college-educated whites , it also attracted enough whites without degrees to win narrow victories in places where they formed a large share of the voting population , including Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin . But missing from this narrative is the critical influence of Trump \u2019 s extremely optimistic message on jumpstarting the economy , which co-opted and muddled Hillary Clinton \u2019 s rhetoric on issues like wages and infrastructure . To voters cross-pressured by cultural conservatism on one end and liberal economic views on the other , Trump promised a synthesis attuned to their identities as blue collar white Americans\u2014they could have both .\nIt \u2019 s that synthesis which\u2014along with Clinton \u2019 s stark unpopularity and extraordinary events like the FBI \u2019 s intervention\u2014produced Trump \u2019 s victory . In its absence , Republicans have not fared nearly as well , even as they \u2019 ve tried to replicate the president \u2019 s strategy of open and explicit bigotry .\nThere \u2019 s concrete evidence of this . In the final weeks of the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial race , Republican Ed Gillespie remade himself as a demagogue by playing on white racial resentment with ads blasting Democrat Ralph Northam for \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d and the MS-13 gang . He promised to protect the state \u2019 s Confederate monuments and tried to tie Northam to professional football player Colin Kaepernick \u2019 s protest against police brutality . Gillespie lost by 9 percentage points , and Virginia Republicans came one seat from losing an almost 20-year majority in the House of Delegates .\nThe energy is so high , and the political environment so unique , that it \u2019 s difficult to project an outcome for November .\nAlabama Republicans similarly chose an authentically Trump-like figure , Roy Moore , to replace Jeff Sessions in the Senate . He ran a Trump-like campaign of dishonesty , demagoguery , and casual bigotry . He was even accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who alleged inappropriate behavior when they were teenagers and he was an attorney in his 30s . Despite this controversy , he was favored to win , running in an electorate that hadn \u2019 t chosen a Democrat for statewide office in more than a decade . But a Democratic surge , and Republican disenchantment , produced a surprise win for Doug Jones , the Democratic nominee .\nMost recently , the Republican candidate in the special election for Pennsylvania \u2019 s 18th Congressional District , Rick Saccone , described himself as \u201c Trump before Trump was Trump. \u201d He ran as an acolyte of the president in a district that politically and demographically favored the Republican Party . He lost by a slim margin to Democrat Conor Lamb .\nThe key difference between Trump and these candidates ? Economic messaging . Trump rejected conservative economic wisdom on retirement spending and other social programs during his presidential campaign , but neither Gillespie nor Moore nor Saccone had an economic agenda distinct from the national Republican Party . ( Saccone ran away from the president \u2019 s signature legislative accomplishment\u2014the Tax Cut and Jobs Act\u2014on account of its deep unpopularity . ) So while they could mobilize core supporters with appeals to racial threat , they couldn \u2019 t reach those cross-pressured voters , compete with conventional Democratic candidates , or overcome an active and energized Democratic electorate .\nFor further evidence , you can look to Senate races in Michigan , Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Wisconsin . As a candidate , Trump promised to tailor his economic policy to their needs ; as president , he pursued large , upper-income tax cuts and pushed deep cuts to Medicaid and other social insurance programs . The result has been backlash against the GOP as Democrats recover lost ground even in the face of the president \u2019 s racial demagoguery . Some of this is Democratic mobilization against the president and his constant presence in national life , and some of it reflects shifting partisan loyalties among white voters with college degrees .
