    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Former national security adviser Michael Flynn brought the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to President Trump 's inner circle on Friday , promising to give prosecutors information about other senior aides as he pleaded guilty to a charge of lying to the FBI .\nFlynn \u2019 s abrupt guilty plea is the dramatic culmination of an investigation Trump had once asked the FBI to drop . His cooperation means a top adviser in the campaign and the early days of his presidency is now providing evidence in an investigation that has cast a shadow over the president 's first year in office . And it suggests that the investigation remains far from over .\nFlynn is the fourth former Trump aide to face criminal charges in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , but the first to be prosecuted for things that happened during the Trump administration and the first to so directly bring the special counsel 's case to the administration 's door .\nIn court Friday morning , prosecutors prosecutors offered their first hint of the information Flynn might provide , saying that conversations he had with Russia 's U.S. ambassador had been coordinated by a `` senior official of the presidential transition . ''\nIn a court filing made public Friday , prosecutors alleged that Flynn \u201c did willfully and knowingly make materially false , fictitious and fraudulent statements \u201d to FBI agents during an interview on Jan. 24 -- four days after he began serving in the White House -- about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office . Prosecutors charged that he falsely told FBI agents that he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a pending United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements .\nThat call , prosecutors said , was made at the direction of a `` very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team .

President Obama imposed those sanctions Dec. 28 ; the same day , Kislyak contacted Flynn to discuss how the Russian government would respond .\nThe next day , Flynn called a `` senior official of the Presidential Transition Team '' at Trump 's private Mar-a-Lago resort `` to discuss what , if anything , to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. sanctions , '' according to a court filing signed by Flynn and prosecutors . Immediately after that call , Flynn called Kislyak and asked that Russia `` not escalate the situation . ''\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said the following day that his government would not retaliate for the sanctions . Trump praised Putin 's move on Twitter , writing `` I always knew he was very smart ! ''\nWhile incoming presidents traditionally have calls with world leaders during the transition , it is unusual for his aides to begin conducting foreign policy of any kind before the inauguration .\nAfter pleading guilty , Flynn issued a personal statement that said , `` I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong , and , through my faith in God , I am working to set things right .
