What can be done about it? These questions are asked and often answered by Coulson's new PBS TV series School Inc. It's a wonderful three hours, reaching back years to America's first experiments in education and traveling the world to look at schools in Chile, England, Sweden, India and Korea. In Korea, top teachers make millions.\n\nWhy haven't American schools improved? The education establishment says, \"We don't have enough money!\" But American schools spend more per student than other countries. Spending tripled during Coulson's lifetime and class sizes dropped. But test scores stay flat.\n\n\"Schools adopted all sorts of new technologies, from projectors to personal computers to 'smart' whiteboards,\" says Coulson. \"None of these inventions improved outcomes \u2026 Educational quality has been stuck in the era of disco and leisure suits for 40 years, while the rest of the world has passed it by.\"\n\nThe main reason for that is that most schools are controlled by government. Government is a monopoly, and monopolies resist change. Actually, most of us resist change. We don't want to give up the way we've always done things. Certainly, few of us want to work harder, or differently. We get set in our ways.\n\nBut when there is competition, we can't get away with that.

Escalante taught at California's Garfield High School. The student body was, and is, composed of some of the most \"disadvantaged\" students in America. Yet more Garfield High students passed advanced placement calculus tests than did students from Beverly Hills High.\n\nEscalante was the reason. He was simply a better teacher.\n\nCoulson interviewed some of his former students, who said, \"Escalante worked as if his life depended on the success of his students.\"\n\nThe results were beyond belief \u2026 literally.
