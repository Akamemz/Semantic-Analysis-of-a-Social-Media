    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump is likely to sign the border-security legislation finalized Wednesday that would keep the government from closing this weekend , people familiar with his plans said , but he continues to look for ways to supplement the modest funding it contains for barriers .\nMr. Trump said he would take a serious look at the legislation , which includes far less money for barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border than he has demanded , but gave no assurance he would sign it . He said he doesn \u2019 t want to see another government shutdown , while also indicating he continued to seek ways to find more funding for the wall beyond what Congress is allocating .\n\u201c We have got a lot of funds for a lot of other things , \u201d Mr. Trump said , without providing details . \u201c With a wall , they want to be stingy . We have options that most people don \u2019 t really understand. \u201d In the past , Mr. Trump has floated declaring a national emergency to redirect funds to the wall , bypassing Congress .\nDemocrats are expected to challenge any efforts to move money around without congressional approval .\nThe text of the bill was released late Wednesday after lawmakers sorted out some last-minute complications . The biggest snag focused on whether to include back pay for federal contractors to make up for lost compensation during the record-long partial government shutdown that ended last month . Democratic lawmakers supported the back pay , but the White House balked at it .\nLawmakers also debated an extension of the Violence Against Women Act , which provides funding for programs to prevent domestic violence and bolster prosecutions . House Democrats pushed instead to reintroduce later a new version of the bill that would prevent people under protective orders from possessing firearms and would bar evictions of victims of domestic violence based on the actions of abusers .\nWhen negotiations had wrapped up Wednesday night , lawmakers had decided not to include a reauthorization of VAWA or back pay for contractors in the bill , according to a senior Democratic aide .\nThe Senate and House were expected to vote Thursday on the spending package . It is expected to pass both chambers , though it will face opposition from lawmakers on both the left and right ends of the political spectrum .\nThe people familiar with Mr. Trump \u2019 s plans said that unless something unexpected emerged that made the bill less palatable , they expected him to back it . \u201c We \u2019 ll be looking for land mines because you could have that , \u201d the Republican president said Wednesday , referring to the legislation .\nAdministration officials cautioned that no final decision has been made , and that the White House was still reviewing the deal .\nThe deal , backed by congressional leaders in both parties , would fund the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees the border , and a group of other federal agencies through September . It would allocate $ 1.38 billion for 55 miles of physical barriers\u2014including bollard fencing and levee walls , but not concrete walls\u2014along the Rio Grande Valley of the U.S.-Mexico border , according to congressional aides . That marks a far lower funding level than the $ 5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had sought for a wall .\nSome conservative lawmakers and commentators have bashed the deal for not having more wall funding , including Fox News host and Trump adviser Sean Hannity , who called it a \u201c garbage compromise. \u201d But an administration official cast the deal as a win for Mr. Trump \u2019 s border-security agenda .\n\u201c We are a long way from Pelosi \u2019 s $ 1 , \u201d the official said , referring to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) joking last month that she would allot $ 1 for Mr. Trump \u2019 s wall .\nStill , a person close to Mr. Trump expected him to make clear that he isn \u2019 t happy about the bill when he ultimately signs it . Mr. Trump has resigned himself to the fact that lawmakers won \u2019 t agree on more wall funding , the person said , but is confident that he can divert funds from elsewhere in the administration to the wall .\n\u201c As long as he \u2019 s fighting for any mechanism , I would think it plays well , \u201d the person said . \u201c No one in the U.S. gives a crap how you do it.\u2026They don \u2019 t read that part of the stories . \u201d\nIn an interview Wednesday with Fox News , White House press secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to some benefits that the administration sees in the deal , such as that it provides a total of $ 23 billion in funding for the budgets for Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement .\nLike Mr. Trump , she also suggested that the White House could augment the border-wall money provided by Congress through other means . Mr. Trump \u201c and his team have been looking at everything possible to get the funding they need in order to complete the wall , \u201d she said .\nLiberal Democratic lawmakers raised concerns Wednesday over the number of ICE detention beds funded in the bill and ICE \u2019 s continued ability to transfer money to fund more beds than Congress had authorized . Democrats had hoped to place limits on the number of ICE beds .\nRep.
