It is the fidelity to the rule of law of the FBI .\nThe recent revelations of the receipt by Clinton of a Special Access Program email , as well as cut and pasted summaries of state secrets on her server and on her BlackBerry nearly guarantee that the FBI will recommend that the Department of Justice convene a grand jury and seek her indictment for espionage . Here is the backstory .\nIt seems that every week , more information comes to light about Clinton \u2019 s grave legal woes . Her worries are in two broad categories : One is her well-documented failure to safeguard state secrets and the other is her probable use of her position as secretary of state to advance financially her husband \u2019 s charitable foundation .

It is apparently not new to the FBI , but it is new to the public .\nAmong the data that the FBI either found on the Clinton server or acquired from the State Department via its responses to Freedom of Information Act requests is a top-secret email that has been denominated Special Access Program . Top secret is the highest category of state secrets ( the other categories are confidential and secret ) , and of the sub-parts of top secret , SAP is the most sensitive .\nSAP is clothed in such secrecy that it can not be received or opened accidentally . Clinton -- who ensured all of her governmental emails came to her through her husband \u2019 s server , a nonsecure nongovernmental venue -- could only have received or viewed it from that server after inputting certain codes .

Yet , Clinton has suggested that she is hopelessly digitally inept and may not have known what she was doing . This constitutes an attempted plausible deniability to the charge of failing to safeguard state secrets .\nBut in this sensitive area of the law , plausible deniability is not an available defense ; no judge would permit the assertion of it in legal filings or in a courtroom , and no lawyer would permit a client to make the assertion .\nThis is so for two reasons . First , failure to safeguard state secrets is a crime for which the government need not prove intent . The failure can be done negligently . Thus , plausible deniability is actually an admission of negligence and , hence in this case , an admission of guilt , not a denial .\nSecond , Clinton signed an oath under penalty of perjury on Jan. 22 , 2009 , her first full day as secretary of state . In that oath , she acknowledged that she had received a full FBI briefing on the lawfully required care and keeping of state secrets . Her briefing and her oath specified that the obligation to safeguard state secrets is absolute -- it can not be avoided or evaded by forgetfulness or any other form of negligence , and that negligence can bring prosecution .\nWhat type of data is typically protected by the SAP denomination ?
