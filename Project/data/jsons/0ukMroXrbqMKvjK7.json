Lewis is a leader of the civil rights movement and a 30-year veteran of the House of Representatives ; he \u2019 s a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient and an American hero .\nBut on some level , Donald Trump \u2019 s tweets lashing out at Lewis ( who had called the president-elect \u201c illegitimate \u201d in an interview with Chuck Todd on Friday ) are totally expected , even inevitable . It \u2019 s what Lewis has been dealing with all his life .\nCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district , which is in horrible shape and falling apart ( not to ...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 14 , 2017\nmention crime infested ) rather than falsely complaining about the election results . All talk , talk , talk - no action or results . Sad ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 14 , 2017\nCongressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S . I can use all the help I can get ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 15 , 2017\nThe thing is that while John Lewis has been engaged in action for decades , the actions he \u2019 s been engaged in haven \u2019 t been respected either . He \u2019 s a student of nonviolence who \u2019 s been beaten up dozens of times ; a voting rights activist who , even just a few years after the Voting Rights Act passed , found himself needing to argue that it was still needed .\nLewis has never been a radical . Anti-segregation , voting rights , black political leadership \u2014 these are all the sort of goals that everyone , in 2017 , can get behind . But every step of the way , he \u2019 s been concern-trolled , dismissed , or scolded : told that he is focusing on the wrong thing , or trying to do the right thing but going about it the wrong way .\nBut there \u2019 s a fine line , when an activist is being scolded by those in power , between denunciation and delegitimization .\nTrump \u2019 s tweets appeared to be totally impulsive ; it \u2019 s practically routine , at this point , for the president-elect to fire off some early-morning tweets complaining about someone who criticized him the day before , and Lewis was simply Saturday \u2019 s chosen target . But the way that Trump attacked Lewis \u2014 and the way the president-elect has talked about black communities , politicians , and activists throughout his campaign and pre-presidency \u2014 is part of a pattern of delegitimizing dissent in general , and black dissent in particular .\nTrump \u2019 s tweets weren \u2019 t exactly accusing Lewis of not having accomplished anything \u2014 even though that \u2019 s what the \u201c all talk , talk , talk \u2014 no action or results \u201d made it sound like .\nThe three tweets , taken together , make it clear : Trump \u2019 s problem with Lewis is that he \u2019 s not focusing on the issues Trump thinks he should care about . As far as Trump is concerned , Lewis \u2019 s opinions can be safely ignored because his congressional district ( which includes most of the city of Atlanta , as well as some of its most affluent suburbs ) is supposedly \u201c falling apart , \u201d \u201c crime-infested , \u201d \u201c burning. \u201d If Lewis really cared about America , he \u2019 d fix that problem first .\nThe argument Trump is making , though not in so many words , is : Well , John Lewis , what about black-on-black crime ?\nPar for the course with Trump , this argument bears little relation to the facts . Atlanta is the heart of the black middle class in America . And while the city has a relatively high violent crime rate , it is almost certainly not as dangerous as Donald Trump ( who routinely claims that America \u2019 s murder rate is at a 50-year high , and claims that black Americans \u201c can \u2019 t walk out the door without getting shot \u201d ) thinks it is .\nThis is how we feel about @ repjohnlewis down here in the GA 5th , a district Donald Trump thinks the congressman is failing # Defendthe5th pic.twitter.com/qZUgrGBBtc \u2014 Jeb Boone ( @ JebBoone ) January 14 , 2017\nBut this is the typical way Trump talks about black communities . His way of expressing sympathy for black America is to lament the fact that they live in crime-ridden hellholes due to the supposed neglect of politicians like John Lewis .\nTime and again , he conflates black residents with the \u201c inner city , \u201d and characterizes inner cities as a lawless , crumbling dump \u2014 not to mention a place where all votes are fraudulently cast . It \u2019 s a characterization that resembles actual black America ( or increasingly nonblack urban America ) less than it resembles 1980s dystopias like Escape From New York and Demolition Man . And that \u2019 s exactly the point .\nTrump \u2019 s rhetoric isn \u2019 t really for the people who actually live in cities or in black communities . It \u2019 s for white suburbanites who , because they deliberately avoid cities , haven \u2019 t updated their idea of what cities are like beyond Reagan-era stereotypes .\nIf you believe that black Americans really are in danger of being gunned down by criminals every time they open their doors , of course you \u2019 d be baffled that politicians from black communities ever talk about anything else \u2014 and a little upset with those politicians for ignoring the real issues when they do . You might conclude that they don \u2019 t really care about the disorder plaguing their communities .\nBut of course , the same line of thinking is what leads people to characterize black-led protests as themselves a form of disorder . The assumption that black communities are inherently unruly places makes it easy to fail to distinguish between a Black Lives Matter \u201c protest \u201d and a \u201c riot \u201d ; to assume that anything law enforcement officers are doing in black neighborhoods is needed to keep the peace , and therefore any complaints about it are ungrateful or even dangerous .\nDonald Trump \u2019 s nomination speech conflated Black Lives Matter protests with the Dallas police shootings . His nominee for attorney general , Jeff Sessions , emphasized during his confirmation hearings this week that criticism of police departments ( by activists and the Obama administration alike ) has led to a spike in violent crime in cities like Chicago and Baltimore .\nThe upshot is that there is no such thing as a legitimate political action that comes from black communities . Speech ( as long as it challenges the status quo ) is irrelevant . Voting is fraudulent ; elected leaders are illegitimate . Protest is disorderly or anarchistic .\nIt \u2019 s a bind with which John Lewis is intimately familiar .\nJohn Lewis was committed to nonviolent protest back when nonviolence was seen as a provocation\nJohn Lewis was a student of nonviolence . In 1958 , as a Baptist seminary student in Nashville , he started attending nonviolence workshops led by James Lawson ; \u201c these workshops dealt with the question of philosophy , the discipline of nonviolence , the whole history of the struggle in India led by Ghandi [ sic ] and his attempt to organize in South Africa\u2014building it on the whole idea of Christian faith , \u201d as he later explained to interviewers from the Southern Oral History Program in 1973 .\nIn the story of the civil rights movement that most people ( especially most white people ) have in 2017 , that puts Lewis on the \u201c right side \u201d of the movement \u2014 the nonviolent protests of the early 1960s , focused on desegregation and voting rights , rather than the \u201c radical militants \u201d of the late 1960s . ( Indeed , Lewis left the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1965 , after Stokely Carmichael was elected to lead it , because he felt the group was no longer as strongly committed to nonviolence as Lewis himself was . )\nBut while that distinction seems perfectly clear and sensible in 2017 \u2014 a clear demarcation of a \u201c right \u201d and \u201c wrong \u201d way to take action , and right and wrong things to take action about \u2014 it \u2019 s hardly a distinction that existed at the time . Nonviolent protests were met with violence from white civilians and law enforcement alike .\nWhen Lewis took part in lunch counter sit-ins in Nashville in late 1959 and early 1960 , he told the oral history interviewers , white teenagers would pull \u201c students off the seats or put lighted cigarettes down their backs , that type of thing . We continued to sit . \u201d\nINTERVIEWERS : Was any of that done to you ? JOHN LEWIS : I was hit , but never a lighted cigarette or anything like that . INTERVIEWERS : Was it painful ? LEWIS : Oh , yes . We refused to strike back .\nAfter one of those incidents , Lewis and the other student protesters were arrested . It was Lewis \u2019 s first arrest ( he had just turned 20 ) ; there would be over 40 more in the course of his career .\nIn retrospect , everyone loves the nonviolence of the early 1960s civil rights movement . At the time , though , the movement \u2019 s insistence on nonviolent mass mobilization was seen by most of white America \u2014 even outside the South \u2014 as ineffective at best and unhelpful at worst . A plurality of Americans had an unfavorable view of the 1963 March on Washington ; Martin Luther King Jr. \u2019 s favorability ratings declined throughout the 1960s . And even Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy tried to push civil rights groups , in 1962 , to stop holding protests for a while and focus on voter registration instead . ( The NAACP agreed ; SNCC , led at the time by Lewis , did not . )\nLewis got his skull cracked open in the name of law and order\nOpposition to desegregation wasn \u2019 t just expressed as outright white supremacy \u2014 it was a defense of \u201c law and order. \u201d John Lewis got arrested dozens of times because he broke dozens of laws \u2014 either laws of segregation themselves , or laws ( often ad hoc injunctions ) specifically designed to stymie black activism .\n55 years ago today , I was arrested in the Jackson , MS bus station for using a `` whites-only '' restroom . # goodtrouble pic.twitter.com/v8zeqfVl75 \u2014 John Lewis ( @ repjohnlewis ) May 24 , 2016\nWhen Lewis spent 37 days at Parchman Farm , the infamous Mississippi prison , during the 1961 Freedom Rides , it was ( as he characterized it in a 2014 tweet ) for using a \u201c white \u201d restroom .\nWhen he , King and others started the Selma Campaign at the beginning of 1965 ( dramatized in the 2015 movie Selma ) it wasn \u2019 t just because of massive resistance on the part of white poll workers to registering black voters \u2014 it was because of an injunction that had been passed prohibiting three or more people from gathering together and talking about civil rights or voting . ( During the campaign , Alabama Gov . George Wallace added an injunction banning nighttime protests in the cities of Selma and Marion . )\nThese laws were unjust and unequally enforced , but they were laws . When Jimmie Lee Jackson was killed in Marion during a protest , he was killed as a lawbreaker . When Lewis had his skull fractured by law enforcement officers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7 , 1965 \u2014 \u201c Bloody Sunday \u201d \u2014 while trying to march from Selma to Montgomery , he was in violation of an order to disperse .\nLewis led the marchers back to a church and ( in the words of the New York Times \u2019 s article from the time ) \u201c made a speech to the crowd huddled angry and weeping in the sanctuary. \u201d Only then did he go to the hospital to get his skull patched up .\n\u201c Bloody Sunday \u201d is generally regarded as the moral high point of the civil rights movement , the point where public opinion shifted decisively in favor of voting rights for black Americans . ( Lewis said in the early 1970s that \u201c If there is any single event that gave birth to the Voter Rights Act , it was the Selma effort . \u201d )\nDallas County Sheriff Jim Clark went to his grave denying anyone was hurt on the Edmund Pettus Bridge ( he claimed they \u201c all fell down in one big swoop \u201d and \u201c some might have hit their head when they fell down \u201d ) . In 2006 , he said that he \u2019 d do it all over again if he had to : \u201c I did what I thought was right to uphold the law . \u201d\nLewis has spent the past five decades getting told he \u2019 s doing black leadership wrong\nFocusing on Lewis \u2019 s role in the civil rights movement runs the risk of making it seem like he \u2019 s just been coasting since then \u2014 like he \u2019 d stopped contributing to American history after the age of 25 . But the more accurate way to think about it is that Lewis has spent the rest of his career trying to persuade other people that the fight for civil rights wasn \u2019 t won in 1965 , and other people haven \u2019 t always been as willing to listen . Lewis \u2019 s actions at the beginning of his career have been lionized \u2014 often as a way to diminish the significance of the problems he \u2019 s identified through the next five decades .\nIn the early 1970s , Lewis served as head of the Voter Education Project \u2014 turning it into an independent activist organization dedicated to registering black Southern voters . ( At one point , when Mississippi kicked all voters off the rolls and forced them to re-register , Lewis and Julian Bond held 39 voter mobilization events in 25 Mississippi counties \u2014 over the course of six days . ) But as early as 1971 \u2014 six years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 he found himself having to argue that it was still necessary .\n\u201c We have to look beyond the glowing reports of a new South , \u201d he told the House Judiciary Committee during a 1971 hearing :\nWe have to recognize the fallacies of those who would tell us that Federal registrars and observers are no longer needed . We can not allow ourselves to be duped into believing that , in these so-called new and changing times , the Voting Rights Act is no longer needed . The figures of unregistered black voters indicate there is still a need for active enforcement of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 active enforcement which we have not seen in some time .\nLewis testified before Congress on the need for the VRA again in 1975 \u2014 and again in 2013 , the year after the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision in Shelby County v. Holder struck down the section of the Voting Rights Act giving the federal government automatic oversight of voting regulations in certain ( mostly Southern ) areas . The argument made by Chief Justice John Roberts in the Shelby County case wasn \u2019 t dissimilar to the \u201c new South \u201d arguments Lewis was arguing against in 1971 \u2014 that the law had served its purpose , and social change had made discrimination a thing of the past .\nFor nearly 40 years , Lewis has been an elected official ( first as an Atlanta city council member , and then , starting in 1986 , as a member of the House ) ; in other words , he \u2019 s followed the injunction often given to activists that if they want to really change things , they should go into electoral politics . And indeed , he ( like many black politicians in the 1980s ) took the sort of \u201c tough \u201d stance on criminal justice that Trump is faulting him for not taking today ( he once challenged Julian Bond to take a drug test when the two ran against each other for Congress in 1986 ) .\nHis role in the House has been less one of legislative leadership than moral leadership ; he \u2019 s been called the \u201c conscience of the Congress. \u201d To a large extent , this is because he \u2019 s now accepted to be on the right side of history ; it \u2019 s no longer controversial to believe that when Lewis was beaten down for refusing to get off the Edmund Pettus Bridge , he was doing the right thing even though he was blocking traffic .\nAs Lewis himself has taken to putting it , the trouble he got into in the 1960s was \u201c good trouble , necessary trouble. \u201d And history has recognized it as such .\nBut when Lewis has stepped into issues that are controversial , it \u2019 s become clear that deference to the \u201c conscience of the Congress \u201d only goes so far \u2014 that there \u2019 s still a tendency to dismiss people for expressing dissent the \u201c wrong way , \u201d even if they \u2019 re Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients .\nLewis was one of the leaders of the 2016 House Democratic \u201c sit-in \u201d over gun violence after the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . In Trump \u2019 s framework , it was \u201c talk \u201d instead of \u201c action \u201d \u2014 the sit-in didn \u2019 t succeed , insofar as Congress didn \u2019 t pass the bill Democrats were fighting for .\nBut the reaction by House Republicans proved that \u201c talk \u201d can nonetheless be threatening or even dangerous . Republicans shut off the cameras in the House chamber ; they met with the sergeant-at-arms after the sit-in to consider punishing Democrats for violating House rules ; and they subsequently passed a rule banning cellphone cameras on the House floor .\nLewis saw it as # GoodTrouble ( which he turned into a hashtag for the occasion , in response to the criticism ) ; his opponents saw it as a threat .\nBy the same token , Lewis has been unfettered in his criticism of Trump on moral grounds . In March 2016 \u2014 after Trump canceled a rally in Chicago and then claimed it was because of violent protests \u2014 Lewis brought back a refrain associated with criticism of Sen. Joe McCarthy :\n. @ realDonaldTrump Have you no sense of decency , sir ? \u2014 John Lewis ( @ repjohnlewis ) March 12 , 2016\nCalling a president-elect \u201c illegitimate \u201d is certainly not the sort of thing that members of the House of Representatives typically do . It \u2019 s controversial . It \u2019 s causing trouble . But Lewis knows that . Lewis believes he \u2019 s making trouble for the right reasons : good trouble .\nYou \u2019 d think that Trump , a negotiator who understands PR as an arena and often has little in the way of scruples about the right way to win , would understand and respect Lewis \u2019 s skills in using protest to dramatize dissent .\nDonald Trump is a tremendously thin-skinned man . He doesn \u2019 t tend to respect dissent of any kind when it \u2019 s directed against him .\nThis isn \u2019 t to imply that Trump \u2019 s tweets criticizing Lewis were part of some sort of strategic crackdown . They weren \u2019 t strategic . They were impulsive . But Trump , and those around him , has an unsettling tendency to see dissent as inherently illegitimate \u2014 sour grapes at best and sedition at worst .\nTrump \u2019 s stab at Lewis comes at the end of a week in which Trump staffers have threatened to ban a critical journalist from future press events , while allies have called to prevent \u201c mainstream \u201d reporters from even covering him as president . Some Democratic members of the House aren \u2019 t getting tickets to Trump \u2019 s inauguration .\nAnd while Trump hasn \u2019 t spoken out yet about the plans for a massive \u201c women \u2019 s march \u201d the day after his inauguration , it \u2019 s hard to shake off the memory of his reaction to the protests spurred by his election : calling them \u201c very unfair \u201d and claiming protesters were paid .\nThere is no correct way to dissent , in this framework . Speak out about the \u201c wrong \u201d thing , and it \u2019 s \u201c all talk \u201d ; do something , and you \u2019 re a threat .\nIt \u2019 s an extremely uncomfortable situation for a dissenter to be in . But there are worse role models for such a dissenter to have than John Lewis . John Lewis has been in that bind all his life .",

(The NAACP agreed; SNCC, led at the time by Lewis, did not.)\n\nLewis got his skull cracked open in the name of law and order\n\nOpposition to desegregation wasn\u2019t just expressed as outright white supremacy \u2014 it was a defense of \u201claw and order.\u201d John Lewis got arrested dozens of times because he broke dozens of laws \u2014 either laws of segregation themselves, or laws (often ad hoc injunctions) specifically designed to stymie black activism.\n\n55 years ago today, I was arrested in the Jackson, MS bus station for using a \"whites-only\" restroom. #goodtrouble pic.twitter.com/v8zeqfVl75 \u2014 John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) May 24, 2016\n\nWhen Lewis spent 37 days at Parchman Farm, the infamous Mississippi prison, during the 1961 Freedom Rides, it was (as he characterized it in a 2014 tweet) for using a \u201cwhite\u201d restroom.\n\nWhen he, King and others started the Selma Campaign at the beginning of 1965 (dramatized in the 2015 movie Selma) it wasn\u2019t just because of massive resistance on the part of white poll workers to registering black voters \u2014 it was because of an injunction that had been passed prohibiting three or more people from gathering together and talking about civil rights or voting. (During the campaign, Alabama Gov. George Wallace added an injunction banning nighttime protests in the cities of Selma and Marion.)\n\nThese laws were unjust and unequally enforced, but they were laws. When Jimmie Lee Jackson was killed in Marion during a protest, he was killed as a lawbreaker. When Lewis had his skull fractured by law enforcement officers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965 \u2014 \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d \u2014 while trying to march from Selma to Montgomery, he was in violation of an order to disperse.\n\nLewis led the marchers back to a church and (in the words of the New York Times\u2019s article from the time) \u201cmade a speech to the crowd huddled angry and weeping in the sanctuary.\u201d Only then did he go to the hospital to get his skull patched up.\n\n\u201cBloody Sunday\u201d is generally regarded as the moral high point of the civil rights movement, the point where public opinion shifted decisively in favor of voting rights for black Americans. (Lewis said in the early 1970s that \u201cIf there is any single event that gave birth to the Voter Rights Act, it was the Selma effort.\u201d)\n\nDallas County Sheriff Jim Clark went to his grave denying anyone was hurt on the Edmund Pettus Bridge (he claimed they \u201call fell down in one big swoop\u201d and \u201csome might have hit their head when they fell down\u201d). In 2006, he said that he\u2019d do it all over again if he had to: \u201cI did what I thought was right to uphold the law.\u201d\n\nLewis has spent the past five decades getting told he\u2019s doing black leadership wrong\n\nFocusing on Lewis\u2019s role in the civil rights movement runs the risk of making it seem like he\u2019s just been coasting since then \u2014 like he\u2019d stopped contributing to American history after the age of 25. But the more accurate way to think about it is that Lewis has spent the rest of his career trying to persuade other people that the fight for civil rights wasn\u2019t won in 1965, and other people haven\u2019t always been as willing to listen. Lewis\u2019s actions at the beginning of his career have been lionized \u2014 often as a way to diminish the significance of the problems he\u2019s identified through the next five decades.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lewis served as head of the Voter Education Project \u2014 turning it into an independent activist organization dedicated to registering black Southern voters. (At one point, when Mississippi kicked all voters off the rolls and forced them to re-register, Lewis and Julian Bond held 39 voter mobilization events in 25 Mississippi counties \u2014 over the course of six days.) But as early as 1971 \u2014 six years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 he found himself having to argue that it was still necessary.\n\n\u201cWe have to look beyond the glowing reports of a new South,\u201d he told the House Judiciary Committee during a 1971 hearing:\n\nWe have to recognize the fallacies of those who would tell us that Federal registrars and observers are no longer needed. We cannot allow ourselves to be duped into believing that, in these so-called new and changing times, the Voting Rights Act is no longer needed. The figures of unregistered black voters indicate there is still a need for active enforcement of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 active enforcement which we have not seen in some time.\n\nLewis testified before Congress on the need for the VRA again in 1975 \u2014 and again in 2013, the year after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby County v. Holder struck down the section of the Voting Rights Act giving the federal government automatic oversight of voting regulations in certain (mostly Southern) areas. The argument made by Chief Justice John Roberts in the Shelby County case wasn\u2019t dissimilar to the \u201cnew South\u201d arguments Lewis was arguing against in 1971 \u2014 that the law had served its purpose, and social change had made discrimination a thing of the past.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Lewis has been an elected official (first as an Atlanta city council member, and then, starting in 1986, as a member of the House); in other words, he\u2019s followed the injunction often given to activists that if they want to really change things, they should go into electoral politics. And indeed, he (like many black politicians in the 1980s) took the sort of \u201ctough\u201d stance on criminal justice that Trump is faulting him for not taking today (he once challenged Julian Bond to take a drug test when the two ran against each other for Congress in 1986).\n\nHis role in the House has been less one of legislative leadership than moral leadership; he\u2019s been called the \u201cconscience of the Congress.\u201d To a large extent, this is because he\u2019s now accepted to be on the right side of history; it\u2019s no longer controversial to believe that when Lewis was beaten down for refusing to get off the Edmund Pettus Bridge, he was doing the right thing even though he was blocking traffic.\n\nAs Lewis himself has taken to putting it, the trouble he got into in the 1960s was \u201cgood trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d And history has recognized it as such.\n\nBut when Lewis has stepped into issues that are controversial, it\u2019s become clear that deference to the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d only goes so far \u2014 that there\u2019s still a tendency to dismiss people for expressing dissent the \u201cwrong way,\u201d even if they\u2019re Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients.\n\nLewis was one of the leaders of the 2016 House Democratic \u201csit-in\u201d over gun violence after the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. In Trump\u2019s framework, it was \u201ctalk\u201d instead of \u201caction\u201d \u2014 the sit-in didn\u2019t succeed, insofar as Congress didn\u2019t pass the bill Democrats were fighting for.\n\nBut the reaction by House Republicans proved that \u201ctalk\u201d can nonetheless be threatening or even dangerous. Republicans shut off the cameras in the House chamber; they met with the sergeant-at-arms after the sit-in to consider punishing Democrats for violating House rules; and they subsequently passed a rule banning cellphone cameras on the House floor.\n\nLewis saw it as #GoodTrouble (which he turned into a hashtag for the occasion, in response to the criticism); his opponents saw it as a threat.\n\nBy the same token, Lewis has been unfettered in his criticism of Trump on moral grounds. In March 2016 \u2014 after Trump canceled a rally in Chicago and then claimed it was because of violent protests \u2014 Lewis brought back a refrain associated with criticism of Sen. Joe McCarthy:\n\n.@realDonaldTrump Have you no sense of decency, sir? \u2014 John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) March 12, 2016\n\nCalling a president-elect \u201cillegitimate\u201d is certainly not the sort of thing that members of the House of Representatives typically do. It\u2019s controversial. It\u2019s causing trouble. But Lewis knows that. Lewis believes he\u2019s making trouble for the right reasons: good trouble.\n\nTrump\u2019s disturbing tendency to delegitimize dissent\n\nYou\u2019d think that Trump, a negotiator who understands PR as an arena and often has little in the way of scruples about the right way to win, would understand and respect Lewis\u2019s skills in using protest to dramatize dissent.\n\nNo.\n\nDonald Trump is a tremendously thin-skinned man. He doesn\u2019t tend to respect dissent of any kind when it\u2019s directed against him.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to imply that Trump\u2019s tweets criticizing Lewis were part of some sort of strategic crackdown. They weren\u2019t strategic. They were impulsive. But Trump, and those around him, has an unsettling tendency to see dissent as inherently illegitimate \u2014 sour grapes at best and sedition at worst.\n\nTrump\u2019s stab at Lewis comes at the end of a week in which Trump staffers have threatened to ban a critical journalist from future press events, while allies have called to prevent \u201cmainstream\u201d reporters from even covering him as president. Some Democratic members of the House aren\u2019t getting tickets to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAnd while Trump hasn\u2019t spoken out yet about the plans for a massive \u201cwomen\u2019s march\u201d the day after his inauguration, it\u2019s hard to shake off the memory of his reaction to the protests spurred by his election: calling them \u201cvery unfair\u201d and claiming protesters were paid.\n\nThere is no correct way to dissent, in this framework. Speak out about the \u201cwrong\u201d thing, and it\u2019s \u201call talk\u201d; do something, and you\u2019re a threat.\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely uncomfortable situation for a dissenter to be in. But there are worse role models for such a dissenter to have than John Lewis. John Lewis has been in that bind all his life.",
