From the start, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes faced a steep climb in trying to unseat five-term Sen. Mitch McConnell, who hopes to become majority leader in January.\n\nPundits like to cite McConnell's relatively low popularity in Kentucky. But that ignores the extreme unlikeliness of Grimes getting votes from conservatives who find McConnell too accommodating and moderate.\n\nObama lost Kentucky by a whopping 23 percentage points. A Grimes victory would rank among the greatest upsets in modern politics.\n\n___\n\nWHAT ARE SIGNS OF A STRONG REPUBLICAN NIGHT?\n\nIf Republican nominees run ahead of expectations in Virginia and New Hampshire \u2014 even if they lose \u2014 it will be a bad sign for Democrats elsewhere.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is expected to cruise past Republican Ed Gillespie. If Gillespie stays within, say, 5 or 6 percentage points, it could suggest tepid support for Democrats.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Democrats have always assumed Sen. Jeanne Shaheen would hold off Republican Scott Brown, a former senator from Massachusetts.\n\nIf Brown keeps the race razor-close, it's a worrisome sign for Democrats. If Brown defeats Shaheen, Democrats can start packing their bags for the minority side of the aisle.\n\n___\n\nWHICH WAY WILL NORTH CAROLINA TIP?\n\nNorth Carolina is one of the nation's most closely divided states politically. Aside from Indiana, where Obama hardly tried in 2012, it's the only state he won once and lost once.\n\nFittingly, the state's Senate race has stayed relentlessly close.\n\nFirst-term Democrat Kay Hagan proudly calls herself the Senate's most middle-of-the-road member. She said her GOP challenger, Thom Tillis, speaker of the state House, led a conservative revolution that veered too far right for the centrist state.\n\nThis race may be too close for an early call Tuesday night. But both parties will watch intensely, not only for the Hagan-Tillis outcome, but also for hints of where a moderating southern state might trend in the next presidential race.\n\n___\n\nCAN DEMOCRATS GRAB GEORGIA'S GOP SEAT WITHOUT A RUNOFF?\n\nGeorgia Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue have made a few rookie mistakes in vying for the seat that Republican Saxby Chambliss is leaving, but they ran well-funded campaigns.\n\nObama lost Georgia by 7 percentage points, and it's seen as a Republican state that might reach toss-up status in few years. A Nunn victory would vastly improve Democrats' hopes of keeping the Senate majority. A Perdue win would let Republicans sigh in relief.\n\nBut the results might not be known for two months. With a third-party candidate running, a Jan. 6 runoff between Nunn and Perdue is possible. If that runoff decides which party controls the Senate, Georgia will see campaign spending like never before.\n\n___\n\nWILL SENATE CONTROL BE IN DOUBT FOR DAYS OR WEEKS?\n\nEven without a Georgia runoff, it's possible that Senate control will be in doubt when most Americans go to bed Tuesday night.\n\nA Dec. 6 runoff in Louisiana seems likely.\n\nThe Alaska race between Democratic Sen. Mark Begich and Republican Dan Sullivan could be so close that the final tally could arrive with the East Coast's sunrise Wednesday, or even later.\n\nLate results from Louisiana and Alaska won't determine the Senate's control, however, if Republicans do well elsewhere.\n\nAssuming they don't lose in Georgia, Kentucky or Kansas, Republicans could secure the Senate majority with three victories among these competitive states: Arkansas, North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado and New Hampshire.",
