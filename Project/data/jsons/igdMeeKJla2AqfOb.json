    "content": "Well , if you \u2019 re one of those out there who has thus far failed to see the dominance of Vladimir Putin in the Putin/Obama relationship \u2026 the light surely must be shining now . In the last 24 hours our Dear Ruler has managed to show not only America , but the rest of the world , just how weak he is on the world stage .\nA bit of a recap here to show you what kind of a bind Obama was in :\n\u00b7 Obama goes off-teleprompter ( always a dangerous thing ) and comes up with this \u201c red line \u201d gaff . He is then on the record as saying that Assad will be dealt with harshly if he dares to use chemical weapons .\n\u00b7 Assad uses ( or at least Obama and Kerry say he used ) chemical weapons against his own people .\n\u00b7 Obama realizes how badly he screwed up with his \u201c red line \u201d comment . His credibility , whatever is left of it , is on the line .\n\u00b7 Obama seeks help from Great Britain . For the first time since 1792 the British Parliament refuses to go along with a request from the Prime Minister to use force . Obama is in this on his own .\n\u00b7 Obama needs someone to stand with him on this , so he tells the nation he will seek an approval vote for the Congress . It soon becomes clear the congress is not going along . The Senate\u2026maybe\u2026but not the house . Obama is feeling even more lonely and exposed .\n\u00b7 Obama calls in the campaign team , Plouffe et al . It \u2019 s not policy he \u2019 s looking for , it \u2019 s words . They tell him to tell the world that the red line isn \u2019 t really his . Fail .\n\u00b7 Virtually all polls taken of the American people show strong opposition to Obama \u2019 s planned attack on Syria .\nSo \u2026 here \u2019 s how I see the developments of the last few days . Either it \u2019 s all very simple , or I \u2019 m just simple-minded . ( Sorry , we \u2019 re not going to take a poll on that . )\nPutin ( background \u2013 ass-kicking KGB operative ) sees a way to take advantage of this situation to both embarrass and establish a stronger dominance over Obama ( background \u2013 pot-smoking community organizer ) . Putin heard John Kerry make a bit of a mistake at a presser . Kerry is asked what Assad can do to avoid an attack . The Poodle suggests that Assad could turn over his chemical weapons . The White House immediately refutes the idea , and Kerry \u2019 s handlers start trying to walk the comment back . But Putin was listening \u2026 and he makes his move .\nPutin , loyal to his primary goal here is to keep his pal Assad in power , immediately seizes on Kerry \u2019 s idea and makes it a firm proposal . Just that quickly Putin takes control .\nNow Obama sees a way out . He knows that Putin is controlling the situation here , but at least now he can avoid an embarrassing congressional \u201c no \u201d vote , the first in American history . But hmmmmmm . Maybe Obama can get some of his grove back here . So he tells us that he was actually talking about this plan for Assad to give up his chemical weapons when he was meeting with Putin last week ! Yeah \u2026 sure .\nSo\u2026Here we are . Harry Reid has already put off the Senate vote . After tonight \u2019 s speech by 0bama Reid will probably announce that the vote is postponed indefinitely . The House may go ahead with a vote , but in light of Putin \u2019 s little parlay that vote will be cast as nothing more than an attempt to embarrass Obama .\nAn agreement will be reached between the ass-kicker , the community organizer and the gasser for Syria to turn over \u201c all \u201d of its chemical weapons . Of course \u201c all \u201d of the weapons will not be turned over . There will be inspections , but Putin will work with Assad to make sure the inspections are not too thorough . In the end Assad will keep a good portion of those chemical weapons , and Putin will supply him with even more arms .\nThe violence in Syria will continue , though the rebels will be dispirited . In time Assad will once again use whatever chemical weapons he retained to keep the rebels at bay if that becomes necessary . But wait ! How can Assad use these weapons and not as much as admit that he didn \u2019 t turn them all over to the United Nations ? Well , that one is easy . He \u2019 ll use the weapons and tell the world \u201c See ! I told you I didn \u2019 t use those weapons in the first place ! You didn \u2019 t believe me . Now I gave up my chemical weapons\u2026yet they \u2019 re still being used against the rebels ! This just proves , as I said , that the rebel factions have these weapons and are using them and blaming it all on me ! \u201d",
