    "content": "If they weren \u2019 t trying to destroy the president , Democrats would have to focus on an agenda most Americans don \u2019 t support .\nBy 1968 , voters had tired of the failed Great Society of Lyndon Johnson . Four years later , the 1972 Nixon reelection re-emphasized that a doubled-down McGovern liberalism was even less of a viable agenda .\nIn that context , in 1974 , obsessing on Watergate and a demonized Nixon were wise liberal alternatives to running on a positive left-wing vision , given the growing conservative backlash of the 1970s .\nAfter Watergate and the Ford pardon , Jimmy Carter squeaked to a close victory and a one-term presidency \u2014 before the country tired of his strident liberalism poorly cloaked in conservative clothing . Bill Clinton \u2019 s third-way centrism eventually was a winning Democratic alternative to regain the presidency \u2014 albeit with help from two Ross Perot third-party candidacies . Given these historical reminders , the current efforts at Trump character assassination may be the best \u2014 or only \u2014 progressive pathway back to political power .\nIn the last few days , the Democratic party lost its fourth special House election ; most of the four were billed in advance as likely negative referenda on the contentious first six months of the Trump presidency . Post facto , the uniformly unwelcomed results were written off as idiosyncratic outliers of no importance .\nShortly before the Georgia election , a hard-left-wing killer attacked the players at a congressional baseball practice , intent on the assassination of Republican legislators , whom he had targeted on his hit list . The shooter was foiled , but not before seriously wounding Steve Scalise , the current Republican majority whip in the House .\nThe two events in saner times might have prompted introspection about why the Democrats keep losing elections and why a hard-core progressive supporter would seek to assassinate key Republican leaders . Indeed , for a brief moment , there were calls on both sides of the aisle to scale back inflammatory rhetoric that in theory might push such politicized would-be shooters over the edge . One might have hoped that self-reflective Democrats could begin to grasp why voters distrusted them more than they feared Trump .\nSuch moments quickly vanished . Progressives saw any remedies to identity politics as worse than the disease of electoral defeat . Elizabeth Warren , with her trademark rancor , was once again talking about Republican \u201c blood money \u201d \u2014 as if her opponents in the Congress were legislative assassins rather than the recent targets of such . An increasingly addled Hillary Clinton ( she had loudly joined the \u201c Resistance \u201d ) accused the GOP of becoming the \u201c death party , \u201d reminding the country why progressive fanatics such as James Hodgkinson might think rifle fire is the only answer to conservatives who traffic in blood .\nMeanwhile , another day , another Hollywood celebrity dreaming of , or advocating , the assassination of Donald Trump : This time a disturbed Johnny Depp ( playing the role of Kathy Griffin or Snoop Dogg ) mused out loud about repeating a John Wilkes Booth\u2013style shooting . Since January , left-wing pundits and celebrities have alluded that Trump might be decapitated , stabbed by a mob , shot , punched , hit with a bat , blown up , strung up , and flipped off . Incineration and drowning are about the last modes of Trump mayhem left unsaid .\nBarack Obama , amid the assassination chic and the obscenity of key Democrats such as Kamala Harris , Tom Perez , and Kirsten Gillibrand , recently remonstrated about the evils of inequality and the need for more diversity \u2014 at $ 10,000 a minute to largely white , Wall Street audiences , while whining about the ongoing recalibration of his failed Obamacare project . That is what passes for 21st-century progressive community organizing .\nLeft unsaid was that Obama had virtually destroyed the Democratic party , which during his tenure lost more than 1,000 state and local elections and both the House and the Senate . Obama left a personal legacy of a party agenda that had no popular support , an incoming Republican presidency , a conservative Supreme Court , a tenure to be systematically overturned , and a one-time progressive electoral paradigm that could work only for himself while imploding almost any other candidate foolish enough to try to replicate it .\nOf the Democratic policies once envisioned under Bill Clinton , few are left .\nIt is said that Democrats are in an existential crisis because of their obsessions with Donald Trump \u2014 suing over the election , trying to subvert the Electoral College , dreaming of impeachment and the 25th Amendment , filing briefs under the emoluments clause of the Constitution , stalling appointments , relying on deep-state insurrectionary bureaucrats , cherry-picking liberal judges for obstructive passes , and going from one conspiracy theory to the next as collusion begat obstruction that begat witness tampering . More outsider advice is for Democrats to focus instead on their agenda .\nBut nothing could be more paradoxical . Or rather , what agenda ?\nOf the Democratic policies once envisioned under Bill Clinton ( opposing illegal immigration , dreams of abortions as rare , balanced budgets , workfare , being tough on crime ) , few are left . In other words , progressives logically obsess about Trump , because otherwise they would have to defend agendas that most Americans simply do not support .\nDo voters really wish to hear that illegal immigration is healthy and that the greater problem lies with us ( the paranoid host ) rather than the millions who knowingly cross the border illegally ?\nWould Americans wish to be lectured about transgendered restrooms by those who as late as 2011 opposed gay marriage ?\nDo voters think that progressive administrators , whiny indebted students , and the end of campus free speech and free assembly are models for higher education and arguments for federal bailouts ?\nDo voters really wish to hear that illegal immigration is healthy and that the greater problem lies with us ( the paranoid host ) rather than the millions who knowingly cross the border illegally ?
