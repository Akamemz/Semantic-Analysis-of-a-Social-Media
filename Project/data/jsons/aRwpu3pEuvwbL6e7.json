    "content": "Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is under fire for reportedly retaining shares in a construction materials company following a Tuesday story in The Wall Street Journal based on federal disclosure forms .\nA January 2017 ethics agreement prior to Chao \u2019 s confirmation said she would take a \u201c cash payout \u201d in April 2018 for her shares in Vulcan Materials Co. Chao was paid in shares now worth roughly $ 400,000 as deferred compensation for serving on Vulcan \u2019 s board prior to her confirmation , reported WSJ . The DOT \u2019 s head ethics official said her ownership of the shares is not a conflict of interest , a DOT spokesman said .\nAlthough WSJ claimed she had \u201c pledged to divest , \u201d Chao \u2019 s 2017 ethics agreement did not explicitly dictate that she divest from Vulcan .
