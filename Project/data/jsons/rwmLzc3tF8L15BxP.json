    "content": "Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush have long been cordial toward each other , even if they aren \u2019 t exactly besties . Both are former governors , aligned with the business-friendly establishment side of the Republican Party .\nNow , with Romney \u2019 s announcement this week that he is exploring a third run for the White House , the two men are on a potential collision course . It \u2019 s a fight neither may be eager to have , but which some donors are framing as a referendum on the past versus the future , even if both men have been well-known political figures for years .\nRomney has told many people privately that he believes Bush , as the brother of an unpopular former president , will have trouble winning the presidency . Bush , who announced last month that he was considering a presidential run , has made it clear publicly that he believes Romney ran a poor campaign when he was the GOP \u2019 s nominee in 2012 .\nAs they each look toward 2016 , and if both do end up running , they will find themselves competing for pledges from the same donors , not to mention the same pool of aides and operatives , and the same types of voters in the Republican primary .\nAlthough the emerging GOP 2016 field appears to be large and unwieldy , the establishment lane would shift dramatically if both Bush and Romney were standing in it . Many Republican insiders predict potential candidates such as New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Ohio Gov . John Kasich would find themselves struggling .\n\u201c There are enough senior bundlers capable of putting together in the millions for both Bush and Romney but not for anyone else in the establishment group , \u201d one bundler told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Romney has plenty in his network who will sign on again . Bush is putting the whole family network back together along with new people . They will compete for some big names but there will be plenty loyal to each . \u201d\nRomney , for all his flaws and his track record in the last election , has held onto some support . Bush sped up his time frame for 2016 last month by announcing his intentions on Facebook and resigning from various corporate boards , sending a clear message to donors that he was serious about a campaign just as a number of them pined openly for Romney to run again \u2014 and as Romney left them thinking he was interested .\nIn what struck many Republicans as a clear reaction to Bush , Romney laid down his own marker Friday during a meeting in New York with about 30 of his past supporters . As his longtime finance director Spencer Zwick stood by , the former Massachusetts governor surprised many of those gathered \u2014 some of whom have already said they are backing Bush \u2014 by saying he was considering a run and urging them to \u201c go tell your friends . \u201d\nRomney \u2019 s remarks Friday put in neon lights what he \u2019 d more quietly told New York financiers in December : He would not defer to Bush and did not view the former Florida governor as the de facto leader of the establishment wing of the GOP . And he followed them up on Saturday by working the phones aggressively to party strategists and others , as CNN \u2019 s David Chalian first reported .\nRomney has long dreamed of the White House , and he \u2019 s been tormented by his loss to Obama in 2012 . He said his decision wouldn \u2019 t be based on what anyone else did , and he insisted he has a broad vision for the country , according to attendees of Friday \u2019 s meeting . And yet his move struck a number of his own past supporters as a last gasp as the 2016 train appeared to be moving on without him .\nOne Republican donor said Romney \u2019 s actions could even benefit Bush by making the former Florida governor , who has been around electoral politics for three decades , look \u201c large , fresh , new . \u201d\n\u201c If donors are wistful about the past they can wait for Mitt , \u201d said the donor , who is close to Bush . \u201c If they \u2019 re focused on the future , [ the ] Right To Rise is accepting checks , cash and credit cards . \u201d\nEven Republicans who admire Romney believe he is giving off the whiff of concern \u2014 that it appears he \u2019 s realized the Draft Mitt movement was moving either too slowly or too quietly to leave an opening for him .\n\u201c He \u2019 s trying too hard , \u201d said one Republican strategist who has worked with Romney . \u201c He needed to let Jeb sink or swim . Then there would have been an opening , or not . \u201d\nRomney allies say he \u2019 ll likely take the next two months or so to decide what to do \u2014 much faster than the mid-2015 time-frame many Republicans familiar with his thinking had anticipated . Unlike most other potential candidates , Romney , having already sought the presidency twice , has the ability to to hang back and wait to see how the field shakes out .\nOne Republican was brutal in assessing things : \u201c This is Mitt \u2019 s version of scrambling \u2026 I think Mitt \u2019 s just keeping his options open and the next 90 days will tell just how many of those options actually exist . \u201d\nBut Romney \u2019 s maneuver has also made it clear that Jeb Bush is not Hillary Clinton , the Democrat who has essentially cleared her side of the field so far of any major challengers without even declaring she \u2019 s running . And some of Romney \u2019 s most influential admirers don \u2019 t believe it \u2019 s strictly vanity that \u2019 s driving him .\n\u201c I believe that the international situation is deteriorating ? so rapidly that due to his genuine patriotism , if he thinks he can beat Hillary , he will run , \u201d said the center-right radio host Hugh Hewitt , who argued in a widely read \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine essay in September that Romney could easily make a third attempt at a campaign .\nRomney will have an advantage over other Republican contenders by not needing to participate in several primary debates because voters already know him , Hewitt said in an interview Friday night .
