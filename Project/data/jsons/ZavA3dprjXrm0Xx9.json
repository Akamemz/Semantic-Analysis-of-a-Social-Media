''\n`` Today , after 10 years of investments in training and equipment and improved information sharing our cities and communities and our nation are stronger , more prepared and engaged and better equipped to address a range if threats , '' Napolitano said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on immigration reform . `` This legislation will build on these gains , strengthening both our overall national security posture and our border security .

The calls threaten to derail delicate and longstanding bipartisan negotiations for a bill to overhaul the nation 's immigration system , and Democrats have been swift to decry GOP efforts to link the two issues .\n`` Last week opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon , '' Sen.
