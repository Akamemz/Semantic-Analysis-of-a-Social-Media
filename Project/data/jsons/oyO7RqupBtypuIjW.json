Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is now seeking to delay implementation of the individual mandate for at least six months.The thinking apparently is that once Obamacare is fully in force , it will be with us forever .

Delaying Obamacare only helps the Democrats who support this boondoggle.Just look at the poll numbers showing widespread opposition to Obamacare .

An earlier survey by a Heritage Foundation affiliate found that 77 percent of respondents opposed Obamacare.Even the labor unions that backed Obama and had supported his healthcare reform bill have now turned against it over concerns that members could lose their current healthcare coverage , and the powerful AFL-CIO is calling for significant changes in the law.To top it off , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , the Montana Democrat who helped write the Affordable Care Act , has admitted that the law has become a `` huge train wreck . `` President Obama maintains that his election and re-election demonstrated support for the bill.The truth is that neither election was a referendum on Obamacare .

But on Oct. 1 , the day when the Affordable Care Act was supposed to allow access to the new healthcare exchanges , Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the administration 's decision to delay the employer mandate for a year.The suit was filed on behalf of Florida dentist Dr. Larry Kawa , who declared : `` The president has no more power than you or I do to change the law . `` Obama is afraid that if the law is fully implemented , there will be a massive blowback against the Democrats who support it going into the critical 2014 elections.The blowback is becoming evident as Americans see firsthand the unfolding disaster of the $ 300 million healthcare website that does n't work.So , let 's not play Obama 's delay game . Let the law go into effect as required and let the voters decide next November about its future .",
