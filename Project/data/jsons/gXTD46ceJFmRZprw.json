    "content": "Cheney : ' I 'd do it again in a minute ' He says the CIA \u2019 s actions did not amount to torture .\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney unapologetically pressed his defense of the CIA \u2019 s use of harsh interrogation techniques Sunday , insisting that waterboarding and other such tactics did not amount to torture and that the spy agency \u2019 s actions paled in comparison to those of terrorists targeting Americans .\n\u201c Torture , to me \u2026 is an American citizen on his cellphone making a last call to his four young daughters shortly before he burns to death in the upper levels of the Trade Center in New York on 9/11 , \u201d Cheney said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c There \u2019 s this notion that there \u2019 s moral equivalence between what the terrorists did and what we do , and that \u2019 s absolutely not true . We were very careful to stop short of torture . \u201d\nCheney also disputed the notion that any American taken prisoner overseas by terrorists was now at greater risk of being subjected to techniques like those used by the CIA .\n\u201c He \u2019 s not likely to be waterboarded . He \u2019 s likely to have his head cut off , \u201d the former vice president said of a potential American taken hostage by a group like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant . \u201c I haven \u2019 t seen them waterboard anybody . \u201d\nWhile a Senate Intelligence Committee report on the interrogation program shocked many with its vivid descriptions of one unresponsive prisoner frothing at the mouth after waterboarding and others shackled from bars in stress positions for prolonged periods , Cheney was unrepentant .\nHe repeatedly dismissed the Senate inquiry as \u201c partisan \u201d but seemed entirely comfortable with a public discussion of the once-secret techniques .\nIndeed , Cheney seemed proud of his role in creating the interrogation program .\nAsked if the report created \u201c any seed of doubt \u201d for him about the wisdom of the CIA effort , Cheney replied : \u201c No \u2026 absolutely not . \u201d\nDespite being pressed by host Chuck Todd to offer a definition of torture , Cheney did not go beyond saying the Justice Department provided legal approvals for the program , which was blasted last week in a long-awaited report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee . The panel \u2019 s study found that the interrogation effort was badly mismanaged , abandoned or never used safeguards it was supposed to follow and failed to produce the kind of critical intelligence that CIA and Bush White House officials said justified the program .\nAt one point during the NBC interview , the former vice president appeared to suggest that anything the CIA or its personnel did could not have amounted to torture , regardless of the brutality of the conduct .\nAsked about revelations in the newly released report about \u201c rectal rehydration \u201d and \u201c rectal feeding \u201d as part of the agency \u2019 s \u201c enhanced interrogation \u201d program , Cheney said he believes those procedures were undertaken for \u201c medical reasons , \u201d even though many medical experts said they are not .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t torture in terms of it wasn \u2019 t part of the program , \u201d the former vice president said .\nAs the interview aired in Washington , Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein streamed messages out on Twitter countering Cheney .\n\u201c Torture didn \u2019 t work , \u201d Feinstein wrote . \u201c CIA personnel \u2018 disturbed \u2019 by use of torture , \u2018 some to the point of tears and choking up . \u2019 \u201d\nCheney expressed no regrets as he discussed the torture controversy Sunday , even regarding the detention and aggressive interrogation of prisoners who turned out to have no known connection to terrorism .\nTodd pointed in particular to the case of Gul Rahman , who was taken prisoner in Afghanistan and chained to the floor of a CIA \u201c black site \u201d known as the Salt Pit , where he died from exposure to cold temperatures . CIA records quoted in the Senate report say Gul \u2019 s detention was a case of mistaken identity .\n\u201c Where are you going to draw the line , Chuck ? \u201d Cheney said . \u201c I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective . \u201d\nCheney insisted that the program did produce intelligence that saved lives .\nThe former vice president cited as one of the program \u2019 s successes the example of an alleged plot to fly airliners into tall buildings on the U.S. West Coast . However , the Senate report says the key information about such a plot actually came from a person not in U.S. custody .\nCheney also criticized the Senate investigation for not interviewing either CIA personnel or detainees .\n\u201c The report is seriously flawed , \u201d he said . \u201c They didn \u2019 t talk to anybody who knew anything about the program . They didn \u2019 t talk to anyone who was in the program . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s a small report , \u201d the vice president said of the review , whose full report runs to more than 6,000 pages . \u201c It didn \u2019 t begin to approach what \u2019 s required by way of responsible oversight . \u201d\nAppearing on NBC just after Cheney , Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) said the lack of interviews was due to the fact that a Justice Department criminal investigation was underway during much of the time the Senate probe took place , making it difficult to question CIA personnel involved .\nWyden also disputed Cheney \u2019 s claim that the report , which was undertaken by Democratic staffers after the GOP withdrew early on , was a \u201c partisan \u201d document .\n\u201c Facts aren \u2019 t partisan , \u201d Wyden said . \u201c We reviewed 6 million pages of documents . \u2026 There are a mountain of contradictions . \u201d\nWyden said he was troubled by aspects of a news conference held last week by CIA Director John Brennan .\n\u201c John Brennan on Thursday really opened the door to the possibility of torture being used again , \u201d the senator said , referring to the director \u2019 s comment that he would \u201c defer to the policymakers in future times when there is going to be the need to be able to ensure that this country stays safe if we face a similar type of crisis . \u201d\nBrennan did say at the news conference that he has ruled out using such techniques , which have been banned by President Barack Obama .\n\u201c If , in the future , there is some type of challenge that we face here , the Army Field Manual is the established basis to use for interrogations , \u201d Brennan said . \u201c We , CIA , are not in the detention program . We are not contemplating at all getting back into the detention program using any of those EITs . \u201d\nA U.S. intelligence official said the Senate panel increased the chances of the harsh techniques being used in the future by not looking at the role officials beyond the CIA played in creating and supervising the program .\n\u201c Sen . Wyden puts his finger on something important , \u201d said the official , who asked not to be named . \u201c CIA said it is not getting back in the detention business . But by producing such a flawed study and failing to look at how the whole of government made the decisions to implement the program , they have left the door open to bringing the techniques back under another administration . [ The committee ] has failed to provide one recommendation for how to prevent this from happening . \u201d\nHere are some of Cheney \u2019 s central claims and the underlying facts :\n\u2014 The Justice Department \u201c specifically authorized and OK \u2019 d , for example , exactly what we did , \u201d Cheney said .\nLegal opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel did authorize the use of the techniques in the \u201c enhanced interrogation \u201d program , but the Senate report says the CIA often ignored restrictions in those memos by applying techniques for lengths of times or in combinations that were never approved .\nIn addition , some detainees were subjected to tactics never legally approved , such as being threatened with a power drill , a gun or the killing of prisoners \u2019 families .\nBrennan said Thursday that some CIA officers used unauthorized techniques that \u201c were abhorrent and rightly should be repudiated by all . And we fell short when it came to holding some officers accountable for their mistakes . \u201d\n\u2014 Japanese soldiers were prosecuted \u201c for a lot of stuff . Not for waterboarding , \u201d Cheney said . \u201c To draw some kind of moral equivalent between waterboarding judged by our Justice Department not to be torture and what the Japanese did with the Bataan Death March and the slaughter of thousands of Americans , with the rape of Nanking and all of the other crimes they committed , that \u2019 s an outrage . It \u2019 s a really cheap shot . \u201d\nIn fact , at an international tribunal convened in 1946 , Japanese soldiers were put on trial for water-torture techniques including waterboarding , with some defendants sentenced to hanging and others to long prison terms .\nWhether the CIA \u2019 s use of the tactic either as directed by the White House or as carried out in practice was precisely the same as the Japanese is difficult to say , but there \u2019 s no doubt such techniques were considered war crimes by the U.S. at one time .\n\u2014 \u201c [ ISIS leader Abu Bakr al- ] Baghdadi was in the custody of the U.S. military in Iraq in Camp Bucca . He was let go , and now he \u2019 s out leading the terror attack against the United States , \u201d Cheney said .\nThe U.S. did release al-Baghdadi from a U.S.- run facility in Iraq , known as Camp Bucca , in 2009 .\nThe shutdown of the prison was part of a broader U.S. withdrawal from Iraq that then-President George W. Bush set in motion in 2008 . It \u2019 s possible detainees from Iraq could have been brought to the U.S. for prosecution or detention , but that was considered only rarely by the Obama administration and ultimately not done in Iraq .\n\u2014 \u201c This man [ Bush ] knew what we were doing , \u201d Cheney said . \u201c He authorized it ; he approved it . \u201d\nDetails of what Bush knew when remain disputed . He says in his memoir he was well aware of the program and approved using the aggressive techniques . However , former CIA directors Porter Goss and George Tenet have said they never gave Bush a briefing on the program .\nThe Senate report says that when Bush had a detailed briefing on the program in 2006 , a CIA email recounting the briefing reported he was uncomfortable with the \u201c image of a detainee , chained to the ceiling , clothed in a diaper , and forced to go to the bathroom on himself . \u201d\n\u2014 \u201c They [ Senate investigators ] didn \u2019 t talk to anybody who knew anything about the program . They didn \u2019 t talk to anybody within the program , \u201d Cheney said .\nWhile the Senate Intelligence Committee did not conduct its own interviews , it did review interviews that the CIA \u2019 s Office of Inspector General and the CIA historian did with participants in the program .\nSenate Democrats say their ability to do interviews was limited because prosecutors in an ongoing Justice Department criminal probe declined to coordinate with the panel . Backers of the report say the contemporaneous accounts of CIA personnel are the best evidence of what occurred , but some participants say they would have talked with Senate investigators if asked .\n\u2014 \u201c The Senate Committee [ was a ] partisan operation , no Republicans involved , \u201d Cheney said . \u201c It \u2019 s a cheap shot piece of political business that was not bipartisan . \u201d\nThe ultimate Intelligence Committee report was produced solely by Democratic staffers , and by the time the executive summary emerged publicly last week it had no Republican support on the panel . However , Republicans were involved in the early steps toward the investigation , and one Republican senator \u2014 Olympia Snowe of Maine \u2014 voted to approve the report last year before she retired from the Senate .\n\u201c Study is not only Democrats , \u201d Senate Intelligence Committee member Martin Heinrich ( D-N.M. ) wrote on Twitter on Sunday . \u201c 14-1 vote in 09 to begin ; 9-6 in 12 to approve ( w/ GOP Senator Snowe ) ; 11-3 in 2014 to release . \u201d",
