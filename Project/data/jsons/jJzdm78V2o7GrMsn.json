ET today , Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr announced at a joint news conference this afternoon with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .\nEgypt had been trying to broker a truce to end the exchange of rockets and air strikes between Israel and militants in Gaza .\nWe 'll post more on the agreement , which was announced at 12:35 p.m . ET. , as the story develops .\nThe cease-fire is holding . But ABC News spoke to a senior White House official who said this is a fragile deal .\n`` The way we view this is that it 's an important step , but our concerns are Egypt ca n't control all of Hamas and Hamas does n't control every extremist with a rocket in Gaza , '' the official told ABC . `` So there is a tenuous nature to this . ''\nWhile rockets and missiles do n't seem to be flying , there has been quite a bit of celebratory gunfire in Gaza City , according to correspondents there . The BBC 's Paul Danahar has posted audio of it .\nNews outlets and the many folks who have been tweeting from Gaza and Israel are not posting reports about rockets being fired at Israel or missiles hitting Gaza City .\nUpdate at 2 p.m . ET . Netanyahu Says Military Action Was Necessary :\n`` That is what a responsible government does , '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just said , referring to the military action aimed at Hamas .\n`` I know there are those who expected a more intense military response , '' he added , as The Guardian writes , `` and that may be needed , but at this time the best thing for Israel '' a cease-fire .\nUpdate at 1:55 p.m . ET . Hamas Official Says It Can Control Factions And Stop Rocket Fire :\nIn Cairo moments ago , senior Hamas official Moussa Abou Marzouq said that he is sure Hamas can control all Palestinian factions within the Gaza Strip and stop the firing of rockets into Israel , NPR 's Leila Fadel tells us .\nHe also argued that Hamas has gotten much of what it wanted : `` providing Palestinian citizens with freedom at border crossings , opening border crossings , ending the targeting of Palestinians and ending military operations . ''\nWhether those crossings will indeed be opened , though , remains to be seen .\nAgence France Presse has posted what it says is the text of the agreement .\nIt begins with : `` Israel shall stop all hostilities in the Gaza Strip land sea and air , including incursions and targeting of individuals . All Palestinian factions shall stop all hostilities from the Gaza Strip against Israel , including rocket attacks and all attacks along the border . ''\nAs for opening border crossings , that issue `` shall be dealt with after 24 hours from the start of the ceasefire . ''\nUpdate at 1:15 p.m . ET . If Hostilities Cease , Israel Wo n't Need To Act , Israeli Spokesman Says :\nOn CNN moments ago , Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said that `` if there 's no hostility from Gaza there 's no reason for Israel to act . '' In other words , there 's no reason for Israel to take aim at Hamas leaders . The truce agreement , Regev said , calls for `` a total and complete cessation of all hostile activity '' from Gaza .\n`` The details of the deal are not yet clear , says the BBC 's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen . Israel 's demands included an end to hostile fire of any kind from Gaza and international efforts to prevent Hamas from re-arming . For its part , Hamas wanted an end to the blockade on Gaza and targeted killings by Israel . ''\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to make a statement at 1:30 p.m . ET . Meanwhile , the White House says President Obama today thanked Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi `` for his efforts to achieve a sustainable ceasefire and for his personal leadership in negotiating a ceasefire proposal . President Morsi expressed appreciation for President Obama 's efforts in this regard . '' Earlier , as we reported , the president spoke with Netanyahu .\nCNN 's Ben Wedeman just tweeted that `` several rocket [ s ] just now fired out of # Gaza . ''\nUpdate at 12:45 p.m . ET . Obama Said U.S. Would Use Cease-fire Period To Help Israel `` Address Its Security Needs '' :\nDuring a telephone conversation earlier today with Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu , President Obama `` said that the United States would use the opportunity offered by a cease-fire to intensify efforts to help Israel address its security needs , especially the issue of the smuggling of weapons and explosives into Gaza , '' the White House says in a statement just emailed to reporters .\nUpdate at 12:40 p.m . ET . Clinton Cites Need For `` Just And Lasting Peace '' :\nIn her comments , the secretary of state said `` there is no substitute for a just and lasting peace . ... Now that there is a cease-fire , I am looking forward to working with the foreign minister and others to move this process . ''\nOur original post and earlier updates . `` Bomb Rips Through Bus In Tel Aviv ; Israel Continues Strikes On Gaza '' :\nWe 're posting on the latest news from Israel and the Gaza Strip , and about efforts to bring about a cease-fire or truce . There 's been an explosion on a bus today in Tel Aviv and Israel continues to hit targets in and around Gaza City . Meanwhile , efforts to broker a truce or cease-fire continue :\nUpdate at 12:10 p.m . ET . Renewed Talk Of A Truce :\nReuters reports that `` Israel and the Islamist militant group Hamas agreed on Wednesday to a Gaza cease-fire deal , said a Palestinian official with knowledge of Egyptian mediation between the two sides . ''\nCorrespondent Barack Ravid from the Israeli newspaper Haaretz tweets that `` Israel official : SecState Clinton will announce 20:00 in Cairo on cease fire in Gaza . '' That would be 1 p.m . ET . Al-Jazeera says the announcement will come from Egyptian officials .\nAs we wrote earlier , `` it 's important to bear in mind that each day we seem to get reports of truce or cease-fire deals being discussed , only to be followed by reports of rockets being fired from Gaza and Israeli air strikes in response . ''\nUpdate at noon ET . Israeli Official Says Most Of Those Killed In Gaza `` Deserved It '' :\nOn WNYC 's The Takeaway today , Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that `` if you compare the situation in Gaza , let 's say , to the situation in Syria today , where the Assad regime just mercilessly butchers people and children , there is a big difference . I would say that most of the people that were hit in Gaza deserved it , as they were just armed terrorists . ''\nUpdate at 11 a.m . ET . U.N. Secretary-General Says `` Many Details '' Need To Be Worked Out Before Any Cease-fire .\n`` U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday there were 'many details to work out ' before a cease-fire could be reached to end the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip . ' I am particularly concerned about the spiral of violence at the time of intense efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel , ' Ban said . 'We all know there are many details to work out . But while that happens civilians continue to die .
