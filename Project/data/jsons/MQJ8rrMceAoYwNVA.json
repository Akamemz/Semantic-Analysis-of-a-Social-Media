Their comments came as the U.S. saw its first instance of infection in a person without relevant travel history or exposure to another patient known to have the virus .\nWith more than 81,300 cases worldwide and spreading rapidly beyond China to South Korea , Italy and Iran , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday the virus would spread in the United States and cause `` severe '' disruptions across the country .\nAt a news conference the same day in India , President Donald Trump tried to tamp down concerns , saying the virus was `` very well under control in our country . '' The White House requested $ 2.5 billion in emergency funding this week to combat the outbreak , but congressional Democrats slammed the request as `` woefully insufficient . ''\nCoronavirus updates every day : Get \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Daily Briefing in your inbox\nHere 's what the president said Wednesday evening , and what the facts are .\nMinutes after Trump downplayed the risk of coronavirus spreading in the United States , California confirmed a new case that might be the nation \u2019 s first example of a non travel-related case of coronavirus .\n`` There \u2019 s a chance that it could get worse , \u201d Trump said . \u201c There \u2019 s a chance that it could get fairly , substantially worse . But I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s inevitable ... there \u2019 s a chance that it won \u2019 t spread . ''\nLess than an hour later , the CDC confirmed the California case involving a person who did not travel to China and was not known to be exposed to another person there with the virus .\nThe CDC said it \u2019 s unknown how the person was exposed to COVID-19 , but the agency said it could be the first example of \u201c community spread , \u201d which means an unknown source of infection . The agency has not ruled out that the person was exposed to a traveler with the virus .\nThe first 14 cases confirmed in the United States included 12 travelers returning from China and two individuals who had close contact with those travelers . The California man is the 15th confirmed case , not counting infected passengers from Diamond Princess and others repatriated from Wuhan , China .\nOn Tuesday , the CDC warned that such community spread of the virus was inevitable and predicted \u201c severe \u201d disruptions in everyday life . The agency warned schools could be closed and mass gathering suspended .\nCoronavirus , explained : Everything to know about Covid-19 , the deadly virus alarming the world\nTrump compared the small number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. to the number of flu cases this year and said , `` The flu in our country kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year . That was shocking to me . ''\nAccording to the CDC , there have been at least 29 million flu illnesses and 16,000 deaths from flu so far this season . The season is not yet over , but the number of estimated flu deaths so far this year is below the range that Trump cited .\nThe CDC reported annual flu deaths ranged from 12,000 to 61,000 since 2010 , slightly lower than figured the president cited .\nMore : Coronavirus is scary , but the flu is deadlier , more widespread\nTrump again compared coronavirus to the flu and predicted a vaccine will soon be available . \u201c We \u2019 ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner , \u201d he said .\nAnthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , also spoke at the news conference and offered a more specific time frame for efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine .\nHe said it will take about two months to determine whether a vaccine is safe through a small study in humans . That would be followed another six to eight months to conduct a larger , comprehensive medical study to gauge whether the vaccine works .\nDuring a Feb. 17 meeting with \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s editorial board meeting , Fauci said it would take at least one year to 18 months to make a vaccine that is safe and effective and ready to distribute .\n\u201c The solution to the containment of this current outbreak will not be a vaccine , \u201d Fauci said .\nStill , Fauci said the vaccine will be important and would be useful if COVID-19 returns next year as a seasonal respiratory virus .\nSeveral drugmakers are working to develop vaccines and other treatments to combat coronavirus . Gilead Sciences , a pharmaceutical company , is testing the antiviral drug remdesivir as a potential coronavirus treatment in several countries . The experimental drug was also used on a suburban Seattle man who became the nation \u2019 s first coronavirus patient .\n\u201c Johns Hopkins ... they did a study , a comprehensive \u2013 the countries best and worst prepared for an epidemic \u2013 and the United States , we \u2019 re rated No . 1 , \u201d Trump said .\nTrump was referring to the October 2019 Global Health Security Index by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative , with research by The Economist Intelligence Unit . The report evaluated the health security capabilities of 195 countries .\nWhile the U.S. ranked No.1 overall , the report found that not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic .\nThe United States scored in the bottom tier of countries for access to health care \u201c owing to lack of governmentally guaranteed access to healthcare plus high out-of-pocket expenditures per capita , \u201d the report said .\nThe latest : First coronavirus patient with 'unknown origin ' in the US was n't tested for days\nVice President Mike Pence , tapped to oversee the Trump administration 's coronavirus response , cited his experience handling MERS in Indiana , where the first U.S. case was confirmed .\nIn May 2014 , CDC confirmed two cases of MERS , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome , in the United States \u2013 one in Indiana , the other to Florida . Both cases were health care providers who lived and worked in Saudi Arabia and traveled to the United States . Both were hospitalized in the U.S. and later discharged after fully recovering .\nMERS , which originated in Saudi Arabia , resulted in 2,499 cases and 861 deaths worldwide , a fatality rate far higher than SARS or COVID-19 .\nMore Trump , coronavirus : Vice President Pence to lead Covid-19 response\nTrump lauded Pence \u2019 s record on health care when he was governor of Indiana .\n`` Everybody who knows anything about health care , they look at Indiana , '' he said . `` They \u2019 ve established a great health care ( in Indiana ) \u2026 a lot of other states have looked to . They wanted to change their health care systems . ''\nIn 2015 , Indiana implemented sweeping changes to the state \u2019 s Medicaid insurance program , requiring low-income adults to pay monthly premiums to maintain their health insurance coverage . The reforms were spearheaded by Pence and then-health policy consultant Seema Verma , who now oversees the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .\nRepublican governors in states including Kentucky and Arizona , also sought federal approval for similar restrictions , arguing such incentives encouraged able-bodied adults to seek employment and helped curb unnecessary health spending . But critics said such restrictions were unnecessarily punitive and put vulnerable people at risk of losing their health coverage .\nIn October , facing a federal lawsuit challenging the state 's work requirement , Indiana said it would postpone eliminating Medicaid benefits for those who failed to meet the work requirement .\nAlso during Pence \u2019 s tenure , a small town in Indiana became the center of an HIV epidemic tied to people injecting drugs . In all , 235 people became infected , giving Austin , Indiana , an HIV infection rate rivaling nations in sub-Saharan Africa . The Pence administration was criticized for its slow response , and under pressure allowed a clean-needle exchange to slow new cases of HIV and hepatitis C infections , according to a study that appeared in The Lancet .\nIndiana HIV outbreak : What to know about Austin 's struggles with drugs and HIV\nTrump faced several questions from reporters about the stock market as U.S. stocks slumped for a fifth straight session on Wednesday .
