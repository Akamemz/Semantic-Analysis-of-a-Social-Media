In ten different case studies, we illustrate the concrete impacts of decisions to roll back or weaken environmental or public health policies, impacts that uniquely affect children in both the short term and the long term.\n\nIMMEDIATE DANGER\n\nThe effects of some Trump administration decisions are already being felt by children and families.\n\nThe number of recalls of children\u2019s products dropped by 60 percent between 2016 and 2017 and, rather than address the problem, the agency eliminated a team tasked with finding defective children\u2019s products in 2018. Today, recalls of children\u2019s products are at their lowest level in a decade and number of fines levied for corporate misconduct has dropped by half.\n\nWeaker air-pollution rules could expose children to higher levels of contaminants like fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone, resulting in hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks, respiratory illness and missed school days that could have been prevented. Inhumane policies at the U.S.-Mexico border have meant the separation of children from their loved ones, which threatens the immediate and long-term physical and mental health of children and family members who have already been through unimaginably difficult circumstances.\n\nLONG-TERM HEALTH RISKS\n\nThe administration is endangering children\u2019s development and long-term health when it abandons science-based rules. Protections have been rolled back that should prevent exposure to toxic substances like lead, asbestos, chlorpyrifos and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The administration has also issued several rules restricting access to food assistance programs that keep millions out of poverty.\n\nEnvironmental pollutants are particularly harmful to babies and children from before birth to age eight because their bodily systems are still developing. They are not just little adults; they eat, drink and breathe more relative to their body size, making their exposure to toxic substances more pronounced. Early life exposure can affect a child\u2019s development, both physical and mental, throughout their life span.\n\nLead is a potent neurotoxin and there is no safe level of lead in children\u2019s blood. Despite this, the Trump administration\u2019s update to the lead and copper rule has actually decreased efforts to reduce childhood exposure, including cutting in half the number of lead water service systems that must be replaced. The EPA has also failed to tighten the standard for lead-based paint, and its inspector general criticized the agency\u2019s enforcement of the lead-based paint renovation, repair and painting rule.

A 2019 Lancet study, co-authored by 70 researchers, found that the global rise in temperature will be most dramatically felt by children in the form of undernutrition, dengue fever and other diarrheal diseases, electrolyte imbalance, fever, asthma and kidney disease.

Children of color and low-income children will bear the brunt of these impacts, as many policies could cut the programs like SNAP that were put in place to lift children and families out of poverty. The policies of separating immigrant children from their parents and detaining children in harsh conditions pose long-term risks to these children\u2019s mental and physical well-being.\n\nThese policy changes fly in the face of all the scientific evidence, and if they continue, they\u2019ll make it harder for future generations of children to lead happy, healthy lives.\n\nParents want to keep their kids safe and healthy, but they need help. Our elected leaders must put the well-being of children first and use the best available science to protect their health.",
