Last Tuesday , the president sat in the White House , flanked by members of both parties . In a 45-minute negotiating session , televised for full effect , Trump ignited fury among his hardcore supporters by signaling he was open to protection for Dreamers in exchange for modest border security measures .\nQuick guide What is Daca and who are the Dreamers ? Show Hide Who are the Dreamers ? Dreamers are young immigrants who would qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival ( Daca ) program , enacted under Barack Obama in 2012 . Most people in the program entered the US as children and have lived in the US for years \u201c undocumented \u201d . Daca gave them temporary protection from deportation and work permits . Daca was only available to people younger than 31 on 15 June 2012 , who arrived in the US before turning 16 and lived there continuously since June 2007 . Most Dreamers are from Mexico , El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , and the largest numbers live in California , Texas , Florida and New York . Donald Trump cancelled the program in September but has also said he wants Congress to develop a program to \u201c help \u201d the population . What will happen to the Dreamers ? Under the Trump administration , new applications under Daca will no longer be accepted . For those currently in the program , their legal status and other Daca-related permits ( such as to work and attend college ) will begin expiring in March 2018 \u2013 unless Congress passes legislation allowing a new channel for temporary or permanent legal immigration status \u2013 and Dreamers will all lose their status by March 2020 .\nTechnically , as their statuses lapse they could be deported and sent back to countries many have no familiarity with . It is still unclear whether this would happen . Fear had been rising in the run-up to last week \u2019 s announcement . Those with work permits expiring between 5 September 2017 and 5 March 2018 will be allowed to apply for renewal by 5 October . What does the recent ruling by Judge William Alsup mean ? In his ruling , Alsup ordered the Trump administration to restart the program , allowing Daca recipients who already qualify for the program to submit applications for renewal . However , he said the federal government did not have to process new applications from people who had not previously received protection under the program . When the Trump administration ended the Daca program , it allowed Daca recipients whose legal status expired on or before 5 March to renew their legal status . Roughly 22,000 recipients failed to successfully renew their legal status for various reasons . Legal experts and immigration advocates are advising Daca recipients not to file for renewal until the administration provides more information about how it intends to comply with the ruling . \u201c These next days and weeks are going to create a lot of confusion on the legal front , \u201d said Marielena Hincapie , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center , which has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration \u2019 s termination of Daca .

They would not be able to sponsor their parents for citizenship \u2013 an effort to appease Trump \u2019 s stance against so-called \u201c chain migration \u201d \u2013 but parents would be able to obtain a form of renewable legal status .\nThere would be other concessions to earn Trump \u2019 s signature , such as $ 2bn for border security including physical barriers , if not by definition a wall .\nThe compromise would also do away with the diversity visa lottery and reallocate those visas to migrants from underrepresented countries and those who stand to lose Temporary Protected Status . That would help those affected by the Trump administration \u2019 s recent decision to terminate such status for some nationals of El Salvador , effectively forcing nearly 200,000 out of the country .\nThe bill would be far less comprehensive than the one put forward in 2013 , when a bipartisan group of senators known as the \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d proposed a bill that would have given nearly 11 million undocumented migrants a path to citizenship .\nThe bill passed the Senate with rare bipartisan support .
