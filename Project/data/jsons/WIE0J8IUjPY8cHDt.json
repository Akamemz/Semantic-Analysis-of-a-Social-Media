    "content": "President Donald Trump largely stuck to the script he was given at the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum , in Jackson , Mississippi , on Saturday . Even so , his past actions and statements on race shifted the focus away from the heroes the museum was meant to honor .\nTrump \u2019 s attendance , which came at the invitation of Mississippi Gov . Phil Bryant , a Republican , sparked backlash among civil rights groups , activists , and politicians \u2014 many of whom called on him to cancel his appearance altogether , citing his record on civil rights and race and his policies that are often harmful to minorities . Black lawmakers and leaders , including civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis ( D-GA ) and Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D-MS ) skipped the opening as a protest . The NAACP held a separate press conference to honor civil rights icons in Jackson .\nThe White House has expressed regret at the backlash against Trump \u2019 s attendance without acknowledging the very real reasons people have be upset . White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement said it was \u201c unfortunate \u201d Lewis and Thompson wouldn \u2019 t attend the museum opening alongside Trump . Another White House spokesperson , Raj Shah , lamented that the event couldn \u2019 t be used for \u201c unification and bringing people together , \u201d overlooking that the president is perhaps the most divisive political figure in America today .\nTrump himself has largely ignored the controversy publicly , but his administration \u2019 s attempts to cast him as some sort of victim misunderstands and warps he history the Mississippi museum is meant to honor .\nTrump , obviously aware of the backlash , delivered a careful speech . He mentioned the \u201c God-given dignity written into every human soul \u201d and the African-American fight to end slavery , break down Jim Crow laws , end segregation , and gain the right to vote . The president also highlighted the contributions of slain Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers , whose wife , Myrlie Evers , was slated to speak at the opening and whose brother , Charles Evers , was in attendance .\nMedgar Evers was gunned down in his driveway on June 12 , 1963 , by a white supremacist . His killer remained free for more than three decades after two all-white juries deadlocked on his guilt . He was sentenced to life in prison in 1994 and died in 2002 at the age of 80 .\nDespite the planning , Trump still took the time to marvel at the quality of his own prose in the middle of his speech : \u201c That \u2019 s big stuff , those are very big phrases , very big words , \u201d he said . He also managed to talk about how much electoral success he had in Mississippi , a state that is 37 percent black and 59 percent white .\nTrump \u2019 s words rang hollow , largely because of his abysmal civil rights and race record . Trump in 1989 called for five black and Latino teenagers to be given the death penalty for committing a rape of which they were later exonerated on DNA evidence and has refused to acknowledge their innocence . As president , Trump offered an equivocal response to racist violence from white supremacists in Charlottesville , Virginia , and has frequently targeted black athletes on Twitter .
