The bill might also end the US' current policy toward Cuban immigration, which allows for essentially unlimited migration to the US.\n\nWhat would the bill actually do?\n\nThe bill the House just passed would ban the Department of Homeland Security from giving relief from deportation, or work permits, to any \"category\" of immigrants who are here unlawfully, or who come unlawfully. The government could still issue protections from deportation \u2014 but they would have to be on a case-by-case basis.\n\naccording to the administration, the bill wouldn't ban anything the president is actually doing\n\nRepublicans believe that this would prevent President Obama from implementing the executive actions he announced last month, which would allow about three and a half million unauthorized immigrants to apply for protection from deportation and work permits. But here's the problem for Republicans: the Obama administration maintains that its new program is \"case-by-case,\" not categorical. So according to the administration, even if the bill somehow passed into law \u2014 which it's extremely unlikely to do \u2014 it wouldn't actually ban anything the president is actually doing.\n\nAre Republicans trying to take away protections from unauthorized immigrants who've already gotten them?\n\nThere are over 600,000 unauthorized immigrants who've already gotten temporary protection from deportation and work permits thanks to the Obama administration.
