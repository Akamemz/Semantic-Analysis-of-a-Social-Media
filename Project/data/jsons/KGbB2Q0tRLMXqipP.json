Most of our campuses today are festooned with an array of \u201c diversity \u201d courses ( sometimes mandatory ) , multicultural centers , chief diversity and inclusion officers , initiatives to make the faculty more diverse , and so on . But that has not kept the peace with the protesters , who can always find something more that will supposedly make the campus truly \u201c inclusive . \u201d\nOne university where this has been playing out for a long time is the University of Wisconsin \u2019 s flagship campus in Madison . In this Pope Center article , emeritus professor W. Lee Hansen writes about the most recent , unhappy developments there . He argues that , far from making UW a place of harmony where students can get on with learning , they will make the campus climate worse . It is being racially balkanized and the school \u2019 s increasing efforts at stamping out everything that might bother a student in one of the numerous \u201c marginalized groups \u201d will impede discussion of anything more controversial than sports .
