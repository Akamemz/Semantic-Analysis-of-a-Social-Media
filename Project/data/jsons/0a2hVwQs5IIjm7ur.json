But Mr. Obama , who wants to bolster his actions against legal attack , seems unlikely to include parents whose children lack citizenship or green cards .

Some immigrant advocacy groups have already denounced the plan as too cautious and too small .\nThe backlash on the right , too , is well underway , with Republican lawmakers condemning what they see as a tyrannical usurpation of congressional authority by \u201c Emperor \u201d Obama . They fail to mention , though , that new priorities will put the vast deportation machinery to better use against serious criminals , terrorists and security threats , which should be the goal of any sane law-enforcement regime . Nor did they ever complain when Mr. Obama aggressively used his executive authority to ramp up deportations to an unprecedented peak of 400,000 a year .\nIt has been the immigration system \u2019 s retreat from sanity , of course , that made Mr. Obama \u2019 s new plan necessary . Years were wasted , and countless families broken , while Mr. Obama clung to a futile strategy of luring Republicans toward a legislative deal . He has been his own worst enemy \u2014 over the years he stressed his executive impotence , telling advocates that he could not change the system on his own . This may have suited his legislative strategy , but it was not true .\nIt \u2019 s good that Mr. Obama has finally turned the page . He plans to lead a rally in Las Vegas on Friday at a high school where he outlined his immigration agenda in January 2013 . Legislative solutions are a dim hope for some future day when the Republican fever breaks . But until then , here we are .\nThis initiative can not be allowed to fail for lack of support from those who accept the need for progress on immigration , however incremental .
