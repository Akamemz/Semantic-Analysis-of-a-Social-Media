    "content": "House Speaker John Boehner likes to say he learned all the skills he needs for his current job during his childhood years in Ohio \u2013 mopping floors in his dad 's bar and growing up with 11 brothers and sisters . In a two-bedroom house . With one bathroom .\nThat \u2019 s got to teach a person patience , and the Republican speaker has an abundance of it . Some say too much , especially when it comes to the latitude he gives his rebellious right-wing faction \u2013 such as right now .\nWith just 10 days before the federal government runs out of money , GOP hardliners are threatening the second widespread government shutdown in two years , this time over federal funding for Planned Parenthood .\nThey \u2019 re also considering a rare maneuver to oust Mr. Boehner from the speaker \u2019 s chair . It \u2019 s not the first time they \u2019 ve plotted to get rid of him .\nYet Boehner \u2013 \u201c the coolest cucumber I know , \u201d as one of his colleagues puts it \u2013 has been calmly exploring the options as the GOP leadership holds more than a half dozen \u201c listening \u201d sessions with members of the divided caucus . He still hasn \u2019 t found a funding solution that will satisfy everyone . He might not be able to . But pushing and prodding in his own unperturbed way , he wo n't stop trying .\n\u201c What Boehner does is , he \u2019 s very patient . He lets things play out for a while . He doesn \u2019 t get mad\u2026 . Sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn \u2019 t , \u201d says John Feehery , former spokesman for Denny Hastert , the longest serving Republican speaker .\nIt \u2019 s the tactics \u2013 not the ideology \u2013 that separate the speaker from his right flank . In 2013 , when tea partyers forced a 16-day partial government shutdown over Obamacare , Boehner was as opposed to the Affordable Care Act as they were .\nBut he repeatedly warned against a shutdown . Failing to persuade , he eventually joined in , leading the way on several measures to delay or defund the president \u2019 s signature domestic program . On Day 16 , after having exhausted all his options , he gave up the fight \u2013 and received a standing ovation from his caucus , hardliners included , for his efforts .\nAs he explained to the former late-night television host Jay Leno last year , \u201c You learn that a leader without followers is simply a man taking a walk . \u201d\nThis time , Boehner is again in lockstep with the right flank on the substance of the issue . Videos showing officials of Planned Parenthood , a women \u2019 s health provider , discussing the sale of aborted fetus parts for scientific research are \u201c gruesome , \u201d he has said , and the federal government should stop funding the group .\nYet neither he nor Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell ( R ) of Kentucky want to shut down the government over it . Trying to defund Planned Parenthood with a Democratic president in the White House is an \u201c exercise in futility , \u201d as Senator McConnell put it .\nAt a closed-door GOP caucus meeting last week , the House leadership shared internal polling that showed that two-thirds of respondents in 18 GOP swing districts oppose shutting the government to try to stop funding Planned Parenthood , according to Politico . In 2013 , the GOP \u2019 s approval ratings plummeted in the wake of the shutdown .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean much to Rep. John Fleming ( R ) of Louisiana , who belongs to the House Freedom Caucus , a group of more than 40 hardliners formed this year to challenge the GOP leadership . Congressman Fleming says he \u2019 s one of 31 members who have pledged not to vote for legislation \u2013 be it a short-term or long-term budget \u2013 that funds Planned Parenthood . \u201c That \u2019 s my conscience vote . \u201d\nAnd so the speaker has been patiently rolling out other options \u2013 investigations of Planned Parenthood in the House , legislation to freeze funding for the organization , and an abortion-related bill . Both bills passed the GOP-controlled House on Friday , but will be blocked by Senate Democrats .\nAnd that \u2019 s where another leadership proposal comes in . In order to actually get a defunding bill to the president \u2019 s desk , they \u2019 ve proposed using a legislative process known as \u201c budget reconciliation \u201d that only needs a majority vote to pass . It would get to the president all right , but he would veto it .\nHardliners say they aren \u2019 t interested in this \u201c show vote. \u201d Instead they seem determined to press for the shutdown , and try to put the blame on the president .\nAs the speaker cycles through his options and the calendar clicks closer to a shutdown , some of his allies are getting frustrated with the repeated clashes . There was another one earlier this year over immigration and funding for the Department of Homeland Security .\nBoehner supporter Rep. Devin Nunes ( R ) of California calls the hardliners \u201c right-wing Marxists \u201d who use extreme tactics to promote themselves \u2013 and then offer no realistic , alternative plans . The speaker , he says with exasperation , \u201c let \u2019 s these guys get away with everything . \u201d\nTake the case of Rep. Mark Meadows ( R ) of North Carolina , who in July filed a rare motion to \u201c vacate the chair \u201d and call a new election for the speakership . Such a move hasn \u2019 t been tried in 105 years \u2013 and it didn \u2019 t succeed then .\nThe speaker could have killed off the Meadows resolution in the Rules Committee , which the speaker controls \u2013 but he didn \u2019 t . He could have brought it immediately to the floor for a vote he would have won , and stamped out the spark before it caught fire \u2013 as some of his allies urged . He didn \u2019 t .\n`` He chose not to press his advantage and divide his caucus , '' said Rep. Tom Cole ( R ) of Oklahoma .\nIn July , Boehner called the Meadows move \u201c no big deal , \u201d but right-wingers are talking about returning to it after the pope \u2019 s visit this week . It is unlikely to succeed but nothing is certain .\nIntraparty division is not new in Congress , says former House historian Ray Smock . He recalls the civil rights era , when both parties had deeply divided caucuses . But this is different , he says , because of the uncompromising wing of Boehner \u2019 s party .\n\u201c I think Boehner is seriously trying to run the House the way it \u2019 s supposed to be run , but this has been a losing proposition for him since the advent of the tea party , \u201d says Mr. Smock . \u201c You \u2019 ve got an awful lot of members in that caucus that don \u2019 t really care that government functions well . They \u2019 re elected as antigovernment people . \u201d\nWhich raises the question : What \u2019 s the point of patience with recalcitrants ?\nMr. Feehery says the free rein Boehner gave the tea partyers during the last shutdown could have been meant as a learning experience for them \u2013 but it simply emboldened them .
