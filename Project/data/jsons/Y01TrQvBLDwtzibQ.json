    "content": "Pope Francis held his first mass as leader of the Catholic Church Thursday , urging cardinals that the church should stick to its roots and avoid modern temptations .\nIn his first homily at the Sistine Chapel , Jorge Mario Bergoglio , the 76-year-old Argentine cardinal who was elected pope by his peers on Wednesday , warned that the church risked becoming a `` pitiful '' non-governmental organization unless it goes through spiritual renewal and focuses on the message of Jesus Christ , Sky News reports .\n`` If we do not confess to Christ what would we be ? '' Francis said . `` We would end up a pitiful NGO . What would happen would be like when children make sand castles and then it all falls down . ''\nFrancis and all the cardinals in attendance wore light yellow robes over their cassocks , while the new pope spoke in Italian without notes .\nEarlier Thursday , Francis stopped by his hotel to pick up his luggage and pay the bill himself and praying at Rome 's main basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary .\nMore On This ... Pope Francis : The new leader of the Catholic Church\nHe entered the St. Mary Major basilica through a side entrance just after 8 a.m. and left about 30 minutes later .\n`` He spoke to us cordially , like a father , '' Father Ludovico Melo , a priest who prayed with Pope Francis , told Reuters . `` We were given 10 minutes ' advance notice that the pope was coming . ''\nAfter becoming the first pontiff from the Americans , Francis had told a crowd of some 100,000 people packed in rain-soaked St. Peter 's Square just after his election that he intended to pray Friday to the Madonna `` that she may watch over all of Rome . ''\nBergoglio chose the name Francis , drawing connections to the humble 13th-century saint who saw his calling as trying to rebuild the church in a time of turmoil .\nBenedict 's longtime aide , Monsignor Georg Gaenswein , accompanied Francis to the visit Thursday morning at St. Mary Major . In addition to being Benedict 's secretary , Gaenswein is also the prefect of the papal household and will be arranging the new pope 's schedule .\nLike many Latin American Catholics , Francis has a particular devotion to the Virgin Mary , and his visit to the basilica was a reflection of that . He prayed before a Byzantine icon of Mary and the infant Jesus , the Protectress of the Roman People .\n`` He had a great devotion to this icon of Mary and every time he comes from Argentina he visits this basilica , '' said one of the priests at the basilica , the Rev . Elio Montenero . `` We were surprised today because he did not announce his visit . ''\nHe then went into the main altar area of the basilica and prayed before relics of the manger in Bethlehem where Jesus is said to have been born \u2014 an important pilgrimage spot for Jesuits .\nMembers of his flock were charmed Thursday when Francis stopped by the Vatican-owned residence where he routinely stays during visits to Rome .\nThe Rev . Pawel Rytel-Andrianek , who teaches at the nearby Pontifical Holy Cross University and is staying at the residence , said he did n't just come to get his luggage , noting that anyone could have come to get his suitcases .\n`` He wanted to come here because he wanted to thank the personnel , people who work in this house , '' he said . Francis met with the staff in the dining room . `` He greeted them one by one , no rush , the whole staff , one by one , '' Rytel-Andrianek said , noting that the pope knew everyone by name .\n`` People say that he never in these 20 years asked for a ( Vatican ) car , '' he said . `` Even when he went for the conclave with a priest from his diocese , he just walked out to the main road , he picked up a taxi and went to the conclave . So very simple for a future pope . ''\nFrancis has also spoken by phone with Benedict , who became the first pope to resign in 600 years and has been living at the papal retreat in Castel Gandolfo . Francis was expected to visit him this week , but a Vatican spokesman , the Rev . Thomas Rosica , said Francis would n't make the trip to Castel Gandolfo on Thursday , and probably would n't go Friday , either .\nThe visit is significant because Benedict 's resignation has raised concerns about potential power conflicts emerging from the peculiar situation of having a reigning pope and a retired one .\nAs the long-time archbishop of Buenos Aires , Francis has spent nearly his entire career at home in Argentina , overseeing churches and shoe-leather priests . In choosing a 76-year-old pope , the cardinals clearly decided that they did n't need a vigorous , young pope who would reign for decades but rather a seasoned , popular and humble pastor who would draw followers to the faith and help rebuild a church stained by scandal .\nGroups of supporters waved Argentine flags Wednesday night in St. Peter 's Square as Francis , wearing simple white robes , made his first public appearance as pope .\nChants of `` Long live the pope ! '' arose from the throngs of faithful , many with tears in their eyes . Crowds went wild as the Vatican and Italian military bands marched through the square and up the steps of the basilica , followed by Swiss Guards in silver helmets and full regalia .\nFrancis appeared on the balcony of St. Peter 's Basilica just after a church official announced `` Habemus Papum '' -- `` We have a pope '' -- and gave Bergoglio 's name in Latin .\n`` Ladies and Gentlemen , good evening , '' he said to wild cheers before making a reference to his roots in Latin America , which accounts for about 40 percent of the world 's Roman Catholics .\nFrancis asked for prayers for himself , and for retired Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI , whose resignation paved the way for the conclave that brought the first Jesuit to the papacy .\n`` You know that the work of the conclave is to give a bishop to Rome , '' Francis said . `` It seems as if my brother cardinals went to find him from the end of the earth . Thank you for the welcome . ''\nBergoglio has shown a keen political sensibility as well as the kind of self-effacing humility that fellow cardinals value highly , according to his official biographer , Sergio Rubin . He showed that humility on Wednesday , saying that before he blessed the crowd he wanted their prayers for him and bowed his head .\n`` Good night , and have a good rest , '' he said before going back into the palace .\nIn a lifetime of teaching and leading priests in Latin America , which has the largest share of the world 's Catholics , Francis has been known for modernizing an Argentine church that had been among the most conservative in Latin America .\nLike other Jesuit intellectuals , Bergoglio has focused on social outreach .
