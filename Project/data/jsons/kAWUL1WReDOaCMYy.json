    "content": "Since Obamacare was passed in 2010 , dozens of changes have been made to the legislation by executive fiat , not through Congress . One of those changes includes the Obama administration going around Congress to issue payments from the Treasury Department directly to health insurance companies .

By implementing the delay , the administration effectively altered the law without a vote from Congress .\nIn November 2014 , the House of Representatives sued over the changes coming directly from the White House . Liberal George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley has been hired by the House to lead the lawsuit against the administration . The administration wants the lawsuit thrown out .\nYesterday the case was argued in front of U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer , who seriously questioned the administration 's actions of going around Congress to fund parts of Obamacare that the legislative body rejected .
