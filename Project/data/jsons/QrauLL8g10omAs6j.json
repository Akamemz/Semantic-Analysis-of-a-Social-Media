It's all about fundamentals: getting ready for the regular season and hopefully the playoffs.\n\nBut while the return of baseball is usually a good news story, you may not be as pleased to think that another long season of competition is also getting underway.\n\nIt has its own form of spring training in the fundamentals \u2014 and the eventual winner moves into the White House.\n\nGrapefruit, Cactus, Corn And Granite\n\nFor spring training, major league teams based in Florida play in what's called the Grapefruit League. There's also the Cactus League in Arizona.\n\nBut in politics, most of the early action is in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states on the presidential nominating calendar.\n\nYou might call it the Corn Circuit and the Granite League.\n\nFan Interaction\n\nElection Day in Iowa and New Hampshire is still some 11 months away, which means would-be candidates have a chance to spend a lot of time there to win over voters.\n\nActually, it's a requirement.\n\nIn Iowa, a presidential hopeful will boast of having visited all 99 counties, holding small meet-and-greets at coffee shops and pizza joints in every part of the state. New Hampshire is much smaller and thus easier to traverse. But the voters there like to meet every single candidate running in person multiple times before deciding who to support.\n\nIt's another way the early days of a campaign are like baseball's preseason. There's access right now in baseball \u2014 and lots of it. Autographs and encounters with players are easy to come by during this phase.\n\nSo it is with candidates. The security buffer isn't up yet, and Secret Service agents aren't keeping the crowds and the press at a distance.\n\nNow Back To The Game\n\nDuring the radio broadcast of last week's game with the Washington Nationals, Atlanta Braves announcer Ben Ingram said, \"Well, spring training is definitely an opportunity to get better, to work on what you need to work on, become better at your craft.\"\n\n\"They'll try out different types of speeches \u2014 funny speeches, serious speeches \u2014 to see how they are at delivering them, and to see what kind of reaction they can get from the crowd.\"\n\nLynn Vavreck, a professor at UCLA, describes the presidential candidates' version of the same.\n\n\"They'll go and they'll give little speeches \u2014 or sometimes big speeches \u2014 to groups. And they'll try out messages,\" she says. \"They'll try out different types of speeches \u2014 funny speeches, serious speeches \u2014 to see how they are at delivering them, and to see what kind of reaction they can get from the crowd, what kind of rapport they can build.\"\n\nBall clubs use this time of year to work on potential weaknesses. Campaigns do, too. Take Jeb Bush, who has had to answer the persistent question about being another Bush. His father was the 41st president. His brother was the 43rd. He's looking to be the 45rd.\n\nHe's asked about it just about everywhere he goes. He answer always includes some version of this: \"I love my dad. In fact, my dad is the greatest man alive. ...

But it's no guarantee. (Ask the Yankees.)\n\nIn politics, though, it's a campaign's lifeblood. Paying for TV ads is the big ticket, but there's also staff, opposition research and high-tech tools. Still ... it's no guarantee of success there, either.\n\nRookie Phenoms\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nBush is one of the seasoned veterans on the campaign trail this year. But in spring training, fans love to watch for the next new phenom to catch fire.\n\nIn the presidential race so far, that person appears to be Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.

He was asked a question about how he would handle ISIS. In his answer he cited his experience dealing with the massive union-backed protests during his first term as governor in Wisconsin. His staff had to assure reporters that he wasn't comparing union members to terrorists.\n\nThe Burden Of Being The Odds-On Favorite\n\nIf it's sometimes tricky for rookies, the highly touted favorites bear a different burden. Right now people say Hillary Clinton is a sure bet to make it to the World Series. But expectations bring scrutiny and pressure: Witness the current controversy involving her emails while she was secretary of state, and the critical reviews of the press conference she held last week in an effort to explain why she used a personal email account for government business.\n\nDefending her right to delete emails that she said were strictly personal, Clinton said, \"They were personal and private about matters that I believed were within the scope of my personal privacy and that particularly of other people.\"\n\nThe questions at the news conference were tough.

They're like the box scores on spring training baseball games: They don't always tell us much about how the season will actually go.\n\nEight years ago there was a highly touted presidential contender named Rudy Giuliani. At this same point in the 2008 presidential cycle, Giuliani was way ahead in the polls.\n\nAs it turned out, he never made it past Florida.",
