    "content": "Two Florida businessmen tied to President Donald Trump 's lawyer and the Ukraine impeachment investigation were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations .\nThe charges relate to a $ 325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump 's reelection .\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman , associates of Rudy Giuliani , were arrested Wednesday trying to board an international flight with one-way tickets at Dulles International Airport in Virginia , according to Geoffrey Berman , the U.S. attorney in Manhattan . No destination was disclosed .\nParnas and Fruman were arrested on a four-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy , making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records . The men had key roles in Giuliani 's efforts to launch a Ukrainian corruption investigation against Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter .\nThe indictments mark the first criminal charges related to the Ukraine controversy . While they do not suggest wrongdoing by the president , they raise additional questions about how those close to Trump and Giuliani sought to use their influence .\nTrump has dismissed the impeachment inquiry as baseless and politically motivated .

But wire transfer records that became public through a lawsuit show that the corporate entity reported as making the transaction was not the source of the money .\nThe big donation to the Trump-allied PAC was part of a flurry of political spending tied to Parnas and Fruman , with at least $ 478,000 in donations flowing to GOP campaigns and PACs in little more than two months .\nThe money enabled the relatively unknown entrepreneurs to quickly gain access to the highest levels of the Republican Party , including meetings with Trump at the White House and Mar-a-Lago in Florida .\nProsecutors also allege that Parnas urged a congressman to seek the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine , at the behest of Ukrainian government officials .
