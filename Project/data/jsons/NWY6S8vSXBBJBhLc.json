However , this past week , Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the war hero on social media , at a campaign-style rally and even in an Oval Office meeting with a visiting dignitary .\nIn an interview with Fox Business Network 's Maria Bartiromo , Mr. Trump defended his ongoing tirades against the dead lawmaker , appearing to blame the media for bringing it up in the first place .\n`` No , I do n't talk about it . People ask me the question , I did n't bring this up . You just brought it up , you asked the question , '' Mr. Trump said when asked why he continued to attack McCain .\nHe added , `` When they ask me the question , I answer the question .
