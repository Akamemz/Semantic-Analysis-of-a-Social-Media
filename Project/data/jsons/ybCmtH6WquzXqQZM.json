    "content": "Illegal immigration across the southwest border surged last month as President Trump \u2019 s zero-tolerance effort crumbled , and smugglers and migrant families rushed to take advantage of renewed \u201c catch-and-release \u201d loopholes .\nBorder officials acknowledged a \u201c crisis \u201d as the number of families reached record levels , topping even the worst days of the Obama administration .\nIt \u2019 s so bad that caravans of families like the one that drew headlines this spring have become commonplace . Authorities reported groups of 65 , 65 , 66 , 96 and 163 illegal immigrants caught in just the last two weeks \u2014 with children as young as four months being carried through the scorching deserts of northern Mexico and southern Arizona .\nThe caravans are a sign of how brazen migrants have become , said Kevin McAleenan , commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection . He said they know there \u2019 s little the administration can do , given court decisions hindering deportations , and lack of resources from Congress .\n\u201c These are a very direct response to the vulnerabilities in our legal framework , \u201d he said .\nHe said the numbers were \u201c expected , \u201d given the administration \u2019 s widely publicized retreat from its zero-tolerance policy at the border , which came after immigrant-rights activists and members of Congress from both parties complained . Mr. McAleenan said that fight may even have perversely encouraged more people to come , after they became aware of the \u201c loophole \u201d of more lax treatment for illegal immigrant families .\nWith a month still to go in this fiscal year the Border Patrol has already caught more than 90,000 \u201c family units \u201d of parents and children traveling together \u2014 including 12,744 in August alone . That was up 38 percent compared to July .\nAgents also nabbed another 4,396 Unaccompanied Alien Children , or children traveling without parents , which was an 11.6 percent increase . At the ports of entry , meanwhile , CBP officers encountered 9,016 unauthorized migrants , including 3,181 family units and 376 UAC .\nOfficials believe the number of people caught trying to sneak in is a rough yardstick for the overall flow , so a rise in apprehensions signals a rise in overall illegal immigration .\nWhile adults who arrive at the border without children are usually detained until they can be deported , migrants who show up with children in tow get quickly released from custody . They rarely return for their deportations , instead taking the chance to disappear into the shadows .\nMr. McAleenan said the incentives are so skewed that families and children actually want to get caught when they show up at the border .\n\u201c Now with families and kids , there are no consequences to being apprehended , \u201d he said .\nIndeed , of nearly 95,000 Central American family members nabbed by Border Patrol agents or CBP officers in 2017 , 98.6 percent of them are still in the U.S. today , the government says .\nAnd of more than 30,000 UAC nabbed , 98.2 percent were still in the U.S. as of June .\nMigrants and the smuggling cartels , which control the flow of people into the U.S. , are well aware of the disparate treatment . There \u2019 s even been a surge in illegal immigrants abducting children so they can portray themselves as families .\nAmong agents , the lax treatment of families is known as \u201c catch-and-release , \u201d and it continues to be the biggest issue fueling the illegal immigration surge , said Brandon Judd , president of the National Border Patrol Council .\nHe said the government had a window to change the trajectory last year , when Mr. Trump took office and illegal immigrants , scared of tougher enforcement , stopped coming . But they quickly realized the president \u2019 s tough talk was belied by lack of backup from Congress and the enforcement agencies , Mr. Judd said .\n\u201c Congress obviously didn \u2019 t pass laws to close loopholes and the agency failed to implement policies or operations supporting the president \u2019 s vision . Instead , the agency \u2019 s inaction made the president \u2019 s tough talk seem like nothing more than words that can be ignored , \u201d Mr. Judd said .\nThe Trump administration did try to solve the situation earlier this year with its zero-tolerance policy , which called for jailing illegal immigrant adults \u2014 even those who came with children .
