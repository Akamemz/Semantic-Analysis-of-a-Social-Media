    "content_original": "Marked by vicious insults and shouting that left CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer at times scrambling to maintain control, the final debate before Super Tuesday set a new low for a Republican Party that, counter-intuitively, desperately needed this moment to occur. For the first time in 10 debates and six months, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz finally ignored each other and turned on Donald Trump, viciously attacking his record, character, and policy platform, which Rubio memorably described as \u201cEveryone\u2019s dumb, he\u2019s going to make America great again. Win, win, win.\u201d But with nearly half of the delegates needed to win the nomination on the line, and Trump still leading in almost every state, it remains unclear whether the chaos of Thursday night will be enough to catapult either candidate into the front-runner position.\n\nOn its surface, the debate was so crazy that during one three-way exchange between Trump, Rubio, and Cruz, CNN\u2019s closed-captioning gave up and simply wrote \u201cunintelligible yelling\u201d. But behind the chaos (and Ben Carson\u2019s bizarre line about fruit salad was a new strategy to take down Trump: attack him, unrelentingly. As soon as the debate started, they both sandwiched him on immigration, with Cruz calling his plan \u201camnesty\u201d (the A-word of conservatism), and Rubio emphatically attacking Trump for illegally hiring Polish workers, paying a million-dollar fine for doing so. \u201cIf he builds the wall the way he built Trump Tower, he'll be using illegal immigrants to do it,\u201d he joked. They continued to tag-team him on several of his past scandals, such as the lawsuit he is facing over \u201cfake school\u201d Trump University (a mere civil suit, Trump retorted), the tax returns he has not released (because, Trump claimed, he is currently being audited), and what both described as his total lack of actual policy plans to deal with real problems.\n\nRubio especially had several breakout moments, armed with a series of comebacks and quick to respond to Trump\u2019s almost-clich\u00e9d insults. (At one point during a heated exchange about health care, Trump brought up Rubio\u2019s much-maligned gaffe where he repeated himself \u201cfive times\u201d during the New Hampshire debates. \u201cI just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago,\u201d Rubio responded, unable to conceal his delight at having turned the tables.) At times, it appeared that Rubio had taken several lessons from the Trump Academy of the Dramatic Arts, rolling his eyes, waving his hands about for effect, and seeming far more human than the \u201cMarco Roboto\u201d of weeks past.\n\nEven Cruz supporter Glenn Beck said that it was the Florida senator\u2019s best performance yet, giving new life to Rubio\u2019s campaign and, perhaps, reviving hopes Trump would not run away with the Republican nomination.\n\nBut despite a much more spirited performance from the two senators, Trump continued to leverage the same talking points against them, amping up the vitriol. Rubio was now a sweaty-faced \u201cchoke artist\u201d instead of just an inexperienced young man who kept \u201crepeating\u201d himself; Cruz was no longer just a \u201cliar\u201d who screwed over Carson in Iowa, but a \u201cbasket case\u201d and a \u201ccrazy zealot.\u201d (Cruz responded in turn, asking Trump to \u201cget back on [his] meds\u201d.)",
