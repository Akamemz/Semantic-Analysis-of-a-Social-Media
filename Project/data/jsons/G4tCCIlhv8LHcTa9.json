Economically distressed , packed with working-class white voters and politically volatile , these states represent Romney \u2019 s best chance for a victory in the fall .\nWhile Romney must certainly win Florida and reclaim the two southern states snatched by President Obama in 2008 , Virginia and North Carolina , Romney has the most room to grow in the Rust Belt .\nDuring his five-day swing Mr. Romney \u2019 s bus will be driving through eight states worth 105 electoral votes , all won by Obama . While Indiana is all but certain to switch back to red , and Ohio and Iowa stand out as true swing states , most of the rest promise to be tough tests for Romney , particularly Pennsylvania , Michigan and Wisconsin .\nBut there is more potential in this region for Romney than any other GOP nominee in a generation . The key to winning these states for Republicans in the modern era is to forge a coalition between moderate suburbanites and more conservative rural and small-town voters .\nWith antipathy toward Obama very strong in rural counties and Romney a candidate seemingly tailor-made for suburban voters , that coalition may be in reach for the GOP in a way not seen since the Reagan era .\nThe Rust Belt was where the Republicans got wiped out in 2006 and 2008 House elections , but also where the GOP staged its strongest comeback in 2010 .\nMore than half of the 35 seats reclaimed by Republicans in the 2010 election from Democratic victories in the previous two cycles came in the states on Romney \u2019 s circuit and 22 of the 63 overall Republican pickups nationwide came from these states along Interstate 70 and to its north .\nObama says his target region is the Mountain West , partly a function of the fact that his campaign manager hails from the region and has staked so much on holding and gaining in that part of the country . Obama \u2019 s move to grant temporary amnesty to illegal immigrants who came to America as minors is evidence of how far the president is willing to go to keep Colorado , Nevada and New Mexico in his column and try to make Republicans waste resources in Arizona .\nPresident Obama also needs to play some defense out West , too . Since Obama is almost guaranteed to give back 26 electoral votes from North Carolina and Indiana , Romney could really box in the president if he were to pluck another 15 electoral votes from Nevada and Colorado away from the blue team .\nBut there are only 20 electoral votes up for grabs in states beyond the Mississippi River Valley .\nWith Obama staggering a bit after the opening round of the general election fight , the political universe is already shrinking down to a trapezoidal swatch of the nation from Richmond , Va. to Des Moines , Iowa to Milwaukee , Wis. , to Manchester , N.H. and back to Richmond . The residents of this quadrangle will see more of the candidates ( and political ads ) than anyone else .\nFlorida , with as many electoral votes now as shrinking New York , will remain a strong temptation for Obama , but the real battleground for this election will be the same as it has been for three consecutive cycles . And at the heart of it is the Rust Belt .\nThe demographics and economic conditions of these states bode well for Romney . After 40 years of economic decline , the Panic of 2008 and resulting recession has proven particularly painful in these states . Areas with shrinking populations and low-growth economies are generally shielded from the worst of a downturn , but also often have the hardest time regaining even nominal growth .\nThere are success stories \u2013 a natural gas boom in some regions to the east and strong , stable job growth in Iowa \u2013 but the overall picture is of a region pushed to the brink by a perpetually lousy economy .\nRomney \u2019 s message is that Obama has made the recession worse and longer than necessary by adding an expensive , complex health-insurance entitlement program and new environmental and labor restrictions onto an already sagging economy .\nObama hopes that he can turn the election into a remake of Michael Moore \u2019 s \u201c Roger and Me , \u201d in which Team Obama makes Romney out to be a blood-sucking corporate raider whose policies reflect the same outlook that Democrats blame for the demise of major manufacturing in most of the region .\nRepublicans blame increasing labor costs and excessive regulations for the devastation , but Democrats have mostly won the political argument in the region with the more flattering line of reasoning that says Republicans paid off big business backers with incentives for trading expensive American payrolls for the cheap wages of the developing world .\nOutsourcing is a very dirty word in this part of the country .
