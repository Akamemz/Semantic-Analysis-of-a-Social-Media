    "content": "Gillette , the shaving company , debuted a new commercial this week that assails `` toxic masculinity '' and challenges men to behave better toward women and each other . But since modern cultural discourse involves two constantly outraged tribes careening wildly from one controversy to the next , this perfectly inoffensive message has somehow been rendered bad by team red .\n`` The Gillette commercial is the product of mainstream radicalized feminism\u2014and emblematic of Cultural Marxism , '' wrote Turning Point USA 's Candace Owen , a conservative pundit . Right-leaning author Michael Knowles accused Gillette of `` granting the premises of SJW jackals . '' And over at National Review , Ben Shapiro claimed that the company was `` kowtowing to leftist social priorities '' in order to `` inoculate [ itself ] from the woke scolds of the Left . '' ( If that was the goal , the ad will certainly fail\u2014woke scolding is a condition for which there is no reliable vaccine . )\nThese strong claims\u2014cultural Marxism ! SJW jackals ! Leftist social priorities ! \u2014should strike anyone who actually watches the ad as fairly ridiculous . Here it is :\nYes , the ad invokes `` toxic masculinity , '' an ill-defined concept sometimes deployed by the campus left in overbroad ways . But most of the ad depicts men deciding not to bully each other , harass women , or commit violence . Are these really `` leftist social priorities '' ? Do conservatives really wish to portray them as such ?\nShapiro 's catchphrase is `` facts do n't care about your feelings , '' which he deploys\u2014often correctly\u2014to chide the left for having rendered unsayable something that is true : There are generally some differences between men and women , for instance . But this seems to be a case where the right 's feelings are getting in the way of facts . Men commit a lot more violence than women , sexual harassment is undeniably a problem in many workplaces , and boys should be raised not to attack each other .\nIt 's true that not all men engage in violence , sexual harassment , and bullying\u2014and on the flip side , plenty of women are abusers . Collectivist assumptions are obnoxious\u2014and anathema to libertarian principles\u2014whether they are deployed against men , women , white people , black people , etc . Certainly , some on the left are guilty of going this route ( as are many who claim to speak for the right ) . But the ad never said that all men are bad . It never argued that masculinity is always and everywhere a dangerous ideal . It made a very modest statement\u2014treat people better\u2014in hopes of selling more razors to people who agree . Again , why is this bad ?\nTo his credit , Shapiro makes perfectly legitimate points in the rest of his column about the importance of young men having strong male role models in their lives :\nIf you want to raise a generation of men who will treat women well , act as protectors rather than victimizers , and become the bedrock for a stable society , you need more masculinity , not less .
