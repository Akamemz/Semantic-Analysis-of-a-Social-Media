    "content": "Pastor Jerry Morrell was not playing to his audience . \u201c I was asked if Donald Trump is a man of God , \u201d the evangelical preacher told the congregation of The Way of Holiness church on the outskirts of Buckhannon , West Virginia . \u201c I said : \u2018 No , I don \u2019 t see him as a man of God .

I pointed out there was another choice : Hillary Clinton . \u201c No ! That \u2019 s not my other choice . We \u2019 ve had enough of that , \u201d she said with a laugh . \u201c It was very difficult for me . Very difficult . In fact it was a toss-up between not voting at all and voting for him . I really had to pray about that . \u201d\nMorgan had lots of problems with Trump but a big one was the way he spoke about women and immigrants . \u201c I don \u2019 t think he should talk about people like that .

As a Christian , I don \u2019 t believe in treating people the way he treated some people , \u201d she said .\nMorgan \u2019 s mind was made up by the supreme court . She wants to see a court \u201c following Godly principles \u201d and she had little doubt that Clinton would have nominated the wrong kind of justices . \u201c That \u2019 s important to me . On abortion number one . Same-sex marriage . Anything to do with either one of those . And I have a feeling there may be some issues come up even later that may touch on Christian principles too . I have no clue what , but you never know when something might come up that \u2019 s against my beliefs , \u201d she said .\nIn parts of West Virginia , it is said there are two reasons to vote : God and coal . Both have been in retreat for years . In a state where families still pray at the restaurant dinner table , and mines were once the engine of prosperity , Trump won with the promise of revival .\nBut there \u2019 s a paradox . Evangelicals may doubt Trump \u2019 s commitment to God , but they calculate he will be good for their push to inject more religion into American life . On the other hand , those who voted for Trump because he promised to bring back coalmines often admire his business skills \u2013 but they do have doubts about whether he can deliver .\nSo far , conservative Christians have not had reason to be disappointed . Trump \u2019 s appointment of evangelicals to his cabinet \u2013 including an attorney general who advocates an end to the wall between church and state , and an education secretary who wants to \u201c advance God \u2019 s kingdom \u201d through public funding of religious schools \u2013 has sent the right signals . And just in case Trump veers off course , evangelicals are counting on Mike Pence , an advocate of teaching creationism alongside Darwinism , to steer the president straight .\n\u201c We are very much right-to-life people and Trump seems to be more favorable toward that point of view than former administrations , \u201d said Morrell . \u201c We love people of all beliefs and backgrounds , and yet we also want to have the liberty of believing marriage is between a man and a woman , and to hold to that conviction without being sued for discrimination . Sometimes that \u2019 s painted in such a negative way when it used to be everyone \u2019 s view . Sometimes on the right we \u2019 re painted as racists and bigots and haters . We \u2019 re not , but we want to be allowed to hold to traditional values . \u201d\nThe pastor acknowledges that Trump does not live by those same values . Of the president \u2019 s boasting about touching women \u2019 s genitals , he said that \u201c it bothered me tremendously . I \u2019 m a father of four daughters and I have a lovely wife I want to be respected . But I attribute that to being in his past , \u201d he said . \u201c I do wish he would do a better job of reaching out to his opposition and not lashing out . I do believe we need to work together as a nation regardless of our beliefs . I really am concerned about the racial strife that has gotten worse over the last eight years . \u201d\nFor that , Morrell blames Barack Obama . \u201c The former administration , in continually emphasizing our differences instead of what we have in common , created an us and them atmosphere , and it has happened not only racially but among political parties and on the lines of wealth and poor . It \u2019 s been us and them when it needs to be us as Americans , \u201d the pastor said .\nObama gets blamed for a lot more : his remarks about working-class people clinging to religion and guns during his first run for the White House festered right through his presidency . And , more than anything , he became known as the man who killed the mines .\nIt \u2019 s an article of faith in West Virginia that Obama \u2019 s \u201c war on coal \u201d put mines out of business . The industry helped push the claim by resisting Environmental Protection Agency regulations , which are widely viewed as a plot to make coalmining unviable .\nTrump , on the other hand , promised to revive the mines that once provided a good living for much of this part of Appalachia . On 28 March , he signed orders rolling back measures to combat global warming , including pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants and lifting a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands in an effort to boost the mining industry . The move came days after he told a rally in Kentucky that he was rolling back regulations : \u201c We are going to put our coalminers back to work . \u201d\nIn the southern part of the state , people are already talking about how more coal trucks are on the move . But a good number of Trump supporters doubt the mines will ever be revived : they just don \u2019 t see the economics working . Still , they back Trump because he talked about their problems when they feel virtually invisible to the national political class . More than a few supported Bernie Sanders for the same reason .\nRobin Jeran , who ran the kind of small-scale mines that once dotted West Virginia , voted for Trump but he doubts coal is making a comeback . \u201c We were very fortunate through the years to be able to work steady , but as time went on I could see it coming . The little guy \u2019 s going to get squeezed out . You don \u2019 t have the money behind you to stay in business when they keep passing more stringent laws , \u201d he said .\nJeran \u2019 s family ran 10 mines over nearly three decades . Mostly they dug several hundred feet into a hillside , employing a few dozen miners at a time . When one mine \u2019 s coal was exhausted , usually within three or four years , they moved on to another . Back then , coal provided a decent wage . \u201c Decent income . Health benefits , \u201d said Jeran . \u201c At one time we used to say that for every guy that you employed there was another eight or 10 people out there in service industries that supplied you that you fed . \u201d\nJeran went out of business in 2009 , the year Obama moved into the White House . He said his mines were killed by a confluence of low coal prices , falling demand , competition from natural gas and increased regulation , particularly after two local mine disasters . In 2006 , 12 miners were killed in an explosion at the deep Sago mine just outside Buckhannon \u2013 an operation owned by Wilbur Ross , a billionaire banker who is now Trump \u2019 s commerce secretary . Four years later , 29 men died in a coal dust explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine . The tragedies prompted new state safety regulations after it was revealed that both mines were repeatedly cited for violations . The new measures included the building of underground emergency shelters .\nJeran said it was one cost too many for small mines like his . \u201c At the time I never thought we needed any of that stuff . Still don \u2019 t . They made us spend hoards of money on shelters underground . Communication devices . Tracking devices . They can \u2019 t prove it \u2019 s saved any lives , any of this stuff . But it really added tremendous costs to a small coalmine because everybody had to have the same stuff no matter how small you were , \u201d he said . He calculates that regulation added several dollars to a ton of coal at a time when prices were rock bottom , driving his and other mines out of business .\nThen came Obama . The president did not begin coal \u2019 s troubles , but the former mine owner reckons he put the final nail in the coffin of small-scale operations with environmental regulations . \u201c He definitely destroyed the coal business . He made up his mind to do it , \u201d he said .\nBut Jeran doubts that Trump , for all his promises , can reverse the long-term decline .\n\u201c To me there \u2019 ll always be some work for coal but I don \u2019 t ever see it coming back the way it did , \u201d he said . \u201c Most of the good easy coal to mine in West Virginia is long gone so everything is more difficult , deeper , lot more rock in the coal seams . As they keep changing the power plants from coal to gas , and the gas has gotten so cheap , I think the gas is going to work the coalminers out now . \u201d\nThe loss of the mines is keenly felt . Jeran \u2019 s workers typically earned more than $ 80,000 a year . In the 1970s , pay in West Virginia was above the national average . By the turn of the millennium , with mining collapsing , wages had fallen far behind most of America and low-paying Walmart was the state \u2019 s biggest employer .\nThe numbers of people dependent on welfare , including food stamps , rose . Nearly 15 % of West Virginia residents receive disability payments , the highest of any state . The mine at Sago closed , leaving behind the hoists and headgear as markers of what once was , and a black granite memorial in the town to the dead . Other small towns just a few miles outside of Buckhannon are grappling with the consequences of lost mines as mortgage foreclosures and bankruptcies drove people from their homes and businesses .\nJeran readily admits that he does not know what the solution is , but he likes the idea of the government in the hands of a businessman with a focus on what \u2019 s good for Americans . \u201c The government wastes so much money it \u2019 s unbelievable . It just drives you crazy . We \u2019 re out trying to save the world all the time and we don \u2019 t take care of our own . We shouldn \u2019 t have people starving , homeless . Let \u2019 s shrink it back in and take care of us . My golly , this idea that we \u2019 re the know it all , good all hasn \u2019 t proved out . All we do is get our foot in the door , get a whole bunch of people killed , defending what ? What have we accomplished in Afghanistan or any of these places ? \u201d\n\u2018 Fuck the United States . They \u2019 re the most cruelest country there is \u2019\nThe belief that America \u2019 s leaders have been more interested in foreign adventures than looking after those at the bottom of the pile back home runs through many West Virginia communities .\nRicky Farnsworth flies a Confederate battle flag from an improvised steel rod flagpole outside his trailer home . When I ask why he \u2019 s hoisted such a divisive symbol in a state mostly carved out of Virginia to join the Union cause , he smiles .\n\u201c I will not fly an American flag other than that one . I would rather have a Chinese flag , a Japanese flag , a Russian flag . Fuck the United States . They \u2019 re the most cruelest country there is . Letting your own people starve and sending aid overseas . Going over and killing people in other countries and then building them back up . What business did we have in Vietnam ? What business did we have in Iraq ? \u201d he said .\nFarnsworth used to work on oil rigs but the toll of injuries , including a lost finger , and the general wearing down of his body forced him out of a job . Now , at 59 , he lives on a little more than a $ 1,000 a month in disability payments . Farnsworth is an unflinching if maverick Trump supporter . He denounces the rich but believes the billionaire president will Make America Great Again . He speaks of Obama as \u201c the black guy \u201d and said he knows for sure the former president is not American . Yet he supports Obamacare and doesn \u2019 t understand why the US can \u2019 t replicate Canada \u2019 s health system .\n\u201c Money don \u2019 t excite me . I don \u2019 t worry about it even though I don \u2019 t have it . I don \u2019 t hardly buy food because it \u2019 s too damn expensive , \u201d he said . \u201c I go to the diner and eat a little bit . Two beets , a half spoonful of bacon bits , a half spoonful of shredded cheese . I \u2019 ll put a little bit of coleslaw , a little bit of cottage cheese . Four peaches . I \u2019 ll eat that . I ate that yesterday . I ain \u2019 t eaten nothing since that . I won \u2019 t eat nothing today . That \u2019 s what I live on. \u201d That and a steady supply of chewing tobacco .\nFarnsworth sees Trump \u2019 s wealth as evidence that he is looking out for ordinary Americans .\n\u201c Why would he downgrade himself if he didn \u2019 t want to help the United States ? His home was more valuable than the White House , \u201d he said .\nThe retired oil worker regards taxes with the same scorn as much of conservative America , although his objection comes with a twist not so often heard among Republicans . Why , he asks , should the poor pay taxes when the rich don \u2019 t contribute their fair share ? Yet Farnsworth doesn \u2019 t blame Trump for avoiding taxes with his business manoeuverings .\n\u201c He didn \u2019 t pay taxes but he went by the law . He did not steal off the government . He went by the law because he was a smart man , \u201d he said .\nStill , Farnsworth isn \u2019 t keen to let the point go . He doesn \u2019 t see why the Internal Revenue Service is making demands of a man like himself getting by hand to mouth .\n\u201c Why don \u2019 t they go and get their money from the billions they spent in Iraq ? \u201d\n\u2018 I did not join the army to act as a mercenary for oil \u2019\nLike evangelicals , a clear majority of military veterans voted for Trump . Sergeant Ron Frye wasn \u2019 t one of them . The 48-year-old army veteran stepped on a booby trap in Iraq in 2003 . He spent eight months in a coma , lost the use of his legs and is now in a wheelchair . It has left him in unending pain .\n\u201c I understood Afghanistan . Iraq , I never understood why we were there . I know why the president claimed we went to Iraq but there were so many shady background issues involved in it that I \u2019 ve just come to believe that the only reason we went to Iraq was all about money and oil . I joined the army to protect America and preserve freedom for those around the world who asked for our assistance . I did not join the army to act as a mercenary for oil , \u201d he said .\n\u201c When I came back from Iraq after I got blown up , I swore I would never vote for another Republican because they \u2019 d already stolen my legs . So I supported Barack Obama . I thought he was the second coming of JFK . Well into his first term , I realised I was sadly mistaken so I said I would never support the Democratic party again , \u201d he said .\nThen came the 2016 election . \u201c I looked at it and said you can vote for the Wicked Witch of the West or you can vote for the King of the Oompa-Loompas . I finally decided on Clinton because I thought in a politically savvy sense she was far more qualified than Donald Trump . I saw how the country voted and I thought , oh my God . At first I was inclined to think we \u2019 ve elected the second Adolf Hitler . \u201d\nFrye lives in a small house on a street populated by veterans who served as far back as the second world war . His views are not widely shared either among his neighbours or many others in Buckhannon .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a loud , egotistical , self-centred cripple and I can say anything I want and nobody can do a damn thing about it because then they would be seen as being the guy who picks on the wounded vet , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s the only liberating thing about being in a wheelchair , being able to state whatever I want , however I want , without anybody trying to shout me down . \u201d\nFrye said he will give Trump six months to see if the new president is as bad as he fears , but he \u2019 s not getting his hopes up . \u201c He \u2019 s stirred up so much animosity that unless you came over on the Mayflower you can not be sure you \u2019 re not going to get targeted by him , \u201d he said . \u201c To have fought for freedom , equality , democracy \u2013 all these things held so dear \u2013 and then to have somebody being elected who seems to support the exact opposite of that \u2013 hatred , inequality , the segregation \u2026 It \u2019 s as if we \u2019 re taking a step back to the 1950s . \u201d\nFrye fears that might also apply to policies toward working conditions and the environment . He lost family in the Sago mine disaster . One of his wife \u2019 s cousins , Fred Ware , was asphyxiated and another , Randal McCloy , was the sole survivor and permanently injured .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not out to save the whales and I \u2019 m not out to hug a bunch of trees . But I certainly don \u2019 t want my children to live the way I had to live , growing up in an Irish family in West Virginia , working in the coalmines . I don \u2019 t want to see any more of my relatives die of black lung , \u201d he said . \u201c I would love to see economic growth for West Virginia . I just don \u2019 t want to see economic growth for West Virginia at the cost of West Virginia itself . There has to be a middle ground and in America finding a middle ground is probably far more difficult than any other country . \u201d\n\u2018 Now those with the most fear those with the least \u2019\nWest Virginia was once solidly Democratic . Although Trump won every county , the state has not entirely turned its back on the party . A Democrat , Jim Justice , was elected governor in the same ballot , although it helped that he is a conservative billionaire mine owner . Democrats also hold five of the six directly elected offices including secretary of state . But the GOP tide is pushing in . A Republican was elected to one of the seats in the US Senate in 2015 for the first time in 60 years and all three of the state \u2019 s seats in Congress have flipped to the party since the turn of the millennium .\n\u201c There \u2019 s always been a class and caste system . America \u2019 s supposed to be the class-free country . The only thing is the classes here have to be far more subtle , \u201d said Frye , the veteran . \u201c Now those with the most fear those with the least . And while saying that we need to equalize the system they spend all their time and resources secretly distancing themselves more to protect themselves from the hatred of the faceless majority . \u201d\nJeran , the former mine owner , reckons West Virginia should naturally lean to the Democrats . He blames Obama \u2019 s policies for the party \u2019 s fall , although he said the former president \u2019 s race contributed to the hostility towards him .\nIn central California , it 's neighbour versus neighbour on Trump Read more\nStill , there \u2019 s one Obama legacy a lot of West Virginians are not keen to see erased . Farnsworth , the Trump supporter , liked Obama \u2019 s healthcare reform although he would like to have seen it go further . \u201c The US can afford for everyone to have insurance . Canada does and these other smaller countries that ain \u2019 t as rich , they can do that . Why can \u2019 t the US ? Because it \u2019 s too mean . Highfalutin motherfuckers in the government wants to send all this aid and stuff overseas , \u201d he said .\nJeran broadly backed Obamacare . He said it \u2019 s flawed but he doesn \u2019 t want to see it swept away without an alternative . \u201c It was a good thing for people that wanted to get insurance and get it at a reasonable price . I had Obamacare when I quit for a couple of years but these insurance companies they just change stuff and they jack it up . Same with pharmacy . The drug prices in this country , it just drives you crazy , \u201d he said . \u201c To me , you got ta do something . This idea that we \u2019 re just going to get rid of Obamacare and we don \u2019 t have anything in place , I don \u2019 t like that . \u201d\nAs for Making America Great Again , Sgt Frye is doubtful . \u201c America never stopped being great . America stopped believing in itself and caring about itself , \u201d he said . \u201c We became so disgruntled and bitter and concentrated on the fact that our politicians were a bunch of lying , conniving scum that we ceased having pride in our country \u2019 s achievements and became focused on our failures . Until we learn to start being proud of the positive things we achieve , we will never be great again in our own eyes . And if you can not love yourself , how can anyone else love you ? \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a sentiment Morgan , the evangelical and conservative grandmother , agrees with \u2013 although she sees it through a different prism .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve really turned away from God as a nation and when a nation does that , God has a hard time blessing a nation that is turning its back on him , \u201d she said . \u201c I want to bring God back into our government . I know church and state to a point needs to be separated but I think it needs to come together too in order for God to bless the nation . I want to see prayer in school . Bring back those things that have been removed so that the next generation are taught godly principles . \u201d\nMorgan realises that \u2019 s a big ask , but she thinks Trump may be the man to make it happen . For all that , she can \u2019 t decide if he \u2019 s a religious man or just an opportunist .\n\u201c That \u2019 s up in the air , in my opinion . I don \u2019 t know depending on what day you ask me , \u201d she said .",

The industry helped push the claim by resisting Environmental Protection Agency regulations, which are widely viewed as a plot to make coalmining unviable.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, promised to revive the mines that once provided a good living for much of this part of Appalachia. On 28 March, he signed orders rolling back measures to combat global warming, including pollution restrictions on coal-fired power plants and lifting a moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands in an effort to boost the mining industry. The move came days after he told a rally in Kentucky that he was rolling back regulations: \u201cWe are going to put our coalminers back to work.\u201d\n\nIn the southern part of the state, people are already talking about how more coal trucks are on the move. But a good number of Trump supporters doubt the mines will ever be revived: they just don\u2019t see the economics working. Still, they back Trump because he talked about their problems when they feel virtually invisible to the national political class. More than a few supported Bernie Sanders for the same reason.\n\nRobin Jeran, who ran the kind of small-scale mines that once dotted West Virginia, voted for Trump but he doubts coal is making a comeback. \u201cWe were very fortunate through the years to be able to work steady, but as time went on I could see it coming. The little guy\u2019s going to get squeezed out. You don\u2019t have the money behind you to stay in business when they keep passing more stringent laws,\u201d he said.\n\nJeran\u2019s family ran 10 mines over nearly three decades. Mostly they dug several hundred feet into a hillside, employing a few dozen miners at a time. When one mine\u2019s coal was exhausted, usually within three or four years, they moved on to another. Back then, coal provided a decent wage. \u201cDecent income. Health benefits,\u201d said Jeran. \u201cAt one time we used to say that for every guy that you employed there was another eight or 10 people out there in service industries that supplied you that you fed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trucks move along S Kanawha Street in Buckhannon. Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The Guardian\n\nJeran went out of business in 2009, the year Obama moved into the White House. He said his mines were killed by a confluence of low coal prices, falling demand, competition from natural gas and increased regulation, particularly after two local mine disasters. In 2006, 12 miners were killed in an explosion at the deep Sago mine just outside Buckhannon \u2013 an operation owned by Wilbur Ross, a billionaire banker who is now Trump\u2019s commerce secretary. Four years later, 29 men died in a coal dust explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine. The tragedies prompted new state safety regulations after it was revealed that both mines were repeatedly cited for violations. The new measures included the building of underground emergency shelters.\n\nJeran said it was one cost too many for small mines like his. \u201cAt the time I never thought we needed any of that stuff. Still don\u2019t. They made us spend hoards of money on shelters underground. Communication devices. Tracking devices. They can\u2019t prove it\u2019s saved any lives, any of this stuff. But it really added tremendous costs to a small coalmine because everybody had to have the same stuff no matter how small you were,\u201d he said. He calculates that regulation added several dollars to a ton of coal at a time when prices were rock bottom, driving his and other mines out of business.\n\nThen came Obama. The president did not begin coal\u2019s troubles, but the former mine owner reckons he put the final nail in the coffin of small-scale operations with environmental regulations. \u201cHe definitely destroyed the coal business. He made up his mind to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Jeran doubts that Trump, for all his promises, can reverse the long-term decline.\n\n\u201cTo me there\u2019ll always be some work for coal but I don\u2019t ever see it coming back the way it did,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the good easy coal to mine in West Virginia is long gone so everything is more difficult, deeper, lot more rock in the coal seams. As they keep changing the power plants from coal to gas, and the gas has gotten so cheap, I think the gas is going to work the coalminers out now.\u201d\n\nThe loss of the mines is keenly felt. Jeran\u2019s workers typically earned more than $80,000 a year. In the 1970s, pay in West Virginia was above the national average. By the turn of the millennium, with mining collapsing, wages had fallen far behind most of America and low-paying Walmart was the state\u2019s biggest employer.\n\nThe numbers of people dependent on welfare, including food stamps, rose. Nearly 15% of West Virginia residents receive disability payments, the highest of any state. The mine at Sago closed, leaving behind the hoists and headgear as markers of what once was, and a black granite memorial in the town to the dead. Other small towns just a few miles outside of Buckhannon are grappling with the consequences of lost mines as mortgage foreclosures and bankruptcies drove people from their homes and businesses.\n\nJeran readily admits that he does not know what the solution is, but he likes the idea of the government in the hands of a businessman with a focus on what\u2019s good for Americans. \u201cThe government wastes so much money it\u2019s unbelievable. It just drives you crazy. We\u2019re out trying to save the world all the time and we don\u2019t take care of our own. We shouldn\u2019t have people starving, homeless. Let\u2019s shrink it back in and take care of us. My golly, this idea that we\u2019re the know it all, good all hasn\u2019t proved out. All we do is get our foot in the door, get a whole bunch of people killed, defending what? What have we accomplished in Afghanistan or any of these places?\u201d\n\n\u2018Fuck the United States. They\u2019re the most cruelest country there is\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump supporter Ricky Farnsworth stands for a portrait outside of his trailer in Buckhannon. Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The Guardian\n\nThe belief that America\u2019s leaders have been more interested in foreign adventures than looking after those at the bottom of the pile back home runs through many West Virginia communities.\n\nRicky Farnsworth flies a Confederate battle flag from an improvised steel rod flagpole outside his trailer home. When I ask why he\u2019s hoisted such a divisive symbol in a state mostly carved out of Virginia to join the Union cause, he smiles.\n\n\u201cI will not fly an American flag other than that one. I would rather have a Chinese flag, a Japanese flag, a Russian flag. Fuck the United States. They\u2019re the most cruelest country there is. Letting your own people starve and sending aid overseas. Going over and killing people in other countries and then building them back up. What business did we have in Vietnam? What business did we have in Iraq?\u201d he said.\n\nFarnsworth used to work on oil rigs but the toll of injuries, including a lost finger, and the general wearing down of his body forced him out of a job. Now, at 59, he lives on a little more than a $1,000 a month in disability payments. Farnsworth is an unflinching if maverick Trump supporter. He denounces the rich but believes the billionaire president will Make America Great Again. He speaks of Obama as \u201cthe black guy\u201d and said he knows for sure the former president is not American. Yet he supports Obamacare and doesn\u2019t understand why the US can\u2019t replicate Canada\u2019s health system.\n\n\u201cMoney don\u2019t excite me. I don\u2019t worry about it even though I don\u2019t have it. I don\u2019t hardly buy food because it\u2019s too damn expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cI go to the diner and eat a little bit. Two beets, a half spoonful of bacon bits, a half spoonful of shredded cheese. I\u2019ll put a little bit of coleslaw, a little bit of cottage cheese. Four peaches. I\u2019ll eat that. I ate that yesterday. I ain\u2019t eaten nothing since that. I won\u2019t eat nothing today. That\u2019s what I live on.\u201d That and a steady supply of chewing tobacco.\n\nFarnsworth sees Trump\u2019s wealth as evidence that he is looking out for ordinary Americans.\n\n\u201cWhy would he downgrade himself if he didn\u2019t want to help the United States? His home was more valuable than the White House,\u201d he said.\n\nThe retired oil worker regards taxes with the same scorn as much of conservative America, although his objection comes with a twist not so often heard among Republicans. Why, he asks, should the poor pay taxes when the rich don\u2019t contribute their fair share? Yet Farnsworth doesn\u2019t blame Trump for avoiding taxes with his business manoeuverings.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t pay taxes but he went by the law. He did not steal off the government. He went by the law because he was a smart man,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Farnsworth isn\u2019t keen to let the point go. He doesn\u2019t see why the Internal Revenue Service is making demands of a man like himself getting by hand to mouth.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they go and get their money from the billions they spent in Iraq?\u201d\n\n\u2018I did not join the army to act as a mercenary for oil\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sgt Ron Frye with his dog at his home in Buckhannon. Frye is a veteran who now uses a wheelchair after being hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The Guardian\n\nLike evangelicals, a clear majority of military veterans voted for Trump. Sergeant Ron Frye wasn\u2019t one of them. The 48-year-old army veteran stepped on a booby trap in Iraq in 2003. He spent eight months in a coma, lost the use of his legs and is now in a wheelchair. It has left him in unending pain.\n\n\u201cI understood Afghanistan. Iraq, I never understood why we were there. I know why the president claimed we went to Iraq but there were so many shady background issues involved in it that I\u2019ve just come to believe that the only reason we went to Iraq was all about money and oil. I joined the army to protect America and preserve freedom for those around the world who asked for our assistance. I did not join the army to act as a mercenary for oil,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I came back from Iraq after I got blown up, I swore I would never vote for another Republican because they\u2019d already stolen my legs. So I supported Barack Obama. I thought he was the second coming of JFK. Well into his first term, I realised I was sadly mistaken so I said I would never support the Democratic party again,\u201d he said.\n\nThen came the 2016 election. \u201cI looked at it and said you can vote for the Wicked Witch of the West or you can vote for the King of the Oompa-Loompas. I finally decided on Clinton because I thought in a politically savvy sense she was far more qualified than Donald Trump. I saw how the country voted and I thought, oh my God. At first I was inclined to think we\u2019ve elected the second Adolf Hitler.\u201d\n\nFrye lives in a small house on a street populated by veterans who served as far back as the second world war. His views are not widely shared either among his neighbours or many others in Buckhannon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a loud, egotistical, self-centred cripple and I can say anything I want and nobody can do a damn thing about it because then they would be seen as being the guy who picks on the wounded vet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only liberating thing about being in a wheelchair, being able to state whatever I want, however I want, without anybody trying to shout me down.\u201d\n\nFrye said he will give Trump six months to see if the new president is as bad as he fears, but he\u2019s not getting his hopes up. \u201cHe\u2019s stirred up so much animosity that unless you came over on the Mayflower you cannot be sure you\u2019re not going to get targeted by him,\u201d he said. \u201cTo have fought for freedom, equality, democracy \u2013 all these things held so dear \u2013 and then to have somebody being elected who seems to support the exact opposite of that \u2013 hatred, inequality, the segregation \u2026 It\u2019s as if we\u2019re taking a step back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nFrye fears that might also apply to policies toward working conditions and the environment. He lost family in the Sago mine disaster. One of his wife\u2019s cousins, Fred Ware, was asphyxiated and another, Randal McCloy, was the sole survivor and permanently injured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not out to save the whales and I\u2019m not out to hug a bunch of trees. But I certainly don\u2019t want my children to live the way I had to live, growing up in an Irish family in West Virginia, working in the coalmines. I don\u2019t want to see any more of my relatives die of black lung,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to see economic growth for West Virginia. I just don\u2019t want to see economic growth for West Virginia at the cost of West Virginia itself. There has to be a middle ground and in America finding a middle ground is probably far more difficult than any other country.\u201d\n\n\u2018Now those with the most fear those with the least\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Are you Saved?\u2019 ask signs on the way out of Buckhannon. Photograph: Stephanie Strasburg/The Guardian\n\nWest Virginia was once solidly Democratic. Although Trump won every county, the state has not entirely turned its back on the party. A Democrat, Jim Justice, was elected governor in the same ballot, although it helped that he is a conservative billionaire mine owner. Democrats also hold five of the six directly elected offices including secretary of state. But the GOP tide is pushing in. A Republican was elected to one of the seats in the US Senate in 2015 for the first time in 60 years and all three of the state\u2019s seats in Congress have flipped to the party since the turn of the millennium.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been a class and caste system. America\u2019s supposed to be the class-free country. The only thing is the classes here have to be far more subtle,\u201d said Frye, the veteran. \u201cNow those with the most fear those with the least. And while saying that we need to equalize the system they spend all their time and resources secretly distancing themselves more to protect themselves from the hatred of the faceless majority.\u201d\n\nJeran, the former mine owner, reckons West Virginia should naturally lean to the Democrats. He blames Obama\u2019s policies for the party\u2019s fall, although he said the former president\u2019s race contributed to the hostility towards him.\n\nIn central California, it's neighbour versus neighbour on Trump Read more\n\nStill, there\u2019s one Obama legacy a lot of West Virginians are not keen to see erased. Farnsworth, the Trump supporter, liked Obama\u2019s healthcare reform although he would like to have seen it go further. \u201cThe US can afford for everyone to have insurance. Canada does and these other smaller countries that ain\u2019t as rich, they can do that. Why can\u2019t the US? Because it\u2019s too mean. Highfalutin motherfuckers in the government wants to send all this aid and stuff overseas,\u201d he said.\n\nJeran broadly backed Obamacare. He said it\u2019s flawed but he doesn\u2019t want to see it swept away without an alternative. \u201cIt was a good thing for people that wanted to get insurance and get it at a reasonable price. I had Obamacare when I quit for a couple of years but these insurance companies they just change stuff and they jack it up. Same with pharmacy. The drug prices in this country, it just drives you crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you gotta do something. This idea that we\u2019re just going to get rid of Obamacare and we don\u2019t have anything in place, I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nAs for Making America Great Again, Sgt Frye is doubtful. \u201cAmerica never stopped being great. America stopped believing in itself and caring about itself,\u201d he said. \u201cWe became so disgruntled and bitter and concentrated on the fact that our politicians were a bunch of lying, conniving scum that we ceased having pride in our country\u2019s achievements and became focused on our failures. Until we learn to start being proud of the positive things we achieve, we will never be great again in our own eyes. And if you cannot love yourself, how can anyone else love you?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a sentiment Morgan, the evangelical and conservative grandmother, agrees with \u2013 although she sees it through a different prism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really turned away from God as a nation and when a nation does that, God has a hard time blessing a nation that is turning its back on him,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to bring God back into our government. I know church and state to a point needs to be separated but I think it needs to come together too in order for God to bless the nation. I want to see prayer in school. Bring back those things that have been removed so that the next generation are taught godly principles.\u201d\n\nMorgan realises that\u2019s a big ask, but she thinks Trump may be the man to make it happen. For all that, she can\u2019t decide if he\u2019s a religious man or just an opportunist.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s up in the air, in my opinion. I don\u2019t know depending on what day you ask me,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n",
