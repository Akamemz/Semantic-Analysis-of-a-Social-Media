A few days before , friends of the married father of two had recommended the Turkish spa as treatment for his long-term joint and muscle troubles . The nighttime visit had proved to be a disastrous mistake .\nHeavily armed riot police herded dozens of terrified men dressed in just the spa \u2019 s checkered towels through the changing rooms into waiting trucks . Some who were wearing clothes were forced to strip half-naked in front of the TV crew that kept filming , even as the prisoners tried to cover their faces .\nMohamed found himself swept along with others in the chaos . In the corner , Egyptian TV presenter Mona Iraqi quietly recorded the horrific raid on her iPhone , photos she gleefully posted on her public Facebook page later that evening .\nThe Dec. 7 raid , in which 26 men were detained , was the single largest mass arrest of alleged gays the country has seen in decades . The last time there was a raid of this scale was in 2001 , when 52 men were arrested on Queen Boat , a floating disco on the Nile . The resulting trial in that case sparked an international uproar and marred Egypt \u2019 s human-rights record forever .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not gay , I \u2019 m married with kids . I wasn \u2019 t doing anything illegal in that bathhouse , I was just sitting there , \u201d Mohamed told his lawyer from his prison cell . But now his life is in tatters\u2014he is facing prison time , he could lose his job , his reputation is in ruins , and his family has been publicly humiliated .\nAll 26 men were in court last week charged with \u201c debauchery , \u201d all of them subjected to humiliating forensic \u201c anal checks \u201d to determine their sexuality .\nSince the ouster of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 , the authorities have launched the harshest crackdown on the LGBT community since the days of toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak , as the country \u2019 s \u201c morality police \u201d look to boost their popularity ratings with the conservative Egyptian public .\nThere have been at least 50 cases similar to the bathhouse raid in the last 18 months , human-rights groups estimate . This means more than 150 gay and transgender people are languishing in the country \u2019 s jail cells despite the fact that , technically , homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt .\nThese days the Egyptian pro-regime media are increasingly colluding with the security forces who invite them to broadcast the raids\u2014even thought that \u2019 s illegal . In Mohamed \u2019 s case , TV host Iraqi instigated the bust : She had sent undercover camera crews to the bathhouse weeks before to spy on the men and reportedly alerted the police to what she claimed was a \u201c den of inequity . \u201d\n\u201c She worked together with the police\u2014it was a publicity stunt and without her the arrests simply wouldn \u2019 t have happened , \u201d said Scott Long , a rights activist closely following the cases .\nThe only repercussions Iraqi has faced are outside of Egypt , as she lost her place in an upcoming Swiss Film Festival , he added .\n\u201c Internationally there has been a lot of horror and contempt for her actions , domestically very little , \u201d he said .\nThe 26 were beaten by the bailiffs as they filed into a caged dock , sobbing , on Dec. 21 . Through the chaos , as police tried to drown out the screams of the distraught families , one of the defendants said they had been badly beaten in detention and forced to sleep on their stomachs .\nMohamed \u2019 s lawyer , who works for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and has represented many other men sent to trial on similar charges , has little hope they will be acquitted .\n\u201c It \u2019 s extremely frustrating\u2014for a start , we can not defend them as we still don \u2019 t have the case files or know the proper charges . And it comes after several similar cases where people have been jailed on no evidence , \u201d Mohamed Bakir told me after the hearing .\nJust last month , eight men were sentenced to three years in jail for appearing in a video the judge said depicted the country \u2019 s first gay marriage . In the 60-second clip posted on YouTube , two men wearing tuxedoes exchanged rings , hugged and kissed on the cheek while their friends partied in the background on a Nile riverboat .\nThey were found guilty of practicing habitual debauchery and inciting others to sexual deviance because of the footage .\n\u201c There is nothing whatsoever in the video which supports the charges\u2014it shows no criminal activity , \u201d Bakir said .\nThe eight appealed the verdict , which was reduced to one year in prison this week but it should have been an acquittal , the lawyer added .\nThe televised raids\u2014broadcast on national television to dramatic cop-show music\u2014 and high-profile court cases are driving the terrified community further underground . The younger members , who , under toppled President Morsi , had felt secure enough to start a fledging gay-rights movement on social media , now say it is too dangerous to even meet online .\nThe police have stepped up their Internet surveillance capabilities , forcing gay dating apps like Grindr to warn their members about publishing addresses or phone numbers on their profiles . They even switched off their location service\u2014one of the main perks of the program .\n\u201c It \u2019 s terrifying and crazy\u2014to know that you are targeted by your own government for committing no crime other than being sexually different , \u201d said Amr Ahmed , a young gay man who has frequently visited the bathhouse where the men were arrested .\nThe 25-year-old student said it was one of the few safe meeting venues left for the poorer members of the community who can not afford the expensive bars in Cairo \u2019 s wealthier districts , where the police are paid to turn a blind eye .\nHe said the new collaboration of the media with the police was the most worrying development as it meant , aside from a few human-rights lawyers , there is no one left to hold the security apparatus to account and to protect the vulnerable community .\n\u201c Mona Iraqi is responsible for 25 families losing their lives , \u201d he said , speaking figuratively . \u201c In my eyes she killed those people\u2026 exposing a gay person like this is akin to torturing him slowly to death . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s simple , we are being hunted\u2014and that , apparently , makes good TV . But it \u2019 s not journalism , if anyone has committed a crime it is her , \u201d said Ahmed .\nIraqi faced an enormous backlash internationally for her actions , which she justified by saying the footage was part of a series of programs aimed at educating the population on the spread of AIDS .\nEgypt has a comparatively low number of HIV cases compared to the rest of Africa , with just 11,000 infected people nationwide .
