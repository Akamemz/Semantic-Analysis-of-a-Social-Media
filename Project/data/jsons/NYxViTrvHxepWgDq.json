Sure , some Democratic politicians \u201c sling mud , \u201d but the \u201c professional left \u201d ( as they are often derisively called ) spend too much time debating the exactitude of certain issues and not enough time shutting down the bad ideas of the opposition . It might speak well to one \u2019 s character , but it \u2019 s an ineffective way to do battle . There is a place for self-examination , but it \u2019 s not on the battlefield . Sometimes the proper reaction to cruelty or stupid ideas is disgust or even a well-timed insult . For many on the left this art is sadly as dead as the late hero of mine quoted above .\nI got married , dropped out of college , joined the military and became a father all before I was 21 years old , and I spent the next 20 years dealing with my early missteps . It was a painful climb , but one benefit of the circuitous route I took is that I understand the angry , white and rural right wing of America better than most . It \u2019 s a group that grows ever more desperate and irrational no matter which way the electoral winds blow .\nAs a member of the frothing right wing , I always spouted nonsense , even when I wasn \u2019 t sure I believed it . Sometimes I would throw out really crazy stuff just to see how it fit the big picture and sometimes to get a rise from the opposition . Rhetorical bomb throwing is well respected on the right , and it \u2019 s not always a bad thing . There is nothing wrong with trying out ideas , letting them roll off the tongue to see how they sound . I \u2019 m always playing with ideas , most of which get discarded before I let myself believe them or write them down . There is one caveat to this and that \u2019 s the racist , hateful and homophobic rants that have become too common among the worst of the Tea Party . This ugly side of conservative rage is one of the major factors that drove me ( and many others ) away from right-wing politics .\nWhen I lived conservative values , I attended many events with like-minded people . Conservative movements foster a herd mentality . Even when someone stood up to \u201c lead , \u201d he or she often regurgitated well-accepted talking points while crowds nodded in unison . Listen to talk radio or watch Fox News , and you can barely tally the number of times you hear , \u201c yes , I think that \u2019 s true. \u201d A perfect example of thoughtless regurgitation is when callers on talk radio mention \u201c Saul Alinsky Democrats. \u201d Still others like to sling the insult of \u201c Obama \u2019 s Chicago political machine , \u201d with no context whatsoever . I \u2019 m going to make the obvious point that few if any of these callers have read one word of Alinsky , and fewer still have any direct , pointed or even third-hand knowledge of \u201c Chicago politics. \u201d These goofy phrases have become totems of the insider , and like children , these listeners mindlessly repeat what someone else has said as if they had insight .\nNow that I \u2019 ve been in the liberal camp for a few years , I \u2019 ve noticed the complete opposite with the politically engaged left . They often identify as \u201c contrarian. \u201d They question everything and have a hard time taking a firm stand , even when 70 % of the public is with them ( on minimum wage , for instance ) . In an ideological battle , the tendency toward inclusion and reflection can become a handicap . As a side effect of all this soul-searching , the left becomes ineffectual at fighting even the worst excesses on the right . I \u2019 m boiling this down to a false dichotomy to illustrate a point . Of course there is every gradation of political belief on the right and left ; yet our system itself is incapable of nuance , because only one side has even heard of the word .\nMost people know that individuals will suffer because of the results of the latest midterm election . People won \u2019 t get health care and some will lose food stamps . Discrimination will find a better foothold and the advance of science will lose ground . People I love , personally , will be vilified for being gay , because conservative voices of discrimination will feel empowered to act like jerks .
