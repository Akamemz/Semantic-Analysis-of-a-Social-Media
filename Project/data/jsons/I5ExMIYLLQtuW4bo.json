Wigfall of Texas in December 1860 , as an intended warning to those who doubted the economic viability of secessionism . Like many southerners , Wigfall subscribed to the \u201c King Cotton \u201d thesis : the belief that slave-produced cotton commanded a controlling position over the American economy and indeed the world \u2019 s commercial engines . Developed in the 1850s by political economist David Christy and championed by the radical pro-slavery politician James Henry Hammond , that argument was to be the nascent Confederacy \u2019 s trump card \u2014 an engine of global wealth in which all other economic activities were intertwined . Indeed , no nation would dare make war upon plantation slavery , for if the South suspended its production , in the words of Hammond , \u201c we could bring the whole world to our feet . \u201d\nThe strategy failed . The secessionists effectively self-embargoed what remained of their export crop in the wake of the war \u2019 s physical destruction and the Union \u2019 s blockade , and attempts to draw the European powers into the war on the Confederacy \u2019 s behalf were unsuccessful . King Cotton , in practice , proved nothing more than part self-delusion and part racist propaganda to rationalize the supposed economic necessity of chattel slavery . Modern empirical analysis has similarly debunked its claims : As Harvard economist Nathan Nunn has demonstrated , a strong negative relationship exists between the historical existence of slavery in a county or state and its level of income , persisting to the present day .\nYet despite its historical untenability , the economic reasoning behind King Cotton has undergone a surprising \u2014 perhaps unwitting \u2014 rehabilitation through a modern genre of scholarly works known as the new history of capitalism ( NHC ) . While NHC historians reject the pro-slavery thrust of Wigfall and Hammond \u2019 s bluster , they recast slave-produced cotton as \u201c not just as an integral part of American capitalism , but . . . its very essence , \u201d to quote Harvard \u2019 s Sven Beckert . Cornell historian Ed Baptist goes even further , describing slavery as the indispensable causal driver behind America \u2019 s wealth today . Cotton production , he contends , was \u201c absolutely necessary \u201d for the Western world to break the \u201c 10,000-year Malthusian cycle of agriculture . \u201d\nAnd this same NHC literature provides the scholarly foundation of the ballyhooed New York Times \u2019 1619 Project \u2014 specifically , its foray into the economics of slavery . Guided by this rehabilitated version of King Cotton , Princeton sociologist Matthew Desmond enlists the horrors of the plantation system to launch a blistering attack on modern American capitalism .\nDesmond projects slavery \u2019 s legacy onto a litany of tropes about rising inequality , the decline of labor-union power , environmental destruction , and the 2008 financial crisis . The intended message is clear : Modern capitalism carries with it the stain of slavery , and its putative excesses are proof of its continued brutality . It follows that only by abandoning the free market and embracing political redistribution will we ever atone for this tainted inheritance .\nIt \u2019 s not just the New York Times that uses NHC scholarship to distort the economic history of the U.S. At a congressional hearing earlier this summer , journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates enlisted another of Baptist \u2019 s claims to argue for reparations . \u201c By 1836 more than $ 600 million , almost half of the economic activity in the United States , derived directly or indirectly from the cotton produced by the million-odd slaves , \u201d Coates said .\nThis stunning statistic quickly became one of the most memorable sound bites of the occasion . It is also unambiguously false \u2014 the result of Baptist double- and triple-counting intermediate transactions from cotton production to artificially increase its economic share . Through an elementary accounting error , Baptist had inflated the actual size of the cotton sector by almost tenfold . At approximately 5 to 6 percent of the antebellum economy , cotton did indeed constitute a major output , roughly comparable in size to the northern-dominated railroad sector . It was not , however , the commercial monarch of either Confederate fantasy or Baptist \u2019 s revisionism .\nDubious statistical claims and shoddy research practices are alarmingly common in the broader NHC literature . Those who rely on it repeat these mistakes . In the 1619 Project , Desmond uses another of Baptist \u2019 s stats to attribute a 400 percent increase in the daily yield of cotton-picking between 1800 and 1860 to the systematization of whipping and torture as a means of increasing production . This \u201c calibrated torture \u201d thesis forms the central claim of Baptist \u2019 s 2014 book The Half Has Never Been Told , purporting to show that slave-based production was a capitalistic enterprise at its core and , furthermore , that modern industrial-management techniques ( the recording of daily outputs , the comparative tracking of employee productivity , the keeping of double-entry accounting books ) take a page from the most evil chapter of American history .\nYet again , Baptist \u2019 s thesis is built on misinterpreted evidence \u2014 or perhaps intentional deception . He bases his argument on the empirical work of economists Alan Olmstead and Paul Rhode , who assembled decades of plantation records to study the growth in cotton-crop yields before the Civil War . Olmstead and Rhode discovered the same 400 percent increase in cotton-picking rates yet found a completely different cause : The yields grew primarily as a result of technological improvements to the crop from cross-breeding different strains of cotton seed .\nOlmstead and Rhode published a stinging rebuke of Baptist \u2019 s work , showing empirically that cotton-picking yields tended to follow daily variations across the crop season , not Baptist \u2019 s posited use of a torture-enforced quota system . In addition to his faulty GDP statistics , they showed that Baptist severely overstated the amount of wealth tied up in slavery . \u201c The upshot , \u201d they note , \u201c is that slaves represented an important share of U.S. wealth but not nearly as great as Baptist claimed . \u201d\nThey also uncovered evidence of Baptist massaging the details of primary-source accounts such as slave narratives to bolster his thesis . This included adding words to slave testimonies and blending passages from disparate sources to change their meaning . These suspicious edits make accounts of the treatment of slaves appear more similar to modern-day managerial tactics .\nThe economists do not contest or downplay the violent reality of plantation life , acknowledging openly that the widespread \u201c use of violence or the threat of violence increased slave output. \u201d But they document several instances of Baptist playing fast and loose with the evidence , either to exaggerate the resemblance of chattel slavery to modern managerial practices or to inflate the size of the plantation system and treat it as the single dominant economic force in antebellum America .\nCuriously , participants of the 1619 Project evince little awareness of the deep historical deficiencies in Baptist \u2019 s work or of similar problems among the other NHC scholars on whom they rest their case .
