At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\nRegarding the larger question of the attorney general \u2019 s powers over special counsel investigations , some note that \u201c the special counsel regulations [ were ] produced in 1999 by Janet Reno \u2019 s Department of Justice under Bill Clinton \u2019 s administration\u2026 For the drafters of the special counsel regulations then , the goal was to create a mechanism that would still allow investigation of the president , but would prevent future Starrs from going on what the Clinton administration perceived as witch hunts against future presidents . Putting the special counsel under the supervision of the attorney general was the centerpiece of the strategy\u2026 \u201c Somehow , in the course of building up trust in Mueller over the last two years , many Democrats conveniently forgot that the regulations drafted by Democrats would allow the attorney general to minimize or even subvert Mueller \u2019 s findings\u2026 Blame the regulations for Barr \u2019 s distortions \u2014 and fix them . Rest assured , there will be a next time. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c There was a tortured exchange about the fact that , as Mueller details , Trump instructed then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn to have Mueller fired , and then when that was reported in the press , instructed McGahn to deny it publicly . The report even describes Trump insisting to McGahn that because he had not used the word \u2018 fire , \u2019 that meant he didn \u2019 t really tell McGahn to have Mueller fired , and that meant McGahn could publicly insist that Trump never told him to have Mueller fired . McGahn , perhaps realizing how absurd that was , refused\u2026 As Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-R.I. ) later said about a separate matter , \u2018 That \u2019 s some masterful hairsplitting. \u2019 \u201d Paul Waldman , Washington Post\n\u201c Barr 's Senate testimony on Wednesday was a master class in obfuscation , backtracking and blame-shifting\u2026 When asked how a political campaign should react if approached by a foreign national offering dirt , Barr did n't give the only correct and sensible answer -- \u2018 run and call the FBI \u2019 -- but instead twisted himself in a pretzel , saying the person should first try to ascertain if the foreigner is an intel agent . And Barr pretended not to understand what basic words such as \u2018 receptive \u2019 and \u2018 suggest \u2019 mean , when Democrats had the nerve to use such \u2018 technical \u2019 terms. \u201d Elie Honig , CNN\n\u201c For an institutionalist like Mr. Mueller , who never once spoke up to defend himself or his work from relentless attacks from the president and his Republican allies , the letter is an unusual ( and welcome ) breach of protocol\u2026 The regulations governing Mr. Mueller \u2019 s work call for a \u2018 confidential \u2019 report to the attorney general at the conclusion of the inquiry , which the attorney general may then release if he determined it \u2018 would be in the public interest. \u2019 That Mr. Mueller quoted from this regulatory language in his letter to Mr. Barr shows that he cares about rules , perhaps to a fault . But it also shows that Mr. Mueller sensed the urgency of his conclusions \u2014 and that he couldn \u2019 t sit idly by as the chief legal officer of the United States actively undermined them. \u201d Editorial Board , New York Times\n\u201c The Barr memo was worded and released in such a way that implied Mueller had given Trump a pass on obstruction , a point which was picked up in news coverage of Barr \u2019 s description . When the Mueller report itself became public this month however , it became clear that Mueller had compiled a substantial obstruction case , leaving it to Congress to decide whether to pursue it . Barr \u2019 s release of the report \u2019 s findings\u2026 went to great lengths to set a narrative that Trump was in the clear and give it time to congeal well before there was any information available to refute Trump \u2019 s barrage of self-exculpatory tweets. \u201d Elliot Hannon , Slate\n\u201c Barr said on Wednesday that he felt releasing parts of the report piecemeal would simply confuse the public . But that same critique could be leveled even more powerfully at his own , misleading-by-omission summary\u2026 Even if no specific sentence in the letter was wrong , it misleadingly downplayed the gravity and scope of the report , and misrepresented the thinking behind Mueller \u2019 s decision not to bring obstruction charges\u2026 as a side-by-side comparison of Barr \u2019 s and Mueller \u2019 s words shows , the attorney general selectively quoted from the report , and took many of those quotations out of context . The result was , as Mueller noted , that the public was misled about the contents of the report. \u201d David A.

Barr replied that he did not know whether Mueller agreed . Democrats now contend that Barr must have known Mueller disagreed because he had Mueller \u2019 s letter . But Mueller \u2019 s letter doesn \u2019 t say he disagreed with Barr \u2019 s conclusion\u2026 Mueller \u2019 s complaint is that Barr \u2018 did not fully capture the context \u2019 of Mueller \u2019 s magnum opus \u2013 the \u2018 nature and substance \u2019 of the report\u2026\n\u201c Parsed carefully ( which you have to do with the special counsel \u2019 s Jesuitical work ) , Mueller is precisely not saying that Barr misrepresented his key findings . He is saying that he and the Clinton/Obama minions he recruited to staff the case wrote the report with a certain mood music in mind . To their chagrin , Barr gave us just the no-crime bottom line . \u201d\n\u201c Read the supposedly damning exchange with Sen Chris Van Hollen.Barr is never asked whether Mueller is unhappy with his letter , just whether he \u2019 s unhappy with his conclusions , meaning his decision not to charge the president with obstruction\u2026 There \u2019 s another exchange with Rep . Charlie Crist that people are also focusing on . Barr is asked about anonymous officials from the Mueller probe telling the press they are unhappy with his summary letter . Barr , correctly , says he doesn \u2019 t know their discontents ( he presumably didn \u2019 t talk to any of them about this , and wouldn \u2019 t know anyway since they were anonymous ) . \u201d\nMoreover , \u201c Mr .
