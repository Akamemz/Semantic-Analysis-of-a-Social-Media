    "content_original": "Watch the first episode of Free Speech Rules, a new video series on free speech and the law that's written by Eugene Volokh, the Gary T. Schwartz Distinguished Professor of Law at UCLA, and the co-founder of the Volokh Conspiracy, which is hosted at Reason.com.\n\nThe first episode looks at the seven things you should know about how the First Amendment is applied in schools:\n\nScript:\n\nHere are the Seven Rules of Free Speech in Schools\n\n1. Political and religious speech is protected (Mostly)\n\nStudents, from first grade to twelfth, can't be punished based on their political or religious speech. As the Supreme Court said in the Tinker case, \"It can hardly be argued that \u2026 students \u2026 shed their constitutional rights\u2026 at the schoolhouse gate.\"\n\nThis protects, for instance,\n\nWearing black armbands to protest a war\n\nDistributing religious messages to classmates between classes.\n\nOr criticizing a teacher over lunch.\n\n2. Disruptive speech is not protected\n\nBut schools can punish speech that \"materially disrupts schoolwork,\" for instance because it prompts fights.\n\nThat's why some lower courts have let schools ban clothing that displays Confederate flags, and in one case even clothing that displays an American flag on Cinco de Mayo, when that display led to violence.\n\nThat's a kind of \"heckler's veto,\" where threats against a speaker are used by the government to justify restricting the speaker rather than the threateners. Usually the government can't impose such a heckler's veto\u2014but the rule in schools seems to be different.\n\nThat may not seem right to you, but I don't make the law\u2014I just make videos about it.\n\n3. Vulgar or sexual speech is not protected\n\nSchools can also punish students for using vulgarities or sexual innuendos. So if you do criticize that teacher over lunch, be\u2026 you know\u2026 polite about it.\n\n4. Praising drugs is not protected\n\nSchools can punish speech that seems to praise drug use, and probably also alcohol use and other crimes, at least when the speech doesn't seem political. That's from Morse v. Frederick, where the Supreme Court said a school could suspend a student for holding up a banner that read \"BONG HiTS 4 JESUS.\" Yes, this is a real case. In fact, you actually can find audio of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer saying (audio: \"Bong Hits for Jesus, heh, heh, heh\"). Which is completely surreal.\n\nSo \"legalize marijuana\" is probably okay; while \"marijuana is awesome\" probably isn't.\n\n5. Official school newspapers are the school's own speech\n\nYou may have the right to speak at school, but you don't have the right so speak in the school newspaper. Courts see the newspaper as the school's own speech, even if students are the ones who write it. The principal has ultimate control over what goes in the newspaper, and can delete or edit any article for pretty much any reason.\n\n6. This Only Applies to Public Schools\n\nEverything said so far deals with public schools. Under the so-called \"state action doctrine\" the First Amendment doesn't limit private schools, even ones that get tax breaks or government funds.\n\nThe first words of the First Amendment are \"Congress shall make no law \u2026\"\u2014that applies to the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment basically says no \"state\" shall violate people's rights\u2014that applies the First Amendment to state and local governments. But the Constitution generally doesn't constrain private property owners, private landlords, private schools, or anyone else.\n\nThat's why, when your parents told you to stop saying rude things at the dinner table, and you asked, \"What about my First Amendment rights?,\" they said, \"Let's talk about the state action doctrine.\"\n\nOr at least, that's what they should have said.\n\n7. California is different\n\nAnd\u2026it's all different in California. Sure, everything is different in California, but what I mean is that everything I've said so far is the constitutional minimum that all states must provide. Some states have passed laws that provide more protection to students. In California, for instance,\n\nHigh school students generally can't be punished for their speech even if it provokes other students into acting disruptively.\n\nThey generally can't be punished for speech about drugs or alcohol, or even vulgar speech\n\nAnd public school newspapers are mostly free from being censored by the administration. Student newspapers are protected in some other states, too\n\nIndeed, in California, all the student speech protections\u2014but not the student newspaper speech protections\u2014apply to private high school students as well (but not in religious high schools.)\n\nSo there you have it:\n\nPolitical and religious speech is protected, but not Disruptive speech, Vulgar speech, sexual speech, or speech praising drugs.\n\nAlso, official school newspapers are the school's own speech, this stuff really only applies to Public Schools, and of course, California is different\n\nThat's the law of free speech in school, cobbled together by the Court and a few legislatures over the last 50 years or so.\n\nWritten by Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment law professor at UCLA.\n\nProduced and edited by Austin Bragg, who is not.\n\nThis is not legal advice.\n\nIf this were legal advice, it would be followed by a bill.\n\nPlease use responsibly.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel.\n\nLike us on Facebook.\n\nFollow us on Twitter.\n\nSubscribe to our podcast at iTunes.",
