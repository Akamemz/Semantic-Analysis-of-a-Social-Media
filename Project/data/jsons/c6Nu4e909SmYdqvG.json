It was pointed out that Republicans in favour of banning abortion are by and large against banning guns because , by their own logic , \u201c banning things doesn \u2019 t work \u201d .\nIt was observed that the \u201c life \u201d of a six-week-old bunch of cells is precious to these men , but the life of a child born to a mother of no means , in a state that voted to repeal Obamacare \u2013 that notional kid , not so much . And while the point was made that no one who has watched a woman struggle through labour could , in good conscience , criminalise her disinclination to do so , these arguments seemed to me bizarre , premised on the notion that the men in Alabama were acting in good faith ; that they had the health of anyone but themselves in mind .\nNo one at this point in the US abortion debate can believe that the foetus is the focus . It \u2019 s not about the foetus , it \u2019 s about the woman . An abortion ban as radical as the one voted for in Alabama is about the elimination of women \u2013 particularly poor women \u2013 as a threat to the social order ; it is a measure designed to ensure that poor people stay poor , and women stay home . Trying to shame abortion-banners for unfairness to women is like trying to shame advocates of mandatory minimum sentencing for causing the large-scale incarceration of black people .

But this is how the law in Alabama felt \u2013 to the extent that to lose control of one \u2019 s reproductive health is to lose control of one \u2019 s life , or that a woman without means to travel will be forced to carry a baby with severe fetal abnormalities to term , or simply that the consequence of sex is once again borne by the woman \u2013 all the things that were supposed to have been banished in 1973 .\nIt will be stuck in federal district court for years and will probably not even reach the supreme court docket .
