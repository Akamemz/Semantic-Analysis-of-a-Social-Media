    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A deeply divided Supreme Court upheld President Donald Trump 's immigration travel ban against predominantly Muslim countries Tuesday as a legitimate exercise of executive branch authority .\nThe 5-4 ruling reverses a series of lower court decisions that struck down the ban as illegal or unconstitutional . It hands a major victory to Trump , who initiated the battle to ban travelers a week after assuming office last year . It was a defeat for Hawaii and other states that challenged the action , as well as immigration rights groups .\n`` In this era of worldwide terrorism and extremist movements bent on harming innocent civilians , we must properly vet those coming into our country , '' the president said . `` This ruling is also a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country . ''\nThe president vowed to ban Muslims during the 2016 presidential campaign and made similar statements on Twitter after his election . The high court said those statements did not constitute evidence of religious discrimination .\nChief Justice John Roberts issued the opinion , supported by the court 's other four conservatives \u2014 a majority that has held through a dozen 5-4 cases this term . He said the ban 's restrictions are limited to countries designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks . He noted that Trump 's latest version followed a worldwide review process by several government agencies .\n`` The proclamation is squarely within the scope of presidential authority , '' the chief justice said . Claims of religious bias against Muslims do not hold up , he said , against `` a sufficient national security justification . ''\nHowever , Roberts said , `` We express no view on the soundness of the policy . '' Justice Anthony Kennedy , in a brief concurring opinion , referred obliquely to the potential relevance of Trump 's statements about religion .\n`` There are numerous instances in which the statements and actions of government officials are not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention , '' Kennedy wrote . `` That does not mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects . ''\nThe court 's four liberal justices dissented , and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor read excerpts from the bench , a rare occurrence . Breyer , joined by Justice Elena Kagan , found `` evidence of anti-religious bias '' that he said was worth a second go-round at the federal district court level .\nSotomayor 's dissent was lengthier , and she spoke in court for about 20 minutes . Extensively quoting Trump 's words during and after the 2016 campaign , she wrote , `` A reasonable observer would conclude that the proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus . '' She was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .\n`` What began as a policy explicitly 'calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States ' has since morphed into a 'proclamation ' putatively based on national-security concerns , '' Sotomayor said . `` But this new window dressing can not conceal an unassailable fact : the words of the president and his advisers create the strong perception that the proclamation is contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus against Islam and its followers . ''\nThe legal battle began immediately after Trump issued his first travel ban in January 2017 . That 90-day ban on travelers from Iran , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen , and a 120-day ban on refugees worldwide , was struck down by federal district and appeals courts the following month .\nTrump 's second version , issued in March 2017 , dropped Iraq from the list of affected nations and exempted visa- and green-card-holders .

In December , the justices allowed it to go into effect , and in January , they scheduled it for oral argument .\nHanging in the balance were nearly 150 million residents of Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria and Yemen . Chad , also majority-Muslim , was removed from the list in April . North Korea and Venezuela are not part of the legal battle .\nIn his 39-page opinion , Roberts said the travel ban `` is expressly premised on legitimate purposes : preventing entry of nationals who can not be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices .

On that ground , Roberts said , the ban `` says nothing about religion '' \u2013 and only 8 % of the world 's Muslim population is affected .\nThroughout his opinion , Roberts praised the administration 's `` comprehensive '' review of `` every single '' country 's vetting procedures , which was followed by `` extensive '' findings and a 12-page proclamation he called `` more detailed that any prior order a president has issued '' for similar purposes .\nThe chief justice scolded Justice Sotomayor 's dissent for comparing Trump 's policy to the internment of Japanese Americans that was upheld by the Supreme Court during World War II .
