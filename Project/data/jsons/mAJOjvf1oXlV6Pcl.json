Should our elected lawmakers take action to reduce suicides among military veterans ? Should Congress help our farmers compete on the world stage and assist small businesses and entrepreneurs with a regulatory and tax burden that is quite frankly too high ?\nWhere are statesmen and stateswomen in Congress ?
