But when the 1,000 people surveyed in March were asked about the influence the United States currently has on economic conditions in Mexico , views were mixed . One-third of Mexicans say the United States is having a positive impact on national economic conditions in Mexico , while 28 % think the United States is having a negative impact .\nThe United States and Mexico are bound by a border which has made for a dysfunctional relationship over the years , especially when it comes to immigration .

Immigration\n\nThe situation:\n\nThe United States and Mexico are bound by a border which has made for a dysfunctional relationship over the years, especially when it comes to immigration.
