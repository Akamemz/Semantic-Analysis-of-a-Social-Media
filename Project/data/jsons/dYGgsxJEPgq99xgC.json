    "content": "Every time Donald Trump tweets , there is a race to respond . The resulting conversation is typically hateful and childish .\n\u201c Next time there 's a flood about to happen in your town , just pretend its fake news and die , \u201d one user lobbed at another in a typical exchange . \u201c Ha ha ha dumb faggot . That 's all you liberal ass has ? You believe every thing you see , \u201d came the response .\nWhy do we talk to each other like this ? Since last fall \u2019 s election , there has been bombast from both sides online , on social media sites , chat forums , and news comment sections . Libtard . Deplorable . Hillbot . Trumpkin . Snowflake . Nazi . Cuck . Uneducated . The latter term is most often applied with a wide and condescending brush to many living in the South or the Midwest , as a more delicate way of saying \u201c stupid \u201d or \u201c simple \u201d in the spirit of the phrase \u201c flyover states. \u201d Meanwhile , conservatives crow about drinking the tears of liberals mourning over Trump \u2019 s latest cabinet appointment .\n@ VeeVee @ realDonaldTrump you rush to be first to respond to POTUS and then bitch about what he has to say . Jesus , nobody wants your opinion \u2014 The Smoke Monster ( @ Genesis_Rising ) February 8 , 2017\nThis type of vitriolic exchange happens mostly online , on user-generated content platforms where people converge to shoot the shit . Twitter , Facebook , and Reddit are prime locations , and to a lesser extent , comment sections on news sites .\nWe are primed for stinging off-the-cuff retorts : we favorite them , repost them . George Saunders realized his own inclinations while traveling the country talking to people on the campaign trail last year . In a 2016 article for The New Yorker , Saunders describes how he researched a critique of President Barack Obama that had been levied by a Trump supporter , eager to counter with a witty rejoinder of his own , and found a more convoluted answer than he \u2019 d expected . \u201c There sat reality : huge , ambiguous , too complicated to be usefully assessed by our prevailing mutual ambition \u2014 to fight and win , via delivery of the partisan zinger . \u201d\nGet \u2588\u2588\u2588 in your inbox Subscribe Nice email address !\nThe most rewarding zingers are delivered in front of an audience , preferably a sympathetic one . And so we 've entered an era of grandstanding : long rants to friends about how you lectured some Trump supporter into submission ; fiery status updates demanding that all Bernie Bros or # imwithher hashtaggers unfriend you immediately because of X , Y , and Z ; making sure everyone sees the tweet where you pwned that Nazi . But while it is gratifying to rack up likes and retweets , this instinct is leading us into oblivion . Soon , half the country will be completely incapable of talking to the other half .\n\u201c We listen very differently to people who we recognize as kind and share some core values with . \u201d\nInsults make conversation impossible , according to Matt Motyl , PhD and professor of psychology at the University of Illinois in Chicago . \u201c The immediate reaction whenever we \u2019 re insulted is we become defensive , we want to prove that other person wrong , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Or maybe we insult them back . But it \u2019 s never : \u2018 Really , why do you think that ? \u2019 That \u2019 s never how people react to these types of very extreme insults that we launch . We respond by saying \u2018 Nuh-unh , you \u2019 re wrong , \u2019 or \u2018 Screw you ! \u2019 and then we disengage , we just stop the conversation there . \u201d\nFurthermore , once we do find ourselves in unavoidable contact with people who are not anonymous enough to dismiss with an insult , the instinct is to shut down . Thanksgiving guides published in the aftermath of the election warned against discussing politics at the dinner table , and etiquette guides have long been against the idea . \u201c [ I ] t would have to be a very rare occasion for you to find out what my political party was or who I 'm voting for in this upcoming election , \u201d boasted an Elite Daily writer in a 2012 article titled \u201c The Things You Should Never Talk About \u201d .\nThe idea that politeness and honest conversation are mutually exclusive is no doubt influenced by the form such exchanges often take : hostile , confrontational , lacking in details , facts , and nuance . But politeness is not equal to silence \u2014 or at least we shouldn \u2019 t allow it to be \u2014 which means the task at hand is figuring out how to talk to a person with differing views without falling back on political slurs .\n\u201c Confirmation bias makes it hard for people in conflict to hear positive comments or opportunities and they tend to focus on the points of conflict , \u201d said Joan Blades , co-founder of the nonprofit civil discourse organization Living Room Conversations . \u201c We listen very differently to people who we recognize as kind and share some core values with . \u201d\nTo be clear , there is a difference between challenging what someone values and challenging their entire humanity .
