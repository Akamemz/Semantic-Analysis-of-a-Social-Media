    "content": "Ever since former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney clinched the 2012 Republican presidential nomination last May , President Obama and his surrogates have waged a divisive and dishonest re-election campaign in order to distract voters from his failed record . To that end , they have spent millions of dollars on negative campaign advertisements suggesting the presumptive Republican nominee is , among other things , a \u201c vulture capitalist , '' a \u201c felon \u201d a \u201c pioneer in outsourcing , \u201d and -- most recently -- a coldhearted technocrat responsible for the death of a steelworker \u2019 s terminally ill wife . These outrageous charges have been discredited by independent fact-checkers , of course , but at least one spot continues to air in swing states . In any case , perhaps it \u2019 s not surprising that some conservatives worry these factually dubious attack ads could impede Governor Romney \u2019 s campaign momentum .\nAnd while these concerns are decidedly real and should not be taken lightly , I nevertheless believe Barack Obama faces four significant challenges in the days ahead :\n( 1 ) : This election is going to come down to jobs and the economy . As much as Team Obama ( and our sycophantic national media ) want to obsess about Mitt Romney \u2019 s tax returns , Paul Ryan \u2019 s \u201c draconian \u201d cuts to Medicare , or Congressman Akin \u2019 s callous comments -- the simple fact is that the national unemployment rate is still an incredible 8.3 percent . And further , it has been above 8 percent for 42 straight months . This is what Americans care about . No incumbent president since World War II , according to the Washington Post \u2019 s Chris Cillizza , has won re-election with the unemployment rate higher than 7.2 percent . This precedent would be deeply troubling to Team Obama in any event -- but it is particularly noteworthy now since the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office ( CBO ) released a study on Thursday reporting that the unemployment rate will exceed eight percent for the rest of this year . Even worse , the CBO added , if lawmakers in Washington don \u2019 t strike a bipartisan debt deal in time -- that is , before the country plummets off the so-called \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d -- the economy will slide into another recession in 2013 . The stakes -- as they say -- have never been higher . The question , then , is who is the best candidate to lead America during these difficult times ? One alternative is a president whose latest ( unanimously defeated ) budget proposal literally never balanced and theoretically added more than $ 11 trillion to the federal debt over ten years . The other is a successful former Republican Governor from a Blue State who balanced his state \u2019 s budget four years in a row without raising taxes .\nMitt Romney \u2019 s cash advantage over President Obama grew to more than $ 60 million last month , according to reports filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission . The joint fund-raising committee for Romney , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , claimed cash on hand totaling $ 185.9 million at the end of July , compared to $ 123.7 million for Obama \u2019 s joint committee . The candidates \u2019 joint fund-raising committees include their own campaigns , their parties \u2019 national committees and other affiliated committees .\nThis is a remarkable achievement . Why ? Incredibly , last March the president enjoyed a ten-to-one cash on hand advantage over his Republican challenger . Since that time , however , Team Obama profligately funneled millions of dollars into negative advertisements which , according to numerous surveys , have demonstrably failed to make a meaningful impact . ( The latest Fox News survey shows Mitt Romney now leading by one percentage point ) . It \u2019 s also worth mentioning that stringent federal election laws prevent Mitt Romney from spending general election contributions until after the Republican National Convention . In other words , expect to see an ad blitz over the next several months , especially in crucial swing states , explicitly reminding voters that the president raided $ 700 billion from Medicare to pay for an expensive and unpopular new entitlement , loosened work requirements for welfare recipients , and signed into law an $ 825 billion \u201c stimulus \u201d package that failed on its own terms .\n( 3 ) : Republicans are much more enthusiastic than Democrats about voting in November , according to at least one national survey . As Guy reported last month , voter enthusiasm among Republicans outpaces that of Democrats for the first time since 2004 .\nAs the graph shows , Democratic enthusiasm has dropped precipitously -- 22 percentage points in four years -- while at the same time Republican enthusiasm has risen 16 full percentage points . The math speaks for itself . ( Who would have thought , by the way , that The One would watch helplessly as his base abandoned him en masse less than four years after his historic rise to prominence ? ) Now , of course , this doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean Democrats will cross party lines and endorse his opponent . I doubt that many will . But it does suggest , however , that a plurality of Democrats -- many of whom are disenchanted with the president \u2019 s economic policies -- will elect to stay home on Election Day . Put simply , Republicans can expect a higher voter turnout in 2012 than in any other recent presidential election ; and Democrats are panicking for good reason .\n( 4 ) : This campaign will be about ideas -- not personalities -- as long as Republicans don \u2019 t lose control of the narrative . This is precisely why I believe Mitt Romney chose Congressman Paul Ryan ( R-WI ) as his running mate in the first place . Unlike Democrats , Republicans have solutions to the nation \u2019 s most pressing problems . For example , Medicare \u2019 s own actuaries estimate the program will be insolvent within twelve years . And yet , President Obama and his cabinet -- after nearly four years in office -- have failed to do anything whatsoever to avoid that outcome . Sure , one can argue that the Paul Ryan plan \u201c ends Medicare as we know it \u201d -- but so does doing nothing . Failing to act now -- while there \u2019 s still time -- will only trigger real \u201c draconian \u201d spending cuts later .\nWe need leaders who aren \u2019 t afraid to tackle the tough issues . And while Romney/Ryan has made great strides in laying out a clear vision for the country , I am absolutely convinced the current occupant of the White House has not .\nThere \u2019 s nothing novel about the individual points above . But taken collectively -- that is to say , if voters recognize the president \u2019 s economic policies have prolonged the recession , and if Mitt Romney out-raises Barack Obama financially , and if a plurality of Democrats stay home on Election Day , and finally , if the candidates discuss real issues on the campaign trail -- I think Governor Romney will triumph in November . On the other hand , to borrow a phrase from Alexander Hamilton -- one of the principal authors of The Federalist Papers -- \u201c this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected . \u201d\nNo one disputes President Obama \u2019 s charisma , personal charm and rhetorical skill . And some Democrats will vote for him no matter how much his policies have negatively impacted their lives .
