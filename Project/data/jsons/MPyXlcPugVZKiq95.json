Dissenting views were suppressed . The media flamed fears and the world panicked .\nThat is the story of what may eventually be known as one of the biggest medical and economic blunders of all time . The collective failure of every Western nation , except one , to question groupthink will surely be studied by economists , doctors , and psychologists for decades to come .\nTo put things in perspective , the virus is now known to have an infection fatality rate for most people under 65 that is no more dangerous than driving 13 to 101 miles per day . Even by conservative estimates , the odds of COVID-19 death are roughly in line with existing baseline odds of dying in any given year .\nYet we put billions of young healthy people under house arrest , stopped cancer screenings , and sunk ourselves into the worst level of unemployment since the Great Depression . This from a virus that bears a survival rate of 99.99 % if you are a healthy individual under 50 years old ( 1 , 2 ) .\nNew York City reached over a 25 % infection rate and yet 99.98 % of all people in the city under 45 survived , making it comparable to death rates by normal accidents .\nBut of course the whole linchpin of the lockdown argument is that it would have been even worse without such a step . Sweden never closed down borders , primary schools , restaurants , or businesses , and never mandated masks , yet 99.998 % of all their people under 60 have survived and their hospitals were never overburdened .\nWhy did we lock down the majority of the population who were never at significant risk ? What will be the collateral damage ? That is what this series will explore .\nIn early February the World Health Organization said that travel bans were not necessary . On Feb. 17 , just a month before the first U.S. lockdown , Dr. Anthony Fauci , the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that this new strain of coronavirus possessed \u201c just minuscule \u201d danger to the United States . In early March the U.S. surgeon general said that \u201c masks are NOT effective in preventing [ the ] general public from catching coronavirus. \u201d As late as March 9 , the day Italy started its lockdown , Dr. Fauci did not encourage cancellation of \u201c large gatherings in a place [ even if ] you have community spread , \u201d calling it \u201c a judgment call. \u201d NBA games were still being played .\nSo how did we go from such a measured tone to locking up 97 % of Americans in their homes seemingly overnight ?\nChina concealed the extent of the viral outbreak , which , if you believed its data , led many scientists to believe that 2 % to 5 % of all infected patients would die . This turned out to be off by a factor of 10 , but academic epidemiologists have a history of wildly-off-the-mark doomsday predictions .\nThe March 16 report by Imperial College epidemiologist Neil Ferguson is credited ( or blamed ) with causing the U.K. to lock down and contributing to the domino effect of global lockdowns . The model has since come under intense criticism for being \u201c totally unreliable and a buggy mess . \u201d\nThis is the same Neil Ferguson who in 2005 predicted 200 million could die from the bird flu . Total deaths over the last 15 years turned out to be 455 . This is the same Neil Ferguson who in 2009 predicted that 65,000 people could die in the U.K. from the swine flu . The final number ended up around 392 . Now , in 2020 , he predicted that 500,000 British would die from coronavirus .\nHis deeply flawed model led the United States to fear over 2 million deaths and was used to justify locking down nearly the entire nation . Dr. Ferguson is a character of Shakespearean drama and tragedy . His March 17 presentation to British elites on the dire need to take action ironically may have infected Boris Johnson and other top British officials , as Mr. Ferguson himself tested positive for COVID-19 two days later .

If you are a hammer everything looks like a nail . I blame government leaders for failing to surround themselves with diverse viewpoints and to think critically for themselves .\nIt would be highly embarrassing to force citizens to quarantine themselves only to later admit it was all a colossal blunder , so it is easier for politicians and modelers to claim the lower death rates were based on the lockdowns themselves . It was a success !\nBut several inconvenient thorns keep bursting that narrative -- and none larger than Sweden , the only Western country not to lock down its citizens . Sweden never closed borders , restaurants , businesses , or primary schools .

The model predicted up to 2,800 daily deaths within 11 days and a final death total as high as 75,000 if Sweden didn \u2019 t enact strict social distancing measures .\nThese were not complicated long-term projections ; they were predicting what would happen in the next two weeks based on months of data . Yet the daily death peak was 75 % lower than the baseline prediction and 96 % lower than the worst-case prediction .\nNot to be outdone , Uppsala University ( the oldest university in Sweden ) also presented a model that could have caused the Swedes to abandon course and lock down as the U.K. did .
