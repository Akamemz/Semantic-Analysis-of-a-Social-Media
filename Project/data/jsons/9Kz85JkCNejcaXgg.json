But he believes legislation similar to the Clean Water Act of 1972 , which set national water quality standards , is necessary to prevent the effects of environmental racism .\n`` Environmental justice , for better or worse , is kind of a buzzword in popular culture and we can construe it in different ways , '' he added . `` Until we tighten up what we mean in ensuring environmental justice and preventing the impact of structural racism on marginalized communities in terms of what infrastructure we build and where , justice wo n't be for all .
