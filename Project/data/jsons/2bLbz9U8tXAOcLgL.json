    "content": "Other items have made me hold off on The Atlantic \u2019 s hiring ( and now firing ) of conservative Kevin D. Williamson , which set off a 8.0 Richter scale triggering from progressive circles . You \u2019 d think that a neo-Nazi was added to the payroll of the magazine . Why ? Well , because Mr. Williamson has opinions , conservative ones\u2014and he articulates them eloquently on the pages of his columns . He said this about women who had abortions ( See Update ) , but the Left , overall , is playing the Williamson said this , that , and the other game , which is what happens when you get into the weeds with them . It \u2019 s your typical liberal social media mob . Well , alas , they \u2019 ve succeeded . The pressure was just too much ; the magazine fired Williamson today ( via The Wrap ) :\n\u201c Kevin is a gifted writer , and he has been nothing but professional in all of our interactions . But I have come to the conclusion that The Atlantic is not the best fit for his talents , and so we are parting ways , \u201d said editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in an email to staff on Thursday . [ \u2026 ] Late yesterday afternoon , information came to our attention that has caused us to reconsider this relationship . Specifically , the subject of one of Kevin \u2019 s most controversial tweets was also a centerpiece of a podcast discussion in which Kevin explained his views on the subject of the death penalty and abortion , \u201d wrote Goldberg . \u201c The language he used in this podcast\u2013and in my conversations with him in recent days\u2013made it clear that the original tweet did , in fact , represent his carefully considered views , \u201d he added . While Goldberg himself once trumpeted Williamson \u2019 s hire from the National Review , the writer immediately drew outrage \u2014 particularly over a tweet in which he argued that women who had had an abortion should face the death penalty . Williamson defenders \u2014 and Goldberg himself \u2014 had argued that his career should not be judged on an errant tweet .\nI didn \u2019 t expect I \u2019 d see the @ nytimes stand stronger for diversity of thought than @ TheAtlantic , but there you have it . The Times \u2019 editors are more willing than @ JeffreyGoldberg to stand up to bullies . \u2014 Erick Erickson ( @ EWErickson ) April 5 , 2018\nReport : @ TheAtlantic has already fired Kevin Williamson . This strikes me as a terrible , respect-losing move on the editor 's part . \u2014 Robby Soave ( @ robbysoave ) April 5 , 2018\nIn other news , Jeffrey Goldberg reached an amicable agreement with liberal Atlantic staffers to give them his lunch money . \u2014 Jim Geraghty ( @ jimgeraghty ) April 5 , 2018\nI know Kevin will be fine . But I hope this is a long-term stain on @ jeffreygoldberg and @ TheAtlantic . What a disgrace . \u2014 Rachael Larimore ( @ RachaelBL ) April 5 , 2018\nKevin Williamson : hired for his talent , fired for his views . This is chilling . \u2014 Noah Rothman ( @ NoahCRothman ) April 5 , 2018\nSo , Williamson was just too deplorable to keep around . That \u2019 s troubling . So what if he has controversial views ? Isn \u2019 t that the point of The Atlantic , which is to have a clash of ideas ? Something that Williamson \u2019 s colleague David French mentioned when the mobs began to form , the pitchforks grabbed , and the torches raised :\nThe proper way to evaluate a writer is through a body of work . The proper response to essays , pieces , tweets , and paragraphs you don \u2019 t like is to push back . I \u2019 ve strongly criticized those very words from Coates . I \u2019 ve criticized many of his ideas , and when he \u2019 s made me think ( and he often does ) , I \u2019 ve noted that as well . That \u2019 s what a marketplace of ideas is all about . \u201c Your ideas are wrong \u201d is a long , long way from \u201c you shouldn \u2019 t work here. \u201d And that brings us to the heart of the problem . Writers like Weissmann and Jones would no doubt say that they don \u2019 t want to silence Williamson , they just don \u2019 t think he belongs at The Atlantic . It \u2019 s as if they see The Atlantic or the Times or the Post as being on \u201c their \u201d team \u2014 and it seems as if many staffers on those publications agree . You see it in the sneering response I saw yesterday on Twitter . \u201c How many liberals has National Review hired ? \u201d We \u2019 ve likely hired roughly as many liberals as Mother Jones or The Nation has hired conservatives . After all , we \u2019 re an explicitly and intentionally conservative journal . Our very purpose centers around the debate , discussion , and exploration of conservative ideas . If you \u2019 re equating National Review and The Atlantic , then you \u2019 re giving the game away . If strongly left-leaning but not specifically ideologically-purposed entities such as the Times , the Post , or The Atlantic do as their critics seem to wish and cleanse their pages of conservative voices their critics deem unacceptable , then the loss to American intellectual life will be immense . Writers who wish to enjoy intellectual freedom will soon find that they \u2019 re only truly \u201c free \u201d when working with people of like mind \u2014 a condition that contributes immeasurably to cocooning , polarization , and intellectual stagnation . [ \u2026 ] Decide now , progressives , do you want any serious intellectual media space where conservative and progressive ideas clash ? If you do , then you just might have to endure life alongside immense talents like my friend Kevin Williamson .\nFrench also added that the addition of Megan McArdle to The Washington Post and Bari Weiss and Bret Stephens to The New York Times caused some heartburn on the Left as well , though there are notable differences . One is that all three are still employed at their respective publications . Second , they \u2019 re not really conservative . Stephens has called for the repeal of the Second Amendment , Weiss is described as liberal on some issues , more right leaning on others ( like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ) , and McArdle is more of a libertarian . Yet , he mentions something else that \u2019 s eye opening . One of The Atlantic \u2019 s writers , Ta-Nehisi Coates , is the antithesis of Williamson . Unapologetically liberal in his views , Coates said that Williamson is one of his favorite writers . He said this to National Review \u2019 s Jamie Weinstein on his podcast ( via The Federalist ) :\n\u201c He can write his a\u2013 off ! I don \u2019 t agree with sh-t he says , but \u2013if you can write , I will always look at what you \u2019 re doing , because at the very least I can study some sh-t and figure out , maybe there \u2019 s something for me , in this , \u201d he added . \u201c Even if I hate what you \u2019 re saying , or I think you \u2019 re dead wrong . \u201d\nThat sentiment was obviously not exhibited by the magazine \u2019 s front office , which sent Williamson packing after just one column . And what \u2019 s more is that Coates also has very controversial opinions as well , like when he said 9/11 responders weren \u2019 t human .\nThis is an @ TheAtlantic * approved * writer talking about 9/11 first responders who died while trying to save innocent victims . But Kevin Williamson got fired . pic.twitter.com/xAwuNvWi2z \u2014 Larry O'Connor ( @ LarryOConnor ) April 5 , 2018\nNo one raises an eyebrow when a columnist defends the eugenic extermination of unborn children with Down syndrome . But a pro-life columnist is fired for expressing his views in a controversial way . Unbelievable . \u2014 Alexandra DeSanctis ( @ xan_desanctis ) April 5 , 2018\n`` We remain committed to grappling with complex moral issues in our journalism ... as long as you grapple with them exactly the way we want you to . '' https : //t.co/zQu2oGvIVW \u2014 Alexandra DeSanctis ( @ xan_desanctis ) April 5 , 2018\nAlexandra DeSanctis also noted that while Williamson \u2019 s death penalty initiative for women who have abortions is extreme , isn \u2019 t it the same for those who think it \u2019 s perfectly fine to kill babies because they have Down Syndrome ? The Daily Wire \u2019 s Ben Shapiro noted two things with Williamson \u2019 s firing ; this is how we got Trump and how the this leads to total nutjobs becoming mainstreamed since it reinforces conservatives \u2019 need to band together for defense\u2014no matter who is in the ranks :\nKevin Williamson \u2019 s firing is how you got Trump , as well as the alt-right \u2019 s near-mainstreaming . Here \u2019 s why . ( /1 ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nThe Left continues to radically narrow the Overton Window - the spectrum of acceptable discourse . ( 2/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nThey separate discourse into two categories : the acceptable and the unacceptable . Then they shrink the acceptable down to the opinions located between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . ( 3/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nThis necessarily places Kevin Williamson and @ bariweiss and @ SamHarrisOrg and me and everyone else the Left finds unpalatable into the \u201c excluded \u201d category . ( 4/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nBut the unacceptable category is already populated by those who are actually unacceptable : alt-right trolls , for example . ( 5/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nThis means that the population of opinion in the unacceptable category - let \u2019 s call them Deplorables , since the Left does - come to be a majority by way of exclusion . ( 6/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nUnless , that is , virtuous people who have been excluded by the Left draw distinctions among themselves . Which they should , of course - Kevin and @ bariweiss and I and @ SamHarrisOrg all get lumped in as Nazis by the Left , but we all fight the actual alt-right Nazis . ( 7/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nUnless , that is , virtuous people who have been excluded by the Left draw distinctions among themselves . Which they should , of course - Kevin and @ bariweiss and I and @ SamHarrisOrg all get lumped in as Nazis by the Left , but we all fight the actual alt-right Nazis . ( 7/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nBut counting on the virtue of people you \u2019 ve just deemed unacceptable not to band together against you is both stupid and unrealistic over time . ( 8/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nWhich means the Left is doing something unethical here , and deeply dishonest - and something that is likely to foster polarization that results in the mainstreaming of truly gross opinions . ( 9/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nThis is how you get a reactionary movement willing to countenance alt-right evil : you tell people they \u2019 re part of the alt-right when they \u2019 re not , and treat them as such no matter how much of a lie that is . ( 10/ ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nWhat just happened to Kevin Williamson leads conservatives to side with anyone the Left casts out , good or bad , merely as a form of protection . That shouldn \u2019 t happen . But it does . And the Left causes it with this bulls * * * . ( END ) \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) April 5 , 2018\nSo , the Left has scalped Mr. Williamson , though I \u2019 m sure he \u2019 ll land on his feet somewhere soon . In this End of Discussion battle , the Left won\u2014but tomorrow is a new day .\nUPDATE : Allen Ginzburg offered some clarification on the Williamson abortion controversy .\nSince people are still lying about what Kevin Williamson said . Here were tweets from the controversial thread in 2014 where he makes clear the point he was making & who it would apply to . pic.twitter.com/6pQQAxxUVd \u2014 ( ( ( AG ) ) ) ( @ AG_Conservative ) April 5 , 2018\nTo translate : Kevin believes abortion is murder . He believes the law should be changed to treat it like other types of murder . He does not believe in punishing people who follow the law now .\nI disagree with this , but it 's not an outrageous view worthy of denying a platform . \u2014 ( ( ( AG ) ) ) ( @ AG_Conservative ) April 5 , 2018",
