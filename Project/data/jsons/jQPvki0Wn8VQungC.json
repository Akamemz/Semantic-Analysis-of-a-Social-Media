But what do these outlets mean for journalism in American communities ?\nUsing previous research and news reports as a guide , we \u2019 ve mapped the locations of more than 400 partisan media outlets \u2014 often funded and operated by government officials , political candidates , PACs , and political party operatives \u2014 and found , somewhat unsurprisingly , that these outlets are emerging most often in swing states , raising a concern about the ability of such organizations to fill community information needs while prioritizing the electoral value of an audience .\nWe found that while the ( few ) left-leaning sites prioritize statewide reporting , right-leaning sites are more focused on local reporting , suggesting different strategies for engaging with targeted audiences and indicating the potential for these sites to exacerbate polarization in local communities .\nHere \u2019 s our map of how these sources are distributed across the U.S. , along with their partisan orientation :\nWe used research by Priyanjana Bengani at Columbia University \u2019 s Tow Center for Digital Journalism as a starting point . Bengani identified 450 sites that are part of 12 state networks operated by five corporate entities . To do so , she used shared registrant information from the WHOIS database of registered domains , shared IP addresses , and shared analytics identifiers to identify the scope and boundaries of networks . This kind of detailed detective work was necessary because these sites are often opaque about their ownership and/or financial backing .\nBengani identified five organizations operating these networks , all with conservative political ties . Conservative businessman Brian Timpone founded the Record network in 2004 . As disclosed on Record publications , the network is owned by the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform , an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . Timpone also runs Locality Labs/LocalLabs , which operates only in Florida . Franklin Archer , whose CEO is Timpone \u2019 s brother Michael , operates a local news network with over 100 sites and a metro business network with 51 sites . Dan Proft , who ran the conservative super PAC Liberty Principles , created the Local Government Information Services ( LGIS ) network in Illinois in 2016 .
