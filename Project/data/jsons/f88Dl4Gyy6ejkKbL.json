Fox News even kicked off its morning election coverage with Romney 's speech in Orlando , Florida -- airing it for the entire 26 minutes .\nBy contrast , Fox covered only the first Obama speech in Madison , Wisconsin on Monday -- and went back to regular coverage after just eight minutes .

CNN gave Romney speeches 66 minutes of total airtime while Obama speeches received 39 minutes of airtime .\nIn the five days leading up to Election Day , Fox has given Romney speeches unprecedented coverage -- a near four and a half total hours .
