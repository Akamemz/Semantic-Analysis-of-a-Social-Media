The cover \u2019 s artist , Mark Ulriksen , says the inspiration for it came after he asked himself : \u201c what would King be doing if her were around today ? \u201d\nHe goes on to say : \u201c How would you feel if you had to show up at work every day and salute a country that treats black people like second-class citizens ? I \u2019 m glad that Colin Kaepernick and Michael Bennett are making it political . I \u2019 m sure that if King were around today , he \u2019 d be disappointed at the slow pace of progress ... \u201d\nIn his famous book \u201c From Strength to Love , \u201d Dr. King wrote \u201c only through an inner spiritual transformation do we gain the strength to fight vigorously the evils of the world in a humble and loving spirit . \u201d\nOn a day designed for public service and national unity , some in the media insist on making it about politics .\nThis day shouldn \u2019 t be about whether or not Dr. King would support the national anthem protests . Frankly , no one will ever know . Perhaps , we should reflect on what we do know about Dr. King : his teachings on love , his commitment to ministering the Gospel , his dream of equality for all people .\nReporters at the White House on Thursday didn \u2019 t care to treat MLK Day with reverence either . I found it telling that even after Dr. King \u2019 s nephew gave a powerful speech about his uncle \u2019 s legacy , not a single reporter made much of what he said .
