    "content": "According to a 414-page report released by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , there is `` no evidence '' that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted any of his accusers , but there is evidence that some of Kavanaugh 's accusers may have been involved in a criminal conspiracy to mislead the committee .\nIn a lengthy series of tweets , the Judiciary Committee announced the report and explained some of the work that went into its compilation .\nThe report took special aim at Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick , who issued a sworn statement just days before a planned Judiciary Committee vote that accused Kavanaugh of having participated in numerous parties where he drugged women in order to gang rape them . Swetnick was represented by Michael Avenatti , who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels , who has accused President Trump of having an affair with her several years ago . Avenatti is widely expected to run for president as a Democrat in 2020 .\nSwetnick 's original statement was initially revealed in a tweet from Avenatti . According to the committee report , judiciary committee staffers contacted Avenatti `` ten minutes '' after the tweet was posted . According to the report , `` Although Avenatti alluded to having evidence to support his client \u2019 s claims , he refused to produce anything for several days , notwithstanding the Committee \u2019 s repeated requests . Ultimately , Avenatti provided the Committee with only a sworn declaration from Swetnick . He posted a redacted declaration from an alleged supporting witness on his Twitter account on October 2 and 3 , but he refused to identify the author . ''\nThe report also claims that committee investigators attempted to schedule an interview with Swetnick , but that Avenatti refused the request . The report notes , however , that Swetnick granted an interview to MSNBC , where she `` made several statements that differed from her declaration . ''\nFor example , although she maintained that she saw Justice Kavanaugh drink heavily and act aggressively toward women , she did not say that she actually saw him spike the punch or wait in a line to take part in gang rapes at the parties , as she asserted to the Committee via her declaration . Despite the fact her signed statement claimed it was based \u201c on personal information , \u201d when challenged by CNN about the inconsistencies , Avenatti later conceded : \u201c One of her friends informed her of what she just put in the declaration or what was attested to in the declaration . \u201d\nThe report claims that committee staffers conducted numerous interviews with individuals who knew either Kavanaugh or Swetnick at the time of the allegations , and none of them `` witnessed any behavior that even approached the conduct described in Swetnick \u2019 s declaration . ''\nAccording to the report , committee staffers conducted additional investigation into Swetnick 's background , and found that she had a `` lengthy history of litigation , '' including litigation in which she was represented by the same firm that represented Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford , that she was significantly in debt , that she was accused by a previous employer of having engaged in `` unwelcome sexual innuendo and appropriate conduct at work . ''\nThe Committee found no verifiable evidence to support Swetnick \u2019 s allegations . Indeed , the evidence appears to support the position that Julie Swetnick and Mr. Avenatti criminally conspired to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee \u2019 s investigation . Accordingly , the Committee referred both to the Department of Justice and FBI for investigation and potential violations of 18 U.S.C . \u00a7 371 , \u00a7 1001 , and \u00a7 1505 on October 25 , 2018 . In addition , on October 26 , 2018 , the Committee made a second criminal referral against Michael Avenatti to the Justice Department and FBI for investigation of potential violations of 18 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 1001 ( knowingly providing materially false statements ) and 1505 ( obstruction of a congressional investigation ) , based upon the NBC story that evidenced that Mr. Avenatti may have fabricated allegations by a second declarant .\nThe report also explained the committee 's decision to refer a woman named Judy Munro-Leighton to the FBI for possible investigation .\nAfter the Committee released the transcript of the interview with Justice Kavanaugh , a woman named Judy Munro-Leighton sent an email to the Senate Judiciary Committee claiming to be Jane Doe . She included a version of the letter \u2019 s text and said she felt compelled to contact the Committee because she \u201c refuse [ d ] to allow Donald J. Trump to use me or my story as an ugly chant at one of his Republican rallies. \u201d The Committee quickly concluded that Munro-Leighton was unlikely to be the author .
