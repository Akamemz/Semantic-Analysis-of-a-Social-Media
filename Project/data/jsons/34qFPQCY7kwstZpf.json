    "content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is turning up the heat on Paul Manafort and Rick Gates even higher .\nOn Thursday , a Virginia grand jury indicted Manafort and Gates on a combined 32 counts , alleging a dizzying array of tax , financial , and bank fraud crimes , some of which took place as recently as last year . Mueller alleges that Manafort laundered more than $ 30 million with Gates \u2019 s help .\nThese new charges will be considered in a separate venue from the combined 12 counts of conspiracy , money laundering , financial , and false statements charges Mueller filed against the two men through a Washington , DC , grand jury last October . A spokesperson for the special counsel \u2019 s office confirmed to me Thursday evening that the DC case will still proceed as well , saying , \u201c Both cases will move forward . \u201d\nNow , like the first set of charges against the pair , the new charges don \u2019 t have anything to do with the topic of Russian interference with the 2016 campaign , which is Mueller \u2019 s central concern .\nBut the special counsel \u2019 s goal is likely to increase the pressure on one or both of them to flip and cooperate with the Russian interference probe , because the indictment comes after weeks of reported discussions between Gates and Mueller \u2019 s team about a possible plea deal \u2014 discussions that , it seems , have not yet ended in an agreement , despite reports one was imminent . Even early Thursday evening , there were conflicting reports about just what was going on with Gates or which lawyer even represents him at this point , and concrete answers on that front remain elusive .\nThe bigger picture from these new charges , though , is that Manafort and Gates are now in even more trouble and are contemplating a far longer potential sentence should they be convicted . And that could drive one or both of them to flip , should they have information incriminating President Trump or his team that Mueller would want .\nWhat Mueller \u2019 s new indictment against Manafort and Gates alleges : the big picture\nThe new charges refer to a \u201c scheme \u201d from Manafort and Gates that had two separate parts . Mueller alleges :\nBetween about 2006 and 2015 \u2014 the \u201c first part of the scheme , \u201d Mueller writes \u2014 Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars from their work for Ukrainian politicians and Ukraine \u2019 s government and tried to hide it from US authorities . They did so by saying the money came from \u201c loans \u201d from offshore corporate entities they controlled , and Manafort used his offshore accounts to buy real estate .\nBut between about 2015 and at least January 2017 , \u201c the Ukraine income dwindled \u201d because of the downfall of the country \u2019 s president . So during that period , which Mueller calls \u201c the second part of the scheme , \u201d Manafort and Gates \u201c fraudulently secured more than twenty million dollars in loans , \u201d the indictment alleges . They used the real estate Manafort had purchased with his offshore funds as collateral and lied about their company \u2019 s income and their existing debt to lenders .\nOverall , the indictment alleges that Manafort , with Gates \u2019 s \u201c assistance , \u201d laundered $ 30 million and concealed it from the US government , while Gates himself obtained more than $ 3 million , which he also concealed .\nThe basics of what Mueller dubs the \u201c first part of the scheme \u201d were mostly known already from last fall \u2019 s indictment . What \u2019 s added here are several charges specifically related to taxes . These may be coming later because , per an earlier report from the Daily Beast \u2019 s Betsy Woodruff , there is a \u201c time-consuming \u201d process for getting those charges approved by the Justice Department \u2019 s Tax Division .\nThe new charges include crimes allegedly committed much more recently\nHowever , the allegations said to be the \u201c second part of the scheme \u201d are new . Mueller alleges that in the year before and even during the presidential campaign , Manafort used misrepresentations , false statements , and doctored documents to repeatedly get multimillion-dollar loans from financial institutions .\nThat in October 2016 , Manafort and Gates altered a document to claim their company would make $ 3.5 million , when it was in fact set to lose $ 600,000 , and that they sent that doctored document to a lender\nThat in March 2016 , Manafort and Gates gave a document to a different lender overstating their income by more than $ 2 million \u2014 and worked with a \u201c conspirator \u201d working at the lending company to get an approval\nThat , also in March 2016 , Manafort and Gates butted heads with their bookkeeper , who refused to allow them to claim $ 2.4 million in income they hadn \u2019 t received \u2014 leading Gates to falsify the document himself and submit it to yet another lender\nThat in 2016 , Manafort falsely claimed a condo he was using as a rental property as a second home , and wrote in an email that he was doing so \u201c in order to have the maximum benefit , \u201d and tried to falsely convince a bank appraiser that his son-in-law lived there\nAnd that Manafort falsely told a lender that $ 300,000 he had in credit card debt had in fact been incurred because he \u201c lent his credit card to a friend \u201d who would soon pay him back \u2014 that friend being Gates\nOverall , the indictment paints a picture of two men desperate for millions in loans \u2014 apparently to prevent Manafort \u2019 s financial house of cards from collapsing once the Ukraine money stopped coming in \u2014 and unscrupulous about how they \u2019 d get them .\nAs to why the new charges were filed in Virginia \u2014 rather than in DC along with the first set of charges \u2014 Mueller writes that he concluded that , based on the evidence he has , \u201c venue for these charges does not exist in the District of Columbia \u201d ( apparently because neither man actually lived in the city ) .
