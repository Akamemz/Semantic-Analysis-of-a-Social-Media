We 'll leave aside the psychoanalysis of why someone might be so eager to present himself as heir to one of the greatest villains in American history , but Trump has n't been subtle about his belief that he can replicate Nixon 's 1968 electoral victory by triggering the same animus against civil rights activists and leftist protesters that Nixon successfully exploited back then , but with even less subtlety . ( And Nixon was n't exactly subtle . ) Trump even routinely echoes the `` law and order '' language of the Nixon campaign , even while gleefully flaunting his own criminality and corruption , lest there be any doubt that `` law and order '' is simply coded language for racism and reactionary impulses .\nThe problem is that Trump 's efforts to demonize anti-racist protesters keep backfiring .\nFirst , Trump ordered the tear-gassing of a crowd of peaceful protesters in front of the White House , in an effort to generate images of chaos and violence that he could then blame on them . Instead , the action garnered even more sympathy for the protesters , who were seen as the victims of Trump 's violent and censorious urges . Besides , it made him look like a cowardly bully \u2014 garnering him the immortal nickname `` Bunker Boy '' \u2014 a guy who was so afraid of being heckled that he had people gassed to avoid it .\nTrump tried again , scheduling a campaign rally on Juneteenth , the day that many Black Americans celebrate Emancipation , and in Tulsa , Oklahoma , mere blocks away from the location of one of the worst racially motivated mass murders in American history . The date and location were deliberate provocations , and Trump made plain his longings for scenes of violence outside the rally , even going so far as to encourage the Tulsa police to start cracking skulls . Instead , what he got was a pitiful turnout from his own supporters \u2014 who barely filled a third of the arena \u2014 and a peaceful protest outside that got virtually no media attention .\nBut Donald Trump has never been one to let the empirical evidence of the real world shake his convictions , and so it is with his belief that his path to re-election involves widespread video clips of police gassing , beating or otherwise doing violence to the people who are gathered in the streets to demand an end to police brutality and a reckoning with our nation 's history of racism . So this week , he 's taking his third swing for the imaginary fences .\nOn Wednesday , the White House ordered the U.S . Marshals Service to put resources into guarding any national monuments that might be targeted by protesters for vandalism , because the monument appears to celebrates white supremacy or is a tribute to an apparent white supremacist . The order reportedly came from Attorney General Bill Barr , in response to the number of incidents nationwide where protesters have spray-painted or attempted to tear down such monuments .\nMost of the statues that have been targeted this way were erected both to honor Confederate military leaders and to signal to Black residents of a community that their presence was not welcome . In many cases , local leaders have responded to the protests by giving into their demands and having city services take down such statues safely , rather than leaving it up to the chaos of the crowds .

It 's doubtful that Trump or any of the conservatives angrily spitting out platitudes like `` those who forget history are doomed to repeat it '' would care if these statues were coming down , say , to make room for a Doubletree Inn or a parking garage .
