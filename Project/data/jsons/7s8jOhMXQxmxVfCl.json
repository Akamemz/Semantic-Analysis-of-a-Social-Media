''\nThe mayor said speaking with Officer Rafael Ramos ' two teenage sons made him think of his own children .\n`` You have two teenage , good young men , who no longer have a father because of an assassin , '' de Blasio said .\n`` I told them that I lost my own dad when I was 18 , and that as painful and difficult as it is , families come together . People find a way forward , '' he said . `` I also told them that we would be there for them .
