Boehner and force a House vote on extending the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone except individuals making $ 200,000 and more and couples making $ 250,000 .\nSuch a vote would give Republicans who want to abandon the speaker and the GOP \u201c no-higher-tax-rates \u201d position a chance to buck party leaders and cut their own deal with Democrats to avert the \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d \u2014 the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect in January .\nNo Republicans have signed or said they would sign the petition , but Democrats are optimistic they can find more than two dozen GOP lawmakers needed to send the stalled bill to the floor for a vote \u2014 especially if negotiations between the president and Mr. Boehner remain stalled .\n\u201c The discharge petition , while we do want to get it to the [ House ] floor , it can also be a catalyst to move people , \u201d said Rep. Timothy J. Walz , a Minnesota Democrat who filed the petition on behalf of his party . \u201c It sends a signal to [ House Speaker John A . ] Boehner that , if he gets a few of his members on it , it maybe frees him up for a little bit of negotiating . \u201d\nThe petition calls for House action on a bill that passed the Democrat-controlled Senate this year that would keep George W. Bush-era tax cuts in place for individuals earning up to $ 200,000 and couples making up to $ 250,000 . For those earning more \u2014 about 2 percent of taxpayers \u2014 the tax breaks would expire as scheduled in January .\nRepublicans have expressed little interest in the measure and say they want the tax breaks extended to all income levels .\nDemocrats were inspired in part to try the unconventional approach after Rep. Tom Cole , Oklahoma Republican , last month said he would be willing to let the tax cuts expire for the nation \u2019 s most wealthy as a way to help avoid the looming \u201c fiscal cliff . \u201d\nRep. Walter B. Jones , a moderate Republican from North Carolina , also said he would consider signing the petition .\nDischarge petitions require a simple majority of the House \u2019 s 435 members , or 218 votes , to advance a stalled bill toward a full floor vote . If all of the chamber \u2019 s 191 Democrats sign Mr. Walz \u2019 s petition , the support of 27 Republicans would be needed to get the bill to the House floor .\nIf the required signatures are secured this week , the earliest likely day that the bill could be brought to the floor under House rules is Dec. 24 .\nThirteen Democrats haven \u2019 t signed the petition , which was filed Tuesday . Mr. Walz said he expects most , if not all , Democrats to give their support . He noted that many who haven \u2019 t done so were out of town last week and said no Democrat has refused to sign the petition .\nGetting \u201c the 191 Democrats on it , that \u2019 s great , that \u2019 s nice , that shows unity .
