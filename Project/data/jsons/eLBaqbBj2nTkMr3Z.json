    "content": "Net neutrality still has a shot at survival , but its vital signs are weakening .\nAs of June 11 , 2018 , the FCC \u2019 s controversial repeal of the 2015 act that enshrined net neutrality into law has officially taken effect . That means net neutrality , currently , no longer exists .\nNet neutrality requires internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast to distribute internet access fairly and equally to everyone , regardless of how much they pay or where they \u2019 re located . The incendiary FCC vote in December to repeal those requirements happened despite overwhelming public support for the regulation . The FCC instead had backing from a long list of Republican lawmakers , and FCC chair Ajit Pai was clearly determined to move ahead with the repeal amid a tense hearing that was briefly evacuated due to a security threat .\nSince December , however , a groundswell of support has helped keep the conversation around net neutrality \u2014 and attempts to save it \u2014 alive . These efforts have included a successful move by the Senate to cancel the repeal using the Congressional Review Act , which lets Congress reverse \u2014 and , crucially , permanently block \u2014 any federal regulation with a simple majority vote . The Senate \u2019 s resolution , which passed 52-47 , was concurrent with a storm of activism across the internet \u2014 this time with far more urgency than last year \u2019 s milquetoast protests .\nFrom the Senate , however , the path to repeal gets considerably more complicated . The House is less likely to support the Senate \u2019 s resolution , and even if it makes it out of Congress onto President Trump \u2019 s desk , the president would most likely veto it .\nThe implications of the FCC \u2019 s repeal are vast and complicated . If congressional efforts to save net neutrality fail and the repeal is allowed to take effect , it will almost certainly fundamentally change how people access and use the internet . But there \u2019 s also still the ghost of a chance that the repeal might be overturned , not by Congress , but by the US Court of Appeals . All 22 states with a Democratic attorney general have signed onto a joint lawsuit against the FCC to revoke the rules , and this might be the best chance we have at enshrining net neutrality protection into the fabric of internet law .\nHere \u2019 s what you need to know about what \u2019 s happened with net neutrality , and what could happen next .\nIn December , the FCC voted on the Restoring Internet Freedom Order , which concerned the repeal of Title II protection for net neutrality .\nTitle II is a decades-old regulatory clause under which internet service providers ( ISPs ) have been ruled telecommunications companies and subject to the same regulations that other telecommunication companies \u2014 classified as utilities \u2014 must abide by . That basic regulatory standard is what people are referring to when they talk about net neutrality . Title II was first applied to ISPs in 2015 , after a hard-won fight by internet activists .\nPlacing ISPs under Title II was the only legal way \u2014 barring the unlikely introduction and passage of Congressional legislation instituting complicated new regulatory procedures \u2014 in which these companies could be regulated .\nThe FCC \u2019 s repeal did institute one very thin piece of ISP regulation in place of net neutrality \u2014 a version of a 2010 transparency ruling that requires ISPs to inform consumers when the ISPs are deliberately slowing their internet speed . The FCC will be passing off the enforcement of this transparency stipulation to the FTC , in a long-planned and recently formalized agreement that will allow the two commissions \u201c to work together to take targeted action against bad actors. \u201d That phrasing , however , leaves open a wide playing field for major telecom companies . In other words , now that the FCC has repealed Title II classification for ISPs , the ISPs will essentially be unregulated .\n2 ) Why does it matter if ISPs are regulated or not ?\nClassifying ISPs as utility companies under Title II meant they had to treat the internet like every other utility \u2014 that is , just like gas , water , or phone service \u2014 and that they couldn \u2019 t cut off service at will or control how much of it any one person received based on how much that person paid for it . The idea was that the internet should be a public service that everyone has a right to use , not a privilege , and that regulating ISPs like utilities would prevent them from hijacking or monopolize that access .\nThe best argument for the rollback of this Title II protection is that maybe the internet isn \u2019 t a public service \u2014 maybe it \u2019 s just another product , and in a free market system , competition over who gets to sell you that product would ensure accountability and fair treatment among providers , if only due to economic self-interest .\nBut there \u2019 s a huge problem with that argument , which is that , as far as the internet is concerned , there really isn \u2019 t a free and open market . In the United States , competition among ISPs was driven down years ago thanks to the consolidated nature of internet broadband infrastructure , which has typically been owned by major corporations , shutting out local ISP competitors .\nThat \u2019 s why many people don \u2019 t really have much choice about which company they pay for internet access \u2014 that access has been monopolized by a handful of powerful companies . In fact , nearly 50 million households have only one high-speed ISP in their area .\nThese particular utility companies , now unregulated , have free reign to behave like the corporate monopolies they are . Where net neutrality ensured the preservation of what \u2019 s been dubbed \u201c the open internet , \u201d its repeal will open the door for ISPs to create \u201c an internet for the elite . \u201d\n3 ) What will happen to the internet without net neutrality protections in place ?\nNet neutrality mandated that ISPs display all websites , at the same speed , to all sources of internet traffic . Without net neutrality , all bets are off .\nThat means ISPs will be free to control what you access on the internet , meaning they will be able to block access to specific websites and pieces of software that interact with the internet .\nThey might charge you more or less money to access specific \u201c bundles \u201d of certain websites , much as cable television providers do now \u2014 but instead of \u201c basic cable , \u201d you might be forced to pay for access to more than a \u201c basic \u201d number of websites , as this popular pro-net neutrality graphic illustrates :\nISPs will also be able to control how quickly you \u2019 re served webpages , how quickly you can download and upload things , and in what contexts you can access which websites , depending on how much money you pay them .\nThey \u2019 ll be able to charge you more to access sites you currently visit for free , cap how much data you \u2019 re allowed to use , redirect you from sites you are trying to use to sites they want you to use instead , and block you from being able to access apps , products , and information offered by their competitors or other companies they don \u2019 t like .\nThey can even block you from being able to access information on certain topics , news events , or issues they don \u2019 t want you to know about .\nFinally , they \u2019 ll be able to exert this power not just over individual consumers , but over companies , as well . This could result in the much-discussed \u201c internet fast lane \u201d \u2014 in which an ISP forces a company like Twitter or BitTorrent to pay more for faster access for readers or users like you to its websites and services . Larger , more powerful companies likely won \u2019 t be hurt by this change . Smaller companies and websites almost definitely will be .\nWe already have a good idea of how these scenarios might play out , because in the era before net neutrality existed , ISPs tried instituting all of them : via jacked-up fees , forced redirection , content-blocking , software-blocking , website-blocking , competitor-blocking and still more competitor-blocking , app-blocking and still more app-blocking , data-capping , and censorship of controversial subjects .\nIf net neutrality advocates have made it seem like there \u2019 s simply no end to the worst-case scenarios that unregulated ISPs might subject us to , it \u2019 s because they \u2019 ve learned from experience . This history of ISP exploitation is a major reason that advocates for net neutrality fought so hard for it to begin with .\nWe also know that many ISPs , notably Comcast , already have their eyes on the aforementioned \u201c fast lane , \u201d also known as \u201c paid prioritization. \u201d ( Disclaimer : Comcast is an investor in \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s parent company , \u2588\u2588\u2588 Media , through its NBC-Universal arm . )\nAnd lest you believe that the current FCC is prepared to make sure that such offenses are fully sanctioned and dealt with by the government , think again . FCC chair Pai is a vocal proponent of letting ISPs self-regulate , and seems perfectly content to ignore their contentious and often predatory history .\nNot only that , but the FCC is explicitly preventing state consumer protection laws from taking effect regarding net neutrality . That means that once the repeal is final , the rights of states to govern themselves won \u2019 t apply to protecting net neutrality . ( Though California and Washington each vowed after the vote to try to protect it anyway . )\n4 ) Who will be most affected by the repeal of net neutrality ?\nWomen , minorities , rural communities , and internet developers will feel the fullest effects of this repeal .\nThe general argument among net neutrality advocates is that without an open internet , members of society who have historically been marginalized and silenced will be in danger of being further marginalized and silenced , or marginalized and silenced once more \u2014 particularly women and minorities .\nWe \u2019 ve seen in the past that ISPs can and will censor access to controversial subjects . Without regulation , situations could arise in which underprivileged or disenfranchised individuals and groups have less access to speak up or contact others online .\nOne worst-case scenario that we haven \u2019 t yet seen in America , but which is worth considering given the current heated political climate , is that ISPs could potentially play a role in limiting or marginalizing certain communities during times of urgency \u2014 for instance , an ISP might choose to block a mobilizing hashtag like # BlackLivesMatter at the start of an organic protest .\nThis might seem like a dire prediction , but there \u2019 s precedent for it : In 2011 , the Egyptian government heavily censored certain websites during the Arab Spring . And in Turkey , under the administration of President Erdogan , the country has become notorious for censoring websites and blocking hashtags , at one point banning Twitter altogether .\nRural areas of the US \u2014 where internet access is already scarce due to a lack of ISPs operating there \u2014 will be further subjected to corporatization and monopolization of their internet infrastructure .\nMore than 10 million Americans already lack broadband access , and as the Hill notes in an overview of the potential impact of net neutrality \u2019 s repeal , \u201c Good broadband is a small town \u2019 s lifeline out of geographic isolation , its connection to business software and services , and its conduit for exporting homegrown ideas and products. \u201d Without regulatory inducements , corporate ISPs will have little incentive to develop infrastructure in such areas .\nAnother group that will be heavily impacted by net neutrality \u2019 s repeal \u2014 one that \u2019 s often overlooked but extremely crucial \u2014 is innovators and developers and people who create stuff for the internet . Tim Berners-Lee , creator of the internet as we know it , recently summed up the repeal \u2019 s potential effect on these developers :\nIf US net neutrality rules are repealed , future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package . That means no more permissionless space for innovation . ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load . In other words , they \u2019 ll be able to decide which companies succeed online , which voices are heard \u2014 and which are silenced .\nAgain , this all sounds pretty dire \u2014 but that \u2019 s because it is . The people with the most expertise , the most investment in creating a progressive internet , and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space .\nIt \u2019 s important to note , too , that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented , we can \u2019 t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact .\n5 ) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support , and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire ?\nPretty much everybody supports net neutrality \u2014 it \u2019 s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on . The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation .\nOver the last nine years , Verizon , Comcast , and AT & T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight , and especially to block or repeal net neutrality . They found a loyal friend in Pai , who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama , and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office in January . Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC , calling it a \u201c massive intrusion in the internet economy . \u201d\nSo Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality , despite the overwhelming public support for it . He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary , and has also argued , in opposition to hard evidence , that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect . With Trump \u2019 s full backing , he made undoing it a priority .\nIn fact , even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions , he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC \u2019 s website since it began the repeal process in May . That \u2019 s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites . While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments , many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions . Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand : Once the number of duplicate comments came to light , the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as \u201c opinions \u201d that came without \u201c introducing new facts . \u201d\nEssentially , even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal , and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions , the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed , because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved . FCC commissioner Rosenworcel , one of the commission \u2019 s two minority Democrats , acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal , noting `` the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public . \u201d\nAs Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it , \u201c To be clear , when the FCC says that it is \u2018 restoring internet freedom , \u2019 it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers . \u201d\nA lot . Proponents of net neutrality have been busy at all levels of government trying to undo the FCC \u2019 s ruling . In March , Washington became the first state to protect net neutrality , by enacting a law that prohibits any ISP servicing the state to block or slow traffic . A month later , Oregon followed suit with a similar law . Two even tougher bills are currently being pushed through California and New York state legislature .\nThese laws , while feisty , aren \u2019 t foolproof : The FCC \u2019 s ruling includes a dictum that states aren \u2019 t allowed to self-regulate to protect net neutrality . Therefore , unless the FCC \u2019 s ruling itself is overturned , these laws stand in danger of being overturned in court .\nThe path Congress is taking is more direct but very thorny . The Congressional Repeal Act , under which Sen. Ed Markey ( D-MA ) petitioned to force a vote to overturn the FCC ruling , means proponents of net neutrality only need a simple majority . But despite overwhelming bipartisan public support , that \u2019 s not a given .\nMarkey \u2019 s resolution to overturn the FCC ruling was a success in the Senate , where supporters needed just 51 votes ; ultimately , it passed with 52 . From there , however , the vote shifted to the House , where it now needs 218 votes to pass , meaning Democrats voting in a bloc would need to muster up 25 more votes from Republicans . That \u2019 s unlikely to happen .\nAnd even if the CRA motion to repeal the repeal actually manages to make it out of Congress onto the president \u2019 s desk , there \u2019 s every possibility that Trump , in what many perceive as an ongoing quest to destroy Obama \u2019 s legacy , will veto it .\nThat means that the best chance to reverse the FCC \u2019 s net neutrality repeal may lie in the court system .\nMere hours after the FCC vote in December , a flurry of lawsuits from tech companies , internet activists , the competitive carrier association INCOMPAS , and think tanks descended upon Washington . A multi-state appeal of the ruling was announced by the attorney general of the state of New York , Eric Schneiderman ( who recently resigned after multiple allegations of assault ) . The attorneys general of 22 other states joined the appeal by filing similar suits , which petitioned the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC \u2019 s order .\nThe collection of suits were filed as a consolidated suit in both D.C. and San Francisco , and were eventually punted to the U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C. following an appeal from the petitioners to have the location moved from San Francisco . That request might sound counterintuitive , given that San Francisco is the home of Silicon Valley \u2014 but judges serving D.C. have presided over previous cases involving net neutrality three times in the last decade , and are well-equipped to understand the complexities of the case . This is crucial given that the court could well be the determining factor in whether the repeal ultimately takes effect .\nTechnically , it already has . Some relatively minor parts of the FCC \u2019 s repeal took effect on April 23 , 2018 , including the reclassification of the internet as an information service rather than a utility . The ruling \u2019 s major consequences kicked in on June 11 , after some red tape was cleared up .\nMeanwhile , now that the Senate has sent the joint resolution to the House , the House has until the end of the legislative session ( which concludes at the end of 2018 , when a new Congress will be sworn in ) to vote on the Senate \u2019 s resolution . Should the measure fail , it \u2019 s still probable that the absence of net neutrality won \u2019 t become immediately apparent . It \u2019 s possible , for example , that the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals could order a stay of the ruling while motions against it are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated .\nIn a nutshell , we don \u2019 t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system , so we can \u2019 t know when \u2014 or if \u2014 it will take effect . And it \u2019 s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC \u2019 s decision , that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing .\nIn the meantime , the FCC regulation has already taken effect \u2014 and net neutrality activists like Fight for the Future have predicted that encroaching moves by corporate ISPs will be gradual and insidious rather than sudden and overnight . That \u2019 s partly because the court situation is still a giant mess , so rolling out significant changes while the courts are still deciding the fate of the repeal could be disastrous .\nAnd partly , it \u2019 s because corporations won \u2019 t want you to notice the difference . It \u2019 s easier to get the public to accept a gradual fee hike or change in the structure of your internet service over time than it would be to , for example , abruptly start charging you extra for access to your favorite websites . Gradual change will also give the ISPs time to ride out the public \u2019 s mistrust , perhaps by claiming that net neutrality went away and the world didn \u2019 t end .\nBut while that might be true at first , the reality is that in the long term , a net neutrality repeal makes the internet less democratic . What the final version of that repeal might look like , and when it might take effect , are both unknown at this point \u2014 with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance .\nUpdate : This piece was originally written in December 2017 . It has been updated to include subsequent events surrounding the FCC \u2019 s net neutrality repeal .",

Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the internet as we know it, recently summed up the repeal\u2019s potential effect on these developers:\n\nIf US net neutrality rules are repealed, future innovators will have to first negotiate with each ISP to get their new product onto an internet package. That means no more permissionless space for innovation. ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they\u2019ll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard \u2014 and which are silenced.\n\nAgain, this all sounds pretty dire \u2014 but that\u2019s because it is. The people with the most expertise, the most investment in creating a progressive internet, and the strongest ability to advocate for an open internet could be prevented from doing their best work because of a lack of ability to pay for access to an ISP-controlled space.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, too, that because the nature of the repeal is unprecedented, we can\u2019t necessarily predict every group and demographic that could potentially feel its impact.\n\n5) Why did the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality when it had such overwhelming bipartisan support, and when the effects of a repeal seem so dire?\n\nPretty much everybody supports net neutrality \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few bipartisan issues that most of Congress and most American citizens agree on. The glaring exceptions are the giant ISPs who are reigned in by the regulation.\n\nOver the last nine years, Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T have collectively spent over half a billion dollars lobbying the FCC to end regulatory oversight, and especially to block or repeal net neutrality. They found a loyal friend in Pai, who was appointed to the FCC in 2012 by then President Barack Obama, and named chairman by President Donald Trump shortly after Trump took office in January. Pai previously worked for Verizon and voted against the 2015 net neutrality ruling as a minority member of the FCC, calling it a \u201cmassive intrusion in the internet economy.\u201d\n\nSo Pai has basically always supported the repeal of net neutrality, despite the overwhelming public support for it. He believes the 2015 ruling was frivolous and unnecessary, and has also argued, in opposition to hard evidence, that investment in the internet shrinks when net neutrality is in effect. With Trump\u2019s full backing, he made undoing it a priority.\n\nIn fact, even though Pai is legally required to seriously consider the voice of the public when he makes decisions, he has made it clear that he never truly intended to consider most of the millions of comments submitted in support of net neutrality through the FCC\u2019s website since it began the repeal process in May. That\u2019s because the vast majority of those comments were duplicates that came through automated third-party advocacy websites. While many of them were likely submitted by spambots using fake or stolen identities and emails to file comments, many more of them were likely submitted by people using the tried-and-true method of sending a form letter to the government to express their opinions. Pai also rejected the form letters out of hand: Once the number of duplicate comments came to light, the FCC declared that it would be rejecting all duplicated comments as well as \u201copinions\u201d that came without \u201cintroducing new facts.\u201d\n\nEssentially, even though nearly 99 percent of the unique comments that the FCC received were pro-net neutrality and anti-repeal, and even though the entire point of a democratic process is to allow people to express their opinions, the FCC chose to dismiss pretty much every opinion that was expressed, because spambots and auto-duplicated opinions were involved. FCC commissioner Rosenworcel, one of the commission\u2019s two minority Democrats, acknowledged this during the December 14 vote to repeal, noting \"the cavalier disregard this agency has demonstrated to the public.\u201d\n\nAs Dell Cameron at Gizmodo put it, \u201cTo be clear, when the FCC says that it is \u2018restoring internet freedom,\u2019 it is not talking about your freedom or the freedom of consumers.\u201d\n\n6) What\u2019s happened since the FCC voted to repeal?\n\nA lot. Proponents of net neutrality have been busy at all levels of government trying to undo the FCC\u2019s ruling. In March, Washington became the first state to protect net neutrality, by enacting a law that prohibits any ISP servicing the state to block or slow traffic. A month later, Oregon followed suit with a similar law. Two even tougher bills are currently being pushed through California and New York state legislature.\n\nThese laws, while feisty, aren\u2019t foolproof: The FCC\u2019s ruling includes a dictum that states aren\u2019t allowed to self-regulate to protect net neutrality. Therefore, unless the FCC\u2019s ruling itself is overturned, these laws stand in danger of being overturned in court.\n\nThe path Congress is taking is more direct but very thorny. The Congressional Repeal Act, under which Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) petitioned to force a vote to overturn the FCC ruling, means proponents of net neutrality only need a simple majority. But despite overwhelming bipartisan public support, that\u2019s not a given.\n\nMarkey\u2019s resolution to overturn the FCC ruling was a success in the Senate, where supporters needed just 51 votes; ultimately, it passed with 52. From there, however, the vote shifted to the House, where it now needs 218 votes to pass, meaning Democrats voting in a bloc would need to muster up 25 more votes from Republicans. That\u2019s unlikely to happen.\n\nAnd even if the CRA motion to repeal the repeal actually manages to make it out of Congress onto the president\u2019s desk, there\u2019s every possibility that Trump, in what many perceive as an ongoing quest to destroy Obama\u2019s legacy, will veto it.\n\nThat means that the best chance to reverse the FCC\u2019s net neutrality repeal may lie in the court system.\n\nMere hours after the FCC vote in December, a flurry of lawsuits from tech companies, internet activists, the competitive carrier association INCOMPAS, and think tanks descended upon Washington. A multi-state appeal of the ruling was announced by the attorney general of the state of New York, Eric Schneiderman (who recently resigned after multiple allegations of assault). The attorneys general of 22 other states joined the appeal by filing similar suits, which petitioned the US Court of Appeals for a review of the FCC\u2019s order.\n\nThe collection of suits were filed as a consolidated suit in both D.C. and San Francisco, and were eventually punted to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C. following an appeal from the petitioners to have the location moved from San Francisco. That request might sound counterintuitive, given that San Francisco is the home of Silicon Valley \u2014 but judges serving D.C. have presided over previous cases involving net neutrality three times in the last decade, and are well-equipped to understand the complexities of the case. This is crucial given that the court could well be the determining factor in whether the repeal ultimately takes effect.\n\n7) When will the repeal go into effect?\n\nTechnically, it already has. Some relatively minor parts of the FCC\u2019s repeal took effect on April 23, 2018, including the reclassification of the internet as an information service rather than a utility. The ruling\u2019s major consequences kicked in on June 11, after some red tape was cleared up.\n\nMeanwhile, now that the Senate has sent the joint resolution to the House, the House has until the end of the legislative session (which concludes at the end of 2018, when a new Congress will be sworn in) to vote on the Senate\u2019s resolution. Should the measure fail, it\u2019s still probable that the absence of net neutrality won\u2019t become immediately apparent. It\u2019s possible, for example, that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals could order a stay of the ruling while motions against it are still being heard and appeals are being deliberated.\n\nIn a nutshell, we don\u2019t know how long will it take to fight the repeal in the court system, so we can\u2019t know when \u2014 or if \u2014 it will take effect. And it\u2019s likely that even if a court overturns the FCC\u2019s decision, that court may only overturn part of it and not the entire thing.\n\nIn the meantime, the FCC regulation has already taken effect \u2014 and net neutrality activists like Fight for the Future have predicted that encroaching moves by corporate ISPs will be gradual and insidious rather than sudden and overnight. That\u2019s partly because the court situation is still a giant mess, so rolling out significant changes while the courts are still deciding the fate of the repeal could be disastrous.\n\nAnd partly, it\u2019s because corporations won\u2019t want you to notice the difference. It\u2019s easier to get the public to accept a gradual fee hike or change in the structure of your internet service over time than it would be to, for example, abruptly start charging you extra for access to your favorite websites. Gradual change will also give the ISPs time to ride out the public\u2019s mistrust, perhaps by claiming that net neutrality went away and the world didn\u2019t end.\n\nBut while that might be true at first, the reality is that in the long term, a net neutrality repeal makes the internet less democratic. What the final version of that repeal might look like, and when it might take effect, are both unknown at this point \u2014 with the future of an open internet hanging in the balance.\n\nUpdate: This piece was originally written in December 2017.
