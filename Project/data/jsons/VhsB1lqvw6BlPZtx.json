As silly as the president declaring \u201c SEE YOU IN COURT \u201d in all caps on Twitter is , it \u2019 s not exactly a sign that he \u2019 s willing to bypass the judiciary altogether , which really would portend a crisis .\nBut with Trump tweeting attacks on \u201c so-called judges , \u201d and warning that decisions contrary to his wishes could lead to terrorist attacks , and Customs and Border Patrol officials at the nation \u2019 s airports initially ignoring court orders and according to some reports doing so on orders from the White House , it \u2019 s an understandable worry to have . Slate \u2019 s Mark Joseph Stern was one of the first to invoke the \u201c C \u201d word , the day after the executive order came down . On Thursday , Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-CT ) declared , after President Trump started openly disputing that his Supreme Court pick had criticized Trump \u2019 s treatment of the judiciary , that the country was , \u201c careening , literally , toward a constitutional crisis . \u201d\nSo I decided to ask eight leading experts \u2014 six constitutional law professors and two political scientists \u2014 for their thoughts . They were unanimous that the situation as it exists now doesn \u2019 t count as a constitutional \u201c crisis \u201d ; some cast doubt on whether that term , which has no firm definition , is even useful .\n\u201c Trash-talking the federal courts on Twitter does not create a constitutional crisis , \u201d Yale \u2019 s Jack Balkin explained . \u201c It 's a really bad idea , but there are many really bad ideas that are not constitutional crises . \u201d\nBut most experts said that if Trump were to start defying court edicts , that would very possibly qualify , and even his mere rhetoric ramps up conflict with the judiciary in a counterproductive and perhaps dangerous way .\nAnd they were sure to add that even if we \u2019 re not in a constitutional crisis , that doesn \u2019 t at all imply that what is happening is normal , or moral , or fair , or decent . \u201c I don \u2019 t like the phrase \u2018 constitutional crisis \u2019 because it has this contention that unless the whole system is up for grabs , we shouldn \u2019 t care about an 18- or 19-year-old kid in Chicago who is so anxious about being deported he takes his own life , \u201d Aziz Huq , a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago , noted . \u201c Crises happen everywhere on a micro scale . Just because they are happening to people on the margins doesn \u2019 t make them less important . \u201d\nThere are two major papers in the American constitutional law literature on the concept of a \u201c constitutional crisis. \u201d The first , from Princeton political scientist Keith Whittington , was written in the wake of the impeachment of President Clinton and the contested 2000 election , both of which provoked fears that the US was either in , or barely avoided , a constitutional crisis . Whittington argued that neither came close to qualifying .\n`` Constitutional crises arise out of the failure , or strong risk of failure , of a constitution to perform its central functions , '' he wrote . That did n't happen in the impeachment ( which unfolded according to the procedures laid out in Articles 1 and 2 ) or in the 2000 election ( in which decisions of executive branch officials in Florida were challenged through normal legal channels and all actors respected the ultimate decision of the US Supreme Court , whether or not they thought it was rightly decided ) .\nSo what would qualify ? Whittington divided constitutional crises into two categories . Operational crises occur `` when important political disputes can not be resolved within the existing constitutional framework. \u201d That is , the Constitution itself is failing , and is allowing people engaged in a political conflict to each behave in ways that together can result in calamity . A \u201c crisis of constitutional fidelity , \u201d by contrast , occurs when , \u201c important political actors threaten to become no longer willing to abide by existing constitutional arrangements or systematically contradict constitutional proscriptions . '' That \u2019 s when what the Constitution prescribes is clear , but one or more politician or branch of government willfully defies it .\nThe secession crisis of 1860 was , Whittington argues , both an operational and a fidelity crisis . It was a fidelity crisis because some political actors \u2014 namely the seceding Southern states \u2014 refused to obey the dictates of the Constitution and explicitly rejected its power over them . But it was an operational crisis too , because , `` the text of the Constitution was silent on the question of secession , and it provided no clear mechanism for resolving the contested question of whether and how states could secede from the Union . ''\nWhittington told me via email that he doesn \u2019 t think the current standoff between Trump and the judiciary qualifies as either a fidelity or operational crisis . While Trump 's comments are , he says , `` certainly disquieting , '' he adds that `` disagreements between the executive and the courts are not uncommon , and are sometimes expressed rather strongly . ''\nWhat would change matters is if Trump were to receive an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court \u2014 and ignore it . \u201c If the president were really to contemplate ignoring a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court , we 'd be in nearly uncharted waters , \u201d Whittington adds . He noted that the US has come close to that scenario in the past , but that in just about every case either the president or the Court backed down before an explicit violation occurred . For instance , in 1974 the Supreme Court ruled that Richard Nixon had to hand over the Watergate tapes to the special prosecutor \u2019 s office , and Nixon briefly considered not complying , as he strongly felt the president should not be subject to judicial proceedings outside of impeachment . But strong pressure from congressional Republicans and the threat that he would be impeached anyway caused him to back down and comply .\nBalkin agrees that open defiance of clear court dictates could qualify as a crisis . He and UT Austin 's Sanford Levinson published the other widely cited article besides Whittington \u2019 s categorizing and analyzing constitutional crisis . In addition to Whittington 's two categories , they add a third : when two or more political actors each strongly believe the other is violating the Constitution or constitutional norms . In fidelity crises , it \u2019 s clear that only one side is violating the Constitution . In operational crises , it \u2019 s clear both sides are obeying the Constitution . In type three power struggle crises ( \u201c power struggle \u201d is my term , not theirs , but it \u2019 s clearer than \u201c type three \u201d ) , each side has a real argument that it \u2019 s obeying and the other isn \u2019 t .\nBalkin and Levinson offer a number of examples of power struggle crises , including the Nullification Crisis ( in which South Carolina claimed it had the constitutional right to not enforce a federal tariff , Andrew Jackson claimed it did n't , and each had arguments for why they were right ) , the conflict between Andrew Johnson and Congress over each one 's role in Reconstruction , and the Little Rock Crisis in 1957 between the government of Arkansas and the Eisenhower administration .\n`` We are not having a constitutional crisis , at least not yet , '' Balkin told me via email , elaborating on a blog post he published on the topic . `` Trump has not announced that he is going outside the Constitution , and he has not openly defied a judicial order . \u2026 If he does either of these things , and he wo n't back down , then we would be in a constitutional crisis . \u201d\nNo expert I talked to , including Whittington and Balkin , characterized the current situation as a constitutional crisis . \u201c As far as we know , the executive is complying \u201d with court orders , Yale \u2019 s Heather Gerken says . \u201c That \u2019 s not a constitutional crisis . That \u2019 s a constitution working . \u201d\nLuckily , the legal literature has developed other , arguably clearer , categories for talking about heated conflict like this . In 2004 , Mark Tushnet , now at Harvard Law , introduced the concept of `` constitutional hardball '' : when political actors are clearly acting within their legal and institutional limits , but are violating past practices or norms in a way that feels unprecedented and provides advantage to their side .\nFor example , he argues that Republican efforts to redistrict congressional seats in Texas and Colorado in 2003 , after they had already redistricted for the census , count as constitutional hardball , as does the impeachment effort against Bill Clinton , as does Democrats \u2019 obstruction of appellate nominees in the early George W. Bush administration . In none of those cases was anybody acting outside their prerogative per the Constitution . But in every case , they were using those powers in new and tough ways that caught their opponents off guard .\n\u201c In the current spat , if there is hardball going on , it takes the form of White House people bypassing the established systems for vetting executive orders , \u201d Tushnet told me . \u201c Not submitting them to career people in the Office of Legal Counsel , but sending it apparently only to the political , shadow person they sent over there . They can say , \u2018 We did send it to OLC , \u2019 but the person who got it is not the kind of person who \u2019 d ordinarily be used to vet these issues . \u201d\nBut he was open to the idea that Trump \u2019 s rhetoric against the judiciary could count too . \u201c The more or less formal definition of constitutional hardball is that it consists of actions that are inconsistent with settled ways of doing things . In a political context , statements and rhetoric count as actions , \u201d he explained . \u201c I want to say I didn \u2019 t draw that distinction when I initially developed the idea . Now that we \u2019 ve had more examples , rhetoric can count as a form of constitutional hardball . \u201d\nThe University of Chicago \u2019 s Eric Posner and Harvard \u2019 s Adrian Vermeule introduced the parallel concept of \u201c constitutional showdowns , \u201d in 2008 . The idea is similar to the idea of hardball , but focuses more on the precedents that such conflicts can create . A constitutional showdown , Posner and Vermeule wrote , is a `` a disagreement between branches of government over their constitutional powers that ends in the total or partial acquiescence by one branch in the views of the other and that creates a constitutional precedent . ''\nThey cite , as examples , the conflict between Nixon and the Supreme Court over the Watergate tapes ( in which Nixon totally acquiesced and a new precedent was created limiting the president 's powers ) , the conflict between the Court and Harry Truman over seizing a steel mill ( Truman backed down , creating another precedent limiting presidential powers ) , Abraham Lincoln 's refusal to obey an order from Chief Justice Roger Taney to release a man arrested by Union troops in 1861 ( which created a new precedent enhancing the president \u2019 s war powers ) , and Andrew Jackson 's refusal to help enforce a Supreme Court ruling in 1832 that Georgia 's laws did not apply in Indian territory ( which set a precedent , since contradicted by events like the Little Rock Crisis in 1957 , of presidents not always acting to enforce federal rulings against state governments ) .\nPosner has been clear that he views Trump \u2019 s attacks on the judiciary as a very serious matter . He used a New York Times op-ed to urge Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch to condemn Trump \u2019 s behavior ( presaging Gorsuch \u2019 s comments that Trump \u2019 s rhetoric is \u201c disappointing and disheartening \u201d ) . But he has also written that the present situation doesn \u2019 t rise to the level of \u201c constitutional crisis. \u201d \u201c If Trump ordered border agents to disregard judicial orders blocking the executive order , \u201d that would qualify , he told me in an email .\nBut for now we \u2019 re in a constitutional showdown of a more ordinary variety . \u201c I think showdowns are unavoidable because constitutional rules do not necessarily keep up with the times ( while amendment has proven to be too difficult to revise them in a timely fashion ) , and government depends on cooperation among different institutions , \u201d Posner said . And who is right in each showdown can vary . You can think it was right of Lincoln to claim the power to suspend habeas corpus in wartime , but not for Jackson to decline to use federal force to protect Indian rights ( and then to use it to commit ethnic cleansing ) .\n\u201c But , \u201d he added , \u201c the rule that the president obeys a judicial order in peacetime is ancient , and it is well established to be a good one except if the judiciary goes haywire , which is certainly not the case here. \u201d Violating that norm would go further than Nixon , Truman , Lincoln , or even , arguably , Jackson went . And Trump ordering border agents to enforce his executive order when judges are telling them not to would violate that norm .\nSuppose we get into a crisis . Could Trump then be stopped ?\nWhile no one I talked to declared the situation right now a crisis , many expressed concern that President Trump is all too willing to provoke one .\n\u201c Remember Trump 's statement before the election : \u2018 I 'll accept the results , if I win \u2019 ? \u201d Alice Ristroph , a law professor and political theorist at Seton Hall who has written about constitutional crises , says . \u201c I think this administration will accept and preserve the basic structure of the American constitutional system if that system can be manipulated to give the administration what it wants . If Trump is overruled by the courts , who knows what will happen . Maybe a crisis . \u201d\nSo what happens then ? A lot depends on how institutional actors respond . An\u00edbal P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n , a comparative political scientist at the University of Pittsburgh who studies presidential democracies in Latin America , including constitutional crises experienced there , notes , `` Many countries modeled their constitutions after the US , but most presidential regimes have experienced much more turbulent histories . The reason for American stability lies in the fact that politicians in both parties historically exercised civility and reached deals to process their disagreements . '' That norm , of course , would take a major battering if Trump rejected a Court edict .\nIn that case , there would be two broad possibilities . One is that Trump , despite an initial rejection , somehow backs down . For that to happen , someone would have to persuade or force him . It could be his close advisers telling him he \u2019 s gone too far . It could be his own vice president and Cabinet , who could threaten to remove him by invoking the 25th Amendment . But institutionally , the people who are supposed to keep him in check in a case like that are members of Congress .\n\u201c The crucial thing for both the Court and the president is how Congress , and particularly the congressional Republicans , position themselves on a potential conflict , \u201d Whittington says . \u201c If the Republicans make it clear that they would not support presidential defiance of the Court , it would strengthen the hand of the judiciary . \u2026 It would seem unlikely that congressional Republicans , or even the president 's own Cabinet , would be willing to do lasting damage to the courts over these sorts of normal policy disagreements . \u201d\nAnd what if no one keeps him in check ? Then you get the possibility that the Court will be duly chastened , a new precedent will be set where its powers are greatly reduced , and the president emerges more powerful than before . \u201c Purges of supreme courts or constitutional tribunals have been a common affair in Latin America , where many presidents have little tolerance for dissent , \u201d P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n notes . Poland \u2019 s governing party has recently been cracking down on its Constitutional Tribunal in similar ways , raising serious concerns that the rule of law is eroding and democracy is backsliding .\nTushnet argues that a move like this by Trump , unchallenged , needn \u2019 t necessarily amount to democratic backsliding . It would usher in a new \u201c constitutional order , \u201d in Tushnet \u2019 s words , but such transitions can be either good or bad and aren \u2019 t always harbingers of democratic collapse .\n\u201c It might be that what the president is on the way to doing is becoming an authoritarian unconstrained by law entirely , \u201d he explains . \u201c But it could be that the president \u2019 s position is , \u2018 With respect to border control and national security , the courts have overstepped their bounds , I \u2019 m acting to make sure we have an appropriate relationship with the courts in that domain , and I don \u2019 t have a general quarrel with the rule of law. \u2019 \u2026 It could be a component of a new settlement of relations among the branches that would not be a departure from core notions of the rule of law . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t like what Trump is doing , \u201d he clarifies , \u201c but I \u2019 m willing to present it in a conceptual or constitutional theory framework that is independent of my particular views of this particular president . \u201d\nHuq , of the University of Chicago , notes that it \u2019 s hardly unusual for executive branch officials to drag their feet in implementing court decisions . Think of state officials failing to desegregate after Brown v. Board of Education , or the aftermath of Boumediene v. Bush , a 2008 Supreme Court decision that ruled Guantanamo detainees had a right to federal court review of their detention but that did not result in many detainees getting that review or being released , due , Huq argues , to \u201c internal bureaucratic resistance . \u201d\n\u201c But , \u201d he also notes , \u201c it \u2019 s hard to think of examples when the resistance starts off before the cases have been fully litigated . Where there \u2019 s zero willingness , up front , to comply . I can \u2019 t think of cases where resistance and refusal to comply have been coupled with an attack on the judiciary and an attempt to offset blame for bad political outcomes on the judiciary . That \u2019 s another example of a norm with respect to the Constitution that we \u2019 ve just blown apart . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s what makes Trump \u2019 s case so different . In a recent paper titled \u201c How to Lose a Constitutional Democracy , \u201d Huq and his University of Chicago colleague Tom Ginsburg argue that a wholesale \u201c authoritarian reversion , \u201d along the lines of Hitler \u2019 s rise to power in 1933 or Gen. Sisi \u2019 s coup in Egypt in 2013 , is unlikely in the US , for a variety of reasons . But \u201c constitutional retrogression \u201d \u2014 the slow erosion of democratic norms and institutions \u2014 is becoming more common abroad , and poses a real risk for the US . That \u2019 s the process by which Vladimir Putin \u2019 s Russia , Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s Venezuela , Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan \u2019 s Turkey , and Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2019 s Hungary have moved away from democracy and toward authoritarianism .\nIn other countries , constitutional amendments to bolster incumbent leaders ' power have played a significant role . But Huq and Ginsburg do n't think that 's likely , not least because Article 5 of the Constitution makes amendments extremely difficult to pass . Instead , they write , `` The most likely motor of antidemocratic dynamics in the American political system is the presidency , acting with the acquiescence of a co-partisan Congress. \u201d Helping along a presidency-driven retrogression would be an acquiescent judiciary ( perhaps chastened by a president who doesn \u2019 t obey Supreme Court rulings he doesn \u2019 t like ) and an erosion of electoral competition due to , say , voter ID laws and partisan districting .\n\u201c What I would count as democratic backsliding is a substantial negative change along three different elements or institutions happening at the same time , \u201d Huq says . \u201c Those three elements are the necessary institutional foundations of democracy , such that if you don \u2019 t have those institutional features , you can \u2019 t really have democracy . One is the possibility of political competition . The second is the rule of law . The third is the quality of liberal rights of speech and association that are necessary to the democratic process . \u201d\nTrump ignoring a court order would harm the rule of law but not necessarily the other two ; in itself , it might not constitute backsliding . It could just be a rearranging of power between the branches , as Tushnet suggests . But Trump \u2019 s past actions and statements suggest the other two criteria could be in danger too .\nHuq doesn \u2019 t think we \u2019 re in a constitutional crisis ( \u201c I don \u2019 t know what the term \u2018 constitutional crisis \u2019 means , which I feel like is a very law professor thing to say , \u201d he jokes ) or that we \u2019 re engaged in democratic backsliding . But he thinks the danger is real and worth considering .",

A constitutional showdown, Posner and Vermeule wrote, is a \"a disagreement between branches of government over their constitutional powers that ends in the total or partial acquiescence by one branch in the views of the other and that creates a constitutional precedent.\"\n\nThey cite, as examples, the conflict between Nixon and the Supreme Court over the Watergate tapes (in which Nixon totally acquiesced and a new precedent was created limiting the president's powers), the conflict between the Court and Harry Truman over seizing a steel mill (Truman backed down, creating another precedent limiting presidential powers), Abraham Lincoln's refusal to obey an order from Chief Justice Roger Taney to release a man arrested by Union troops in 1861 (which created a new precedent enhancing the president\u2019s war powers), and Andrew Jackson's refusal to help enforce a Supreme Court ruling in 1832 that Georgia's laws did not apply in Indian territory (which set a precedent, since contradicted by events like the Little Rock Crisis in 1957, of presidents not always acting to enforce federal rulings against state governments).\n\nPosner has been clear that he views Trump\u2019s attacks on the judiciary as a very serious matter. He used a New York Times op-ed to urge Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch to condemn Trump\u2019s behavior (presaging Gorsuch\u2019s comments that Trump\u2019s rhetoric is \u201cdisappointing and disheartening\u201d). But he has also written that the present situation doesn\u2019t rise to the level of \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d \u201cIf Trump ordered border agents to disregard judicial orders blocking the executive order,\u201d that would qualify, he told me in an email.\n\nBut for now we\u2019re in a constitutional showdown of a more ordinary variety. \u201cI think showdowns are unavoidable because constitutional rules do not necessarily keep up with the times (while amendment has proven to be too difficult to revise them in a timely fashion), and government depends on cooperation among different institutions,\u201d Posner said. And who is right in each showdown can vary. You can think it was right of Lincoln to claim the power to suspend habeas corpus in wartime, but not for Jackson to decline to use federal force to protect Indian rights (and then to use it to commit ethnic cleansing).\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthe rule that the president obeys a judicial order in peacetime is ancient, and it is well established to be a good one except if the judiciary goes haywire, which is certainly not the case here.\u201d Violating that norm would go further than Nixon, Truman, Lincoln, or even, arguably, Jackson went. And Trump ordering border agents to enforce his executive order when judges are telling them not to would violate that norm.\n\nSuppose we get into a crisis. Could Trump then be stopped?\n\nWhile no one I talked to declared the situation right now a crisis, many expressed concern that President Trump is all too willing to provoke one.\n\n\u201cRemember Trump's statement before the election: \u2018I'll accept the results, if I win\u2019?\u201d Alice Ristroph, a law professor and political theorist at Seton Hall who has written about constitutional crises, says. \u201cI think this administration will accept and preserve the basic structure of the American constitutional system if that system can be manipulated to give the administration what it wants. If Trump is overruled by the courts, who knows what will happen. Maybe a crisis.\u201d\n\nSo what happens then? A lot depends on how institutional actors respond. An\u00edbal P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n, a comparative political scientist at the University of Pittsburgh who studies presidential democracies in Latin America, including constitutional crises experienced there, notes, \"Many countries modeled their constitutions after the US, but most presidential regimes have experienced much more turbulent histories. The reason for American stability lies in the fact that politicians in both parties historically exercised civility and reached deals to process their disagreements.\" That norm, of course, would take a major battering if Trump rejected a Court edict.\n\nIn that case, there would be two broad possibilities. One is that Trump, despite an initial rejection, somehow backs down. For that to happen, someone would have to persuade or force him. It could be his close advisers telling him he\u2019s gone too far. It could be his own vice president and Cabinet, who could threaten to remove him by invoking the 25th Amendment. But institutionally, the people who are supposed to keep him in check in a case like that are members of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe crucial thing for both the Court and the president is how Congress, and particularly the congressional Republicans, position themselves on a potential conflict,\u201d Whittington says. \u201cIf the Republicans make it clear that they would not support presidential defiance of the Court, it would strengthen the hand of the judiciary. \u2026 It would seem unlikely that congressional Republicans, or even the president's own Cabinet, would be willing to do lasting damage to the courts over these sorts of normal policy disagreements.\u201d\n\nBut what if no one stops him?\n\nAnd what if no one keeps him in check? Then you get the possibility that the Court will be duly chastened, a new precedent will be set where its powers are greatly reduced, and the president emerges more powerful than before. \u201cPurges of supreme courts or constitutional tribunals have been a common affair in Latin America, where many presidents have little tolerance for dissent,\u201d P\u00e9rez-Li\u00f1\u00e1n notes. Poland\u2019s governing party has recently been cracking down on its Constitutional Tribunal in similar ways, raising serious concerns that the rule of law is eroding and democracy is backsliding.\n\nTushnet argues that a move like this by Trump, unchallenged, needn\u2019t necessarily amount to democratic backsliding. It would usher in a new \u201cconstitutional order,\u201d in Tushnet\u2019s words, but such transitions can be either good or bad and aren\u2019t always harbingers of democratic collapse.\n\n\u201cIt might be that what the president is on the way to doing is becoming an authoritarian unconstrained by law entirely,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut it could be that the president\u2019s position is, \u2018With respect to border control and national security, the courts have overstepped their bounds, I\u2019m acting to make sure we have an appropriate relationship with the courts in that domain, and I don\u2019t have a general quarrel with the rule of law.\u2019 \u2026 It could be a component of a new settlement of relations among the branches that would not be a departure from core notions of the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like what Trump is doing,\u201d he clarifies, \u201cbut I\u2019m willing to present it in a conceptual or constitutional theory framework that is independent of my particular views of this particular president.\u201d\n\nHuq, of the University of Chicago, notes that it\u2019s hardly unusual for executive branch officials to drag their feet in implementing court decisions. Think of state officials failing to desegregate after Brown v. Board of Education, or the aftermath of Boumediene v. Bush, a 2008 Supreme Court decision that ruled Guantanamo detainees had a right to federal court review of their detention but that did not result in many detainees getting that review or being released, due, Huq argues, to \u201cinternal bureaucratic resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he also notes, \u201cit\u2019s hard to think of examples when the resistance starts off before the cases have been fully litigated. Where there\u2019s zero willingness, up front, to comply. I can\u2019t think of cases where resistance and refusal to comply have been coupled with an attack on the judiciary and an attempt to offset blame for bad political outcomes on the judiciary. That\u2019s another example of a norm with respect to the Constitution that we\u2019ve just blown apart.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what makes Trump\u2019s case so different. In a recent paper titled \u201cHow to Lose a Constitutional Democracy,\u201d Huq and his University of Chicago colleague Tom Ginsburg argue that a wholesale \u201cauthoritarian reversion,\u201d along the lines of Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933 or Gen. Sisi\u2019s coup in Egypt in 2013, is unlikely in the US, for a variety of reasons. But \u201cconstitutional retrogression\u201d \u2014 the slow erosion of democratic norms and institutions \u2014 is becoming more common abroad, and poses a real risk for the US. That\u2019s the process by which Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s Venezuela, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkey, and Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary have moved away from democracy and toward authoritarianism.\n\nIn other countries, constitutional amendments to bolster incumbent leaders' power have played a significant role. But Huq and Ginsburg don't think that's likely, not least because Article 5 of the Constitution makes amendments extremely difficult to pass. Instead, they write, \"The most likely motor of antidemocratic dynamics in the American political system is the presidency, acting with the acquiescence of a co-partisan Congress.\u201d Helping along a presidency-driven retrogression would be an acquiescent judiciary (perhaps chastened by a president who doesn\u2019t obey Supreme Court rulings he doesn\u2019t like) and an erosion of electoral competition due to, say, voter ID laws and partisan districting.\n\n\u201cWhat I would count as democratic backsliding is a substantial negative change along three different elements or institutions happening at the same time,\u201d Huq says. \u201cThose three elements are the necessary institutional foundations of democracy, such that if you don\u2019t have those institutional features, you can\u2019t really have democracy. One is the possibility of political competition. The second is the rule of law. The third is the quality of liberal rights of speech and association that are necessary to the democratic process.\u201d\n\nTrump ignoring a court order would harm the rule of law but not necessarily the other two; in itself, it might not constitute backsliding. It could just be a rearranging of power between the branches, as Tushnet suggests. But Trump\u2019s past actions and statements suggest the other two criteria could be in danger too.\n\nHuq doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re in a constitutional crisis (\u201cI don\u2019t know what the term \u2018constitutional crisis\u2019 means, which I feel like is a very law professor thing to say,\u201d he jokes) or that we\u2019re engaged in democratic backsliding. But he thinks the danger is real and worth considering.\n\n\u201cMy view,\u201d he says, \u201cis that we\u2019re very vulnerable.\u201d",
