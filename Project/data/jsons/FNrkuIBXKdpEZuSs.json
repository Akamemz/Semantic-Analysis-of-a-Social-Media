Why Her Obama-Beating Numbers May Be an Illusion\nIs she the person who can unite the Democratic Party with a passion that President Obama increasingly lacks ?\nOr is this just a mirage created by the media at a time when the party needs a new figure to lead it out of the desert ?\nThe latest Washington Post/ABC poll makes clear that Hillary Clinton is significantly more popular than Barack Obama , and that , of course , has implications for 2016 .\nBut some pundits are overlooking the peculiar dynamics of the moment . Hillary is as popular right now as she \u2019 s ever going to be . She is out of the political crossfire , for the most part , giving speeches and preparing for book tour and looking forward to her first grandchild . She is not subjecting herself to tough interviews or having to take a stand on every flap of the day . Her fans can fantasize about what a second Clinton presidency would look like without her having to fill in many blanks .\nE.J . Dionne , the liberal Post columnist , bypasses this question , but he has an intriguing analysis of the polling numbers :\n\u201c Obama \u2019 s approval rating in the survey was just 41 percent , both with the general public and among registered voters . But in a hypothetical matchup with Jeb Bush for the 2016 presidential race , Clinton was favored by 53 percent of registered voters , Bush by 41 percent .\n\u201c The roughly one-eighth of voters who disapprove of Obama but nonetheless support Clinton for 2016 may be the most important group in the electorate . \u201d\nSo who are these people ? They are downscale Democrats , more moderate voters , the ones that Obama had difficulty winning in the 2008 primaries :\n\u201c The swing constituency is much more likely to be blue-collar and white \u2014 71 percent of the mixed group are white , compared with only 57 percent of the pro-Obama , pro-Clinton group , and it is also somewhat more Latino . Whites without college degrees constitute 47 percent of the Hillary Difference Voters but only 30 percent of the pro-Clinton , pro-Obama group . In keeping with this , 62 percent of the Hillary Difference Voters have incomes of less than $ 50,000 annually\u2026\n\u201c Ideologically , the swing group includes significantly fewer self-described liberals . Among the Hillary Difference Voters , only 29 percent call themselves liberal ; among those who both favor Clinton and approve of Obama , 43 percent are liberals . \u201d\nAnd , not surprisingly . 63 percent are women , slightly higher than Obama \u2019 s female support .\nBut I have to hammer this home : Is Hillary going to have that level of support after a campaign in which she is pounded hourly by the opposition and eviscerated by negative ads ? Of course not . It will be more of a dogfight than it appears right now .\nSome commentators can barely wait the 2-1/2 years until , in their view , Hillary moves back to her old address . Maureen Dowd , in her New York Times column , says the Clintons have eclipsed the incumbent :\n\u201c Both President Obama and Hillary have recently referred to leadership as a relay race . And if a fatigued and fed-up Obama looks ready to pass the baton early , the ravenous and relentless Clintons look ready to grab it \u2014 and maybe give him a few whacks over the head with it .\n\u201c Obama \u2019 s reign has become increasingly bloodless , and while the Clintons are not new blood , they do convey more vitality than the formerly electrifying politician in the White House .\n\u201c Things have now reached the point where it feels as though 42 and 45 have already taken over the reins of Washington power from 44 , who is fading Snapchat-fast . \u201d\nBut if and when Hillary takes the plunge\u2014and with pols like Sen. Tim Kaine endorsing her in advance , it \u2019 s harder to imagine she won \u2019 t\u2014she will be hammered on her record . And that includes Benghazi .\nThe aftermath of Benghazi came roaring back into the news last week with the release of an email showing another White House official involved in editing the infamous Susan Rice talking points , and with the House GOP moving to create a select committee to launch more hearings .\nMichael Hirsh , Politico \u2019 s national editor , unloads on what he calls the Benghazi Industrial Complex , built to harass Hillary over the issue . Hirsh says there are legitimate questions about Clinton \u2019 s handling of the situation in Benghazi , both before and after .\n\u201c But these are issues of competence , not corruption . There is as little evidence that Clinton or anyone else in the administration engaged in a cover-up of Benghazi as there is that Hillary ordered the whacking of her old friend Vince Foster .
