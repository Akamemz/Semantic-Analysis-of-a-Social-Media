    "content": "Are people who disagree with us necessarily evil ? Of course not . While advocating , defending , or fighting for our own principles and positions , harboring feelings of animosity toward our opponents is a poison that can rob us of our happiness and health .\nWhen I was in law school at Michigan nearly half a century ago , my criminal law professor shared a statement that I \u2019 ve never forgotten . He said that a clever person focuses on how he is different from others , while a wise person focuses on what he has in common with others . ( Thank you , professor Kamisar . )\nRecently , I found a point of agreement with a hardcore socialist . While doing some research about the allegations of sexual assault leveled against Virginia \u2019 s Lt. Gov . Justin Fairfax , I came across an article from the World Socialist Web Site . The author , Barry Grey , made two points that agreed with my conservative values : 1 ) Fairfax should not be denied due process of law ; and 2 ) we can \u2019 t automatically accept as true every allegation of sexual assault . ( Anyone familiar with the 1955 torture-murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till , whose female accuser recanted years later , would resist the siren call to \u201c always believe women . \u201d )\nI disagree with Grey \u2019 s overall politics . In his article , he laments the removal of Al Franken from the Senate \u201c after he was accused of minor sexual improprieties. \u201d His reason : Franken \u2019 s resignation shifted the balance of the Senate slightly toward the conservative side , rendering \u201c abortion rights \u201d less secure . Aha , I thought . Would Grey have defended pro-life Brett Kavanaugh \u2019 s right to due process last fall during Justice Kavanaugh \u2019 s confirmation hearings ?\nI went first to the Socialist Worker website , where I found a collection of opinions from eight of its contributors . Every single one of them called for Kavanaugh \u2019 s scalp , due process be damned . But when I tracked down Grey \u2019 s Oct. 4 commentary on the Kavanaugh hearings , he unflinchingly rebuked the Democratic lynch mob for rejecting \u201c the presumption of innocence \u201d and for showing \u201c contempt for basic democratic rights , including due process. \u201d Bravo ! While I remain miles apart from Grey \u2019 s political goals , I commend him for his integrity and courage in adhering faithfully to crucial principles of justice .\nThere is another recent issue where I find myself in agreement with a large number of people on the left . When Amazon announced that it was abandoning its plan to expand its headquarters into Queens , New York , the left exulted for a variety of reasons , most of them nonsensical and riddled with standard class-warfare boilerplate . Typical of the latter , Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) effusively wrote on Twitter , \u201c Today was the day a group of dedicated , everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon \u2019 s corporate greed , its worker exploitation , and the power of the richest man in the world . \u201d\nWhat actually happened was that Amazon decided to walk away from nearly $ 3 billion in tax breaks because of the financial beating they were facing from a cabal of NYC unions and politicians . Whatever \u201c greed \u201d Amazon was guilty of was exceeded by the unions \u2019 greed . The scheme that had been hatched in the cesspool of Big Apple politics was that Amazon would be lured by tax breaks , and then the unions would latch onto Amazon and leech billions away from it . Amazon was being wooed as the patsy , or the conduit , through which the $ 3 billion of tax breaks\u2014tax breaks that would have to be covered by the rest of the local taxpayers\u2014would pass through Amazon and end up in the pockets of unions and other political insiders .\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez called \u201c the power of the richest man in the world \u201d ( Jeff Bezos ) was no match for the power of the NYC political machine .

That prudent decision is a shame for the thousands of New Yorkers who would love to have been \u201c exploited \u201d ( Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s characterization ) by one of the many six-figure jobs that Amazon would have created in Queens .\nAll that having been said , I join with the progressives in celebrating that NYC \u2019 s taxpayers will no longer have to be stuck paying for a $ 3 billion subsidy to a private business . There is no principle of justice that justifies such a lavish privilege being bestowed on any private enterprise , much less a business as large and profitable as Amazon . Such political cronyism is unfair and corrupt .\nTragically , such cronyism is often erroneously called \u201c crony capitalism. \u201d The truth is that there is no such thing as \u201c crony capitalism \u201d any more than there is \u201c liquid ice \u201d ; both terms are oxymorons . Capitalism is a social system of economic cooperation , based on private property and voluntary exchanges , in which the government plays the role of an impartial referee while consumers choose winners and losers in freely competitive marketplaces .
