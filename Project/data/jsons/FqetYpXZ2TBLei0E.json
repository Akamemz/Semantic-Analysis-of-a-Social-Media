Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , on Monday released the results of his most recent annual physical exam , as well as letters from three of his doctors , making him the second septuagenarian in the Democratic presidential contest to offer an inside look at the details of his health .\n`` You are in good health currently , and you have been engaging vigorously in the rigors of your campaign , travel and other scheduled activities without any limitation , '' Dr. Brian Monahan , the attending physician for members of Congress , wrote .\nSanders ' latest physical exam was conducted on Dec. 19 , according to Monahan . The results of the exam revealed that the senator 's blood pressure , heart rate and blood tests were `` normal . '' Sanders is 6-feet tall and weighs 174 pounds , Monahan wrote in the letter , which is similar to what most recent presidential candidates have released .\nSanders has previously been treated for gout , high cholesterol , diverticulitis , hypothyroidism , laryngitis secondary to esophageal reflax , lumbar strain and has had superficial skin lesions removed , his doctor said . Sanders has also had minimally-invasive surgery to repair inguinal hernias on both his left and right sides and underwent a procedure to remove a vocal cord cyst .\nThe senator had his vocal cords evaluated for hoarseness last month and was `` stable , '' Monahan wrote in the letter . His daily medications include atorvastatin , aspirin , clopidogrel , levothyroxine and lisinopril , he added .\n`` You do not have a history of tobacco use , exercise daily and seldom drinks alcohol , '' Monahan said .\nSanders , the oldest candidate in the 2020 presidential contest , suffered a heart attack earlier this year while campaign in Las Vegas . He had had two stents inserted to fix a blockage in an artery and took himself off the campaign trail for several days to recover .\nSince then , Sanders has returned to the campaign trail and `` obtained additional consultation with cardiologists '' in his home state of Vermont , Monahan noted .\n`` Several of the medications you initially required ( blood-thinner , beta blocker ) were stopped based on your process . Your heart muscle strength has improved . You have never had symptoms of congestive heart failure . The heart chamber sizes , wall thickness , estimated pressures and heart valves are normal . Several 24-hour recordings of your heart electrical activity indicated no significant heart rhythm abnormality , '' he added .\nMonahan also noted that Sanders underwent a treadmill test earlier this month to find out how well his heart handles stress . Sanders ' performance was rated `` above average '' compared to men his age with a similar diagnosis , his doctor wrote , adding that `` the cardiac exercise psychologist who evaluated your results determined that you are fit to resume vigorous activity without limitation . ''\nSanders released a second letter from his cardiologists , Dr. Philip Ades and Dr. Patrick Savage . The doctors noted that during the aforementioned treadmill test , the senator `` was able to exercise to a level that is approximately 50 percent higher than other men his age with a similar diagnosis . '' Compared to men his age with no known heart disease , his exercise capacity is `` average , '' they wrote .\n`` Mr. Sander 's [ sic ] level of fitness would be suggestive of favorable outcomes from a cardiovascular perspective going forward , '' they wrote . Dr. Ades , director of preventive cardiology at the University of Vermont Medical Center , wrote that Sanders is `` more than fit enough to pursue vigorous activities and an occupation that requires stamina and an ability to handle a great deal of stress . ''\nIn a third letter from another one of Sanders ' doctors , Dr. Martin LeWinter , cardiologist at UVM Medical Center , said that while Sanders `` did suffer modest heart muscle damage , he has been doing very well since . ''\n`` He is entirely asymptomatic . His heart function is stable and well-preserved . His blood pressure and heart rate are in optimal ranges . He is getting regular exercise , and his exercise tolerance , based on quantitative , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , is well above average , '' LeWinter continued . `` At this point , I see no reason he can not continue campaigning without limitation , and should he be elected , I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency . ''\nSanders ' disclosure of his medical history and recent examinations come as several of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 who are in their 70s , along with President Donald Trump , who is 73 \u2014 have faced questions about their age and physical fitness .\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who is 70 , released her medical records earlier this month . The other septuagenarian in the race , former Vice President Joe Biden , 77 , vowed to release his health information before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 .\nDespite the concerns of some about their ages , Biden , Sanders and Warren have been at the top of virtually every national and early state polls of the Democratic primary .
