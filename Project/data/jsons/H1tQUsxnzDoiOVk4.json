( Update : Eurozone consumer prices fall sharply ) .\nInvestors cheered the ECB \u2019 s commitment to flood the eurozone with more than \u20ac1 trillion ( $ 1.16 trillion ) in newly created money , sparking a rally in stock and bond markets and sending the euro plunging .\nBut in light of Europe \u2019 s underlying problems of stagnant growth , high debt and rigid labor markets , ECB President Mario Draghi suggested the central bank \u2019 s largess alone won \u2019 t be enough to right its economy .\n\u201c What monetary policy can do is create the basis for growth , \u201d he said . \u201c But for growth to pick up , you need investment ; for investment , you need confidence ; and for confidence , you need structural reform . \u201d\nThe reactions to the central bank \u2019 s move rippled widely through the world \u2019 s trading floors , corporate boardrooms and European capitals . \u201c It \u2019 s one piece of getting Europe back to growth , and we should see an impact , \u201d Joe Jimenez , chief executive of drug giant Novartis said in an interview in Davos , Switzerland , where the political and economic elite are gathered for meetings of the World Economic Forum .\nThe effects also reverberated beyond the borders of the 19-member eurozone : Denmark on Thursday cut its main interest rate for the second time in a week , seeking to damp investor interest in its currency as investors sold the euro .\nMr. Draghi said the ECB will buy a total of \u20ac60 billion a month in assets including government bonds , debt securities issued by European institutions and private-sector bonds . The purchases of government bonds and those issued by European institutions such as the European Investment Bank will start in March and are intended to run through to September 2016 . Mr. Draghi signaled the purchases could extend further if the ECB isn \u2019 t meeting its inflation target of just below 2 % . In December , consumer prices fell 0.2 % in December on an annual basis in the eurozone , the first drop in over five years .\nThe ECB \u2019 s new stimulus \u201c should strengthen demand , increase capacity utilization and support money and credit growth , \u201d Mr. Draghi said .\nHe rejected any criticism that the vast expansion of the ECB \u2019 s easy-money policies would stoke inflation down the road , noting that inflation has stayed very low even after several interest-rate cuts and abundant ECB loans to banks . \u201c There must be a statute of limitations for those who say there will be inflation , \u201d he said .\nIn a nod to concerns in healthier euro countries over the prospect of assuming risks tied to their neighbors \u2019 debts , the ECB said government bonds will be mostly purchased by national central banks and excluded from potential loss sharing . Credit risks associated with the bonds of European Union institutions will be shared , however . \u201c We are not in a one-country setup , \u201d Mr. Draghi said .\nSome critics say that separating credit risks along national boundaries undermines the principle of one monetary policy for the whole eurozone , a charge Mr. Draghi rejected .\nUnder quantitative easing , central banks create new bank reserves to buy assets from financial institutions . Central banks get bonds , and banks get money that they can in turn use to extend new credit to households and businesses . Such expansionary monetary policies usually weaken an economy \u2019 s exchange rate , which boost exports . The euro weakened to 11-year lows after the ECB announcement as European bond prices rose .\nOfficials also kept their main lending rate unchanged at 0.05 % and a separate rate on overnight bank deposits parked with the central bank at minus 0.2 % , meaning banks must pay a fee to keep surplus funds at the ECB .\nBut the new ECB stimulus isn \u2019 t quite as large as the \u20ac60 billion figure suggests . The ECB included existing purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds under programs launched last year . Excluding those facilities , the new bond buys amount to about \u20ac50 billion a month , analysts said .\nThe launching of quantitative easing , which investors and many European governments have been pleading for , won \u2019 t necessarily solve Europe \u2019 s problems .\nFormer U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers described the ECB \u2019 s move as a \u201c broadly responsible central bank action , \u201d but said governments still need to make policy reforms . \u201c I think we need to realize the era of central bank improvisation as the world \u2019 s principal growth strategy is coming to an end , \u201d he said .\nThe biggest challenge for QE is whether it can break the economic stagnation that has gripped the eurozone in recent years , which has led to the crumbling of public confidence in Europe \u2019 s institutions and its political class .\nAn anemic economic recovery since 2013 has left joblessness too high and output and inflation too low to escape the damage of the 2008 global financial crisis , which was compounded by the eurozone \u2019 s subsequent sovereign-debt crisis . Long after most other major economies have recovered from the financial crisis era , the eurozone remains burdened by high debts , bad loans , sickly banks , stressed households and anemic demand .\nStubbornly high unemployment rates in most eurozone countries apart from Germany have led to voter revolts against established political parties , fueling the rise of extreme or populist parties ranging from anticapitalist far-left to xenophobic far-right . Surveys show public trust in the EU and its bodies , including the ECB , has suffered too\u2014although most voters across the eurozone remain firmly opposed to leaving the euro .\nNot all members of the central bank \u2019 s governing council supported the decision to buy government bonds . Mr. Draghi said there was a large majority in favor of launching the program and unanimity that , in principle , buying government bonds is \u201c a true monetary policy tool. \u201d But some council members didn \u2019 t think it was necessary to buy bonds now .
