    "content": "As Americans were just waking up for breakfast , they discovered that President Trump was ruining breakfast for NATO leaders .\nAnd many pundits were having a collective case of indigestion .\nThe sense of queasiness was perfectly captured when MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi declared , `` Wow , this looks like everyone 's nightmare Thanksgiving dinner . '' A CNN banner declared that the president `` Insults Allies . ''\nAnyone who thought Trump would go to Brussels , smile for photos and make polite chit-chat has n't been paying attention .\nBut the press is right to be covering this as more than a break-a-little-china moment . What the president is doing does represent a fundamental challenge to the western alliance that could have long-lasting repercussions .\nTrump has been complaining since taking office that some NATO members do n't spend enough on defense , leaving the U.S. shouldering too much of the burden , and it 's an issue that predates his tenure . But yesterday he broadened his assault in what the Washington Post called a `` blistering tirade . ''\nMany NATO members are `` delinquent , '' Trump told the breakfast session , and `` owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back . ''\nAnd then he went after Germany , saying it was `` totally controlled by Russia . '' The reason , Trump said , is that Angela Merkel 's government is doing a $ 10 billion pipeline project with a giant Russian firm and will be overly dependent on Russia for its energy as its `` captive . ''\n`` So we 're protecting you against Russia , but they 're paying billions of dollars to Russia , and I think that 's very inappropriate , '' he said .\nMerkel hit back on a personal note , saying she grew up in `` a part of Germany that was controlled by the Soviet Union , '' and she prefers today 's democratic state to East Germany .\nThe president has a bit of a point , in that America has NATO under its defense umbrella in part to resist Russian aggressiveness . But all western countries , including the United States , trade with Russia .\nThe larger question , given Trump 's determination to forge a friendly relationship with Vladimir Putin , is whether he sees much need for NATO , which he once called `` obsolete . '' On that point , the post-World War II NATO alliance is about more than confronting Russia . NATO members have cooperated on trouble spots around the world , and U.S. and NATO forces are now stationed in Afghanistan .\nThe press did n't have to look far for critics . Chuck Schumer called Trump 's comments an `` embarrassment '' and `` another profoundly disturbing signal that the president is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies . ''\nWhat 's striking , in watching the initial media freakout , is how Trump 's detractors are as upset with his two-fisted style as with the direction of the punches . There is a vital debate , to be sure , about the future of NATO , but many commentators are simply offended by Trump 's undiplomatic approach in challenging our allies .\nAnd yet within hours of the breakfast , Trump joined the other leaders in approving a plan to bolster defenses against Russia and terrorism .\nAnd that 's the thing that many Trump critics still fail to understand . To him , these meetings and summits are a show and he needs to deliver a riveting performance . It 's similar to what he did with his confrontational approach to the G-7 , where he picked a fight with Justin Trudeau .\nAnd what was the sitdown with Kim Jong-un if not a made-for-television extravaganza ?\nBut once that spotlight fades , it remains to be seen whether the administration negotiates sweeping changes ( not going so well in the case of North Korea ) or engages in compromise .\nAnd that , in the end , will be more important than what Trump said over a Belgian breakfast .",
