''\nSpeaking in a taped interview with CBS ' `` 60 Minutes , '' Obama said the terrorists were remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq , which after being diminished by U.S. forces `` went back underground . ''\n`` Over the past couple of years , during the chaos of the Syrian civil war , where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned , they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos , '' Obama said , adding later the U.S. also overrated Iraq 's security forces , which were quickly overrun by ISIS when it took over the northern city of Mosul this summer .\nThe President stressed that the issue in Iraq is not simply a military problem ; it 's a political one .\n`` This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with , to make sure that they are able to take care of their business , '' he told `` 60 Minutes . ''\nThe President added : `` If we do our job right and the Iraqis fight , then over time our role can slow down and taper off . ''\nObama spent much of last week rallying international support for his mission against ISIS at the United Nations , telling leaders there the fighters represent a `` network of death '' that must be defeated .\nAn air campaign , which began last week and included coalition support from five Arab nations , continued over the weekend with strikes on the northern Syrian city of Ayn al-Arab , where Kurdish forces have been battling ISIS .\nThe mission is meant to `` degrade and ultimately destroy '' ISIS , Obama says . The White House has remained adamant there wo n't be any U.S. combat forces deployed in Iraq or Syria , though military `` advisers '' have been sent to Iraq in the hopes of fortifying local security forces .\nThe President warned the campaign probably wo n't conclude any time soon .\n`` There is a cancer that has grown for too long that suggests that it is acceptable to kill innocent people who worship a different God .\n`` And that kind of extremism , unfortunately , means that we 're going to see for some time the possibility that in a whole bunch of different countries , radical groups may spring up -- particularly in countries that are still relatively fragile , where you had sectarian tensions , where you do n't have a strong state security apparatus .\n`` And that 's why what we have to do is , rather than play whack-a-mole and send U.S. troops wherever this occurs , we have to build strong partnerships , '' Obama told `` 60 Minutes . ''\nAides to Obama have been careful to underscore that the military operation in the Middle East wo n't resemble the wars of the past decade , which left many Americans skeptical of intervention abroad .\n`` We 're doing this in a very different way than in the past , '' Tony Blinken , a deputy national security adviser , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' with Candy Crowley .\n`` We 're not sending in hundreds of thousands of American troops , '' Blinken continued . `` We 're not spending trillions of American dollars .
