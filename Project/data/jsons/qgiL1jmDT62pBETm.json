    "content": "Make him president , and he \u2019 ll seem presidential . Make him a law professor , and he \u2019 ll seem professorial . In some other universe , there \u2019 s probably some alternate version of Obama who became a novelist and is widely regarded as one of America \u2019 s foremost men of letters .\nThis is not to say Obama is multitalented \u2014 though he is \u2014 but rather that he boasts the chameleon-like ability to make himself seem like a natural fit for wherever he ends up . I \u2019 m sure some of that skill can be attributed to his DNA and his upbringing , a biracial child being raised by his white grandparents . ( He \u2019 s made that argument himself in both of his memoirs . )\nBut just as much has to do with his confident , observational demeanor . Obama is great at hanging back , then delivering exactly the right quip at exactly the right moment . It \u2019 s easy to imagine him as the guy at the edge of the room , offering trenchant commentary about everybody dancing at its center . He belongs everywhere and nowhere all at once , and that can be disarming .\nAs Obama told the Atlantic \u2019 s Ta-Nehisi Coates of his days on the campaign trail :\nIf I walked into a room and it \u2019 s a bunch of white farmers , trade unionists , middle age \u2014 I \u2019 m not walking in thinking , Man , I \u2019 ve got to show them that I \u2019 m normal . I walk in there , I think , with a set of assumptions : like , these people look just like my grandparents . And I see the same Jell\u2011O mold that my grandmother served , and they \u2019 ve got the same , you know , little stuff on their mantelpieces . And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we \u2019 re okay .\nThis made Obama a pop culture president unlike any other . Bill Clinton was known for turning his considerable charm on anybody he met \u2014 talk show host and voting citizen alike . Meanwhile , George W. Bush often seemed like something of an awkward uncle , laughing at people \u2019 s jokes but not getting them .\nBut Obama was as comfortable on Fox News as he was on The Daily Show or reading mean tweets on Kimmel . He could play games with Jimmy Fallon or talk policy with journalists , and act demonstrably different with both . It often seemed like he truly understood pop culture , particularly hip-hop and prestige TV , the two most dominant cultural forms of his era . It was like he chose a persona for each occasion \u2014 goofy but proud dad , cool guy , serious wonk \u2014 and then stepped into it .\nIn this way , as in so many others , the man who is replacing him is his exact opposite . Barack Obama wears many hats . But Donald Trump is always Donald Trump , for better or worse .\nObama was roundly praised for his pop culture acumen . But was that acumen as useful as it was assumed to be ?\nIt might seem hard to believe now , but when Obama appeared on Jay Leno \u2019 s Tonight Show early in his presidency in 2009 , it was the first ever appearance from a sitting president on a late-night talk show . And he followed it up with appearances on every major late-night show that aired during his administration . Throw in Michelle Obama \u2019 s appearances on a host of other programs , and the Obamas \u2019 casual domination of pop culture seems either calculated or effortless depending on the color of the lenses you choose to wear . ( It doesn \u2019 t hurt that both halves of the couple are natural-born joke tellers , a skill that few presidents or first ladies possess . )\nI \u2019 m speaking as if Obama purposefully leaned into whatever TV show he was appearing on ( even the news ) , but that \u2019 s not strictly accurate . Sure , he chose which modes and tones to use in each situation , but he always had a certain sense of gravity to him , even when he was slow-jamming the news . Obama \u2019 s strength was in finding a way to move toward the center of the pop culture solar system but also pull it toward him , so they met in the middle , instead of awkwardly waving at each other across a wide gap .\nObama also curated the pop culture he consumed in a way that made him seem populist but still pretty cool . He watched Homeland when it was new and buzzworthy , and was the only person in the world to receive Game of Thrones season six screeners from HBO before the episodes aired on television . He liked Hamilton before it was cool .\nWhere Ronald Reagan had regularly hosted film screenings at the White House to swells of publicity ( fitting for a former film actor and Screen Actors Guild president ) , Obama seemed to understand that his cultural moment coincided with a cultural moment for hip-hop and prestige television \u2014 and adjusted his viewing patterns and guest lists accordingly .\nI don \u2019 t mean to sound cynical . Obama has been performing this sort of softshoe his whole political life . It \u2019 s why he rarely says something truly incendiary , but also why his supporters so often wish he would . To be Obama \u2014 to be black , but also have white heritage , but also participate in power structures still primarily designed for white men \u2014 is to tread carefully to a fault . He possessed immense power but often carried himself as an outsider , which is basically a description for every mega-celebrity ever .\nHollywood responded in kind , providing him with copious public support while also giving some Americans the sense that Obama was increasingly \u201c out of touch \u201d or didn \u2019 t understand the plight of those who didn \u2019 t regularly pal around with Beyonc\u00e9 or Lin-Manuel Miranda .\nI have always bristled at the idea that Obama \u2019 s pop culture savvy is genius , or central to his appeal , or something similar . I think it might be central to his appeal to his most fervent supporters . Indeed , I \u2019 ve loved a great many of his TV appearances . But I \u2019 ve also often wondered if they worked against him , chipped away at some of what made him relatable .\nLook at other presidents when they would intersect with pop culture , and you can see the flop sweat . Clinton was better at it than Bush , but only in the sense that there was something weirdly charming about Clinton when he was trying too hard . Watch his famous 1992 appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show , and you can see how much effort he \u2019 s investing to make everybody love him . ( Whenever Bush crossed over into pop culture , he usually seemed like he was terrified he might forget his lines . )\nObama never lets you see any uncertainty . And when you consider that his primary outreach to the average American \u2014 especially in his second term \u2014 has come from appearances on TV shows , the picture becomes more complicated .\nIn 2008 , Obama ran on a campaign of understanding people \u2019 s pain , if maybe not feeling it . He and his wife had just paid off their student loans a few years prior ! They shopped at Target ! They weren \u2019 t like you and me anymore \u2014 it would be hard for a US senator to not become part of the system \u2014 but they were close enough to those days to remember .\nTrace Obama \u2019 s pop culture encounters throughout his two terms , however , and you see a guy who increasingly seems almost more at home amid the laughter and lights of the Hollywood stage . Mind you , I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s literally true \u2014 Obama \u2019 s talent , again , is making you think he \u2019 s comfortable in pretty much any situation . But if you were a very particular sort of voter , one who thought the \u201c coastal elite \u201d had forgotten about the little guy , Obama \u2019 s looseness on late night played into a very old , very persistent criticism , one from the earliest days of his political career .\nDonald Trump is a pop culture wrecking ball . That makes him easier to relate to .\nOne of the right \u2019 s most persistent slurs against Obama during the 2008 election cycle was that he was running solely for his own ego , to become famous ( as if the campaign itself hadn \u2019 t already made him famous ) .\nTo many on the left , this suggestion seemed ridiculous ; Obama clearly had a whole platform he wanted to enact . But his level of fame and celebrity \u2014 and celebrity support \u2014 caused many on the right to see Obama as a vacuum . He came to stand for essentially any policy or program they could think of that they disagreed with , to the point that when Obama \u2019 s plans were inevitably more moderate or even right-leaning than they expected , it almost didn \u2019 t matter . The person selling them was a symbol of a coastal elitism they feared would leave them behind . ( I should note here that Obama \u2019 s race also played a role , though I will come back to that . )\nThe cottage industry of easily disproved rumors that sprang up around the Obamas ( like one declaring Michelle Obama to be a trans woman ) makes more sense in this context . Yes , the right had done something similar to the Clintons by , say , suggesting they had murdered former deputy White House counsel Vince Foster , but the Clinton family \u2019 s seeming hatred of the press and transparency provided fertile soil for rumors . Paradoxically , because the Obamas \u2019 frequent TV appearances made them seem more open \u2014 but also like characters on a show \u2014 even the most ridiculous rumors could take root .\nTo be sure , much of this was because Obama is black , and thus an unusual or even threatening figure to some . But Obama was also Hollywood , and that status brought with it an additional set of cultural assumptions and signifiers . Hollywood was a place of empty vacuousness and deep debauchery . It was the last place a president should seem so cozy in .\nIt \u2019 s ironic that for as much as conservatives lament the left \u2019 s supposed love of celebrity , the two presidents who have actual show business backgrounds are both Republicans : Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump . This strikes many on the left , including me , as bizarre \u2014 a kind of projection onto the left of the thing many on the right apparently want ( a celebrity president ) . But looking at Trump \u2019 s rise actually explains why this sort of candidate is so compelling to Republican voters .\nContrast any random Trump late-night appearance from throughout his decades of celebrity with any random Obama late-night appearance . Obama gently takes control of the show , while Trump just seems a little desperate to be liked , to fit in . Showbiz was never Trump \u2019 s natural home , but he wished it could be . That desire to be liked meant hosts could mock him endlessly and he would take it .\nI \u2019 ve known Donald Trump for a long time and I always thought he was exactly what New York City needed to have : the big , blowhard billionaire . \u201c By God , I \u2019 m Donald Trump and I date models and I put up buildings , and everything is gold. \u201d Nobody took him seriously , and people loved him when he would come on the show . I would make fun of his hair , I would call him a slumlord , I would make fun of his ties . And he could just take a punch like nothing . He was the perfect guest .\nWith that quote in mind , watch Obama \u2019 s 2011 White House Correspondents \u2019 Association Dinner evisceration of Trump \u2019 s pursuit of Obama \u2019 s \u201c long-form birth certificate. \u201d Trump laughs along , but you can visibly see , even from very far away , how uncomfortable he is . Even Obama \u2019 s milder zingers are clearly rattling him .\nTrump is happy to be humiliated , but usually only on his terms . ( See also : the list of topics that were off limits for his Comedy Central roast . ) Now he was being mocked when he didn \u2019 t expect to be , and savagely so . If you can put yourself in Trump \u2019 s shoes , even for a second , it \u2019 s easier to understand just how his supporters gravitated toward him as an exemplar of their many grievances , of the way the world seemed less attuned to them than ever before .\nIn a way , Trump and Obama \u2019 s TV personas perfectly exemplify their approaches to politics . Obama uses his wit as a tool . He can take it , and dish it out , and that makes him feel at home . But above all , he has to keep smiling . A lifetime of being a black man in America has made him understand that , if nothing else . You can only commandeer the stage if you don \u2019 t seem too threatening .\nTrump , however , is a boulder . You can land punch after punch after punch on him , and nothing will happen , until he abruptly rolls forward a couple of seconds later and crushes you . Donald Trump has been the butt of the joke \u2014 from late-night comedians , from regular people , from presidents even \u2014 for decades now , and even after an election he won , he \u2019 s spent an inordinate amount of time on Twitter trying to get people to stop making fun of him . Maybe all those years of grinning and bearing snipes and snide remarks were preparation for rolling forward , just a few inches .\nNo matter what situation he \u2019 s in , Trump will never be talented enough to tell jokes or keep his cool during interviews or spar with the hosts , but he \u2019 s somehow more interesting for that , because he keeps trying . ( See Emily Nussbaum for more on Trump \u2019 s standup-esque delivery . ) He \u2019 s always been a very rich white man in a country that bends itself to the whims of very rich white men . Why appear on TV at all ? Because he likes the attention .\nIf I were to zero in on Trump \u2019 s Achilles \u2019 heel , it would be that he needs our love , and especially needs our love if we \u2019 re famous people . It drives him a little nuts when he can \u2019 t get it . There \u2019 s a reason he rarely passed up a media opportunity in the early days of The Apprentice , back when nobody could get enough Trump . Watch how he lights up in a room full of applause . As his approval ratings sink , it \u2019 s not hard to imagine that neediness driving him into some sort of endless circle of self-destruction .\nAnd yet if I \u2019 m being honest , it \u2019 s far easier to identify with that need to be liked than it is to identify with Obama \u2019 s outsider cool . Barack Obama \u2019 s pop culture persona was the guy you maybe wanted to be someday when you grew up ; Donald Trump \u2019 s is the guy most of us already know we are , flailing and fumbling and as likely to hold on to petty grudges as anything .\nDo I want that man to be president ? Not particularly \u2014 but I \u2019 d be lying if I said I didn \u2019 t see something of myself in him .",
