    "content": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the federal government is on the hook for billions in payments to health insurers who sold coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges .\nThe eight to one decision clears the way for insurers to collect upwards of $ 12 billion via an Obamacare program designed to help insurers manage risks they took by participating in ACA exchanges . Congress has refused to appropriate federal money for the program since 2014 , leaving insurers in the lurch .\nThe decision is a blow to congressional Republicans and the Trump administration , who say the program is little more than a bailout for insurance companies who made hazardous business decisions . Unable to repeal the law in full , Republicans have attacked the ACA in piecemeal fashion , withholding the risk payments in Monday \u2019 s case and canceling payments to health insurers that subsidize care for low-income clients . Monday \u2019 s decision marks another failed Republican attempt to undermine the health care law .\nAt issue in the case is the so-called risk corridor program .
