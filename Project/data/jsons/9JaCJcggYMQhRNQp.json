    "content": "As you gentlemen undoubtedly know , Week 1 of the 2016 NFL season concluded with its usual and unusual fanfare : roaring crowds , jammed parking lots , overserved fans , heartfelt renditions of \u201c The Star Spangled Banner \u201d ( with some players kneeling , others raising their fists and an entire team locking arms ) and several exciting games decided by just one point .\nWhile each contest this past weekend had its own series of questionable plays , viewers were at least assured a baseline sense of accuracy and \u201c truth \u201d in the outcome . That \u2019 s because there \u2019 s a system in place to examine and confirm every score , turnover or controversial play . The NFL has tweaked its instant-replay rules over the years in an effort to offer a sense of transparency to fans , casual fantasy players and big-time bettors following the action in Vegas . Although there probably always will be some plays that will generate partisan debate , the NFL has basically brought \u201c fact-checking \u201d into its games through the use of instant replay .\nDoesn \u2019 t the most important contest in the country deserve the same treatment ? After working in Silicon Valley for the past decade , I have learned that digital technology can take democracy to a new level . Today facts , videos , photos and public documents are all readily available online for anyone to see . When presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump appeared on last week \u2019 s prime-time forum with NBC \u2019 s Matt Lauer , America \u2019 s collective BS detector started to sound \u2014 loudly .\nAlmost immediately , the electorate and the media began to question whether the moderators of the upcoming presidential debates can hold the candidates to a basic standard of truth .\nTherefore , since the future of our country and the world is at stake , I propose that the Commission on Presidential Debates change course and reform a clearly antiquated debate system and bring it into the information age . Specifically , I urge you , as heads of the commission , to leverage the technology built in this country by immigrants and the children of immigrants to perform real-time fact-checking on stage during the debates .\nHere is my proposal : During the first presidential debate on Sept. 26 , the moderator , NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt , should go about his business as usual , sitting in front of the candidates and posing questions \u2014 but be joined by a team of fact-checkers from Factcheck.org , a project run by the nonpartisan Annenberg Public Policy Center ( itself part of Donald Trump \u2019 s alma mater , the University of Pennsylvania ) . Just like in professional football games , each side would be given two challenges . The candidates could then use them over the course of the 90-minute debate . If one heard a \u201c lie \u201d during the other \u2019 s response , he or she could press a button that would illuminate a red light at his or her podium . Once the other side finished its response , the moderator would allow the candidate who \u201c threw the red flag \u201d to explicitly challenge the statement at issue .\nMembers of the fact-check team would then go to work to determine the veracity of the answer and relay their findings to the moderator . If the challenger were to be correct , then he or she would still have two challenges and the candidate whose statement was found false , well , would be shown to be a liar in front of the whole country . If , however , the challenge were to be unfounded \u2014 and the speaker \u2019 s statement is determined to be factually sound \u2014 then the challenger would lose one of his or her challenges and be shown as ill-informed .\nThe candidates wouldn \u2019 t be the only ones who could issue a challenge , however . Just like how the NFL automatically reviews plays during the last two minutes of a half , the debate moderator and the fact-checkers could weigh in on any possible mistruths after the closing remarks and make the call without a candidate \u2019 s being able to respond .\nSo careful what you say , Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton , because under this scenario you would not have the final word \u2014 the truth would .\nAlthough it \u2019 s no game-show gimmick , this new format would make for riveting political theater and has the potential to bring in more than the 100 million expected debate viewers .
