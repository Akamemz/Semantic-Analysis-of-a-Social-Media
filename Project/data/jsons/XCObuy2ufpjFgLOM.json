    "content": "California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes filed a major lawsuit seeking $ 250 million in compensatory damages and $ 350,000 in punitive damages against Twitter and a handful of its users on Monday , accusing the social media site of `` shadow-banning conservatives '' to secretly hide their posts , systematically censoring opposing viewpoints , and totally `` ignoring '' lawful complaints of repeated abusive behavior .\nIn a complaint filed in Virginia state court on Monday , obtained by Fox News , Nunes claimed Twitter wanted to derail his work on the House Intelligence Committee , which he chaired until 2019 , as he looked into alleged and apparent surveillance abuses by the government . Nunes said Twitter was guilty of `` knowingly hosting and monetizing content that is clearly abusive , hateful and defamatory \u2013 providing both a voice and financial incentive to the defamers \u2013 thereby facilitating defamation on its platform . ''\nThe lawsuit alleged defamation , conspiracy and negligence , as well as violations of the state 's prohibition against `` insulting words '' -- effectively fighting words that tend towards `` violence and breach of the peace . '' The complaint sought not only damages , but also an injunction compelling Twitter to turn over the identities behind numerous accounts he said harassed and defamed him .\n\u201c Twitter is a machine , '' Nunes ' personal attorney , Steven S. Biss , told Fox News . `` It is a modern-day Tammany Hall . Congressman Nunes intends to hold Twitter fully accountable for its abusive behavior and misconduct . \u201d\nAlthough federal law ordinarily exempts services like Twitter from defamation liability at all levels , Nunes ' suit said the platform has taken such an active role in curating and banning content -- as opposed to merely hosting it -- that it should face liability like any other organization that defames .\n`` Twitter created and developed the content at issue in this case by transforming false accusations of criminal conduct , imputed wrongdoing , dishonesty and lack of integrity into a publicly available commodity used by unscrupulous political operatives and their donor/clients as a weapon , '' Nunes ' legal team wrote . `` Twitter is 'responsible ' for the development of offensive content on its platform because it in some way specifically encourages development of what is offensive about the content . ''\nThe lawsuit is separate from Nunes ' work on the House Intelligence Committee , where he is now the ranking member . To prove his defamation charge , Nunes , as a public figure , would typically need to meet a higher standard than a private individual -- essentially that the defendants acted intentionally or recklessly with respect to the provable falsity of their posts , rather than than merely negligently .\nThe complaint also maintains in its action for negligence , however , that Twitter has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid hosting outwardly defamatory content because of its increasingly important role in current affairs .\n`` Access to Twitter is essential for meaningful participation in modern-day American Democracy , '' the complaint stated . `` A candidate without Twitter is a losing candidate . The ability to use Twitter is a vital part of modern citizenship . A presence on Twitter is essential for an individual to run for office or engage in any level of political organizing in modern America . That is because Twitter is not merely a website : it is the modern town square . Twitter is equivalent to the private owner of a public forum who has fully opened its property to the general public for purposes of permitting the public \u2019 s free expression and debate . That is , in fact , what Twitter has always claimed to be . ''\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has testified previously before Congress that his platform is a kind of `` digital public square , '' although he has insisted that Twitter , as a private company , retains the right to censor speech .\nIn large part because of Twitter 's actions , Nunes `` endured an orchestrated defamation campaign of stunning breadth and scope , one that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life '' in the past year , according to the complaint .\n`` Twitter is a machine . It is a modern-day Tammany Hall . '' \u2014 Devin Nunes ' personal attorney , Steven S. Biss\nThe complaint also named specific Twitter accounts that spread allegedly defamatory material about Nunes . One defendant , identified as `` Liz '' Mair , purportedly published tweets that `` implied that Nunes colluded with prostitutes and cocaine addicts , that Nunes does cocaine , and that Nunes was involved in a 'Russian money laundering front , ' '' according to Nunes ' lawyers .\nHOWARD KURTZ : IS TWITTER CORRUPTING JOURNALISM , OR EXPOSING ITS UTTER UNFAIRNESS ?\nThe complaint quoted a June 22 , 2018 tweet from Mair that implied Nunes invested in a winery that `` allegedly used underage hookers to solicit investment . ''\nMair did not respond to Fox News ' request for comment . Fox News has also reached out to Twitter for comment on the lawsuit , and was told only that `` we 're not commenting at this time . '' ( The lawsuit seeks joint and several liability , which permits plaintiffs to recover from one defendant , and then leaves the defendants to sort out what each owes . )\nThe complaint also named `` Devin Nunes \u2019 Mom , '' `` a person who , with Twitter \u2019 s consent , hijacked Nunes \u2019 name , falsely impersonated Nunes \u2019 mother , and created and maintained an account on Twitter ( @ DevinNunesMom ) for the sole purpose of attacking , defaming , disparaging and demeaning Nunes . ''\nNunes lawyers ' wrote , `` In her endless barrage of tweets , Devin Nunes \u2019 Mom maliciously attacked every aspect of Nunes \u2019 character , honesty , integrity , ethics and fitness to perform his duties as a United States Congressman . ''\nOne tweet from the account , cited by the complaint , contained a crude drawing of Russian President Vladimir Putin , President Trump , and Nunes in a physically linked , symbiotic arrangement like the characters in the horror film `` The Human Centipede ( First Sequence ) . ''\nThe complaint goes to allege that the account gave factually false and defamatory information , mixed in with impermissibly `` insulting '' fighting words .\n`` Devin Nunes \u2019 Mom , '' the complaint alleges , `` stated that Nunes had turned out worse than Jacob Wohl ; falsely accused Nunes of being a racist , having 'white supremist friends ' and distributing 'disturbing inflammatory racial propaganda ' ; falsely accused Nunes of putting up a 'Fake News MAGA ' sign outside a Texas Holocaust museum ; falsely stated that Nunes would probably join the 'Proud Boys ' , if it weren \u2019 t for that unfortunate 'nomasturbating \u2019 rule ' ; disparagingly called him a 'presidential fluffer and swamp rat ' ; falsely stated that Nunes had brought 'shame ' to his family ; repeatedly accused Nunes of the crime of treason , compared him to Benedict Arnold , and called him a 'traitor . ' ''\nAs of Monday afternoon , the @ DevinNunesMom account was suspended by Twitter when Fox News tried to access it . The complaint stated that `` Twitter only suspended the account in 2019 after Nunes \u2019 real mother , Toni Dian Nunes , complained . ... Twitter permitted @ DevinNunesMom , for instance , to tweet and retweet with impunity throughout 2018 . ''\nHowever , according to the complaint , `` Twitter did nothing to investigate or review the defamation that appeared in plain view on its platform . Twitter consciously allowed the defamation of Nunes to continue '' despite reports and purported reviews by Twitter 's content moderators .\nTWITTER CEO : PLATFORM WAS PROBABLY 'WAY TOO AGGRESSIVE ' IN BANNING ACCOUNTS\n`` As part of its agenda to squelch Nunes \u2019 voice , cause him extreme pain and suffering , influence the 2018 Congressional election , and distract , intimidate and interfere with Nunes \u2019 investigation into corruption and Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election , Twitter did absolutely nothing , '' the complaint stated .\nAnother account named as a defendant was `` Devin Nunes ' Cow , '' or @ DevinCow , which purportedly called Nunes a `` treasonous cowpoke '' and an `` udder-ly worthless '' criminal .\nThe @ DevinNunesMom account also \u201c falsely stated that Nunes was unfit to run the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , and \u201c falsely stated that Nunes was \u2018 voted \u2018 Most Likely to Commit Treason \u2019 in high school , ' '' the complaint states .\nThe timing and substance of the tweets , according to Nunes ' team , suggested that Mair was working jointly with @ DevinCow and @ DevinNunesMom accounts . Mair 's LinkedIn profile , the complaint notes , contains the boast : `` What do I do for [ my ] clients ? Anonymously smear their opposition on the Internet . ''\nIn response to the lawsuit , the @ DevinCow account -- which was still active as of Monday evening -- posted numerous tweets mocking Nunes . `` I \u2019 m not quitting my day job , '' one read .\nThe complaint also charged that Twitter `` shadow-banned '' Nunes in 2018 `` in order to restrict his free speech and to amplify the abusive and hateful content published and republished by Mair , Devin Nunes \u2019 Mom , '' and other accounts . A `` shadow-banned '' user can see his or her own tweets , but others may not be able to access them easily , or at all -- making it difficult for the shadow-banned user to even realize his account is being censored .\n`` The shadow-banning was intentional , '' the complaint continued . `` It was calculated to interfere with and influence the federal election and interfere with Nunes \u2019 ongoing investigation as a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . Twitter \u2019 s actions affected the election results . The combination of the shadow-ban and Twitter \u2019 s refusal to enforce its Terms and Rules in the face of clear and present abuse and hateful conduct caused Nunes to lose support amongst voters . ''\nThe lawsuit cited numerous articles , including a Vice News story from last summer , reporting that Twitter had , for a time , downplayed the visibility of prominent conservatives in its search results . In a blog post last year , Twitter denied shadow-banning anyone based on political beliefs , and said all users ' tweets are always accessible from their profiles .\nHowever , the site did acknowledge that tweets from `` bad faith users '' would appear lower in search results , when other users attempt to look for specific terms using Twitter 's search functionality .\nOn Monday , Sean Davis , the managing editor of The Federalist , wrote that he recently had been an apparent victim of a form of shadow-banning on Twitter -- and said that contrary to Twitter 's claims , other users were unable to see a specific tweet even when they were on his profile page .\n`` Twitter gave me no notice or explanation when it shadowbanned one of my Tweets about Russian interference in our elections , '' Davis wrote . `` But what 's worse is how Twitter apparently gives its users the fraudulent impression that their tweets , which Twitter secretly bans , are still public . ''\nDavis charged that Twitter `` claimed in its e-mail to me that it 'mistakenly remove [ d ] ' a completely anodyne tweet about public congressional testimony , but did n't explain why it left the tweet -- and metrics showing no engagement -- visible to me when logged in .

''\nDorsey , the Twitter CEO , acknowledged on Joe Rogan 's podcast earlier this month that the platform has been too aggressive in banning certain accounts .\nVijaya Gadde , Twitter 's chief legal officer , said that the company would learn from its mistakes .\n`` Where we draw a line is when people use their voice and their platform to use their voice to silence someone else on the platform , '' Gadde said on the podcast . `` It \u2019 s rare for us to outright ban someone without warning .
