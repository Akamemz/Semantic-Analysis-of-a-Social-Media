    "content": "The New York Times is becoming unhinged in its hatred of Donald Trump . This morning , the paper published what may be the worst editorial that has ever graced its pages , excoriating not Trump but Jeb Bush for running a lousy campaign against Trump .\nWhat is the biggest problem with America \u2019 s political culture ? It isn \u2019 t nutty demagogues like Trump . They will always be around and will never win . It isn \u2019 t the corrupting effects of money : another piece in this morning \u2019 s Times reports that Bernie Sanders , with an average donation of $ 31.30 , is raising enough to compete on a reasonably equal basis with Hillary Clinton and her machine . From now on , candidates will have to balance the advantages of big money with the disadvantages of being known to be dependent on big money .\nNo , the biggest problem with American politics is phony umbrage : invented issues that substitute for serious debate . They allow candidates to climb onto their high horses and go nowhere important . They allow voters to avoid thinking about the choices this country needs to make . Yet they often dominate the political debate .\nA classic example is the current fuss over Jeb Bush \u2019 s use of the term \u201c anchor babies , \u201d in reference to babies born in the United States who are therefore citizens under the Constitution , even if their parents are here illegally . Some people claim to find this term offensive , but Bush \u2019 s initial , casual response to criticism was right : find me a better term and I \u2019 ll use it .\nAmong all the Republican presidential candidates , Bush unquestionably has the most generous attitude and liberal policy toward undocumented immigrants . His wife and his children are Latino . To make an issue of his use of the term \u201c anchor baby \u201d is ridiculous . For Donald Trump\u2014who says he wants to re-write the Constitution and expel 11 million people\u2014to criticize Bush for this is disgusting , but no surprise . For The New York Times to join in is mind-boggling .\nPhony umbrage almost always elicits a phony response . In defending himself to reporters on Monday , Bush claimed , obviously dishonestly , that he was referring to Asian businesses that bring pregnant women in on tourist visas . The Times admits that \u201c the phenomenon is real , \u201d but instead of criticizing Trump for phony umbrage on behalf of both Asians and Latinos , went after Bush for giving Trump the opportunity to start \u201c an unnecessary battle . \u201d\nThe Times then lectured Bush that \u201c His campaign should get better at stage-managing press events. \u201d This is preposterous . The paper was put off by , among other things , \u201c the grim , adobe-and-stucco backdrop \u201d at a press event on Monday . But for heaven \u2019 s sake , does the Times believe that candidates should be judged on the quality of the artifice in their artificial press events ? It would be nice to have a president who was terrible at \u201c stage-managing press events , \u201d wouldn \u2019 t it ?\n\u201c When he does choose to tell the truth , \u201d the Times concludes ( quite unfairly , since they have caught him in no untruth except the small and indirect one about Asian babies ) , \u201c he should find a more persuasive way to do it. \u201d Bush has said that Trump \u2019 s immigration policy would \u201c cost hundreds of billions of dollars , \u201d would \u201c violate people \u2019 s civil liberties , \u201d and would offend Mexico ( \u201c our third-largest trading partner \u201d ) . That third point is a bit boring , but the first two seem compelling enough . But the editorial maintains that people don \u2019 t really care about billions of dollars and their civil liberties , which is surprising since it seems to me that these concerns are raised , as applied to various issues , several times a week on the New York Times editorial page itself .",
