''\nAs the news broke late Monday several Republican senators applauded the move .\nSen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) told Fox host Sean Hannity that the investigation will bring accountability to the Justice Department 's 2016 campaign investigation .\n`` We need to investigate how politicized it was and in particular , we need to see what were the roles of the political appointees and who signed off on it , '' he said . `` Was it Loretta Lynch ? Was it John Brennan ? Was it Joe Biden ? Was it President Obama himself ? ''\nSen. Tom Cotton ( R-AR ) told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News that Barr `` wants to know if the spying that was done on the Trump campaign had a proper predicate , '' adding , `` I think a lot of Democrats are very worried about what that probe is going to turn up . ''\nPresident Trump nominated Durham for his current post last year and the Senate unanimously confirmed him . The two Democratic senators from Connecticut , Richard Blumenthal , and Chris Murphy , called him a `` fierce , fair prosecutor '' who knows how to try tough cases .\nKen Starr , who served as an independent counsel during the Clinton presidency , praised Barr 's choice . `` He 's totally above politics , '' said Starr , noting that the Obama administration gave Durham some key assignments , including an investigation of CIA detainees . `` We really have an honest cop on the beat now , '' said Starr .\nDurham 's appointment comes just weeks after Barr told members of Congress that he was building a team to investigate spying against the Trump campaign .\n`` I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal , '' he said . `` The generation I grew up in which was the Vietnam war , people were all concerned about spying on anti-war people by the government and there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there 's an adequate basis before our law enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance .
