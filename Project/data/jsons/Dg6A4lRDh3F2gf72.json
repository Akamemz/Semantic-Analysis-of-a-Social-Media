    "content": "Christopher Steele , the former British spy who wrote the infamous anti-Donald Trump dossier , acknowledges that a sensational charge his sources made about a tech company CEO and Democratic Party hacking is unverified .\nIn a court filing , Mr. Steele also says his accusations against the president and his aides about a supposed Russian hacking conspiracy were never supposed to be made public , much less posted in full on a website for the world to see on Jan. 10 .\nHe defends himself by saying he was betrayed by his client and that he followed proper internal channels by giving the dossier to Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , to alert the U.S. government .\nMr. Steele has not spoken publicly about his disputed opposition research project , but for the first time he is being forced to talk in a London court through his attorneys .\nBarristers for Mr. Steele and his Orbis Business Intelligence firm filed their first defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by Aleksej Gubarev , chief executive of the network solutions firm XBT Holdings .\nMr. Steele acknowledges that the part of the 35-page dossier that identified Mr. Gubarev as a rogue hacker came from \u201c unsolicited intelligence \u201d and \u201c raw intelligence \u201d that \u201c needed to be analyzed and further investigated/verified . \u201d\nDemocrats in Washington have embraced the unproven dossier as an argument for appointing a high-powered commission to investigate President Trump and his aides .\nIn his final December dossier memo \u2014 his 16th \u2014 Mr. Steele accused Mr. Gubarev and his web-hosting companies of hacking the Democratic Party computer networks with pornography and bugging devices .
