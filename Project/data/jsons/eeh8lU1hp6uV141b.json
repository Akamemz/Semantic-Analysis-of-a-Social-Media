Mary Landrieu , D-La. , a win on the Keystone Pipeline . After all , the president could have blown off the vote with an insurmountable veto , citing the need to protect executive prerogatives . So it seemed odd when the White House got coy ahead of the vote about the president \u2019 s veto threat . When the time came , though , we saw why : Team Obama had successfully whipped against the Landrieu bill . There was little chance that Landrieu was going to win her Dec. 6 runoff whatever the outcome , but with the Hail Mary turning into a Fail Mary , the seat is signed , sealed and delivered for the GOP . Democrats , led by the White House , ate one of their own rather than defy the orthodoxy of the party \u2019 s liberal base . That \u2019 s strong evidence that Democrats currently care more about ideological purity than electoral expediency . And that is always a dangerous thing .\n\u201c The president sure has changed his mind about what he can do and what he can do now . I \u2019 m just basing it on what I \u2019 ve seen other presidents in the past do. \u201d \u2013 Rep. Henry Cuellar , D-Texas , on \u201c The Kelly File. \u201d Watch here .\nFailing forward - Nowhere was this clearer than in the fact that despite having lost at least 65 seats since 2010 to reach their smallest minority since the 1920s , House Democrats gave Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , a seventh term as their leader . It has oft been mentioned that Pelosi is now second only to Sam Rayburn for her longevity as a party leader in the House . Less mentioned is that while Rayburn spent only four of his 21 years in the minority , Pelosi will have spent only four of her 14 years in the majority . Yes , this is partly about a dearth of young talent among Democrats , but it is more about liberal orthodoxy . Pelosi has been an uncharacteristically ideological party leader \u2013 consider her forcing Democrats to walk the plank on global warming fees in 2010 \u2013 and her members like it that way . Asked by Politico why she stayed , Pelosi chalked it up to ObamaCare : \u201c I \u2019 m honestly here to protect the Affordable Care Act. \u201d Gulp . Not exactly a cheery sentiment for Democrats looking to run as centrist reformers in 2016 .\n[ White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Senate Democrats are scheduled to meet Thursday about a variety of issues , immigration key among them . ]\n\u2018 Big \u2019 loser - But the juice this week is really about immigration and the president \u2019 s preparation for the most audacious use of pen power yet . The White House disseminated talking points to immigration activists on Tuesday as part of some expectations setting , but mainly to get every Democrat to repeat , in unison , that previous presidents have exempted specific groups from deportation in the past . This move is different in scope and in nature , since the group reportedly will be defined by its status in the U.S. \u2013 parents of children here legally \u2013 as compared to prior exemptions , mostly for groups of refugees or immigrants from specific nations or regions . Soon-to-be Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , who , like Pelosi , breezed back into his leadership spot despite a hideous election performance has got his pom-poms ready . . \u201c I believe that whatever the president decides to do on his executive order , he should go big \u2014 as big as he can \u2026 \u201d Reid enthused .\n[ In a WSJ Op-Ed , Rep. Bob Goodlatte , R-Va. , says President Obama is turning a deaf ear to the people with his planned unilateral edict on immigration and Congress will use all of its constitutional powers to stop him . ]\nVanishing point - An audacious , confrontational approach to the midterm defeat is very much in vogue among Democrats , especially liberal firebrands who believe that a more concentrated version of the party \u2019 s ideology would have given more reason for inert coalition members to get to the polls . What the president heard from the two thirds of adults who did not vote was that they wanted more , more , more of his agenda . He started with global warming last week , but in the coming days will turn to immigration . As recent polling has shown , that won \u2019 t go over very well . Democrats may blame their inability to motivate their base for a painful midterm cycle , but anything seen as \u201c big \u201d could be very dangerous for a party that is approaching the vanishing point with the blue-collar white voters that once formed its core .\n[ Roll Call : \u201c Sen . Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) doesn \u2019 t know if his effort to push off the debate on funding the government into next year will prove successful , but the Texas Republican is sure making an effort\u2026 \u201c I think a long-term omnibus or CR makes no sense .

The Ready for Warren Super PAC will soon be dumping 100,000 letters , postcards and petition signatures on the desk of their heroine , Sen. Elizabeth Warren . They have also released their first official video which hopes to build momentum for a presidential run , saying in part , \u201c We think it \u2019 s time to elect a leader who is fearless , honest , and progressive. \u201d That is , they mean to say , not the former first lady of Arkansas . Clinton \u2019 s massive money and huge organization seems impossible to beat , especially since Warren shows little stomach for a fight . But the rebels are out there , hoping against hope that Obama \u2019 s presidency really did move the party to the left and wasn \u2019 t just a fast-vanishing Clinton interregnum .\n[ Erica Sagrans , campaign manager for Ready for Warren , explains to the WaPo why Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) is already influencing Hillary Clinton \u2019 s candidacy . ]\nThe coming conflict - Hillary , meanwhile is selling something very different : Moderation and an appeal to voters in states written off by Democrats since 2000 . Mitch Stewart , who is a strategist for the Clintons \u2019 still-unofficial campaign , explained to Talking Points Memo that with her ability to reach out to \u201c white , working-class voters , \u201d lost to Obama and the party for more than a decade , Hillary can put states like Indiana , Georgia and Arkansas in play . How to do that ? As the failings of Clinton-core candidates in 2014 demonstrated , proximity to husband Bill is not enough to bring back the 1992 coalition . So how would Hillary bring them home ? By being moderate in the mold of the Big Dog himself . And guess what doesn \u2019 t fit with that : Aggressive global warming action , a nuclear deal with Iran , a last-man-standing defense of ObamaCare and , maybe most of all , large-scale , temporary amnesty by presidential fiat .
