    "content": "Why The Russia Investigation Matters And Why You Should Care\nA lot of people wonder why there is such a focus on the Russia investigations , what Trump 's campaign did ( or did n't do ) and whether there was obstruction of justice .\nBelow , we laid out the case for why you should care about those items .\nAnd in his testimony before the Senate intelligence committee on June 8 former FBI Director James Comey added his voice again with this observation :\n`` The reason this is such a big deal . We have this big messy wonderful country where we fight with each other all the time . But nobody tells us what to think , what to fight about , what to vote for except other Americans . And that 's wonderful and often painful . But we 're talking about a foreign government that using technical intrusion , lots of other methods tried to shape the way we think , we vote , we act . That is a big deal . And people need to recognize it . It 's not about Republicans or Democrats . They 're coming after America , which I hope we all love equally . They want to undermine our credibility in the face the world . They think that this great experiment of ours is a threat to them . So they 're going to try to run it down and dirty it up as much as possible . That 's what this is about and they will be back . Because we remain \u2014 as difficult as we can be with each other , we remain that shining city on the hill . And they do n't like it . ''\nOn Wednesday , the underlying actual thing you should care about is getting discussed on Capitol Hill \u2014 some of what Russia actually did to meddle in the election and how the U.S. can try to avoid it in the future .\nThis issue has gotten so steeped in politics , that it 's been hard for some in Congress , particularly Republicans , to see the bigger picture .\nThe marquee testimony will come from Jeh Johnson , the former Homeland Security secretary under President Obama . He testifies before the House intelligence committee . Also on Wednesday , the Senate intelligence committee hears from outside experts on what exactly they found Russia did .\nHere 's the original version of this story , which ran May 24 :\nSome people have FOMO that they might miss an Orlando Bloom waitress update .\nOthers have a fear of missing out when it comes to the latest on whether Michael Flynn is going to turn over documents that have been requested by Congress \u2014 and what 's going to happen next in the Russia investigation .\nYour author is in the latter category \u2014 and does n't really know how much people care about Orlando Bloom and his waitryst ( see what we did there ? ) , but it was a trending Google search .\nThere is a divide in this country \u2014 and it 's not the one between Democrats and Republicans . It 's the one between people who are deeply captivated by politics and those more engaged with other priorities and `` real '' lives .\nAt NPR , it 's our goal to try and bridge that divide the best we can \u2014 to make the complicated understandable and relatable , and especially to tell you why something in politics matters .\nThat 's why a question asked at Tuesday 's House intelligence committee hearing about the Russia investigation with former Obama CIA Director John Brennan caught our attention :\n`` Please tell my constituents , my neighbors , why they should care \u2014 and not just in Washington , D.C. , but in Washington state and Texas and Connecticut and points in between \u2014 and why should they care , and why do you care , sir ? ''\nThe question was posed by Washington Democrat Denny Heck , and it provoked a high-minded response .\n`` Well , for the last 241 years , the nation and the citizens have cherished the freedom and liberty upon which this country was founded upon . Many brave Americans have lost their lives to protect that freedom and liberty and lost their lives to protect the freedom and liberties of other peoples around the world . Our ability to choose our elected leaders , as we see fit , is , I believe , an inalienable right that we must protect with all of the resources and authority and power . `` And the fact that the Russians tried to influence resources and authority and power , and the fact that the Russians tried to influence that election so that the will of the American people was not going to be realized by that election , I find outrageous and something that we need to , with every last ounce of devotion to this country , resist and try to act to prevent further instances of that . And so , therefore , I believe , this is something that 's critically important to every American . Certainly , it 's very important for me , for my children and grandchildren to make sure that never again will a foreign country try to influence and interfere in the foundation stone of this country , which is electing our democratic leaders . ''\nRussia is accused , as Brennan said , of not only trying to influence the election by hacking and releasing emails , but engaging in a full-fledged influence campaign through propaganda to get Donald Trump elected . That 's the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community . Not only that , but the FBI is investigating potential collusion between Trump associates and Russia to help in that effort \u2014 in Russia 's interest .\nTrump 's former national security adviser , Flynn , is at the center of all of it . Others , including Trump 's former campaign manager for a time , Paul Manafort ; Carter Page , a former foreign policy adviser ; and , the Washington Post reported , a senior adviser currently in the Trump White House , also are being investigated for their ties .\nJared Kushner , Trump 's son-in-law and a top adviser , also was found to have met with the head of a Russian state-owned bank and to have communicated with Russian officials . He has offered to speak with the Senate intelligence committee .\nJames Comey was fired as FBI director after testifying twice in the past few months on the FBI 's investigation . Wednesday is the deadline set by House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz for the FBI to turn over any Comey memos related to the Russia investigation ( though it 's unclear the Justice Department will allow them to be sent over ) .\nIt turns out , Heck also asked Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers , the director of the National Security Agency and head of U.S. Cyber Command , the very same question at a hearing back in March .\n`` I do n't think it 's in the best interest of our nation for any external entity to attempt to manipulate outcomes , to shape choices . That should be the inherent role of a democracy . The investigation we 're going through , I think , is a positive in the sense it 'll help illuminate to all of us , regardless of party , what are the implications here and what does it mean for us , because I think our conclusion , and that of the intelligence community broadly here , is this \u2014 absent some change , this behavior is not likely to stop .

Rogers , I truly believe we are a shining city on a hill to quote a great American , and one of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful , often messy , but free and fair democratic system and the elections that undergird it . And so , when there 's an effort by a foreign nation-state to mess with that , to destroy that , to corrupt that , it 's very , very serious \u2014 threatens what is America . And if any Americans are part of that effort , it 's a very serious matter . And so you would expect the FBI to want to understand \u2014 is that so ? And , if so , who did what ? `` But , again , I want to be very careful , so that people do n't overinterpret my words , to preserve our ability to answer those questions , we 're not talking about our work .

I would rather not be talking about this at all , but we thought it was important to share at least that much [ that there is an FBI investigation into Trump team connections to Russia ] with the committee and the American people , and now we 're going to close our mouths and do our work to see if we can answer those questions 'cause the answers matter .
