Rashida Tlaib , D-Mich. , and Ilhan Omar , D-Minn. , from entering the country as part of a planned visit , a reversal that comes amid pressure from President Trump and concerns about their support for boycotts of Israel .\nThe move prompted a massive outcry from Democratic lawmakers in Washington , with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calling it a `` sign of weakness '' and Omar accusing Israel of implementing `` Trump \u2019 s Muslim ban . ''\nHOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY OKS RESOLUTION OPPOSING ISRAEL BOYCOTT IN RARE BIPARTISAN VOTE\n`` It is an affront that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu , under pressure from President Trump , would deny entry to representatives of the U.S. government , '' Omar said in a statement .\nBut the Israeli government staunchly defended the decision -- suggesting the lawmakers had ulterior motives with the planned trip .\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , explaining the decision at length on his office 's Twitter account , said that Tlaib and Omar 's itinerary `` revealed that they planned a visit whose sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel 's legitimacy . ''\nNetanyahu said their travel plans referred to a trip to `` Palestine , '' not Israel , and the congresswomen were not interested in meeting with Israeli officials . He went on to note that the Palestinian organization that planned the visit , MIFTAH , supports the boycott movement , and that people associated with the group have supported terror against Israel in the past .\nHe said Israel welcomes critics with the exception of those who support boycotts of the Jewish State .\nThe decision itself was made by Interior Minister Arye Deri and announced earlier Thursday by deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely , despite prior assurances that the congresswomen would be allowed in .\n`` Israel has decided \u2014 we won \u2019 t enable the members of Congress to enter the country , \u201d Hotovely told public broadcaster Kan. `` We won \u2019 t allow those who deny our right to exist in this world to enter Israel .

''\nNetanyahu confirmed that Deri would consider permitting Tlaib to visit her Palestinian family members if she filed a humanitarian request and promised not to promote boycotts of Israel while she visits .\nTrump cheered the decision , tweeting : `` Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party , and they HATE Israel ! '' This , after he publicly pressured Israel to stand firm in blocking Omar and Tlaib amid earlier reports that the government was considering doing so .\n`` It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit , '' Trump tweeted Thursday morning . `` They hate Israel & all Jewish people , & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds . Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office . They are a disgrace !
