Marco Rubio \u2019 s splashy presidential-campaign announcement and his subsequent media blitz has likely helped him catch up with friend and former mentor Jeb Bush in their home state of Florida , according to a new poll of 400 registered Republican voters . Rubio garnered 31 percent support from Republicans and essentially tied Bush \u2019 s 30 percent , according to a Mason-Dixon Polling & Research survey conducted Tuesday through Thursday and shared exclusively with POLITICO . The other likely and announced presidential candidates polled in the single digits and 17 percent were undecided .\nRubio \u2019 s slight edge is statistically insignificant , in part , because it falls easily within the margin of error . But the poll is instructive nonetheless .\nOne of the greatest and most pressing concerns for Rubio before taking the plunge , I assume , was whether or not he could secure enough donors and supporters to lock up his home state\u2014a state that he just so happens to share with establishment juggernaut Jeb Bush . If he ca n't win Florida , so the argument goes , he might as well sit this one out . So , of course , the skeptics urged Rubio stay in the Senate , defer to his mentor , and keep quiet presumably because Bush is unbeatable in Florida , and thus launching a presidential campaign undercutting him would inevitably go down in flames .\n\u201c I 've heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn , \u201d Rubio said earlier this week when announcing his presidential bid . \u201c But I can not .
