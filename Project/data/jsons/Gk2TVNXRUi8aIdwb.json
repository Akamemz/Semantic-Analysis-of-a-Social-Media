    "content": "The surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings was charged Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill three people and wound more than 200 in what FBI investigators said evidence shows was a coldly calculated attack .\nWith chilling detail , the criminal complaint filed against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev says he was seen on video placing a bag near the the finish line of the marathon , watching and reacting with no surprise as the first explosion went off down the street , and then `` calmly but rapidly '' walking away before the second blast occurred at the spot where moments before he had been standing . ( Scroll down to see more from the complaint or to read a complete copy of it . )\nThe FBI 's description of that scene came just before people in Boston and across Massachusetts were to pause for a moment of silence at 2:50 p.m . ET Monday \u2014 marking the time exactly one week ago when the first of the two bombs exploded . The criminal complaint filed against Tsarnaev also included a new detail : Previously , officials had said 170 to 180 people were injured in the blasts . In the complaint , they increased that to `` over 200 . ''\nLatest Developments \u2014 Surviving suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will not be considered an `` enemy combatant , '' the White House says . That means he will be treated and tried as a criminal defendant . \u2014 Tsarnaev , who remains in serious condition at a Boston hospital , was arraigned in his bed . He 's charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill three people and injure more than 200 ( a higher number of injured than had previously been reported ) . \u2014 According to a transcript \u2014 obtained by The New York Times \u2014 of today 's initial appearance before United States Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler , Tsarnaev said one word \u2014 `` No '' \u2014 when he was asked if he could afford a lawyer . At the end of the hearing \u2014 where Tsarnaev was given his Miranda warning \u2014 Bowler said she found `` the defendant is alert , mentally competent , and lucid . He is aware of the nature of the proceedings . '' \u2014 The investigation continues into whether anyone besides Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan ( who died Friday after a gun battle with police ) may have been involved in the Boston Marathon bombings . \u2014 There was a funeral Monday for Krystle Campbell , one of the three people killed in the marathon bombings .\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev , 19 , was arraigned at Boston 's Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital , where he remains in serious condition . As NPR 's David Schaper reported on Morning Edition , it 's not clear yet how or when Tsarnaev was wounded or who inflicted some of his injuries . It 's possible he tried to kill himself . Sources familiar with the investigation into the bombings have told NPR that wounds to his neck and jaw area are preventing Tsarnaev from talking .\nAccording to a transcript of today 's initial appearance before United States Magistrate Judge Marianne B.

He was discovered in a boat stored in a Watertown family 's backyard .

He is aware of the nature of the proceedings . ''\nWilliam Fick , the federal defender representing Tsarnaev , also agreed to a voluntary detention of the suspect .\nFor about seven minutes beginning at 2:50 p.m .

ET . Details From The Complaint Against Tsarnaev .\nDaniel Genck , an FBI special agent , writes in the criminal complaint that :\n-- On video , a man who appears to be Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can be seen placing a bag down in front of the Forum Restaurant along the marathon route . `` Approximately 30 seconds before the first explosion , he lifts [ a ] phone to his ear as if he is speaking ... and keeps it there for approximately 18 seconds . A few seconds after he finishes the call , the large crowd of people around him can be seen reacting to the first explosion . Virtually every head turns to the east ( toward the finish line ) and stares in that direction in apparent bewilderment and alarm . Bomber Two [ Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ] , virtually alone among the individuals in front of the restaurant appears calm . He glances to east and then calmly but rapidly begins moving to the west , away from the direction of the finish line . He walks away without his knapsack , having left it on the ground where he had been standing . Approximately 10 seconds later , an explosion occurs in the location where Bomber Two had placed his knapsack . ''\n-- The victim of a carjacking Thursday night in Cambridge , Mass. , has told police that one of the two men ( who the agent later identifies as Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev ) said during the carjacking : `` Did you hear about the Boston explosion ? ... I did that . ''\n-- `` A preliminary examination of the explosive devices that were discovered at the scene of the shootout in Watertown [ early Friday ] and in the abandoned vehicle has revealed similarities to the explosives used at the Boston Marathon .
