Their ranks grew as they inched north and , along with them , falsehoods grew , too . But one stands out : a conspiracy theory that liberal billionaire George Soros , a Jewish immigrant , is paying the migrants to make the journey \u2013 or even orchestrating it .\nMembers of Congress and the president \u2019 s son both repeated it . Conservative celebrities , too .\nIt also may have resonated in darker places . Cesar Sayoc , the man charged with mailing pipe bombs to Soros and other prominent critics of President Donald Trump , dwelled at length online about conspiracy theories involving the Hungarian-American philanthropist . Robert Bowers , charged with killing 11 people worshiping in a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday , used his social media accounts to post extensively about the caravan , including circulating an image of refugees in Guatemala purportedly climbing into a truck with a Star of David on the side .\nBut it began with a handful of posts in the caravan \u2019 s early days .\nOne of the first was from a North Carolina writer who goes by the screen name \u201c lorettatheprole. \u201d Loretta Malakie has more than 6,000 followers on Twitter , to whom she directs frequent posts about \u201c white genocide , \u201d Jews and the \u201c invading force \u201d approaching the border .\nOn Oct. 14 , Malakie posted a link to an article about the caravan , with a single word of commentary : \u201c Soros . \u201d\nThat same day , identical posts appeared over the course of 20 minutes in six pro-Trump Facebook groups . Combined , those six groups had 165,000 members . A user who gave the name Philip Balzano , a Trump supporter from Chicago , wrote to the Trump Train group : \u201c Here Comes ANOTHER Group of Paid for New Demoncratic Voters Just in Time for the Primaries ... The Financier aka \u2018 Win at All Costs \u2019 \u2018 Never Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste \u2019 the Evil George Soros and His 140+ Orgs , Should Be Classified as Terrorist and Terrorist Orgs . \u201d\nMalakie declined to comment , though on Twitter she panned the \u2588\u2588\u2588 reporter who called her as \u201c evil. \u201d Balzano did not respond to an interview request sent through Facebook .\nThe Soros theory was not new \u2013 it had made the rounds during previous caravans in the spring and again in August . In fact , one Facebook user posting in October provided as evidence a video of Glenn Beck discussing the spring caravan \u2019 s alleged connections to Soros .\nThis time , though , the theory snowballed , gaining political purchase as the caravan became a flashpoint in the final weeks of a contentious midterm campaign .\n\u201c It \u2019 s really significant how these memes can go from feverswamp-ish places to be amplified by lawmakers , even the president , '' said David Carroll , associate professor at The New School 's Parsons School of Design in New York . \u201c From there , the impact on world events can \u2019 t be underestimated . \u201d\nLies , of course , are not new either . But social media can turn a breeze into a hurricane . It carried this falsehood to millions with a few taps on a screen . It also left a distinct trail that makes it possible to follow how lies spread and who told them , a map of their trajectory from the darker corners of the internet to the political mainstream .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 followed that path by examining tens of thousands of social media posts on three major mainstream social media sites : Twitter , Facebook and Reddit .\nOver the next three days , a few louder social media voices weighed in . By Oct. 16 \u2013 four days after the caravan departed \u2013 the combined following of accounts mentioning both Soros and the caravan had reached 2 million , still a pebble in the flood tide of social media . ( The total includes some duplicates because people follow more than one account . )\nOn Twitter , someone with the username \u201c LibertyBell1000 \u201d warned about 42,000 followers that Soros had \u201c manufactured yet another immigrant caravan \u2018 crisis. \u2019 \u201d Another , using the name \u201c WhoWolfe , \u201d asked \u201c Anybody else think Soros and the Dirty Dems are behind this ? \u201d\nMore posts spread across Facebook . Trump supporter Randy Penrod posted in a group called \u201c The Deplorable 's , \u201d with about 186,000 members , \u201c Our stable leader just called out the Soros conspired invasion of new Democrat voters in a tweet just moments ago . \u201d\nIt took just one more day for the theory to reach critical mass , breaking through into widespread public consciousness .\nThe evening of Oct. 17 , a Republican member of Congress posted a video on Twitter of what he said was people in Honduras handing out small sums of money to migrants .\n\u201c Soros ?
