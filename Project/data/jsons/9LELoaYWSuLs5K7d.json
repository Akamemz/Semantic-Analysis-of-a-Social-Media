But some of you are extraordinary . The crap you think of is unbelievable . \u201d\nThe White House did not invite the big social media companies to its event on purported bias against conservatives . There was no constructive conversation around the many and varied problems of social media to be had on Thursday .

Here 's who 's coming .\nWith a captive audience crammed into the East Room of the White House , the president took the opportunity to bash tech companies , highlight his poll numbers , personally commend Project Veritas provocateur James O \u2019 Keefe , mistakenly say that Arnold Schwarzenegger is dead while referencing a canceled TV show , and \u2014 like any good Twitter user \u2014 complain that he \u2019 s not getting retweets like he used to .\n\u201c When I put out something , a good one that people like , right ? A good tweet . It goes up , \u201d Trump said . \u201c It used to go up , it would say : 7,000 ; 7,008 ; 7,017 ; 7,024 ; 7,032 ; 7,044 . Right ? Now it goes : 7,000 ; 7,008 ; 6,998 .
