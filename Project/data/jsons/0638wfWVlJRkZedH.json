But the Republican , who has battled with teachers unions during his time as state House speaker in Raleigh , has been attacked anew by their ads in the Senate race .\nAt a recent debate , Tillis rejected ads that accuse him of pushing budget cuts that hurt students .\n`` It 's simply false . Since 2011 we 're spending a billion dollars a year more on education , '' he said . `` This year , we provided an average 7 percent pay increase for teachers .
