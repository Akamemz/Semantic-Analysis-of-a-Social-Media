Titled \u201c Blessing , \u201d the commercial is aimed directly at evangelical and social conservative voters in early voting states , timed for Easter weekend and slated to air during popular Christian-themed programming .\nIt \u2019 s an exercise in narrowcasting that telegraphs exactly how Cruz intends to win the GOP nomination against better-funded and better-known rivals .
