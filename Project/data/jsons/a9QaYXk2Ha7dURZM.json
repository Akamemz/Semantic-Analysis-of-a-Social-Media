Mitt Romney was the victor over President Barack Obama in the first of three debates marking the last month of the 2012 campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe debate was relatively sleepy, and there were no fireworks or big \u201cmoments\u201d to speak of, but Romney scored on points against a barely-there incumbent.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Romney\u2019s 5 best debate lines)\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear the Denver debate will be the \u201cgame-changer\u201d that some of Romney\u2019s supporters predicted in its immediate aftermath, but Obama adviser David Axelrod set the expectations in the spin room when he indicated he expects the Republican will get a bounce off his performance.\n\nWhat Romney definitely did was earn himself a second look from the slim pool of undecided and persuadable voters still considering their options, and give himself a tighter messaging framework to use, if he is able to, before the next debate in New York two weeks from now.\n\nBelow, POLITICO\u2019s five takeaways:\n\n1. The Newt-slayer is back.\n\nThe Romney on stage Wednesday night bore a much closer resemblance to the one who ground up Newt Gingrich in the Florida GOP primary debate when his campaign depended on it.\n\nRomney was aggressive, knew his points, and pushed back whenever there was an opportunity. He more than passed the test of being able to stand on the same platform as the president of the United States.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Mitt Romney wins a reprieve)\n\nRomney didn\u2019t make any sweeping new vision statements. But he was sharp and able to rattle off statistics with ease. He stayed focused on the president and, unlike Obama, seemed mindful of the camera being on him even when it wasn\u2019t his turn to speak. His response on Obama\u2019s health-care plan was about the way it was enacted, as opposed to a muddled explanation of his own health plan as governor of Massachusetts. And he did not let Obama score a point off him without firing back.\n\nRomney wasn\u2019t perfect \u2014 a quip about Big Bird that landed like a lead feather, and he had a tendency to get a bit bogged down in the weeds of tax plans and statistics during the debate\u2019s key first half hour, possibly because he was a bit overprepared.\n\n( PHOTOS: Scenes from Denver debate)\n\nThere were no knockout punches either, but a thousand cuts that made Obama bleed.\n\n2. Obama has a lot of work do.\n\nPost-debate, the president\u2019s campaign was spinning valiantly in the media filing center. But there was no mistake among Democratic operatives here and in other states that Obama blew it.\n\nIt was one of the weakest performances ever turned in by a man known for his oratorical skill in speeches, and well enough (if less consistently solidly) in debates. Obama looked like he just wasn\u2019t enjoying himself. He gave halting answers, and seemed exhausted and irritable at times. He nodded frequently when Romney talked, dismissively saying \u201cokay\u201d while the former governor was midway through a response at one point.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Not debatable: Obama stumbled)\n\nThe president came alive a bit at the end, using his line about Romney as \u201cextreme,\u201d but it was rather late, and by then impressions had formed.\n\nObama and his campaign team may actually feel otherwise, but for 90 minutes, Obama\u2019s body language and approach also signaled that he doesn\u2019t consider beating Romney a huge challenge. The president seemed to be playing things safe. If so, that\u2019s a problem because the race remains close and there is a month \u2014 and two debates \u2014 left.",
