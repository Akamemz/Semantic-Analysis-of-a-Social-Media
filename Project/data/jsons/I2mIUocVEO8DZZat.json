The accusations are \u201c an assault on his being , \u201d said David Axelrod , his chief strategist \u2014 not to mention a discomfiting twist in a re-election fight in which the turnout of black voters , who express overwhelming loyalty to the president but also some disappointment , could sway the result .\nBut like an actor originating a role on Broadway , Mr. Obama has been performing a part that no one else has ever played , and close observers say they can see him becoming as assured on race in public as he is in private conversation . In 2009 , the new president \u2019 s statement on the arrest of a black Harvard professor by a white police officer set off days of negative headlines ; in 2012 , he gave a commanding but tender lament over the killing of a black teenager , Trayvon Martin , by a white man .\n\u201c As he \u2019 s gotten more comfortable being president , he \u2019 s gotten more comfortable being him , \u201d said Brian Mathis , an Obama fund-raiser .\nAsked when they could sense that shift , several advisers and friends mentioned the waning hours of Mr. Obama \u2019 s birthday party in the summer of 2011 . As the hour grew late , many of the white guests left , and the music grew \u201c blacker and blacker , \u201d as the comedian Chris Rock later told an audience . Watching African-American entertainers and sports stars do the Dougie to celebrate a black president in a house built by slaves , Mr. Rock said , \u201c I felt like I died and went to black heaven . \u201d\nThe president , guests recalled , seemed free of calibration or inhibition . He danced with relative abandon , other guests ribbing him about his moves , everyone swaying to Stevie Wonder under a portrait of George Washington .\nIn the White House , Mr. Obama has relied on a long-term strategy on race and politics that he has been refining throughout his career .\nAs far back as 1995 , former colleagues at the University of Chicago remember him talking about moving away from the old politics of grievance and using common economic interests to bind diverse coalitions . \u201c He argued that if political action and political speeches are tailored solely to white audiences , minorities will withdraw , just as whites often recoil when political action and speeches are targeted to racial minority audiences , \u201d recalled William Julius Wilson , now a sociologist at Harvard .\nMr. Wilson had turned the world of social policy on its head by arguing that class was becoming more determinative than race in America and pointing out that race-specific remedies were less politically feasible than economic policies that benefited a broad range of people . The young politician absorbed Mr. Wilson \u2019 s ideas , which matched his own experience as a community organizer and a person whose own life did not fit neat racial categories .\nMr. Obama now presides over a White House that constantly projects cross-racial unity . When discussing in interviews what image the Obamas want to project , aides use one word more than any other : \u201c inclusive. \u201d Concerts of Motown and civil-rights-era songs have been stocked with musicians of many races , and in introducing them , the president emphasizes how the melodies brought disparate Americans together . Though the Memphis sanitation workers were involved in a shattering moment of the civil rights struggle \u2014 Dr. King was assassinated after going to support their strike \u2014 they were invited to the White House for a labor event , not a race-oriented one .\nMany of the president \u2019 s most critical domestic policy decisions have disproportionately benefited African-Americans : stimulus money that kept public sector workers employed , education grants to help underperforming schools and a health care overhaul that will cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans . But he invariably frames those as policies intended to help Americans of all backgrounds .\n\u201c If you really want to get something done , you can \u2019 t put it in a way that will kill it before it gets going , \u201d Mr. Obama said in one meeting , according to the Rev . Al Sharpton . \u201c We have to deal with the specific problems of different groups \u2014 blacks , women , gays and lesbians , immigrants \u2014 in a way that doesn \u2019 t allow people to put these wedges in , \u201d Mr. Sharpton recalled the president saying in another .\nThat approach , along with the memories of the toxic campaign battles over Mr. Obama \u2019 s former pastor , the Rev . Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , has resulted in a White House that often appears to tiptoe around race .\nDebra Lee , the chairman and chief executive of Black Entertainment Television , requested interviews with the Obamas in 2009 , but press aides told her that they did not want the first couple on BET in the first six months of the administration , she said in an interview . ( They appeared later . )\n\u201c There was all this caution and concern because we were in the midst of a great American experiment , \u201d one former aide said . Another aide remembered palpable nervousness about the artwork the Obamas chose for their private quarters in the White House , including some with race-specific messages .\nIn private , White House aides frequently dissect the racial dynamics of the presidency , asking whether Representative Joe Wilson , Republican of South Carolina , would have yelled \u201c You lie ! \u201d at a white president during an address to Congress or what Tea Party posters saying \u201c Take Back Our Country \u201d really mean .
