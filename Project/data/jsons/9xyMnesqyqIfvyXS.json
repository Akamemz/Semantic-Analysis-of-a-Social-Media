I would ask for their cooperation and understanding and remember what we are trying to balance . We are trying to balance aid to West Africa and protection and the public health of New Yorkers and addressing the fear and concern of New Yorkers . We have spoken many times about the reality of Ebola . It is not an especially new disease . It was discovered in 1976 . It is not like the flu . It is not easily caught . All the evidence says that it is transmitted through bodily fluids once the person is infected and highly contagious . So , there is no cause for general alarm but again we want the people of New York to know we are staying one step ahead . We are doing everything possible . Some people will say we are being too cautious . I will take that criticism because that is better than the alternative . As Governor of New York , my number one job is to protect the people of New York and this does that. \u201d WHITE FLASH 3 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( English ) NEW YORK STATE GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAYING : \u201c From an operational , efficiency point of view and from a safety point of view , the preferred option is to ask them to stay home . The health care worker will come to their house twice a day , they can have their family , whoever is normally there , it is not that they are stopping their life . They have their full life . But , if they become symptomatic , you will have limited the number of people they will have been in contact with. \u201d WHITE FLASH 4 . ( SOUNDBITE ) ( English ) NEW YORK STATE GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAYING : \u201c Well , the White House first of all and CDC will establish a protocol . They are yet to establish their protocol for this situation and we have to operate now . Right , we live in the here and now . Number two , whatever the CDC comes up with , they will be the first to say , I believe , that they understand states have different needs and what New York needs , is different than what Nebraska may need , is different than what Kansas may need , is different than what Florida may need . So , CDC will come up with general operating protocols , but the states are free to design their own protocols . If there is a region in the country that has more differences than New York , New Jersey , I don \u2019 t know of one . But , this will be consistent . It will probably be somewhat safer than what CDC comes up with once they come up with their definitive protocol . But , I will take that criticism if you want to call it a criticism that I want to be safer than CDC says , fine . \u201d",
