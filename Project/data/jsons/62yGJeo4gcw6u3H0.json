Over 33 million people , from England , Scotland , Wales , Northern Ireland and Gibraltar , have all had their say .

We not only have a parliamentary democracy , but on questions about the arrangements for how we are governed there are times when it is right to ask the people themselves and that is what we have done . The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected . I want to thank everyone who took part in the campaign on my side of the argument , including all those who put aside party differences to speak in what they believe was the national interest and let me congratulate all those who took part in the Leave campaign for the spirited and passionate case that they made . The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered .

I held nothing back , I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger , safer and better off inside the European Union . And I made clear the Referendum was about this and this alone - not the future of any single politician including myself . But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction .

This is not a decision I \u2019 ve taken lightly but I do believe it \u2019 s in the national interest to have a period of stability and then the new leadership required . There is no need for a precise timetable today but in my view we should aim to have a new prime minister in place by the start of the Conservative Party conference in October .
