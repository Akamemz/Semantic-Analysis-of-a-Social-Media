What the canal advocates had in mind was shipping manufactures to the interior and bringing agricultural commodities out for export .

New York traders had for years played second fiddle to their Philadelphian counterparts even though New York was the larger city . But the opening of the canal in 1825 changed that , and New York \u2019 s emergence as a center of finance in addition to a center of trade in goods was accelerated by another product of the early 19th century : Samuel Morse \u2019 s telegraph , developed with the support of a $ 30,000 grant from Congress used to build a test line between Baltimore and Washington .
