These were people like her mother and Ms. Salas \u2019 aunts and uncles .\nAs a 15-year-old going to school in Pasadena , and the only family member who knew how to type , she had filled in their amnesty forms . Now it was time for the next step . Chirla advertised workshops on citizenry on the radio , urged family and friends to become citizens , and set up voter registration tables outside swearing-in ceremonies for new citizens .\nThe group also worked with the county registrar to enable voter registration inside these ceremonies , which sometimes served more than 2,000 new citizens at a sitting . It was no coincidence that these newly minted citizens and subsequent Latino voters vastly favored Democrats over Republicans . Before Governor Wilson backed Proposition 187 , Latino voter registration only slightly favored Democrats , says Dr. Romero , an expert on Latino voting patterns .\nToday , close to 60 % of registered Latino voters in California are Democrats , she says , and most unaffiliated Latinos vote the same way . Latino registration with Republicans is in the low teens . At 40 % of the population , Latinos are California \u2019 s largest , and fastest growing , ethnic group .\nDamian Dovarganes/AP/File Richard Avina ( center ) assists Judith Ceja with finding her voting place in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles .\nLegislators , too , systematically built their caucus . It began in 1973 with five members . They were too small to influence legislation , but they built important political bridges , including one to Democratic Speaker Willie Brown . In 1981 , he named one of their members to chair a redistricting committee , which then drew new districts favorable to Latinos .\nThese early efforts helped pave the way for much greater Latino representation in the 1990s . But it did not happen organically . Richard Polanco , former state legislator and Senate majority leader from East Los Angeles , is widely credited as the architect of today \u2019 s powerful Latino caucus .\nMr. Polanco says that Proposition 187 , redistricting , and term limits \u2013 which opened up seats \u2013 were all important factors in building the caucus . But it also required a strategic approach and caucus discipline .\nHe and others identified recruits , and assisted them with financial resources and campaign management . In exchange , the recruits were asked to help raise funds and walk and talk with voters . \u201c Nothing else mattered , \u201d Mr. Polanco recalls .\nHe also broke an unspoken rule of not putting up candidates against a Democratic incumbent or someone backed by the party .\n\u201c We communicated to the speaker , \u2018 With all due respect , we \u2019 ll do what we can to support the Democratic caucus , but we \u2019 re going to engage. \u2019 And we did . \u201d\nBetween 1991 and 2002 , the caucus grew from seven members to 22 , a surge that vastly increased Latino leverage in the Legislature . A series of Latino speakers , wielding power over the agenda , ensued . Latinos took on key committee chairmanships and pushed groundbreaking legislation .\nRich Pedroncelli/AP/File \u201c Latinos changed the political structure. \u201d \u2013 Richard Polanco , former California Senate majority leader\nOf her many bills , one that Ms. Gonzalez is proudest of is mandatory sick days for part- and full-time workers in the private sector . Back in 2014 , more than 6 million Californians could not get a paid day off for ill health . After the law took effect a year later , people would come up to her and show off their pay stubs , pointing out that they had earned sick days .\n\u201c I remember a worker from McDonald \u2019 s showing me , and he was so proud and just so excited , \u201d she says .\nIt \u2019 s an example of the broader laws pushed by Latino legislators that intersect with the interests of their community , but don \u2019 t focus on them exclusively . It \u2019 s also an example of the national ripple effect that such laws can have and how they shape the Democratic agenda .\nAt least eight other states have adopted paid sick leave since California became an early adopter . A similar number have also opted to ban single-use plastic bags , while restaurants across the nation now list calorie counts on their menus . Both were California firsts \u2013 and both were authored by Secretary of State Padilla when he was in the Senate .\nMs. Gonzalez , a high-energy lawmaker with a laser focus on working-class issues , has become a state lawmaker to watch .\nShe has authored or co-authored some of the state \u2019 s trend-setting \u2013 and controversial \u2013 laws : \u201c motor voter \u201d that provides automatic voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles ; mandatory vaccination for children that removes the personal belief exemption ; and most recently , the law that redefines work in the gig economy , turning independent contractors for flexible-work companies like Uber into employees with benefits .\nThat labor law , signed in September by Democratic Gov . Gavin Newsom , could become a national model , though not without a rearguard fight from app-based companies like Lyft , Uber , and DoorDash , which are planning a ballot initiative counteroffensive in California next year . The law is due to take effect on Jan. 1 .\nOn this and other sharp-edged legislation , Ms. Gonzalez is unapologetic \u2013 something she learned from working for Lieutenant Governor Bustamante . He once told her , \u201c I want you to be so aggressive that I have to apologize for you. \u201d She tells her staff the same thing today .\nYet for all their political mobilizing and organizing , Latinos in the Golden State still lag behind on most social and economic indicators .\nLaura Cluth\u00e9/Special to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles ( Chirla ) is an influential Latino group .\nA 2017 report for California \u2019 s state Senate found that Latinos are less well off , with 23 % of them in poverty in 2010-14 , compared with 12 % of non-Latinos . Median household income in the same period was $ 47,200 , far short of the $ 69,606 median income for non-Latinos . They also receive public assistance at a higher rate .\nOne encouraging sign : The number of Latinos entering a California college or university more than doubled in the decade ending with 2013 . But they suffer a \u201c substantial \u201d achievement gap in K-12 , are more likely to be obese and food insecure , and to live in heavily polluted communities .\nAdd to this sobering picture increases in the gasoline tax and an affordable housing crisis , and some Republicans see an opening to win over disenchanted voters from the Democratic Party . The California GOP has shrunk dramatically : Less than a quarter of registered voters are Republicans . In this majority-minority state , they need to make inroads with nonwhites . Indeed , their recently elected leader , Jessica Patterson , is a millennial Latina .\nBut it \u2019 s too late , says Mike Madrid , a Latino GOP consultant and expert on Latino voting in the state . Given the rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration , particularly its border policies , \u201c this generation will never come to the Republican Party . \u201d\nLatinos who grow disappointed with Democrats , he says , are presented with what Mr. Madrid calls an \u201c unfortunate \u201d choice : \u201c You can vote for a party that doesn \u2019 t have your interests at heart , or you can vote for a party that hates you . \u201d\nSusan Rubio , a first-term Democratic senator in Sacramento , was 6 years old and living in Texas when her family was deported in the 1970s . Her father had overstayed a temporary worker program , and one day the family was picked up while it was at a carnival and sent back to Ju\u00e1rez , the Mexican border city where she was born .\nThe family eventually settled in the Los Angeles area and became legal residents , but for Senator Rubio deportation was always at the back of her mind . \u201c I clearly remember the rhetoric of the time . I would compare it a little to what \u2019 s happening nationally today , \u201d she says .\nShe was a young adult in 1994 when Governor Wilson released a campaign ad in which a narrator intones , \u201c They keep coming , \u201d as grainy black-and-white footage shows migrants running between the cars at the U.S.-Mexico border . Two months before the election , Democratic President Bill Clinton launched Operation Gatekeeper to fortify the border at San Diego . It also had the effect of pushing unauthorized immigrants into more remote areas .\nMs. Rubio decided it was time to become a citizen , as did her family .\nWhat followed was 17 years as a public school teacher and a life in public service \u2013 winning elections for city clerk and city council in Baldwin Park , in eastern Los Angeles County . What also followed , she notes , was a noticeable ratcheting down in California of the rhetoric and a change in attitude about immigrants .\n\u201c There \u2019 s so much more respect for immigrants in general , \u201d Ms. Rubio says in a phone interview from Mexico , where she was traveling in a delegation with California \u2019 s lieutenant governor , Eleni Kounalakis . \u201c And there is so much more respect \u201d for elected Latino officials , she adds .\nIndeed , Latino politicians have become ubiquitous in the state capital and in cities like Los Angeles , which has had back-to-back Latino mayors .\nAs a little girl , in high school , and even as a young adult , \u201c we didn \u2019 t see a lot of people who looked like us , \u201d says Ms. Rubio . So when Latinos such as herself began to run for local office , it made a difference . During the 2010 census , people felt safe coming to ask her for help , and as a councilwoman she could explain why filling out the census was beneficial . Latinos in office \u201c gave our community a sense of safety . Someone was looking out for their interests . \u201d\nSurveys bear out a change in attitude . In 1998 , only 46 % of adults believed that \u201c immigrants are a benefit to California , \u201d according to the Public Policy Institute of California . In 2018 , 72 % did . A recent Gallup poll finds a similar shift nationwide since 2001 .\nPoliticians , particularly on the left , have altered their views . It took multiple tries over more than a decade before a driver \u2019 s license bill for unauthorized immigrants was signed into law . Now the state \u2019 s new governor , Mr. Newsom , wants health care for all . In his first year , he expanded Medicaid to unauthorized youths up to age 26 .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve gotten to the point where now on immigration stuff we \u2019 ll have a couple of Republicans vote with us , \u201d says Ms. Gonzalez . Part of it is hearts moved by the stories of Dreamers , she says , but a lot of it is about political power . \u201c They know the power of the Latino population and the Latino vote . \u201d\nThe big question for the nation is whether what happened with the Latino vote in California could be repeated at the presidential level . \u201c California represents what happens when Latinos as swing voters become permanent Democratic supporters , \u201d Dr. Romero wrote in a 2014 report . \u201c Latinos swung the state from being solidly Republican to being safely and consistently Democratic today . \u201d\nNationwide , the Latino population is projected to more than double between 2015 and 2040 . By that time , nearly 30 % of the U.S. population will be Latinos , the majority of them the children and grandchildren of immigrants . But here \u2019 s the thing . While this population is growing nationally , the growth isn \u2019 t uniform .\nMost Latinos do not live in swing states \u2013 Florida is a big exception \u2013 which limits their potential impact on the next presidential election . At the same time , Latino turnout has long been a challenge ; turnout levels spiked in California after Proposition 187 , then settled back down again .\nLatino turnout fell short in the 2016 presidential election , including in Florida where it declined by more than 7 percentage points compared with 2012 , according to Dr. Romero . Had turnout not slumped in Florida and other states , Latinos could have tipped the balance enough to put Hillary Clinton in the White House .\nNor are Latinos monolithic in their party leanings . A new study by the University of Houston points out that in some states \u2013 like Texas and Florida \u2013 larger percentages of Hispanics back Republicans than in other states , such as California and New York , though a majority still votes Democratic .\nCarlo Allegri/Reuters/File A person holds a sign reading \u201c Latinos for Trump \u201d at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 20 , 2016 . Most Latinos vote Democratic . Some Republicans fear that President Donald Trump \u2019 s rhetoric will deepen that attachment .\nAnother potentially mitigating factor : Latinos have pushed the Democratic Party to the left , at least on immigration . That could cost a presidential nominee in swing states .\nAt the Democratic presidential debate in June , all of the candidates favored health care for unauthorized immigrants , yet polls show that a majority of voters think this is a bad idea . Some candidates also support decriminalizing illegal border crossings . Jeh Johnson , who served as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama , told The Washington Post this was \u201c tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders . \u201d\nYet Latino leaders are convinced that the president \u2019 s vituperative rhetoric about immigrants and his handling of the border will galvanize Latino voters and drive them to the polls . \u201c Donald Trump is a more exaggerated and social media version of what Pete Wilson did to us , \u201d says Ms. Gonzalez . \u201c Donald Trump again has us motivated . \u201d\nThat seemed to be the case in the 2018 midterm elections . Turnout overall reached a historic high for an off-year election , but it was particularly pronounced for Hispanics and Asians .\nAccording to the Pew Research Center , the number of Latino voters nearly doubled from the previous midterm \u2013 from 6.8 million to 11.7 million voters .\nThat said , Dr. Romero is cautious about the \u201c Trump effect , \u201d arguing that Latinos care about specifics that affect their lives .\nTowering over all these caveats about turnout , party preferences , and swing states is population growth : More Latinos are joining the voter-age population every year . In California , Latino population growth and party preference \u2013 more than turnout rates \u2013 have proved decisive . In last year \u2019 s midterms , population growth and higher turnout among Latino voters helped oust Republicans in seven California congressional districts .\nIt \u2019 s not clear if and when Latino votes might reshape the presidential electoral map . Key red states to watch are Texas and Arizona , says Angie Gutierrez , a Ph.D. candidate studying the issue at the University of California , Los Angeles .\nIn Texas \u201c we saw a lot of Latinos go to the polls in the midterm election . I think this is an indication that Texas might not be staying with the Republican Party as long as some might think , \u201d she says . But Latinos can \u2019 t flip these states by themselves ; white voters also have to swing to the Democratic side .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

Before Governor Wilson backed Proposition 187, Latino voter registration only slightly favored Democrats, says Dr. Romero, an expert on Latino voting patterns.\n\nToday, close to 60% of registered Latino voters in California are Democrats, she says, and most unaffiliated Latinos vote the same way. Latino registration with Republicans is in the low teens. At 40% of the population, Latinos are California\u2019s largest, and fastest growing, ethnic group.\n\nDamian Dovarganes/AP/File Richard Avina (center) assists Judith Ceja with finding her voting place in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\nLegislators, too, systematically built their caucus. It began in 1973 with five members. They were too small to influence legislation, but they built important political bridges, including one to Democratic Speaker Willie Brown. In 1981, he named one of their members to chair a redistricting committee, which then drew new districts favorable to Latinos.\n\nThese early efforts helped pave the way for much greater Latino representation in the 1990s. But it did not happen organically. Richard Polanco, former state legislator and Senate majority leader from East Los Angeles, is widely credited as the architect of today\u2019s powerful Latino caucus.\n\nMr. Polanco says that Proposition 187, redistricting, and term limits \u2013 which opened up seats \u2013 were all important factors in building the caucus. But it also required a strategic approach and caucus discipline.\n\nHe and others identified recruits, and assisted them with financial resources and campaign management. In exchange, the recruits were asked to help raise funds and walk and talk with voters. \u201cNothing else mattered,\u201d Mr. Polanco recalls.\n\nHe also broke an unspoken rule of not putting up candidates against a Democratic incumbent or someone backed by the party.\n\n\u201cWe communicated to the speaker, \u2018With all due respect, we\u2019ll do what we can to support the Democratic caucus, but we\u2019re going to engage.\u2019 And we did.\u201d\n\nBetween 1991 and 2002, the caucus grew from seven members to 22, a surge that vastly increased Latino leverage in the Legislature. A series of Latino speakers, wielding power over the agenda, ensued. Latinos took on key committee chairmanships and pushed groundbreaking legislation.\n\nRich Pedroncelli/AP/File \u201cLatinos changed the political structure.\u201d \u2013 Richard Polanco, former California Senate majority leader\n\nSays Mr. Polanco, \u201cLatinos changed the political structure.\u201d\n\nOf her many bills, one that Ms. Gonzalez is proudest of is mandatory sick days for part- and full-time workers in the private sector. Back in 2014, more than 6 million Californians could not get a paid day off for ill health. After the law took effect a year later, people would come up to her and show off their pay stubs, pointing out that they had earned sick days.\n\n\u201cI remember a worker from McDonald\u2019s showing me, and he was so proud and just so excited,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s an example of the broader laws pushed by Latino legislators that intersect with the interests of their community, but don\u2019t focus on them exclusively. It\u2019s also an example of the national ripple effect that such laws can have and how they shape the Democratic agenda.\n\nAt least eight other states have adopted paid sick leave since California became an early adopter. A similar number have also opted to ban single-use plastic bags, while restaurants across the nation now list calorie counts on their menus. Both were California firsts \u2013 and both were authored by Secretary of State Padilla when he was in the Senate.\n\nMs. Gonzalez, a high-energy lawmaker with a laser focus on working-class issues, has become a state lawmaker to watch.\n\nShe has authored or co-authored some of the state\u2019s trend-setting \u2013 and controversial \u2013 laws: \u201cmotor voter\u201d that provides automatic voter registration at the Department of Motor Vehicles; mandatory vaccination for children that removes the personal belief exemption; and most recently, the law that redefines work in the gig economy, turning independent contractors for flexible-work companies like Uber into employees with benefits.\n\nThat labor law, signed in September by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, could become a national model, though not without a rearguard fight from app-based companies like Lyft, Uber, and DoorDash, which are planning a ballot initiative counteroffensive in California next year. The law is due to take effect on Jan. 1.\n\nOn this and other sharp-edged legislation, Ms. Gonzalez is unapologetic \u2013 something she learned from working for Lieutenant Governor Bustamante. He once told her, \u201cI want you to be so aggressive that I have to apologize for you.\u201d She tells her staff the same thing today.\n\nYet for all their political mobilizing and organizing, Latinos in the Golden State still lag behind on most social and economic indicators.\n\nLaura Cluth\u00e9/Special to The Christian Science Monitor The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (Chirla) is an influential Latino group.\n\nA 2017 report for California\u2019s state Senate found that Latinos are less well off, with 23% of them in poverty in 2010-14, compared with 12% of non-Latinos. Median household income in the same period was $47,200, far short of the $69,606 median income for non-Latinos. They also receive public assistance at a higher rate.\n\nOne encouraging sign: The number of Latinos entering a California college or university more than doubled in the decade ending with 2013. But they suffer a \u201csubstantial\u201d achievement gap in K-12, are more likely to be obese and food insecure, and to live in heavily polluted communities.\n\nAdd to this sobering picture increases in the gasoline tax and an affordable housing crisis, and some Republicans see an opening to win over disenchanted voters from the Democratic Party. The California GOP has shrunk dramatically: Less than a quarter of registered voters are Republicans. In this majority-minority state, they need to make inroads with nonwhites. Indeed, their recently elected leader, Jessica Patterson, is a millennial Latina.\n\nBut it\u2019s too late, says Mike Madrid, a Latino GOP consultant and expert on Latino voting in the state. Given the rhetoric and actions of the Trump administration, particularly its border policies, \u201cthis generation will never come to the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nLatinos who grow disappointed with Democrats, he says, are presented with what Mr. Madrid calls an \u201cunfortunate\u201d choice: \u201cYou can vote for a party that doesn\u2019t have your interests at heart, or you can vote for a party that hates you.\u201d\n\nGrowing respect for immigrants\n\nSusan Rubio, a first-term Democratic senator in Sacramento, was 6 years old and living in Texas when her family was deported in the 1970s. Her father had overstayed a temporary worker program, and one day the family was picked up while it was at a carnival and sent back to Ju\u00e1rez, the Mexican border city where she was born.\n\nThe family eventually settled in the Los Angeles area and became legal residents, but for Senator Rubio deportation was always at the back of her mind. \u201cI clearly remember the rhetoric of the time. I would compare it a little to what\u2019s happening nationally today,\u201d she says.\n\nShe was a young adult in 1994 when Governor Wilson released a campaign ad in which a narrator intones, \u201cThey keep coming,\u201d as grainy black-and-white footage shows migrants running between the cars at the U.S.-Mexico border. Two months before the election, Democratic President Bill Clinton launched Operation Gatekeeper to fortify the border at San Diego. It also had the effect of pushing unauthorized immigrants into more remote areas.\n\nMs. Rubio decided it was time to become a citizen, as did her family.\n\nWhat followed was 17 years as a public school teacher and a life in public service \u2013 winning elections for city clerk and city council in Baldwin Park, in eastern Los Angeles County. What also followed, she notes, was a noticeable ratcheting down in California of the rhetoric and a change in attitude about immigrants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much more respect for immigrants in general,\u201d Ms. Rubio says in a phone interview from Mexico, where she was traveling in a delegation with California\u2019s lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis. \u201cAnd there is so much more respect\u201d for elected Latino officials, she adds.\n\nIndeed, Latino politicians have become ubiquitous in the state capital and in cities like Los Angeles, which has had back-to-back Latino mayors.\n\nAs a little girl, in high school, and even as a young adult, \u201cwe didn\u2019t see a lot of people who looked like us,\u201d says Ms. Rubio. So when Latinos such as herself began to run for local office, it made a difference. During the 2010 census, people felt safe coming to ask her for help, and as a councilwoman she could explain why filling out the census was beneficial. Latinos in office \u201cgave our community a sense of safety. Someone was looking out for their interests.\u201d\n\nSurveys bear out a change in attitude. In 1998, only 46% of adults believed that \u201cimmigrants are a benefit to California,\u201d according to the Public Policy Institute of California. In 2018, 72% did. A recent Gallup poll finds a similar shift nationwide since 2001.\n\nPoliticians, particularly on the left, have altered their views. It took multiple tries over more than a decade before a driver\u2019s license bill for unauthorized immigrants was signed into law. Now the state\u2019s new governor, Mr. Newsom, wants health care for all. In his first year, he expanded Medicaid to unauthorized youths up to age 26.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to the point where now on immigration stuff we\u2019ll have a couple of Republicans vote with us,\u201d says Ms. Gonzalez. Part of it is hearts moved by the stories of Dreamers, she says, but a lot of it is about political power. \u201cThey know the power of the Latino population and the Latino vote.\u201d\n\nThe big question for the nation is whether what happened with the Latino vote in California could be repeated at the presidential level. \u201cCalifornia represents what happens when Latinos as swing voters become permanent Democratic supporters,\u201d Dr. Romero wrote in a 2014 report. \u201cLatinos swung the state from being solidly Republican to being safely and consistently Democratic today.\u201d\n\nTurnout trends\n\nNationwide, the Latino population is projected to more than double between 2015 and 2040. By that time, nearly 30% of the U.S. population will be Latinos, the majority of them the children and grandchildren of immigrants. But here\u2019s the thing. While this population is growing nationally, the growth isn\u2019t uniform.\n\nMost Latinos do not live in swing states \u2013 Florida is a big exception \u2013 which limits their potential impact on the next presidential election. At the same time, Latino turnout has long been a challenge; turnout levels spiked in California after Proposition 187, then settled back down again.\n\nLatino turnout fell short in the 2016 presidential election, including in Florida where it declined by more than 7 percentage points compared with 2012, according to Dr. Romero. Had turnout not slumped in Florida and other states, Latinos could have tipped the balance enough to put Hillary Clinton in the White House.\n\nNor are Latinos monolithic in their party leanings. A new study by the University of Houston points out that in some states \u2013 like Texas and Florida \u2013 larger percentages of Hispanics back Republicans than in other states, such as California and New York, though a majority still votes Democratic.\n\nCarlo Allegri/Reuters/File A person holds a sign reading \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 20, 2016. Most Latinos vote Democratic. Some Republicans fear that President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric will deepen that attachment.\n\nAnother potentially mitigating factor: Latinos have pushed the Democratic Party to the left, at least on immigration. That could cost a presidential nominee in swing states.\n\nAt the Democratic presidential debate in June, all of the candidates favored health care for unauthorized immigrants, yet polls show that a majority of voters think this is a bad idea. Some candidates also support decriminalizing illegal border crossings. Jeh Johnson, who served as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama, told The Washington Post this was \u201ctantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders.\u201d\n\nYet Latino leaders are convinced that the president\u2019s vituperative rhetoric about immigrants and his handling of the border will galvanize Latino voters and drive them to the polls. \u201cDonald Trump is a more exaggerated and social media version of what Pete Wilson did to us,\u201d says Ms. Gonzalez. \u201cDonald Trump again has us motivated.\u201d\n\nThat seemed to be the case in the 2018 midterm elections. Turnout overall reached a historic high for an off-year election, but it was particularly pronounced for Hispanics and Asians.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, the number of Latino voters nearly doubled from the previous midterm \u2013 from 6.8 million to 11.7 million voters.\n\nThat said, Dr. Romero is cautious about the \u201cTrump effect,\u201d arguing that Latinos care about specifics that affect their lives.\n\nTowering over all these caveats about turnout, party preferences, and swing states is population growth: More Latinos are joining the voter-age population every year. In California, Latino population growth and party preference \u2013 more than turnout rates \u2013 have proved decisive. In last year\u2019s midterms, population growth and higher turnout among Latino voters helped oust Republicans in seven California congressional districts.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if and when Latino votes might reshape the presidential electoral map. Key red states to watch are Texas and Arizona, says Angie Gutierrez, a Ph.D. candidate studying the issue at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nIn Texas \u201cwe saw a lot of Latinos go to the polls in the midterm election. I think this is an indication that Texas might not be staying with the Republican Party as long as some might think,\u201d she says. But Latinos can\u2019t flip these states by themselves; white voters also have to swing to the Democratic side.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
