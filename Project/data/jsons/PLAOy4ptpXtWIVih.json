    "content": "Before Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. testified to the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday , the ranking Democrat had a warning for his colleagues on the panel : Play nice .\nMr. Holder has a testier relationship with Congress than any other Cabinet secretary , as he has fended off inquiries over a botched gun-running operation , his lawsuits against states \u2019 immigration policies , and the Obama administration \u2019 s justification for killing U.S. citizens in the fight against terrorist groups .\nHe also likely is sitting on more major unanswered information requests than any other secretary as he tries to negotiate separation-of-powers and national security issues and \u2014 according to Republicans \u2014 do political damage-control as well .\nLongtime committee members said his relationship compares poorly to that of past attorneys general , who themselves were no strangers to bloody fights with Congress .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s worse , and it \u2019 s continuing to deteriorate both in terms of the nonresponsiveness to the requests from our committee and other committees as well , but also his unwillingness to take responsibility when things go wrong , \u201d said Rep. Bob Goodlatte , Virginia Republican and a senior member of the committee , who is serving his 10th term .\nAs the country \u2019 s top lawyer , Mr. Holder oversees everything from the FBI to federal civil rights laws to voting practices in the states , and he has made no apologies about his progressive politics . He also says part of his job is political \u2014 though he says his decisions don \u2019 t stem from ideology .\n\u201c They reflect my view of the facts , the law and what my responsibility is as attorney general of the United States , \u201d he said .\nRough relationships between the administration and Congress are usual , and President George W. Bush \u2019 s officials often faced tough questions from Democrats when they controlled Congress .\nBut lawmakers still knew Thursday \u2019 s hearing would be testy , with many heated issues at hand . Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan , the panel \u2019 s top Democrat , warned his colleagues ahead of time to act \u201c in a manner that is worthy of the attorney general \u2019 s present appearance here . \u201d\nCabinet secretaries usually leave each appearance with a to-do list , including questions they promise to answer . Committee aides said Mr. Holder finally replied over the past week to many of the outstanding questions from his last appearance , but there are some key places where they said he is holding out :\n\u2022 Several lawmakers are seeking information on the department \u2019 s decision not to prosecute some of the co-conspirators in the case against the Holy Land Foundation , a Muslim charity shut down over convictions for financing Islamist terrorism . Mr. Holder promised to \u201c make a good-faith effort \u201d to look at the request \u2014 lodged more than a year ago \u2014 but he said the information might be from a grand jury or otherwise out of bounds .\n\u2022 Rep. Elton Gallegly , California Republican , is seeking information on how many prosecutions the Justice Department has made in immigration worksite-enforcement cases . Mr. Holder said he thought he had replied and apologized if that information hadn \u2019 t been sent over yet .\n\u2022 The committee also is seeking information on why the Justice Department still hasn \u2019 t closed its investigation into CIA interrogators ; whether the department pressured a litigant to drop a Supreme Court appeal in order to prevent an adverse ruling on housing discrimination ; and on applicants for the department \u2019 s Civil Rights Division .\nIn some cases , the department says it doesn \u2019 t have to comply , while in other cases it acknowledges the requests but , according to committee members and aides , doesn \u2019 t answer substantively .\nThen there \u2019 s Fast and Furious , the gun-running operation that attracts the most attention and spawns the most heated exchanges .\nRepublicans argue Mr. Holder and his top lieutenants either knew or should have known about the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives \u2019 decision to allow straw purchases of guns in Arizona , knowing the weapons were being taken across the border to arm Mexican cartels .\nThe operation finally was halted after at least two of the guns turned up at the site of a shootout that left U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry dead in December 2010 .\nRepublicans say Mr. Holder is stonewalling their investigation , and last month , House Speaker John A. Boehner and his leadership team wrote a letter warning Mr. Holder to cooperate in the Fast and Furious investigation or the House would have to take further steps , possibly including holding him in contempt of Congress .\nOn Thursday Mr. Holder said he is willing to meet personally with Republican leaders \u201c and try to come to an accommodation so that we can get you the information that you need consistent with what I think is our need to protect ongoing investigations . \u201d\nRep. Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat , asked whether Mr. Holder would hold a briefing and release to committee members the secret memo justifying the administration \u2019 s program to target and kill American citizens it thinks are opposing the U.S. in the war on terrorism .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll certainly consider the possibility of a briefing , \u201d Mr. Holder said .\nMr. Nadler pushed back : \u201c The possibility ? You won \u2019 t commit to giving a briefing to this committee ? \u201d\nMr. Holder said he \u201c probably \u201d would be able to do that \u2014 and under further questioning said he \u2019 d be able to get an answer within a month .\nAfterward , Mr. Nadler told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 it was a fair answer from the attorney general .\nHe also said relations between the committee and Mr. Holder are not as bad as with other officials at other times in his 22 years in Congress \u2014 and he pointed to the battle with Bush administration Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , to whom the committee ended up issuing subpoenas for documents related to the firing of U.S. attorneys .\n\u201c We spent two years , I think , trying to get stuff . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s nearly as bad as that , \u201d he said . \u201c They fought the subpoenas and then they ignored them . Nothing compares to that . \u201d\nRepublicans , though , said Mr. Holder isn \u2019 t just withholding information , he \u2019 s also refusing to take responsibility .
