No one was hurt , but the incident sent customers running .

Its walls are painted with trendy murals and its owner , James Alefantis , was ranked No . 49 in GQ \u2019 s 2012 edition of the 50 most powerful people in Washington .\nBut to posters on 4Chan and Reddit , the murals contained disguised symbols of pedophilia . It was even posited that Comet Ping Pong \u2019 s logo had Satanic connections . Alefantis \u2019 personal social media postings , which contained popular memes and pictures of family and friends , were dissected for alleged links to the sex scheme .
