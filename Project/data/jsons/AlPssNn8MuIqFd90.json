During an off-the-record question-and-answer session with House Speaker Paul Ryan , Meg Whitman , the billionaire Hewlett Packard chief executive officer , confronted the speaker over his endorsement of Trump . Whitman , a major GOP giver who ran for California governor in 2010 , compared Trump to historical demagogues like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and wanted to know how the speaker could get behind him .\nAt another discussion session during the day , which featured top Romney alumni Stuart Stevens and Matt Rhoades , Ana Navarro , a Republican contributor and ubiquitous cable news personality , called Trump a \u201c racist \u201d and a \u201c vulgarian and a pig who has made disgusting comments about women for years. \u201d ( Neither Whitman nor Navarro would comment . )\nEven Ryan , who has endorsed Trump despite criticizing his behavior , joked during his presentation on Friday that in a recent conversation with magician David Copperfield , he said that he wished he could make himself disappear .\nThe incidents , which were relayed by three sources who were present \u2014 one of whom described them as \u201c shocking \u201d \u2014 illustrates the intense anger coursing through the GOP donor community .

Some of his top fundraisers think he \u2019 ll struggle to top $ 300 million , a figure that \u2019 s less than a third of what Romney raised in 2012 and a small fraction of what Hillary Clinton is expected to bring in .\nSome are convinced the situation is growing increasingly bleak . In an interview here , Spencer Zwick , Romney \u2019 s former finance chair and one of the most prominent fundraisers in Republican politics , said that some of Romney \u2019 s donors would stay on the sidelines \u2014 and that others would even give to his Democratic opponent .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 ll see some that end up supporting Secretary Clinton , \u201d he said .\nThe interest in Clinton , however peripheral , was on display this week .
