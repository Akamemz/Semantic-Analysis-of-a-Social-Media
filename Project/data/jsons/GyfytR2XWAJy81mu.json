    "content": "As investigators learn more about the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings and what Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother , Tamerlan , allegedly did , the initial theory is that `` these two young men were working on their own , '' NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston said Tuesday on Morning Edition .\nAuthorities continue to question 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , who remains hospitalized . He 's being treated at a Boston hospital for a variety of injuries he sustained during gun battles with police on Friday . It 's also possible he tried to kill himself before he was captured that evening in the Boston suburb of Watertown , Mass .\nInvestigators say they are hearing from Tsarnaev through notes he 's writing in response to questions . Other than one comment from the magistrate who presided at his hospital-bed arraignment Monday , there 's been no indication the suspect is able to speak more than a word or two at a time . The magistrate reported that Tsarnaev said `` no '' when asked if he could afford a lawyer .\nAccording to law enforcement sources Dina has spoken with , the information they 've gotten from the 19-year-old leads them to suspect \u2014 so far \u2014 that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the `` driving force '' behind the bombings at the marathon ( which killed three people and wounded more than 200 ) .\nThe information Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been giving to investigators , Dina added , has them theorizing the attack was `` in a sense a homegrown plot with a little bit of an international flavor . '' Tamerlan Tsarnaev , who reportedly had grown increasingly interested in an extremist form of Islam in recent years , traveled to Russia at least once . The family has Chechen roots .\nCNN says investigators also believe the brothers were influenced by things they read on the Internet , and may have learned about bomb-making there , as well .\nAn important reminder : The investigation is still in its early stages . Authorities will uncover much more evidence . The picture of what led the brothers to allegedly plant bombs at the marathon and then , allegedly , kill an MIT police officer and engage in a harrowing gun battle with authorities , could change substantially .\nWe 'll be following Tuesday 's developments and will update as news comes in .\nThe Watertown man who found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding in his boat says he is an `` incidental hero . ''\nDavid Henneberry tells WCVB that contrary to what 's been reported , he did not see blood outside his boat . There was `` no indication of anything . '' Instead Henneberry was simply going outside to fix some foam rollers that had fallen off .\nWhen he rolled up the boat cover , he saw blood on the floor of the boat , then he looked toward the front and saw more blood . When he looked toward the engine , he saw a body . He did not see a face .\n`` It 's surreal , '' Henneberry said . `` I was n't out on the prowl . I was out to see my boat and I stumbled upon this . ''\nWe encourage you to head to WCVB 's site to watch the entire interview .\nThe New York Times reports that the older Tsarnaev bought fireworks at a store in New Hampshire , about an hour north of Boston .\n`` He came in and he asked the question that 90 percent of males ask when they walk into a fireworks store : 'What 's the most powerful thing you 've got ? ' '' William Weimer , vice president of Phantom Fireworks , told the Times .\n`` Mr. Tsarnaev settled on a reloadable mortar kit called a Lock and Load , which comes with a launch tube and shells , Mr. Weimer said . But Mr. Weimer said that even if the brothers had harvested all the powder from the shells Mr. Tsarnaev bought that day , he does not believe it would have yielded enough explosives to make the two pressure cooker bombs that exploded on Boylston Street and the other devices that the suspects had with them when they were chased by the police early Friday morning . The sale was first reported by The Wall Street Journal . ''\nUpdate at 8:21 p.m . ET . FBI Contacted U.S . Multiple Times :\nRussia contacted the United States multiple times about Tamerlan Tsarnaev , according to a senator briefed on the issue .\n`` In a closed briefing on Tuesday , members of the Senate Intelligence Committee learned that Russia alerted the United States about Tsarnaev in `` multiple contacts '' \u2014 including 'at least once since October 2011 , ' said Richard Burr , a Republican of North Carolina , speaking with reporters afterward . `` Senators said the briefing also revealed failures among federal agencies to share vital information about Tsarnaev , indicating , they said , that the US government still has not established a strong system to 'connect the dots ' about would-be terrorists residing in America more than a decade after 9/11 .
