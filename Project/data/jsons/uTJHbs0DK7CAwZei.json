    "content": "Donald Trump would not commit Wednesday night to accepting the results of the presidential election if he loses on Nov. 8 , in a striking moment during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that underscored the deepening tensions in the race \u2013 as the bitter rivals defined the choice for voters on an array of issues not three weeks from Election Day .\nThe debate in Las Vegas , moderated by \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 Chris Wallace , started with a measured discussion on policy disputes ranging from gun rights to abortion to immigration . But it ended with the candidates hurling a grab-bag of accusations and insults at each other .\nTrump called Clinton a \u201c nasty woman. \u201d Clinton called Trump the \u201c most dangerous \u201d person to run for president in modern history .\nThe most pointed moment came when Trump \u2013 who for weeks has warned of a \u201c rigged \u201d election \u2013 was asked whether he will commit to accept the results of the election .\n\u201c I will look at it at the time , \u201d Trump said , citing his concerns about voter registration fraud , a \u201c corrupt media \u201d and an opponent he claimed \u201c shouldn \u2019 t be allowed to run \u201d because she committed a \u201c very serious crime \u201d with her emails .\nPressed again whether he \u2019 s prepared to concede if he loses , Trump again said : \u201c I will tell you at the time . I \u2019 ll keep you in suspense . \u201d\n\u201c That is not the way our democracy works , \u201d she said . \u201c He is denigrating , he \u2019 s talking down our democracy and I for one am appalled . \u201d\nTrump responded by calling the Justice Department \u2019 s handling of her email probe \u201c disgraceful . \u201d\nThe exchange was among many contentious moments at Wednesday \u2019 s debate , which covered several issues including the national debt that have gotten little attention in the race so far \u2013 but flared with arguments between the candidates over WikiLeaks , over Russia , over the Clinton Foundation and over women \u2019 s allegations of groping against Trump .\nThrough the thicket of accusations and personal animus \u2013 they never shook hands on stage \u2013 the candidates tried generally to mount a closing debate-stage argument about experience .\n\u201c For 30 years , you \u2019 ve been in a position to help . \u2026 The problem is you talk , but you don \u2019 t get anything done , Hillary , \u201d Trump said . \u201c If you become president , this country is going to be in some mess , believe me . \u201d\nClinton countered by contrasting some of her experiences against Trump \u2019 s . She said when she was monitoring the Usama bin Laden raid in the Situation Room , \u201c He was hosting \u2018 The Celebrity Apprentice . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m happy to compare my 30 years of experience \u2026 with your 30 years , and I will let the American people make that decision , \u201d Clinton said .\nTrump , meanwhile , again disputed the multiple allegations of groping that women have leveled against him since the candidates \u2019 last encounter . He also said he thinks the Clinton campaign is behind the claims , charging , \u201c They either want fame or her campaign did it . \u201d\nClinton said , \u201c Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. \u201d Trump repeated that \u201c nobody has more respect for women \u201d than him .\nTrump then shifted to blast the Clinton Foundation as a \u201c criminal enterprise. \u201d He pointed to donations from countries like Saudi Arabia to question Clinton \u2019 s commitment to women \u2019 s rights . He asked her if she would return money from countries that treat certain \u201c groups of people horribly , \u201d which she did not answer directly .\nThe candidates \u2019 third and final debate now sets a bitter tone for the homestretch of the 2016 presidential campaign \u2013 a race that already stands out as arguably the most personal , caustic and unpredictable White House battle in modern politics .\nTrump , slipping in the polls amid various campaign controversies , said at the last debate that Clinton should be in jail . Clinton has blasted Trump all along as temperamentally unfit for office .\nSince the second debate , numerous women have come forward to accuse Trump of groping them , allegations he denies .
