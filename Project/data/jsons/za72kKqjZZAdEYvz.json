John Kerry , D-Mass. , who was confirmed this week to be secretary of state .\nKerry and Hagel have a prominent biographical detail in common : service in Vietnam .\n`` As a veteran of war , I will always carry the consequences of our decisions in my mind , '' Kerry said at the start of his confirmation hearing .\nAnd when President Obama announced his choice of Hagel for defense secretary , he said : `` To this day , Chuck bears the scars \u2014 and the shrapnel \u2014 from battles he fought in our name . ''\nThe White House emphasizes that both Kerry and Hagel understand the full cost of war \u2014 in money and in lives . Obama says he believes that makes them the right men for this moment , as the administration shifts its approach following a decade of big , expensive , bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nAs Tommy Vietor , a White House spokesman , puts it : `` I do n't think we can necessarily say without a doubt that there will never be a large war again . However , certainly we 've moved conceptually toward a more targeted , surgical approach that focuses on al-Qaida .\n`` So you do n't have this 100,000-troop footprint in Iraq to deal with a far smaller group of individuals that are actually targeting the United States . ''\nThe `` targeted , surgical approach '' that Vietor describes relies less on the military and more on the CIA \u2014 which brings up Obama 's third major national security nomination : CIA Director-in-waiting John Brennan , a longtime Obama adviser .\n`` Al-Qaida seeks to bleed us financially by drawing us into long , costly wars that also inflame anti-American sentiment , '' Brennan said two years ago during a speech in Washington . `` Our best offense wo n't always be deploying large armies abroad , but rather delivering targeted , surgical pressure to the groups that threaten us . ''\nThere 's that phrase again : `` targeted , surgical . '' When Vietor is asked if that 's a euphemism for drones and a kill list , he says : `` The way we think about this for a president is , he does n't have a choice about whether to do counterterrorism operations or not . There are threats to the United States , and his obligation is to protect the American people .\n`` He has a choice about how he conducts these counterterrorism operations . ''\nSo these three nominations \u2014 Kerry , Hagel and Brennan \u2014 represent a shift in the way the U.S. wages war . It 's a shift from big to small , from the Pentagon to the CIA .\nLegal experts say it 's also a shift from clear , public rules to murky , secret ones .\nThe rules for invading a country are well-established and were developed over hundreds of years . But when the U.S. decides to go after a small group of suspected terrorists spread out in many different countries , it 's a whole new ballgame , says Benjamin Wittes , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .\n`` That is a much , much more complicated and much less charted area of international law , of U.S. domestic law , in some ways , '' he says . `` It 's an area that is really important to the future , as represented by these nominations , I think . ''\nIt 's controversial , too . Obama has had some pushback , though more overseas than at home . Regardless , it 's now part of his legacy , says Karen Greenberg , who runs the national security program at Fordham University 's law school .\n`` Remember , President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize by saying war is necessary , '' she says . `` He 's somebody who understands , to his mind , what he sees as the need of war to create peace .
