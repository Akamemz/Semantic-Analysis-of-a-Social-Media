    "content": "Confused taxpayers , jammed help lines and tax cheaters running rampant \u2014 the IRS for months has warned that drastic budget cuts will disable an already troubled agency .\nInstead , they \u2019 re biding their time until they seize control of both chambers next year , giving them majorities to financially gut the most hated government agencies and new leverage to get agencies to do what they want .\nA top priority ? Crippling IRS regulatory actions , from Obamacare \u2019 s individual mandate to the looming draft rule that will limit political activities of groups like Crossroads GPS . The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services are among the others in the cross hairs .\n\u201c We need to push back on the regulatory overreach of this administration across the board , whether that \u2019 s the IRS , the EPA or any other agency , \u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) . \u201c The power of the purse is the greatest lever of power Congress holds . \u201d\nWith seemingly little pushback from Democrats , the GOP this week secured $ 350 million in IRS budget cuts into the \u201c cromnibus , \u201d just weeks before one of the toughest tax seasons starts . The cuts to the IRS \u2014 and the larger negotiations on the year-end spending bill \u2014 offer a sneak peek at what Republicans plan to do when they are able to dominate government spending decisions .\nIRS watchers warn that the agency is spiraling toward a rocky future that will rival some of its darkest days in its history , when whistleblowers blew the lid off IRS agents abusing power and thousands of tax returns were lost in the mail .\n\u201c Unless we are able to correct this , very bad things will happen to taxpayers , \u201d said National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson at a November tax preparer conference \u2014 over a month before the latest budget cuts even came to light .\nSpending negotiators this week froze most agency budgets but reduced the IRS funds to $ 10.9 billion , a 3 percent cut over last year and $ 1.5 billion below the president \u2019 s request . Appropriators bragged in a release that the level is even lower than the IRS \u2019 s 2008 budget .\nThose new cuts come atop more than a $ 1 billion reduction to the IRS budget since 2010 , which has forced the tax-collecting agency to shed 13,000 employees while it serves an additional 7 million taxpayers , according to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen .\nThose reductions are about to manifest in what Olson is predicting will be the \u201c worst filing season \u201d in years . For the first time , the agency will be administering Obamacare and another massive international tax law .\nEven before the new cuts , the IRS was warning that half of taxpayers who call the IRS for help wouldn \u2019 t get through as a result of limited resources to IRS call centers this tax season .\nBut the warnings are falling on deaf ears on Capitol Hill . Republicans are still seething over the IRS tea party targeting scandal , reports of lavish IRS conferences and spending on silly \u201c Star Trek \u201d training videos several years ago .\nEarlier this year , House Republicans passed a whopping $ 1 billion cut to the IRS budget .\nRep.-turned Sen.-elect James Lankford ( R-Okla. ) said Republicans should use spending cuts to force information out of agencies that are less forthcoming with congressional investigators . He called out the IRS and EPA specifically .\n\u201c We \u2019 re just trying to say to them , \u2018 Look , do the things you \u2019 re supposed to do and stop wasting money on conferences and breaking rules , \u201d said Rep. Ander Crenshaw ( R-Fla. ) , the financial services subcommittee chairman who oversees the IRS budgetary process .\nBut Republicans and the IRS have very different views on what the agency is \u201c supposed \u201d to do .\nFor example , Republicans next Congress want to bar the IRS from implementing the Affordable Care Act , which relies on the IRS to oversee the tax credits and penalties for the uninsured . They might try to block the IRS from using any money to work on these issues , tripping up the program .\nAnother top priority : rules for politically active nonprofits , known as social welfare organizations . The IRS early in 2015 is expected to release a draft rule to clarify how much political activity these 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups can legally engage in while keeping their tax-exempt status . Republicans , who prefer laxer campaign-finance rules , say the rule inherently infringes on freedom of speech ; the IRS says it just makes its job easier .\n\u201c I told the commissioner he \u2019 s spending a lot of time and energy and money writing a rule that a lot of people believe violates the constitutional rights of the American people . Start doing things you ought to be doing , \u201d Crenshaw said .\nRep. Peter Roskam , the new Ways and Means oversight chair , said Republicans could potentially write a rider to stop the IRS from enforcing that rule , too . He thinks the IRS is exaggerating its budget situation .\n\u201c This is an agency that [ had the ] wherewithal to make mock videos and to have lavish gatherings , \u201d he said , referring to reports of abuse of funds from several years ago . \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s credible for them to say they don \u2019 t have enough . \u201c\nSenate Democrats this year made Republicans drop a spending bill policy rider to bar the IRS from writing the pending c ( 4 ) rule \u2014 but those Democrats won \u2019 t have such leverage next time around .\nRep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano of New York , the ranking Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee on the IRS , seemed almost proud that Democrats were able to limit GOP cuts to $ 350 million , saying it \u201c could have been worse . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s particularly worried about next year : \u201c We \u2019 re just going to be trying to make their pain less painful . \u201d\nThe looming crackdown is a huge blow to Koskinen , who sought to restore trust in the agency \u2014 and its budget \u2014 after the tea party controversy .\n\u201c Right now , the problem is trying to figure out how to survive with the constraints we are under and the obligations we have , \u201d he told a crowd of tax preparers in November .\nExperts watching the IRS say he \u2019 s right that further cuts will spill over to the taxpayer .\nI worry about some spectacular implosion at some point in the indeterminate yet not too distant future .\n\u201c I worry about some spectacular implosion at some point in the indeterminate yet not too distant future , \u201d said Robert Kerr of the National Association of Enrolled Agents .\nOne of the first things that goes when money gets tight at the IRS is taxpayer service \u2014 namely because the IRS \u2019 s chief obligation is to process returns and carry out law changes .\nEven before the new cuts , the IRS was predicting only 53 percent of taxpayers who call for help would get through to an IRS agent during the 2015 tax season after an average wait of 34 minutes \u2014 the other half would be left to fend for themselves because of budget tightening .\nFor tax practitioners , it \u2019 s even worse . On the practitioner \u201c priority \u201d hotline , a number tax preparers call for help with their clients , the average wait is expected to be 52 minutes .\nTroy Lewis , the American Institute of CPA \u2019 s tax executive committee chair , said he recently waited an hour and 10 minutes for help and has developed a routine when calling the IRS : use the bathroom and grab an hour or two-hour project you can do while waiting . It \u2019 s becoming something of a grim joke in the taxpayer community .\nBut the problem is serious , he says : \u201c Although there can be some good that comes from fiscal tightening , in the end , if there are service restraints , those come out and manifest themselves through the taxpayers and tax practitioners , because they \u2019 re the ones that have to deal with the shortfall . \u201d\nOther experts are worried about enforcement . The most recent budget cuts specifically apply in part to enforcement , which is charged with going after tax cheaters .\nBut the GOP says the IRS can do more and is choosing not to , instead paying employees bonuses \u2014 a sore spot for the GOP .\n\u201c They tell me they \u2019 re outraged they can only answer 53 percent of the calls ; I tell them I \u2019 m outraged they just paid [ millions ] in bonuses to people , some of them who owe back taxes \u2014 get your priorities right , \u201d Crenshaw said .\nHe was referring to recent bonuses the commissioner paid out to some IRS employees in hopes of improving employee morale and rewarding good work .\nKoskinen is likely to hear more remarks like these over the next year as the IRS is pushed to the brink to do more with what money it has . But as Koskinen said a few weeks ago , it won \u2019 t be pretty : \u201c As well as we can is still going to be miserable . \u201d",
