    "content": "I watched Monday 's presidential debate . But what I heard was different from what Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton seemed to say .\nWhen Clinton said , `` I want us to invest in you , '' what I heard was , `` I will spend your money better than you will . '' Also , I heard , `` I will spend lots of your money ! ''\nWhen Trump said our economic problems are China 's fault , what I heard was , `` Blaming China wins me votes . ''\nWhen Clinton told Trump , `` My father\u2026 printed drapery fabrics , '' what I heard was , `` Donald , you are a spoiled rich kid . ''\nWhen Trump replied , `` My father gave me a very small loan , '' I heard Trump saying , `` Anything less than $ 200 million is a pittance . '' ( It 's actually not clear what Trump received from his dad . Trump claims it was $ 1 million ; others say $ 200 million . Anyway , is a million dollars a `` small '' loan '' ? )\nWhen Clinton said , `` I 'm going to have a special prosecutor\u2026 to enforce the trade deals we have , '' I heard , `` Kiss my ring and pay my foundation if you want your trade deal approved ! ''\nWhen Trump said President Obama has `` doubled '' our debt , I swear I heard Trump promise , `` I 'll triple it ! ''\nWhen Clinton said , `` I think it 's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share , '' what I heard was , `` Good thing Bill and I are 'broke , ' because we 're going to soak the rich like they 've never been soaked before . ''\nWhen Clinton said Trump 's taxes `` must be something really important , even terrible , that he 's trying to hide , '' what I heard was , `` My emails , on the other hand , were just a minor mistake and nothing I 'm trying to hide\u2014next question ? ''\nWhen Trump said , `` I was the one that got ( Obama ) to produce the birth certificate , and I think I did a good job , '' what I heard was , `` Since Hillary and her staff spread the lie first , I 'm blameless . ''\nWhen Clinton said , `` Barack Obama is a man of great dignity , '' I swear I heard her add quietly , `` despite me smearing him in 2008 . ''\nWhen Trump said , `` I was just endorsed ( by 200 ) admirals and generals , '' what I heard was , `` I wish members of the military supported me the way they support Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson . ''\nWhen Clinton said , `` Putin is playing a tough long game here , '' I swear I heard Hillary say , `` I guess my 'reset ' with Russia was a bad idea . ''\nWhen Clinton said she 'll `` do much more with our tech companies '' to fight ISIS , what I heard was , `` I 'll force Facebook and Twitter to shut down parts of the internet . ''\nWhen Clinton said she 'll `` take out al-Qaeda leadership , '' what I heard was , `` I do n't know exactly who they are , but I 'll kill a bunch of military-age males . ''\nWhen Trump said , `` I did not support the war in Iraq , '' what I heard was , `` \u2026 except when I did . ''\nWhen Clinton said , `` A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes , '' I heard , `` A man provoked by a tweet should not be near the nuclear codes . '' ( Clinton got some things right . )\nWhen Trump said , `` My strongest asset is my temperament , '' I heard viewers laughing .\nWhen Clinton complained that Trump `` said women do n't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men , '' I wondered , `` So Hillary believes that women should get equal pay even when they do n't do as good a job ? ''\nIf only there were some way both Clinton and Trump could lose . Oh , right\u2014there is ! Governor Gary Johnson 's in the race . But the most reliable predictor of future events\u2014the betting odds ( see ElectionBettingOdds.com ) \u2014does n't give him much of a chance . The bettors do n't give Donald Trump a great chance either . As I write , Clinton is favored 68.7 percent to 29.6 percent .\nDuring the debate , Trump 's odds dropped 5 percent . I did n't think he performed that badly , but I must be wrong . The bettors are generally right .\nWe may as well get used to hearing the title `` President Hillary Clinton . ''",
