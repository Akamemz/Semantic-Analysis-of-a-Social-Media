    "content": "Hundreds of key jobs across the federal government remain vacant as a result of an overworked White House personnel office that is frustrating Cabinet secretaries and hampering President Donald Trump \u2019 s ability to carry out his ambitious legislative agenda .\nThe process is bogged down as a result of micromanaging by the president and senior staff , turf wars between the West Wing and Cabinet secretaries and a largely inexperienced and overworked staff , say more than a dozen sources including administration insiders , lobbyists , lawyers and Republican strategists .\nTrump personally oversees the hiring process for agency staff by insisting on combing through a binder full of names each week and likes to sign off on each one , according to two people with knowledge of the administration \u2019 s hiring process . Also weighing in on the names \u2014 and not always agreeing on final picks \u2014 are leaders of sometimes warring factions , including chief of staff Reince Priebus , senior strategist Steve Bannon , Cabinet secretaries and , sometimes , the White House \u2019 s top lawyer , Don McGahn .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like a medieval court , \u201d said one person advising potential nominees through the confirmation process . \u201c The White House meets once a week to go over personnel in some attempt to create uniformity , but in this White House , you just have to smile at that . \u2026 It \u2019 s hard to impose uniformity among the White House \u2019 s different coalitions . \u201d\nThe only uniformity is that potential hires must show fealty to the president . One person close to the White House said a sense of \u201c paranoia \u201d has taken over amid fears that disloyal hires might undercut Trump \u2019 s agenda or leak to the press .\nAll of this adds up to unusual pressure on the White House Office of Presidential Personnel , which is charged with filling thousands of jobs throughout the federal government , according to former personnel staffers from the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush .\nThe top-heavy decision-making has put the Trump White House behind other West Wings in filling out the ranks of the federal government . Of the 553 key appointments that require Senate approval , the White House has formally nominated 24 people and 22 have been confirmed , according to data from the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service \u2014 to say nothing of the thousands of slots that do n't require confirmation .\nBy comparison , Obama had 54 people confirmed by April 7 ; Bush , 32 ; and Bill Clinton , 44 .\n\u201c Not having the people in the agency offices means it \u2019 s harder to do different or new things , \u201d said Clay Johnson , who ran the personnel office under Bush . \u201c If you want to keep on keeping on , the career staff can do that . \u201d\nThe White House disputes that its process is flawed and said the president weighs in only on Senate-confirmable positions .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t come with the same type of bench that other presidents come in with , \u201d said one senior White House official , referring to Trump \u2019 s lean campaign staff . \u201c We \u2019 re being more deliberative and selective to make sure our hires are in line with the president \u2019 s objectives .
