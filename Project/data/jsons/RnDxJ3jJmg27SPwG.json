Bush , Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan ahead of their first inaugurations .\nThat perception comes as majorities think Trump will achieve several of the goals outlined during his campaign as top priorities . Nearly three-quarters say Trump is likely to repeal and replace Obamacare , two-thirds think he will renegotiate NAFTA and 6 in 10 say he 'll create good-paying jobs in economically challenged areas .
