And the president has praised the UAE for the Persian Gulf nation \u2019 s efforts to work with the United States on economic issues and squashing terrorism in the region , thanking Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed for his efforts just last week , according to the White House .\nNader has purportedly been an adviser to the crown prince . Axios first reported that Mueller investigators were talking to Nader .\nMueller took over the Justice Department investigation in May 2017 .
