    "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday set up another showdown over President Obama \u2019 s health care law , agreeing to decide whether the government may force for-profit companies to insure birth control as part of their health plans , even if it violates the owners \u2019 religious beliefs .\nThe justices said they will hear appeals of two related cases \u2014 one in which the lower court ruled in favor of an employer , and one in which the lower court upheld the Obama administration \u2019 s contraception mandate . The conflicting rulings made it an easy decision for the justices to accept the cases .\n\u201c I really don \u2019 t think they had any alternative than to take this up , \u201d said Holly Lynch , a health policy and bioethics specialist at Harvard Law School .\nThe Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments and release its opinion before the end of its term in June . That decision would come just two years after the court , in a divided 5-4 ruling , upheld the law \u2019 s individual mandate as constitutional under Congress \u2019 taxing authority .\nIn all , nearly 40 companies filed suit over the mandate , with particular objections to insuring so-called morning-after contraception pills that they equate with abortion .
