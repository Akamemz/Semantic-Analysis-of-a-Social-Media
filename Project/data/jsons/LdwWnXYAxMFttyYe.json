He plans for it . He prepares . He pregames .\nUnlike you and me , however , Mr. Reef \u2019 s preparations don \u2019 t involve boning up on recipes or vacuuming the guest bedroom . What Mr. Reef is doing in advance of Thanksgiving is buying water heaters . Lots of them . He knows he \u2019 ll need them because he knows we \u2019 ll need them \u2013 more of us than would like . And Mr. Reef \u2019 s job will be to get them into emergency service before our visiting in-laws step into cold showers . Of course , those appliances will be the least of Mr. Reef \u2019 s Thanksgiving workload , because Mr. Reef is a plumber . And for plumbers , Thanksgiving is Armageddon .\n\u201c Actually , Thanksgiving Day itself starts a little slow , \u201d says Mr. Reef , a 20-year drain-service veteran in Colorado Springs , Colorado , \u201c but by noon things really start kicking off . And the afternoon and evening can be crazy . And then there \u2019 s Friday , our busiest day all year . It \u2019 s Black Friday to you . To us ? Make that \u2018 Brown Friday. \u2019 Sorry . But there are disasters . \u201d\n\u201c Well , you know the famous one about the turkey in the trap ? \u201d\nNot that kind of trap . Turns out he \u2019 s referring to \u201c a case out of Kansas City , \u201d which has become lore in the plumbing trade . Evidently a local firm was called to the home of an older woman because her toilet had jammed , and now there was the worst kind of flood . Not a problem , said the plumber in question , nothing we can \u2019 t handle .\nBut the typical handling didn \u2019 t work . The plungers , the mechanical snakes . The plumber deduced that something was stuck in the toilet \u2019 s trap \u2013 something big . So he removed the stool to access the trap ... and found an entire turkey carcass inside . ( \u201c Hard to do , \u201d noted Mr . Reef . ) The client had tried to flush her Thanksgiving remains down the toilet . \u201c Why did you do that ? \u201d asked the plumber when the excavation was done .\nMr. Reef hastens to point out that most of his challenges are more prosaic than that \u2013 your usual backups in sinks , sewer lines , and dishwashers . Plus those water heater breakdowns for which he stocks up . All of it the \u201c logical result \u201d of a holiday that \u2019 s like any other day , he says , only more so . More people , more food , more overload , more waste , more mistakes . ( We \u2019 ll come back to those mistakes . ) \u201c Thanksgiving is long , but that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re here for , all hands on deck , \u201d he says , in an almost relishing tone .\nBut let \u2019 s pause a moment to pay tribute to \u2013 nay , to give thanks for \u2013 the fact that he says it . Along with the fact that a lot of other people say it , too , while they spend Thanksgiving not at home but on the job . \u201c Nothing we can \u2019 t handle. \u201d Because without them , the Thanksgivings most of us enjoy might not quite be possible .\nOverstatement ? Surveys have shown that as many as 40 % of businesses require at least some employees to work on Thanksgiving . And though there are no good data for the exact number of people who clock in on that day , an Allstate/National Journal survey from 2014 revealed that fully 25 % of American workers are required to work on either Thanksgiving Day , Christmas Day , or New Year \u2019 s Day .\nWhen you stop to look around , it \u2019 s not hard to see the massive shadow workforce undergirding our Thanksgiving rituals of visiting and hosting and eating and celebrating . Much of the public sector stays lit \u2013 law enforcement , firefighters , utility departments , emergency crews . And so do airlines , bus services , freight shippers , railroads , and more and more retailers that open their stores not only on Black Friday but on Thanksgiving Day , as well .\nAlso doing business as usual or better : gas stations , gyms , convenience stores , media outlets ( somebody \u2019 s got ta comment on all that football ) , and restaurants . At the national restaurant chain Cracker Barrel , Thanksgiving Day is the busiest day of the year . Many Starbucks are open , of course . And so is Disney World .\nAnd then there is the entire health care industry , which hums steadily through every holiday but which registers a Thanksgiving-specific spike . Hospital emergency room visits on Thanksgiving have been reported to exceed the norm by 10 % in Lubbock , Texas ; by 12 % in New York ; and by 15 % in Kansas City . Causes ? People eat wrong , drink too much , sleep too little , and play far too much touch football while in something less than game shape . Lubbock ER doctor James Williams even attributed some of the patient uptick to the kickoff of Christmas-decorating season \u2013 the hanging of the lights , as he told an interviewer \u2013 a source of mishaps that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission confirms . The lesson , as always : We are not as good on ladders as we think .\nEvery one of those people \u2013 from the baggage handlers to the baristas to the busboys \u2013 help make our Thanksgivings possible . So here \u2019 s to them all . Maybe a little extra in the tip jar wouldn \u2019 t hurt .\nBut there \u2019 s making Thanksgiving possible , and there \u2019 s flat-out saving Thanksgiving \u2013 which means saving us from the two kinds of potential disasters that are dreaded above the rest , the kinds of disasters that threaten family comity , personal reputation , and emotional survival ( as well as one \u2019 s Instagram feed ) . They are when the drain won \u2019 t flow , and when the bird won \u2019 t cook .\nFor 15 years , the Roto-Rooter Services Co. \u2013 a national drain-cleaning chain headquartered in Cincinnati \u2013 has tracked customer demand . \u201c And on the Friday after Thanksgiving , business jumps 50 % , year after year without fail , \u201d says company spokesman Paul Abrams . \u201c Thanksgiving Day is busy , too , but people assume they \u2019 re going to pay through the nose on Thanksgiving \u2013 they \u2019 re wrong by the way , rates are the same \u2013 so they tough it out until the day after. \u201d Unless they have guests , in which case the cavalry can never come soon enough .\n\u201c But we \u2019 re just the back end of the process , \u201d says Mr. Reef . The front end \u2013 the very front end \u2013 is the food . \u201c And even us plumbers know , \u201d says Mr. Reef , \u201c that as bad as our disasters are , blowing the meal is worse . \u201d\nThankfully \u2013 are you noting a theme here ? \u2013 there are people who can save us from that particular disaster , too .\nIn a quiet corner of Naperville , Illinois , is a large , unremarkable office floor , \u201c about the size of a basketball court , \u201d that on Thanksgiving Day is the opposite of quiet . It is the home of the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line ( that \u2019 s 1-800-BUTTERBALL , to you ) , which for its 39th year will again come to our collective , last-second , meal-making rescue .\nThere are other cooking hotlines \u2013 from those by other turkey brands such as Jennie-O and Honeysuckle White , to ones addressing other menu niches ( the Crisco Pie & Baking Hotline , the Sara Lee Desserts Pie Hot\u00adline , the Ocean Spray Holiday Helpline ) . There \u2019 s a U.S. Department of Agriculture meat and poultry hotline putting our tax dollars to work . And there \u2019 s even an excellent quick-response Q & A forum on Food52 , the website launched by former New York Times Magazine food editor Amanda Hesser . \u201c This is our Super Bowl ! \u201d says Food52 executive Suzanne D \u2019 Amato about the hot\u00adline on Thanksgiving Day .\nBut Butterball is the grande dame . On Thanksgiving Day , 50 cooking advisers will work the phone lines ( and text screens and social media platforms ) , most of them talking at once . They \u2019 ll field more than 10,000 queries . Which surprises hotline director Nicole Johnson , since these days there \u2019 s no question the internet can \u2019 t answer .\nWhat doesn \u2019 t surprise any of the Butterball veterans are the problems that callers confront them with , since by now there are none they haven \u2019 t heard .\nQ : My turkey has no breast meat ! What do I do ?\nQ : My oven \u2019 s too small , so I used a hammer to shatter all the bones and crush the bird into a lump \u2013 that \u2019 s OK , right ?\nA : OK in theory . Just be careful carving . And don \u2019 t get your hopes up about presentation .\nQ : I sliced my bird in half with a chain saw \u2013 will the engine oil be a problem ?\nQ : I found a turkey in a freezer unopened since 1969 . Can I eat it ?\nQ : My bird barely fits inside my oven \u2013 will it rise too much for me to get it out ?\nQ : I forgot to remove the plastic shrink-wrap before I roasted it . What now ?\nQ : I scrubbed my raw turkey with a toothbrush dipped in bleach for three hours . Is that enough to kill the harmful bacteria ?\nBonus A : But if you eat it , it could kill you .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the No . 1 most often-asked question : How do I find out when my turkey is done ? The only acceptable answer : with a thermometer . You can \u2019 t tell if a turkey is done by looking at it . Or by twisting its leg . Butterball advises that a turkey is done when the thermometer reads 180 degrees Fahrenheit deep in the thigh , and 165 degrees in the center of the stuffing , if the turkey is stuffed .\nOr there \u2019 s the other most often-asked question : I forgot to thaw my turkey \u2013 how can I thaw it now ?\nA : For starters , not in a hot tub , or with a hair dryer , or in the bathtub with your twins , all of which have been tried more often than you \u2019 d imagine . ( \u201c People are a hoot ! \u201d a hotline veteran once delightedly told an interviewer . ) Butterball operatives cite the USDA recommendation : Soak the turkey , bagged , in cold water for 30 minutes per pound of bird , changing the water every 30 minutes as you go . All of which sounds like the best possible reason for remembering to do your thawing right in the first place , by giving your bird a day in the refrigerator for every 4 or 5 pounds of its weight .\nPhew . Are we poking fun ? No , we are not . On account of we live in a pretty glassy house ourselves . There was the year I decided to \u201c burnish \u201d our turkey by roasting it draped in a fat-soaked cheesecloth ( it was a thing , I \u2019 m telling you ) , only to annoy the neighbors with fire alarms and smoke that sent our visitors into the subfreezing yard .\nAnd the year I forgot to buy a roasting pan and had to fabricate one from tinfoil and cookie sheets ( another fail , more turkey drippings on the oven floor , more smoke ) . As well as the year when our own complaining sewer system resulted in a \u201c situation , \u201d as my then 8-year-old niece called it ; we and our houseguests spent half of Thanksgiving fervently watching two unfortunate drain pros interrogate our holding tank , their quilted coveralls and woolen balaclavas providing far too little protection against the unbroken Northwest wind . What had we done wrong ? I still don \u2019 t know . I \u2019 m not sure I want to .\n( But to both of those gentlemen , wherever they are : Thank you , more than I can say . )\nAs a public service , we should point out that the people who save Thanksgiving have thoughts about all this \u2013 countermeasures , let \u2019 s call them \u2013 which mostly amount to advice about how we can forestall our disasters in the first place ( before they become their disasters ) .\nEven Roto-Rooter , whose revenues rise with our troubles , doesn \u2019 t hesitate to educate about how to keep those troubles at bay . \u201c Funny thing , \u201d says Mr. Abrams , in the Cincinnati headquarters , \u201c at first we were afraid that sharing all the preventative info would undercut our business \u2013 but , nah , never happened . \u201d\nNowadays , locate any plumbing company that hosts a blog and you \u2019 ll find a treatise about how to avoid Thanksgiving disasters . Read enough of them , and they start to feel like a collective plea . Please don \u2019 t pour the turkey fat down the sink . Please keep an eye on those houseguests \u201c just trying to help \u201d with cleanup . Please , please , please don \u2019 t mistake your garbage disposal for a trash can . And don \u2019 t mistake your toilet for a garbage disposal , either , in case you need reminding . ( See above . )\nIn Rochester , Minnesota , Norm Autry tells us that although we should use a lot of running water when using the garbage disposal , \u201c running the faucet for 15 minutes does not rinse that pipe . A garbage disposal is an appliance of convenience , but if not used properly it will come back to bite you . \u201d\nIn Newfoundland , New Jersey , Mark Lindsay gets more specific : \u201c Pour any excess grease from turkey or roast pans into a disposable container and let it congeal ; then discard the container in the trash. \u201d Here \u2019 s his list of what not to put in your garbage disposal :\n\u2022 Celery , pumpkin or potato flesh , or other fibrous foods .\nAnd in Charlotte , North Carolina , Dave Parker reminds us that \u201c lots of guests means lots of flushing . Save your guests the embarrassment of asking for a plunger \u2013 just in case \u2013 and leave one in plain sight near the toilet . And consider a friendly-worded \u2018 do not flush \u2019 list as a reminder to guests ( baby wipes , Q-tips , floss ) . \u201d\nThe cooking advisers are a little less desperately prescriptive . ( Except , really , get that turkey out of the freezer and into the fridge on Saturday , not Thursday , we \u2019 re begging you . ) Most of the advice about disaster avoidance in the kitchen might be summarized like this : Don \u2019 t experiment . Just don \u2019 t . Thanksgiving is not the moment to try fat-basted cheesecloth on your bird to prevent it from drying out . Or to top that side dish of portobellos with some new recipe \u2019 s suggestion of pepper , paprika , and cayenne . And do not decide that you \u2019 ve fallen in love with the word \u201c spatchcock \u201d and that this is the day to make it happen . Put down the cleaver . This is not that day .\nAll good advice , no ? Of course we won \u2019 t follow it . Or many of us won \u2019 t , at least . Sure , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , but this is America . Live now , fix later .\nSo the people who save Thanksgiving for us will have to keep saving it .\nWhich , for them , isn \u2019 t all bad . As Roto-Rooter \u2019 s Mr. Abrams doesn \u2019 t hesitate to note , \u201c A plumber can make a lot of money on Thanksgiving . \u201d\nMoney \u2019 s good . Given the price they pay to get it , though \u2013 the lost family time , the disastrous conditions ( literally ) , the obliteration of other things that go along with Thanksgivings \u2013 it \u2019 s a good thing that the people sacrificing their own holidays in order to rescue ours get something else , too . Something better .\n\u201c Oftentimes , \u201d reflects Mr. Reef , the water heater stockpiler , \u201c being a plumber is pretty thankless , I won \u2019 t lie . But not on Thanksgiving. \u201d Doesn \u2019 t matter how long the hours are , or how frustrating the challenges , or how severely you suffer from an entirely understandable case of \u201c FOMO \u201d ( fear of missing out ) , he says , \u201c Thanksgiving is rewarding . People are so , so happy to see you when you show up .\nAnd if that \u2019 s not enough , you get to feel connected , too . \u201c It \u2019 s the day you get to really feel those intimate relationships with customers that we miss on a day-to-day basis , \u201d Mr. Reef says .\nSays Food52 \u2019 s Ms. D \u2019 Amato , of her company \u2019 s all-staff effort to answer any posted query in 10 minutes or less : \u201c It \u2019 s all hands on deck , but it \u2019 s fun , too . Everyone at Food52 comes together to make this a really special experience for our community . ... It \u2019 s full-on , but it \u2019 s also so rewarding to help people and be there for them. \u201d The secret sauce , though , isn \u2019 t always the advice , she says . \u201c It \u2019 s about just supporting people and easing their anxieties : \u2018 So your meal may not turn out perfect \u2013 it \u2019 s OK ! Mine may not either. \u2019 It \u2019 s about being in it together . \u201d\nAt Butterball , too , it \u2019 s not the goofy questions that the staffers like to talk about the most . It \u2019 s the feeling of being there on a day when things are happening that might be remembered forever : when someone who has just lost a lifelong partner now has to cook alone and doesn \u2019 t know how ; when young newlyweds are nervously hosting their first Thanksgiving and can \u2019 t figure out the gravy ; when recent immigrants reach out because they so want to get this new tradition \u2013 their new tradition \u2013 exactly right .\nIt \u2019 s the feeling of being in service . And anyway , what \u2019 s better \u2013 to receive gifts , or to have them to give ?\n\u201c Honestly , \u201d says Mr. Reef , \u201c holidays really do bring out the best in people. \u201d The work is hard , sure , but what a difference you can make . What gratitude you \u2019 re met with . \u201c And the food ! People are so relieved and happy , they keep feeding you at every stop . And the food is so great !\n\u201c Only thing is , \u201d he says , \u201c by the end of the day you \u2019 re too full to eat a Thanksgiving meal of your own . \u201d\nBut don \u2019 t worry , he adds , starting to laugh . \u201c It \u2019 s nothing we can \u2019 t handle . \u201d",

The only acceptable answer: with a thermometer. You can\u2019t tell if a turkey is done by looking at it. Or by twisting its leg. Butterball advises that a turkey is done when the thermometer reads 180 degrees Fahrenheit deep in the thigh, and 165 degrees in the center of the stuffing, if the turkey is stuffed.\n\nOr there\u2019s the other most often-asked question: I forgot to thaw my turkey \u2013 how can I thaw it now?\n\nA: For starters, not in a hot tub, or with a hair dryer, or in the bathtub with your twins, all of which have been tried more often than you\u2019d imagine. (\u201cPeople are a hoot!\u201d a hotline veteran once delightedly told an interviewer.) Butterball operatives cite the USDA recommendation: Soak the turkey, bagged, in cold water for 30 minutes per pound of bird, changing the water every 30 minutes as you go. All of which sounds like the best possible reason for remembering to do your thawing right in the first place, by giving your bird a day in the refrigerator for every 4 or 5 pounds of its weight.\n\nKaren Norris/Staff\n\nPhew. Are we poking fun? No, we are not. On account of we live in a pretty glassy house ourselves. There was the year I decided to \u201cburnish\u201d our turkey by roasting it draped in a fat-soaked cheesecloth (it was a thing, I\u2019m telling you), only to annoy the neighbors with fire alarms and smoke that sent our visitors into the subfreezing yard.\n\nAnd the year I forgot to buy a roasting pan and had to fabricate one from tinfoil and cookie sheets (another fail, more turkey drippings on the oven floor, more smoke). As well as the year when our own complaining sewer system resulted in a \u201csituation,\u201d as my then 8-year-old niece called it; we and our houseguests spent half of Thanksgiving fervently watching two unfortunate drain pros interrogate our holding tank, their quilted coveralls and woolen balaclavas providing far too little protection against the unbroken Northwest wind. What had we done wrong? I still don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure I want to.\n\n(But to both of those gentlemen, wherever they are: Thank you, more than I can say.)\n\nDodging disaster\n\nAs a public service, we should point out that the people who save Thanksgiving have thoughts about all this \u2013 countermeasures, let\u2019s call them \u2013 which mostly amount to advice about how we can forestall our disasters in the first place (before they become their disasters).\n\nEven Roto-Rooter, whose revenues rise with our troubles, doesn\u2019t hesitate to educate about how to keep those troubles at bay. \u201cFunny thing,\u201d says Mr. Abrams, in the Cincinnati headquarters, \u201cat first we were afraid that sharing all the preventative info would undercut our business \u2013 but, nah, never happened.\u201d\n\nNowadays, locate any plumbing company that hosts a blog and you\u2019ll find a treatise about how to avoid Thanksgiving disasters. Read enough of them, and they start to feel like a collective plea. Please don\u2019t pour the turkey fat down the sink. Please keep an eye on those houseguests \u201cjust trying to help\u201d with cleanup. Please, please, please don\u2019t mistake your garbage disposal for a trash can. And don\u2019t mistake your toilet for a garbage disposal, either, in case you need reminding. (See above.)\n\nIn Rochester, Minnesota, Norm Autry tells us that although we should use a lot of running water when using the garbage disposal, \u201crunning the faucet for 15 minutes does not rinse that pipe. A garbage disposal is an appliance of convenience, but if not used properly it will come back to bite you.\u201d\n\nIn Newfoundland, New Jersey, Mark Lindsay gets more specific: \u201cPour any excess grease from turkey or roast pans into a disposable container and let it congeal; then discard the container in the trash.\u201d Here\u2019s his list of what not to put in your garbage disposal:\n\n\u2022 Bones.\n\n\u2022 Celery, pumpkin or potato flesh, or other fibrous foods.\n\n\u2022 Coffee grounds.\n\n\u2022 Eggshells.\n\n\u2022 Fruit pits.\n\n\u2022 Pasta.\n\n\u2022 GREASE (capital letters, his).\n\nAnd in Charlotte, North Carolina, Dave Parker reminds us that \u201clots of guests means lots of flushing. Save your guests the embarrassment of asking for a plunger \u2013 just in case \u2013 and leave one in plain sight near the toilet. And consider a friendly-worded \u2018do not flush\u2019 list as a reminder to guests (baby wipes, Q-tips, floss).\u201d\n\nThe cooking advisers are a little less desperately prescriptive. (Except, really, get that turkey out of the freezer and into the fridge on Saturday, not Thursday, we\u2019re begging you.) Most of the advice about disaster avoidance in the kitchen might be summarized like this: Don\u2019t experiment. Just don\u2019t. Thanksgiving is not the moment to try fat-basted cheesecloth on your bird to prevent it from drying out. Or to top that side dish of portobellos with some new recipe\u2019s suggestion of pepper, paprika, and cayenne. And do not decide that you\u2019ve fallen in love with the word \u201cspatchcock\u201d and that this is the day to make it happen. Put down the cleaver. This is not that day.\n\nAll good advice, no? Of course we won\u2019t follow it. Or many of us won\u2019t, at least. Sure, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, but this is America. Live now, fix later.\n\nSo the people who save Thanksgiving for us will have to keep saving it.\n\nWhich, for them, isn\u2019t all bad. As Roto-Rooter\u2019s Mr. Abrams doesn\u2019t hesitate to note, \u201cA plumber can make a lot of money on Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nMoney\u2019s good. Given the price they pay to get it, though \u2013 the lost family time, the disastrous conditions (literally), the obliteration of other things that go along with Thanksgivings \u2013 it\u2019s a good thing that the people sacrificing their own holidays in order to rescue ours get something else, too. Something better.\n\n\u201cYou get to be the hero\u201d\n\n\u201cOftentimes,\u201d reflects Mr. Reef, the water heater stockpiler, \u201cbeing a plumber is pretty thankless, I won\u2019t lie. But not on Thanksgiving.\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter how long the hours are, or how frustrating the challenges, or how severely you suffer from an entirely understandable case of \u201cFOMO\u201d (fear of missing out), he says, \u201cThanksgiving is rewarding. People are so, so happy to see you when you show up.\n\n\u201cOn Thanksgiving, you get to be the hero.\u201d\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, you get to feel connected, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the day you get to really feel those intimate relationships with customers that we miss on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Mr. Reef says.\n\nSays Food52\u2019s Ms. D\u2019Amato, of her company\u2019s all-staff effort to answer any posted query in 10 minutes or less: \u201cIt\u2019s all hands on deck, but it\u2019s fun, too. Everyone at Food52 comes together to make this a really special experience for our community. ... It\u2019s full-on, but it\u2019s also so rewarding to help people and be there for them.\u201d The secret sauce, though, isn\u2019t always the advice, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about just supporting people and easing their anxieties: \u2018So your meal may not turn out perfect \u2013 it\u2019s OK! Mine may not either.\u2019 It\u2019s about being in it together.\u201d\n\nAt Butterball, too, it\u2019s not the goofy questions that the staffers like to talk about the most. It\u2019s the feeling of being there on a day when things are happening that might be remembered forever: when someone who has just lost a lifelong partner now has to cook alone and doesn\u2019t know how; when young newlyweds are nervously hosting their first Thanksgiving and can\u2019t figure out the gravy; when recent immigrants reach out because they so want to get this new tradition \u2013 their new tradition \u2013 exactly right.\n\nIt\u2019s the feeling of being in service. And anyway, what\u2019s better \u2013 to receive gifts, or to have them to give?\n\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d says Mr. Reef, \u201cholidays really do bring out the best in people.\u201d The work is hard, sure, but what a difference you can make. What gratitude you\u2019re met with. \u201cAnd the food! People are so relieved and happy, they keep feeding you at every stop. And the food is so great!\n\n\u201cOnly thing is,\u201d he says, \u201cby the end of the day you\u2019re too full to eat a Thanksgiving meal of your own.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, he adds, starting to laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t handle.\u201d",
