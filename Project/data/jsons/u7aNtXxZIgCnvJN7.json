( Erin Scott/Reuters )\nTo the extent that I care at all about Israel blocking entry to two U.S. congresswomen who partner with anti-Semites who seek its destruction , I agree with critics who argue that Bibi Netanyahu should not appear to bow to Donald Trump \u2019 s tweeted demands and that blocking Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar from visiting Israel handed them a short-term propaganda victory . But that \u2019 s not the most important part of the story .\nThe most important element of the story is the fact that two American congresswomen shunned a bipartisan congressional delegation to Israel to go on an independent trip to Israel sponsored by vicious anti-Semites . Another important element of the story is that , as of today , the mainstream media have whitewashed Omar and Tlaib \u2019 s vile associations .\nWriting yesterday , the Washington Post said that \u201c Omar and Tlaib \u2019 s trip to Jerusalem and the West Bank was planned by Miftah , a nonprofit organization headed by Palestinian lawmaker and longtime peace negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. \u201d The New York Times described it as an organization \u201c headed by a longtime Palestinian lawmaker. \u201d In its editorial , the New York Times editorial board identified it as a group \u201c that promotes \u2018 global awareness and knowledge of Palestinian realities . \u2019 \u201d\nThis is a whitewash . Thanks to a Twitter thread from the Washington Examiner \u2019 s Seth Mandel \u2014 who pointed to multiple additional sources \u2014 I started looking at the articles and views published on the Miftah website , and it was like peeling an onion of evil . There was layer upon layer of vile anti-Semitism .\nFirst , the group actually published blood libel , posting an article that accused \u201c the Jews [ of using ] the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover. \u201d When pro-Israel bloggers condemned the article , Miftah first claimed that the attacks against the piece were part of a \u201c smear campaign \u201d and minimized the reference to blood libel as merely \u201c briefly addressed . \u201d\nIt was just a light sprinkling of blood libel . Move along , nothing to see here .\nThe organization later issued a more complete apology , but we \u2019 ve barely gotten started with this vile group . It \u2019 s also published an American neo-Nazi treatise called \u201c Who Rules America : The Alien Grip on Our News and Entertainment Media Must Be Broken \u201d ( archived here ) .\nAs Vox \u2019 s Jane Coaston explained , \u201c the original source was National Vanguard , a neo-Nazi group founded in 2005 in Charlottesville by members of the National Alliance. \u201d The National Alliance \u201c was for a time the best financed and best organized white nationalist group in America. \u201d And to give you a sense of its ideology , here are two paragraphs from the treatise :\nThe Jew-controlled entertainment media have taken the lead in persuading a whole generation that homosexuality is a normal and acceptable way of life ; that there is nothing at all wrong with White women dating or marrying Black men , or with White men marrying Asian women ; that all races are inherently equal in ability and character \u2014 except that the character of the White race is suspect because of a history of oppressing other races ; and that any effort by Whites at racial self-preservation is reprehensible . We must oppose the further spreading of this poison among our people , and we must break the power of those who are spreading it . It would be intolerable for such power to be in the hands of any alien minority , with values and interests different from our own . But to permit the Jews , with their 3,000-year history of nation-wrecking , from ancient Egypt to Russia , to hold such power over us is tantamount to race suicide . Indeed , the fact that so many White Americans today are so filled with a sense of racial guilt and self-hatred that they actively seek the death of their own race is a deliberate consequence of Jewish media control .\nI look forward to hearing apologists argue that these statements are merely critiques of \u201c Israeli policies . \u201d\nBut that \u2019 s not all , not by a long shot . The group celebrates terrorists , including an evil woman who helped murder 13 Israeli children . In an article titled \u201c Let Us Honor Our Own , \u201d a Miftah contributor describes Dalal Al Mughrabi as \u201c a Palestinian fighter who was killed during a military operation against Israel in 1978 \u201d and as one of the Palestinian people \u2019 s \u201c national heroes . \u201d\nThe so-called \u201c military operation \u201d is more widely known as the \u201c Coastal Road Massacre , \u201d a bus hijacking that resulted in the deaths of 38 Israeli civilians , including 13 children .\nAl Mughrabi is hardly the only terrorist Miftah celebrates .
