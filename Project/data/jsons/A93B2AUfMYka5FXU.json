Terrorists intentionally hide in hard-to-reach locales and putting boots on the ground is often out of the question , he said .\nThus , when the United States is faced with a threat from terrorists in a country where the government has only tenuous or no influence , drones strikes are the only option -- and they 're legal because America `` is at war with al Qaeda , the Taliban and their associated forces , '' Obama said .\nHe added , however , `` To say a military tactic is legal , or even effective , is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance . For the same progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it . ''\nIncreased oversight is important , but not easy , Obama said . While he has considered a special court or independent oversight board , those options are problematic , so he plans to talk with Congress to determine how best to handle the deployment of drones , he said .\nThe nation 's image was a theme throughout the speech , as Obama emphasized some actions in recent years -- drone strikes and Guantanamo Bay key among them -- risk creating more threats . The nature of threats against the United States have changed since he took office -- they 've become more localized -- and so , too , must efforts to combat them , he said .\nJUST WATCHED Pres .

And al Qaeda 's ideology helped fuel attacks like the ones at the Boston Marathon and U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi .\nObama said the use of lethal force extends to U.S. citizens as well .\nOn Wednesday , his administration disclosed for the first time that four Americans had been killed in counterterrorist drone strikes overseas , including one person who was targeted by the United States .\n`` When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America -- and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens ; and when neither the United States , nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team , '' Obama said .\nTo stop terrorists from gaining a foothold , drones will be deployed , Obama said , but only when there is an imminent threat ; no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist ; `` near certainty '' that civilians wo n't be harmed ; and `` there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat . '' Never will a strike be punitive , he said .\nThose who die as collateral damage `` will haunt us for as long as we live , '' the president said , but he emphasized that the targeted individuals aim to exact indiscriminate violence , `` and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes . ''\nIt 's not always feasible to send in Special Forces , as in the Osama bin Laden raid , to stamp out terrorism , and even if it were , the introduction of troops could mean more deaths on both sides , Obama said .\n`` The result would be more U.S. deaths , more Blackhawks down , more confrontations with local populations and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars , '' he said .\nThe American public is split on where and how drones should be used , according to a March poll by Gallup .\nAlthough 65 % of respondents said drones should be used against suspected terrorists abroad , only 41 % said drones should be used against American citizens who are suspected terrorists in foreign countries .\nGuantanamo Bay also threatens to create new enemies of the state and diminish the country 's moral standing in the world , Obama said , revisiting a campaign promise he made before his first term .\n`` The original premise for opening Gitmo -- that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention -- was found unconstitutional five years ago , '' he said . `` In the meantime , Gitmo has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law . ''\nBecause of what Gitmo represents , some allies are reluctant to cooperate on investigations with the United States if a suspect might land at the controversial detention center , Obama said .\nThat 's not to mention the economic implications , the president said . The country spends $ 150 million annually to imprison 166 suspects , and the Defense Department estimates that keeping Gitmo open may cost another $ 200 million `` at a time when we are cutting investments in education and research here at home , '' he said .\nExplaining that no prisoner has ever escaped a supermax or military facility -- and noting U.S. courts have had no issue prosecuting terrorists , some more dangerous than those at Guantanamo -- Obama said he would push again to close the detention center and appoint State and Defense department envoys to make sure the detainees are transferred to other countries .\nSeventy percent of respondents to a February 2012 ABC/Washington Post poll said they approve of keeping the facility open for suspected terrorists . Only 24 % said it should be closed .\nOne of his initiatives aims to lift a moratorium on transferring prisoners to Yemen , long a volatile land but now ruled by a government regarded by the United States as a `` willing and able partner . '' Yemenis make up a significant portion of Guantanamo inmates .\nIn a statement issued through its embassy in Washington , Yemen 's government welcomed the U.S. decision and vowed to `` work with the United States to take all necessary steps to ensure the safe return of its detainees and will continue working towards their gradual rehabilitation and integration back into society . ''\nObama said he will insist on judicial review from every Guantanamo detainee , and when it 's appropriate , terrorists will be transferred stateside to stand trial in courts and `` our military justice system . ''\n`` Given my administration 's relentless pursuit of al Qaeda 's leadership , there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should never have been opened , '' the president said .\nThere are 86 inmates at Guantanamo who have been cleared for transfer , 56 of them from Yemen .\nWhile Obama worked to close Guantanamo early in his first term , Congress enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical .\nThis year , the State Department reassigned the special envoy who had been tasked in 2009 with closing the facility and lowered the post 's profile by assigning the job to the department 's legal adviser 's office .\nThe problem has been exacerbated by the fact more than half the facility 's inmates engaging in various forms of hunger strike , more than 20 of them being force-fed .\nObama made the case that the al Qaeda terror network in the Afghan and Pakistan region has been weakened but that new dangers have emerged as the U.S. winds down operations in Afghanistan after more than a decade of war triggered by the 9/11 attacks .\nThreats that have emerged come from al Qaeda affiliates , localized extremist groups and homegrown terrorists , like the two men suspected of attacking the Boston Marathon last month .\nThe administration has been considering shifting control of lethal drone operations from the CIA to the military . One senior administration official said the `` military is the appropriate agency to use force , '' not to rule out the range of options needed to deal with threats .\nBy law , the military is not able to act in the covert way the CIA can in this particular arena and must answer to Congress .\nIn his confirmation hearing for CIA director , John Brennan expressed a desire to move the agency away from paramilitary operations and back to traditional areas of espionage .\n`` The CIA should not be doing traditional military activities and operations , '' he said .\nObama rejected the idea of a global war on terror in favor of a more focused approach that will engage on specific networks of extremists who threaten the United States .\nThe administration plans to avoid operations that will cause civilian casualties and wants to work with partners in its operations .\nUse of force will be part of a larger strategy to deal with instability and hostility . Obama discussed strategies for promoting democratic governance and economic development and fostering U.S. engagement around the world .\nThe president also raised the unpopular topic of foreign aid , presenting it not as charity but as a means of national security . It amounts to less than 1 % of the national a budget but is integral to fighting terrorism , he said .\n`` For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height of the war , we could be training security forces in Libya , maintaining peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors , feeding the hungry in Yemen , building schools in Pakistan , and creating reservoirs of goodwill that marginalize extremists , '' he said .\nRep. Michael McCaul , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , criticized the idea of closing the Guantanamo Bay prison and said , `` The president 's policies signal a retreat from the threat of al Qaeda . ''\n`` The Obama administration 's return to a pre-9/11 counterterrorism mindset puts American lives at risk , '' the Texas Republican said . `` This war will continue whether the president acknowledges it or not . ''\nSen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia said that announcing plans to close the facility `` sends the message to ... detainees that if they harass the dedicated military personnel there enough , we will give in and send them home , even to Yemen . ''\n`` The president 's speech today will be viewed by terrorists as a victory , '' Chambliss said .\nBut at least one Republican , Sen. John McCain , pledged that he 'd work with Obama and his administration .\n`` In light of the president 's speech today , we will pledge our willingness to work with ( Obama ) to see that Guantanamo Bay is closed , '' said the Arizona Republican .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union 's leader -- even as he cheered plans to close the Guantanamo prison and allow for more oversight on drone strikes -- criticized `` still insufficient transparency '' regarding drones , what he called `` unconstitutional military commissions '' and the lack of what he 'd call a `` clear plan '' to end `` indefinite detention . ''\n`` President Obama 's efforts to repair his legacy in the eyes of future historians will require that he continue to double down if he is to fully restore this nation 's standing at home and abroad , '' Anthony Romero said in a statement .",
