    "content": "With the recent budget vote , Washington has decided to spend an additional $ 300 billion over the next two years , on top of the $ 1 trillion that we \u2019 ve just tacked on to the national debt with the recent tax cuts . Congress also decided to put off dealing with the budget again until March 2019 . Thanks to this decision , whatever economic gains we may experience since the passage of the tax cuts are at risk over the long-term . A debate is needed , if the country is to have a chance at sustainable , widespread economic growth . We must decide very soon on whether we seek to be the America of relatively low taxes , reasonable regulation , and fiscal responsibility , or if we want to be another Europe . I shudder at what the American peoples \u2019 choice will be .\nThe GOP says that its ultimate goal is to get sustainable , high levels of economic growth over the long-term . Unfortunately , that means that there \u2019 s still more spending to be done . Republicans believe that tax cuts and regulatory reform will negate the need for spending reductions because the first two policies will ignite the economy , allowing for economic growth to outpace debt creation ( and the larger growth would also mean the more money that companies and citizens paid to the government in taxes without an actual tax increase ) .\nRepublicans say this was precisely what happened during the Reagan boom . The GOP is correct . And , to be sure , if we want to create sustainable growth levels in the long-term , an infrastructure bill ( that would anticipate future growth ) coupled with greater investment into education ( that would help to create the workforce of tomorrow ) are both necessary .\nHowever , unlike the Reagan boom , the country \u2019 s debt levels have never been this high . Further , for every penny we want to spend on things that would actually create sustainable economic growth ( like tax cuts , infrastructure , and education ) , the bulk of that which America is deficit spending on are things that will in no way contribute to economic growth .\nThink about it : the largest cohort yet of Baby Boomers is set to retire around 2020\u2014placing immense strain on the already-overburdened Social Security Trust Fund .
