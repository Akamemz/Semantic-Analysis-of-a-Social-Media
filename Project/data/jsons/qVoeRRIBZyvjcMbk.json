    "content": "Climate change , by nature , is a global problem . Each ton of carbon dioxide affects the climate , whether emitted in Stockholm or Shanghai . At the heart of the Paris Agreement in 2015 is a bargain among nations to nudge one another toward ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions in an effort to stabilize global temperatures . The bargain also called on rich nations to help developing ones adapt . Now comes a test of the \u201c we \u2019 re in this together \u201d spirit . At the COP24 , this year \u2019 s United Nations climate summit , a key task is to firm up plans for developed nations to contribute more than $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to help other countries . \u201c [ The developed world ] has to take historical responsibility for this , \u201d says Nigerian climate official Peter Tarfa , noting the outsize emissions of industrialized nations . But the rationale is also pragmatic . More support translates into lower emissions in places with rising populations and aspirations for middle-class lifestyles . \u201c It \u2019 s not a question of forcing developed countries to pay , \u201d Dr. Tarfa says . It \u2019 s getting them \u201c to see the benefits of such action . \u201d\nIn 2015 , the Paris Agreement on climate change rallied the world \u2019 s nations around a sense of collective resolve , a spirit of \u201c We \u2019 re all in this together . \u201d\nLeaders embraced the idea that this global-scale problem requires ambitious action from every nation to cut greenhouse-gas emissions . They also agreed that wealthier nations should help finance the efforts of poorer ones .\nSome of that money has already started to flow . But a key moment has arrived . Three years later , it \u2019 s the appointed time to firm up plans to hit a $ 100-billion-a-year target for such international transfers by 2020 \u2013 and to expand this \u201c climate finance \u201d further from there .\nThe national and global initiatives are intertwined . Without help , developing nations will be less able to pursue ambitious targets for low-carbon economies . Officials from postcolonial and developing nations in the \u201c global south \u201d say industrialized nations should bring more money to the table \u2013 for everyone \u2019 s sake .\n\u201c If developed economies put off their climate payments any longer , the Paris Agreement temperature goals will slip out of reach , with tragic consequences for people and planet , '' J. Ant\u00f4nio Marcondes , chief negotiator for Brazil , writes in an email to the Monitor . \u201c These finance commitments were not mere ornaments to the Paris Agreement . They were fundamental elements in the balance of the Agreement which must be fully delivered for developed countries to meet their historical responsibilities , and for developing countries to reach an even higher gear . \u201d\nA higher gear may be vital . The outlook appears daunting on several fronts .\nThis week came news that , despite global efforts to date , the world \u2019 s greenhouse emissions continue to rise , driven especially by increases in China and India . Meanwhile , the United States under President Trump has backed away from its Paris climate commitments , and recent protests prompted the French government to cancel a gas tax designed to curb reliance on fossil fuels .\nStill , with all the challenges there \u2019 s also hope and a tangible sense of determined optimism in Katowice , Poland , at the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , known for short as COP24 . The ethos of \u201c we \u2019 re in this together \u201d hasn \u2019 t died out .\n\u201c The expected commitments that we \u2019 re hearing from developed countries are all positive , \u201d says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz , director of sustainable finance at the World Resources Institute think tank , speaking by phone from Poland . \u201c We do n't know yet what the numbers are going to be precisely , but we do know that there \u2019 s a collective sense that this has to be done . \u201d\nHe notes that , ahead of the summit for climate officials , Germany said it will contribute $ 1.7 billion to the Green Climate Fund for developing nations , nearly twice the support it gave the last time industrialized nations replenished that fund . That would push Germany toward the top tier of contributors , on a per capita basis .\nAnd the World Bank pledged this week to devote $ 200 billion over five years to help poorer nations develop their economies in climate-smart ways .\nTo some degree the Green Climate Fund is still earning the trust of donor and recipient nations alike . Some see room for the fund to make decisions both faster and with enhanced safeguards against misuse of the money .\nStill , there \u2019 s fairly wide support for the general concept behind the Green Climate Fund . The reasons voiced by officials and nongovernment organizations are both moral and pragmatic .\n\u201c The emissions come mostly from developed countries . If you look at the emissions produced by a small island in the Pacific , it 's almost zero , but the country can disappear because of rising sea levels , \u201d says Simon Wilson , head of communications at the Green Climate Fund .\n\u201c [ The developed world ] has to take historical responsibility for this , \u201d says Peter Tarfa , director of Nigeria \u2019 s Department of Climate Change .\nBut Mr. Wilson also notes the business opportunities for private-sector firms . And Dr. Tarfa also frames the the issue more broadly .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a question of forcing developed countries to pay , it \u2019 s a question of getting developed countries to see the benefits of such action and meeting their obligations , \u201d Tarfa says . Reduced emissions bring a benefit to the whole planet . And helping nations adapt to the effects of climate change can mean a reduction in conflict and forced migration .\nAkintunde Akinleye/Reuters/File A power official works on an electric pole along a street in Lagos , Nigeria 's commercial capital . Nigerian officials say that Green Climate Fund support will help the country to diversify energy sources to include more renewables as it moves to expand electricity access .\nNations like Nigeria don \u2019 t expect richer nations to pay for all their climate responses . But the needs are significant , and with aid they can do more .\n\u201c In Nigeria one of the major challenges is access to electricity . We would like to have more investments in clean sources of energy , \u201d Tarfa says . \u201c We also need environmentally friendly and affordable buildings , because the population is increasing dramatically . Other issues are clean transport and smart agriculture to maximize harvest . \u201d\nEach ton of carbon dioxide affects the global climate whether it was emitted in Stockholm or Shanghai .

For what kinds of investments ?\n\u201c We look at China , we think , \u2018 Oh they have all this money. \u2019 ... It \u2019 s kind of going through the Industrial Revolution on steroids , \u201d says Kate Gordon , an Oakland-based expert with Columbia University \u2019 s Center on Global Energy Policy . \u201c Sometimes we forget the scale of the challenge they \u2019 re facing to try to grow a middle class and grow a developed-country economy in a sustainable way . \u201d\nShe says \u201c the scale of doing that in China and India and other countries is bigger than the amount of money that they have to deal with it . \u201d\nEven when the general need is acknowledged , part of the challenge is building developed-nation commitment to climate finance .\nIn France , the recent protests by yellow-vested citizens revolved around a fuel tax with revenue going toward deficit reduction , leaving working-class citizens feeling penalized by a new burden on their finances .
