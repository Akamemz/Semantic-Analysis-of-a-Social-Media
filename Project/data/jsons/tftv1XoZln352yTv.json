A transcript of the surreal exchange makes plain the reason for divergent interpretations of Trump\u2019s words:\n\nHugh Hewitt: Last night, you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.\n\nDonald Trump: No, I meant he\u2019s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.\n\nHewitt: But he\u2019s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He\u2019s trying to kill them.\n\nTrump: I don\u2019t care. He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okay?\n\nHewitt: Well, that, you know, I have a saying, Donald Trump, the mnemonic device I use is Every Liberal Really Seems So, So Sad.

I give him the most valuable player award. And I give it to him, and I give it to, I gave the co-founder to Hillary. I don\u2019t know if you heard that.\n\nHewitt: I did. I did. I played it.\n\nTrump: I gave her the co-founder.\n\nHewitt: I know what you\u2019re arguing\u2026\n\nTrump: You\u2019re not, and let me ask you, do you not like that?\n\nHewitt: I don\u2019t. I think I would say they created, they lost the peace. They created the Libyan vacuum, they created the vacuum into which ISIS came, but they didn\u2019t create ISIS. That\u2019s what I would say.\n\nTrump: Well, I disagree.\n\nHewitt: All right, that\u2019s okay.\n\nTrump: I mean, with his bad policies, that\u2019s why ISIS came about.\n\nHewitt: That\u2019s\u2026\n\nTrump: If he would have done things properly, you wouldn\u2019t have had ISIS.\n\nHewitt: That\u2019s true.\n\nTrump: Therefore, he was the founder of ISIS.\n\nHewitt: And that\u2019s, I\u2019d just use different language to communicate it, but let me close with this, because I know I\u2019m keeping you long, and Hope\u2019s going to kill me.\n\nTrump: But they wouldn\u2019t talk about your language, and they do talk about my language, right?\n\nHewitt: Well, good point.
