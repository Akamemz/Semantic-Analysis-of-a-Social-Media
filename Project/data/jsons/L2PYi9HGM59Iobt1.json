    "content": "People who are likely to vote in the Nov. 4 midterm elections this year say they prefer Congress to be controlled by the Republicans instead of the Democrats , a new poll has found.According to a Wall Street Journal/ NBC News/ Annenberg survey conducted Oct. 10-16 of 1,172 voters , 49 percent of likely voters prefer a Republican-led Congress compared to 44 percent who would like a Democratic-controlled Congress.Republicans also have the advantage among all registered voters . Forty-five percent of those surveyed said they 'd prefer Congress to be led by the GOP , compared to 43 percent who prefer to have the Democrats at the helm . This is the first time in five weeks that the GOP came out ahead , according to The Journal.The findings appear to reinforce polling results from last week that showed that Democrats are less interested in the election than Republicans.The Wall Street Journal/ NBC News/ Annenberg survey also found that among those most interested in the election , 51 percent favored the Republicans compared to 44 percent for Democrats.Lower-interest voters support the Democrats by 52 percent compared to 37 percent . `` [ Today 's ] survey is yet more evidence that Democratic voters are tuning out the midterms . Democrats carried a 10-point lead among low-interest voters , who the party is trying to reach and motivate with vigorous turnout operations across the country . Republicans carried a 10-point lead in the new survey among voters who said they were highly interested in the election , '' The Journal said.The findings come as pundits continue to predict that the Republicans have the best chance of taking control of the Senate.Last week , Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics , projected that the GOP could take up to eight seats . `` Our projection remains a five- to eight-seat Republican gain in the Senate , and with less than three weeks to go , we would much rather be holding the cards Republicans have been dealt versus the ones dealt to the Democrats as both sides play for a Senate majority , '' Sabato said in his `` Crystal Ball '' analysis . The Washington Post also predicted last week that Republicans will take control of the upper chamber , and explained its analysis by looking at the most competitive races.And as of Sunday , The New York Times election model gives Republicans a 69 percent chance of winning the Senate.President Barack Obama 's low approval ratings are believed to be a major factor dragging down the Democrats ' chances . His support among women , in particular , has dropped sharply in battleground states where Democrats are already lagging among male voters .",
