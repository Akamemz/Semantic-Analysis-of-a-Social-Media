    "content": "On a July afternoon in the Capitol Building , in the course of giving his play-by-play of the Senate \u2019 s health care debate , Mark Meadows showed me the call log on his iPhone .\nThe first name was Steve Bannon , followed by Reince Priebus \u2014 both of whom would resign from the White House in the coming weeks but who were , at the time , top aides to President Trump . Then , in all caps , came a code name that was hard to miss : VIP POTUS .\nMeadows tried to play off the names as unusual , a flurry of high-profile calls all flowing from the Senate \u2019 s failed health care push . But in the scheme of Washington today , they were entirely normal . Meadows , a third-term Republican representative from rural North Carolina who doesn \u2019 t hold any top committee positions and is far from House leadership , has become key to congressional business \u2014 a man who , his staff confirms , talks to Trump nearly every day and isn \u2019 t too shy about that .\n\u201c I spoke with the president about three or four days ago , \u201d Meadows said back home in North Carolina during August recess to a group of about 30 constituents , knowing his relationship with Trump would please the crowd . \u201c He says , well , you tell the people of North Carolina that I love them and I appreciate them . \u201d\nSince arriving in Washington in 2013 , Meadows has been central to the biggest stories in Congress . Eight months into his freshman term , he was named an architect of the 2013 government shutdown . Two years later he moved to oust House Speaker John Boehner from his seat , a catalyst to Boehner \u2019 s retirement and House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019 s political ascension .\nOn my first day of covering congressional Republicans \u2014 the day Ryan dropped the House \u2019 s Obamacare repeal bill \u2014 Meadows had already positioned himself as an essential player in negotiations . The chair of the Freedom Caucus , a cohort of roughly 40 men who make up the House \u2019 s most conservative faction , Meadows wields enough votes to stop any Republican-led legislation in its tracks . And he has a direct line to the president if things don \u2019 t go his way \u2014 leverage points he used to make an unpopular health care bill move further to the right in the House .\nNow , as Congress turns its attention to preliminary tax reform talks , he \u2019 s poised to follow the same playbook .\nThe reality of today \u2019 s Congress is that in the House of Representatives , the Freedom Caucus is in control of the Republican agenda \u2014 with Meadows at the helm .

He acts like he \u2019 s saying more than he should . He \u2019 ll tell you about his conversations with Trump and his visits to the White House . He \u2019 ll let you follow him around the Capitol building . When he \u2019 s anxious \u2014 when Trump is calling him angry , when he knows he \u2019 s holding up the Republican agenda \u2014 the rosiness in his face fades , his smile subsides , and his brow furrows .\nOn a rainy Monday morning in a well-lit restaurant in Burnsville , North Carolina , it was the former . Meadows , in his suit and tie , had just come back from Washington . A crowd of elderly supporters , local political figures , and a table of school-age kids , all looked at him in awe . Not only are they fervent Meadows supporters \u2014 they are even more passionate Trump supporters .\n\u201c Do they have any idea how angry and frustrated the people of this country are about how Trump is being treated ? \u201d Dick , an elderly man in a veteran \u2019 s baseball cap , asked Meadows of his Republican colleagues in Congress .\nIf you constructed a Trump district in a laboratory , the result would likely mirror Meadows \u2019 s home in western North Carolina . Tucked between the peaks of the Appalachian Mountains , it \u2019 s rural and overwhelmingly white . There \u2019 s a church at almost every corner \u2014 \u201c God \u2019 s country , \u201d as Meadows calls it .\nHis district is the \u201c Trump country \u201d archetype that was endlessly profiled during the campaign . Abandoned warehouses remain the last vestiges of a manufacturing era unlikely to return ; it \u2019 s why the \u201c again \u201d in \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d resonates so deeply with the most disadvantaged of Meadows \u2019 s constituents .\n\u201c We feel forgotten \u2014 we have a chip on our shoulders in that regard , \u201d North Carolina state Rep. Josh Dobson said of the region .\nAlmost everyone I spoke to in Meadows \u2019 s district talked about those buildings \u2014 about the jobs they used to hold . They were still lamenting industries that left in the 1980s : furniture manufacturing , textiles \u2014 one plant after another shipped overseas , they \u2019 d say .\nBut among the swaths of working-class communities are wealthy pockets of retired Floridians and Georgians who flit between their country club golf courses and places of worship \u2014 where Meadows , until recently , lived . Like the rest of the country , there is a divide between the poor and the wealthy . Meadows now counts himself among the latter .\nMeadows says he arrived in North Carolina from Florida in the 1980s with little to his name . He started a sandwich shop with his wife , Debbie . She was the waitress , and he made the subs .\nMeadows made his riches off a lucrative real estate development business in North Carolina , selling land to wealthy retirees . \u201c He never really got involved in politics per se , \u201d a district staffer said of Meadows \u2019 s political origins . \u201c He was about making money . \u201d\nBefore getting into national politics , Meadows was an active GOP donor and county GOP chair . He says his call to government was a sign from God \u2014 one assisted by a round of Republican redistricting that turned western North Carolina into one of the state \u2019 s most conservative districts . In his early introductory campaign videos , his policy platform was unapologetically pro-life and anti-same-sex marriage . He said he wanted to fend off liberal judges from allowing Sharia law to creep into the United States Constitution and , above all , bring a \u201c sound business approach to Washington , DC. \u201d He stands for \u201c life , liberty , and lower taxes , \u201d he said \u2014 the Tea Party \u2019 s candidate .\nNo one would think of Meadows as a political outsider now . He navigates between rural working-class communities in his district and national Republican Party fundraisers with ease . He fit in with the big donors at the Koch organization \u2019 s semiannual conference this summer in Colorado Springs , Colorado , often pausing on the lakeside path at the luxury Broadmoor resort to chat tax or health care policy with national political reporters .\nIt \u2019 s what makes an otherwise soft-spoken and reverent Meadows a perfect fit for Trump . His schmoozing shucks-and-aw obeisance to the president is only rivaled by his desire to win . In his private life it was to make money , and in his public one to implement the ultra-conservative agenda his constituents voted him , and Trump , to push .\nMeadows likes to say the Freedom Caucus has two rules : Members have to be willing to vote with Republican leadership , and against it . They \u2019 re known for the latter \u2014 \u201c their greatest power is saying no , \u201d said Matt Green , a politics professor with Catholic University of America who studies political leverage in the House .\nIt \u2019 s a power that comes in handy in an era of extreme partisanship , where Republicans and Democrats are unlikely to find bipartisan consensus and Republicans , with a slim majority in both chambers , need overwhelming party consensus to get anything done .\n\u201c Congressional politics is a numbers game , \u201d Green said . \u201c The only number that matters here is 218 \u2014 everything else is BS . \u201d\nMeadows , a self-proclaimed \u201c numbers guy , \u201d knows this math well . On party-line votes , the House can only lose roughly two dozen members \u2014 the Freedom Caucus consists of upward of 40 .\nThe Freedom Caucus was formed in January 2015 as a principled conservative outgrowth of the Republican Study Committee \u2014 a much larger caucus of 172 conservative House members .\nBy June 2015 , the group had staged an act of rebellion against Republican leadership \u2014 34 of them voted against giving then-President Barack Obama more authority to negotiate a Pacific trade deal \u2014 that put Meadows \u2019 s congressional standing on the line . As punishment , Meadows was stripped of his subcommittee chairmanship in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .\n\u201c In 20 years , it was the second-largest of number of us that had ever voted against a rule , \u201d Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) then-chair of the Freedom Caucus , said . \u201c Leadership decided they were going to go after someone , and they picked Mark . \u201d\nMeadows was eventually reinstated , but the move was a clear signal from Republican leadership that the Freedom Caucus was considered an adversarial group . A lot has changed since . Republicans sit in the White House , and Meadows has taken over the Freedom Caucus .\n\u201c Jim \u2019 s a little more combative and Mark is a little more strategic , \u201d Rep. Ken Buck ( R-CO ) said of the difference within the group . It \u2019 s clear the Freedom Caucus \u2014 and Meadows \u2014 considers the Trump presidency a unique opportunity to flex its muscle . Congressional GOP leadership doesn \u2019 t hold all the power anymore . Ryan can \u2019 t punish the Freedom Caucus or run to Democrats on major agenda items like his predecessor John Boehner could .\nMeadows has an opportunity to make his mark on legislation the GOP passes \u2014 if his ideas aren \u2019 t too radical to kill it first .\n\u201c The health care process was an interesting example of the Freedom Caucus not just saying \u2018 no \u2019 ; they are saying \u2018 no and , \u2019 \u201d Green said . It \u2019 s what makes Meadows the natural leader of the Freedom Caucus under the Trump administration .\nJames Wallner , a fellow at the conservative R Street Institute think tank and former executive director of the Senate Steering Committee , explains it as having both the \u201c inside game \u201d and \u201c outside game. \u201d Meadows has allies in conservative advocacy groups , and can rile up his anti-establishment base on the outside as well as work his legislative leverage on the inside .\nBut for a group so adamant on using their leverage to deliver more conservative results , they haven \u2019 t seen much success .\n\u201c You could make the argument that we have had less conservative pieces of legislation because of the Freedom Caucus , \u201d said Brian Walsh , a partner at the public affairs firm Rokk Solutions and former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director .\nMeadows has incentive to back Trump \u2014 not necessarily Republican leadership\nAmong the 750,000 residents he represents , Meadows won by 28 percentage points in 2016 . All 16 counties in the district went for Trump .\nMeadows himself initially backed the other outsider candidate in the race , Ted Cruz , in the 2016 primary . But less than a month before Election Day , Meadows was on Trump \u2019 s private plane , flying to rallies in North Carolina , making the Republican nominee \u2019 s closing argument .\nMeadows and his deputy chief of staff , Wayne King , sat alongside Trump \u2019 s advisers Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller , as well as communications strategists Dan Scavino and Hope Hicks . Trump \u2019 s entourage wasn \u2019 t in the conversation \u2014 it was just Meadows and Trump . In that moment , they understood each other , King said .\nAt his Burnsville event , before the latest White House shake-up , Meadows described what was likely the infamous Bannon whiteboard to a room full of supporters in the district . \u201c It \u2019 s where he made [ the campaign promise ] and when he made it \u2014 he \u2019 s got it all written down , \u201d Meadows said . \u201c Just rows and rows . He \u2019 s going one by one and checking them off . \u201d\nThe room cooed in wonderment . These Americans both cherished stories of their president , Donald Trump , in the hallowed halls of government and reveled in blistering accounts of a broken , out-of-touch Washington .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of dynamic that has allowed Meadows to sit at an extreme of his party : He comes from a safe conservative district , with a fondness for tactics that force Republicans to move to the right .\nThat \u2019 s how he explains his oppositional perspective at the outset of arriving in Congress . \u201c I assumed the conservatives would be a major part of the Republican Party , \u201d he said of when he first got to Washington . \u201c Perhaps it \u2019 s my definition of conservative versus someone else \u2019 s definition . The difference is when we say it , we mean it . \u201d\nAt times , this strategy has put Meadows \u2019 s romance with Trump at risk .\nAt the height of the House \u2019 s health care fight in March , Meadows put The Art of the Deal into action . Trump had forced Meadows into a binary choice : back the House \u2019 s health care bill that Meadows said left too much of Obamacare in place , or shun it and allow the Affordable Care Act to reign \u2014 and Meadows walked away . The moment raised him to 2017 stardom , even making the long list of people Trump has angrily tweeted about .\nBut when conservatives extracted key concessions from Trump to pass the House health bill in May , Meadows was standing beside the president in the Rose Garden , both smiling , again . Already Meadows has outlined another Rube Goldberg-like legislative maneuver \u2014 a blueprint for welfare reform and tax reform that will almost certainly embroil him in a public political battle with Republican leadership over the future of the party \u2019 s agenda .\nMeadows \u2019 s group of House archconservatives \u2014 the Freedom Caucus \u2014 will be blamed for stalling the Republican agenda , and Meadows is known to stand firm until he gets his way .\nThese tactics have earned him a number of enemies in Washington .\nHe refuses to talk about Boehner , with whom he had a well-documented feud . Meadows filed a motion to remove Boehner in 2015 \u2014 a decision that wasn \u2019 t backed by his own Freedom Caucus allies at the time . It \u2019 s all in the past , he says .\n\u201c I have a lot of conservative colleagues that perhaps see our tactics as really too aggressive to when it comes to accomplishing what is important , \u201d Meadows said in an attempt to defend his actions . He works diligently to maintain the persona of a bashful Southerner .\n\u201c I hate for me to be the center of anything , \u201d he tells me . \u201c It \u2019 s against my grain . I \u2019 d love to be a little legislator that \u2019 s behind the scenes doing policy . \u201d\nBut Meadows \u2019 s colleagues in the House openly joke that for a man who insists on being in the background , he is always talking with the press to push his ideas . The day after the Senate \u2019 s health care vote went down in flames , one Republican Congress member walked passed him and audibly muttered , \u201c Phony , \u201d as Meadows talked to the TV cameras .\n\u201c I believe the Freedom Caucus has been Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s greatest asset , \u201d Walsh , the Republican strategist , said . \u201c The ironic thing is , the president is far less conservative [ than the Freedom Caucus ] on fiscal issues . \u201d\nThose close Washington politics know the shtick : Meadows both holds his cards close and plays the same hand each time , forcing his way to the table and walking away when he doesn \u2019 t get what he wants .\nMeadows \u2019 s district is a breeding ground for Trump \u2019 s version of populism\nWhat he wants may not always reflect what many of his constituents say they need . In Meadows \u2019 s district , roughly 98,837 ( 13 percent ) of his constituents were on Medicaid in 2015 \u2014 a program from which Meadows voted to slash more than $ 800 billion in the now-dead American Health Care Act . In 2016 , there were 60,647 people , about 8 percent , on food stamps , roughly one-third of whom ( 19,617 ) would lose assistance under a House budget proposal , which Meadows says does not go far enough on welfare reform .\nDawn Reed , a 49-year-old Mitchell County resident , raised her hand during a constituent meeting with Meadows .\n\u201c Are there any plans for revamping Social Security , SSI , and disability ? There are so many people on these programs , and it doesn \u2019 t cover everyday living expenses , \u201d she said . Reed is on Social Security ; two of her four adult children are also on welfare . She says a lot of people around her are too . Except it \u2019 s getting harder and harder to make ends meet .\n\u201c People think that it \u2019 s so easy to get on these programs and you get this big fat check . No . It doesn \u2019 t work that way , \u201d Reed said , unknowingly unraveling some of the main arguments that conservatives \u2014 and Meadows \u2014 have made against a bloated welfare system for decades .\nMeadows only reiterated the president \u2019 s promise to leave Medicare and Social Security untouched , before launching into a mild tirade about Social Security \u2019 s lack of accountability .\nBut back in Washington , Meadows supports a Freedom Caucus proposal that would make deep cuts to both food stamps and cash assistance \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan \u2019 s bill , which would harshen work requirements on adults without dependents as well as extend work requirements to adults with children \u2014 as a means of finding savings for tax reform and other Republican spending priorities .\nMeadows also voted in favor of Medicaid cuts in the House \u2019 s health bill , claiming they wouldn \u2019 t affect his constituents in North Carolina \u2014 a non-Medicaid expansion state . That \u2019 s not true . The AHCA put per capita caps on Medicaid funding , which would have resulted in cuts across the board .\n\u201c The people who rely on those services , who have become accustomed to those services as part of their lives , of course they don \u2019 t want them to change , \u201d Matthew Wechtel , 47 , the Madison County commissioner , said . \u201c No one is opposed to giving people a hand up ; what people resent it giving people a handout . \u201d\nMeadows \u2019 s constituents believe Trump when he says he represents the \u201c forgotten man and woman. \u201d And many with a hatred for Obamacare trust him when he says he will protect their needs \u2014 regardless of the policy work he \u2019 s actually doing back in Washington . It \u2019 s part of the widely reported tension in the lives of white working-class Trump voters \u2014 Americans who support candidates who work to cut the social welfare programs they depend on .\n\u201c These people don \u2019 t like to work , \u201d said Freddy Penland , 71 , a Yancey County resident and former county commissioner , referring to people benefiting from social safety net programs . \u201c They don \u2019 t work . They get too much assistance . \u201d\nReed , who asked for bolstered Social Security , said she voted for Meadows \u2014 he \u2019 s a \u201c go-getter \u201d she said . You \u2019 d hear it over and over again \u2014 people believe Meadows will do the right thing .\nMeadows says he is \u201c sensitive to the needs that are out there from a safety net perspective. \u201d On protections for people with preexisting conditions , which were weakened in nearly every iteration of the health care bill , he says to trust him .\n\u201c Since I have been a member of Congress , I have lost my sister to cancer , \u201d Meadows told me . \u201c Preexisting condition was a big deal . To suggest that I am willing to look the other way on preexisting conditions defies not only what I have stated [ but ] who I am. \u201d The Congressional Budget Office , the nonpartisan body which evaluates the impact of legislation , warned that the House \u2019 s health care bill would lead to people with preexisting conditions having to pay more for health insurance .\nThe following day , touring a fire station in Granite Falls , North Carolina , talk had just turned to draining the swamp when the room momentarily fell silent . Grace Chapel volunteer firefighter John Taylor , a mustached man in uniform , looked to Meadows matter-of-factly .\n\u201c When you fear us , there \u2019 s liberty , \u201d Taylor said . \u201c When we fear you , it \u2019 s tyranny . \u201d\nHours after the Senate failed to pass its three attempts at Obamacare repeal , I found myself asking Meadows what had just happened .\nHe had been on the phone with senators all day . The senators themselves , asked to comment on GOP leadership \u2019 s final health plan \u2014 a skinny repeal of Obamacare \u2014 would point to a conversation between Meadows and Sen. Lindsey Graham . Ryan \u2019 s comments seemed beside the point .\nIt felt familiar , a recognition of their leverage . But what makes Meadows and the Freedom Caucus powerful is what puts the entirety of the GOP \u2019 s agenda at risk .\nWhen Republicans return from August recess , they will have to tackle the debt ceiling , their budget , tax reform \u2014 and possibly a resurrection of Obamacare repeal efforts . Meadows has staked out his position on all three of those fronts , none of which have enough support from the Republican conference overall .\nMeadows says if Republican leaders do not agree to sweeping changes to welfare programs and a tax plan that slashes corporate tax rates and doubles standard deductions for everyday Americans , the Freedom Caucus will not vote for the budget \u2014 a must-pass vehicle for tax reform . Already , Meadows has declared some minor victories , being in part responsible for killing the border adjustment tax \u2014 one of Republicans \u2019 few ideas to pay for massive tax cuts .\nMeadows may be the perfect vehicle for Trumpism in the House , but he is not , thus far , the master of getting ideas passed into law . Unlike John Boehner , when faced with the Freedom Caucus \u2019 s obstructionism , Paul Ryan does not appear likely to turn to Democrats for compromise . When Meadows says no , the whole train stops moving .\nMeadows could deliver huge conservative wins over the next year , or he could crash what \u2019 s left of the Trump agenda . That \u2019 s how this works .\nWhen Ryan says a vote is all or nothing \u2014 that you can either vote for the proposed plan to replace Obamacare or don \u2019 t , making Obamacare the \u201c law of the land \u201d \u2014 Meadows \u2019 s response is that there \u2019 s no such thing as a \u201c binary choice . \u201d\nAny time you don \u2019 t have the votes , \u201c negotiations aren \u2019 t totally over , \u201d he says . Not , at least , until Meadows says they are .",

He said he wanted to fend off liberal judges from allowing Sharia law to creep into the United States Constitution and, above all, bring a \u201csound business approach to Washington, DC.\u201d He stands for \u201clife, liberty, and lower taxes,\u201d he said \u2014 the Tea Party\u2019s candidate.\n\nNo one would think of Meadows as a political outsider now. He navigates between rural working-class communities in his district and national Republican Party fundraisers with ease. He fit in with the big donors at the Koch organization\u2019s semiannual conference this summer in Colorado Springs, Colorado, often pausing on the lakeside path at the luxury Broadmoor resort to chat tax or health care policy with national political reporters.\n\nIt\u2019s what makes an otherwise soft-spoken and reverent Meadows a perfect fit for Trump. His schmoozing shucks-and-aw obeisance to the president is only rivaled by his desire to win. In his private life it was to make money, and in his public one to implement the ultra-conservative agenda his constituents voted him, and Trump, to push.\n\nTo the Freedom Caucus, \u201cno\u201d goes a long way\n\nMeadows likes to say the Freedom Caucus has two rules: Members have to be willing to vote with Republican leadership, and against it. They\u2019re known for the latter \u2014 \u201ctheir greatest power is saying no,\u201d said Matt Green, a politics professor with Catholic University of America who studies political leverage in the House.\n\nIt\u2019s a power that comes in handy in an era of extreme partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are unlikely to find bipartisan consensus and Republicans, with a slim majority in both chambers, need overwhelming party consensus to get anything done.\n\n\u201cCongressional politics is a numbers game,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe only number that matters here is 218 \u2014 everything else is BS. \u201d\n\nMeadows, a self-proclaimed \u201cnumbers guy,\u201d knows this math well. On party-line votes, the House can only lose roughly two dozen members \u2014 the Freedom Caucus consists of upward of 40.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus was formed in January 2015 as a principled conservative outgrowth of the Republican Study Committee \u2014 a much larger caucus of 172 conservative House members.\n\nBy June 2015, the group had staged an act of rebellion against Republican leadership \u2014 34 of them voted against giving then-President Barack Obama more authority to negotiate a Pacific trade deal \u2014 that put Meadows\u2019s congressional standing on the line. As punishment, Meadows was stripped of his subcommittee chairmanship in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\n\u201cIn 20 years, it was the second-largest of number of us that had ever voted against a rule,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) then-chair of the Freedom Caucus, said. \u201cLeadership decided they were going to go after someone, and they picked Mark.\u201d\n\nMeadows was eventually reinstated, but the move was a clear signal from Republican leadership that the Freedom Caucus was considered an adversarial group. A lot has changed since. Republicans sit in the White House, and Meadows has taken over the Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cJim\u2019s a little more combative and Mark is a little more strategic,\u201d Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) said of the difference within the group. It\u2019s clear the Freedom Caucus \u2014 and Meadows \u2014 considers the Trump presidency a unique opportunity to flex its muscle. Congressional GOP leadership doesn\u2019t hold all the power anymore. Ryan can\u2019t punish the Freedom Caucus or run to Democrats on major agenda items like his predecessor John Boehner could.\n\nMeadows has an opportunity to make his mark on legislation the GOP passes \u2014 if his ideas aren\u2019t too radical to kill it first.\n\n\u201cThe health care process was an interesting example of the Freedom Caucus not just saying \u2018no\u2019; they are saying \u2018no and,\u2019\u201d Green said. It\u2019s what makes Meadows the natural leader of the Freedom Caucus under the Trump administration.\n\nJames Wallner, a fellow at the conservative R Street Institute think tank and former executive director of the Senate Steering Committee, explains it as having both the \u201cinside game\u201d and \u201coutside game.\u201d Meadows has allies in conservative advocacy groups, and can rile up his anti-establishment base on the outside as well as work his legislative leverage on the inside.\n\nBut for a group so adamant on using their leverage to deliver more conservative results, they haven\u2019t seen much success.\n\n\u201cYou could make the argument that we have had less conservative pieces of legislation because of the Freedom Caucus,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a partner at the public affairs firm Rokk Solutions and former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director.\n\nMeadows has incentive to back Trump \u2014 not necessarily Republican leadership\n\nAmong the 750,000 residents he represents, Meadows won by 28 percentage points in 2016. All 16 counties in the district went for Trump.\n\nMeadows himself initially backed the other outsider candidate in the race, Ted Cruz, in the 2016 primary. But less than a month before Election Day, Meadows was on Trump\u2019s private plane, flying to rallies in North Carolina, making the Republican nominee\u2019s closing argument.\n\nMeadows and his deputy chief of staff, Wayne King, sat alongside Trump\u2019s advisers Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, as well as communications strategists Dan Scavino and Hope Hicks. Trump\u2019s entourage wasn\u2019t in the conversation \u2014 it was just Meadows and Trump. In that moment, they understood each other, King said.\n\nAt his Burnsville event, before the latest White House shake-up, Meadows described what was likely the infamous Bannon whiteboard to a room full of supporters in the district. \u201cIt\u2019s where he made [the campaign promise] and when he made it \u2014 he\u2019s got it all written down,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cJust rows and rows. He\u2019s going one by one and checking them off.\u201d\n\nThe room cooed in wonderment. These Americans both cherished stories of their president, Donald Trump, in the hallowed halls of government and reveled in blistering accounts of a broken, out-of-touch Washington.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of dynamic that has allowed Meadows to sit at an extreme of his party: He comes from a safe conservative district, with a fondness for tactics that force Republicans to move to the right.\n\nThat\u2019s how he explains his oppositional perspective at the outset of arriving in Congress. \u201cI assumed the conservatives would be a major part of the Republican Party,\u201d he said of when he first got to Washington. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s my definition of conservative versus someone else\u2019s definition. The difference is when we say it, we mean it.\u201d\n\nAt times, this strategy has put Meadows\u2019s romance with Trump at risk.\n\nAt the height of the House\u2019s health care fight in March, Meadows put The Art of the Deal into action. Trump had forced Meadows into a binary choice: back the House\u2019s health care bill that Meadows said left too much of Obamacare in place, or shun it and allow the Affordable Care Act to reign \u2014 and Meadows walked away. The moment raised him to 2017 stardom, even making the long list of people Trump has angrily tweeted about.\n\nBut when conservatives extracted key concessions from Trump to pass the House health bill in May, Meadows was standing beside the president in the Rose Garden, both smiling, again. Already Meadows has outlined another Rube Goldberg-like legislative maneuver \u2014 a blueprint for welfare reform and tax reform that will almost certainly embroil him in a public political battle with Republican leadership over the future of the party\u2019s agenda.\n\nMeadows\u2019s group of House archconservatives \u2014 the Freedom Caucus \u2014 will be blamed for stalling the Republican agenda, and Meadows is known to stand firm until he gets his way.\n\nThese tactics have earned him a number of enemies in Washington.\n\nHe refuses to talk about Boehner, with whom he had a well-documented feud. Meadows filed a motion to remove Boehner in 2015 \u2014 a decision that wasn\u2019t backed by his own Freedom Caucus allies at the time. It\u2019s all in the past, he says.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of conservative colleagues that perhaps see our tactics as really too aggressive to when it comes to accomplishing what is important,\u201d Meadows said in an attempt to defend his actions. He works diligently to maintain the persona of a bashful Southerner.\n\n\u201cI hate for me to be the center of anything,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s against my grain. I\u2019d love to be a little legislator that\u2019s behind the scenes doing policy.\u201d\n\nBut Meadows\u2019s colleagues in the House openly joke that for a man who insists on being in the background, he is always talking with the press to push his ideas. The day after the Senate\u2019s health care vote went down in flames, one Republican Congress member walked passed him and audibly muttered, \u201cPhony,\u201d as Meadows talked to the TV cameras.\n\n\u201cI believe the Freedom Caucus has been Nancy Pelosi\u2019s greatest asset,\u201d Walsh, the Republican strategist, said. \u201cThe ironic thing is, the president is far less conservative [than the Freedom Caucus] on fiscal issues.\u201d\n\nThose close Washington politics know the shtick: Meadows both holds his cards close and plays the same hand each time, forcing his way to the table and walking away when he doesn\u2019t get what he wants.\n\nMeadows\u2019s district is a breeding ground for Trump\u2019s version of populism\n\nWhat he wants may not always reflect what many of his constituents say they need. In Meadows\u2019s district, roughly 98,837 (13 percent) of his constituents were on Medicaid in 2015 \u2014 a program from which Meadows voted to slash more than $800 billion in the now-dead American Health Care Act. In 2016, there were 60,647 people, about 8 percent, on food stamps, roughly one-third of whom (19,617) would lose assistance under a House budget proposal, which Meadows says does not go far enough on welfare reform.\n\nDawn Reed, a 49-year-old Mitchell County resident, raised her hand during a constituent meeting with Meadows.\n\n\u201cAre there any plans for revamping Social Security, SSI, and disability? There are so many people on these programs, and it doesn\u2019t cover everyday living expenses,\u201d she said. Reed is on Social Security; two of her four adult children are also on welfare. She says a lot of people around her are too. Except it\u2019s getting harder and harder to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cPeople think that it\u2019s so easy to get on these programs and you get this big fat check. No. It doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d Reed said, unknowingly unraveling some of the main arguments that conservatives \u2014 and Meadows \u2014 have made against a bloated welfare system for decades.\n\nMeadows only reiterated the president\u2019s promise to leave Medicare and Social Security untouched, before launching into a mild tirade about Social Security\u2019s lack of accountability.\n\nBut back in Washington, Meadows supports a Freedom Caucus proposal that would make deep cuts to both food stamps and cash assistance \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan\u2019s bill, which would harshen work requirements on adults without dependents as well as extend work requirements to adults with children \u2014 as a means of finding savings for tax reform and other Republican spending priorities.\n\nMeadows also voted in favor of Medicaid cuts in the House\u2019s health bill, claiming they wouldn\u2019t affect his constituents in North Carolina \u2014 a non-Medicaid expansion state. That\u2019s not true. The AHCA put per capita caps on Medicaid funding, which would have resulted in cuts across the board.\n\n\u201cThe people who rely on those services, who have become accustomed to those services as part of their lives, of course they don\u2019t want them to change,\u201d Matthew Wechtel, 47, the Madison County commissioner, said. \u201cNo one is opposed to giving people a hand up; what people resent it giving people a handout.\u201d\n\nMeadows\u2019s constituents believe Trump when he says he represents the \u201cforgotten man and woman.\u201d And many with a hatred for Obamacare trust him when he says he will protect their needs \u2014 regardless of the policy work he\u2019s actually doing back in Washington. It\u2019s part of the widely reported tension in the lives of white working-class Trump voters \u2014 Americans who support candidates who work to cut the social welfare programs they depend on.\n\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t like to work,\u201d said Freddy Penland, 71, a Yancey County resident and former county commissioner, referring to people benefiting from social safety net programs. \u201cThey don\u2019t work. They get too much assistance.\u201d\n\nReed, who asked for bolstered Social Security, said she voted for Meadows \u2014 he\u2019s a \u201cgo-getter\u201d she said. You\u2019d hear it over and over again \u2014 people believe Meadows will do the right thing.\n\nMeadows says he is \u201csensitive to the needs that are out there from a safety net perspective.\u201d On protections for people with preexisting conditions, which were weakened in nearly every iteration of the health care bill, he says to trust him.\n\n\u201cSince I have been a member of Congress, I have lost my sister to cancer,\u201d Meadows told me. \u201cPreexisting condition was a big deal. To suggest that I am willing to look the other way on preexisting conditions defies not only what I have stated [but] who I am.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan body which evaluates the impact of legislation, warned that the House\u2019s health care bill would lead to people with preexisting conditions having to pay more for health insurance.\n\nThe following day, touring a fire station in Granite Falls, North Carolina, talk had just turned to draining the swamp when the room momentarily fell silent. Grace Chapel volunteer firefighter John Taylor, a mustached man in uniform, looked to Meadows matter-of-factly.\n\n\u201cWhen you fear us, there\u2019s liberty,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen we fear you, it\u2019s tyranny.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna quote you,\u201d Meadows replied with a smile.\n\nCan the Freedom Caucus govern?\n\nHours after the Senate failed to pass its three attempts at Obamacare repeal, I found myself asking Meadows what had just happened.\n\nHe had been on the phone with senators all day. The senators themselves, asked to comment on GOP leadership\u2019s final health plan \u2014 a skinny repeal of Obamacare \u2014 would point to a conversation between Meadows and Sen. Lindsey Graham. Ryan\u2019s comments seemed beside the point.\n\nIt felt familiar, a recognition of their leverage. But what makes Meadows and the Freedom Caucus powerful is what puts the entirety of the GOP\u2019s agenda at risk.\n\nWhen Republicans return from August recess, they will have to tackle the debt ceiling, their budget, tax reform \u2014 and possibly a resurrection of Obamacare repeal efforts. Meadows has staked out his position on all three of those fronts, none of which have enough support from the Republican conference overall.\n\nMeadows says if Republican leaders do not agree to sweeping changes to welfare programs and a tax plan that slashes corporate tax rates and doubles standard deductions for everyday Americans, the Freedom Caucus will not vote for the budget \u2014 a must-pass vehicle for tax reform. Already, Meadows has declared some minor victories, being in part responsible for killing the border adjustment tax \u2014 one of Republicans\u2019 few ideas to pay for massive tax cuts.\n\nMeadows may be the perfect vehicle for Trumpism in the House, but he is not, thus far, the master of getting ideas passed into law. Unlike John Boehner, when faced with the Freedom Caucus\u2019s obstructionism, Paul Ryan does not appear likely to turn to Democrats for compromise. When Meadows says no, the whole train stops moving.\n\nMeadows could deliver huge conservative wins over the next year, or he could crash what\u2019s left of the Trump agenda. That\u2019s how this works.\n\nWhen Ryan says a vote is all or nothing \u2014 that you can either vote for the proposed plan to replace Obamacare or don\u2019t, making Obamacare the \u201claw of the land\u201d \u2014 Meadows\u2019s response is that there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cbinary choice.\u201d\n\nAny time you don\u2019t have the votes, \u201cnegotiations aren\u2019t totally over,\u201d he says. Not, at least, until Meadows says they are.",
