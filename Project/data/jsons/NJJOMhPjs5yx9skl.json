Raul Grijalva of Arizona , the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee , told National Journal this week that he may have been guilty of overreach even as he defended his probe into the funding sources of seven professors , now known as the \u201c Grijalva Seven . \u201d\n\u201c I think that us asking for empirical , fact-based science is not trying to stop research , \u201d Mr. Grijalva told MSNBC \u2019 s Ed Schultz on Monday night . \u201c Research can be done . If the Koch brothers or Exxon want to fund their research , fine . Just disclose that that \u2019 s who \u2019 s funding it so the American people can make their own decisions . \u201d\nThree Senate Democrats \u2014 Barbara Boxer of California , Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2014 are conducting their own probe of 100 fossil fuel companies and trade associations funding climate research .\nTheir objective ? To find out whether the organizations \u201c are funding scientific studies designed to confuse the public and avoid taking action to cut carbon pollution , and whether the funded scientists fail to disclose the sources of their funding in scientific publications or in testimony to legislators . \u201d\nThe result is that Democrats are facing the kind of criticism usually reserved for Republicans in academic circles , even at left-leaning institutions . Among those under investigation is Roger Pielke Jr. , an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder .\n\u201c We stand behind him , \u201d a university official said last week .\nThe Denver Post declared in a Tuesday editorial , \u201c CU rightly defends Roger Pielke Jr. against political bully . \u201d\n\u201c I think the Democrats , anytime you \u2019 re trying to enforce group-think or punish a professor for their scientific and legitimate views \u2014 and if you listen to this professor \u2019 s [ views ] , they sound fairly reasonable , frankly \u2014 I think the Democrats look very bad on this , \u201d Denver political analyst Floyd Ciruli said Sunday on KUSA-TV \u2019 s \u201c Between the Lines \u201d with Brandon Rittiman .\nMr. Grijalva said in letters to universities that he wants to ascertain whether the professors have financial conflicts of interest , but his probe has outraged lawmakers , academics and scientists concerned about a potential \u201c chilling effect \u201d on research .\nThe professors have challenged the theory that climate change is driving extreme weather events such as hurricanes and blizzards .\n\u201c Publicly singling out specific researchers based on perspectives they have expressed and implying a failure to appropriately disclose funding sources \u2014 and thereby questioning their scientific integrity \u2014 sends a chilling message to all academic researchers , \u201d Keith L. Seitter , executive director of the American Meteorological Society , said in a letter last week to Mr. Grijalva .\nMr. Grijalva argues that the inquiry is necessary to ensure the impartiality of the professors \u2019 past congressional testimony . The dual investigations were launched days after Greenpeace released documents that showed Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics aerospace engineer Wei-Hock \u201c Willie \u201d Soon had received $ 1.2 million in research funding since 2008 from fossil fuel interests , including Exxon Mobil Corp. and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation .\nMr . Soon , who has challenged computer models that predict increases in global temperatures , did not disclose his funding source in at least 11 papers since 2008 , according to The New York Times .\nMr . Soon has acknowledged as recently as 2013 that he receives funding from fossil fuel companies and insists that he is not motivated by money .\n\u201c Climate Change on Campus : Research for Hire ? \u201d says an ominous-looking post on the House Natural Resources Committee minority website overlaying a photo of factory smokestacks .\nMr. Seitter countered that \u201c peer-review is the appropriate mechanism to assess the validity and quality of scientific research , regardless of the funding sources supporting that research as long as those funding sources and any potential conflicts of interest are fully disclosed . \u201d\nThe White House is pushing for tougher emissions standards in the name of combating climate change even as some scientists , dubbed by critics as \u201c deniers , \u201d question how much impact increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has on specific weather events .\nMr. Pielke and others have described the House investigation as an attempt to discredit those who challenge the climate change movement \u2019 s contention that rising levels of carbon dioxide are driving natural disasters such as hurricanes and blizzards .\n\u201c Before continuing , let me make one point abundantly clear : I have no funding , declared or undeclared , with any fossil fuel company or interest . I never have , \u201d Mr. Pielke said in a Feb. 25 post on his website The Climate Fix that appeared under a photo of former Sen. Joseph McCarthy .\n\u201c Representative Grijalva knows this too , because when I have testified before the U.S. Congress , I have disclosed my funding and possible conflicts of interest , \u201d he said . \u201c So I know with complete certainty that this investigation is a politically-motivated \u2018 witch hunt \u2019 designed to intimidate me ( and others ) and to smear my name . \u201d\nA spokesman for Rep . Rob Bishop , the Utah Republican who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee , said Feb. 27 that Mr. Bishop is focused on reducing carbon emissions through efforts such as forest management reforms and reductions in gas flaring on federal lands .\n\u201c This type of political theater is nothing more than a distraction , \u201d spokesman Parish Braden said in an email .\nSen.
