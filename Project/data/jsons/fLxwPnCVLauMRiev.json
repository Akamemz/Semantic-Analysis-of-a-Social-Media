John McCain told CNN Wednesday .\nMcCain is not alone in raising alarm bells about how the White House 's scattershot focus could eventually make Americans less safe .\nIn stunning comments for a sitting member of the top military brass , Army Gen. Raymond `` Tony '' Thomas warned at a symposium in Maryland Tuesday that `` our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil . I hope they sort it out soon because we 're a nation at war . ''\nThe warnings come as the West Wing becomes inexorably more entwined in political dramas and internal staff intrigues that threaten to detract from Trump 's crucial first 100 days .\nMushrooming drama over the Trump campaign 's alleged connections to Russia , which claimed the scalp of his national security adviser Michael Flynn , is working its way relentlessly closer to the President himself .\nTrump is refusing to answer questions about a CNN report that some of his advisers were in constant communication with Russian operatives at a time when Moscow was trying to tip the US election his way . But his silence means the furor grows by the day , and he ca n't put the distracting saga to rest .\n`` This is a major distraction , even if you are not the President or the vice president -- it affects the entire building . It affects the entire national security apparatus , '' said Mark Lowenthal , a former CIA assistant director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production .\n`` It is very hard to focus on your work , to focus on the things you should be working on when you have all of this swirl going on around you , '' Lowenthal told CNN International .\nJUST WATCHED Trump : I can live with 2 or 1-state solution Replay More Videos ...
