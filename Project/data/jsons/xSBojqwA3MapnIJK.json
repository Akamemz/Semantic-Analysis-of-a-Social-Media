''\nAnd on guns , Obama framed the issue , one the president made a priority after 20 students and six adults were killed at a school shooting in Newtown , Connecticut , as something that would save both American and Mexican lives .\n`` We also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in Mexico come from the United States , '' the president said . `` I will continue to do everything in my power to pass common sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people , that can save lives here in Mexico and back home in the United States . ''\nIn interviews before the speech , however , most students in the crowd did not mention guns or immigration as issues they hoped the president would discuss .

''\nThe president also announced plans to encourage 100,000 students from the United States to study in Latin America , including Mexico , each year , and for the same number of Latin American students to come to the United States .\nAlthough many of the students live in Mexico City , an area that has witnessed far fewer incidents of drug-related violence than the north , the war on drugs was not far from most students ' minds .\n`` The biggest thing I want to see is how the U.S. and Mexico are willing to tackle the war on drugs , '' said Julio Meyer , another 18-year-old senior . `` In my point of view , it has not been successful . ''\nOn Thursday , at a news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Obama stressed the focus of his trip is the economy , not security and immigration , two issues Obama said often get too much attention when it comes to talking about the U.S.-Mexico relationship .\n`` We do n't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue , '' Obama said . `` We want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between Mexico and the United States . ''\nBut even as Obama and Pena Nieto pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics , security issues loomed large over Thursday 's meeting\nPena Nieto said Thursday that his government remains committed to fighting organized crime , but the United States and Mexico must `` cooperate on the basis of mutual respect , to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in Mexico . ''\nObama stressed that the countries will continue to cooperate closely on security , but he did n't specify how .\n`` I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security , even as that nature of that close cooperation will evolve , '' he said .\nIt 's up to the Mexican people , Obama said , `` to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations , including the United States . ''\nBefore Obama 's arrival , a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how Mexico cooperates with the United States .\nUnder the new rules , all U.S. requests for collaboration with Mexican agencies will flow through a single office , Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told Mexico 's state-run Notimex news agency .\nIt is a drastic change from recent years , when U.S. agents enjoyed widespread access to their Mexican counterparts .\nCritics have expressed concerns that Pena Nieto 's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year . On Tuesday -- two days before Obama 's arrival -- his government arrested the father-in-law of Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman , head of Mexico 's Sinaloa cartel and one of the country 's most-wanted drug lords .\nBut with the focus on the economy , Pena Nieto said the presidents agreed to create a new high-level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations . The group , which will include Cabinet ministers from both countries and Vice President Joe Biden , will have its first meeting this fall , the Mexican president said .\nImports and exports between the United States and Mexico totaled nearly $ 500 billion last year , and before Obama 's arrival officials on both sides of the border said economic relations would be a focal point during the U.S. president 's visit .\nLater , he traveled to Costa Rica , where he met with President Laura Chinchilla and other regional leaders .\nObama pledged continued U.S. support to the Central American Regional Security Initiative , saying `` with the absence of security , '' it is very hard to develop economically .\n`` Problems like narco-trafficking arise when a country is vulnerable because of poverty and institutions not working for people , '' he said .\n`` The stronger the economy and institutions for individuals seeking legitimate careers , the less powerful these narco-trafficking operations are going to be .
