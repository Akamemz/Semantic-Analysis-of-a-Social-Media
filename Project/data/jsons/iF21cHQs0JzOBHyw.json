    "content": "Partisan conflict is not new , nor is GOP internal dissent . What \u2019 s new is in-fighting among the elites .\nAbout a third of the Democratic party ( 15\u201320 percent perhaps of the electorate ? ) loathes Trump , from reasons of the trivial to the fundamental .\nThe hard-leftist hatred is visceral ; it is multidimensional ; and it is unalterable .\nTrump is rich , crass , showy , a white male , and 70 . As the anti-Obama , he punches every progressive button in existence . A candidate like Trump was not supposed to exist any longer in the 21st-Century Age of Obama , much less should he have ruined the anticipated progressive Obama-Clinton 16-year regnum . Trump \u2019 s accent is outer-borough and seems to exemplify for Trump haters the gaucheness of the golden trump name stamped all over New York . The Europeans have utter contempt for Trump , and that embarrasses leftists especially .\nUnlike some Republican politicians who wished to be admired by cultural progressives , Trump prefers baiting the Left and its media appendages , as if to remind them that he prefers to overturn the entire progressive project of the last eight years \u2014 if not on ideological grounds ( Trump not so long ago voiced a number of centrist and liberal views ) , at least out of tit-for-tat animosity . Unlike a restrained presidential Bush or a sober Romney , the president answers in kind \u2014 and trumps \u2014 the boilerplate leftist charge of \u201c fascist ! \u201d and \u201c Nazi ! \u201d leveled against him .\nThe Trump haters dominate our media and the universities , the entertainment industries , Silicon Valley , the billionaire green classes , the foundations and the brigades of professional foot-soldier activists , identity-politics operatives , and the Bernie Sanders shock troops . They are frenzied because they think their 1,000 cuts have finally hit arteries \u2014 only to see Trump revive in Nietzschean fashion , emerging stronger for the wounds . To come so close to ending this nightmare only to realize they are at the alpha and not the omega of their efforts intensifies their hatred .\nRitually cutting off Trump \u2019 s head , blowing him up , stabbing him to death , hanging him , beating him to a pulp \u2014 these all are the rhetorical bookends of the Left \u2019 s efforts to subvert the Electoral College , the Russian-collusion mythologies , the impeachment and 25th Amendments psychodramas , and Trump \u2019 s hoped-for physical collapse under the stress of pure hatred . The calls for Trump \u2019 s assassination or maiming , if , mutatis mutandis , aimed at Obama would have earned long jail time for dozens ; now assassination porn becomes an object of emulation .\nYet Trump hatred only solidifies the Trump base . It also reminds independents and wavering centrist Republicans that in a Manichean fight ( and the Trump haters seem to envision the current landscape as just that ) , one inevitably chooses sides . If the choice is reduced to a crude rant at a public Trump rally or the rioters at Claremont , Berkeley , and Middlebury , a screaming Madonna , the \u201c pigs in blanket \u201d chanters of Black Lives Matter , and the masked marauders of Antifa , the Trump haters probably lose .\nMainstream Democrats in politics are bewildered as much as repelled by Trump . They find him scary because their party that professes contempt for wacky Trump supporters somehow finds conservatives in control of all the traditional levers of political power , from the local to the state to the national level . There is no more Blue Wall , and Democrats know why .\nTrumpism is insidiously predatory and picks off Democratic working constituencies like wolves do wandering sheep from the herd \u2014 with nocturnal howls to fair trade , reenergized industrialization , energy production , immigration enforcement , realism aboard , and infrastructure investment .\nLikewise , savvy Democrats fear Trump because they had long preached that \u201c demography is destiny \u201d only to learn that lots of minority bloc voting in solidly red or blue states was not as electorally potent as a riled working white class in key swing states . The knowledge that the outsider and supposed fool Trump grasped that truth while both his Republican primary rivals and Hillary Clinton did not proves especially irritating . Hillary is now reduced to daydreaming about what a tougher Hillary might have said to Trump during the debate , incoherently bragging she was not intimidated as she proves that in fact she was .\nWhat also scares mainstream Democrats is that Trumpism may have exposed an existential vulnerability of the contemporary Democratic party , heretofore known but rarely voiced : It is now a rich man \u2019 s , bifurcated party of the two coasts . It hates the culture of the middle classes ( who lack both the romance of the poor and the refinement of the rich ) and cynically relies on promises of never-ending entitlements for the underclass . It offers boutique issues for the affluent who , with winks and nods , are assured that they will have the clout and money to navigate around the messy ramifications of their own policy positions . In other words , it is tailor-made to empower a figure like Trump .\nDemocratic establishmentarians fear that their own identity politics are feeding Trump \u2019 s rise . But they \u2019 d rather lose elections than forfeit a decade \u2019 s worth of race and gender investments .\nProgressives do not mind being called starry-eyed , utopian , impractical , or even socialist ; they do fear being tagged as elitists by populists and economic nationalists , especially by a Manhattan billionaire . Trump has leveled that charge as no other Republican has since Ronald Reagan in 1984 . Like addicts who know that their fix is both killing them and yet can not be kicked , so too Democratic establishmentarians fear that their own identity politics are feeding Trump \u2019 s rise . Nevertheless , they would rather lose elections than forfeit a decade \u2019 s worth of race and gender investments . For now , they fool themselves into thinking that the latest Trump outrage is the longed-for final straw that crushes the presidential back .\nTen to 15 percent of the electorate are pure pragmatists . In general , they like neither politics nor controversies . They have enough moral figures in their lives without requiring their president to be an ethical icon . Their idea of a good president is one rarely seen or heard , but evident on autopilot when we have a robust economy , quietude overseas , and unity at home . Independents liked Obama \u2019 s last year when he vanished from view and let candidates duke it out \u2014 as the abstract idea of Obama was always preferable to the reality .\nYet independents also notice that an incompetent and haughty Obama left havoc in his wake , though they nod that at least he was \u201c presidential , \u201d which means presentable to elites abroad . If American under Trump hits a 3 percent rate of GDP annual growth , unemployment dips below 4 percent , a soaring stock market does not crash , and the administration makes some progress on lowering the deficit , carefully raising interest rates , and reducing taxes , the fence-sitters become Trumpers . If not , they are loud anti-Trumpers repulsed by his tweets and Make American Great Again rallies . Right now , they sense \u2014 but are not quite convinced \u2014 that it is more likely for a while that Trump \u2019 s negatives will be overshadowed by good economic and foreign-policy news .\nAbout 10 percent of Republicans \u2014 overrepresented among the coastal intellectual , political , and affluent strata \u2014 despise Trump every bit as much as do their hard-core progressive counterparts .\nFor some , to be fair , the loathing is entirely principled : After damning progressives for being uncouth , reckless in their personal lives , loose in speech and behavior , how can they now excuse Trump , the messenger , just because his message is often convenient ?\nThis species of Never Trumpers sees support for Trump as abject ethical treason . They would even rather live with a Clinton Supreme Court for 30 years than be stained by Trumpian enablement and hypocrisy ( \u201c wrong with Hillary is preferable to right with Trump \u201d ) . They prefer catharsis to governance with Trump and dream that they will be ready to rebuild the party of George H. W. Bush and Paul Ryan after the fires of such ritual cleansing have incinerated the Trump yahoos .\nOther sorts of Never Trumpers are schizophrenic and even somewhat remorseful . After a bad Trump week , they exuberantly brag to friends or write \u201c I told you so \u201d columns . When good Trump news lingers for a few days or so , they grow sullen in fear not merely that others are fooled by Trump and amoral in their utilitarianism , but that they might be fooled as well : They hate Trump the man , in the abstract , while they \u2019 re relieved that Trump the message , alongside his concrete actions , is almost what they wanted .\nA final Never Trump cadre is neither ideological nor political , but more careerist . They had bet that the outrageous Trump candidacy was a joke that had no chance of winning , and so they made the necessary careerist adjustments . They wrote him off and bet their reputations for wisdom on their opposition to Trump , and in some cases they even ventured to support the sure-thing Clinton administration . After November , they became orphaned for their wrong-headed wagers , without a constituency among their own , and increasingly deemed less useful by the Left , MSNBC , or NPR . When Trump won , they doubled down and swore that he would implode from sheer incompetence or crudity , or would finally reveal his Manhattan liberalism , in league with Senate Democrats .\nWhen that prognosis proved flawed , they overworked their thesauruses , and rewrote or rephrased the same \u201c I despise Trump \u201d mantra for the thousandth time . They are invested career-wise in Trump \u2019 s failure , and at this juncture , apparently nothing short of it will redeem them ( at least in their own eyes ) and restore them to the grandees who not long ago sought out their guidance and advice . They are wandering Odysseuses , but without either a ten-year limit to their meanderings or a home to return to .\nFor this small subset of Never Trumpers , Hell is not eight 16 years of Obama-Clinton , but rather being ignored by television , shut out of White House councils , and relegated to D-list dinners . The more admirable of this subset of Never Trumpers ask no quarter and voice no regrets as they flit in the shadows . In contrast , the more opportunistic can not hide their own motivations , glimpsed in inadvertent written and verbal tics about lost speaking engagements and White House snubs .\nRepublican establishmentarians logically might thank Trump \u2019 s movement , given that they now control the majorities of the state legislatures , governorships , and all the branches of the federal government . Yet they still feel that saying \u201c I voted for and support Donald J. Trump \u201d is almost not worth the political price . They believe that Trump is unsteady and dangerous ( and they may be right ) , but they concede that 90 percent of Republicans ( no less than in 2008 and 2016 ) voted for the Republican nominee .\nFor all their skepticism of Trump , they are quietly relieved by the excellence of his appointments , the boldness of his proposals , and ( so far ) the obvious conservativism of most of his agenda items . They wish only that he would cease tweeting , stop attacking Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell , cancel campaign rallies , and end the impromptu news conferences .\nAnd yet they are not quite sure that Trump \u2019 s in-your-face aggression is not the source of his support , and so they worry that if he were more like they are , he might lose his ability to empower them . They are more plentiful than , but not unlike , the few old congressional Democratic blue dogs who were not so silly as to deny that Obama \u2019 s obnoxious but winning radicalism was to their own political benefit .\nAbout 20\u201325 percent of voters will not abandon Trump for two reasons \u2014 but they would for one .\nFirst , his conservatism is populist and aimed at the working rather than managerial , professional , and intellectual classes .\nFor his base , Trump \u2019 s rants and impromptu attacks are not proof that he is unhinged but reassurance that he would eye-gouge and bite off the ear of the Left to the bitter end \u2014 and do it authentically and passionately .\nTwo , to paraphrase Lincoln \u2019 s assessment of the rumored drinking of Grant ( akin to Trump \u2019 s tweeting ) during the Shiloh ordeal : \u201c He fights. \u201d For his base , Trump \u2019 s rants and impromptu attacks are not proof that he is unhinged but reassurance that he would eye-gouge and bite off the ear of the Left to the bitter end \u2014 and do it authentically and passionately , the same way that they do too in their own workplace or at the bowling alley .
