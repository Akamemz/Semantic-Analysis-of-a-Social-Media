Not everyone agrees with the new guidance : some argue more HPV testing will lead to an over-diagnosis and treatment of infections that may resolve on their own .\nNew interim guidelines suggest a new strategy for cervical-cancer screening\nIn new `` interim guidance '' \u2014 published today in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology \u2014 experts from influential medical groups such as the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology argue that doctors should consider replacing the Pap smear with the HPV ( human papillomavirus ) test in women ages 25 to 65 .\nThe Pap smear would still be the primary screening method in women under 25 , and would be used to look for irregular cells in some older women who get a positive result from the HPV test .\nThis is a change from the current guidelines , which recommend Pap smears alone at three year intervals for women under 30 , or the additional option of `` co-testing '' with both the Pap and HPV test at five year intervals for women ages 30 to 65 .\nThe rationale is that we now know most all cervical cancers ( between 90 and 99 percent ) are caused by HPV .
