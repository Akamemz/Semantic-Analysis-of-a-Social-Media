    "content": "New England talk radio host Howie Carr told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that not a single listener called in to his Friday radio program to express support for Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House .\n\u201c We asked for everyone listening who supports Paul Ryan for Speaker to call us and explain why . When the phone didn \u2019 t ring , we knew it was them , \u201d Carr told \u2588\u2588\u2588 exclusively .\nSince Kevin McCarthy announced he would not seek the Speakership , the Washington media and the Republican donor-class have aggressively sought to push Paul Ryan into the Speaker \u2019 s role .\nPaul Ryan , Eric Cantor , and Kevin McCarthy are all a part of the same \u201c Young Guns \u201d movement , which developed a far-reaching strategy for implementing donor-class priorities . For instance , Cantor , McCarthy , and Ryan were all at the center of the 2013-2014 effort to push Marco Rubio \u2019 s amnesty agenda through the House after Rubio had succeeded in ushering an amnesty and mass immigration bill through the Senate .\nAlthough the threesome are closely aligned strategically , philosophically , and personally\u2013 it is Paul Ryan who has adopted the most extreme positions of the three in favor of open borders immigration policies , prompting Ryan to earn the endorsement of Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez .\nHowie Carr \u2019 s New England-wide talk show is syndicated to more than 20 stations throughout Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , and Connecticut .\nConservative icon and best-selling author Ann Coulter , who was a guest on Carr \u2019 s Friday program , reminded listeners about Paul Ryan \u2019 s record . Paul Ryan , along with Cantor and McCarthy , has pushed for unrestricted trade and immigration policies , fiscal deal-making with Obama , and a conciliatory approach with Congressional Democrats who rhetorically assail GOP voters on a daily basis .\nCoulter told listeners Ryan frequently \u201c brags \u201d about his ties to mentor , Jack Kemp , the former-New York Congressman and Bob Dole \u2019 s 1996 running mate .\nRyan \u2019 s association with Kemp is significant , because during the 1990s there was a Congressional fight about whether to slash immigration levels or continue increasing immigration levels .\nAt the time , National Review and many other conservatives argued that the U.S. federal policy of importing millions of new poor migrants on visas would be disastrous . In 1997 , National Review ran a cover story entitled \u201c Electing a New People \u201d which warned that American voters would be disenfranchised by the continued importation of millions of poor migrants on visas .\n\u201c The Republican hour is rapidly drawing to a close , \u201d the 1997 story reads , \u201c being drowned\u2014as a direct result of the 1965 Immigration Act . \u201d\nThere was even a bipartisan commission led by Civil Rights leader and Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan who argued that it was necessary to cut immigration in order to protect the national interest .\nThese bipartisan efforts failed , however , because a number of Republicans\u2013 including Kemp and Ryan\u2013 opposed them .\nAs Fred Barnes at The Weekly Standard has reported , Paul Ryan was so adamantly opposed to the then-bipartisan effort to crack down on immigration , that he penned a 4,000 word rebuttal to the National Review , which supported California \u2019 s Proposition 187 . Prop 187 was a popular ballot initiative , which would have prevented illegal aliens from accessing public benefits paid for by taxpayers . Shortly after the initiative was passed overwhelmingly by California voters , a federal judge blocked it .\nWhen National Review ran a cover story , \u2018 Why [ Jack ] Kemp and [ Bill ] Bennett Are Wrong on Immigration \u2019 in 1994 , Ryan wrote a 4,000-word rebuttal . It defended their opposition to Proposition 187 , which denied any social services for illegal immigrants in California .\nAs the National Review reported in 2013 , Paul Ryan seems particularly proud of the fact that he campaigned against the popular enforcement measure : \u201c \u2019 I actually campaigned with Jack Kemp against a thing called Prop 187 , \u2019 Ryan told host Raymond Arroyo . He said they both worried that the proposal would burn Republicans within the immigrant community , and \u2018 make it so that Latino voters would not hear the other messages of empowerment , ' \u201d The National Review wrote .\nWhile Paul Ryan has argued that more low-wage immigrant labor is needed to fill labor shortages , National Review \u2019 s Rich Lowry once declared , \u201c The next time I hear a Republican strategist or a Republican politician say that there are jobs that Americans won \u2019 t do , that person should be shot , he should be hanged , he should be wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the Potomac River . \u201d\nIronically , despite the fact that Paul Ryan is diametrically opposed to the National Review on the critical issue of immigration , the publication has since endorsed his run for Speaker of the House . In an editorial yesterday , the publication made a veiled allusion to Ryan \u2019 s support for open-borders , writing that \u201c He [ Ryan ] would have to commit to keeping immigration legislation that most Republicans oppose off the floor , whatever his own opinion of it . \u201d\nIn effect , National Review is arguing that their own preferred pick for House Speaker should remain silent on one of the most important issues facing the country . The publication doesn \u2019 t even consider the possibility of choosing a Speaker candidate who would make an affirmative case for restoring U.S. sovereignty , protecting American workers , and going out to media to stand up for the interests of blue-collar wage earners who are hurt by uncontrolled immigration . What \u2019 s more , National Review seems unconcerned that Paul Ryan as Speaker would not only mean that conservatives may have to fight to stop bad immigration legislation from passing , but it will also likely ensure that popular immigration enforcement measures ( such as blocking welfare for illegal immigrants ) will not move through the House .\nDuring Howie Carr \u2019 s program , Coulter delved more deeply into the psychology of Ryan \u2019 s relationship with Kemp . Coulter reminded listeners about Kemp \u2019 s performance in the October 9 , 1996 Vice Presidential debate in St. Petersberg , Florida .\n\u201c Anyone who is citing Jack Kemp\u2014 this is all you need to know about Jack Kemp : in his debate as a losing Vice Presidential candidate against Al Gore , Al Gore pulls that smarmy thing liberals will do to you sometime to smear your entire party . He congratulated Jack Kemp for not being a racist unlike the rest of his party . \u201d\nIn response to a question that touched on racism , Gore said , \u201c Throughout much of his career , Jack Kemp has been a powerful and needed voice against the kind of coarseness and incivility that you refer to in the question . I think it \u2019 s an extremely valuable service to have a voice within the Republican party who says we ought to be one nation\u2026 I compliment Mr. Kemp for the leadership he has shown in moving us away from that kind of attitude . \u201d\n\u201c Now what would someone like you or me say to that , Howie Carr ? \u201d Coulter asked . \u201c And what did Jack Kemp say ? \u201d\nKemp said , \u201c Well , I thank you , Al . I mean that very , very sincerely . \u201d\nCoulter concluded , \u201c [ Gore ] smeared the entire Republican Party and he was praising Jack Kemp for not being a racist like the rest of the Republican Party . This is the guy Paul Ryan\u2014who lost a debate to Joe Biden\u2014this is what he \u2019 s pushing out there . \u201d\nCoulter argued that if the Republican Party follows the Kemp-Ryan model , it will amount to \u201c suicide \u201d for the Republican Party .\nIndeed , today , nine out of every ten green cards the U.S. issues go to migrants from outside the Western world . The Democratic Party\u2014which champions Ryan \u2019 s immigration policies\u2014believe that their political platform will get a better reception from migrants from failed states like Ethiopia and Somalia than they will from American citizens who already live here .
