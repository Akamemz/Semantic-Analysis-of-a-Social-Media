    "content": "( CNN ) President Donald Trump and John McCain 's long-running feud is back in the spotlight following reports that White House and lower-level US Navy officials traded emails about keeping a warship named from the late senator 's father and grandfather out of sight ahead of the President 's trip to Japan .\nTwo Navy officials confirmed to CNN Wednesday night that the White House Military Office asked lower-level US Navy officials about keeping the ship out of view . One of the Navy officials further clarified Thursday morning that the discussion included obscuring the ship or moving it , which was not practical because the ship was under repairs at the time .\n`` Once leadership heard about it , they said knock it off , '' a senior Navy official told CNN .\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday morning before leaving the White House , Trump denied knowing about the plan and said that although he `` is not a big fan '' of McCain , he would n't have supported it .\n`` Now , somebody did it because they thought I did n't like him -- OK -- and they were well-meaning , I will say . I did n't know anything about it . I would never have done that , '' he said .\nThe ship ultimately was not moved nor was anything done to obscure McCain 's name , said Cmdr . Clay Doss , a spokesman for the 7th Fleet , and Trump tweeted Wednesday night that he was `` not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S . McCain . '' But the emails underscore Trump 's extraordinary and bitter personal feud with McCain , with whom he frequently sparred when the Arizona Republican was alive and even after he passed away from brain cancer in August .\nThe Journal reported Wednesday that a tarp was put in place to cover the ship 's name since it could not be moved due to repairs , but three Navy officials speaking to CNN pushed back on this claim .\n`` We did n't do anything to obstruct the name of the ship .
