    "content": "The Trump administration , with great fanfare , rolled out a new tax plan on Wednesday . It was neither particularly new nor truly a \u201c plan , \u201d at least not in the way that word is typically used in presidential politics . It actually tells us less about where Trump wants to take the tax code than his campaign plan did , which bodes poorly for anyone who hoped Trump was serious about a sweeping , pro-growth overhaul of the system .\nAmericans went to the polls last November not knowing a lot of important details about Donald Trump \u2019 s promise to deliver what he said would be the largest tax cut in US history . They didn \u2019 t know how that plan would guard against a wave of tax-evasion by high earners , or how it keep from adding trillions of dollars to the national debt , or \u2014 and this seemed especially important \u2014 how it would avoid actually raising taxes on 25 million Americans .\nSeven months have passed . Trump \u2019 s team has had a lot of time to fill in those blanks , which it promised to during the campaign but never did . But somehow , the one-page outline for tax reform that administration officials released on Wednesday managed to include fewer details than his campaign plan . It answered none of those questions from the fall , and it raised several new ones .\nThis is not how policymaking usually works \u2014 at least , not for policymakers who hope to pass actual laws .\n\u201c We \u2019 re just in theatrics mode , even though there \u2019 s a chance to do something , \u201d said Alan Cole , an economist at the conservative Tax Foundation , whose colleagues declared on Wednesday that the new Trump outline did not include enough details for them to complete a full economic analysis of it .\nTrump officials \u201c still think of , how does stuff play on cable news ? \u201d Cole added . \u201c They \u2019 ve built a culture that \u2019 s not ideologically predisposed to listening to someone who cares about little details . \u2026 It feels like we \u2019 re kind of in a perpetual campaign , and as a result , there \u2019 s no policy . \u201d\nSkimping on details is a great way to undercut real reform\nCole , and many others like him , has high hopes for a truly bold tax reform bill \u2014 one that encourages growth , investment , and income gains across the economy . Many supply-side economists will tell you that to be effective , those reforms need to be permanent , and not set to expire after a few years , so that companies can invest and hire with confidence .\nThis is the first of many , many rubs for the Trump plan . To cut taxes permanently in Washington , you either need to clear 60 votes in the Senate , or you need to clear 50 , but not increase the deficit outside of a 10-year window . Trump appears to have done none of the outreach to Democrats that he would need to get 60 votes . That leaves the 50-vote route , via budget reconciliation , and the easiest way through it is designing a plan that Congress \u2019 s tax-scorers will deem revenue-neutral ( when accounting for a boost to economic growth from the cuts ) .\nTrump is nowhere close to such a plan , going by the details he \u2019 s put forth . Doing some back-of-the-envelope math , Cole estimates he \u2019 s proposing around $ 2 trillion to $ 3 trillion in net tax cuts \u2014 rate cuts minus offsetting loophole closures . He thinks the plan might generate about $ 1 trillion in added revenues from growth . That would still leave Trump short .\nAgain , this is a rough estimate , and if anything it \u2019 s optimistic \u2014 it comes from a think tank that typically projects much higher growth gains from tax cuts than its peers .\nTrump \u2019 s team could solve this , theoretically , by producing its own modeling showing massive growth effects from the plan . It could even persuade senators to adopt that model for the purposes of reconciliation . But \u2014 ugh , here it is again \u2014 you can \u2019 t model a plan without details .\nYou need to estimate , for example , how many high-earning workers might suddenly file their taxes as a so-called \u201c pass-through \u201d business in order to take advantage of the administration \u2019 s proposed 15 percent tax rate for such businesses and drastically cut their tax bills . The Trump team says it will limit that practice \u2014 restrict the rate to actual businesses , not workers who can declare themselves LLCs \u2014 but it won \u2019 t say how , and so , it \u2019 s impossible to predict how successful that limitation might be , which matters a lot for tax revenues .\n\u201c Their answer to that is , no , trust us , we \u2019 ll fix it , \u201d said Harry Stein , the director of fiscal policy at the liberal Center for American Progress . Stein does not take that promise seriously . But , he said , \u201c I do take ( the plan ) seriously as an intent to enact enormous tax cuts for wealthy people and big corporations . \u201d\nThe plan leaves huge questions for the middle class , especially\nThis is another rub for Trump . His officials are selling the plan as a big boost to the middle class . But while the new outline is clear on its cuts for businesses , it does not specify the income thresholds for each of its three personal tax rates . It increases the standard deduction , though not by as much as Trump originally promised , and it eliminates most other deductions , but it also appears to eliminate some deductions that particularly benefit larger middle-class families with children .\nThat combination is what led Lily Batchelder , a New York University professor and former Obama economic adviser , to calculate the effects on the middle class . She said that some 25 million low- or middle-income families could see their taxes go up under Trump \u2019 s campaign proposal . To which Trump \u2019 s team responded , no , they won \u2019 t \u2014 our plan will ensure it .\nSuch assurances were nowhere to be found in the plan released on Wednesday .\nAfter its release , Batchelder said in an interview that \u201c the changes announced today could have been written on a business card , \u201d but by carrying over some assumptions from the campaign plan , she could roughly estimate its effects .\n\u201c It appears to me that it \u2019 s worse for the middle class , and that more working families will face a tax increase , \u201d she said . \u201c I , or many tax nerds , could have fixed this in a matter of hours . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s a lack of staff . It \u2019 s a lack of will . \u201d\nIn call after call with economic experts on Wednesday afternoon , no matter their ideology or party affiliation , this was the constant question : Why didn \u2019 t the administration sweat more of the small stuff ? Or even more of the big stuff ?\nIt appears \u201c they didn \u2019 t put much thought into this , and then last week , Trump announced they were doing a plan , \u201d said Stan Veuger , an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just not well done . I don \u2019 t know what else to say about it . It \u2019 s hard to tell what goal we \u2019 re working toward . \u201d\nTrump has seen this move on Obamacare already , and it didn \u2019 t go well\nOn Wednesday , administration officials stressed the time and preparation that had gone into the plan before they rolled it out .\n\u201c This is quite an historic day for us , and one that we have been looking forward to for a long time , \u201d said Gary Cohn , the head of the National Economic Council .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been working on this plan for a considerable amount of time , \u201d said Steven Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary .\nAnd yet , Mnuchin swatted away request after request from reporters during a White House briefing on the plan , saying the administration would tell Americans more once it had reached a deal with Congress . `` You 're going into very micro details here , '' he told a questioner at one point .\nIf that sounds familiar , it \u2019 s because the administration took a similar tact on its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare .\nTrump never detailed his preferences on the issue publicly , failed to unify Republicans around a bill , and has seen the issue languish in the House .
