I live in Berkeley , California , a liberal town in a liberal state , and in those years , I tried to step into the shoes of those living in a deeply conservative town , a center of the petrochemical industry : Lake Charles , in a conservative state , Louisiana . It \u2019 s a story I tell in my 2016 book , Strangers in Their Own Land : Anger and Mourning on the American Right . Nearly all the people I came to know voted for Donald Trump \u2014 most with hope and excitement . Since the book came out , I \u2019 ve returned to Louisiana three times , perused my Facebook feed and invited some to my own home to learn if and how their feelings have changed over the course of President Trump \u2019 s first year . As Trump \u2019 s efforts to \u201c make America great again \u201d paradoxically pull us apart , I wondered : Was there hope that we would not lose each other ?\nIt is not difficult to see that the wedge between Republicans and Democrats is formidable . According to a recent Pew survey , 71 % of Democrats believe the government should do more to help the needy ; only 24 % of Republicans do . Sixty-four percent of Democrats think discrimination is the main reason blacks can \u2019 t get ahead ; only 14 % of Republicans do . Eighty-four percent of Democrats believe immigrants strengthen the country with their work ethic and talent ; only 42 % of Republicans do . The average gap between Democrats and Republicans on ten subjects has grown from 15 % in 1994 to 36 % in 2017 . Two decades back , the blue-red divide on a range of issues was about as wide as that between blacks and whites ( about 14 % typically ) ; today it is much wider .\nA year after they voted for Trump , all the Trump supporters I talked to remained committed to him . Some did so with a sigh : \u201c Why can \u2019 t he stop tweeting ? \u201d \u201c Why can \u2019 t he be more presidential ? \u201d But others had risen up as defiant moral bodyguards . When Trump was quoted as speaking of some African nations as \u201c shithole nations , \u201d saying Haitians \u201c all have AIDS \u201d and describing Norwegian newcomers as desirable , many of his supporters felt embarrassed for him and by him . But one Louisianan I knew responded , \u201c I \u2019 m sorry but those African countries are terrible places to live , \u201d and another angrily rebuked Trump \u2019 s critics on Facebook , \u201c Democrats feign horror when Trump calls a COUNTRY a \u2018 shithole \u2019 but praise Hillary for calling a PEOPLE deplorable , \u201d and again , \u201c You \u2019 re a Democrat if you think its horrible that Trump called a country a \u2018 shithole , \u2019 but that its okay to murder an unborn child. \u201d Surely people have seen members of both parties furiously pointing out the moral hypocrisies of their opponents .\nIt is harder to see , but a nationwide grass-roots movement has been quietly growing , and it seeks not to eliminate difference but to remove its bitter edge . The first signs I saw of this came as email messages from my readers . One woman wrote , \u201c I \u2019 m part of an Episcopalian congregation here in western Massachusetts . Can you put me in touch with a congregation in Lake Charles ? \u201d Another woman said , \u201c I live on a dairy farm in Kansas , in a conservative state , and I \u2019 d liked to get some high school kids from California to see how we live out here. \u201d When a Trump supporter I profiled in Strangers came with her children to visit my family in Berkeley , we conducted an 8-person right-meets-left \u201c Living-room Conversation \u201d \u2014 part of a project that \u2019 s the brainchild of a local mediation lawyer , Joan Blades \u2014 to see if we could find common ground on how to clean up the environment . We began by going around the room , each person , left and right sharing his or her personal goals for America , and for its environment and found them fairly similar \u2014 though as the conversation we wandered between points of agreement ( clean energy ) and disagreement ( the government subsidizing clean energy ) . Usually in Livingroom Conversations , the group meets eight times , though we could only meet once . And while we experienced no aha-breakthrough moment , all of us felt glad we \u2019 d tried .\nEven among the most ardent and extreme people I met over five years of research in Louisiana , I found specific issues on which there was potential for coalition \u2014 for example , safeguarding children on the Internet , reducing prison populations for non-violent offenders , protecting against commercialization of the human genome , pushing for good jobs and re-building our rail system , roads , bridges \u2013 America \u2019 s infrastructure . In fact , most of my Louisiana Trump supporters wanted to mend its social infrastructure too .\nSigns of a desire to reach out extend far beyond my inbox and living room . Listed on the website of the Bridge Alliance , a non-profit non-partisan umbrella group , are over seventy cross-partisan groups based in towns scattered across the country with such names as Common Good , Better Angels , American Public Square , AllSides . Virtually all of these small groups rose from local efforts to restore a culture of respect while exploring potential points of agreement . Common ground is there to be explored . By some estimates , over one in ten people who voted for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary ended up voting for Trump in the presidential election .
