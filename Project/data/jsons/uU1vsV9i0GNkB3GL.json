    "content": "( CNN ) -- Emma Watson lent her name and her glittery profile to the cause of feminism at the United Nations , and in the process got places that rarely cover this eight-letter `` f '' word to pay attention .\n`` How can we effect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation ? '' Watson said in a speech about gender equality that received a standing ovation and has gone viral . `` Men -- I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation . Gender equality is your issue , too , '' she said .\nRarely do `` E ! Online '' and U.N. Women tweet the same speech . But this was n't just any speech . It focused on the role of men and questioned the demonization of the term `` feminism . ''\n`` Why has the word become such an uncomfortable one ? I think it is right I am paid the same as my male counterparts . I think it is right that I should make decisions about my own body . I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life . I think it is right that socially , I am afforded the same respect as men , '' Watson said .\n`` My life is a sheer privilege because my parents did n't love me less because I was born a daughter . My school did not limit me because I was a girl . My mentors did n't assume that I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day . These influences are the gender equality ambassadors that made me who I am today . They may not know it but they are the inadvertent feminists needed in the world today . We need more of those . ''\nWatson gave the speech in light of the U.N. launch of the HeForShe campaign , which aims to engage men to stop violence against women .\nWe live in a world in which 100 million girls globally are expected to be married off before age 18 in the next 10 years , a world in which even in the United States a girl can find herself plucked against her will from a New York classroom and forced by relatives to marry against her will in a country she has never known , a world in which 31 million girls of elementary school age remain out of school , a world in which two-thirds of the world 's 774 million illiterate citizens are female .\nIndeed , Watson 's star is only the latest to illuminate the rebranding of feminism .
