    "content": "Hours after Democrats accused Carter Page of being a Russian asset at a 2017 hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , the former Trump campaign adviser received a chilling voicemail .\nThe caller screamed an expletive-laced tirade and threatened to beat him to death .\n\u201c If it was up to me , after we [ expletive ] tried you for treason , we \u2019 d take you out in the street and beat the [ expletive ] piss out of you with baseball bats , you [ expletive ] sucking mother [ expletive ] , \u201d the unknown caller said , according to a transcript Mr . Page filed in court documents in a separate case . \u201c Next time you turn your back on your [ expletive ] country , you \u2019 ll [ expletive ] regret it . \u201d\nThe call , one of several from the same Oklahoma number , is one of hundreds of death threats aimed at Mr . Page since special counsel Robert Mueller began investigating the 2016 presidential election nearly two years ago .\nMr. Mueller has found plenty of wrongdoing . He has filed more than 100 public charges against 34 individuals and three companies .\nBut he also has left a lot of collateral damage in his wake . People who have never been charged have endured endless harassment , crippling legal bills and collapsing businesses .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a life or death situation . I can \u2019 t walk out on the street because of the threats , \u201d Mr . Page told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nMichael Caputo , a communications consultant who worked on the Trump campaign , said his nightmare began after the same March 2017 House hearing that Mr . Page singled out .\nDuring that hearing , Rep. Jackie Speier , California Democrat , referred to Mr. Caputo as Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s \u201c image consultant . \u201d\n\u201c That comment changed our lives forever , \u201d he said . \u201c The more this bogus investigation unfolded , the more my family suffers . When this is over \u2014 if it is ever over \u2014 where do I go to get my reputation back ? There is no office of reputation restoration . \u201d\nHe stopped counting after the threats to him topped 50 .\nThe vileness has arrived through letters , phone calls and social media . One person vowed to burn his house to the ground while his children were inside . Another said , \u201c When someone puts a bullet in your head , I will piss on your head . A Twitter user told him , \u201c Me running into you and smashing your [ expletive ] head open is optimal , but you going broke will d [ o ] . \u201d\n\u201c I have three children , and my family lives in fear , \u201d Mr. Caputo said . \u201c All of this has happened to me , and I \u2019 m just a witness . I \u2019 m not a central player . \u201d\n\u201c Welcome to the crowd . We get death threats all the time , \u201d she told The Times . \u201c Do you want me to show you the list of death threats I have ? \u201d\nShe said she stands by her claim that Mr. Caputo has connections to Mr. Putin and insisted that his company worked to improve the Russian leader \u2019 s image in the U.S .\nMr. Caputo said it \u2019 s not true . His public relations firm did business with former Russian President Boris Yeltsin , but not Mr. Putin . He highlighted several op-ed pieces he has written that were critical of Mr. Putin .\n\u201c All she has to do is look at what I \u2019 ve written to know that I \u2019 m no ally of Putin , but she \u2019 s too lazy or too busy to do that , \u201d he said .\nFearing for his family \u2019 s safety , Mr. Caputo has installed a high-tech security system in his home and office , which includes shotguns installed in wall safes that can be accessed with the touch of a button . He said he also carries handguns with him and has reduced his travel by 90 percent .\nHe also has formed a quick-reaction force of friends who have promised to respond at a moment \u2019 s notice . Mr. Caputo said one text could deliver 50 people to his house in less than 10 minutes , if necessary .\nShane Krieger , the police chief in Mr. Caputo \u2019 s hometown , confirmed that local authorities have investigated threats directed at the former Trump adviser and said officers keep an eye on his house during overnight shifts .\nMost of the threats have been untraceable , although officers did speak to a person who sent Mr. Caputo \u201c vulgar and obscene \u201d Facebook messages about his daughter , according to police reports reviewed by The Times . The suspect was deemed as not a serious threat and released with a warning .\nMr . Page said he has reported the Oklahoma calls to the FBI and handed over audio recordings . He said he is frustrated with the lack of response and expressed his dismay in a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray that went unanswered .\n\u201c The FBI has blown it off , and they kept getting worse , \u201d Mr . Page said of the calls , which persisted for about a year and a half .\nLast week , Mr . Page sent a letter to Sen. James Lankford , a Republican who represents Oklahoma , the origin of some of the threatening calls , hoping he would pressure the FBI to act .\nOther Trump campaign officials who have appeared before Mr. Mueller \u2019 s team say the special counsel is aware of the threats and takes them seriously , and is assisting witnesses in reporting intimidation efforts to the FBI .\nPeter Carr , a spokesman for Mr. Mueller , declined to comment .\nAn FBI spokeswoman said the agency does not confirm or deny investigations .\nLike Ms. Speier \u2019 s public comments , news accounts or other media appearances seem to spur some of the vitriol .\nMr . Page noticed that some of the threatening calls from the Oklahoma number coincided with articles or television appearances by Ali Watkins , a reporter who had a romantic relationship with James Wolfe , a former security director for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .\nProsecutors said Wolfe fed Ms. Watkins inside information about Mr . Page . Wolfe was never charged with leaking , but he did plead guilty to lying about his contacts with reporters .\nMr . Page said he believes Wolfe bears responsibility for some of the threats he faces , and he made that request of the judge overseeing Wolfe \u2019 s case . It was not mentioned as a factor in Wolfe \u2019 s sentencing .\nAnother former Trump campaign official , J.D . Gordon , confirmed to The Times that he has received threats and reported the four worst to the FBI cybercrimes unit . He said when he calls a ride-hailing service , he gives the address of a local train station or church to shield his home address .\nRichard Pinedo was not part of the Trump orbit , but he also has faced blowback for his role in the Russia meddling saga . He was sentenced to six months in prison for selling fake identities to the 13 Russians indicted by Mr. Mueller for meddling in the 2016 election .\nWhen he was arrested , he was harassed by people on the left accusing him of being a traitor , his attorney told the court . But when Pinedo pleaded guilty and cooperated with Mr. Mueller \u2019 s team , those on the right started attacking him .\nClint Van Zandt , a former FBI profiler , said the dueling reactions reflect the polarized political environment .\n\u201c Unfortunately , today in America if you are liberal or conservative , you are either loved or hated , \u201d he said . \u201c There is no in between because we \u2019 ve lost that respect for one another . \u201d\nHe said authorities must evaluate the threats on a case-by-case basis .\n\u201c Someone who is going to kill you usually doesn \u2019 t tell you , \u201d he said . \u201c But if a death threat appears to know someone \u2019 s routine , where their kids go to school or what kind of car they drive , then they have my attention . \u201d\nMr. Caputo said his public relations business \u2019 largest client dropped him , citing harassment over its ties to him . He has lost 50 percent of revenue and had to lay off half his staff , close one office and consolidate his remaining employees into an office one-third the size of their previous location .\n\u201c My legal costs are over $ 200,000 , but the lost opportunity costs are probably triple that , \u201d he said .\nMr . Page said businesses he started have been \u201c demolished \u201d because the publicity surrounding his case has made it nearly impossible to attract clients . He declined to discuss his legal costs beyond describing them as a \u201c large number . \u201d\nJerome Corsi , who was questioned by Mr. Mueller \u2019 s team , said he has not experienced the harassment directed at others , aside from a few people on social media telling him that he is going to jail . But economically , he is feeling similar pain as others ensnared in the Russia investigation .\nMr. Corsi said he now has no monthly income and is embroiled in a legal battle with his former employer , InfoWars , over his termination last year . The taint of the Russia investigation has made him too toxic for any potential employer .\nThe client drain has even spread to relatives of people associated with the Russia investigation .\nPinedo said clients of his father \u2019 s boss demanded that he be fired because \u201c he \u2019 s a traitor to this country . \u201d",
