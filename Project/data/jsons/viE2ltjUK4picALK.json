    "content": "Perhaps the strangest thing about John Boehner 's lawsuit trying to rein in Barack Obama 's use of unilateral executive authority is how plainly welcome the White House finds it .\n`` You 're going to sue me for doing my job ? '' Obama himself mocked when the plan was first announced , speaking to supporters at a rally . The White House pushed reporters to write stories about the lawsuit , and rapidly had Democrats even buzzing about impeachment . It 's easy enough to understand why the White House does n't fear this lawsuit . As Andrew Prokop has explained , the odds of the House GOP prevailing in court are miniscule . But it 's more than that . Obama is thrilled he 's getting sued , because public attention on the lawsuit actually solves the administration 's biggest problem .\nSince Republicans took the House in 2010 , Obama 's basic political challenge has been that average American voters have a pretty poor grasp of the fundamental operation of the US constitutional order . People expect the government to do things to make their lives better , and when that does n't happen , they grow angry at the person in the White House . When the president 's agenda gets stymied in congress , people do n't want to hear about filibusters or the Speaker 's ability to keep bills from getting to the floor . They ask why the president is n't leading and getting things done .\nThat 's why , in recent years , Obama has n't just relied on unilateral executive action to advance his policy aims \u2014 he 's tried really hard to highlight his executive actions . Every president has always used this kind of authority . But Obama has tried to brand it , tying this agenda together under the banner We Ca n't Wait . The problem is that , objectively , it 's been difficult to attract substantial public attention to these We Ca n't Wait initiatives because they tend to be rather small-bore .\nUnder the circumstances , the specter of a United States Congress literally picking a high-profile political fight over the idea that the president has been doing too much stuff is manna from heaven . Now there 's no more argument over why the president wo n't lead . He is leading ! Leading as far as he can possibly go !
