    "content": "The outpouring , 50 years later , has been nothing short of remarkable .\nThe media are awash in Jack Kennedy tributes , specials , documentaries , books and essays , conjuring up how he lived and how he died . There is an enduring fascination with Camelot , the myth enshrined after his death , and with the myriad theories and counter-theories about Lee Harvey Oswald and that awful day in Dallas .\nBut a partisan battle has also erupted over this question : Was Kennedy really and truly a liberal ?\nWhy , one might ask , does this question still have resonance ? Is it just a way to transpose the politics of 1963 to our 21st-century era of constant political warfare ?\nSure , but it goes deeper than that . Although Kennedy \u2019 s accomplishments were meager in his thousand days , he retains a powerful hold on our imagination . This is in part because he was cut down in his prime , creating a sense of a dream unfulfilled . And though he was a lifelong Democrat , each side wants to claim his legacy .\nBaby boomers , who are forever reliving the sixties , bear part of the blame . But the Kennedy memory obviously has a hold on many who were born well after he died , some of whom want to convert his magic to their cause .\nBoston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby makes the case for the right :\n\u201c As Democrats maneuvering for the 2016 presidential race , there isn \u2019 t one who would think of disparaging John F. Kennedy \u2019 s stature as a Democratic Party hero . Yet it \u2019 s a pretty safe bet that none would dream of running on Kennedy \u2019 s approach to government or embrace his political beliefs .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s Democratic Party \u2014 the home of Barack Obama , John Kerry , and Al Gore \u2014 wouldn \u2019 t give the time of day to a candidate like JFK .\n\u201c The 35th president was an ardent tax-cutter who championed across-the-board , top-to-bottom reductions in personal and corporate tax rates , slashed tariffs to promote free trade , and even spoke out against the \u2018 confiscatory \u2019 property taxes being levied in too many cities . He was anything but a big-spending , welfare-state liberal . \u2018 I do not believe that Washington should do for the people what they can do for themselves through local and private effort , \u2019 Kennedy bluntly avowed during the 1960 campaign . \u201d\nThat is also the theme of this National Review piece by James Pierson , examining Ira Stoll \u2019 s book \u201c JFK , Conservative \u201d :\n\u201c Now Ira Stoll comes along to make the startling case that JFK was not a liberal at all , but in reality a conservative who ( had he lived ) might have endorsed Ronald Reagan for president and today might be comfortably at home writing editorials for National Review .
