    "content": "In the fall of 1998 , it seemed like President Clinton was in trouble . An investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr had uncovered an affair between the president and White House intern Monica Lewinsky . And after months of denials , Clinton finally admitted to having had \u201c an inappropriate relationship \u201d with Lewinsky , which was then recounted in graphic detail in the report Starr sent to Congress . The affair and the president \u2019 s attempts to hide it were quickly denounced by Republicans and Democrats alike . In a speech on the Senate floor , then-Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman said Clinton \u2019 s conduct was \u201c disgraceful \u201d and \u201c immoral. \u201d Just a few weeks later , the House voted to open an impeachment inquiry , with the support of 31 Democrats .\nMonths later , though , Clinton hadn \u2019 t just survived the impeachment process \u2014 he had managed to weather it with high approval ratings and the backing of his party . Despite bipartisan rumblings of displeasure with the president as the inquiry took off , public support never really coalesced behind impeachment , and the effort was ultimately perceived by many as a partisan attack by House Republicans bent on taking down a political opponent .\nSo as the Democrats plunge forward with their impeachment inquiry , Clinton \u2019 s failed impeachment looms as a cautionary tale . After all , no Republicans at this point have come out in support of an impeachment inquiry , which means Democrats will arguably have even more work to do to convince the public that the allegations against President Trump aren \u2019 t merely political . And although support for impeachment is on the upswing , it \u2019 s hard to predict if that will last \u2014 or if public opinion will just ossify along familiar partisan lines , as it did during Clinton \u2019 s impeachment .\nIt \u2019 s tempting to think of Trump \u2019 s impeachment as a sequel of sorts , but there are already signs that what \u2019 s happening today could unfold quite differently . For one thing , the case against Clinton hinged on the findings in Starr \u2019 s report . By contrast , today \u2019 s Democrats didn \u2019 t choose to orient their inquiry around findings in special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s report that examined misconduct by Trump : They are instead building a case against the president in real time , which makes it harder to predict where the public will ultimately land .\nAnd although there \u2019 s still a significant risk that the investigation will be perceived as partisan , the nature of the allegations against Trump are quite different . Many Americans saw Clinton \u2019 s affair with Lewinsky as a \u201c private matter , \u201d but Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is much more clearly tied to his role as commander-in-chief . So it \u2019 s entirely possible that the public will be less forgiving this time .\nBy the time the House of Representatives voted to open an impeachment inquiry against Clinton in October 1998 , the allegations against the president had been in the news for months . Clinton had publicly confessed to the affair in August , and in mid-September , Starr delivered his lengthy and salacious report \u2014 which included a case for impeaching Clinton \u2014 to Congress .\nAt that moment , support for impeachment seemed like it might be on the upswing . A Gallup poll conducted in mid-October , just after the House voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry , found that 48 percent of the public supported the decision to hold hearings . But as the chart below shows , support for impeachment didn \u2019 t continue to tick upward . In mid-December , when the House voted to impeach Clinton on two counts of perjury and obstruction of justice , just about 40 percent of the public continued to think he should be impeached \u2014 and the same was true in February , when the Senate voted to acquit him .\nThis didn \u2019 t stop Republicans from raking Clinton over the coals in the lead-up to the 1998 midterm elections , though . That \u2019 s perhaps because there was one segment of the public that did see an uptick in support for impeachment \u2014 Republican voters . In mid-August 1998 , an ABC News poll found that only 38 percent of Republicans thought Clinton should be impeached and removed from office . But by the time the House had voted to impeach him , about two-thirds of Republicans were on board . The GOP \u2019 s attacks , though , didn \u2019 t seem to have the effect of boosting overall support for impeachment ; if anything , it just resulted in a widening partisan divide .\nClinton \u2019 s presidential approval ratings were also high when the scandal started to unravel , and they remained remarkably undented throughout the impeachment process . Approval of his job performance had been hovering between 60 and 70 percent through most of 1998 , and with the exception of a small dip around the time the Starr report was released in September , they stayed above 60 percent . In fact , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s tracker of presidential approval , Clinton \u2019 s approval ratings hit 67 percent at the end of December 1998 , just after he was impeached by the House . It was among the highest job approval ratings he received at any point in his administration .\nThere were other signs , too , that the public didn \u2019 t think Clinton should be removed from office . Republicans \u2019 efforts to impeach Clinton appeared to be dramatically backfiring in real time \u2014 after running a slew of ads attacking Clinton in the lead-up to the midterms , they lost seats and House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who had been one of Clinton \u2019 s loudest critics , resigned the speakership .\nThat electoral loss has been woven , over the years , into a cautionary fable about the costs of impeachment without broad public support . But , of course , Clinton himself didn \u2019 t emerge unscathed \u2014 Americans generally disapproved of his handling of the scandal and questioned his integrity , and those sentiments may have hurt Democrats in the 2000 election . So while it \u2019 s difficult to evaluate whether the Republicans or the Democrats paid more of a price in the long term , the impeachment process clearly left a mark on both .\nSome Democrats were unhappy with Clinton , but not enough to support impeachment\nIt wasn \u2019 t always clear that Democrats would stand by Clinton . Some distanced themselves from the president in the lead-up to the midterm elections ; others even questioned whether he should resign . The initial vote to refer Starr \u2019 s report to the House Judiciary Committee for further investigation passed by an overwhelming margin . And when the House voted a few weeks later to open a formal impeachment inquiry , 31 moderate Democrats were in support . \u201c Many Democrats were angry and frustrated that their leader had lied to them , \u201d said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University . \u201c That softened them to the idea of at least having an investigation . \u201d\nBut after a fairly brief period , the House was divided once again into familiar partisan camps . By the time the House voted on the articles of impeachment against Clinton just five Democrats voted to impeach the president . And when it was the Senate \u2019 s turn to decide whether Clinton should remain in office , only Republicans crossed the aisle , with 10 GOP senators voting to acquit Clinton on at least one of the charges .\nWhy did Democrats fall in line behind Clinton ? The Republicans \u2019 aggressive pursuit of impeachment \u2014 even in the absence of a clear public consensus \u2014 may have pushed Democrats to close ranks . \u201c A significant number of Democrats thought there should be some consequence for Clinton \u2019 s behavior , like a formal censure vote , \u201d said Philip Bobbitt , a professor of law at Columbia University and the coauthor of \u201c Impeachment : A Handbook. \u201d \u201c But when it became clear that the Republicans were just going for impeachment , they became much more defensive . \u201d\nClinton also did damage control of his own . After first trying to quickly move past the scandal , he delivered an extravagant apology for his conduct on the day Starr \u2019 s report was released , saying he had \u201c sinned \u201d and \u201c repented. \u201d That apparent contrition may have helped some Democrats rally around him , although others remained angry with him throughout the process . As late as February , Sen. Dianne Feinstein \u2014 who months earlier had said her confidence in Clinton \u2019 s credibility was \u201c shattered \u201d by the revelation of the affair \u2014 pushed for a bipartisan vote in the Senate to censure Clinton . But as upset as Democrats might have been with Clinton for having the affair , or for trying to conceal it , they continued to support the president , bolstered by the fact that public opinion was largely on their side .\n\u201c By the end , very few Democrats , even if they disliked Clinton , were willing to say his behavior was worthy of impeachment , \u201d Zelizer said . \u201c And many Republicans in the Senate had the same misgivings . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s dangerous to draw too many parallels between what happened then and what \u2019 s occurring in Congress now . For one thing , the Democrats are still in the early stages of their inquiry . But experts told me that there are some lessons for today \u2019 s Democrats in the story of Clinton \u2019 s impeachment .\nFirst , there is the risk that , like the Republicans in Clinton \u2019 s impeachment , the Democrats \u2019 investigation into Trump could be seen primarily as an attack on a political adversary .
