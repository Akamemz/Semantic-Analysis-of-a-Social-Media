Since 2012 , Netanyahu \u2019 s favorability rating has jumped a full 10 points , while his unfavorable rating has risen an insignificant 1 % .\nThe latest favorability ratings for Obama come from a Feb 23 Economist/YouGov poll that shows Obama tied with Netanyahu in favorability with 45 % , but with an unfavorable rating of more than double that of Netanyahu \u2019 s at 50 % . This is a poll of 1000 adults . Gallup polled 837 adults .\nAs far as job approval , according to the most recent Gallup poll Obama sits at 44 % approve , 51 % disapprove .\nNetanyahu \u2019 s jump in approval is a massive failure for a mainstream media that has red-lined in its attempts to derail Netanyahu \u2019 s much-anticipated Tuesday speech before both chambers of Congress .\nThe very same media that champions Obama \u2019 s lawless crusades around Congress is now comically furious over a breach of diplomatic protocol that saw House Speaker John Boehner invite Netanyahu to speak without first alerting a president \u2014 a president who his currently writing the laws he wants and violating his Constitutional oath by refusing to enforce those he doesn \u2019 t .\nThe media did everything in its power to promote a failed boycott of the speech by Democratic lawmakers ( so far only about 10 % have refused to attend ) and to paint those who support Netanyahu \u2019 s speech as disloyal to President Obama , and by extension America .\nThe media has been on a McCarthyist rampage all year ; brutally punishing anyone they perceive as disloyal to Obama . On top of these attacks against Netanyahu and his American supporters for defying The King , the media spent a full week blasting Rudy Giuliani for questioning Obama \u2019 s patriotism .
