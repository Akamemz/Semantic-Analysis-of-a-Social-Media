Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 . You can unsubscribe at any time .\nDemocrats \u2014 from Virginia to Texas \u2014 have voted at historic rates in the past year . That continued enthusiasm in southwestern Pennsylvania is a key element to Lamb \u2019 s success : If the pattern of higher rates of Democratic turnout holds , the Monmouth poll shows his lead swelling to 6 points , versus just a 2-point advantage under a more conservative turnout scenario .\n\u201c Our people would drive through a rainstorm or a snowstorm to get to the polls , \u201d Lamb said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Saturday , calling the momentum `` palpable . '' ( Some light snow is likely on Tuesday , but only minor accumulations , if any , are in the forecast . )\nThis traditionally blue-collar district is ancestrally Democratic \u2014 the party has a 6-point registration edge in the district \u2014 with a solid block of union-affiliated voters . But it 's voted reliably Republican over the past decade . Former GOP Rep. Tim Murphy \u2014 who resigned amid a sex scandal last year \u2014 held the seat for 15 years , with Democrats not even fielding a candidate in 2016 or 2014 . At the presidential level , Mitt Romney won the district by double digits in 2012 , and Trump crushed it here in 2016 .\nRepublicans are banking on Trump \u2019 s multiple visits to the district , along with a stream of top surrogates , to energize the base on behalf of Saccone . The president , who called Saccone a \u201c very fine human being , \u201d urged voters at his Saturday night rally to \u201c vote like crazy \u201d on Tuesday .\nBut if GOP voters sit it out , you can expect questions about Trump \u2019 s ability to activate his own coalition for other down-ballot candidates .\nTo win , Lamb needs to run up his totals in Allegheny County , where Pittsburgh bleeds into the suburbs \u2014 the bluest part of the 18th Congressional District . In particular , former state Democratic Party Chairman Jim Burn said to watch the southern half of the district , which leans more conservative .\n\u201c If Saccone does poorly there in southern Allegheny right out of the gate , \u201d that \u2019 s a \u201c bad sign for him , \u201d Burn said , adding that Lamb \u2019 s political family , which hails from the area , has built up name recognition there \u201c that \u2019 s well-respected by both parties. \u201d In the 1970s , Lamb \u2019 s grandfather served as the Democratic leader in the state Senate , and his uncle is Pittsburgh \u2019 s city controller .\nBut Saccone \u2019 s state legislative district , which he \u2019 s represented for almost a decade , overlaps with these Allegheny County suburbs , so Republicans believe he won \u2019 t cede as much ground here as Lamb \u2019 s team hopes . Saccone must also run up his margin in the three largely rural counties : Westmoreland , Washington and Greene .\nLamb has also made a push for these rural areas , opening campaign offices in all four counties . He \u2019 s also spent a lot of time in Greene County , home to a lot of coal miners who were \u201c really anti-Hillary \u201d but are \u201c open to Conor , \u201d said Rich Yakubic , a 67-year-old member of the United Mine Workers of America , who attended Lamb \u2019 s rally in Waynesburg , Pennsylvania , on Sunday .\nRepublicans believe that tax reform will be a signature issue for maintaining their majority in 2018 , which will be put to its first electoral test in Pennsylvania .\nBut Republicans have backed away from using that line of attack against Lamb in TV ads in recent weeks . From Feb. 4 to Feb. 11 , roughly two-thirds of broadcast TV ads from Saccone \u2019 s campaign , Congressional Leadership Fund and the National Republican Congressional Committee dealt with taxes , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of Advertising Analytics data . For the week of Feb. 18 , that dropped to 36 percent , and to 14 percent the week after . Since the beginning of March , tax ads have been essentially non-existent .\nInstead , those groups are opting to focus on Lamb \u2019 s tenure as a federal prosecutor , accusing him of negotiating plea bargains for drug dealers .\nTrump announced tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum , a move that should appeal to areas of western Pennsylvania . The president touted those tariffs in his Saturday night rally , emphasizing them again in a tweet on Monday as a reason to back Saccone , who will \u201c be much better for steel and business . \u201d\nBut both candidates support Trump \u2019 s tariffs , making the announcement a bit of a wash in the district . And the polling finds little impact on the race : According to the Monmouth poll , 96 percent of voters said the president \u2019 s tariffs decision hasn \u2019 t caused them to change their choice of candidate . Three percent said the tariffs make them more likely to vote for Saccone , while 1 percent said they are more likely to back Lamb .\nBoth parties have handled the debate over gun rights in unexpected ways .\nLamb has tried to strike a more moderate tone . He 's demurred on more robust restrictions on gun ownership . But his campaign is testing whether support for stronger background checks can work in a conservative district , running an eleventh-hour advertisement touting his efforts `` to keep guns from criminals and people in need of mental health treatment '' and calling Saccone `` so extreme he 's fought to eliminate Pennsylvania 's background check system to buy a gun . ''\nRepublicans , meanwhile , hope to chip away at Lamb \u2019 s support among hardcore liberals by spotlighting his support for some gun rights in mailers \u2014 a strategy outside groups could use elsewhere to meddle in crowded Democratic primaries . \u201c Thank you Conor Lamb for opposing gun restrictions , \u201d one Congressional Leadership Fund mailer says .\nBurn , the former state Democratic Party chairman , insisted the tactic \u201c doesn \u2019 t work here because Democrats will see through it , \u201d he said . \u201c You \u2019 re in western Pennsylvania , so there \u2019 s a lot of gun owners out here . Democrats get that . \u201d\nRepublican outside groups are trying to pull Saccone across the finish line . Total outside spending in the race currently stands at $ 12.5 million , with the vast majority of that total , more than $ 10.6 million , coming from GOP-aligned groups .\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee has spent $ 3.5 million . Congressional Leadership Fund , the leading GOP super PAC for House races , has spent $ 3.4 million .\nSaccone has needed the help . As of Feb. 21 , Lamb had outspent Saccone by a 5-to-1 margin , $ 3.1 million to $ 615,000 .\nIf Saccone wins on Tuesday , Republicans will take heart that their attack lines \u2014 crime , immigration , linking Democratic candidates to Pelosi \u2014 still work in GOP-leaning districts , though the party has to spend big money to get those messages out there .\nBut if Lamb wins , it will signal to Republicans that the political environment is so hostile that the party can \u2019 t hold a seat Trump won by 20 points , even after spending eight figures .\nNot only is Tuesday 's election for just the remaining nine months of Murphy 's unexpired term , the 18th District wo n't even exist next week , the filing deadline in Pennsylvania for the 2018 midterm elections .\nThe state Supreme Court struck down the existing congressional map earlier this year , ruling that it was so gerrymandered by Republicans that it violated the commonwealth 's constitution .
