But a new Gallup poll suggests that, later in life, it doesn't matter nearly as much as we think. In fact, when you ask college graduates whether they're \"engaged\" with their work or \"thriving\" in all aspects of their lives, their responses don't vary one bit whether they went to a prestigious college or not.\n\nThe surprising findings come in a survey of 29,650 college graduates of all ages by Gallup pollsters working with researchers at Purdue University.
