Sign up here .\nA class-action lawsuit filed in Florida this month seeks to `` make China pay for what they 've done '' in its handling of the coronavirus crisis , saying the country acted `` negligently in their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak . ''\nA personal injury law firm based in Boca Raton , Fla. , is bringing the suit against China and various Chinese government agencies on behalf of `` individuals and business owners in the United States and State of Florida , for damages suffered as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic . ''\nThe suit claims China `` knew that COVID-19 was dangerous and capable of causing a pandemic , yet slowly acted , proverbially put their head in the sand , and/or covered it up in their own economic self-interest . ''\n`` This is an undertaking against a world superpower who has the ability to pay for what they 've done , '' Jeremy Alters , the chief strategist and non-attorney spokesperson for the Berman Law Group , the class-action firm backing the suit , told Fox News .\n`` They have the money to pay for what they 've done , and we should all together make China pay for what they 've done , '' he said .\nWHITE HOUSE , SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $ 2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL , BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN\nThe original complaint has just a handful of named plaintiffs but the lawyers familiar with the case at Berman Law Group say they plan to file an amended complaint at some point with significantly more plaintiffs , including individuals who have gotten sick because of the coronavirus .\nThe lawsuit does not name a specific dollar amount being sought from China , asking for `` compensatory and other damages to Plaintiffs and the Class Members , for their economic and non-economic damages ... to the full extent permitted by the law . '' Alters , however , made clear that though lawyers for Berman would be seeking potentially `` tens of trillions '' from the communist nation , the suit was largely about the symbolism of forcing China to defend its actions in American courts .\n`` We want the court to make them pay for what they 've done , '' Alters said . `` They have unleashed ... a massive pandemic on the world . It appears they knew about it long before they gave information about it to the rest of the world . We want our courts to say , 'China , you are going to be held accountable here in our courts because you have harmed hundreds of millions of Americans . ' ''\nThe suit also has the potential , according to its backers , to bring to light documents and other information about the coronavirus that China may still be withholding from other governments and health experts worldwide .\nThis class-action suit is not the only one filed against China over the coronavirus , but it is the main serious complaint . The D.C.-based far-right organization Freedom Watch filed a $ 20 trillion suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas accusing the Chinese of creating the coronavirus as a bioweapon \u2014 an allegation that has been debunked .\nThe Florida-based suit , however , seeks damages based on the Chinese government 's negligence in containing the coronavirus after it first was transmitted from animals to humans , an allegation with a large amount of supporting evidence .\nTHE CORONAVIRUS DID NOT ESCAPE FROM A LAB : HERE 'S HOW WE KNOW\nThis is made difficult , however , by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act ( FSIA ) which prevents Americans from suing other countries except under specific circumstances . The plaintiffs claim they fit under the exceptions for commercial activity and `` personal injury or death '' that stems from `` the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment . ''\nYale law professor Stephen L. Carter , however , argued in a Bloomberg column Tuesday that the Florida suit 's claims do n't fall under the FSIA exceptions .\n`` The Florida class action suit asserts that the exception for commercial activities applies , but it \u2019 s not easy to see how , '' Carter writes .\nCarter also notes that the second exemption the Florida plaintiffs claim `` specifically bars any claim 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused . ' It \u2019 s hard to find a way around this restriction . ''\nBut Alters says China 's negligence in its response to the coronavirus should fall under the exceptions to FSIA because of how egregious it is .\n`` There is a lengthy history of precedent for bringing foreign nations to our courts for their bad acts that affect Americans , '' he said Tuesday . `` I do n't know in history whether there has been another bad act like this that has affected this many Americans at once , where the entire economy is basically at a standstill and 14 states are now in a stay-at-home order . ''\nThe Florida suit against China also is important , according to its backers , because of the collaboration between two very different firms working the case .\nCORONAVIRUS HITTING NEW YORK LIKE A 'BULLET TRAIN ' AS CASES ARE 'DOUBLING ABOUT EVERY 3 DAYS ' , CUOMO WARNS\nBerman Law Group counts presidential candidate Joe Biden 's brother , Francis , as a senior adviser .
