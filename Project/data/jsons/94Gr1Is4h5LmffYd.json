    "content": "When President Trump Monday nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court , he probably doomed the right to abortion , same-sex marriage , and maybe even contraception .\nKavanaugh , 53 , has spent 12 years as a judge on the D.C . Circuit Court , often thought of as the second most powerful court in the country . Prior to that , Kavanaugh worked for the Office of the Independent Counsel under Ken Starr . There , he headed up the probe into the suicide of longtime Bill Clinton attorney and friend Vince Foster and eventually helped write the Starr Report about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky .\n\u201c Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials , unsurpassed qualifications , and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law , \u201d Trump said during a prime-time address at the White House .\nThat much is true . There is no question that Kavanaugh is highly qualified and widely respected . In addition to serving as a judge , Kavanaugh teaches at both Harvard and Yale law schools . ( Well-known liberal professor at Yale , Akhil Amar , published \u201c A Liberal \u2019 s Case for Brett Kavanaugh \u201d in the New York Times after the announcement . ) His ethical reputation is impeccable .\nBut while Kavanaugh \u2019 s record on women \u2019 s and LGBT rights is sparse , it gives good reason to suspect that he could be the swing vote to strike down Roe v. Wade , the abortion-rights case . This , after all , is what Trump promised in 2016 : that Roe would be \u201c automatically \u201d be overturned should he be elected . And Kavanaugh has been praised by numerous right-wing organizations .\nIn the case of Garza v. Hargan , the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals held that an undocumented teenage immigrant was entitled to obtain an abortion without having to obtain familial consent ( as is required in several states ) .\nKavanaugh vigorously dissented , asking , \u201c Is it really absurd for the United States to think that the minor should be transferred to her immigration sponsor \u2015 ordinarily a family member , relative , or friend \u2015 before she makes that decision ? \u201d\nThose are strong words , endorsing not only parental consent rules but enforcing them in extreme circumstances . If you are looking for signals that a Justice Kavanaugh would limit or overturn Roe , Garza is a giant red flare .\nSurprisingly , however , Kavanaugh may not be conservative enough to survive the confirmation process . There is even talk that conservatives might revolt against Kavanaugh , as they did in 2005 against George W. Bush \u2019 s nomination of Harriet Miers . The reason ? Many conservatives wanted Kavanaugh to cast doubt on the teenager \u2019 s right to get an abortion at all , which another dissenting judge did .\nLegally speaking , that objection is absurd . Not unlike \u201c judicial minimalist \u201d Chief Justice John Roberts , Kavanaugh was discussing the case at issue , not some hypothetical issue . And he was responding to the circuit court \u2019 s holding , not writing an essay .\nBut there \u2019 s more . Some conservatives have pointed to dicta in another Kavanaugh opinion , a dissent in Priests for Life v. HHS , a case similar to Hobby Lobby involving the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s contraception requirement . While dissenting in favor of the Catholic religious organization objecting to the requirement , Kavanaugh wrote that the \u201c the Government has a compelling interest in facilitating women \u2019 s access to contraception \u201d because of a variety of factors , such as \u201c reducing the number of unintended pregnancies would further women \u2019 s health , advance women \u2019 s personal and professional opportunities , reduce the number of abortions , and help break a cycle of poverty . \u201d\nKavanaugh is writing here about the state \u2019 s interest in access to contraception , not whether an individual has a constitutional right to access it . Those are totally different questions . But Kavanaugh \u2019 s opinion doesn \u2019 t question the constitutional right either , which rests on the same foundations ( substantive due process , privacy , family ) as the right to obtain an abortion . It is reasonable to wonder whether Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s dicta in Priests for Life suggests more flexibility on contraception and abortion than hard-right conservatives would like .\nPolitically , however , it might be enough to tar Kavanaugh with the \u201c soft on abortion \u201d label in the right-wing echo chamber , and all it takes is a single Republican senator to doom his nomination , assuming no Democrats cross the aisle . Already , the Democrats \u2019 leader in the Senate , Charles Schumer , said he would oppose Kavanaugh .\nAs for LGBT issues , Kavanaugh \u2019 s record is thin , but enough to worry LGBT activists , who fear he will limit or overturn gay people \u2019 s constitutional right to marriage . In a case anticipating the Supreme Court \u2019 s Hobby Lobby case , Kavanaugh held that the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s requirement that qualified insurance plans include contraception coverage violated the religious freedom of employers .\nThat is the same logic that was at issue in last month \u2019 s Masterpiece Cakeshop case before the Supreme Court , which pitted the rights of LGBT people to be free from discrimination against a bakery owner \u2019 s rights to religious freedom . ( The court ruled in favor of the owner on a technicality . )\nMoreover , despite the misgivings of some conservatives , Kavanaugh was vetted by the Federalist Society and its de facto leader Leonard Leo . It is highly unlikely that the Federalist Society would approve a judicial candidate who didn \u2019 t toe the line on overturning Roe , and Obergefell v. Hodges , the same-sex marriage case .\nWhile the Federalist Society can ask Judge Kavanaugh about his views privately and get a straight answer , it \u2019 s a certainty that when Congress asks , he will chant the mantras of \u201c I will apply the law fairly and respect precedent \u201d and \u201c I can \u2019 t comment on any hypothetical case . \u201d\n\u201c In keeping with President Reagan \u2019 s legacy , I do not ask about a nominee \u2019 s personal opinions , \u201d he said . \u201c What matters is not a judge \u2019 s political views but whether they can set aside those views to do what the law and the constitution require . I am pleased to say that I have found , without doubt , such a person . \u201d\nIn contrast , the Federalist Society \u2019 s Leonard Leo said following the nomination that `` Brett Kavanaugh is among the most distinguished and respected judges in the country , with nearly 300 opinions that clearly demonstrate fairness and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution as it \u2019 s written , and enforcing the limits on government power contained in the Constitution . \u201d\nUnlike what Trump said , Leo \u2019 s statement is a dog-whistle to conservatives . \u201c Interpreting the Constitution as it \u2019 s written \u201d means that substantive due process , the doctrine underneath Roe , Obergefell \u2014and even Griswold v.

That means all those cases are on the chopping block .\nAnd \u201c enforcing the limits on government power \u201d means curbing the power government agencies .
