    "content": "Even Our Revolution , the group started by Sanders in 2016 , lacks access to his new email list that made him the best Democratic fundraiser this year .\nMany of Sanders \u2019 allies were demoralized by what they saw as Our Revolution failing to live up to its potential after his first presidential run . Now , in the wake of a second unsuccessful campaign , some fear they \u2019 re witnessing a repeat of the 2016 wreck unfold in real time .\n\u201c I feel like I \u2019 m in some kind of simulation that \u2019 s having a glitch . All of the same things that happened in 2016 are happening over again , \u201d said a former senior aide to Sanders , who was granted anonymity to speak candidly . \u201c The question is , what do we do now ? ... There 's just nothing comparable on the left to the Bernie campaign . \u201d\nThere is already discord over new organizations that have sprouted since Sanders dropped out last month . Several progressives are incensed over a super PAC that longtime Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver created to help elect presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden , seeing it as a betrayal of the Vermont senator 's opposition to big-money groups .\nOthers worry that Once Again , another PAC started by different top aides to amass more Sanders delegates at the National Democratic Convention , is a waste of time since the primary is all but over .\n\u201c For the top aide to come out of the gate of the campaign and say , I \u2019 m starting a super PAC to persuade Bernie 's grass-roots base to vote for Biden , and Biden has not made any policy promises that would even meet the minimum requirement to earn your adversary \u2019 s voters , that \u2019 s just a slap in the face , \u201d said Winnie Wong , a former senior adviser for Sanders \u2019 campaign . \u201c A lot of Bernie 's very active base are really enraged and pretty horrified . \u201d\nMuch of the tension over the future of Sanders \u2019 army stems from what happened at Our Revolution after his first campaign . When Weaver took it over in 2016 , most of the staff quit in protest , including some who were opposed to his desire to raise large donations through an independent expenditure .\nThen , in the 2018 midterms , Our Revolution flipped zero Republican-held House seats \u2014 a fact that moderates pointed to in the presidential primary to portray Sanders and other left-wing candidates as unelectable .\nSeveral aides and allies believe its problems are partly attributable to the lack of a clear direction . According to three former staffers at Our Revolution , the group undertook a months-long process with aides in 2018 , led by adviser Max Berger , to chart a more distinct path .\nThey settled on an ambitious plan : to try to take over the Democratic Party and transform it into a left-wing social democratic party . But board chairman Larry Cohen opposed the idea \u2014 believing that it was too similar to the goal of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 and it was scrapped .\n\u201c What we saw after \u2019 16 was a real lack of clarity about what work people should actually do , \u201d said Berger , who went on to join Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s presidential campaign .\n\u201c There \u2019 s some anxiety within the progressive movement and Sandersworld that the Sanders Institute and Our Revolution were letdowns after 2016 . '' A former Sanders aide\nCohen dismissed Our Revolution \u2019 s critics , pointing to a 2020 mission plan developed with polling . It lays out three priorities : winning issue fights , building a progressive party and electing more liberals . While the organization didn \u2019 t dispute that the group unseated no Republicans in 2018 , an aide said about one-third of its endorsed candidates won in the midterms .\nAdvisers at Once Again said their group is needed to collect enough delegates required to influence the party platform at the convention . They said it formed in part to keep Sanders voters from growing dispirited over the news of Weaver \u2019 s super PAC .\nWeaver , for his part , argues that an independent expenditure is needed to raise money quickly in the remaining months of the general election . If Biden won and passed into law , say , a $ 15 hourly minimum wage , it would show voters that the progressive movement can deliver , he said .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t ask people decade in and decade out to make small-dollar contributions , knock on doors , make phone calls , and text their friends without demonstrating that the movement can have positive , real results , \u201d Weaver said . \u201c If it \u2019 s just a sort of left debating society , if it \u2019 s just the purity Olympics , we are going to fail miserably . \u201d\nWhile his allies launch and fight over their own PACs , Sanders is still deciding his next steps , according to people close to him .\nFaiz Shakir , Sanders ' 2020 campaign manager , said Sanders wo n't create a new group , while other former aides said that is a possibility .
