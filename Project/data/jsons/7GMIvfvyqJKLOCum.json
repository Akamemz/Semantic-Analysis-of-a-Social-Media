    "content": "With the FBI acknowledging that it is now investigating a possible act of international terrorism on U.S. soil , fresh questions surfaced about whether the Obama administration has been too restrained in combating growing evidence of Islamic extremism at home .\nThe radicalization of the San Bernardino couple who carried out the shooting attack Wednesday before being killed in a police confrontation rekindled long-simmering questions about the administration 's efforts to stem extremism and the tactics it has used to gather information about extremist elements . Its attempts to combat ISIL social media campaigns internationally have been widely criticized as ineffective , while counter extremism efforts in the U.S. have suffered from inadequate funding and inaction during the first years of President Barack Obama 's tenure .\nThe administration 's efforts have created friction within the Muslim community , especially in southern California , which has complained that it has been unfairly targeted in anti-extremism efforts . Some experts have questioned whether the administration 's strategies could ever be effective , since the signs of radicalization are vague and people who change their behavior abruptly often turn out to pose no threat .\nThe issues surfaced again as the FBI confirmed that the couple responsible for the San Bernardino massacre -- Syed Rizwan Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik -- had some contact with individuals who had been the subject of prior FBI investigations . That prompted questions about the thoroughness of those inquiries , while reports that Malik paid tribute to an ISIS leader on social media as the attack unfolded led to questions about whether more aggressive Internet monitoring might have exposed the couple 's plans in time for authorities to thwart them .\nFBI Director James Comey insisted that none of the developments established that the FBI had dropped the ball .\n`` Folks have focused on reports ... that at least one of the killers was in contact with people who have been the subject of FBI investigations , '' Comey told reporters as he opened a briefing at FBI headquarters in Washington . `` I would urge you not to make too much of that . There were no contacts between either of these killers and subjects of our investigations that were of such significance that it raised these killers up onto our radar screen ..... I would not want you to over-index on that just yet . ''\nComey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the answer to averting such attacks lay primarily in greater vigilance by the public . The FBI director said that in nearly all cases involving planned acts of terror , people had concerns trouble was brewing but did not report those suspicions .\nHowever , the viability of that approach in southern California 's Muslim community at the moment is unclear -- in large part due to a debate about the FBI 's tactics in investigating Muslims that has been raging in that region for nearly a decade . A former FBI informant 's revelations in 2009 that he was asked by the agency to infiltrate at least ten mosques in Orange County and Los Angeles between 2006 and 2007 spread like wildfire through the Muslim community , members say .\nLawsuits related to the saga have played out in the courts ever since , with one of the main challenges to the FBI tactics scheduled to be argued in front of a federal appeals court in Pasadena , Calif. Monday morning . The episode soured many area Muslims on cooperation with the FBI . When the Obama Administration chose Los Angeles last year as one of three cities to pilot a new effort at `` Countering Violent Extremism , '' most major Muslim groups in the area boycotted .\n`` The incident here in Irvine is something that is definitely fresh in people 's memories and it severely , severely damaged trust between the FBI and the local Muslim community , '' said Haroon Manjlai , of the Council on American-Islamic Relations .\nAn attorney for family members of the couple responsible for the San Bernardino attacks appeared to allude to the informant tactic Friday during a press conference as he discussed the appearance of one FBI agent who interviewed the family members for hours . `` One of the FBI investigators we sat down with looked like he would be a plant in a mosque . He had a beard . He just looked like he walked out of Pakistan or Saudi Arabia , '' lawyer David Chelsey said .\nManjlai said the informant used in Orange County and L.A. several years ago , Craig Monteilh , was quickly singled out by mosque-goers for strange behavior . `` We reported him to the [ authorities ] right away .... This office reported him to the FBI , '' said Manjlai . In fact , Monteilh 's actions and statements were so provocative that mosque leaders went to state court to get a restraining order against him .\nIn court papers , officials have claimed there was a lawful basis for that investigation , but the Justice Department never revealed that in court . Instead , it invoked the state secrets privilege to defeat the suit , even though President Barack Obama vowed to cut back on the use of that tactic . A judge granted the motion , saying that the individuals ' desire for justice and for information about why they were wrapped up in the investigation had to take a back seat to national security concerns .\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union attorney Peter Bibring said there are many indications that the investigation was not appropriately targeted . `` That informant has very publicly stated to a number of press outlets he was told to collect as much information as he could at mosques ... to collect names , emails , addresses and phone numbers .... He collected information on thousands of people , '' Bibring said in an interview . `` He was told to pay special attention to people that seemed devout . ''\nThe issue of whether mosques should be watched more closely by law enforcement has already arisen on the presidential campaign trail . After the attacks in Paris last month , Republican candidate Donald Trump said some Muslim places of worship should be watched more closely .\n\u201c I want surveillance of certain mosques , OK ? ... We \u2019 ve had it before and we \u2019 ll have it again , '' Trump said , apparently alluding to a New York Police Department program that gathered information on mosques as well as Muslim-owned businesses in the years following the September 11 attacks .\nSome GOP candidates also have questioned the Obama Administration and other candidates over a law the White House backed to dismantle a bulk-collection program for U.S. phone data aimed at tracing connections between terror suspects and to move to a new system where the data stays with phone companies . Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida invoked the San Bernardino attack as he swung on that issue again Friday , but he directed his criticism at fellow candidate Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for voting for the change .\nOne former FBI official said controversy over FBI tactics and pressure from the Obama administration not to anger the Muslim community has led the FBI to be more circumspect about going into mosques .\n`` There is pressure to avoid that , '' said former FBI Associate Deputy Director Buck Revell . `` What 's different now is the top down push from the top of the administration that they do n't want to acknowledge any type of connection with Islamists and political Islam and their activities supporting jihadism in the U.S .... That puts tremendous pressure on FBI agents . Coming out of the recent attack you have a push back by the media and Congress that the FBI should be doing more and why were n't you there . It 's kind of a Catch-22 . ''\nRevell noted that there are FBI manuals and Attorney General guidelines that grew out of surveillance of political groups in the 1960s and of church groups in the 1980s that make it harder for FBI agents to use undercover tactics in a place of worship like a mosque than in a business or even a private home . He said those guidelines should be reviewed but not abandoned .\n`` I think an examination of that guidance and particularly the administration 's policy going forward is appropriate and necessary , '' Revell said , noting similar discussions after the Fort Hood attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing . `` But I do n't think no guidelines is the appropriate answer . That would be even worse .... Are you going to argue that every young Muslim who grows a beard and goes to a mosque is a logical target ? ''\nLynch struck an empathetic tone towards Muslim Americans in recent days , noting the need to engage the Muslim community in the terrorism fight and also to protect them from retaliation in the wake of the recent attacks in Paris and California .\n`` Obviously , we want to protect civil liberties and privacy , '' she said . `` Some of our greatest partners in these investigations in these matters are members of the Muslim community who will observe people at a very close level and will have concerns . Do n't have a fear that by raising an issue you are going to have some sort of public disclosure of your friend , your neighbor 's problems .... Frankly , the Muslim community is at much at risk as any other community . ''\nIn what may have been a response to the lack of trust in some quarters , both Lynch and Comey stressed Friday that FBI investigations are low-key in most instances and people reporting suspicious activity do n't need to be concerned that a tip will mean an acquaintance is unfairly tarred with terrorism accusations .\n`` We will investigate it quickly and responsibly . We investigate in secret so that we do n't smear innocent people . We do n't run over and bang on your neighbor 's door if you say something . We investigate . If there was nothing there , no harm done . If there was something there , great harm may be avoided , '' Comey said . `` We do it secretly because there may be nothing to it . They may have just had a bad , bad day . ''\nComey did not address tactics such as undercover investigations of mosques Friday , but he did suggest that more intrusive online surveillance by government was misguided .\nAfter the FBI Director repeatedly called on the public to report suspicious social media activity , he was asked why the FBI was n't examining social media postings more closely on its own .\n`` Because we do n't live in that kind of country , '' Comey replied . `` The FBI does not , can not , should not monitor all the communications of Americans . Our investigations are predicated , which means we do n't look at someone unless we have a basis to believe that they 're engaged in criminal activity or terrorism . The predication is often someone who 's in a forum in a meeting or in an educational institution [ who sees someone ] who 's acting in a way that 's either weird or ... is a change , and they tell us . ''\nAsked Friday if Farook or Malik would have or should have encountered any of the counter-violent extremism efforts the U.S. government has undertaken , Comey demurred . `` I do n't want to talk about these killers in particular . It 's hard to say in the abstract . I do n't know . I have to give more thought to that . ''\nThe FBI director said , however , that it is difficult to target those efforts since the people involved in plotting attacks like the one in California or in planning travel to fight for ISIL do n't fit a clear profile .\n`` I will say the challenge of our efforts to try and find and redirect people is that it is a wide spectrum of folks , '' he said . `` It is n't a particular demographic or geography . it 's about people seeking meaning in their lives in a misguided way . So , we find particularly ISIL 's message resonating with kids , we 're trying to figure out who they are , and people in their 20s -- a lot of them in their 20s , who are struggling in life ..... It 's very hard to nail down . That 's why we do this work in all 50 states . ''\nThe FBI and Justice Department officials say despite challenges on the messaging and community outreach fronts , they have aggressively pursued and thwarted people intent on committing attacks or traveling to Syria to fight on behalf of ISIL .\nIn the past six months , more than 15 people have been charged for plotting attacks in the U.S. and more than 60 in connection with efforts to travel to the region and fight , a Justice Department official said Friday .\nWhatever changes may be made to the FBI 's tactics or the government 's broader anti-radicalization efforts , Revell said people need to come to terms with the fact that the system is not going to be foolproof .\n`` If you 're going to live in a society that is not a totalitarian society , there will be instances in which they fly under the radar , under the scope , '' he said .",
