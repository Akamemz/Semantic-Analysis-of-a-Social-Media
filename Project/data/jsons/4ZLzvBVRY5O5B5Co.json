What she wrote does not devalue the work of Nicholas Kristof or Bret Stephens or other writers who remain on those pages . But , combined with the absurd hysteria surrounding the op-ed last month by Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-Ark . ) , the paper \u2019 s crisis \u2014 and its shrinking bubble \u2014 is fully revealed . The limited worldview that Weiss described inside the newspaper will asphyxiate everyone left behind and poison those for whom it is their only source of intellectual nourishment .\nI see it as relentless as the bubble that always \u2014 always \u2014 captured actor Patrick McGoohan in the late \u2018 60s British TV show \u201c The Prisoner. \u201d He could never escape it . Its real-world counterpart is the confirmation bias consuming the New York Times \u2019 Opinion pages .\nThe closing of the American left \u2019 s mind has advanced far beyond the condition Allan Bloom described in \u201c The Closing of the American Mind , \u201d his 1987 book about the rise of moral relativism on U.S. colleges and universities . That is true on the right as well . Intellectual curiosity about worlds , and worldviews , other than our own is at a low ebb .\nSo seek out the bubble-breakers . Are you a President Trump supporter who wants to run into an argument you can not dismiss or treat with reflexive contempt ?

It expanded my bubble . It helps , of course , that Glaude is an elegant writer and superb scholar , but the power of the book is in its ability to teach a willing reader about the experience of black America in the years since Baldwin began writing in the late 1940s .
