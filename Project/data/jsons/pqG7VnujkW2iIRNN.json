    "content": "The greatest political spy drama of the age has been playing out daily for 12 months , with the former FBI chief Robert Mueller at its centre and an audience of millions around the world playing amateur detective .\nMueller , appointed special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election , has spent the last year diligently pursuing a complex web of money and influence \u2013 or , as Trump would have it , engaging in a \u201c $ 10,000,000 witch-hunt \u201d .\nDid Donald Trump win the White House aided by Russia \u2019 s hidden hand ? What does the steely special counsel know ? And as his inquiry into alleged collusion enters its second year today , when will he deliver ?\nMueller \u2019 s investigation has already yielded charges against four Trump associates and , while he has not spoken publicly , the charges testify to the scope of the investigation .\nSo far Mueller has brought charges or reached plea agreements against 19 people and three Russian entities . Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser Michael Flynn , campaign aide Rick Gates and former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos have entered plea deals . Ex-election campaign chairman Paul Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering , tax fraud , failure to register as a foreign agent and other charges .\nAs the investigation encircles Trump , some of his family , his closest friends and White House officials have been questioned by Mueller \u2019 s team .\nMeanwhile , as the inquiry has expanded and dominated the news agenda over the last year , the real issues of people \u2019 s lives are in danger of being drowned out by obsessive cable television coverage of the Russia investigation .\nFrom leading columnists to frontline politicians , people are grappling with how to create space to talk about something other than Mueller .\nKyle Pope , editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review , said while print and digital news media have mostly done a good job of lifting their gaze , cable news has struggled to escape a constant daily focus on Mueller and the Trump scandal .\n\u201c The Mueller investigation really boils down the partisan approach of cable news , \u201d he said , with MSNBC on the left and conservative Fox News on the right .\n\u201c My own reading is that both sides are losing credibility \u2013 you can only tell me so many times that this is the beginning of the end and it not happen for me to start turning it off .
