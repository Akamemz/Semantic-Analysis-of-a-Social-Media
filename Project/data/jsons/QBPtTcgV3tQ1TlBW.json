These bills include measures authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers ; the Hire More Heroes Act , legislation encouraging employers to hire more of our nation \u2019 s veterans ; and a proposal to restore the traditional 40-hour definition of full-time employment , removing an arbitrary and destructive government barrier to more hours and better pay created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 . \u201d\nChanging of the guard - WaPotakes a look at who could potentially head key committees in the upcoming Republican controlled Senate , including Sens . John McCain R-Ariz. , at Armed Services , Sen.

The attorneys made the assertions in a court filing last month as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over the missing emails that was filed by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch . The IRS has said that potentially thousands of emails belonging to Lerner , a central figure in the agency \u2019 s targeting of conservative groups , were lost in a hard drive crash in 2011 . \u201d\n\u201c Oh , you can bet on that. \u201d \u2014 Sen.

But if somehow he facilitates the killing of more babies in their mothers \u2019 wombs or the suppression of more political speech from his critics , what will a Republican Congress do ? What is its track record ? \u201d ]\nAlaska Dispatch News : \u201c Numbers released by Alaska elections officials Wednesday morning showed [ Sen. Mark Begich , D-Alaska ] facing daunting odds : He needs to win a substantial majority of as many as 50,000 uncounted absentee and other outstanding ballots to catch up with [ Republican Dan Sullivan ] \u2026 With 100 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday , Sullivan led Begich by about 8,000 votes . State elections officials said there were nearly 24,000 uncounted absentee and early votes , which won \u2019 t be tallied until next week . \u2026 In 2008 , when Begich beat Republican Sen. Ted Stevens -- who was more popular than Sullivan in rural Alaska -- Begich trailed by 3,000 votes on election night , and he ended up winning by 4,000 votes , swinging the results about 2.7 percent . But that year , more than 100,000 votes were counted in the weeks after the election , and this year , there appears to be only about half that total outstanding , with Begich trailing by 3.6 percent . \u201d\nGILLESPIE MULLS OPTONS AS FINAL COUNT FIRMS UP FOR WARNER\nWaPo : \u201c With all but one precinct reporting , [ Sen. Mark Warner \u2019 s , D-Va. ] , margin of victory settled at nearly 17,000 votes out of more than 2 million cast in his race for a second term against [ Republican Ed Gillespie ] , according to results compiled by the Associated Press . Warner held 49.2 percent of the vote , just slightly ahead of Gillespie \u2019 s 48.4 percent . \u2026 Gillespie may ask for a recount once the votes are certified by state election officials , a process that election officials expect to complete Nov. 24\u2026 In Virginia , the loser can ask for a recount if the margin is less than 1 percent of the total number of votes cast \u2014 which it is , so far , in the Senate race . But the state would pay for the recount only if the margin falls below one-half of 1 percent of the votes cast \u2014 a threshold that the current results do not meet . \u201d\nWSJ : \u201c Democrat Daniel Malloy won a second term as Connecticut governor , edging Republican businessman Tom Foley in a rematch of their closely-fought battle four years ago .

Mary Landrieu ( D-La . ) didn \u2019 t lose her reelection race [ Tuesday ] , but she did lose her powers as chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee , leaving her with little leverage going into a December runoff .

But Israel wo n't be preparing the DCCC for that . He said Wednesday he turned down a request by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to return as chairman for a third election . Instead , he said he is talking with her about staying in House Democratic leadership . \u201d\nThe Hill : \u201c Sen . Dean Heller ( R-Nev. ) wants to become chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) , a source close to the senator confirms to The Hill . Heller , a swing-state freshman , plans to make the push to replace NRSC Chairman Jerry Moran ( R-Kan. ) , who \u2019 s not expected to seek another term . The next NRSC chairman will face a challenging map , with many more Republicans from Democratic-leaning and swing states up for reelection than red-state Democrats . \u201d\nHow will the various parts of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign dreadnaught know when to start really revving up ? Watch John Podesta to find out . BuzzFeed : \u201c One way to tell what Clinton is doing : Watch John Podesta . Most people watching the Clinton orbit agree that he will be key to a campaign . Last year , Podesta was in talks to co-chair Priorities USA Action , the pro-Obama super PAC that has realigned itself behind a potential Clinton candidacy . But that fell through when he agreed to join the White House senior staff as a counselor . Podesta has said he agreed to serve in that role for a full year . He hits the one-year mark on Jan. 1 , 2015 . One former campaign aide suggested Clinton wouldn \u2019 t announce her campaign until he could leave the White House and assume his expected role as chair . \u201d\n[ The roster : Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee head Guy Cecil , Democratic strategist and opposition research maven Ace Smith , and the head of the head of pro-choice group EMILY \u2019 s list Stephanie Schriock are all in the list of senior campaign leaders , but the odds-on favorite for managing what will be the biggest , most-expensive and longest presidential campaign ever is Robby Mook , who ran the successful campaign of long-time Clintonite , Gov . Terry McAuliffe , D-Va . ]\nHillary shadow groups set to huddle - USA Today : \u201c Democratic strategists and donors Wednesday sought to quickly pivot away from their coast-to-coast midterm defeats , and prepare for the 2016 political battleground that includes the high-stakes presidential fight and more than two-dozen Senate races . Groups backing [ Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton ] , for instance , plan major gatherings with donors in the weeks ahead . On Nov. 20 , a super PAC called Correct the Record will hold a lunch with current and prospective donors in New York City . A day later , top donors to another pro-Clinton group , Ready for Hillary , will meet for a strategy session . \u201d\nRyan : midterm results mean Hillary isn \u2019 t inevitable - Potential 2016 Republican contender Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , is using the midterm results to suggest the GOP could topple Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton . \u201c It just tells you that she \u2019 s not inevitable , \u201d Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt . \u201c I think she \u2019 s very beatable . I really do . \u201d\nWhat about Warren ? - Fox News : \u201c Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was among the more successful Democrats stumping for their party ahead of Tuesday \u2019 s midterm elections . Of the 11 candidates Warren campaigned or fundraised for , six won . \u201d\nSun News Network : \u201c There may be a lot of things wrong with the U.S. Congress , but Wayne Gretzky \u2019 s height isn \u2019 t one of them . While most people on Capitol Hill were busy dealing with the fallout of Tuesday \u2019 s mid-term elections , one hockey fan just couldn \u2019 t stand by and let Gretzky \u2019 s Wikipedia bio contain incorrect information . The Great One \u2019 s page listed him as being 5-foot-8 . But on Wednesday someone changed that to six feet . The change was noticed by a Twitter \u2018 bot \u2019 called @ CongressEdits , which tracks edits that come from congressional IP addresses . The IP addresses are anonymous , so the identity of the Gretzky Good Samaritan is not known . The user \u2019 s information jibes with NHL.com , which has the Brantford , Ont.-born star as six feet tall . \u201d\n\u201c Of course it was about [ President Obama ] , of course it was his ideology and the execution of his leadership . This was a wall to wall rejection of Obamaism and he pretended today as if it was an election that doesn \u2019 t have a lot of meaning , because two thirds of the electorate didn \u2019 t show up. \u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer , on \u201c Special Report with Bret Baier. \u201d Watch here .\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News .

Repeal of the law I won\u2019t sign.\u201d \u2013President Obama during a press conference Wednesday.]\n\n\n\nMcConnell, Boehner lay out agenda - From a WSJ op-ed from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner: \u201cThese bills provide an obvious and potentially bipartisan starting point for the new Congress\u2014and, for President Obama, a chance to begin the final years of his presidency by taking some steps toward a stronger economy. These bills include measures authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers; the Hire More Heroes Act, legislation encouraging employers to hire more of our nation\u2019s veterans; and a proposal to restore the traditional 40-hour definition of full-time employment, removing an arbitrary and destructive government barrier to more hours and better pay created by the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging of the guard - WaPotakes a look at who could potentially head key committees in the upcoming Republican controlled Senate, including Sens. John McCain R-Ariz., at Armed Services, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., at Homeland Security, Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., at the helm of the Senate Budget Committee, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, at Finance, and James Inhofe, R-Okla., at Environment and Public Works which oversees the administration\u2019s energy regulations. Among GOP women, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, will likely take the reins of the Senate Energy Committee.\n\n\n\nIRS hearings are on the docket - Fox News: \u201cAttorneys for the IRS have told a federal court that they have not searched various \u201cother sources\u201d for the missing emails of former agency official Lois Lerner, claiming that doing so would be fruitless. The attorneys made the assertions in a court filing last month as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit over the missing emails that was filed by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. The IRS has said that potentially thousands of emails belonging to Lerner, a central figure in the agency\u2019s targeting of conservative groups, were lost in a hard drive crash in 2011.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, you can bet on that.\u201d\u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked at a press conference if the Senate would hold hearings looking into the IRS scandal.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep.

Today, the American Enterprise Institute is hosting a forum on how to find common ground in the next Congress on education. Click here to attend or watch online.\n\n\n\n[The Judge\u2019s ruling - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano considers how the culture wars could impinge on Republican plans in Congress: \u201cA lame duck President Obama facing a Congress he hates and fears may become reckless. We should expect that. But if somehow he facilitates the killing of more babies in their mothers\u2019 wombs or the suppression of more political speech from his critics, what will a Republican Congress do? What is its track record?\u201d]\n\n\n\nODDS AGAINST BEGICH\n\nAlaska Dispatch News: \u201cNumbers released by Alaska elections officials Wednesday morning showed [Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska] facing daunting odds: He needs to win a substantial majority of as many as 50,000 uncounted absentee and other outstanding ballots to catch up with [Republican Dan Sullivan]\u2026 With 100 percent of precincts reporting early Wednesday, Sullivan led Begich by about 8,000 votes. State elections officials said there were nearly 24,000 uncounted absentee and early votes, which won\u2019t be tallied until next week. \u2026 In 2008, when Begich beat Republican Sen. Ted Stevens -- who was more popular than Sullivan in rural Alaska -- Begich trailed by 3,000 votes on election night, and he ended up winning by 4,000 votes, swinging the results about 2.7 percent. But that year, more than 100,000 votes were counted in the weeks after the election, and this year, there appears to be only about half that total outstanding, with Begich trailing by 3.6 percent.\u201d\n\n\n\nGILLESPIE MULLS OPTONS AS FINAL COUNT FIRMS UP FOR WARNER\n\nWaPo: \u201cWith all but one precinct reporting, [Sen. Mark Warner\u2019s, D-Va.], margin of victory settled at nearly 17,000 votes out of more than 2 million cast in his race for a second term against [Republican Ed Gillespie], according to results compiled by the Associated Press. Warner held 49.2 percent of the vote, just slightly ahead of Gillespie\u2019s 48.4 percent. \u2026 Gillespie may ask for a recount once the votes are certified by state election officials, a process that election officials expect to complete Nov. 24\u2026 In Virginia, the loser can ask for a recount if the margin is less than 1 percent of the total number of votes cast \u2014 which it is, so far, in the Senate race. But the state would pay for the recount only if the margin falls below one-half of 1 percent of the votes cast \u2014 a threshold that the current results do not meet.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Ed. Note: Since Virginia is still technically undeclared, I won\u2019t declare victory in my bet on the outcome with Dana Perino. And though I\u2019m not worried about having to start finding a silkscreen shop to make my \u201cJasper for President\u201d shirt, Dana deserves lavish praise for seeing potential in Gillespie\u2019s race when I saw none. I thought she was just following her heart, but I should have known better than to dismiss any insight from one of the sharpest minds I know.]\n\n\n\nMALLOY MAKES IT BY A NOSE\n\nWSJ: \u201cDemocrat Daniel Malloy won a second term as Connecticut governor, edging Republican businessman Tom Foley in a rematch of their closely-fought battle four years ago. The Associated Press declared Mr. Malloy the victor Wednesday afternoon. With 99% of precincts reporting by 3:15 p.m., Mr. Malloy was leading Mr. Foley 50.8% to 48.2% according to the Associated Press.\u201d\n\n\n\nLANDRIEU DEFENSELESS WITHOUT GAVEL\n\nThe Hill: \u201cSen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) didn\u2019t lose her reelection race [Tuesday], but she did lose her powers as chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, leaving her with little leverage going into a December runoff. Landrieu will square off against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) in [a Dec.6] runoff, but now she can\u2019t wave her committee gavel as a symbol of the influence she wields in Washington, D.C. and offer its benefits to Louisiana voters\u2026 heading into a runoff makes the race an entirely different story, as Democrats have long admitted their best bet at a win in Louisiana was on Election Day. \u2018The narrative has certainly changed,\u2019 J. Bennett Johnston Jr., a former Louisiana Democratic senator who held the same chairmanship when he was in office, said.\u201d\n\n\n\nISRAEL OUT AT DCCC\n\nNewsday: \u201cSleep-deprived and smarting from what he called \u2018an ugly night for Democrats at all levels,\u2019 [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel] said one lesson from the midterms that\u2019s essential in 2016 is identifying and contacting voters, early and often. But Israel won't be preparing the DCCC for that. He said Wednesday he turned down a request by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to return as chairman for a third election. Instead, he said he is talking with her about staying in House Democratic leadership.\u201d\n\n\n\nHELLER-ACIOUS GIG: NEVADA SEN. WANTS NRSC\n\nThe Hill: \u201cSen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) wants to become chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), a source close to the senator confirms to The Hill. Heller, a swing-state freshman, plans to make the push to replace NRSC Chairman Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), who\u2019s not expected to seek another term. The next NRSC chairman will face a challenging map, with many more Republicans from Democratic-leaning and swing states up for reelection than red-state Democrats.\u201d\n\n\n\nPODESTA DEPARTURE WILL CUE CLINTON CAMPAIGN\n\nHow will the various parts of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign dreadnaught know when to start really revving up? Watch John Podesta to find out. BuzzFeed: \u201cOne way to tell what Clinton is doing: Watch John Podesta. Most people watching the Clinton orbit agree that he will be key to a campaign. Last year, Podesta was in talks to co-chair Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC that has realigned itself behind a potential Clinton candidacy. But that fell through when he agreed to join the White House senior staff as a counselor. Podesta has said he agreed to serve in that role for a full year. He hits the one-year mark on Jan. 1, 2015. One former campaign aide suggested Clinton wouldn\u2019t announce her campaign until he could leave the White House and assume his expected role as chair.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The roster: Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee head Guy Cecil, Democratic strategist and opposition research maven Ace Smith, and the head of the head of pro-choice group EMILY\u2019s list Stephanie Schriock are all in the list of senior campaign leaders, but the odds-on favorite for managing what will be the biggest, most-expensive and longest presidential campaign ever is Robby Mook, who ran the successful campaign of long-time Clintonite, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va.]\n\n\n\nHillary shadow groups set to huddle - USA Today: \u201cDemocratic strategists and donors Wednesday sought to quickly pivot away from their coast-to-coast midterm defeats, and prepare for the 2016 political battleground that includes the high-stakes presidential fight and more than two-dozen Senate races. Groups backing [Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton], for instance, plan major gatherings with donors in the weeks ahead. On Nov. 20, a super PAC called Correct the Record will hold a lunch with current and prospective donors in New York City. A day later, top donors to another pro-Clinton group, Ready for Hillary, will meet for a strategy session.\u201d\n\n\n\nRyan: midterm results mean Hillary isn\u2019t inevitable - Potential 2016 Republican contender Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is using the midterm results to suggest the GOP could topple Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt just tells you that she\u2019s not inevitable,\u201d Ryan told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cI think she\u2019s very beatable. I really do.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat about Warren? - Fox News: \u201cMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was among the more successful Democrats stumping for their party ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. Of the 11 candidates Warren campaigned or fundraised for, six won.\u201d\n\n\n\nCONGRESS: DEFEATING HOSERS, ONE WIKIPEDIA POST AT A TIME\n\nSun News Network: \u201cThere may be a lot of things wrong with the U.S. Congress, but Wayne Gretzky\u2019s height isn\u2019t one of them. While most people on Capitol Hill were busy dealing with the fallout of Tuesday\u2019s mid-term elections, one hockey fan just couldn\u2019t stand by and let Gretzky\u2019s Wikipedia bio contain incorrect information. The Great One\u2019s page listed him as being 5-foot-8. But on Wednesday someone changed that to six feet. The change was noticed by a Twitter \u2018bot\u2019 called @CongressEdits, which tracks edits that come from congressional IP addresses. The IP addresses are anonymous, so the identity of the Gretzky Good Samaritan is not known. The user\u2019s information jibes with NHL.com, which has the Brantford, Ont.-born star as six feet tall.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cOf course it was about [President Obama], of course it was his ideology and the execution of his leadership. This was a wall to wall rejection of Obamaism and he pretended today as if it was an election that doesn\u2019t have a lot of meaning, because two thirds of the electorate didn\u2019t show up.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer, on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
