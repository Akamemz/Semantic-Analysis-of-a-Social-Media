( Leah Millis/Reuters )\nIn an essay for Politico , David S. Glosser launches into a sharp-tongued critique of the immigration views of Stephen Miller , who is both his nephew and a top Trump aide . With a headline calling Miller a \u201c hypocrite \u201d on immigration , Glosser \u2019 s essay tells the rags-to-riches story of Miller \u2019 s own ancestors , who arrived in the U.S. as poor Jewish immigrants but ended up owning a number of supermarkets and department stores .

It \u2019 s been trotted out against Miller , President Trump , and others . So perhaps it \u2019 s worth spending a few minutes looking at the limits of the \u201c hypocrisy \u201d charge .\nFirst of all , the current immigration system would also have excluded the ancestors of many Americans . Family preferences constitute the bulk of new immigrants to the United States ; these preferences would have excluded past immigrants who had no family connections in the United States when they first immigrated .

Skills-based migration would exclude many would-be immigrants , but so does our current immigration system .\nThe \u201c hypocrisy \u201d argument falls short on other grounds , too . Saying that you can \u2019 t support changing a policy that benefited your ancestors ( or even you ) would create a bizarre paralysis in political debates .
