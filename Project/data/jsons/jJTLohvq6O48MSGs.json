Bloomberg of New York will be in Washington next Friday , along with members of the United States Chamber of Commerce and several prominent Republicans , to pressure Republican lawmakers to take up an overhaul of the nation \u2019 s immigration laws before the end of the current Congress .\nThe immigration summit , which will be Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s first major public policy event since stepping down as mayor , is pegged to President Obama \u2019 s coming State of the Union address , in which he is likely to address problems with the country \u2019 s immigration system . The event \u2019 s organizers also hope to capitalize on momentum in the Republican-controlled House , where Speaker John A. Boehner and his leadership team are preparing to release a policy blueprint that is likely to include at least some path to legal status for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country .\nOther participants include Carlos Gutierrez , who was secretary of commerce under President George W. Bush and a founder of Republicans for Immigration Reform , a \u201c super PAC \u201d ; Gov . Rick Snyder , Republican of Michigan ; and Randy Johnson , senior vice president at the Chamber of Commerce .\nThe leaders plan to focus on the economic case for immigration reform , which they hope will be a compelling argument for Republican lawmakers \u2014 many of whom consider any overhaul that includes a path to legal status to be amnesty \u2014 to take home to their districts .\n\u201c If there was ever a notion that immigration reform was a progressive cause , that notion is clearly no longer true , because you see Republicans of all stripes understanding that immigration reform is essential to the country \u2019 s prosperity , to economic prosperity and certainly to the political prosperity of any national party , \u201d said John Feinblatt , the chairman of the Partnership for a New American Economy , the immigration group that was founded by Mr. Bloomberg .\nHe added that Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s willingness to use his first postmayoral trip to Washington to push for an immigration overhaul \u201c is a clear signal of his passion for the issue and his intention to accelerate his support . \u201d\n\u201c Our nation must do a better job of extending opportunity to all , and immigration reform is essential to that effort , \u201d said Thomas J. Donohue , president and chief executive of the Chamber . \u201c It will add jobs , talent , innovation , investment and dynamism to our economy . We need to enact legislation that transforms our broken immigration system into one that drives stronger job creation and economic growth . \u201d\nAt his annual State of American Business address this month , Mr. Donohue said changes to the nation \u2019 s immigration laws were an important part of expanding jobs and careers that will exist in the 21st century . \u201c Why ? Because throughout history immigrants have brought innovation , ideas and investments to American enterprise , and in terms of demographics , we need immigration , \u201d he said .\nAn overhaul of the nation \u2019 s immigration laws passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June but stalled in the House , where many Republicans fear a primary fight from their more conservative base .\nBut an increasing number of prominent Republicans are coming forward to push for a bipartisan and comprehensive approach to the nation \u2019 s immigration laws .
