The top dispute in the seven-candidate field centered on remarks by the perceived front-runner , former Dollar General CEO David Perdue , during an editorial board meeting with The Telegraph newspaper in Macon , Ga. During the meeting , Perdue was asked about the nation 's debt and whether it would be best to curb the growth of spending or increase revenue . Perdue interjected , saying \u2018 both , \u2019 and the questioner added the latter would be \u2018 a euphemism for some kind of tax increase , of course. \u2019 Perdue laughed and referenced his business experience\u2026Rep . Paul Broun [ R-Ga. ] condemned Perdue 's \u2018 arrogance \u2019 in thinking so many senators would n't understand what he was saying . Rep. Jack Kingston [ R-Ga. ] , who has led in fundraising and has the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said Perdue 's tax increases would \u2018 only hurt our economy. \u2019 But Karen Handel struck perhaps the harshest tone , saying Perdue 's remarks \u2018 should raise a question in everyone 's mind. \u2019 \u2018 Exactly who is this guy ? He 's not a conservative and I question whether he 's even a Republican , \u2019 she said . Perdue 's campaign called the attacks \u2018 deceitful \u2019 and said Perdue was talking about increasing revenues by cutting spending and promoting pro-growth policies . \u2018 He never said the phrase \u2018 tax increase , \u2019 \u2019 \u2019 said campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey . \u2018 David believes that tax increases hinder economic growth and destroy jobs . \u2019 \u2019 \u2019\nThe Hill : \u201c Businessman Mark Jacobs 's ( R ) campaign is going after Iowa state Sen.

Scott Walker in Wisconsin, but potentially riskier since Pence\u2019s plan sounds more ambitious.\n\nThe details - AP: \u201cLow-income Indiana residents would have more health-insurance options, including some with no cost, under [the] two-tiered plan\u2026Pence\u2019s proposal appears to be an attempt to address some of the federal government\u2019s concerns about HIP, including a requirement that recipients under the poverty line contribute the first $1,100 of their care\u2026.Those briefed on Pence\u2019s proposal say participation could rise as high as 500,000 people if the federal government approves the plan.\u201d\n\n[Attn: Jim Angle - Indianapolis Business Journal: \u201c\u2018Pence\u2019s plan involves a combination of the Healthy Indiana Plan, employer-sponsored health plans and health savings accounts\u2019\u2026[according to an invitation to today\u2019s Indianapolis rollout] Pence \u2018plans to use private market-based reforms, employer-based plans, and HSAs to transform health care in a fiscally responsible manner for the Medicaid-eligible population in Indiana.\u2019\u201d]\n\nYOU COULD ALMOST CALL IT WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE\u2026\n\n\u201cIf I decide to do something more, it's going to be how the people in the country feel about me.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on his recent climate change comments. NextGen Climate, which Steyer founded in 2013, released a Web video on Wednesday chiding Rubio for getting caught \u2018on the wrong side of the numbers\u2019\u2026 The video challenges all potential 2016 presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.), Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Gov. Bobby Jindal (R-La.) and others to answer where they stand on climate change. \u2018If you are thinking about running for president, answer this: Do you stand with the facts, or do you stand with Sen. Rubio? The pressure's on,\u2019 the video states, ending with footage of Rubio's infamous GOP rebuttal to President Obama's 2013 State of the Union address where he awkwardly reaches for a drink of water.\u201d\n\nCRUZ DEPLOYS DAD TO COURT IOWA CONSERVATIVES\n\nDes Moines Register: \u201cU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's [R-Texas] father \u2013 and maybe the senator himself \u2013 will return to Iowa this summer for a summit of politically active social conservatives. The third annual Family Leadership Summit will be held Aug. 9 at Stephens Auditorium in Ames, the Family Leader advocacy group announced Wednesday. While Pastor Rafael Cruz and evangelical Christian novelist Joel Rosenberg are confirmed speakers, a long list of potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates have also been invited, including Ted Cruz, Texas [Republican] Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas [Republican] Gov. Mike Huckabee and Louisiana [Republican] Gov. Bobby Jindal. The Family Leader has asked conservative political celebrities Ben Carson, Star Parker and [Former Gov.

Terry Branstad has a whopping $4.5 million cash-on-hand, the largest amount ever for an Iowa gubernatorial race. Branstad\u2019s campaign says more than 15,000 total donors contributed this reporting period, 98 percent of them from Iowa.

Tom Udall, have talked about passing a constitutional amendment to re-impose campaign finance restrictions, Reid had not been one of them \u2014 until now\u2026 Reid also rejected concerns from many Democrats that his focus on the Kochs has done nothing to help the party.\u201d\n\n[Gallup\u2019s latest survey finds 72 percent of respondents feel most members of Congress should not be re-elected.]\n\nThat\u2019s probably the only way to beat Ben Sasse - The Hill: \u201cPresident Obama told attendees at a high-dollar Manhattan fundraiser Wednesday night that the Democratic Party would be in better shape if he \u2018could just get a million surplus votes in Brooklyn\u2019 and move them to Nebraska, where Tea Party conservatives scored a major win in Tuesday\u2019s primary.\u201d\n\nLAND SLAMS WASHINGTON\u2019S WAR ON MICHIGAN IN NEW AD\n\nIn her latest ad, Michigan Republican Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land slams ObamaCare for turning full-time jobs into part-time jobs. Land appears on-camera saying, \u201cBecause of Washington\u2019s big bureaucracy, red tape regulation, we have fewer jobs. I\u2019ll downsize big government, cut the red tape, so Michiganders can create, invest, hire and grow again.\u201d\n\n\n\nPocketbook issue - Despite 51 Senators, including 36 Democrats, urging the Obama administration not to, it imposed the highest possible cuts on the home health care industry.

The top dispute in the seven-candidate field centered on remarks by the perceived front-runner, former Dollar General CEO David Perdue, during an editorial board meeting with The Telegraph newspaper in Macon, Ga. During the meeting, Perdue was asked about the nation's debt and whether it would be best to curb the growth of spending or increase revenue. Perdue interjected, saying \u2018both,\u2019 and the questioner added the latter would be \u2018a euphemism for some kind of tax increase, of course.\u2019 Perdue laughed and referenced his business experience\u2026Rep. Paul Broun [R-Ga.] condemned Perdue's \u2018arrogance\u2019 in thinking so many senators wouldn't understand what he was saying. Rep. Jack Kingston [R-Ga.], who has led in fundraising and has the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Perdue's tax increases would \u2018only hurt our economy.\u2019 But Karen Handel struck perhaps the harshest tone, saying Perdue's remarks \u2018should raise a question in everyone's mind.\u2019 \u2018Exactly who is this guy? He's not a conservative and I question whether he's even a Republican,\u2019 she said. Perdue's campaign called the attacks \u2018deceitful\u2019 and said Perdue was talking about increasing revenues by cutting spending and promoting pro-growth policies. \u2018He never said the phrase \u2018tax increase,\u2019\u2019\u2019 said campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey. \u2018David believes that tax increases hinder economic growth and destroy jobs.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nJACOBS FIRES BACK AT ERNST IN NEW AD\n\nThe Hill: \u201cBusinessman Mark Jacobs's (R) campaign is going after Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst (R) in their crowded Senate primary. In a new ad, Jacobs mocks Ernst's latest ad, which was shot at a gun range, saying she's \u2018firing blanks\u2019 when she says she's looking out for Iowans. \u2018In politics people do strange things to get elected, especially when they've got something to hide,\" the ad's narrator says as images from Ernst's ad appear. \u2018In the state Senate, Ernst voted to raise the gas tax and tax Internet purchases. Ernst skipped votes dealing with elderly abuse and human trafficking and missed 103 more votes this year when she didn't show up for work.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nUDALL THRASHED OVER KEYSTONE\n\nSen.

Blair, the 17-year-old daughter of West Virginia state Sen. Craig Blair, defeated incumbent Del. Larry Kump 872 votes to 728 votes in the Republican primary. It took her dad until age 44 to win the district, which he held until moving up to the Senate in 2010. Saira will be able to vote for herself this fall. She turns 18 in July. If she wins, as expected, in the heavily Republican district, Saira said she is willing to miss some classes at WVU, where she will matriculate this fall, if there are conflicting votes at the state house.\n\n[New on Fox News Radio - The Balance Of Power: Voting From The Comfort Of Your Own Home?
