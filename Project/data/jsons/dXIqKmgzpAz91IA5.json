Over the next few months, the girl, affectionately called Charlie, had frequent seizures lasting two to four hours, and she was hospitalized repeatedly. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Photos: Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web \u2013 By the time she was 3, Charlotte was having up to 300 grand mal seizures every week. Eventually she lost the ability to walk, talk and eat. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Photos: Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web \u2013 The seizures were so severe Charlotte's heart stopped a number of times. Doctors suggested putting the child in a medically induced coma to give her small, battered body a rest. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Photos: Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web \u2013 Her father, Matt Figi, found a similar case online in which medical marijuana helped a boy's seizures. The family decided to give it a try. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Photos: Charlotte's Web Charlotte's Web \u2013 The Figi family soon heard about the Stanley brothers, one of Colorado's largest marijuana growers and dispensary owners. These six brothers were crossbreeding a strain of marijuana low in THC, the compound in marijuana that's psychoactive, and high in CBD, which has medicinal properties but no psychoactivity.
