It was a wonky piece of legislation that attracted scant attention in the media and was quietly signed into law by the president .\nYet , it was hailed by both parties as increasing the nation 's preparedness for chemical or biological attacks , natural disasters and infectious diseases .

Burr would later step aside as chairman of the Intelligence Committee amid an investigation of his pre-pandemic stock sales .\nWeeks before it became clear to much of the public just how far behind the U.S. was on tests , lawmakers were raising the alarm .\nSen. Doug Jones ( D-Ala. ) said at the March 3 hearing , \u201c It 's inadequate , to say the least . \u201d\nSen. Patty Murray Patricia ( Patty ) Lynn MurrayA national testing strategy to safely reopen America Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic : Where was Congress ? The coronavirus crisis has cut the child care sector MORE ( Wash. ) , the top Democrat on HELP whose home state was the first one hit , grilled Trump administration officials on testing and was skeptical of their early promises , which were n't met .\nIn late February , Murray pointedly asked Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar , \u201c Is our country ready ? \u201d\nBera told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that policymakers had a false sense of complacency , partially because of early positive data coming from South Korea 's handling of the outbreak . South Korea had the capacity to carry out many more tests than the U.S. and also had learned lessons from prior SARS and MERS outbreaks .\nBut Bera said this sense of complacency also came because lawmakers had a lot of trust in the CDC based on its track record .\nThe agency \u2019 s reputation has taken a major hit from the coronavirus . The CDC initially designed a flawed test for COVID-19 , one of many missteps the administration made on testing .\n\u201c This is the CDC , \u201d Bera told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It never occurred to me that it would n't be the best test in the world . \u201d\nIn late January , House Democratic appropriators pushed the White House to seek an emergency supplemental measure dedicated to the coronavirus . The administration proposed $ 2.5 billion , which was immediately attacked as too meager .\nAfter some squabbling , Trump on March 6 signed an $ 8.3 billion supplemental as more than 200 people in the U.S. in 18 states had tested positive .\nThe $ 8.3 billion figure is a stunningly small amount in the wake of recent COVID-19 legislation . Since then , a total of nearly $ 3 trillion has been enacted \u2014 with House Democrats pushing for another $ 3 trillion in relief .\nCongress was far from the only institution or figure that can be accused of underestimating the crisis .\nIn January , the World Health Organization stated it \u201c doesn \u2019 t recommend limiting trade and movement \u201d and publicly praised China for its \u201c transparency \u201d and handling of the virus .\nAnthony Fauci Anthony FauciFauci says coronavirus his 'worst nightmare ' and far from over \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Coronavirus Report : Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan says there will be consequences from fraying US-China relations ; WHO walks back claims on asymptomatic spread of virus DC National Guard members called to respond to protests test positive for COVID-19 MORE , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) and one of the administration 's most trusted voices , said in late January that the American public shouldn \u2019 t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very , very low risk to the United States , \u201d Fauci said , while adding , public health officials need to take the virus \u201c very seriously . \u201d\nMany lawmakers understandably sought to soothe the public , including Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander Andrew ( Lamar ) Lamar AlexanderTrump tweets spark fresh headache for Republicans Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic : Where was Congress ? Murkowski , Mattis criticism ratchets up pressure on GOP over Trump MORE ( R-Tenn. ) .\nAt the March 3 HELP hearing , Alexander read from a front-page New York Times story stating , \u201c With its top-notch scientists , modern hospitals and sprawling public health infrastructure , most experts agree , the United States is among the countries best prepared to prevent or manage such an epidemic . \u201d\nWhile the article also raised the possibility that the U.S. could experience shortages in ventilators and personal protective equipment , Alexander stressed the need to get accurate information for the public . Fewer than 100 cases had been confirmed in the U.S. at the time .\nEarlier , Democrats and the administration sparred over the Trump administration 's proposal to cut the budgets of public health agencies . The White House knew Congress was n't going to pass the cuts , which attracted criticism from some Republicans as well .\nRep. Anna Eshoo Anna Georges EshooExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic : Where was Congress ? Hillicon Valley : Conspiracy theories run rampant online amid Floyd protests | First lawsuit filed against Trump social media order | Snapchat to no longer promote Trump 's account Democratic lawmakers push leadership to ensure college students have internet access MORE ( D-Calif. ) , chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Health , pressed Azar in February about whether the administration should revise its budget plan for health agencies , citing the coronavirus and various proposed cuts .\nBattered by bad headlines , the Trump administration three weeks later upped its budget requests for CDC and NIAID by $ 1.3 billion and $ 440 million , respectively , which put them near current funding levels .\nThe coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. during a historically divisive political moment that has contributed to a faulty response by the government .\nTrump mentioned the coronavirus in his Feb. 4 State of the Union address , which began with him refusing to shake Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSanders endorses Engel challenger in New York primary \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Morning Report - Dems , GOP already headed in different directions on policing reforms Biden , Democrats seek to shut down calls to defund police MORE \u2019 s ( D-Calif. ) hand and ended with her ripping up a copy of his speech .\nThe address was given a day before the Senate voted to acquit Trump on impeachment charges .\nTrump touched on the virus briefly in a paragraph sandwiched between opioid abuse and AIDS . And he sounded a positive note toward China , something that would dramatically change in subsequent weeks .\n\u201c Protecting Americans \u2019 health also means fighting infectious diseases , \u201d he said . \u201c We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China . My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat . \u201d\nFrom early to mid-February , the Trump administration was regularly briefing Congress on the spread of the virus . But it refused early requests to appear publicly in the House and Senate . The administration did not appear at the first House hearing on Feb. 5 and also declined to testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee a week later .\nSen. Ron Johnson Ronald ( Ron ) Harold JohnsonExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic : Where was Congress ? GOP 's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst Graham postpones Russia probe subpoena vote as tensions boil over MORE ( R-Wis. ) , an ally of the president who chairs the Senate panel , said he was `` disappointed '' the administration did n't send any representatives .\nA former Trump administration official , Scott Gottlieb , told Johnson 's committee that the coronavirus was \u201c deeply concerning. \u201d Gottlieb , who headed the Food and Drug Administration , said , \u201c I think what we should be worried about is n't the cases we know about . It 's the cases that we do n't know about . And there are certainly cases we do n't know about . \u201d\nThere were 13 confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases at that point .\nDemocratic leaders , including Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerSchumer on Trump 's tweet about 75-year-old protester : He 'should go back to hiding in the bunker ' Democrats unveil sweeping legislation in response to protests of police brutality Pelosi , Schumer kneel in silence for almost 9 minutes to honor George Floyd MORE ( D-N.Y. ) , have lambasted Trump 's handling of the virus .\nTrump and other Republicans have noted that Pelosi visited San Francisco \u2019 s Chinatown in late February , encouraging people to go there to eat and shop . Fact-checkers have noted Trump \u2019 s subsequent comments about that press event significantly exaggerated what she said .\nPelosi in May said Trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus given that he is `` morbidly obese , '' a personal insult out of character for the Speaker . Trump has called her \u201c crazy Nancy \u201d and accused her of drinking on the job .\nLawmakers and Trump were able to come together to pass massive bills to help the economy in March , though they are now at loggerheads on a new relief bill even as millions more Americans file for unemployment .\nIt has all highlighted how the broad bipartisanship after national crises \u2014 such as 9/11 \u2014 are likely a thing of the past . Sweeping reforms to the law , including ObamaCare and the Trump tax cuts , are rammed through on a partisan basis . Oversight of the executive branch by the opposing party is now marked by defying subpoenas and drawn-out battles in the courts .\nRoss K. Baker , a professor of political science at Rutgers University who has served as a Senate fellow , said there were no powerful heroes on Capitol Hill who saw what was coming . He also pointed out both parties were preoccupied with impeachment in the beginning of the year as the virus spread around the globe .\nWhile noting that the executive branch is most responsible for combating a pandemic , Baker said the White House has been usurping power from Congress since the 19th century . That dynamic , he said , has basically left the legislative branch watching from the sidelines .\nBy and large , the initial reaction from the Democratic-led House and the Republican-controlled Senate was similar . The narrative on Capitol Hill was the virus would likely affect the U.S. , but the country 's health care system was the best in the world and the experts were on top of it .\nMany comparisons were made to the flu as legislators noted the flu kills tens of thousands of people in America per year . Others said the coronavirus was primarily a threat to the sick and the elderly .\nAfter Trump administration officials gave the Senate a classified briefing on the coronavirus on Feb. 25 , Democrats and Republicans both questioned the need for the information to be labeled secret .\nYet the reaction of the parties was overall quite different . Republican senators generally expressed optimism to the press on the federal response , noting that outside of a cruise ship , U.S. cases had held steady at 14 for roughly a week . Democrats , such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( Conn. ) , raised significant concerns .\nBlumenthal , a frequent critic of Trump , said an outbreak in the U.S. was \u201c virtually inevitable. \u201d He added there would be an outcry if the American people \u201c heard what we were told . \u201d\nWhile many Republicans were downplaying the threat , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles ( Chuck ) Ernest GrassleyOn The Money : Key Democrat accuses Labor chief of 'misleading ' testimony | Warren urges bank regulator to scrap anti-redlining rule rewrite | Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks Key Democrat accuses Labor head of 'misleading ' testimony on jobless benefits Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks MORE ( R-Iowa ) took a different tack : \u201c While the coronavirus is not yet a pandemic , there are signs that it could develop into a worldwide threat . Based on public reports , I \u2019 m concerned that China may not be accurately reflecting the scale or scope of the problem or sharing information with global health organizations . \u201d\nThe stock market plummeted that day with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 880 points in a spiral that would continue for weeks .\nEven though U.S. policymakers were late to comprehend the severity of COVID-19 , Baker said they did come together to pass massive bills on relief packages relatively quickly .\nGoing forward , Baker is optimistic that the White House and Congress will strike one more deal on another major stimulus measure .\nAfter that , Baker said , \u201c We 'll be deep in the presidential election season . \u201d",

The coronavirus could result in a global pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe conservative National Review magazine highlighted the concerns raised by Cotton, who is considered to be a possible presidential candidate in 2024.\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee Sheila Jackson LeeMore than 6000 attend George Floyd's Houston viewing Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Democrats seek to tap into fury over George Floyd MORE (D-Texas), Cotton\u2019s ideologic opposite, in February delivered several speeches on the House floor, highlighting dangers of the virus and criticizing the administration's response to it.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahyCan he really do that? Yes, he probably can \u2014 because Congress let him Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? GOP's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst MORE (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee who is the dean of the upper chamber, delivered a Feb. 12 speech on the Senate floor that called for funding hikes, highlighting the 2020 outbreaks of Ebola and the coronavirus. Leahy didn't forecast how bad the coronavirus would become, but he recognized the potential scope of spreading diseases.\n\n\u201cToday, we are struggling to control outbreaks of Ebola and the novel coronavirus,\u201d Leahy said, \u201cand while we don\u2019t know which viruses will next attack us, we do know it is not a matter of if, but when ... Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of lives could be lost, and the amount of funding necessary to control it would be incalculable.\u201d\n\nLater on, lawmakers were pinpointing problems early that would become national outrages.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis Nadler Floyd's brother to testify in front of House Judiciary Committee hearing on police brutality House Judiciary Committee to hold hearing on police brutality next week House Judiciary to hear whistleblowers on 'politicization' of Justice Dept under Trump MORE (D-N.Y.) on March 12 urged the administration to take precautions to protect people who are incarcerated two weeks before the first prisoner died. There are more than 40,000 cases of the coronavirus reported among prisoners, according to a joint tracking project by the Marshall Project and The Associated Press.\n\nDuring panel hearings in late February and early March, various members including Sens.

Democrats call for special prosecutor to investigate clearing of protesters outside White House The Hill's Coronavirus Report: Johns Hopkins's Jennifer Nuzzo says America needs public health crisis insurance to pay for COVID-19 victims; Protests, pandemic continue to ravage America MORE (D-R.I.) homed in on the country's lack of masks and other medical equipment for health care workers.\n\nRomney said at a March 3 Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing that he was \u201cmost concerned\u201d after being told the U.S. would need 3.5 billion masks, but only had 35 million in the national stockpile.\n\nWeeks later, the personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage became front-page news as doctors and nurses were forced to improvise, wearing scarves and bandanas and reusing medical equipment.\n\nA pandemic bill\n\nIn June 2019, less than a year before the coronavirus would shut down the country, Congress passed a reauthorization bill on pandemics. It was a wonky piece of legislation that attracted scant attention in the media and was quietly signed into law by the president.\n\nYet, it was hailed by both parties as increasing the nation's preparedness for chemical or biological attacks, natural disasters and infectious diseases. But the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act (PAHPA) did little to stave off the coronavirus.\n\nAs the coronavirus news got worse, there was frustration among some members that they had already enacted a recent law to control such a disease.\n\nSen. Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Trump asserts his power over Republicans FISA 'reform': Groundhog Day edition MORE (R-N.C.), a co-author of PAHPA who sits on the HELP panel, pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March on the implementation of the 2019 law \u2014 specifically on the allocation of the money that Congress approved. Burr would later step aside as chairman of the Intelligence Committee amid an investigation of his pre-pandemic stock sales.\n\nWeeks before it became clear to much of the public just how far behind the U.S. was on tests, lawmakers were raising the alarm.\n\nSen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said at the March 3 hearing, \u201cIt's inadequate, to say the least.\u201d\n\nSen. Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayA national testing strategy to safely reopen America Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? The coronavirus crisis has cut the child care sector MORE (Wash.), the top Democrat on HELP whose home state was the first one hit, grilled Trump administration officials on testing and was skeptical of their early promises, which weren't met.\n\nIn late February, Murray pointedly asked Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, \u201cIs our country ready?\u201d\n\nBera told The Hill that policymakers had a false sense of complacency, partially because of early positive data coming from South Korea's handling of the outbreak. South Korea had the capacity to carry out many more tests than the U.S. and also had learned lessons from prior SARS and MERS outbreaks.\n\nBut Bera said this sense of complacency also came because lawmakers had a lot of trust in the CDC based on its track record.\n\nThe agency\u2019s reputation has taken a major hit from the coronavirus. The CDC initially designed a flawed test for COVID-19, one of many missteps the administration made on testing.\n\n\u201cThis is the CDC,\u201d Bera told The Hill. \u201cIt never occurred to me that it wouldn't be the best test in the world.\u201d\n\nBudget battles underscore how Congress underestimated threat\n\nIn late January, House Democratic appropriators pushed the White House to seek an emergency supplemental measure dedicated to the coronavirus. The administration proposed $2.5 billion, which was immediately attacked as too meager.\n\nAfter some squabbling, Trump on March 6 signed an $8.3 billion supplemental as more than 200 people in the U.S. in 18 states had tested positive.\n\nThe $8.3 billion figure is a stunningly small amount in the wake of recent COVID-19 legislation. Since then, a total of nearly $3 trillion has been enacted \u2014 with House Democrats pushing for another $3 trillion in relief.\n\nCongress was far from the only institution or figure that can be accused of underestimating the crisis.\n\nIn January, the World Health Organization stated it \u201cdoesn\u2019t recommend limiting trade and movement\u201d and publicly praised China for its \u201ctransparency\u201d and handling of the virus.\n\nAnthony Fauci Anthony FauciFauci says coronavirus his 'worst nightmare' and far from over The Hill's Coronavirus Report: Singapore Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan says there will be consequences from fraying US-China relations; WHO walks back claims on asymptomatic spread of virus DC National Guard members called to respond to protests test positive for COVID-19 MORE, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and one of the administration's most trusted voices, said in late January that the American public shouldn\u2019t worry about the coronavirus outbreak in China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very low risk to the United States,\u201d Fauci said, while adding, public health officials need to take the virus \u201cvery seriously.\u201d\n\nMany lawmakers understandably sought to soothe the public, including Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderTrump tweets spark fresh headache for Republicans Exclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Murkowski, Mattis criticism ratchets up pressure on GOP over Trump MORE (R-Tenn.).\n\nAt the March 3 HELP hearing, Alexander read from a front-page New York Times story stating, \u201cWith its top-notch scientists, modern hospitals and sprawling public health infrastructure, most experts agree, the United States is among the countries best prepared to prevent or manage such an epidemic.\u201d\n\nWhile the article also raised the possibility that the U.S. could experience shortages in ventilators and personal protective equipment, Alexander stressed the need to get accurate information for the public. Fewer than 100 cases had been confirmed in the U.S. at the time.\n\nEarlier, Democrats and the administration sparred over the Trump administration's proposal to cut the budgets of public health agencies. The White House knew Congress wasn't going to pass the cuts, which attracted criticism from some Republicans as well.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo Anna Georges EshooExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? Hillicon Valley: Conspiracy theories run rampant online amid Floyd protests | First lawsuit filed against Trump social media order | Snapchat to no longer promote Trump's account Democratic lawmakers push leadership to ensure college students have internet access MORE (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Health, pressed Azar in February about whether the administration should revise its budget plan for health agencies, citing the coronavirus and various proposed cuts.\n\n\u201cNothing to reconsider?\u201d Eshoo asked.\n\n\u201cI don't believe there is,\u201d Azar responded.\n\nBattered by bad headlines, the Trump administration three weeks later upped its budget requests for CDC and NIAID by $1.3 billion and $440 million, respectively, which put them near current funding levels.\n\nPartisan battles\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. during a historically divisive political moment that has contributed to a faulty response by the government.\n\nTrump mentioned the coronavirus in his Feb. 4 State of the Union address, which began with him refusing to shake Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSanders endorses Engel challenger in New York primary The Hill's Morning Report - Dems, GOP already headed in different directions on policing reforms Biden, Democrats seek to shut down calls to defund police MORE\u2019s (D-Calif.) hand and ended with her ripping up a copy of his speech.\n\nThe address was given a day before the Senate voted to acquit Trump on impeachment charges.\n\nTrump touched on the virus briefly in a paragraph sandwiched between opioid abuse and AIDS. And he sounded a positive note toward China, something that would dramatically change in subsequent weeks.\n\n\u201cProtecting Americans\u2019 health also means fighting infectious diseases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\u201d\n\nFrom early to mid-February, the Trump administration was regularly briefing Congress on the spread of the virus. But it refused early requests to appear publicly in the House and Senate. The administration did not appear at the first House hearing on Feb. 5 and also declined to testify before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee a week later.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonExclusive investigation on the coronavirus pandemic: Where was Congress? GOP's Obama-era probes fuel Senate angst Graham postpones Russia probe subpoena vote as tensions boil over MORE (R-Wis.), an ally of the president who chairs the Senate panel, said he was \"disappointed\" the administration didn't send any representatives.\n\nA former Trump administration official, Scott Gottlieb, told Johnson's committee that the coronavirus was \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Gottlieb, who headed the Food and Drug Administration, said, \u201cI think what we should be worried about isn't the cases we know about. It's the cases that we don't know about. And there are certainly cases we don't know about.\u201d\n\nThere were 13 confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases at that point.\n\nDemocratic leaders, including Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerSchumer on Trump's tweet about 75-year-old protester: He 'should go back to hiding in the bunker' Democrats unveil sweeping legislation in response to protests of police brutality Pelosi, Schumer kneel in silence for almost 9 minutes to honor George Floyd MORE (D-N.Y.), have lambasted Trump's handling of the virus.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have noted that Pelosi visited San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown in late February, encouraging people to go there to eat and shop. Fact-checkers have noted Trump\u2019s subsequent comments about that press event significantly exaggerated what she said.\n\nPelosi in May said Trump should not be taking hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus given that he is \"morbidly obese,\" a personal insult out of character for the Speaker. Trump has called her \u201ccrazy Nancy\u201d and accused her of drinking on the job.\n\nLawmakers and Trump were able to come together to pass massive bills to help the economy in March, though they are now at loggerheads on a new relief bill even as millions more Americans file for unemployment.\n\nIt has all highlighted how the broad bipartisanship after national crises \u2014 such as 9/11 \u2014 are likely a thing of the past. Sweeping reforms to the law, including ObamaCare and the Trump tax cuts, are rammed through on a partisan basis. Oversight of the executive branch by the opposing party is now marked by defying subpoenas and drawn-out battles in the courts.\n\nNo heroes\n\nRoss K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University who has served as a Senate fellow, said there were no powerful heroes on Capitol Hill who saw what was coming. He also pointed out both parties were preoccupied with impeachment in the beginning of the year as the virus spread around the globe.\n\nWhile noting that the executive branch is most responsible for combating a pandemic, Baker said the White House has been usurping power from Congress since the 19th century. That dynamic, he said, has basically left the legislative branch watching from the sidelines.\n\nBy and large, the initial reaction from the Democratic-led House and the Republican-controlled Senate was similar. The narrative on Capitol Hill was the virus would likely affect the U.S., but the country's health care system was the best in the world and the experts were on top of it.\n\nMany comparisons were made to the flu as legislators noted the flu kills tens of thousands of people in America per year. Others said the coronavirus was primarily a threat to the sick and the elderly.\n\nAfter Trump administration officials gave the Senate a classified briefing on the coronavirus on Feb. 25, Democrats and Republicans both questioned the need for the information to be labeled secret.\n\nYet the reaction of the parties was overall quite different. Republican senators generally expressed optimism to the press on the federal response, noting that outside of a cruise ship, U.S. cases had held steady at 14 for roughly a week. Democrats, such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), raised significant concerns.\n\nBlumenthal, a frequent critic of Trump, said an outbreak in the U.S. was \u201cvirtually inevitable.\u201d He added there would be an outcry if the American people \u201cheard what we were told.\u201d\n\nWhile many Republicans were downplaying the threat, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyOn The Money: Key Democrat accuses Labor chief of 'misleading' testimony | Warren urges bank regulator to scrap anti-redlining rule rewrite | Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks Key Democrat accuses Labor head of 'misleading' testimony on jobless benefits Senators press IG to act to prevent nursing homes from seizing coronavirus checks MORE (R-Iowa) took a different tack: \u201cWhile the coronavirus is not yet a pandemic, there are signs that it could develop into a worldwide threat. Based on public reports, I\u2019m concerned that China may not be accurately reflecting the scale or scope of the problem or sharing information with global health organizations.\u201d\n\nThe stock market plummeted that day with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 880 points in a spiral that would continue for weeks.\n\nEven though U.S. policymakers were late to comprehend the severity of COVID-19, Baker said they did come together to pass massive bills on relief packages relatively quickly.\n\nGoing forward, Baker is optimistic that the White House and Congress will strike one more deal on another major stimulus measure.\n\nAfter that, Baker said, \u201cWe'll be deep in the presidential election season.\u201d",
