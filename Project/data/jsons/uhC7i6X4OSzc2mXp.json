    "content": "A possible breakthrough legislative proposal on gun background checks was met with a mixed response ahead of a key test vote Thursday , with the White House giving its blessing while some top Republicans and gun rights groups still voiced concerns .\nSenate Democrats plowed ahead with a planned test vote on the sweeping gun control legislation . The so-called cloture vote is set for 11 a.m . ET Thursday , and a congressional aide told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Democrats are likely to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to proceed toward debate and eventually a final vote . They will face resistance from more than a dozen Republican senators , including Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , who have vowed to try to block the legislation .\nA compromise struck between conservative Sens . Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , and Patrick Toomey , R-Pa. , boosted the legislation 's chances and earned praise from President Obama .\n`` I applaud Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their leadership on forging a bipartisan agreement around commonsense background checks that will make it harder for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun , '' Obama said in a written statement . `` This is not my bill , and there are aspects of the agreement that I might prefer to be stronger . But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress . ''\nBut Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla. , echoed many Republicans in calling it `` a good-faith but unworkable plan . ''\n`` The proposal will impose new taxes and unreasonable burdens on law-abiding citizens . The agreement also prioritizes collecting records over protecting citizens , '' Coburn said . `` This is the wrong approach . Preventing sales to dangerous persons , not collecting receipts , will save lives . ''\nThe National Rifle Association followed up with its own criticism of the proposal .\n`` Expanding background checks at gun shows will not prevent the next shooting , will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools , '' the NRA said . `` The sad truth is that no background check would have prevented the tragedies in Newtown , Aurora or Tucson . ''\nOther Republicans voiced concern that the legislation being voted on Thursday still included the older background check measure . Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , who plans to vote against proceeding on Thursday , said that background check provision would be a `` clear overreach . ''\n`` The following offenses would now be federal crimes absent surrendering their firearms and conducting a background check . Federal offenses : an uncle giving his nephew a hunting rifle for Christmas ; a niece giving her aunt a handgun for protection ; a cousin loaning another cousin his hunting rifle if the loan occurs just one day before the beginning of hunting season , '' he said .\nThe Manchin-Toomey plan would be voted on later as an amendment . Manchin and Toomey both have received `` A '' ratings from the NRA , and their endorsements could make it easier for hesitant colleagues to back the effort .\nGun control advocates still face opposition from many Republican senators and resistance from moderate Democrats , including several facing re-election next year in GOP-leaning states . In the Republican-run House , leaders have shown little enthusiasm for Obama 's ideas , making that chamber an even higher hurdle .\nUnder the agreement the two senators announced at the Capitol , background checks would be expanded to all for-profit transactions including sales at gun shows and online , with records kept by licensed gun-dealers who would handle the paperwork . Exempted would be noncommercial transactions such as between relatives . Currently , the system applies only to sales by the country 's 55,000 federally licensed firearms dealers .\nThe agreement also contains provisions expanding firearms rights , and that concerns gun control supporters . Some restrictions on transporting guns across state lines would be eased , sellers would be shielded from lawsuits if the buyer passed a check but later used a firearm in a crime and gun dealers could conduct business in states where they do n't live .\n`` Truly the events at Newtown changed us all , '' said Manchin , citing the Connecticut town where December 's murders of 20 first-graders and six educators propelled gun control to the top rank of national issues . `` Americans on both sides of the debate can and must find common ground . ''\nEmotion , always prominent in the gun issue , cropped up late Wednesday when Manchin met with relatives of the Newtown victims in his Senate office , telling them that `` this will not be in vain . '' He became choked up when a reporter asked about the impact of the family members ' visit , saying , `` I 'm a parent , a grandparent ... and I had to do something . ''\nSaid Toomey : `` Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill should n't have guns . I do n't know anyone who disagrees with that premise . '' He said that expanding the checks was n't gun control , `` just common sense . ''\nThe agreement makes it all but certain that the Senate will reject a conservative blockade and vote Thursday to begin debating Democrats ' gun legislation . Besides broader background check requirements , the bill would also toughen laws against illicit firearms sales and provide a small increase in school security aid .\nUnderscoring that the fight was far from over , NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the organization opposes the Manchin-Toomey accord . The group , which has fought most of Obama 's gun proposals and claims nearly 5 million members , said the focus should be on improving the nation 's mental health system and sources of violence like gangs .\n`` Expanding background checks at gun shows will not prevent the next shooting , will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools , '' the NRA said .\nOn a day when first lady Michelle Obama was visiting a violence-plagued high school in Chicago , the Obamas ' hometown , the NRA said , `` President Obama should be as committed to dealing with the gang problem that is tormenting honest people in his hometown as he is to blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers . ''\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , repeated his view that the Senate should act , saying , `` It 's one thing for two members to come to some agreement . It does n't substitute the will for the other 98 members . ''\nIn a written statement , Obama said he 'd prefer stronger language than the compromise , but he said it represented progress .\n`` It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue , and we do n't have to agree on everything to know that we 've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence , '' he said .\nOther highlights of Obama 's gun agenda -- including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines -- seem to have little chance of winning approval in the Senate , let alone the House .\nPolls show more than 8 in 10 people back expanded background checks . Even so , the fight will be difficult in both chambers , especially the House , where increasing numbers of district lines are drawn to protect incumbents , said James Pasco , executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police .\n`` They 're not going to have a constituency in every instance that is champing for that bill , '' said Pasco , whose group has backed the drive for expanded background checks .\nThe director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns , one of whose leaders is New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , said the compromise was a major improvement and showed that Republican support was possible .\n`` Opposing yet another reform , which has Americans scratching their heads , is not a place where a national political party can afford to be , '' said Mark Glaze .\nReflecting concerns about unseen details about some gun rights language , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence took a more tempered view .\n`` While we continue to review the legislation , we believe a majority of the components are a good step forward , '' said Brian Malte , director of the campaign 's network mobilization .\nThere are no current , definitive statistics on how many gun sales occur annually and what portion occurs without the checks .
