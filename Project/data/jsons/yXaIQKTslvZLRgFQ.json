She suspects her father , former Utah governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman , supported gay marriage even before publicly backing it in a 2013 op-ed .\nOlder Republicans , by and large , continue to oppose gay marriage , only a handful of Republican lawmakers publicly favor it , and none of the party \u2019 s presidential candidates have said they do . But the majority of young Republicans , like the majority of Americans , now support it .\nWith the Supreme Court preparing to hear oral arguments on same-sex marriage on Tuesday , the issue has become a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail , putting Republican discomfort with the issue in stark relief . Texas Senator Ted Cruz put out a statement last week affirming his stance against gay marriage , after news reports emerged that he attended a reception for him hosted by two gay hoteliers . He reportedly said at the event that he would not love his daughters any differently if they were gay .\nIn interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the children of prominent Republican politicians say they \u2019 ve seen their own parents struggle with and evolve in their views of marriage equality .\nIn 2013 , as Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was considering a vote for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , which would protect gay and transgender people , he posed a question to his son Ryan as the two sat in his Washington office . \u201c Do you think homosexuality is a choice ? \u201d Flake asked , according to Ryan .\nRyan , whose best friend and cousin had just come out , sending \u201c shockwaves \u201d through their conservative Mormon family , told his dad no , not usually .\n\u201c He just sat there and pondered it for a while , \u201d Ryan said . \u201c That got to me . He was really trying to gather opinions . \u201d\nLater that year , Democrat Tammy Baldwin , the nation \u2019 s first openly gay senator , approached Flake to lobby his support for the bill . She asked Flake to speak with a conservative Republican lawmaker with a transgender child ( that child is still a minor , and Ryan declined to share the lawmaker \u2019 s name ) . That conversation , Flake \u2019 s office confirmed , helped seal what the LGBT magazine the Advocate called his \u201c surprise \u201d vote in favor of the bill .\nSince then , Ryan has become an increasingly avid advocate for gays and lesbians . Earlier this month , he marched in the Phoenix Pride parade . He \u2019 s joined pro-gay marriage Mormon groups and started volunteering at a shelter for LGBT youth . Ryan told his father that he thinks the young people he works with should be able to get married one day \u2013 and he describes his dad as a good listener .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not saying he supports marriage equality . I can \u2019 t say that . I just can \u2019 t comment on that , \u201d said Ryan . \u201c I do think his views have evolved . He \u2019 s in a place in Washington , D.C. , where he \u2019 s had to deal with different people . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c Just as any other politician has to , there has to be a difference between private belief and what the majority may want . \u201d\nWhen asked about his current position on gay marriage , Jeff Flake said , through a spokeswoman , \u201c This issue is now in the hands of the courts . \u201d\nSome of the pleas are more personal . Matt R. Salmon \u2019 s parents were once among the staunchest opponents of gay marriage . His father , Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon , voted for a ban on gay adoption and for the Defense of Marriage Act . His mother , Nancy , led a failed 2006 campaign to amend Arizona \u2019 s constitution to ban not only gay marriage , but legal recognition of any kind for same-sex couples .\nAt the time , Matt was in \u201c reparative therapy \u201d to reverse the homosexuality that made him and his parents feel ashamed . In 2008 , he quit the therapy and embraced his sexual identity , coming out to friends and on Facebook as gay .\nHis parents , he said , have come to embrace it , too . \u201c If you want to know the truth , my father was the first to come around , \u201d said Matt . \u201c He \u2019 s been exposed to a lot more in his life , especially given his position . He \u2019 s been exposed to a lot more ideas that are different than his own . \u201d\nBut in 2013 , his father \u2014 who served in the House from 1995-2001 and returned to the chamber that year \u2014 said that despite his son \u2019 s identity , he continued to oppose gay marriage . But that \u2019 s not the full story , according to Matt . Later that year , as the two drove to a motorcycle expo in Scottsdale and discussed the media blow-up over the congressman \u2019 s comments , he confided in his son that he would happily attend his wedding , whenever that may be .\nSince then , said Matt , his parents have come around further in accepting his sexual identity . \u201c They \u2019 ve all only evolved more , to the point where they want to know about my dating life , where they want to know if anybody \u2019 s in my life making me happy . \u201d\nHis boyfriends have been \u201c welcomed with open arms \u201d at family events , and his mother has told him she will not involve herself again in anti-gay marriage campaigns . Matt said that conservative congressmen have approached his dad to thank him \u2013 his relationship with his son had helped them change their own views on LGBT issues .\nMatt said he \u2019 d love to go into the details of the conversations he \u2019 s had with his father on those issues but that he can \u2019 t . \u201c There are opinions that my father privately holds that are different from his political positions that make them difficult to share . ''\n\u201c Privately , things have evolved , \u201d Matt said of his father . \u201c As far as I know , his political stances haven \u2019 t changed . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s a private matter between him and his son , \u201d said a spokesman for the congressman .\nAttitudes toward gay marriage have shifted rapidly in recent years . In 2004 , as Massachusetts was sanctioning the nation \u2019 s first legal same-sex marriages , only 42 percent of Americans thought they should be valid , compared to 55 percent who thought they shouldn \u2019 t be , according to Gallup .\nA decade later , those numbers had reversed . The speed with which gay marriage and its acceptance has grown has often left politicians playing catch-up with the public \u2013 at least in public . Not long ago , those politicians were Democrats . In his new memoir , David Axelrod writes that , as many suspected , President Obama supported gay marriage back in 2008 even as he said that he opposed it . The president only came out to the nation in favor of gay marriage in 2012 , 16 years after state senate candidate Obama indicated his support for it on a questionnaire and long after his liberal base had embraced it .\nAs acceptance of gay marriage becomes more mainstream in the Republican Party , its leaders face a similar dilemma . Sixty-one percent of Republicans ages 18-29 favor gay marriage , compared to 22 percent of those age 65 and up . Within prominent Republican families , that divide means children \u2013 gay , transgender , and straight \u2014 are playing decisive roles in changing their parents \u2019 views .\nIn March 2013 , Sen . Rob Portman became the first Republican senator to announce his support for gay marriage , two years after his son Will came out to his parents as gay .\nLast summer , a lesbian relative of Scott Walker \u2019 s wife married another woman , and Walker \u2019 s son Alex acted as a witness . The Wisconsin governor has said that both of his sons have pushed the view that government should have no hand in regulating marriage . \u201c That \u2019 s a solid argument , \u201d Walker told Buzzfeed in 2013 . \u201c I personally may not embrace that yet . But that , to me , is a bigger question\u2026 I get their concerns . \u201d\nLast month , Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was one of 300 Republicans to sign on to an amicus brief in support of gay marriage filed with the Supreme Court . She \u2019 s said her transgender son Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen , who was born as a girl and came out to her parents as lesbian before identifying as a man , has influenced her views on gender and sexuality .\n\u201c One of the biggest ways that my sister and I influenced my mother \u2019 s views on LGBT issues was by simply speaking about them openly , \u201d said Heng-Lehtinen . \u201c Growing up , my sister Patty and I did not hide our LGBT friends nor shy away from discussing LGBT topics in the news . This was the case long before I came out as a transgender man . \u201d\nEarlier this month , Arkansas Gov . Asa Hutchinson refused to sign a \u201c religious freedom \u201d bill that critics said would have permitted discrimination against gays , citing the influence of his son Seth , a liberal labor organizer in Texas , who emailed his father about his objections to the bill .\nI didn \u2019 t really come up with any original arguments on it , \u201d said Seth Hutchinson \u2013 a sign that the messenger often matters as much as the message .\nArizona Sen. John McCain , right , waves as his daughter , Meghan McCain , looks on .
