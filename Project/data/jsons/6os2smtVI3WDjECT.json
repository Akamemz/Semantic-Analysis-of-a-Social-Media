    "content": "In the House , Democrats are inching ever closer to impeaching President Trump . Some are even pushing for drafting articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving and , potentially , sending proceedings to the Senate by early next year . If the charges reach the upper chamber , at least 20 Republicans would have to join every Democrat in voting guilty in order to reach the two-thirds supermajority needed to remove the president from office .\nSo now begins the reading of the tea leaves and the careful scrutiny of every Republican senator \u2019 s statements ( or silence ) . Will Republicans finally break with Trump ? We may not know until it happens . But be forewarned \u2014 if it does happen , it will likely take us by surprise . After all , political science has shown us that big political changes often come suddenly , after long periods of stasis . Looking back , it seems like of course the Soviet Union was bound to collapse . But up until the moment it did \u2014 and remember , it fell all at once \u2014 almost nobody predicted it .\nIt \u2019 s not exactly a secret that if congressional Republicans could hold a secret-ballot no-confidence vote , they \u2019 d probably vote to oust Trump . There \u2019 s just one problem with that logic ( aside from the fact that it \u2019 s not how our democracy works ) : Private preferences aside , congressional Republicans actually have some very strong incentives to support Trump publicly , at both the individual and collective level .\nTake those who have openly challenged the president . The few , like former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford or Alabama Rep. Martha Roby , have faced primary challengers as a result \u2014 Sanford lost his renomination bid , and Roby was forced into a runoff . Others , like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake simply retired , fearing tough reelection prospects . And this all adds up , contributing to the perception that Trump \u2019 s popularity is un-dentable among GOP voters . Republicans likely won \u2019 t individually take on Trump , unless , of course , his approval rating tanks and he becomes a liability to the party . But that \u2019 s only likely to happen if his fellow Republicans all turn against him . And therein lies the rub .\nCollectively , Republicans want to keep Trump popular so they can keep winning elections . In our era of increasingly nationalized politics , most Republicans can \u2019 t run independently of the president , even if they want to . Perhaps recognizing this , many have instead tied themselves more closely to him . Trump defines the Republican Party brand as president , so if Trump is unpopular , the Republican Party is unpopular , which would likely spell steep electoral losses for the party .\nThe only way this dynamic changes is if the entire Republican Party apparatus ( not just politicians , but also media commentators and surrogates ) turns on Trump en masse . But for this to happen , somebody still has to speak up first , and others have to follow . But it could happen . Let \u2019 s use political scientist Timur Kuran \u2019 s classic work , \u201c Private Truth , Public Lies : The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification , \u201d as a guide to understanding major political transformations . He argues that political regimes can persist despite being unpopular , which is why a government overthrow , when it does come , can often seem so sudden .\nConsider the Arab Spring , which began with one Tunisian vendor , who protested being mistreated by government officials by setting himself on fire . His death triggered a series of events , and a month later , the long-unpopular authoritarian Tunisian president fled the country after more than 23 years in power . A few weeks later , protesters in Egypt ousted their own long-serving authoritarian leader . What looked like ironclad power collapsed in a matter of weeks .

The logic is that there \u2019 s safety in numbers , so if multiple citizens rise up in protest of a regime , it signals that it \u2019 s OK to protest \u2014 which can cause decades-old regimes to collapse all at once .\nHow does this all factor into the politics of impeachment , exactly ? Well , the basic logic is the same \u2014 right now , Republicans in Congress aren \u2019 t willing to stand up to Trump , so there \u2019 s no sign that someone \u2019 s willing to be the first to go . Without a bold leader , there are no bold followers . But without the promise of bold followers , there are no bold leaders .\nWho goes first matters , too , because if we \u2019 re talking about a monumental sea change , it isn \u2019 t moderate Republicans like Sen.

Of course , the rub is that neither have spoken out against Trump \u2014 in fact , they \u2019 ve stuck by him \u2014 but that \u2019 s the point . If Republicans do abandon Trump over impeachment , it will be because of the senators least likely to strike out against Trump balked .\nEach new development potentially changes the calculus , too . For instance , last Tuesday , the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution calling on the Trump administration to release the whistleblower complaint that alleged the president had tried to coerce the Ukranian president to investigate Democratic front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden . The resolution signaled a surprising bipartisan willingness to let more information out .
