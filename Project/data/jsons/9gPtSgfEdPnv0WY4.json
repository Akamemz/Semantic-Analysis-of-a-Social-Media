Ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants . That 's what Donald Trump wants to do , either through constitutional amendment or aggressively court-challenging statute . This is n't a new conservative idea , and it 's something that plenty of other candidates have happily subscribed to for a conservative leg-up in the field .
