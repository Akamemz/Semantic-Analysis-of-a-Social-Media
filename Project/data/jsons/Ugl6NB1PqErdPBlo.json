    "content": "The week of May 8 to 15 closed a chapter in my life whose first pages were written in France before I made my 1947 debut , in New York City . My father \u2019 s first cousin , William Friedman , authored those pages by deed . Bill enlisted in the Army in 1938 and made the first of his three first-day World War II landings Nov. 8 , 1942 , in Oran , Algeria , with the First Division , whose storied nickname was the Big Red One . The North African campaign cost Bill the top joint on the middle finger of his right hand . On July 1 , 1943 Bill and his comrades landed in Sicily . Bill was transferred to the Tenth Mountain Division for the winter of 1944 , and then returned to the Big Red One , to prepare for the invasion of Normandy .\nLike most veterans Bill rarely spoke of his war days . He opened up to me a few times , once showing me letters he had written from France in 1944 ; then 27 , he wrote that he did not expect to see 28 . Bill first told his D-Day story to me around the time he attended the 40thanniversary commemoration at which President Reagan gave his legendary speech ( 14:25 ) about the men of Pointe du Hoc , the 225 Army Rangers who scaled the 300-foot high sheer cliff overlooking Omaha Beach in search of German artillery pieces . Starting with 250 in the boats , the Rangers ended the ferocious battle with 90 able to fight . But they did get the guns \u2014 not on the cliff summit , where none but dummy guns stood , but half a mile inland ; the Rangers used thermite grenades to melt the barrel interiors and then smashed the gun-sights with the butt of their rifles . Mission accomplished .\nBut it was ten years later , when Bill co-represented the Big Red One at the 50thanniversary celebration , and greeted President Clinton , that he told more of his story . Bill recalled the interminable voyage across the stormy English Channel ; he stood in the third row of his landing craft . As they approached the drop-off point in heavy seas the soldiers could hear the clatter of machine-gun bullets slamming into the prow of the ship . His regiment ( the 16th ) landed at Easy Red sector , the most heavily defended area , along with the neighboring Dog Green sector , of the beach that was to become known as \u201c Bloody Omaha. \u201d The First was chosen for this location because it was America \u2019 s most battle-hardened division .\nBill was interviewed for several TV specials . And then he sat down for interviews with soldier-author Tim Kilvert-Jones , writing the foreword for TK-J \u2019 s 1999 book , Omaha Beach : V Corps \u2019 Battle for the Normandy Beachhead .\nI am standing on Omaha Beach , May 14 , 2018 , holding open the Kilvert-Jones book , showing Bill \u2019 s Foreword to my fellow tourists . The photo at left is of Captain Friedman , 1943 . The photo at right shows Colonel Friedman ( USA , ret . ) greeting President Clinton at 1994 \u2019 s 50thanniversary D-Day celebration . Bill is second from right .\nBill described his first 24 hours at Normandy . Nearing the beach , 0810 hours , he saw chaos :\nLanding craft on their sides , turned the wrong way.\u2026 I had gone off the ramp into deep water . It was up to my chest . As we moved forward I must have been on a ridge of sand because the men around me began to go under and I had to help them stay above the waves . After going about 6 to 8 feet , I felt firm ground beneath me\u2026 I then moved quickly to the shingle and just lay down and joined that great big pile of men on the shale . We were totally immobilized . I did not know what to do , or where to go . I remember looking at the sea and the water was red , there were bodies and equipment just rolling in the surf\u2026 . Along the line of men on the shingle I saw men jerking as they were hit with the impact of bullets and shrapnel . Somehow it didn \u2019 t count . I was reassured because I was shoulder to shoulder with other men . There was something reassuring about having warm , familiar human bodies next to you\u2026 even if they were dead\u2026you were not alone\u2026 they provided comfort and sometimes even cover from the bullets\u2026 At one point I was still lying down and shouting in the ear of the Regimental S4 . He was a major . My mouth was next to his ear ; it was so noisy that he could not hear me otherwise . While I was trying to make myself heard above the din , a bullet struck him dead . It had hit him in the centre [ sic ] of his helmet\u2026 our faces were inches away when it happened\u2026 it could have been me .\nShortly after Bill landed , the commander of his group , Colonel George Taylor landed . Taylor took one look at the carnage and said , \u201c Two kinds of people are staying on this beach , the dead and those who are going to die\u2026 now let \u2019 s get the Hell out of here ! \u201d\nTaylor \u2019 s men had found a hidden defile , somehow not known to the Germans , who poured withering fire down exits E1 and E3 , the visible paths up from the beach , on either side of the defile .\nBill picked up his story after his unit reached the top of the bluffs :\nColonel Taylor sent me to find General Huebner.\u2026 I found the General and I said \u201c Colonel Taylor sends his respects , and presented my report. \u201d The general [ sic ] had tears in his eyes and all he could say was \u201c you did it\u2026 you did it ! \u201d He was deeply moved by the all too-evident sacrifice . Later that night I fell asleep in a farmyard around Colleville . I recall a sense of being purged . I had been frightened in battle before D-Day and again many times afterwards . But that day I was not frightened . I was simply convinced that we had absolutely no influence or control over our fate . No action we could take would have stopped a bullet . It was surreal . When I was awakened next morning it was by French women who gave me some Camembert cheese to eat and Calvados to drink . I had survived D-Day .\nBill fought with the Big Red One until the fall of Aachen , inside the Siegfried Line , on October 21 . He was recalled because his mother , widowed in 1943 , was seriously ill. ( Rose Friedman , a concert pianist , recovered and lived another 23 years . ) Bill stayed in the Army , and was sent to Korea in the fall of 1950 . He was at the Yalu River when the Chinese counterattack was launched . In all , Bill saw four years of combat . In addition to the Purple Heart , Bill was awarded two Silver Stars , four Bronze Stars , the Combat Infantryman \u2019 s Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster , and the highest decorations given by the governments of France and the Republic of Korea . A captain on D-Day , he left the Army in 1961 a full colonel . Bill passed away in 2002 , age 85 ; on his last trip he took me and his wife to what then was the D-Day Museum in New Orleans ; it later became the National World War II Museum . Bill was laid to rest at Arlington , with full military honors .\nOur group visits all five of the D-Day beach landings , which line up , west to east , on the Normandy peninsula : Utah and Omaha ( Americans ) , Gold ( British ) , Juno ( Canadian ) , and Sword ( British ) . Pointe du Hoc , offering a panoramic view of the peninsula , sits between Utah and Omaha beaches .\nMy Normandy visit , needless to say , was considerably less suspenseful . I wanted to make the trip so that I could stand at the waterline of Easy Red sector and see the landscape ( minus the hell of war ) my cousin saw . At low tide it is several hundred yards to the bluffs ; at high tide , perhaps one hundred . Looking down from the top , where the Normandy American Cemetery ( 2:54 ) holds the graves of 9,387 Americans , one can see how high up the German defenders were . The bluffs at their highest are about 50 meters \u2014 165 feet high ; this is more than half the height of the Ponte du Hoccliff , and the slope is steeper than it appears to the naked eye , covered as it is with foliage . We see the American Cemetery Memorial ( 4:30 ) with its glorious chapel .\nOur ace French guide , Pierre-Samuel Natanson , dispensed fascinating details of the many critical battles during the two-month Normandy campaign . I learned more in five days than I could in five months of reading about the battle . Seeing the battlefields leaves one with visuals that are worth the proverbial one thousand words .\nOur visit to Utah Beach includes Saint-M\u00e8re-\u00e9glise ( 2:11 ) , the church immortalized for filmgoers in The Longest Day ( 1962 ) . The parachute from which an unlucky parachutist famously dangled was actually on the back side of the church ; and there were two stranded paratroopers . Alas , Hollywood history favors cool pictures . The Battle of Fri\u00e8re Bridge ( 2:28 ) saw airborne troops knock out five enemy tanks , thus taking control of the bridge and providing an exit for troops on Utah Beach . We visit the Airborne Museum ( 2:04 ) honoring the 82ndand 101stairborne divisions . Finally we see Chateau Bernaville , where Gen. Erwin Rommel was once hosted . Rommel , in charge of defending Normandy , overseer of the Atlantic Wall fortifications the Germans built that ran from Norway to the France-Spain border , had predicted that the primary landing would be there . He wanted his fabled Panzer armored divisions stationed just behind the shore guns . He said that if the Allies escaped the beaches they would win . Fortunately , Hitler rejected his counsel . For the Big Red One , Normandy was revenge for the defeat Rommel \u2019 s Afrika Corps inflicted in Feb. 1943 on the Americans at Kasserine Pass .\nWe do a driving tour of Gold , Juno , and Sword beaches . We begin at Pegasus Bridge ( depicted : the modern , restored bridge ) , site of a spectacular three-glider landing , with pinpoint accuracy by superb pilots , landing without benefit of powered flight . The Battle of Pegasus Bridge seized for the Allies a key crossing point . We visit the Pegasus Bridge Museum , and see a Horsa glider , workhorse for the British during the War . We visit the Grand Bunker Museum ( 1:08 ) at Ouisterham . The Cin\u00e9ma Circulaire at the Normandy World War II Museum shows a film of the battle on nine huge panels at once . The day ends with a stop at Longues-Sur-Merto see a fortified German artillery piece . Our final touring day covers the many sites of the Falaise Pocket ( Falaise is French for cliff ) , where in late August 1944 the Allies ended the Battle of Normandy in a furious multi-day battle , one of the most sanguinary of the two month campaign . Atop Hill 262 ( named for its actual height in meters \u2014 about 859 feet ) we get a panoramic view of the sites involved in the complex serial engagements , virtually impossible to visualize without seeing the big picture . We see the Falaise Castle , located in the town that was birthplace for William The Conqueror , whose triumph at the Battle of Hastings ( 1066 ) brought Norman culture to Saxon England .\nBut for me the highlight of our group \u2019 s visit comes at a farm named Br\u00e9court Manor , near the town of Sainte Marie du Mont . It was the setting for a key American battle after breaking out from Utah Beach , the other American landing site on June 6 . The battle , depicted in Episode 2 of the popular Band of Brothers TV series , saw Americans destroy four German howitzers .\nThe rest of the story , told to us by the current owner , who was a boy back then , turned ugly when a soldier made a grievous error upon entering the farmhouse . He accidentally shot and seriously wounded the father . Fortunately , prompt medical attention , and nearly a year \u2019 s stay in a London hospital , enabled the man to recover . He returned home , and in 1949 was elected town mayor . In 1962 he presided over a ceremony honoring the liberation of the town . I told the farmer that I had two reasons for visiting Normandy . First was to honor my cousin , whose extraordinary service enabled me to live a freer , better life than would otherwise have been the case . Second , I wanted to thank the locals for the care their ancestors gave my cousin and his comrades .\nNext year will mark the 75thanniversary of D-Day . It will be the last major celebration of the largest naval invasion force in history , one that succeeded against overwhelming odds .\nNormandy has many charms that complement the war sites and memorials . The lovely countryside has recovered from the ghastly destruction of 1944 . The magnificent cathedral of Mont-San-Michel ( 1:42 ) towers over the countryside . Blending medieval , Gothic , and Baroque architectures accumulated over a millennium , it towers over its tidal basin \u2014 to see the view you must ascend 350 stone steps . At various times a fort and prison as well as a cathedral , it has survived the second highest tides on the planet . Caen \u2019 s abbeys were less fortunate ; they survive as fragments \u2014 the Normandy battle saw 70 percent of the town destroyed . Bayeux Cathedral has its charms , but the highlight of our visit to Bayeux is the famous Bayeux Tapestry ( 22:40 ) . My favorite panel is 38 , depicting what looks to my gimlet eye like four medieval go-go dancers .\nChurches , chateaux and country houses glow in the afternoon sun . Perhaps best of all , we lucked out on the weather , mostly sunny , rare for the region in May ( or anytime ) . The people were charming and hospitable to Americans , not the case in myriad places around the planet . And then there is la cuisine Normande .\nBill was quite the gustatory gourmet . I too , enjoyed Camembert \u2014 Normandy \u2019 s signature cheese \u2014 and Calvados . Thanks to Bill .\nJohn C. Wohlstetter is author of Sleepwalking With the Bomb ( 2d Ed . 2014 ) .",
