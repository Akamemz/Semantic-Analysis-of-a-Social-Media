Jason Chaffetz , R-Utah , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHe noted the documents released late Wednesday -- a release long sought by Republicans -- for the most part covered two days of communications . `` What about the ones before and what about all the ones after ? Let 's go ahead and release those as well , '' Chaffetz said .\nThe administration gave no indication that more documents would be forthcoming . White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the decision to make the records public was an `` extraordinary step . '' He said `` hopefully '' Washington can now move beyond the controversy .\nDemocratic Sen. Bob Menendez also said on the Senate floor Thursday that the issue has been `` fully vetted . ''\nThe information contained in the emails and notes released Wednesday depicted how several different agencies were deeply involved in editing and polishing the administration 's internal story-line on Benghazi in the days following the attack . They showed how State Department officials in particular voiced concern that references to prior attacks and security warnings could be used to criticize the administration -- those references were later stripped .\nFurther , they showed how references to Al Qaeda and Islamic extremists were ultimately removed as well .\nSome Republicans refrained from calling for more documents . Sen. Saxby Chambliss , R-Ga. , vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee , said in a statement he was `` glad '' to see the White House publish the talking points . `` I have been pushing for the release of this paper trail for weeks , '' he said .\nThe office of House Speaker John Boehner called the release `` long overdue , '' but also indicated it wanted to see more . Spokesman Brendan Buck said `` there are relevant documents the administration has still refused to produce '' and said they hope the `` limited release of documents is a sign of more cooperation to come . ''\nThe documents were released under pressure after whistle-blowers testified on the Hill and some email excerpts leaked to the media last week .\nThe documents showed the White House , along with several other departments , played a role in editing the so-called `` talking points , '' despite claims from the White House that it was barely involved . And they showed then-CIA Director David Petraeus objected to the watered-down version that would ultimately be used as the basis for U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice 's flawed comments on several TV shows the Sunday after the attack .\n`` Frankly , I 'd just as soon not use this , '' Petraeus told his deputy in a Sept. 15 email .\nThe 100-page file showed that State Department officials were even more heavily involved in editing the `` talking points '' than was previously known .\nOne email sent the Friday night after the attack from an unknown official said : `` The State Department had major reservations with much or most of the document .
