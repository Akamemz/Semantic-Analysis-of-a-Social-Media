As a candidate , Trump called for a `` total and complete shutdown '' of Muslim immigration to the United States , and Justice Department lawyers have gone to great lengths to avoid calling it a `` travel ban '' in court , referring to it as a `` temporary pause '' or simply `` the executive order . ''\nIn a string of tweets , Trump reiterated comments he made in light of the London terror attacks that the travel ban was necessary .\n`` People , the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want , but I am calling it what we need and what it is , a TRAVEL BAN , '' he tweeted at 6:25 a.m .
