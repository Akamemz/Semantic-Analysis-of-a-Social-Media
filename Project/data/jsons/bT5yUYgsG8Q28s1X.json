    "content": "In this hunt for voters , however , Mr. Kaine sees an edge , if only a small one . He was Mr. Obama \u2019 s handpicked Democratic National Committee chairman , and he has made no real effort to distance himself from the president . Last weekend , he stood side by side with Mr. Obama as the president barnstormed Virginia .\nStill , Mr. Kaine portrays himself as a bipartisan problem solver in the mold of Virginia \u2019 s other senator , Mark Warner , another Democrat who courted both parties while serving as governor . Mr. Kaine has tried to appeal to swing voters in the Washington suburbs , including moderate Republicans , with his record on transportation issues in the region . And his time as a moderate mayor of Richmond could still appeal to some Republicans there .\nHis language is carefully chosen . At a roundtable discussion in Bristol , hard on the Tennessee border , Mr. Kaine told attendees from both parties : \u201c I \u2019 ll make this promise to you : If I \u2019 m elected , I will be a partner with the president , whoever it is . \u201d\nMr. Allen , by contrast , has made Mr. Obama \u2014 and Mr. Kaine \u2019 s close connection to him \u2014 Issue No . 1 . In recent advertisements , including one first shown last week , Mr. Allen has sought a bipartisan sheen , but his record has a harder edge than his opponent \u2019 s , including his famous pledge at the 1994 state Republican convention to knock Virginia Democrats \u2019 \u201c soft teeth down their whiny throats . \u201d\nAsked whether she could envision someone who would vote for Mr. Romney and also for Mr. Kaine , Nancy Steele , a Republican bed-and-breakfast manager who attended Mr. Kaine \u2019 s Bristol meeting , paused and then said no . Asked if she could see an Obama-Allen voter , she laughed and said , \u201c Never ! \u201d\nBut Mr. Kaine said he thought he could appeal to those who vote for Mr. Romney .\n\u201c There will be thousands of Romney-Kaine voters , \u201d Mr. Kaine said over a milkshake in Bristol . \u201c Whether it will be 2,000 or 50,000 , I don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nKaine campaign aides say the mother lode of Romney-Kaine voters is not in the less populated country roads of southwestern Virginia but in the suburbs of Washington and Richmond . There , some voters may see Mr. Kaine and Mr. Romney as pro-business technocrats \u2014 and Mr. Allen and Mr. Obama as partisan flag carriers for their parties .\nBut Mr. Kaine is searching for them across this diverse state . The trip to Bristol last week was his third . He has also been to the conservative southwestern towns of Castlewood , Wise and Blacksburg , and he is planning another trip this month , to a health clinic at the Wise County Fairgrounds .\nNo one expects the Democrat to win this area , but he can not afford to be blown out .\n\u201c There \u2019 s some tough real estate in this state , \u201d Mr. Kaine said , \u201c and this is some tough real estate . \u201d\nThe Allen campaign believes that Mr. Kaine is facing a rout in coal country , where many white working-class voters are suspicious of Mr. Obama \u2019 s intentions for coal . To distance himself from the president , Mr. Kaine would have to offer vocal opposition of the sort that Senator Joe Manchin , Democrat of West Virginia , displayed in an advertisement that showed him firing a rifle at an Obama energy bill , said Chris LaCivita , a longtime Virginia Republican campaign adviser . But that will not happen .\n\u201c Politics and campaigns aren \u2019 t waged in a vacuum , and Tim Kaine has two years as chairman of the D.N.C. , where he was the coal killer \u2019 s biggest cheerleader , \u201d Mr. LaCivita said .\nMr. Kaine \u2019 s approach is to mix his pitch for bipartisanship with localized boasts about his record as governor , a record that he hopes will differentiate him from the president . A key to that record is the looming Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center , a state-of-the-art 585-megawatt coal-fired power plant on the outskirts of St. Paul that started commercial operations on Thursday .\nMr. Kaine mentions the plant virtually everywhere he goes as an antidote to efforts to link him to Obama administration policies that have been tough on coal . He does not pander . In Bristol on Friday , he said that human activity was warming the planet , and that the country needed to transition to cleaner sources of energy .
