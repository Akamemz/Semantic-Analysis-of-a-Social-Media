So he then went to Congress because he fears current practices are jeopardizing the war on terror and the bureau \u2019 s counterintelligence operations .\n\u201c Who gets what surveillance teams \u2014 it \u2019 s now all about bias and favoritism and the good ol \u2019 boy system , \u201d the whistleblower said in an interview with The Times , speaking only on condition of anonymity because his identity is supposed to remain secret during surveillance . \u201c My division \u2014 although we had the statistics to prove we needed more personnel \u2014 got skipped over because executive management had an ax to grind . \u201d\nFBI officials readily acknowledge a handful of top managers \u2019 children or relatives landed jobs on the surveillance teams , but they insist the hirings were governed by the bureau \u2019 s strongly worded policy that outlaws favoritism in hiring .\n\u201c All applicants go through a rigorous selection process , including structured interviews and security background investigations , \u201d the bureau said . \u201c Personnel matters that have the potential of being viewed as an act of nepotism are subject to appropriate administrative action . \u201d\nThe FBI also confirmed that some offices that scored high for surveillance needs were skipped over in favor of lower-ranked offices .\nOfficials said that while the matrix evaluation was carefully conducted , it also allowed for some discretion by managers to change rankings .\n\u201c Due to limited resources , not all field offices that qualified for an additional surveillance team were provided one . Both the selection process and the final determinations were subjected to an extensive review process and approved by executive management , \u201d the bureau said in its statement to The Times .\nThe whistleblower disclosures come at a sensitive time for the bureau , which still faces questions as to why it had not more aggressively tracked the Tsarnaev brothers , who are suspected in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing , after Russian authorities had tipped the agency about the pair .\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican , said his office is examining the whistleblower \u2019 s concerns , particularly on how the FBI initially handled the accusations and their employee when he came forward .\n\u201c Whenever an employee comes forward like this with concerns about waste and mismanagement , the Bureau should be grateful that it has someone willing to step up and point out problems , \u201d Mr. Grassley said in a statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c But too often , the whistleblower gets punished for doing the right thing . \u201d\nThe whistleblower \u2019 s personnel file shows that , for most of the last two decades , he received high ratings and frequent praise for his surveillance work , including numerous awards and commendations as well as personal letters of gratitude directly from FBI directors when he worked in the Washington , D.C. , area . He received a rating of \u201c excellent \u201d in 2013 in his new division .\nBut after he questioned management in 2014 as to why his division was passed over for a new surveillance team it had earned in the rankings , the whistleblower was given a first-ever negative evaluation .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been retaliated against just for asking a fair question , \u201d he told The Times .\nThe surveillance units \u2014 often known as \u201c G-teams \u201d \u2014 consist of covert tracking specialists who do not have the rank of special agents , and they are funded through the black budget since they work on counterterrorism and counterintelligence .\nTheir exact whereabouts and numbers are generally kept secret from the public \u2014 as are the identities of the team members . But a nonclassified memo obtained by The Times indicated there are 54 field offices spread across the country , with about eight people on an average team , and many cities qualify for multiple teams .\nCongress gets regular reports on the program because of its sensitive work and the possibility that surveillance of Americans could violate privacy rights . Reports of activities are prepared about every six months , but Congress at any time can request the information , and has been doing so more as terrorist jihad groups grow overseas .\nBut some team members , including the whistleblower , expressed concerns that Congress was being kept in the dark about surveillance staffing decisions and hirings that aren \u2019 t being made on merits .\nOne email shows a supervisor directly dismissed the whistleblower \u2019 s concerns that Congress should be notified .\n\u201c The Senate has much more important work to do than worry about which offices received assets , \u201d Scott Brunner , a former FBI assistant special agent in charge , wrote in an April 2014 email to the whistleblower .\nMr. Brunner has since left the division , becoming the legal attache for the FBI \u2019 s Bogota , Colombia , office . He did not return phone calls seeking comment .\nThe whistleblower related a story about how his division superiors wanted to promote an older FBI employee to the surveillance team because his appearance and skills matched the job , but they were turned down by Washington . They also were rejected for an additional team after scoring high on the list of offices in need of surveillance expansion .\nThe whistleblower said he was told the reason for both rejections was office politics , essentially bad blood between a supervisor in his division and the surveillance brass in Washington .\nThe whistleblower \u2019 s account is echoed in an email from a senior official in Washington who handled the surveillance program scoring system .\nThe email says his effort to alert his bosses that resources may not be properly delegated was altered by Washington bureaucrats . \u201c They changed my white paper , the degree to which I don \u2019 t know , \u201d the Washington supervisor wrote in 2014 .\nHe noted that the unit leadership held \u201c disdain \u201d for the whistleblower \u2019 s office that affected decisions . And some surveillance team members across the country were disturbed that the unit boss \u201c has so much power \u201d and \u201c exercises most of it with little oversight , if any , from superiors , \u201d he wrote in the email .\nOther \u201c G-team \u201d leaders voiced similar frustrations in interviews or contemporaneous documents . FBI offices with just one team would like to either have a staff member added to handle their administrative work or be paid more to do the extra workload themselves .\nAfter voicing these complaints , another team member in a Midwestern division was told by Washington brass that an additional team may happen if the complaints stopped . He responded he couldn \u2019 t be bought . Statistically , that division didn \u2019 t qualify for another team on a needs basis , but it did want an added coordinator , according to interviews .\nThe FBI now investigates an average of more than six new terrorist threats per day , according to the most recent statistics , which were compiled back in 2004 , and the G-teams often find themselves as part of some of the FBI \u2019 s biggest cases . The teams started operations in the 1970s in New York City as a pilot program using their spycraft to help track and monitor potential Soviet threats .\nOne of their greatest successes was helping to discover Robert Hanssen , a former FBI official who spied for the Soviet Union for 20 years , all the while working for U.S. intelligence .\nShortly after their pilot program , the G-teams went national . The organization has grown from a few employees into a sprawling bureaucracy .\nGrowth of those units has created an opportunity , however , for some of the FBI \u2019 s top management to place adult children into the surveillance teams as a way of getting them on a fast track to becoming an agent .\nAccording to documents and interviews , there have been at least three paternal hirings in recent years within the FBI \u2019 s special surveillance group . Two of those operatives advanced to become FBI special agents , and the third remains on a G-team .\nIn addition , a fourth nepotism case has been alleged involving a resident agency that , alongside the local G-team , reports to the Little Rock , Arkansas , FBI office . That person later landed a plum job in the Washington office of FBI Director James B. Comey .\nG-team members told The Times they did not oppose hiring agents \u2019 relatives if they were qualified and willing to learn the craft of surveillance , but many seemed to just be passing through as ticket punchers , and one had serious skill deficiencies .\nFor example , a G-team member hired in the late- \u2018 90s was the son of a well-known FBI legal attache and special agent in charge in Europe .\nThe son was retained by the FBI even though he failed his map-reading test six times before being placed on a surveillance team , according to a source inside the bureau who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation . Usually one failure would be enough to remove an operative from the elite program , insiders say , because map reading is a necessary skill within the espionage world .\nEventually , the agent \u2019 s son was promoted to a supervisory special agent in New York City , records show .\nIn another case , a G-team operative hired last year was the child of an assistant unit chief in the surveillance program . The candidate got to choose which office he wanted to work in \u2014 a rarity in the surveillance unit , which sends personnel where surveillance is most needed . He chose an office where his father had good friends and therefore would receive good treatment , according to interviews .\nA third G-team member , hired a few years ago , was the daughter of a high-ranking and decorated FBI official key to the bureau \u2019 s languages program , and was a highly decorated agent . The woman has now risen to become an agent herself in the Washington , D.C. , area .\nSeparately from the G-teams , in a resident agency that reports to Little Rock , Arkansas , a position within the FBI was held for the offspring of an agency supervisor until the child graduated from college . The woman ended up graduating from school a semester late , but the division held the position open until she could graduate .\nThe student \u2019 s job was to report directly to her father , so the FBI , not wanting to set off alarm bells , hired another supervisor so she could report to a nonrelative .\nLater , when the father was transferred to a legal attache office overseas , the daughter was given a plum position in Washington , D.C. , working in the FBI director \u2019 s office \u2014 just a year after graduating from college .\nThe Times chose not to name any of the three G-team operatives or the FBI hire to avoid compromising their current or past undercover surveillance work or alerting terrorists to their identity .\nGovernment watchdogs say the surveillance team members and the public have reason to be concerned about the hiring pattern .\n\u201c When hiring decisions are based on who you know rather than what you know , the federal government isn \u2019 t operating to its fullest potential , \u201d said Scott Amey , the general counsel at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight . \u201c We don \u2019 t like cozy relationships and sweetheart deals when it comes to contractors or grantees , and the same holds true for pulling strings to benefit family and friends . \u201d\nThe Justice Department , which oversees the bureau , has been plagued with nepotism charges over the past decade .\nA DOJ inspector general report released last month found the head of the International Crime Police Organization , another law enforcement agency , used his position to secure a job for his son and other relatives .\nAnd a November investigation discovered certain offices in the DOJ had a \u201c pervasive culture of nepotism and favoritism , \u201d making it at least the fifth inspector general report since 2004 to find hiring problems at the agency .\nIn response to the repeated nepotism charges , Justice said it would strengthen its hiring training for employees , especially regarding the agency \u2019 s nepotism rules .\n\u201c There is no room for nepotism in the federal government \u2019 s hiring practices , \u201d Rep. Bob Goodlatte , Virginia Republican and House Judiciary Committee chairman , said recently . \u201c Those hired to serve taxpayers must earn \u2014 not be given \u2014 the job . \u201d",
