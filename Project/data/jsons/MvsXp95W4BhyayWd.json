Joe Manchin of West Virginia , Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri , all of whom are up for reelection in 2018 , are flirting with bids for governor next year instead . If they follow through and win , Democrats fear they \u2019 ll open up seats that could favor the GOP . And if they lose , their chance for reelection to the Senate could plunge too .\nA McCaskill spokesman said the two-term senator is deciding which office would give her the greatest platform to deliver for Missourians , as well as how it might affect her family . Heitkamp \u2019 s office won \u2019 t address the gubernatorial rumors , but wary North Dakota Republicans are considering a plan to tinker with the state \u2019 s Senate vacancy law . Manchin has said that if the partisan fever in Washington doesn \u2019 t break soon , he \u2019 ll consider running for governor again .\nAll three have had gubernatorial ambitions for years : Manchin was elected to two terms as West Virginia \u2019 s governor before choosing to run in a 2010 special election to replace longtime Sen. Robert Byrd after Byrd \u2019 s death . Heitkamp was defeated in the 2000 governor \u2019 s race by Republican John Hoeven , with whom she now serves in the Senate . McCaskill lost narrowly to Matt Blunt in the 2004 gubernatorial contest and now serves alongside Blunt \u2019 s father , GOP Sen. Roy Blunt .\nThe three senators will weigh gubernatorial bids in 2016 against staying in the Senate and facing voters in the 2018 midterms . The past two midterms were disastrous for Democrats , though a new president in 2017 and an improving economy could scramble that dynamic . Still , the loss of up to three proven candidates \u2014 who represent states increasingly hostile to Democrats \u2014 would be , at minimum , a setback for the party .\n\u201c It \u2019 s definitely a little bit disconcerting that folks like this who can get reelected in red states may be thinking about running for governor instead , \u201d said Jim Manley , a former adviser to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . \u201c They \u2019 ve shown an ability to win in states that are pretty tough for Democrats right now . \u201d\nAny decision to return to state politics may have been nudged further by Democrats \u2019 miserable showing in November \u2019 s midterm elections . The party lost all seven seats it held in states Mitt Romney won in 2012 \u2014 with longtime Democratic incumbents resoundingly rejected in red states like Arkansas and Louisiana \u2014 and the party \u2019 s prospects in West Virginia , Kentucky and Georgia were easily defeated .\nDemocrats need to win at least four seats \u2014 perhaps five \u2014 to retake the Senate next year , an achievable-but-difficult prospect based on the number of Republicans up for reelection in blue states . But if Manchin , Heitkamp and McCaskill depart , Democrats may need to run up a higher margin to protect their majority beyond 2016 .\n\u201c The magic number becomes that much higher if you \u2019 re going to look ahead , \u201d said Brian Walsh , a Republican strategist and former communications director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee .\nUnder current state laws , if they run and win , each would have the opportunity to appoint a Senate replacement until the next election . The three Democrats could also lose , rendering them damaged goods if they try to run for reelection to the Senate .\nFor the senators themselves , the allure of the world \u2019 s greatest deliberative body may have waned . They \u2019 re facing at least two years in the minority of a chamber already wracked by gridlock and partisanship . The most exciting policymaking in the nation has been at the state level , and the thought of executive control may have more appeal than lawmaking .\n\u201c For Claire , this is a tough decision that will ultimately come down to two things \u2014 where can she make the biggest impact on behalf of Missourians , and how her decision will impact her family , \u201d said McCaskill spokesman John LaBombard .\nCaitlin Legacki , a former McCaskill aide who is now a principal at the Democratic consulting firm Precision Strategies , says her former boss would \u2019 ve rejected a gubernatorial bid by now if it weren \u2019 t a serious consideration .\n\u201c If Claire wasn \u2019 t at all interested , she would have ruled it out by now . She \u2019 s a pretty direct person , \u201d said Legacki , who was McCaskill \u2019 s communications director on her successful 2012 reelection campaign and worked with the Missouri Democratic Party . \u201c I think if she did run , she \u2019 d immediately be the best candidate in the race . \u201d\nAttorney General Chris Koster has also been considering a run to succeed Gov .
