She has slipped a rung or two down the economic ladder from the soccer moms of the more prosperous 1990s , as indicated by her new nickname \u2014 waitress mom . Rather than ferrying children around the suburbs in minivans , she is spinning in the hamster wheel of a tight economy and not getting ahead .\nThe intense competition for the female vote was underscored Wednesday as both presidential campaigns seized on a remark by Richard E. Mourdock , the Republican Senate candidate in Indiana , in a Tuesday night debate that pregnancy is \u201c something that God intended to happen \u201d even if it is the result of rape .\nMr. Romney , who had just made an ad for Mr. Mourdock , quickly distanced himself from the statement , while the Obama campaign just as quickly suggested that it reflected the backward thinking of Republicans and said that if elected , they would pose a danger to women \u2019 s health .\nThe quadrennial obsession with winning over female voters can sometimes lead to mythmaking . Pollsters now question the validity of soccer moms as a distinct voting bloc ; the term came into vogue in the 1996 presidential election but vanished soon after , to be replaced by the equally dubious post-9/11 \u201c security moms . \u201d\nWhether or not the term \u201c waitress moms \u201d endures , it defines a distinct demographic : blue-collar white women who did not attend college . And they are getting a lot of attention from both campaigns as the presidential race barrels toward its conclusion because even at this late date , pollsters say , many waitress moms have not settled on a candidate . They feel no loyalty to one party or the other , though they tend to side with Republicans .\n\u201c Blue-collar women are most likely to be the remaining movable part of the electorate , which is precisely why both campaigns are going at them as hard as they are , \u201d said Geoff Garin , a Democratic pollster , who is advising Priorities USA , a pro-Obama \u201c super PAC . \u201d\nAbout 9 percent of all voters in 2008 were white women without college degrees who had an annual household income of less than $ 50,000 , according to exit polls .\nSo when the candidates talk about women , which they do a lot these days , the waitress moms are top of mind . Mr. Obama , for example , is now discussing abortion and birth control not as a matter of controlling one \u2019 s own body but as \u201c a pocketbook issue for women and families , \u201d as he said in the recent town-hall-style debate , noting that many women rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptives but for referrals and screenings .\nA recent Romney ad featured a young woman telling her newborn : \u201c Dear Daughter .
