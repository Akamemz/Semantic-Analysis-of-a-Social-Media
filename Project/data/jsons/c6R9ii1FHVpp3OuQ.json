It Likely Wo n't\nWhen Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , a Republican from Iowa , announced a hearing for next Monday to air a decades-old sexual-assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , it did n't end the debate over how the Senate should handle the charges .\nDemocrats are calling for a full FBI investigation of the allegation before a hearing , saying Monday is too soon .\n`` I 'd have the professionals go in there , seek corroborating evidence , talk to the people involved , certainly talk to the third person who they claimed was there , and that has n't been done , '' Democratic Sen.

The Justice Department seems to agree . In a statement , a Justice Department spokeswoman said the FBI \u2014 which has added a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to Kavanaugh 's already completed background report file \u2014 had already done all it was going to do , because `` the allegation does not involve any potential federal crime . ''\n`` The FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation , '' the statement reads . `` The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States . The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime . The FBI 's role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers . ''\nGrassley was more definitive in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Tuesday morning .\n`` The FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh is closed , '' he said . `` The FBI is not doing any further investigation . ''\nBlasey Ford has accused Kavanaugh of a sexual attack when they were both in high school . She sent a letter to her congresswoman , Rep. Anna Eshoo , in July , which made its way to Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat from California and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee . Blasey Ford asked for confidentiality , and the allegation was not made public \u2014 until this past weekend .\nThat 's when she came forward for the first time publicly in an interview with The Washington Post . She detailed her memories of the incident , saying that Kavanaugh pulled her into a bedroom along with another boy , then allegedly groped her , trying to remove her clothing , and put his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams .\nKavanaugh responded through the White House with a categorical denial .\n`` This is a completely false allegation , '' he said . `` I have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2014 to her or to anyone . Because this never happened , I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday . I am willing to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation , from 36 years ago , and defend my integrity . ''\nHe will do that in a scheduled hearing Monday , in what Democrats worry will be a replay of another he-said , she-said exercise in 1991 when Anita Hill came forward with sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas .\nDemocrats complained that there was not a thorough FBI investigation of the allegations that took place , and no major witnesses other than Hill and Thomas who were called . Monday 's planned hearing seems to be following a similar pattern .\nGrassley told Hewitt Tuesday that , `` Yes , '' there will only be two witnesses Monday . `` We 've got two people involved , '' Grassley said , `` and two people ought to be able to present their stories and then we 'll have to be the jury . ''\nGrassley added , `` Accusers deserve to be heard and , after they 're heard and we also have a responsibility to hear Judge Kavanaugh , and I want to hear from Dr. Ford , and she deserves to be heard , because these are serious accusations . ''\nGrassley said it is n't even 100 percent certain at this point whether Ford or Kavanaugh will testify first , though he is inclined to have Ford go first .\nOn Morning Edition Tuesday , Leahy suggested that another man who was allegedly in the room at the time of the encounter be called before the committee .\nThere were other potential witnesses who came forward before the Hill-Thomas hearings , and then-Chairman Joe Biden declined to let them testify , something he now has said publicly he regrets .\nDemocrats argue that other witnesses could provide context and verify or refute parts of the stories that either person tells .

' ``\nGrassley told Hewitt that he has not heard from Blasey Ford yet , saying the committee has reached out to her .\n`` We still have n't heard from Dr. Ford , so do they want to have the hearing or not ? '' Grassley said .\nBlasey Ford 's attorneys told NPR 's Morning Edition and other outlets that Ford is willing to testify .\nGrassley told Hewitt he hoped the hearing would n't devolve into a circuslike atmosphere .
