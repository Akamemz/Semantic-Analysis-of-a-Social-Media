    "content": "A California group has launched a ballot initiative to eliminate sanctuary cities , hoping to take power away from state and local lawmakers who have banned their police and sheriff \u2019 s deputies from cooperating with federal deportation authorities .\nTheir ballot drive got a boost Tuesday when San Francisco \u2019 s \u201c sanctuary sheriff \u201d lost his re-election bid , defeated in large part because of his handling of the release earlier this year of an illegal immigrant who now stands accused of killing a woman walking on the city waterfront with her father .\n\u201c This should be a warning sign to elected officials in other sanctuary cities that the majority are opposed to their refusing to cooperate with federal authorities , \u201d said Ted Hilton , the man behind the new ballot initiative .\nSheriff Ross Mirkarimi became just the third San Francisco sheriff to lose a reelection after he refused to rescind his gag order preventing his deputies from talking with federal immigration authorities .\nHis loss reverberated back in Washington , D.C. , where Sen. Ted Cruz took to the Senate floor to try to force passage of his bill imposing mandatory federal minimum sentences on illegal immigrants who are deported but try to sneak back into the U.S. That bill is known as \u201c Kate \u2019 s Law , \u201d named after Kathryn Steinle , the woman authorities say was killed by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez after he was released under the sheriff \u2019 s policy .\n\u201c This ought to be a clear choice : With whom do you stand ? Do you stand with violent criminal illegal aliens , or do you stand with American citizens ? \u201d Mr. Cruz said .\nSEE ALSO : Ted Cruz illegal immigration crackdown blocked by Harry Reid\nBut Minority Leader Harry Reid blocked the Texan \u2019 s efforts , saying mandatory sentences would be too expensive , forcing the government to build 20,000 new prison beds . Mr. Reid also doubted criminal penalties would stop potential illegal immigrants from making the trip .\nDemocrats have rallied around sanctuary cities , saying they should have the right to refuse to cooperate with federal agents when it comes to who gets deported . Democrats argue that having local police cooperate frightens even legal immigrants , who then balk at calling the police to report serious crimes \u2014 leaving communities less safe .\nBut that hasn \u2019 t stopped the issue from becoming a political hot potato .\nGOP presidential hopeful Donald Trump helped elevate sanctuary cities to a national debate in the wake of Steinle \u2019 s killing , calling it proof of his claim that Mexico sends some of its most dangerous citizens to the U.S .\nThe issue has also been heated in California , where there have been several high-profile killings attributed to illegal immigrants protected by sanctuary policies . The state legislature and Gov . Jerry Brown last year enacted the Trust Act , which limited the types of cooperation local police and sheriffs could have with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents .\nSheriff Mirkarimi \u2019 s policy went even further than the Trust Act , however , imposing a virtual ban on communications .\nMr. Hilton \u2019 s ballot initiative would effectively overturn the Trust Act , requiring police to notify federal authorities every time they encounter an illegal immigrant . Federal agents could still refuse to deport them , but the state would have done its part .\nState and local authorities would also be required to comply with federal agents \u2019 requests to be notified when an immigrant wanted by ICE is to be released , and to honor \u201c detainer \u201d requests asking that immigrants be held for pickup .\nMr. Hilton said he crafted the initiative based on parts of an Arizona law already upheld by the Supreme Court and on legislation pending in the U.S. House and Senate , so he said it \u2019 s a solid proposal .\nThe initiative is in the comment period , and then he \u2019 ll have five months next year to gather the more than 360,000 signatures needed to earn a place on the ballot . Because of double-signers and invalid signatures , he \u2019 ll probably need to get more than 500,000 signatures just to be safe .\n\u201c The issue has come to the forefront . I was trying to do it in 2012 \u2014 timing wasn \u2019 t right , I was ahead of my time . Now it \u2019 s got the attention it deserved , \u201d he said .\nPolling earlier this fall from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California , Berkeley found both Republicans and Democrats opposed sanctuary city policies at rates topping 70 percent .\n\u201c We found very broad-based opposition to the idea of sanctuary cities , \u201d said IGS Director Jack Citrin , a professor of political science at UC-Berkeley who has studied immigration for years . \u201c Californians want their local officials to abide by the requests of federal authorities . \u201d\nNew polling this week by Rasmussen Reports also found support nationally , with 62 percent of voters saying the federal Department of Justice should take legal action to try to stop sanctuary cities . And 56 percent of voters said they supported Kate \u2019 s Law , with the mandatory five-year minimum sentence for repeat illegal immigrants .\nThere \u2019 s always been a deep disconnect , however , between elected officials and voters on immigration , and sanctuary cities may be an example of that . Just two weeks before Sheriff Mirkarimi was ousted by voters , the San Francisco City Council approved a nonbinding resolution backing his sanctuary policy in full .\nJessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies , said that disconnect is one reason why Californians are turning to the ballot initiative process , which goes around elected officials and enlists voters to make law directly .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the ultimate expressions of frustration that the elected officials are not listening to the voters , \u201d Ms. Vaughan said . \u201c They feel that they have to go through this process to accomplish change because their elected officials aren \u2019 t listening to them .
