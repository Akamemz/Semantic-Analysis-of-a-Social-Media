Thanks for you thinking that the talk is \u201c pretty great \u201d . I appreaciate your white male validation . I see that it isn \u2019 t interesting enough for you to actually take your ass to the talk . 2. Who said it was ok for you to say futbol ? It \u2019 s Latino Heritage Month , your telling people not to come to the talk , but want to use our language ? Trick NO ! White students appropriating the Spanish language , dropping it in when convenient , never ok. Keep my heritage language out your mouth ! If I \u2019 m not allowed to speak it , if my dad \u2019 s not allowed to speak it , then bitch you definitely are not supposed to be speaking it . Especially in this context .\nShe also published the email that he sent to the white student :\nYour not latino , call it soccer . You don \u2019 t play futbol . Futbol is played with people ( LATINO ) who know how to engage in community soccer , as somebody who grew up on the cancha ( soccer field ) I know what playing futbol is , and the way you take up space , steal the ball , don \u2019 t pass , is far from how my culture plays ball . I \u2019 m not playing intramural once again this semester because you and your cis-dude , non passing the ball , stealing the ball from beginners , spanish-mocking , white cohort has ruined it ( for the second time ) . Unless I find another team you won \u2019 t be seeing me . I don \u2019 t care if this email is over the top or mean . So complain to whatever white friends you want about it . You \u2019 re never going to know what its like to not be able to your own heritage sport comfortably because of your gender/race/ethnicity .\nAnd she quoted the white student \u2019 s reply , which emphasizes the white student \u2019 s own sense of grievance :\n... I \u2019 m sorry that I detracted from your event . Do you really think people who were going to go to the talk changed their mind because of my email ? I don \u2019 t think so , and that was not my aim at all - I wanted to give those people who had been looking forward to playing soccer on Thursday a chance to do that . You do not get to define who I am . Fuck off . Clearly you only see me at face value and yes I \u2019 m white and male , what do you want me to do about that ?
