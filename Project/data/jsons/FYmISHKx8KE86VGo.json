    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland , who is respected across political lines , to the Supreme Court Wednesday , in an epic power play targeting the resolve of Republicans who have vowed to block any replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia until a new president takes office .\nGOP leaders , caught in the undertow of an election in which the conservative grass-roots are already in revolt , immediately renewed their refusal to consider Garland , 63 , saying their reservations were not personal but motivated by a desire for the American people to weigh in on Scalia 's replacement . The showdown is even more fraught than most Supreme Court fights , since Obama 's choice could tilt the ideological balance of the court away from conservatives -- possibly for years .\nIn a speech in the evocative ceremonial surroundings of the White House Rose Garden , Obama praised Garland as `` one of America 's sharpest legal minds , '' making a case that he was so eminently qualified for the job in terms of legal learning , experience and temperament that any attempt to ignore his appointment could only be the result of base political motivations .\n`` I have selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America 's sharpest legal minds , but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency modesty , integrity , evenhandedness and excellence , '' Obama said . These qualities and his long commitment to public service have earned him the respect and admiration from leaders from both sides of the aisle . ''\nSenate Republicans do not plan to vet or have hearings on Garland , let alone a vote on his nomination . Obama and Democrats argue that with 10 months left in his term , there is plenty of time for the Senate to take up and confirm a new justice . The gravity of Obama 's announcement on Wednesday was part of an attempt to pressure Republicans , especially senators with an eye on their own legacies or those who face tough re-election fights , to peel away from their leadership .\nJUST WATCHED Mitch McConnell responds to Supreme Court nomination Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mitch McConnell responds to Supreme Court nomination 01:16\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the GOP chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Chuck Grassley of Iowa , have both expressed little leeway in their determination to forgo hearings for Obama 's nominee .\n`` The American people may well elect a president who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration , '' McConnell said Wednesday . `` The next president may also nominate someone very different . Either way , our view is this : Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy . ''\n`` Rather than put Judge Garland through more unnecessary political routines orchestrated by the White House , the leader decided it would be more considerate of the nominee 's time to speak with him today by phone , '' McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said . `` And since the Senate will not be acting on this nomination , he would not be holding a perfunctory meeting , but he wished Judge Garland well .

Some believed Obama would time his pick so it would n't get lost in a news cycle dominated by election results . But the timing seems suited to directly insert the selection into the political conversation .\nFueling the argument is the potential for the first shift in the court 's ideological leaning in two decades . If confirmed , Obama 's nominee will likely offer a vastly different legal outlook that Scalia , who was considered one of the court 's most conservative members .\nCNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the pick of Garland , who is well-respected in legal circles `` takes the issue of qualifications off the table , '' but noted the fight now is all about politics . ''\n`` He is the chief judge of the second most important court in the country , but the political calculation here is , I think , quite clear , '' Toobin said . `` President Obama is saying to the Senate Republicans , you can take my 63-year-old now or wait for President Hillary Clinton to bring up a 45-year-old in 10 months . ''\nAt 63 , Garland is much older than the other contenders on the short list such as Judges Sri Srinivasan , Paul Watford and Jane Kelly .
