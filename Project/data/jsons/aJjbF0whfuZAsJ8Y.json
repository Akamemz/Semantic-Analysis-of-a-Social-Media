The most high-profile skeptic was left-leaning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , who wondered on Twitter whether the Trump administration had \u201c gotten to \u201d the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) , which produces the jobs report .

Donald Trump himself said the unemployment rate was \u201c phony \u201d when he was campaigning for president , and that the real number was much higher .
