    "content": "President Trump , already the most media-accessible president in memory , is talking to journalists almost nonstop as his successes pile up ahead of the midterm elections .\nMr. Trump opened an Oval Office meeting to the press in late morning to accept the resignation of Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations . Such a high-profile departure ordinarily wouldn \u2019 t be a positive for the White House , but the president and Mrs. Haley made clear that the separation was friendly . They took questions from journalists for 20 minutes on a variety of subjects .\n\u201c Anything else ? \u201d the president asked when reporters seemed to be running out of questions .\n\u201c In my experience covering White Houses , from Reagan to George W. Bush , we \u2019 ve never had that kind of access from a president before , \u201d said Richard Benedetto , a retired White House correspondent who teaches at American University . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t get credit for being so accessible . He answers questions all over the place . \u201d\nImpromptu give-and-take sessions with the press are rare for most presidents . But Mr. Trump prides himself on being an unconventional president .\nHis meeting with Mrs. Haley ended around 11 a.m. , and he was just getting started .\nAs Mr. Trump departed the White House for a campaign rally in Iowa on Tuesday afternoon , he stopped on the South Lawn to take more questions from reporters , as he often does . Over the roar of Marine One \u2019 s engines , Mr. Trump took another 37 questions in about 15 minutes , including some regarding Mrs. Haley \u2019 s possible replacement and his relationship with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein .\nTold that a writer for New York magazine was interviewing White House aides for an article on the job status of Chief of Staff John F. Kelly , Mr. Trump granted the writer , Olivia Nuzzi , an impromptu personal press conference in the Oval Office with Mr. Kelly , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence .\nAboard Air Force One later on the flight to Iowa , Mr. Trump invited the press \u201c pool \u201d of reporters to his cabin for an off-the-record discussion for 33 minutes . These invitations from presidents in the past were extremely rare , but Mr. Trump has held at least two in-flight sessions with reporters in his airborne office this year .\nThe White House agreed to put some of the president \u2019 s answers on the record , on topics including China , North Korea and U.S. ethanol policy .\nOn Wednesday , during a briefing on Hurricane Michael , the president kept reporters in the Oval Office for another 23 minutes . \u201c He \u2019 s on a roll , \u201d observed one veteran White House journalist .\nAlthough Mr. Trump has been more available to the media than other presidents since the start of his term , he has been engaging with the press even more frequently in recent weeks . He has had many positive developments to discuss , including historically low unemployment rates , a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada , and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh .\nAt the same time , the White House is holding fewer press briefings .\n\u201c The president is always the best spokesperson for his administration , \u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Any time the American people get to hear directly from him , it is a good thing . \u201d\nOne TV correspondent who covers the White House sees \u201c a conscious strategy here to be more available . \u201d\n\u201c The White House knows that all of his comments drive news cycles , so the more you can step up the metabolism of the news cycle , the better it is for him , \u201d said the reporter , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . \u201c Also , I think he loves the attention . He has strongly held opinions , and he needs to tell people about them . \u201d\nThen there are the campaign rallies , where Mr. Trump takes his case directly to supporters . He is holding as many as four rallies per week this month and is speaking for more than an hour at locations such as Johnson City , Tennessee , and Council Bluffs , Iowa .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s departures on Marine One from the South Lawn have become a staple of his dealings with the press , and he controls the interactions completely . If the president is hit with unpleasant news such as the Russia investigation , then he can simply walk straight to the helicopter and avoid questions . If he has positive news to discuss , such as the Kavanaugh confirmation or strong economic numbers , then he can approach the assembled media .\nAnd he can walk away to his noisy chopper whenever he wants .\n\u201c It \u2019 s all him , \u201d the TV reporter said . \u201c The format is the ultimate home-court advantage . All the network reporters are lined up behind a chain begging for his attention , and he can pick and choose who he favors and who he doesn \u2019 t favor . He loves it , and it works for him . \u201d\nMr. Benedetto said the media shouldn \u2019 t complain about the dwindling number of press briefings by Mrs. Sanders , given the unprecedented level of direct presidential access .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re a reporter , you want to know what the president is thinking every day , \u201d Mr. Benedetto said . \u201c You don \u2019 t often get that from the daily briefing . When you get the words directly from the president on a daily basis on every issue that comes along , that should be paradise for a reporter who is covering the White House . It matters not whether you like where he stands or don \u2019 t like where he stands . The fact is , we want to know where he stands . And that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re getting . \u201d\nWhite House aides also augment the president \u2019 s weekly agenda with a variety of so-called background briefings with reporters , usually on conference calls .

That was Biden being a stalking horse .
