Will Tallman (R), who is retiring at the end of the year, sent a memo to his colleagues in the state House last Friday seeking support for what he has dubbed the \u201cTeacher Code of Ethics.\u201d\n\nAccording to the memo, the bill would prohibit public elementary or secondary schoolteachers, while operating within the scope of their employment, from endorsing, supporting, or opposing any the following:\n\n- Candidate or nominee for public office or any local, state, or federal official, regardless of whether such official is elected or appointed;\n\n- Local, state, or federal legislation or regulation, regardless of whether such legislation or regulation is pending, proposed, or enacted;\n\n- Local, state, or federal court case or judicial action, regardless of whether such court case or judicial action is pending, proposed, or decided;\n\n- Pending, proposed, or final executive action by any local, state or federal executive branch agency;\n\n- Activities that hamper or impede the lawful access of military recruiters to school property;\n\n- Activities that hamper or impede the actions of a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency;\n\n- Introduce into class any controversial subject matter that is not germane to the topic of the course being taught; or\n\n- Advocate for any issue that is part of a political party platform at the national, state, or local Level.\n\n\u201cOur K-12 school teachers should not be using their classroom time spent on political or ideological indoctrination,\u201d Tallman said in his memo. \u201cDoing so takes time away from instruction in the academic foundation subjects of mathematics, science, English, history, and civics, and prevents our students from receiving a high-quality public education for careers in the global, high-tech economy.\u201d\n\nReaction to Tallman's bill has been mixed.\n\nSome people said this would help remove potential bias from the classroom and help students make up their own minds.\n\nI agree with it, teachers aren\u2019t supposed to push there personal agenda on kids let the kids make up their own mind. \u2014 David (@deerhunterinGA) September 20, 2018\n\nPennsylvania Rep Proposes Bill To Ban Political Talks In Schools https://t.co/XTOlvnmggM Great idea!
