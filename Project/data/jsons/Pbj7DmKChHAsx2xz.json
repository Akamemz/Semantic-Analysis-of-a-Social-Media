Scott Walker of Wisconsin , a Republican . \u201c I still think people are undecided , they are still listening . \u201d\nObama loyalists are wondering whether the campaign organization , with its focus on the mechanics of getting its voters to the polls , was built to withstand late decisions by voters to give Mr. Romney another look . The president flew to New Hampshire on Saturday \u2014 the last day to register to vote by mail \u2014 to protect the state \u2019 s four electoral votes in hopes of avoiding a narrow loss or an Electoral College tie .\nThe biggest fear for Mr. Obama \u2019 s team is that a large number of voters suddenly will get so fed up with the back-and-forth of the campaign , the economic outlook and the partisan rancor that they break for Mr. Romney , if only to try something new in Washington .\nThe biggest fear for Mr. Romney \u2019 s campaign is that he is coasting on a wave of enthusiasm rather than building upon it . Or in the words of one top campaign adviser : \u201c Did we peak too soon ? \u201d\nMr. Obama now has a solid lead in states that account for 185 electoral votes , and he is well positioned in states representing 58 more , for a total of 243 , according to a ranking of states by The New York Times , based on polls and interviews with strategists in both campaigns .\nMr. Romney has solid leads in states with 180 electoral votes and is well positioned in states with 26 more , according to the Times rating , for a total of 206 . It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency .\nIn the closing days of the race , seven states representing 89 electoral votes \u2014 Colorado , Florida , Iowa , New Hampshire , Ohio , Virginia and Wisconsin \u2014 are now considered tossups . Here is a look at their dynamics and the potential path for each candidate .\nMr. Romney \u2019 s swing through Florida on Saturday \u2014 the first day of in-person early voting there \u2014 included a visit to a Republican county in the Panhandle where he wants to pump up his vote count ( Escambia ) and where a huge crowd met him with chants of \u201c 10 more days , \u201d a Democratic county where he wants to cut into Mr. Obama \u2019 s expected lead ( Osceola ) , and a swing county ( Pasco ) .\nMr. Romney can not afford to leave any base untouched . If he loses Florida , his chances of winning the presidency depend on sweeping nine other states , including Ohio and Nevada .\nFlorida has been considered challenging territory for Mr. Obama all year . Even when polls have shown him ahead , both campaigns have expressed skepticism that the edge would hold .\nBut at Mr. Obama \u2019 s headquarters in Chicago , his aides said in interviews last week that they believed they had at least a 50 percent shot in Florida , based on mail-in ballots , voter registrations and polling . A new wave of Puerto Rican voters in Central Florida is highly influential , Democrats say , along with younger Cuban-Americans in South Florida .\nRepublicans , still bullish about victory , say Mr. Obama \u2019 s aides are overestimating his support among Puerto Ricans . And , they said , Mr. Romney can rely on a very strong showing in Polk County , a Republican stronghold , and push for an edge in the swing county of Hillsborough as well as in Volusia County , home to Daytona .\nOn Mr. Obama \u2019 s trip on Saturday to Nashua , N.H. , with the singer James Taylor in tow , he wooed a state that revels in its reputation for unpredictability . In a stop at a union hall , he said , \u201c We don \u2019 t know how this thing is going to play out . \u201d\nMr. Obama won every county there in 2008 , a feat that even Bill Clinton did not pull off in 1992 and 1996 . But Mr. Obama \u2019 s sometimes comfortable lead in polls has dwindled .\nMr. Romney \u2019 s aides have been somewhat optimistic about his chances in the state . He was the governor in Massachusetts next door , and he vacations there . His lakeside home in Wolfeboro is in Carroll County , which he will need to win .\nHe and his campaign have plied the state \u2019 s two traditionally Republican-leaning counties in southern New Hampshire \u2014 Rockingham and Hillsborough \u2014 with attention since he announced his run for the presidency ( in the Rockingham town of Stratham ) . His assertions that Mr. Obama has allowed the budget deficit and national debt to get out of control speaks to the state \u2019 s long tradition of thrift .\nNew Hampshire has only four Electoral College votes . But they would make all the difference if Mr. Romney also wins Florida , North Carolina , Virginia and Ohio and Mr. Obama takes Nevada , Colorado , Iowa and Wisconsin .\nThe state has extra resonance for Democrats : if Al Gore had won there , he would have been president .\nThere is a potential outcome that has tantalized political addicts everywhere : that Colorado will become the new Florida , the state that decides it all .\nFor it to come to that , Mr. Romney must win four of the most competitive states \u2014 New Hampshire , Virginia , Florida and Wisconsin \u2014 leaving Mr. Obama with Ohio and Iowa . That would give Mr. Romney 262 Electoral College votes to Mr. Obama \u2019 s 267 , leaving both in need of Colorado \u2019 s 9 . In 2008 , Mr. Obama became the first Democrat to win the state in 16 years by stealing the counties north and south of Boulder \u2014 Jefferson and Larimer \u2014 and Arapahoe County near Denver and by shaving down the Republican margin in conservative areas like Colorado Springs .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .
