    "content": "If you ask President Donald Trump , he isn \u2019 t racist . To the contrary , he \u2019 s repeatedly said that he \u2019 s \u201c the least racist person that you \u2019 ve ever encountered . \u201d\nOn the campaign trail , Trump repeatedly made explicitly racist and otherwise bigoted remarks , from calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists to proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the US to suggesting a judge should recuse himself from a case solely because of the judge \u2019 s Mexican heritage .\nThe trend has continued into his presidency . From stereotyping a black reporter to pandering to white supremacists after they held a violent rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , to cracking a joke about the Trail of Tears , Trump hasn \u2019 t stopped with the racist acts after his 2016 election .\nMost recently , Trump tweeted that several black and brown members of Congress are \u201c from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe \u201d and that they should \u201c go back \u201d to those countries . The tweets , aimed at Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , Ayanna Pressley ( D-MA ) , Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) , and Rashida Tlaib ( D-MI ) , exemplify a common racist trope used against immigrants and minority groups who criticize US policies . Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , condemned Trump \u2019 s tweets as racist .\nSo interesting to see \u201c Progressive \u201d Democrat Congresswomen , who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe , the worst , most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world ( if they even have a functioning government at all ) , now loudly ...... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 14 , 2019\n.... and viciously telling the people of the United States , the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth , how our government is to be run . Why don \u2019 t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came . Then come back and show us how .... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 14 , 2019\n.... it is done . These places need your help badly , you can \u2019 t leave fast enough . I \u2019 m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 14 , 2019\nThis is nothing new for Trump . In fact , the very first time that Trump appeared in the pages of the New York Times , back in the 1970s , was when the US Department of Justice sued him for racial discrimination . Since then , he has repeatedly appeared in newspaper pages across the world as he inspired more similar controversies .\nThis long history is important . It would be one thing if Trump simply misspoke one or two times . But when you take all of Trump \u2019 s actions and comments together , a clear pattern emerges \u2014 one that suggests that bigotry is not just political opportunism on Trump \u2019 s part but a real element of Trump \u2019 s personality , character , and career .\nHere \u2019 s a breakdown of Trump \u2019 s history , taken largely from Dara Lind \u2019 s list for \u2588\u2588\u2588 and an op-ed by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times :\nFor many people , none of these incidents , individually , may be totally damning : One of these alone might suggest that Trump is simply a bad speaker and perhaps racially insensitive ( \u201c politically incorrect , \u201d as he would put it ) , but not overtly racist .\nBut when you put all these events together , a clear pattern emerges . At the very least , Trump has a history of playing into people \u2019 s racism to bolster himself \u2014 and that likely says something about him too .\nAnd of course , there \u2019 s everything that \u2019 s happened through and since his presidential campaign .\nAs a candidate and president , Trump has made many more racist comments\nOn top of all that history , Trump has repeatedly made racist \u2014 often explicitly so \u2014 remarks on the campaign trail and as president :\nThis list is not comprehensive , instead relying on some of the major examples since Trump announced his candidacy . But once again , there \u2019 s a pattern of racism and bigotry here that suggests Trump isn \u2019 t just misspeaking ; it is who he is .\nAre Trump \u2019 s actions and comments \u201c racist \u201d ? Or are they \u201c bigoted \u201d ?\nOne of the common defenses for Trump is that he \u2019 s not necessarily racist , because the Muslim and Mexican people he often targets don \u2019 t actually comprise a race .\nDisgraced journalist Mark Halperin , for example , said as much when Trump argued Judge Curiel should recuse himself from the Trump University case because of his Mexican heritage , making the astute observation that \u201c Mexico isn \u2019 t a race . \u201d\nKristof made a similar point in the New York Times : \u201c My view is that \u2018 racist \u2019 can be a loaded word , a conversation stopper more than a clarifier , and that we should be careful not to use it simply as an epithet . Moreover , Muslims and Latinos can be of any race , so some of those statements technically reflect not so much racism as bigotry . It \u2019 s also true that with any single statement , it is possible that Trump misspoke or was misconstrued . \u201d\nFor one , the argument is tremendously semantic . It \u2019 s essentially probing the question : Is Trump racist or is he bigoted ? But who cares ? Neither is a trait that anyone should want in a president \u2014 and either label essentially communicates the same criticism .\nAnother issue is that race is socially malleable . Over the years , Americans considered Germans , Greeks , Irish , Italians , and Spaniards as nonwhite people of different races . That \u2019 s changed . Similarly , some Americans today consider Latinos and , to a lesser degree , some people with Muslim and Jewish backgrounds as part of a nonwhite race too . ( As a Latino man , I certainly consider myself to be of a different race , and the treatment I \u2019 ve received in the course of my life validates that . ) So under current definitions , comments against these groups are , indeed , racist .\nThis is all possible because , as Jen\u00e9e Desmond-Harris explained for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , race is entirely a social construct with no biological basis . This doesn \u2019 t mean race and people \u2019 s views of race don \u2019 t have real effects on many people \u2014 of course they do \u2014 but it means that people \u2019 s definitions of race can change over time .\nBut really , whatever you want to call it , Trump has made racist and bigoted comments in the past . That much should be clear in the long lists above .\nRegardless of how one labels it , Trump \u2019 s racism or bigotry was a big part of his campaign \u2014 by giving a candidate to the many white Americans who harbor racial resentment .\nOne paper , published in January 2017 by political scientists Brian Schaffner , Matthew MacWilliams , and Tatishe Nteta , found that voters \u2019 measures of sexism and racism correlated much more closely with support for Trump than economic dissatisfaction after controlling for factors like partisanship and political ideology .\nAnother study , conducted by researchers Brenda Major , Alison Blodorn , and Gregory Major Blascovich shortly before the 2016 election , found that if people who strongly identified as white were told that nonwhite groups will outnumber white people in 2042 , they became more likely to support Trump .\nAnd a study , published in November 2017 by researchers Matthew Luttig , Christopher Federico , and Howard Lavine , found that Trump supporters were much more likely to change their views on housing policy based on race . In this study , respondents were randomly assigned \u201c a subtle image of either a black or a white man. \u201d Then , they were asked about views on housing policy .\nThe researchers found that Trump supporters were much more likely to be impacted by the image of a black man . After the exposure , they were not only less supportive of housing assistance programs , but they also expressed higher levels of anger that some people receive government assistance , and they were more likely to say that individuals who receive assistance are to blame for their situation .\nIn contrast , favorability toward Hillary Clinton did not significantly change respondents \u2019 views on any of these issues when primed with racial cues .\n\u201c These findings indicate that responses to the racial cue varied as a function of feelings about Donald Trump \u2014 but not feelings about Hillary Clinton \u2014 during the 2016 presidential election , \u201d the researchers concluded .\nThere is also a lot of other research showing that people \u2019 s racial attitudes can change their views on politics and policy , as my colleague Dylan Matthews as well as researchers Sean McElwee and Jason McDaniel previously explained for \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nSimply put , racial attitudes were a big driver behind Trump \u2019 s election \u2014 just as they long have been for general beliefs about politics and policy . ( Much more on all the research in my explainer . )\nMeanwhile , white supremacist groups have openly embraced Trump . As Sarah Posner and David Neiwert reported at Mother Jones , what the media largely treated as gaffes \u2014 Trump retweeting white nationalists , Trump describing Mexican immigrants as \u201c rapists \u201d and criminals \u2014 were to white supremacists real signals approving of their racist causes . One white supremacist wrote , \u201c Our Glorious Leader and ULTIMATE SAVIOR has gone full-wink-wink-wink to his most aggressive supporters . \u201d\nSome of them even argued that Trump has softened the greater public to their racist messaging . \u201c The success of the Trump campaign just proves that our views resonate with millions , \u201d said Rachel Pendergraft , a national organizer for the Knights Party , which succeeded David Duke \u2019 s Knights of the Ku Klux Klan . \u201c They may not be ready for the Ku Klux Klan yet , but as anti-white hatred escalates , they will . \u201d\nAnd at the 2017 white supremacist protest in Charlottesville , David Duke , the former KKK grand wizard , said that the rally was meant \u201c to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump . \u201d\nSo while Trump may deny his racism and bigotry , at some level his supporters seem to get it .
