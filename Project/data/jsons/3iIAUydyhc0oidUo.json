''\nPlanned Parenthood has been a target on the campaign trail after a series of sting videos was released alleging the organization illegally profits from selling aborted fetal tissue . Carson , a famed neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate , has been a vocal opponent of the group . He was also in the news this week after reports surfaced that he once used aborted fetal tissue for research .\nOn Fox News Wednesday , Carson was asked about Democrats ' criticism that Republicans who want to defund Planned Parenthood are waging a `` war on women . '' He responded :\n`` Maybe I am not objective when it comes to Planned Parenthood , but , you know , I know who Margaret Sanger is , and I know that she believed in eugenics , and that she was not particularly enamored with black people . `` And one of the reasons you find most of their clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find a way to control that population . I think people should go back and read about Margaret Sanger who founded this place \u2014 a woman Hillary Clinton by the way says that she admires . Look and see what many people in Nazi Germany thought about her .

'' Alencia Johnson , assistant director of constituency communications , told NPR :\n`` Does he think that black women are somehow less capable of making the deeply personal decision about whether to end a pregnancy than other women ? ...
