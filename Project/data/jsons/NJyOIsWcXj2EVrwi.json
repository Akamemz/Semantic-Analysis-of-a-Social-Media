Obama on climate: 10 takeaways\n\nPresident Barack Obama outlined a wide-ranging climate plan Tuesday that\u2019s centered on greenhouse gas regulations for power plants \u2014 while making a surprise mention of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and defending his increasingly embattled nominee for EPA administrator.\n\n\u201cThe question now is whether we will have the courage to act before it is too late,\u201d Obama said in a lengthy speech at Georgetown University that formally introduced his second-term climate agenda. \u201cAnd how we answer will have a profound impact on the world we leave behind not just to you but to your children and your grandchildren. As a president, as a father and as an American, I am here to say we need to act.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the speech and Obama\u2019s climate plan:\n\n( WATCH: Obama's full speech on climate change)\n\n1. Obama dropped a Keystone bombshell\n\nDespite expectations that the president would steer clear of mentioning Keystone \u2014 and the fact that the White House plan never mentions the project \u2014 Obama announced that he would support building the pipeline only if it won\u2019t \u201csignificantly\u201d increase greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nObama didn\u2019t say if he thinks Keystone can meet that standard, although a draft State Department study issued in March called the project\u2019s environmental impact negligible.\n\n\u201cOur national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe net effects of the pipeline\u2019s impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward.\u201d\n\nIn its draft study in March, the State Department downplayed worries that Keystone would inspire a huge, carbon-spewing increase in oil production from Canada\u2019s tar sands region \u2014 arguing that Canadians will tap that supply \u201cwith or without the proposed project,\u201d and that the crude could be exported by rail. Greens disagree, saying the pipeline is critical to whether Canada has any incentive to ramp up production.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of the pipeline issued statements during the speech calling Obama\u2019s words favorable for their side.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama urges action on climate change)\n\n2. The president went to bat for McCarthy\n\nObama reserved special praise for Gina McCarthy, his nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency. McCarthy\u2019s nomination was already being held up by Senate Republicans\u2019 complaints that the agency is secretive, and Obama\u2019s climate push has prompted some top GOP lawmakers to warn that she faces even more trouble.\n\n\u201cThe Senate should confirm her without any further obstruction or delay,\u201d Obama said, noting that McCarthy, who currently heads the EPA\u2019s air office, has worked for past Republican governors.\n\nAnd he took a few shots at Republicans who question climate science.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSticking your head in the sand might make you feel safer, but it\u2019s not going to protect you from the coming storm.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Coal industry no fan of President Obama plan)\n\n3. Obama is done waiting for Congress\n\nObama tried to get a cap-and-trade bill through Congress during his first term, and in this year\u2019s State of the Union address he gave lawmakers one final ultimatum.\n\n\u201cIf Congress won\u2019t act soon to protect future generations, I will,\u201d he said in the February speech. \u201cI will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\u201d\n\nBut even at the time, the universal expectation was that Congress had zero chance of passing any serious climate legislation.

The plan won\u2019t target all parts of the economy\n\nThe days when it seemed possible to impose an economywide cap on greenhouse gas emissions are long gone. Instead, the president is taking a piecemeal approach that focuses on one sector of the economy at a time.\n\nIn his first term, he tackled transportation, which accounts for about 30 percent of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas output, by imposing tough standards to reduce vehicles\u2019 emissions and increase fuel economy.",
