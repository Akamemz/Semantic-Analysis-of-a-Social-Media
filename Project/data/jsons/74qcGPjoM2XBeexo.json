His decision leaves just one other candidate of color , Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , a Samoan American , in the Democratic contest . It brings the number of Democrats in the presidential primary race to eight .\nPatrick launched his bid for president in mid-November but failed to register in polling and fundraising and never made it onto a presidential debate stage . Patrick raised just $ 2.2 million in the final six weeks of last year , and while a super PAC created to support his bid committed nearly that much to advertising in the early primary states last month , Patrick still barely registered in New Hampshire . He blamed in part what he characterized as a media narrative created around his late entry in the race . \u201c I \u2019 ve met many people on the campaign trail who lament how they wished I had entered the race sooner , \u201d he said in a statement .\n\u201c We can not keep mistaking media narratives for political outcomes . Political outcomes are entirely up to voters , \u201d he said .\nIt \u2019 s a disappointing finish for someone who , in part because of his rhetorical skills , has long drawn comparisons to former President Barack Obama . The two men are personally close and Patrick counts some of Obama \u2019 s aides and donors as part of his own inner circle . Valerie Jarrett , one of Obama \u2019 s closest advisers , was one of Patrick \u2019 s most prominent supporters .\nBut Obama has largely avoided wading into the race , and Patrick said throughout the primary that he didn \u2019 t expect the former president to provide a boost to his bid .\nPatrick hoped that by focusing on New Hampshire , the familiarity of a neighboring state would help boost his chances in the race . He offered what aides felt was a unique message in a field that ultimately boiled down largely to career politicians with little executive or private sector experience : that he had the track record as governor and through years of business experience to deliver on Democratic priorities like fighting climate change and reforming health care .\nBut another New England Democrat , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , won the state .
