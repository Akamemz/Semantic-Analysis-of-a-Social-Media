Polls throughout the week showed clear majorities of Americans supporting at least `` a pause '' in the resettlement of refugees from the region being roiled by the self-proclaimed Islamic State .\nFor all that America prides itself on being `` a nation of immigrants '' symbolized by the Statue of Liberty with her lamp beside a golden door , the U.S. is also a nation of people \u2014 subject to human insecurity and fears for safety heightened over the past decade .\nWithin 48 hours of the attack , Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder had called for a pause in refugee re-settlements . The Republican 's state is home to a significant Muslim population and might have been a logical destination for many new arrivals . Within a day , a majority of the nation 's governors had joined Snyder or gone even further . In Tennessee , a GOP legislative leader called for Syrians already resettled in Nashville to be rounded up and turned over to federal authorities .\nOn Thursday , the U.S. House voted overwhelmingly to suspend the resettlement of Syrian and Iraqi refugees until each and every one could be certified as safe by the heads of the FBI , the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security .\n`` From a law enforcement perspective , the bill presents us with an impracticality , '' Attorney General Loretta Lynch said . And FBI Director James Comey , one of the three officials charged with certifying the refugees as safe , noted , `` It would be very , very difficult to say of anyone coming into the country that there is zero risk . ''\nDespite the big bipartisan majority vote , perhaps no one expects this House bill to become law . It will be altered in the Senate , and it has drawn a veto threat from the White House . Nonetheless , it had to happen \u2014 if only to defuse the explosive atmosphere of anxiety even on Capitol Hill in the wake of the horrors in Paris . All these politicians were giving voice to the powerful popular impression \u2014 visible in much of the media \u2014 that lax policies and porous borders could expose Americans to the same sort of violence visited on the French .\nProsecutors said Friday they determined that two of the suicide bombers at France 's national stadium had passed through Greece last month . Greece is a common European entry point for many refugees because of its proximity to Syria . It scarcely seems to matter , however , that the core of the Paris problem is that principal players were European nationals \u2014 or that the supposed mastermind was radicalized in a French prison .\nThis is not , of course , the first time Americans have confronted a sudden influx of refugees . And it is not the first time the impulse has been to raise the drawbridge :\n2010 \u2014 Haitians : The earthquake in Haiti in 2010 increased the already strong incentives for Haitians to attempt the hazardous seaborne transit to the U.S. , whether legally or illegally . Given the new devastation in the island nation , the U.S. relaxed its usual policy of deportation for undocumented Haitians already in the U.S. illegally , granting them Temporary Protected Status . Similar status had been granted to arrivals of other Latin American countries after earthquakes and hurricanes . But the idea of accepting new Haitian immigration because of this disaster was strongly resisted both in Florida and beyond .\n1980 \u2014 Cubans : In the summer of 1980 , an economic crisis in Cuba led the Communist regime of Fidel Castro to allow thousands of Cubans to leave the country . Over the course of months , perhaps 125,000 Cubans made the trip from Cuba to the U.S. in a massive , but haphazard , flotilla known as the `` Mariel boatlift . '' Public opinion was positive at first , but soured at reports that Castro had salted the exodus with an admixture of inmates from prisons and hospitals . Partly as a result , relocation was slowed while the `` Marielitos '' arrivals were vetted and processed at military reservations in Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Puerto Rico and Arkansas , as well as South Florida . In Arkansas , there were riots at the camp and escapes . The political fallout caused the defeat that fall of the state 's young first-term Democratic governor , Bill Clinton .\n1975 \u2014 Vietnamese : The fall of Saigon sent hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese fleeing from the triumphant new Communist regime . Some had the means to travel , while others were forced onto flimsy vessels that were barely seaworthy . They came to be known as `` boat people . '' Many had the U.S. as their ultimate destination , and a young Democratic Gov . Jerry Brown of California resisted their relocation . He even tried to prevent planeloads of refugees from landing in his state at Travis Air Force Base . Brown eventually relented , and Vietnamese have assimilated successfully in California and elsewhere since . Returning to the governorship in 2011 , Brown has been a vocal supporter of accepting Syrian refugees .\nMid-1950s \u2014 Post-WWII Europeans , including Jews who survived the Holocaust : When the Soviet Union was tightening its grip on Eastern Europe through proxy governments run by the Communist Party , President Dwight D. Eisenhower released a plan to bring a quarter-of-a-million asylum-seekers to the U.S . But the end of World War II in 1945 sent waves of refugees in multiple directions . Here again , the popular reaction was resistance . A Gallup poll in 1946 found 59 percent of Americans disapproved of a plan to accept those displaced by the war \u2014 including Jews , who had survived the Holocaust . President Harry Truman directed that 40,000 refugees be admitted in December of that year , a number that barely registered against the magnitude of human movement at the time .\nLate 1930s \u2014 European Jews before the Holocaust : Those seeking political asylum from the rise of Nazism in central Europe often wanted to come to the U.S. , and some with the necessary means or connections managed to do so . Still , others were turned away . A Fortune magazine poll in 1938 found 67 percent opposed to allowing `` German , Austrian and other political refugees '' to come to the U.S. That same year , a troubled President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened a 29-nation conference to discuss the Jewish refugees in particular , who were fleeing Hitler 's rise .\nAs one account put it , `` If each nation [ present ] had agreed on that day to take in 17,000 Jews at once , every Jew in the [ German ] Reich could have been saved .
