    "content": "Some outlandish rumors about COVID-19 , the disease caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 , still persist , and continue to percolate on the internet : To some , it \u2019 s a dastardly bioweapon designed to wreak economic armageddon on the West ; a left-wing conspiracy to damage the reelection prospects of President Trump ; a virus that leaked from a Wuhan laboratory .\nSuch paranoid speculation is at the very least unhelpful , health professionals say , and only serves to politicize a global public-health emergency and distract from potentially life-saving measures to contain and/or slow the spread of coronavirus . After reportedly jumping from animals to humans at a food market in Wuhan , China in early December or before .\n\u201c Conspiracy theories politicize a public-health emergency and distract from potentially life-saving measures . \u201d\nAs the world struggles to come to terms with the prospect of COVID-19 changing the way we socialize and work , people are left wondering whether the financial markets have had a massive overreaction to yet another virus that will eventually fizzle out , or whether it \u2019 s time to buckle down and heed warnings of the disease \u2019 s seriousness issued by governments and health authorities .\nHere , \u2588\u2588\u2588 breaks down the facts and fiction of the global pandemic :\nAirborne transmission is \u201c plausible , \u201d according to a study published in the print edition in the peer-reviewed The New England Journal of Medicine this week from scientists at Princeton University , UCLA and the National Institutes of Health . The researchers concluded that the virus could remain airborne for \u201c up to 3 hours post aerosolization . \u201d\nThe scientists found that SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes the new disease COVID-19 , was detectable in the air for up to three hours , up to four hours on copper , up to 24 hours on cardboard , and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel . For those reasons , officials recommend washing hands , cleaning surfaces and \u201c social distancing \u201d in public spaces .\nIt \u2019 s recommended that you remain at least six feet apart from other people , especially indoors , experts say . \u201c Studies have looked at how far spit and little droplets fly , and that \u2019 s the magic number , \u201d said Luis Ostrosky , vice chairman of internal medicine at McGovern Medical School in Houston .\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : \u2018 They \u2019 ve likened it to a war where the number of casualties just keep on coming \u2019 : Italians find solidarity , resilience and music during the coronavirus lockdown\nWill you be OK if you are young and healthy ?\n\u201c The COVID-19 virus is capable of causing infection and severe disease in all people of all ages , \u201d said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove , head of WHO \u2019 s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit . \u201c The data that we \u2019 ve seen from a number of countries is that the majority of children that are infected are experiencing mild disease , \u201d she said , adding that there has been a handful of childhood fatalities .\nWhile there \u2019 s no question that the elderly and those with underlying conditions have been affected much more than other age group , younger people are not immune : 20 % of deaths in Korea were people under the age of 60 , and 15 % of people in intensive care units in Italy were under 50 years of age , said Dr. Michael Ryan , WHO \u2019 s top emergencies expert .\nIn New York state , where 50 % of the U.S. cases are located , Gov . Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat , said last week that roughly half of hospitalized coronavirus patients were between 18 and 49 . Among the latest fatalities : A 36-year-old public school principal from New York City \u2014 where there were more than 38,000 cases of coronavirus as of Tuesday morning .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not certain how long the virus that causes Coronavirus survives on surfaces , but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses , \u201d the World Health Organization said . \u201c Studies suggest that coronaviruses \u2014 including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus \u2014 may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days . \u201d\nHigher temperatures , based on earlier coronaviruses , are likely to degrade it . But experts caution that \u2014 as spring arrives in the Northern Hemisphere , which usually marks the end of the traditional flu season \u2014 this novel coronavirus may not necessarily go away in warmer weather . It is from a different family of viruses than the flu , and it is highly contagious .\nIts life span will also vary , depending on the type of surface , temperature and/or humidity . Bathrooms are a welcoming environment for coronaviruses . \u201c Previous coronaviruses can remain viable in cold , moist surfaces up to nine days , \u201d Ostrosky said . So if you are sharing a home with someone who has coronavirus , he strongly advises against sharing the same bathroom .\nPresident Trump speaks in an address to the nation from the Oval Office at the White House on Wednesday . He announced a suspension in travel from Europe to the U.S. Associated Press\nIn-flight oxygen is probably of higher quality than the air in your home . \u201c If you have an infected person in the front of the plane , and you \u2019 re in the back of the plane , your risk is close to zero simply because the area of exposure is thought to be roughly six feet from the infected person , \u201d according to Charles Chiu , professor of laboratory medicine at University of California , San Francisco .\n\u201c Ventilation rates provide a total change of air 20 to 30 times per hour , \u201d the WHO says . \u201c Most modern aircraft have recirculation systems , which recycle up to 50 % of cabin air . The recirculated air is usually passed through HEPA ( high-efficiency particulate air ) filters , of the type used in hospital operating theatres and intensive care units , which trap dust particles , bacteria , fungi and viruses . \u201d\nPresident Trump last week said he was \u201c marshaling the full power of the federal government \u201d by suspending travel for non-U.S. citizens from Europe to the U.S. for 30 days , later extending it to the U.K. and Ireland , a measure aimed at stopping sick people spreading COVID-19 . \u201c We made a lifesaving move with early action on China . Now we must take the same action with Europe , \u201d he said .\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : \u2018 The lack of an all-island response has also rattled communities on both sides of the Irish border. \u2019 Pubs close due to coronavirus , government issues new strict rules for funerals\n\u201c Men do tend to be more affected than women and their symptoms are often more severe , \u201d Ostrosky said . \u201c Estrogen has a protective effect . When scientists block estrogen production in animals , they become more susceptible to coronaviruses and they get worse symptoms. \u201d He added , \u201c But please don \u2019 t take estrogen injections or pills . If you are a man , they will not help you . \u201d\nItaly had 119,827 confirmed cases , as of Saturday , and has had the worst nationwide outbreak after the U.S. ( 278,568 ases ) . In Italy , the average age of those who have died from COVID-19 in Italy is 80.3 years old , and only 25.8 % are women , according to Silvio Brusaferro , legal representative at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 . Italy also has the oldest population in Europe .\nIs there a gender difference when it comes to influenza ? \u201c No , with the flu it \u2019 s pretty even , \u201d Ostrosky said . The two illnesses have similar symptoms , including a sore throat and coughing . Coronavirus is a type of virus common in humans and animals , and causes mild-to-moderate respiratory illnesses . But in very severe cases it can travel through your body and damage other organs .\n\u2018 Most face masks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and don \u2019 t prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales , \u2019 the CDC says . \u2588\u2588\u2588 photo illustration/iStockphoto\nFace masks help prevent patients from spreading the virus , but they are not as effective as protecting the healthy , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says . On Friday , it recommended the use of cloth face masks , saying they were useful for preventing the wearer from passing on the virus if he/she was asymptomatic . It reversed that stance , citing \u201c new evidence . \u201d\nSome previous studies have concluded that face masks have helped reduce contagion by reducing droplets being sprayed into the air during flu season ; another Japanese-based study says this works when paired with vaccination , not an option in this case . it may be that they work in a small amount of cases and/or just wearing them helps to promote healthy behaviors .\nAlso see : \u2018 You can never make things perfectly safe with zero risk. \u2019 How can you choose between saving the U.S. economy and saving lives ?\nThis study says N95 medical-grade masks do help filter viruses that are larger than 0.1 micrometers ( One micrometer , um , is one millionth of a meter . ) The coronavirus is 0.125 um . \u201c These products can help block large droplets expelled by the wearer , but also have been shown to have efficacy at filtering smaller particles and are designed to fit tightly to the face , \u201d it said .\nFace masks are needed for health-care professionals . N95 masks are tighter-fitting than surgical masks and protect against small particles and large droplets , according to the CDC . Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that there are only 30 million N95 masks in the national stockpile , and \u201c as many as 300 million masks are needed in the U.S. for health-care workers . \u201d\nRecommended : How much exercise is OK during the coronavirus pandemic ? and in Paris , the French scramble to make sense of a chaotic situation \u2014 with paperwork\nNo . Seniors have a higher risk of getting severely sick and/or dying from COVID-19 . Italy has the oldest populations in Europe , and that \u2019 s one reason some observers say it \u2019 s had such a high fatality rate . Health professionals say people should remain at least six feet apart from other people because that \u2019 s roughly as far as the virus can travel in a cough , sneeze or when someone is talking .\nWhether you \u2019 re on a plane or a train , you are at risk of contracting coronavirus , especially if you are seated near an infected person and/or you touch a contaminated surface and then your face without properly washing your hands . However , WHO says there \u2019 s no difference between sitting in a restaurant , office or movie theater : If you \u2019 re near an infected person , you \u2019 re at risk .\nWhile you can \u2019 t do much about being seated next to an infected passenger on a plane at 30,000 feet , you can exercise responsible \u201c social distancing , \u201d Ostrosky said . \u201c The more people who are in that enclosed space with you , the higher the risk you have of being exposed to someone who is sick , \u201d he added . \u201c If we had to rank them , there is an increased risk in larger groups . \u201d\n\u201c The average person should not worry about their clothing , \u201d Sarah Fortune , a professor and chair of the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email . \u201c If you are a health-care provider and potentially subject to a high density of virus , the answer is different . But for most of us , it is all about our hands and face . \u201d\n\u201c Coronaviruses in general last a lot longer on a solid , nonporous surface compared to porous fabrics , \u201d Juan Dumois , a pediatric infectious-diseases physician at Johns Hopkins All Children \u2019 s Hospital in St. Petersburg , Fla. , said . He suggested they would survive better on \u201c artificial fibers \u201d such as polyester than on cotton .\nNot technically . Last month , WHO has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic . An outbreak is deemed to have become a pandemic when it has spread among humans on several continents , while an epidemic is a disease that infects regions or a community over a large geographical area . \u201c We \u2019 re deeply concerned , \u201d WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters last month .\nBut wasn \u2019 t coronavirus already a pandemic , given that it had reached approximately 130 countries by that time ? Not quite . There \u2019 s subjectivity involved in designating an epidemic a pandemic , and epidemiologists finally agreed that the efforts to contain the virus had failed . In other words , it \u2019 s now a matter of containing the spread and slowing it down to give scientists time to work on a vaccine .\nCoronavirus had killed at least 7,163 people in the U.S. as of Saturday , 1,867 of which were in New York City , according to Johns Hopkins University . New York State has 102,870 confirmed cases , roughly 37 % of the U.S. total ; the U.S. accounts for 24 % of the global total . Worldwide , there were 1,140,327 confirmed cases of the virus and 60,887 reported deaths ; 233,930 have recovered .",
