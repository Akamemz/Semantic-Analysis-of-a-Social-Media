    "content": "These days , the news is full of sensational stories of violent campus mobs shutting down conservative speakers and freaked-out college administrators treating rioters with kid gloves . Such stories offer excellent fodder for critics who are eager to condemn university culture . But I believe they distract from a deeper , subtler intellectual problem on the modern campus : the profound alienation of professors who don \u2019 t hold the mainstream political views and are treated as outsiders as a result .\nThis is the argument of an important book titled \u201c Passing on the Right : Conservative Professors in the Progressive University. \u201d Written by the political scientists Jon A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr. , it gives a glimpse into the lonely lives of ideological strangers on the modern campus . While conservatives represent America \u2019 s largest ideological group , at 36 percent of the population , they constitute less than 10 percent of faculty in the social sciences and humanities \u2014 and a small fraction of that at elite private schools . Many report feeling like oddballs who never quite fit in .\nGenerally , these professors fear they have little hope for advancement to leadership roles . Research backs up this fear , suggesting that intellectual conformity is still a key driver of personal success in academic communities . In a study published in 2012 in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , researchers asked students to evaluate candidates vying to represent them with the faculty . In some cases , the candidate identified him- or herself as a \u201c typical student at this college \u201d ; other subjects were given a candidate who was \u201c a relatively untypical student at this college. \u201d Even though both pledged to represent the students faithfully , in the same language , the untypical student consistently received significantly less support .\nSome might argue that it doesn \u2019 t matter \u2014 or is even a good thing \u2014 that conservatives on campus are marginalized . After all , there are many organizations in which philosophical differences are legitimately disqualifying . No one believes that there is anything strange about a Christian church seeking as clergy members only those who share the congregation \u2019 s faith and theology .
