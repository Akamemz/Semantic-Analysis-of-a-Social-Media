    "content": "Democrats are moving full force toward gun control as an election-year issue .\nThe Orlando nightclub massacre \u2013 the worst mass shooting in modern United States history \u2013 has galvanized Democrats in Congress . Just before their July 4 recess , they staged a 25-hour sit-in in the House and a talk-a-thon in the Senate to demand votes on gun legislation . They \u2019 re also targeting vulnerable Republican House and Senate seats on the issue .\nHillary Clinton , their likely standard bearer for president , is campaigning on gun-safety regulation . And the public overwhelmingly supports such measures as background checks at gun shows and preventing terrorists from buying guns .\n`` 2016 is shaping up to be the year of gun safety in the election , \u201d says Brina Milikowsky , chief strategy officer for Everytown For Gun Safety , the advocacy organization founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2014 . The group has endorsed Mrs. Clinton .\nBut will gun safety actually motivate voters ? Will it cause them to punish opponents of \u201c common sense \u201d regulation and reward supporters ?\nThat \u2019 s the key question , because America has seen versions of this story before \u2013 mass shootings , a presidential candidate for more gun regulation ( Barack Obama ) , and favorable public opinion . And yet it is the gun-rights lobby , spearheaded by the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) , which has had the upper hand in legislation at the state level and in Congress .\nStill , advocates of gun-safety regulation feel encouraged , with many saying the country is reaching a tipping point . They describe a slow boil of anger and fear about gun deaths \u2013 now combined with terrorism . They cite a frustrating disconnect between public opinion and a nonresponsive Congress .\n\u201c There comes a time when you have to say something , we have to make a little noise , when you have to move your feet . This is the time , \u201d said Rep. John Lewis ( D ) of Georgia , the veteran civil rights leader , during the House sit-in last month .\nWhat will make a difference this year is organization and momentum , says Ms. Milikowsky . Everytown can \u2019 t match the NRA in dollars , she says , but it has people power : mayors , moms , survivors , and other supportive Americans , a total of 50,000 volunteers who will be focusing on key state races , as well as advocating for Clinton .\nShe ticks through a list of successes at the state level in the last two years : the reelection of three governors who signed gun-control legislation \u2013 in Colorado , Connecticut , and New York ; the reelection of Colorado gun-control legislators after a recall ; the ouster of a couple of state senators in Oregon who had blocked expanded background checks .\nLast year , gun-control supporters , including Everytown , invested heavily in the Virginia state elections . They point to the state Senate victory of Jeremy McPike , a pro-gun-control Democrat whose district includes the NRA headquarters , and the tightening of another targeted race , although their candidate lost .\n\u201c My take on 2014 and the Virginia election in 2015 is that the gun issue , which was once considered a third rail , can be an issue to run on , even on NRA turf in Virginia , \u201d says Milikowsky .\nOn Friday , California Gov . Jerry Brown ( D ) signed a package of gun-control measures that , among other things , included expanding background checks to those purchasing ammunition , limiting the size of magazines and banning `` bullet buttons '' that allow shooters to more quickly change magazines , and making it more difficult to legally borrow a gun . However , Governor Brown vetoed five other gun-control bills , including one that would have made not reporting a stolen gun a crime .\nSince the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. , six states have expanded background checks to all gun sales , the most recent being Oregon and Washington , according to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence . Two citizen initiatives for universal background checks will be on the ballot in Nevada and Maine this fall .\n\u201c A larger , more gradual development that we \u2019 ve seen over the years is coming to fruition now , \u201d says Brendan Kelly , spokesman for the Brady center . \u201c This is really starting to matter for people , \u201d he says , citing the \u201c historic activism \u201d during last month \u2019 s Senate gun-control talk-a-thon , when 160,000 Americans called the Senate from every state , shutting down some senators \u2019 lines .\nWhile Mr. Kelly maintains that gun-regulation advocates are scoring wins on the state level , he acknowledges that Congress is a much tougher battle .\nIn June , eight Republicans backed a bipartisan Senate bill to prevent individuals on the no-fly list and a related list from buying firearms in a gun store . That \u2019 s twice the number of Republicans who backed a bipartisan bill to close the \u201c gun show loophole \u201d in the aftermath of Newtown . Neither bill , though , was able to advance despite majority support .\nMeanwhile , House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R ) of Wisconsin is expected to allow a vote on terrorist \u201c no fly , no buy \u201d legislation this week . But it \u2019 s similar to an NRA-backed Senate measure that Democrats reject .\nThe tricky thing for Democrats is not only the money and organizational prowess of the NRA , but that its backers are \u201c single-issue \u201d voters \u2013 that is , they turn out on Second Amendment rights alone .\n\u201c They \u2019 re politically active , they 're savvy , they understand the issues and they make the electoral connection to that , \u201d says Jennifer Baker , director of public affairs for the NRA . \u201c Draconian gun control at every level of government has really energized [ people ] to vote against Hillary Clinton and down the ballot . \u201d\nAt the same time , the NRA highlights its successes in states such as West Virginia , Idaho , Mississippi , and Missouri , where gun-control advocates invested against \u201c permitless carry \u201d laws , yet the NRA , by activating its members , won the day . Before the California measures were signed into law Friday , the NRA \u2019 s 2016 tally of state gun legislation signed or enacted into law showed the NRA leading 41 to 1 , compared to wins for the other side .\nIt can be argued that Virginia \u2019 s state election , too , produced little bang for the pro-gun-control buck . That side spent lots of money , but was unable to flip the narrowly controlled GOP state Senate , as hoped : The McPike win was for an open seat that had already been held by a Democrat .\n\u201c For the gun-rights people , I think it \u2019 s fear that their gun rights are going to be infringed upon in some massive way \u201d that sends them to the polls as reliable single-issue voters , says Kyle Kondik , political analyst and managing editor of Sabato \u2019 s Crystal Ball .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know what it would take for a big group of voters to come out and make decisions based on gun control , \u201d says Mr. Kondik . \u201c I \u2019 m not convinced it \u2019 s going to be a big driver in this election , \u201d he says , adding that presidential elections are defined by big-picture issues , such as the economy , and in this case , the traits of the candidates .\nIndeed , Gallup shows only 1 percent of Americans think gun control is the nation \u2019 s most important problem .\n\u201c Democrats haven \u2019 t been able to capitalize on a gun issue after tragedies in the past , and I don \u2019 t see why this year is any different , \u201d says David Wasserman , who tracks House races for the independent Cook Political Report .\nHis counterpart who follows Senate races says the issue is unlikely to affect vulnerable GOP senators in battleground states . `` I suspect that any voter who lists gun control as one of the three most important issues facing the country would n't have voted for these incumbents anyway , '' writes Jennifer Duffy in an email .\nStill , gun-control advocates remain undaunted , at least about prospects in the states .\nEverytown \u2019 s Milikowsky is especially encouraged by citizen initiatives to expand background checks .
