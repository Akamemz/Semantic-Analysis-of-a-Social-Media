    "content": "The House Judiciary Committee put the NSA \u2019 s phone-snooping program on the path to being scrapped Thursday when a bipartisan majority voted for major reforms to the Patriot Act .\nThe 25-2 vote signaled that Republicans and Democrats in the House won \u2019 t accept a full renewal of the Patriot Act , whose key data-collection powers are slated to expire at the end of May . That puts a dent in the hopes of Senate Republicans , including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who has argued the government needs the snooping powers to keep the country safe .\nOpposing Mr. McConnell is House Speaker John A. Boehner , who said Thursday he is backing the reform bill that cleared the Judiciary Committee and now heads to the full House floor for a vote .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not everything I want , but I think it \u2019 s a solid agreement , \u201d Mr. Boehner said .\nThe legislation would prevent the federal government from indiscriminately collecting and storing Americans \u2019 data , and would also impose more transparency on the secret court that oversees intelligence collection . In a move to gain support of some hawks , the bill also imposes raised prison sentences on those convicted of providing material support to terrorists .\nKnown as the USA Freedom Act , it was designed to rewrite the Patriot Act \u2019 s Section 215 , which authorizes the government to collect records from private businesses .\nThe most prominent use has been the National Security Agency \u2019 s program to scoop up and store five years \u2019 worth of records of the numbers , times and durations of phone calls made within the U.S . The NSA insists it only probes the records when it believes a number is associated with a terrorism investigation .\nBut the program , revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden , left many Americans uncomfortable , and efforts to rein in the collection have been going on for two years .\n\u201c The bill ends bulk collection . It ends secret laws . And it increases transparency of our intelligence community , \u201d said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. , Wisconsin Republican and the author of the original Patriot Act , who says he \u2019 s been stunned by the way the Bush and Obama administrations used it to justify collecting data on every American \u2019 s phone calls .\nIt \u2019 s very similar to a bill that passed the full House overwhelmingly last year , also with bipartisan support .\nAnother version foundered in the Senate , though , after Mr. McConnell led a filibuster to block it during a lame-duck session of Congress late last year . The Kentucky Republican argues that the government needs the powers to combat terrorist threats .\nLast week , Mr. McConnell introduced a bill that would extend the current Patriot Act Section 215 powers through the end of 2020 .\nSenate Democrats are generally opposed to Mr. McConnell \u2019 s bill , and even Senate Republicans are torn , with the more hawkish supporting it but civil libertarians , including presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , fiercely opposing it .\nMr. McConnell has only limited leverage in the debate since , without any action , Section 215 is slated to sunset as of June 1 . He could try to push for a short-term extension to keep the debate going , or for some lesser alternative than the full extension of all powers \u2014 but he has been keeping his strategy closed .\nThe issue appears to be trending away from Mr. McConnell . The biggest threat to the House bill came not from the hawks but from the other side , where Republicans and Democrats teamed up to try to further limit government searches under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
