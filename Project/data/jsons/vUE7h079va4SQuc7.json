The resolution directed five House standing committees to investigate the president's behavior and to report the results of those investigations to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nUnder House rules \u2014 enacted in January 2015, when Republicans had the majority \u2014 the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over impeachment, and it must air publicly the evidence it contends supports any articles of impeachment it may recommend to the full House.\n\nThe Constitution defines and limits the basis for impeachment as \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" In Trump's case, it is \"bribery or other high crimes\" that have formed the basis of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThus far, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has been holding closed-door hearings gathering evidence on these two points of constitutional inquiry.\n\nWhy closed-door?\n\nNo prosecutor or defense counsel would or ethically could offer a witness to testify publicly in a case without first having interviewed that witness in private.\n\nThese interviews are often open-ended, and the lawyer or investigator conducting the interview does not know in advance the full extent of what the witness can provide.\n\nSecrecy at this point enhances candor and permits an honest evaluation of the witness's credibility and usefulness to the case.\n\nHow did Congress acquire impeachment evidence in the past?\n\nIn the cases of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, special prosecutors gathered evidence of presidential wrongdoing in secret and then presented that evidence to the House Judiciary Committee, which aired it publicly.\n\nToday, even though the initial interviews of witnesses are taking place in secret, the Intelligence Committee is releasing transcripts of those interviews for the public to examine, well before it reports to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nWe know from those transcripts that Trump's threat to hold up $391 million in military hardware and financial aid to our ally Ukraine \u2014 which is fighting a bloody war with Russia \u2014 until the Ukraine government gave him a \"favor\" by commencing an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, was not a one-off.\n\nWe know from the testimony of these witnesses that the demand for the favor was the end part of a months' long concerted effort run by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 himself now the subject of two federal criminal investigations \u2014 to use the government of Ukraine to deliver dirt on Biden for Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nTrump has argued that this was not a quid pro quo, e.g., give me the dirt on Biden, and you will get your American aid.
