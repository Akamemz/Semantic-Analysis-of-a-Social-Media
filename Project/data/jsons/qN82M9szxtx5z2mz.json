    "content": "FLORENCE , S.C. -- Jeb Bush \u2019 s full-throated defense of his brother in the face of attacks from Donald Trump in Saturday \u2019 s debate reflects the former Florida governor \u2019 s tight embrace of his family legacy while on the verge of a make-or-break primary .\nIn perhaps the biggest risk of his campaign , Mr. Trump charged that \u201c The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush . He kept us safe ? That is not safe. \u201d Mr. Bush fired back with an impassioned defense of his brother \u2019 s leadership after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks . \u201c While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show , my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe . \u201d\nMr. Bush \u2019 s rallying to his family side , one year after he declared his independence by saying \u201c I am my own man , \u201d aims to capitalize on the Bushes \u2019 deep ties to the Palmetto State . At Mr. Bush \u2019 s event on Friday in Anderson , the audience offered three standing ovations for former Presidents George H.W . Bush and George W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush .\nThe day before , at a diner in Florence , Mr. Bush listened to two voters who gushed about their affection for his family before finally getting to their questions for the candidate .\n\u201c We love the Bushes , \u201d 44-year-old restaurant manager James Berry told the former governor . \u201c We love your family and your brother , when his popularity rating was low , we loved him . We didn \u2019 t care what anybody said because he had our backs . \u201d\nThe reservoir of goodwill in this early-voting state so crucial to the survival of Mr. Bush \u2019 s candidacy is the reason George W. Bush will make his first appearance in his brother \u2019 s campaign in North Charleston on Monday .\nThe relationship between the Bush family and South Carolina Republicans dates back to 1988 , when George H.W . Bush \u2019 s victory here put him on the glide path to the nomination . The state played a similar role in helping to cinch the nomination of George W. Bush in 2000 after he was upset by Republican rival John McCain in New Hampshire .\n\u201c We picked presidents so we felt like they were ours , \u201d said South Carolina-based Republican consultant Hogan Gidley , who advised Mike Huckabee \u2019 s presidential campaign until he recently dropped out .\nJeb Bush \u2019 s rivals have tried to make his family ties a liability . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has made a call for a new generation of leadership a cornerstone of his presidential pitch .\nMr. Trump has mocked him for meeting with \u201c mommy and daddy \u201d and condemned his brother for the protracted war in Iraq .\n\u201c We have to get rid of the Bushes , \u201d Mr. Trump said while campaigning in New Hampshire , adding that he viewed his competitor as a \u201c total stiff \u201d and a \u201c spoiled child . \u201d\nAfter disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire , Mr. Bush is betting that such attacks won \u2019 t sell in South Carolina and that his pedigree will give him a boost in Saturday \u2019 s primary .\n\u201c I \u2019 m honored to have my brother ( George ) be by my side , honored beyond belief , \u201d Mr. Bush said in a radio interview Friday . \u201c Donald Trump and anybody else that wants to be critical of George W. Bush\u2014I hope they do it because the people of South Carolina are sick and tired of people tearing down George W. Bush . \u201d\nThe connection between the Bushes and South Carolina goes beyond electoral victories . The Bushes \u2019 genteel , patrician image is embraced by some Southerners here as \u201c family values \u201d and \u201c decency \u201d \u2014especially in contrast to Mr. Trump \u2019 s penchant for coarse language .\nAnd in one of the most veteran-rich states in the country , the Bush administrations \u2019 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are a source of pride .\nNational security was the top concern named by South Carolina Republican voters in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC/Marist poll , and 68 % said they supported sending U.S. troops to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .\nAt events headlined by Jeb Bush last week , when voters were asked about his brother , they emphasized his leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks -- not the collapse of the economy , his administration \u2019 s oversight of Hurricane Katrina , or other darker moments during his presidency .\nSeven years after he left office with dismal approval ratings , the former president , to some , has become a symbol of military might in the face of terrorism , making him a coveted validator of Jeb Bush \u2019 s national-defense chops .\n\u201c Our belief is this will be a national-security primary , \u201d Mr. Bush said Thursday night in Columbia . \u201c It \u2019 s a commander-in-chief election , if you will . \u201d\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham , one of the best known military hawks in Congress who dropped out of the primary race in December , has been a constant presence at Mr. Bush \u2019 s side this week .\nWhen he was running for re-election to the Senate in 2014 , Mr. Graham boasted on Twitter that he had received a donation from the former president .\n\u201c I used him in a television commercial too because I know my state , \u201d Mr. Graham said in an interview Thursday . \u201c Every day that goes by , Barack Obama is making George W. Bush look better and better . \u201d\nMore than half of adults had a favorable view of the former president in a CNN/ORC poll last year , compared with only one-third when he left office in 2009 . Absence makes the heart grow fonder , polling experts say , and frustration with George W. Bush \u2019 s pursuit of war has been overlaid by mounting fears of the Islamic State militant group .\nIn South Carolina , Jeb Bush \u2019 s standard stump lines about building up military forces and overhauling the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are particularly well-received .\n\u201c As an ex-military wife , it \u2019 s personal to me , \u201d said 67-year-old Linda Cox , a retired teacher , after a rally in Sumter , the closest city to Shaw Air Force Base . Her friend , 65-year-old Debbie Hauptman , who also comes from a military family , asked Mr. Bush to sign a small statue of Uncle Sam .\nWhat is unclear is how much of the patriotism-laced Bush nostalgia will translate into actual votes for the former governor . And there is evidence that Mr. Rubio \u2019 s message is breaking through .\nAt a rally Wednesday at the Sun City retirement community in Hilton Head , some voters said the Bushes reminded them of the past , while Mr. Rubio drew comparisons to a young John F. Kennedy .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s time for a third Bush , \u201d said 73-year-old Bill Box . \u201c Enough is enough . \u201d\nStill , one positive sign for Mr. Bush is that his campaign moved a couple events last week to larger venues and had to turn people away from another .\nBut Mr. Berry , the voter at the diner in Florence who professed his love for the family , said he was voting for Mr. Trump . And at a nearby table , of the four voters who said they revered the Bush family , only one said he was a certain vote for Mr. Bush . \u201c As far as I \u2019 m concerned , the Bushes have kept us safe , \u201d said 65-year-old Randy Cox , an Air Force veteran .\nOver a lunch of stuffed cabbage , fried squash , beets and cornbread , one group sharing a booth in the packed diner explained their affection for the Bush pedigree .\n\u201c All the Bushes are a class act , \u201d said 77-year-old Marvin Slaughter , who was holding a signed biography of the first President Bush in his lap . \u201c I remember when George W.
