The other candidates are at 5 percent or less in the state .\nIn Iowa , Mrs. Clinton has 48 percent of support and Mr. Sanders has 45 percent as the competition between the two has become more contentious . Martin O \u2019 Malley , the third Democratic presidential candidate , has 5 percent in Iowa , meaning he will most likely qualify for the next presidential debate .\nBut in New Hampshire , the survey also found Mr. Sanders at 50 percent , to 46 percent for Mrs. Clinton .\nThat margin is smaller than a recent Fox News survey , in which Mr. Sanders led Mrs. Clinton by 13 points .
