Zimmerman claimed self-defense . White was n't buying it .\n`` I have two African-American sons and grandsons and I want to see things change for them , '' White said as protesters chanted `` No justice , no peace . ''\nThousands gathered Saturday at rallies in more than 100 cities nationwide to remember Trayvon , to press for federal civil rights charges against the man who shot him , and to attack stand-your-ground self-defense laws . The Justice Department is investigating whether Zimmerman , 29 , violated Martin 's civil rights when he shot the 17-year-old during a February 2012 confrontation in Sanford , Fla .\nAlthough Zimmerman ultimately did not use a `` stand your ground '' defense , the case brought stand-your-ground laws into the spotlight.At a rally in New York City , civil rights activist Al Sharpton took aim at those laws , which in more than a dozen states generally give people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear serious bodily harm . `` We are trying to change laws so that this never , ever happens again , '' Sharpton , who organized the nationwide rallies through his National Action Network , told the crowd .\nSybrina Fulton , Trayvon 's mother , spoke at the New York rally . `` Today it was my son . Tomorrow it might be yours , '' she warned the crowd . Trayvon 's father , Tracy Martin , echoed those sentiments at a rally in Miami . `` This could be any one of our children , '' he said . `` Our mission now is to make sure that this does n't happen to your child . ''\nIn Indianapolis , where a rally at the Birch Bayh Federal Building was cut short by a downpour , Pastor Michael K.Jones said the Zimmerman verdict `` should be a wake up call to us just like 9/11 was for all us in America . ''\n`` Do you know what America did after 9/11 ? We made some changes , '' Jones said . `` I came by today to tell someone 7/13 will never happen again . ''\nThe rallies drew the rich and famous , including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z in New York , but mostly the crowds consisted of regular folks who felt justice was not served at Zimmerman 's trial .\nIn Washington , D.C. , protester Hellen Smith , 45 , who brought her 14-year-old daughter , said she had mixed emotions about the verdict . She said jurors may not have had enough evidence to convict , but added that `` we have to stand up for any person of any race who has been unjustly murdered . ''\nWashington resident Ralph Reynaud , 69 , said the verdict shows that many people connect more easily with Zimmerman than with a black teen . `` There was no justice , '' Reynaud said . `` The letter of the law was executed , but the spirit of it was invalidated . ''\nIn Nashville , a rally-turned-prayer-service drew about 500 people . Brandi Walker of Goodlettsville and her three children were among them , carrying signs that read `` I am Travyon Martin '' and decorated with Skittles candy wrappers . Martin was returning home from a convenience store with some of those candies the night he died .\nWalker said the verdict in the Zimmerman trial made her afraid for her sons , who are 11 and 13 . `` They are not expendable , '' she said .\n\u2022 In Detroit , Onikha Lemurian said she joined thousands of others who gathered for outside the federal courthouse because she wanted to help guarantee a safer future for her grandsons . `` In this case , I do n't think justice was served , '' said Lemurian , 70 , of Detroit . `` I did not want to think that this would recur here or anywhere else . ''\n\u2022 In Wilmington , Del. , about 100 people \u2014 almost all of them African-American \u2014 gathered outside the J. Caleb Boggs Federal Building as passersby honked their horns in support . Local resident Mary Gilbert was upbeat , saying the verdict in the case will eventually have a positive effect on society . `` God is never wrong , so the verdict is n't wrong , '' Gilbert said . `` It 's making people of all races realize that something is wrong . ''\n\u2022 In Asheville , N.C. , where about 50 people gathered at the Vance Monument to tolerance , 16-year-old Liana Murray collected signatures on a petition urging the federal Justice Department to file charges against Zimmerman . `` He racially profiled and stalked a child and shot him because he was wearing a hoodie , '' Murray said . `` Wearing a hoodie and being a black young man in the U.S. is something seen as suspicious . ''\nMost of the rallies and vigils were taking place outside federal court buildings . Sharpton said the vigils will be followed by a conference next week in Miami to develop a plan to address Florida 's stand-your-ground law .\nThe rallies came a day after President Obama , speaking to reporters at an impromptu gathering in the White House briefing room , said that all Americans should respect the jury 's acquittal of Zimmerman , but that white Americans should also understand that African Americans are pained by Trayvon 's death and continue to face racial discrimination .\nObama told reporters that , like other African Americans , he has been followed by security guards while shopping , and has seen motorists lock their doors or women hold tighter to their purses as he walked near them . `` Those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida . ''\n`` I think it 's important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that does n't go away , '' Obama said , and `` it 's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching . ''\nThe president also questioned the wisdom of Florida 's stand-your-ground law and suggested people consider whether Trayvon also had the right to stand his ground , adding : `` Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman , who had followed him in a car , because he felt threatened ?
