'' Trevor Noah 's `` Daily Show '' has had a lot of fun with it :\nAnd it 's not just the adoring gaze . When Pence speaks , it is invariably in the most servile tones , always suggesting that he has never had a thought in his head that `` this president '' did n't `` direct '' him to have . He is the most loyal of all the Trump loyalists , a man who was saved from an ignominious failure as Indiana governor in 2016 and turned into the president 's personal political manservant .\nUp until this year , Pence had managed to be nothing more than a cipher in the Trump administration , performing the patented furrowed-brow , look-of-love act at public appearances and not much else . The speculation was that his empty-suit role may have saved him . By doing nothing except standing next to Trump and smiling benevolently , he might be a rare survivor of the Trump White House and might still have a political career after it 's over .\nI never thought that was possible . Pence 's close association with Trump has destroyed him , and if he runs for president he will be the Trump administration 's sin-eater . The base will have to make someone suffer for Trump 's failure , and Pence was always top of the list . Unfortunately for him , his role as the `` pandemic czar '' has probably sealed that fate .\nHad Pence been left to his regular houseboy routine he might have slipped into obscurity if Trump loses the election in November . But because he was assigned the thankless role of supposedly heading the coronavirus task force he 's now the face of the administration 's failure , right alongside the man he stares at so dreamily .\nSetting aside Pence 's lugubrious delivery and the apparent necessity to flatter the president in reverent tones , he started off doing a fairly decent job with the task force . His daily briefings , in the beginning , were hobbled by Trump 's often incoherent ramblings , which had to be explained away , but Pence at least allowed the experts to speak and take questions .\nUnder his early leadership the task force came up with guidelines called `` 30 Days to Slow the Spread , '' which Pence discussed at every appearance . Thirty days was always inadequate , but at least that conveyed a sense of urgency and was an attempt to get the whole country on the same page . But as soon as Trump saw that people were paying attention to the briefings he horned in on the action and we know how that went . The bizarre daily spectacle of the president blabbering on about hydroxychloroquine and injecting disinfectant signaled that any serious attempt at a national response was over .\nFrom that moment on , Pence has worked overtime to lose whatever small amount of credibility he was able to cultivate in those early days . The slide into Trumpian happy talk was demonstrated by Pence 's defiant refusal to wear a mask while palling around with Trump acolytes like Florida Gov Ron DeSantis as they declared `` Mission Accomplished , '' just a bit prematurely . Then Pence came out as a full-fledged propagandist with a big op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on June 16 , in which he threw down a straw man and lit it on fire :\nIn recent days , the media has taken to sounding the alarm bells over a `` second wave '' of coronavirus infections . Such panic is overblown .

Nobody was talking about a `` second wave . '' Everyone knows we are still in the first one . And despite his claims that his `` whole-of-America approach has been a success , '' Pence 's plans to `` slow the spread '' did not come close to working . The virus is out of control .\nBut the New York Times reported that in a phone call with governors around that same time , Pence encouraged them to lie , saying , `` I would just encourage you all , as we talk about these things , to make sure and continue to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing and that in most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rise in number , that 's more a result of the extraordinary work you 're doing . ''\nIn other words , he was telling them to parrot the president 's fatuous insistence that if we did n't have all this testing we would n't have all these cases .

They might as well have involved Trump himself standing up there talking about miracle cures and claiming that the virus is going to disappear on its own .
