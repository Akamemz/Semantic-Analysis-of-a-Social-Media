Foster , a Bush family loyalist from Houston who served on Jeb Bush \u2019 s national finance team . \u201c I would say some are enthusiastic for Ted , some are just saying , \u2018 OK , Ted \u2019 s not my first choice , but anyone that can beat Trump , I \u2019 ll support . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s a big motivating factor , \u201d he continued . \u201c I think Ted is the only possibility to stop Trump . \u201d\nFoster spent part of Monday afternoon writing a letter to other Bush alums and former donors , urging them to come on board with Cruz in order to stop Trump .\nThat Barbour or Foster , who have sharply differed with Cruz on substance and style , would even consider throwing in with the Texas senator speaks to how far the more centrist wing of the party is willing to bend in search of someone to beat Trump . Foster is a prominent advocate for comprehensive immigration reform , a stance which puts him completely at odds with Cruz \u2019 s recent suggestion of support for mass deportation .\nAnd Barbour spent much of 2014 helping Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran fend off a nasty primary challenge from insurgent state Sen. Chris McDaniel\u2014who is now Cruz \u2019 s Mississippi co-chair . Barbour backed Jeb Bush until he dropped out , and before that he supported Rick Perry , another former rival whom Cruz can now count among his supporters .\nThey \u2019 re not alone : Foster was on a list of eight Bush backers who transferred their support to Cruz that the campaign touted last week . Foster is trying to expand that list , bringing on board people like Chase Untermeyer , a former ambassador and Jeb Bush supporter who worked in both the George H.W . and George W. Bush administrations .\nAnd on Tuesday , Neil Bush\u2014brother of Jeb and former President George W. Bush\u2014was rolled out as one of the latest additions to Cruz \u2019 s national finance committee , despite the ex-president \u2019 s previous comments that he personally disliked Cruz . Certainly , among some Bush loyalists there remains the perception that Rubio \u2019 s run represented a betrayal of Bush , who once considered himself the senator \u2019 s mentor , along with lingering anger over Rubio \u2019 s role in sinking Bush \u2019 s disastrous campaign .\nWhatever the motivations , the defections are troubling news for Rubio . Already on the ropes after winning only two of the primary \u2019 s first 20 contests , the Florida senator has long been hoping for the establishment \u2019 s full backing to take on Trump .\nBut however much establishment figures might prefer Rubio , some fear that supporting him means putting resources into an operation that , even since the establishment field winnowed , has largely failed to slow down Trump \u2019 s march to the nomination . Meantime , Cruz has notched seven wins\u2014well behind Trump , certainly , but it \u2019 s a longer list , and far more delegates , than Rubio or John Kasich can currently claim .\n\u201c Ideologically , I \u2019 m more interested in Marco , but increasingly , I \u2019 m beginning to think about him the way so many people felt about Jeb : Good guy but he \u2019 s not winning , \u201d said David Jones , another Houston-based former member of Bush \u2019 s Texas leadership team .\nJones said he is personally torn between Rubio and Cruz , but added that while he considers Cruz a \u201c wacko \u201d on immigration , he also believes the Texas senator has the clearer path to actually winning the nomination . ( Texas has already voted in the primary , but his view is representative of those shared by national Republicans as well ) .\nIt \u2019 s not that Cruz has done anything to endear himself to the GOP elite . He \u2019 s still the thorn that , just weeks ago , they reviled so much that many were attempting to talk themselves into accepting Trump , hoping his deal-making style and blue-collar base would be a better bet in November than Cruz \u2019 s hardline brand of conservatism should the race come down to those two candidates .\nBut following two weeks in which Trump waffled in denouncing the Ku Klux Klan , made graphic references on a presidential debate stage and dropped out of the Conservative Political Action Conference , some of the GOP \u2019 s leading donors , strategists and party wise men are reconsidering Trump \u2019 s run in Michigan and Mississippi only added to that urgency , with his delegate lead continuing to grow .\n\u201c Cruz is the easier pick \u201d between Cruz and Trump , said Ed Rogers , a veteran Republican who spent nearly a decade in the Reagan and Bush White Houses and is now a prominent D.C. lobbyist . \u201c He is a real conservative Republican , he has a clear governing point of view , he understands Civics and he is a student of history .
