    "content": "Campaigning in New Hampshire over the weekend , former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden talked himself into another news cycle about his gaffes . He confused the first primary state for neighboring Vermont . Then he forgot where he had spoken on Dartmouth College \u2019 s campus just hours before .\n\u201c I want to be clear , I \u2019 m not going nuts , \u201d he told reporters , according to the Los Angeles Times . \u201c I \u2019 m not sure whether it was the medical school or where the hell I spoke . But it was on the campus . \u201d\nOn some level , this is nothing new for Biden , who has a history of slipping up and saying things that are slightly off or need clarification . And it \u2019 s true that the grind of the campaign trail , which puts candidates on a tireless schedule between states and time zones with little downtime , can be brutal for anyone .\nBut Biden \u2019 s off-the-cuff , rough-around-the-edges brand is being seen through a new lens in this presidential primary for the Democratic nomination : his age .\n\u201c I am in my 70s and I know they are in their 70s , and I couldn \u2019 t handle that , no way , \u201d Carol Rork , a 79-year-old resident of Britt , Iowa , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 after the Wing Ding dinner , where Biden spoke , in early August . An April poll from Reuters/Ipsos found more than half of Democrats were less likely to support a presidential candidate over age 70 .\nBiden \u2019 s campaign chalks it up to a press hungry for a juicy headline . Biden himself has attributed the coverage of his gaffes to his frontrunner status ; he has held a comfortable lead in early polls ever since jumping into the race , according to the RealClearPolitics polling average . That said , his campaign is acknowledging the narrative ; the campaign tweeted a video in which an Iowa voter told Biden that his \u201c fiery \u201d speech quelled any initial concerns she had about his age .\nBiden , at 76 , isn \u2019 t the oldest candidate in the current field ( that distinction goes to Bernie Sanders , who will be 79 by Election Day 2020 ) \u2014 but voters are increasingly questioning how old is too old to be president .\nBiden \u2019 s age comes up with voters on the campaign trail . Numerous voters in Iowa and New Hampshire told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u201c he \u2019 s too old \u201d when asked whether they were considering Biden .\n\u201c I hate to say it , but you need someone younger . He \u2019 s my age. \u201d Dawn Bassett , 72 , of Kanawha , Iowa , said of Biden .\n\u201c I liked Biden as vice president , but Joe has seen his days . I think he \u2019 s too old , \u201d Sarah Morris of Waterford , Vermont , said at an Elizabeth Warren event in New Hampshire .\nSubscribe to Today , Explained Looking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle ?

Subscribe on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Overcast , or wherever you listen to podcasts .\nAnd while several recent polls have found Biden still in the lead \u2014 including a Morning Consult 2020 poll released Monday night , which showed him at 33 percent , a full 13 points ahead of Sanders , his closest challenger \u2014 a few other recent polls have shown the 2020 race turning into a three-way tie between Biden , Warren , and Sanders .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not an issue of numerical age , but it \u2019 s an issue of how you act and do you look like you \u2019 re up to the job , and that \u2019 s why you \u2019 re not hearing about Sanders , \u201d said Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray .\nA February NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed 62 percent of voters said they had \u201c reservations \u201d or were \u201c very uncomfortable \u201d voting for a candidate over the age of 75 . And a Pew Research Center poll conducted in May showed just 3 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying the 70s are the best age for a president ( it \u2019 s worth noting that Biden , Sanders , and Warren are all in their 70s ) .\nThe Biden campaign is seemingly aware of this concern ; they recently released a video on Twitter of him talking to an unnamed Iowa voter , who tells Biden she wants to vote for a presidential candidate younger than she is \u2014 but \u201c when you got to the passionate fiery part of your speech , I stopped worrying , \u201d she says in the video .\nWe have to remember who we are \u2014 this is the United States of America . There is not a single thing we can not do if we do it together . pic.twitter.com/ALa3yqf2GD \u2014 Joe Biden ( @ JoeBiden ) August 24 , 2019\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think he can take on Trump for that reason . I don \u2019 t think Biden is quick enough and sharp enough to take him on , \u201d Campton , New Hampshire , voter Lizzy Berube told \u2588\u2588\u2588 at a recent Warren event in New Hampshire . \u201c His story is incredible , but he \u2019 s just too old . \u201d\nFrequent news about Biden \u2019 s gaffes has fueled these fears among voters in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire , especially as voters consider a potential general election matchup between the former vice president and Trump , who has already bestowed Biden with the nickname \u201c Sleepy Joe . \u201d\nOthers concerned with Biden \u2019 s age said it had less to do with gaffes than with the perception that Biden is out of touch with the current Democratic Party because he is staunchly moderate and has some controversial past votes on racial issues . ( Of course , it \u2019 s worth noting that close to 40 percent of Democrats identify as moderates . )\n\u201c Initially I really liked him but his actions and his voting history tainted [ that ] , \u201d said Kacey Marsh of Whitefield , New Hampshire , who is supporting the 77-year-old Sanders . Marsh said she didn \u2019 t think age mattered too much , adding , \u201c Age is a number ; it \u2019 s relative . \u201d\n\u201c I really don \u2019 t want to vote for Biden , \u201d said a younger voter , Rory O \u2019 Neil of Nashua , New Hampshire . \u201c I don \u2019 t like his blanket non-apologies . I think Biden represents old moderate Democratic norms . \u201d\nMany voters told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Biden \u2019 s years of experience in Washington could be considered an argument in favor of electing him president .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a creature of Washington \u2014 he has loads and loads of experience , \u201d said Colebrook , New Hampshire , voter John Jolles . But he echoed other voters \u2019 concern that Biden \u2019 s age could also be considered an electoral weakness .\nBiden has always been known for going off the cuff and saying things that get him into trouble .\nDuring his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign , Biden famously called Barack Obama \u201c the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. \u201d Biden later apologized for the remark and would eventually go on to be Obama \u2019 s running mate . The same year , he asked a paraplegic , wheelchair-using state senator from Missouri to \u201c stand up \u201d at a campaign rally . And in 2012 , Biden told an audience of mostly black voters that the Republican Party would \u201c put them in chains . \u201d\nBut recently , another narrative has come to define his campaign : a series of misspeaks and controversial comments that have raised questions about the possible effects of his age .\nThere was the time he waxed nostalgic about working with segregationist senators during his early days in the Senate , which California Sen. Kamala Harris weaponized against him in the first Democratic debate \u2014 one of the few times he saw a dip in the polls .\nBiden has repeatedly referred to former British Prime Minister Theresa May as the late Margaret Thatcher . He said he met with school shooting survivors from Parkland , Florida , as vice president , though the shooting happened in 2018 , well after Biden left office . After the recent mass shootings in El Paso , Texas , and Dayton , Ohio , Biden appeared to mix up those locations , before he caught himself .\nGaffes have always been part of Biden \u2019 s public image , well before this latest presidential run . His unscripted nature is a big part of his political persona , and he \u2019 s had a habit of making news for a slip of the tongue in years past . The big difference now is that Biden is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president , with each misspeak front and center .\nSo far , the gaffes haven \u2019 t sunk him in the polls . He has sat somewhat comfortably in the lead , 10 points ahead of the rest of the field in the polling average . But recent polls have shown the primary looking increasingly like a three-way race between him , Sanders , and Warren , who have their own electability hurdles . Sanders is also getting questions about age ; during a recent swing through New Hampshire , one voter directly asked him about the fact that he \u2019 s nearing 80 years , and about his health .\nAs voters continue to prioritize \u201c electability \u201d \u2014 or the ability to beat Trump \u2014 each slip-up is getting scrutinized heavily .\n\u201c He \u2019 s making more unforced errors than Sanders has , \u201d said University of New Hampshire pollster Andy Smith of Biden . \u201c If Biden \u2019 s message is \u2018 I \u2019 m electable , \u2019 you have to be able to demonstrate that . He \u2019 s given supporters cause to be concerned and given opponents an opportunity to go after him . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s candidacy is based on the premise that he \u2019 s the most electable candidate . The big question is whether voters \u2019 concerns about age will cut into his support down the line .\nAt a separate recent campaign stop in New Hampshire , Biden \u2019 s wife , Dr. Jill Biden , flat-out told voters they should consider her husband because he had the best chance to beat Trump .\n\u201c I know that not all of you are committed to my husband , and I respect that , but I want you to think about your candidate , his or her electability , and who \u2019 s going to win this race , \u201d she said . \u201c You know you may like another candidate better but you have to look at who \u2019 s going to win . Joe is that person . \u201d\nUnlike Warren ( the plans candidate ) and Sanders ( the political revolution candidate ) , the biggest part of Biden \u2019 s pitch to voters is that he has the best shot of unseating Trump in a general election and returning America to the normalcy it enjoyed in the pre-Trump era that Biden , as Obama \u2019 s vice president , embodies .\nThis political message may be all the more salient considering Sanders and Warren are Biden \u2019 s biggest competition right now , and both are seen as considerably more progressive than him . But Biden \u2019 s electability message also has an inherent weakness : If voters start thinking he \u2019 s not as electable as he says he is , his pitch sounds hollow .\n\u201c The moment he \u2019 s shown not to be electable , since they have no other reason to be attached to Joe Biden , it \u2019 s easy to move these voters to someone else , at least temporarily , \u201d Murray , the Monmouth pollster , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIt \u2019 s a feedback loop that can be seen in a Monmouth University poll released Monday that found a three-way tie between Biden , Sanders , and Warren ( a necessary caveat about this poll is its small sample size ) . The Monmouth poll showed Biden \u2019 s support had dropped among moderate and conservative-leaning voters , who redistributed themselves fairly evenly among Sanders and Warren . That \u2019 s in part owing to voters starting to pay attention to media coverage , which these days includes a fair amount of Biden \u2019 s gaffes , Murray told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBiden \u2019 s early support has \u201c been built [ with ] name recognition among voters who have not been paying a lot of attention , \u201d Murray told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c As support for Biden seems to be getting shakier , they \u2019 re looking around for another name that they know . \u201d",
