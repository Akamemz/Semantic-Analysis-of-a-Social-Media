It \u2019 s not even the Rev . Al Sharpton , despite his ubiquitous campaign on TV and the streets .\nRather , it \u2019 s liberal billionaire George Soros , who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy , not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org .\nMr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S. , according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn all , Mr. Soros gave at least $ 33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots , on-the-ground activists in Ferguson , according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations .\nThe financial tether from Mr. Soros to the activist groups gave rise to a combustible protest movement that transformed a one-day criminal event in Missouri into a 24-hour-a-day national cause celebre .\n\u201c Our DNA includes a belief that having people participate in government is indispensable to living in a more just , inclusive , democratic society , \u201d said Kenneth Zimmerman , director of Mr. Soros \u2018 Open Society Foundations \u2019 U.S. programs , in an interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Helping groups combine policy , research [ and ] data collection with community organizing feels very much the way our society becomes more accountable . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Ferguson mock \u2018 grand jury \u2019 indicts former Officer Darren Wilson for first-degree murder\nMr. Zimmerman said OSF has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early \u2018 90s , and that , although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of Mr. Soros \u2018 grants , they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of Open Society .\n\u201c The incidents , whether in Staten Island , Cleveland or Ferguson , were spontaneous protests \u2014 we don \u2019 t have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say , \u201d Mr. Zimmerman said . \u201c But these circumstances focused people \u2019 s attention \u2014 and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like Ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation . \u201d\nSoros-sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in Ferguson , building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign .\nOther Soros-funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep , and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive .\nThe plethora of organizations involved not only shared Mr. Soros \u2018 funding , but they also fed off each other , using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another \u2019 s website , referencing each other \u2019 s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of Facebook \u201c likes \u201d and Twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds .\nBuses of activists from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference in Chicago ; from the Drug Policy Alliance , Make the Road New York and Equal Justice USA from New York ; from Sojourners , the Advancement Project and Center for Community Change in Washington ; and networks from the Gamaliel Foundation \u2014 all funded in part by Mr. Soros \u2014 descended on Ferguson starting in August and later organized protests and gatherings in the city until late last month .\nAll were aimed at keeping the media \u2019 s attention on the city and to widen the scope of the incident to focus on interrelated causes \u2014 not just the overpolicing and racial discrimination narratives that were highlighted by the news media in August .\n\u201c I went to Ferguson in a quest to be in solidarity and stand with the young organizers and affirm their leadership , \u201d said Kassandra Frederique , policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance , which was founded by Mr. Soros , and which receives $ 4 million annually from his foundation . She traveled to Ferguson in October .\n\u201c We recognized this movement is similar to the work we \u2019 re doing at DPA , \u201d said Ms. Frederique . \u201c The war on drugs has always been to operationalize , institutionalize and criminalize people of color . Protecting personal sovereignty is a cornerstone of the work we do and what this movement is all about . \u201d\nMs. Frederique works with Opal Tometi , co-creator of # BlackLivesMatter \u2014 a hashtag that was developed after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida \u2014 and helped promote it on DPA \u2019 s news feeds . Ms. Tometi runs the Black Alliance for Just Immigration , a group to which Mr. Soros gave $ 100,000 in 2011 , according to the most recent of his foundation \u2019 s tax filings .\n\u201c I think # BlackLivesMatter \u2019 s success is because of organizing . This was created after Trayvon Martin , and there has been sustained organizing and conversations about police violence since then , \u201d said Ms. Frederique . \u201c Its explosion into the mainstream recently is because it connects all the dots at a time when everyone was lost for words . \u2018 Black Lives Matter \u2019 is liberating , unapologetic and leaves no room for confusion . \u201d\nWith the backing of national civil rights organizations and Mr. Soros \u2018 funding , \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d grew from a hashtag into a social media phenomenon , including a # BlackLivesMatter bus tour and march in September .\n\u201c More than 500 of us have traveled from Boston , Chicago , Columbus , Detroit , Houston , Los Angeles , Nashville , Portland , Tucson , Washington , D.C. , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , and other cities to support the people of Ferguson and help turn a local moment into a national movement , \u201d wrote Akiba Solomon , a journalist at Colorlines , describing the event .\nColorlines is an online news site that focuses on race issues and is published by Race Forward , a group that received $ 200,000 from Mr. Soros \u2019 s foundation in 2011 . Colorlines has published tirelessly on the activities in Ferguson and heavily promoted the # BlackLivesMatter hashtag and activities .\nAt the end of the # BlackLivesMatter march , organizers met with civil rights groups like the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment to strategize their operations moving forward , Ms. Solomon wrote . OBS and MORE are also funded by Mr. Soros .\nMr. Soros gave $ 5.4 million to Ferguson and Staten Island grass-roots efforts last year to help \u201c further police reform , accountability and public transparency , \u201d the Open Society Foundations said in a blog post in December . About half of those funds were earmarked to Ferguson , with the money primarily going to OBS and MORE , the foundation said .\nOBS and MORE , along with the Dream Defenders , established the \u201c Hands Up Coalition \u201d \u2014 another so-called \u201c grass-roots \u201d organization in Missouri , whose name was based on now-known-to-be-false claims that Brown had his hands up before being shot . The Defenders were built to rally support and awareness for the Trayvon Martin case and were funded by the Tides Foundation , another recipient of Soros cash .\nHands Up Coalition has made it its mission to recruit and organize youth nationwide to start local events in their communities \u2014 trying to take Ferguson nationwide .\nHands Up Coalition has dubbed 2015 as \u201c The Year of Resistance , \u201d and its outreach program strongly resembles how President Obama \u2019 s political action committee \u2014 Organizing for Action \u2014 rallies youth for its causes , complete with a similarly designed Web page and call to action .\nMr. Soros , who made his fortune betting against the British pound during the currency crisis in the early \u2018 90s , is a well-known supporter of progressive-liberal causes and is a political donor to Mr. Obama \u2019 s campaigns . He committed $ 1 million to Mr. Obama \u2019 s super PAC in 2012 .\nMr. Soros \u2018 two largest foundations manage almost $ 3 billion in assets per year , according to their most recent respective tax returns . The Foundation to Promote Open Society managed $ 2.2 billion in assets in 2011 , and his Open Society Institute managed $ 685.9 million in 2012 .\nIn comparison , David and Charles Koch , the billionaire brothers whom liberals often call a threat to democracy \u2014 and worse \u2014 for their conservative influence , had $ 308 million tied up in their foundation and institute in 2011 .\nOne of the organizations that Mr. Soros funds , and which fueled the demonstrations in Ferguson , is the Gamaliel Foundation , a network of grass-roots , interreligious and interracial organizations . Mr. Obama started his career as a community organizer at a Gamaliel affiliate in Chicago .\nThe Rev . Traci Blackmon of Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant , Missouri , which is part of the Gamaliel network , said in one of the group \u2019 s webinars that clergy involved with Gamaliel must be \u201c protectors of the narrative \u201d of what happened in Ferguson .\nThe Gamaliel affiliate in St. Louis \u2014 Metropolitan Congregations United \u2014 organized the \u201c Weekend of Resistance \u201d in October , in which clergy members from around the nation were called to come to Ferguson to protest .\nRepresentatives of Sojourners , a national evangelical Christian organization committed \u201c to faith in action for social justice , \u201d attended the weekend . The group received $ 150,000 from Mr. Soros in 2011 .\nClergy representatives from the Samuel Dewitt Proctor Conference , where the Rev . Jeremiah Wright serves as a trustee , also showed up . Mr. Wright was Mr. Obama \u2019 s pastor in Chicago before some of his racially charged sermons , including the phrase \u201c God damn America , \u201d forced Mr. Obama to distance himself . SDPC received $ 250,000 from Mr. Soros in 2011 .\nDuring Gamaliel \u2019 s weekend protest event , Sunday was deemed \u201c Hands Up Sabbath , \u201d where clergy were asked to speak out about racial issues , using packets and talking points prepared for them by another religion-based community organizing group , PICO .\nPICO is also supported by the Open Society Foundations , according to its website .\nThe weekend concluded Monday , when clergy members were asked to lead in acts of civil disobedience , prompting many of them to go to jail in the hopes of gaining media attention .\nIt worked , as imagery of clergy members down on their hands and knees in front of police dominated the mainstream news cycle that day \u2014 two months after Brown \u2019 s shooting .\n\u201c After the initial shooting , we were all hit in the face with how blatant racism really is , \u201d said the Rev . Susan Sneed , a Gamaliel organizer who helped stage the October weekend event . \u201c We began quickly hearing from our other affiliates offering support . \u201d\nAt the end of August , Gamaliel had a large organizational meeting to discuss its Ferguson strategy , Ms. Sneed said .\nIt had its affiliates in New York and California handling the St. Louis Twitter feed and Facebook page , helped in correcting any inaccurate stories in the press and promoted their events , she said .\n\u201c When we started marching down the street , saying , \u2018 hands up , don \u2019 t shoot , \u2019 those images reached all over the world , \u201d said Ms. Sneed , referring to the moment she realized Ferguson was going to become a movement . \u201c The Twitter images , Facebook posts of burning buildings \u2014 it \u2019 s everywhere , and the imagery is powerful .

A lot of the same people were out at the protests and going out to lunch and talking about what was happening . That became a cycle until a lot of us figured out we needed to have a strategy , \u201d Mr. Fellows explained to the ACLU , which posted the interview in its blog .\n\u201c Then a lot of organizers from across the country started to come in to help us do the planning and do the strategizing .
