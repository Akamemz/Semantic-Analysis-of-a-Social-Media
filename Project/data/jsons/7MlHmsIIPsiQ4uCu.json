    "content": "President Obama did his best to shift his administration 's focus to the economy today during a speech at Illinois ' Knox College by blaming the anemic economy on Republicans and `` phony scandals . ''\nAs predicted , Obama gave America the same speech he 's been giving for five years , saying the country needs more infrastructure spending due to crumbling roads and bridges , that we must fight poverty , that CEOs are making too much money while the poor suffer etc . He even went so far as to tout `` saving the auto industry '' one week after Detroit filed for bankruptcy .\n`` Today , five years after the start of that Great Recession , America has fought its way back . Together , we saved the auto industry , took on a broken health care system , and invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil and double wind and solar power , '' Obama said . `` Together , we put in place tough new rules on big banks , and protections that cracked down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies . We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families , locking in tax cuts for 98 % of Americans , and asking those at the top to pay a little more .
