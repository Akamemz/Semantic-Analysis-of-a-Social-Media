    "content": "For years pro-life activists have raised concerns about President Obama 's healthcare overhaul and the way it forces taxpayers to subsidize abortion . The administration has long assured Americans Obamacare does not subsidize abortion services , despite the White House 's close ties to abortion giant Planned Parenthood . President Obama promised repeatedly that not a dime of taxpayer money would go toward funding abortions through Obamacare .\n`` Under our plan , no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions , '' Obama promised in 2009 .\nFurther , Obamacare received its final and necessary 60th vote from former Nebraska Senator Ben Nelson based on the promise abortion subsidies would n't be included in the bill .\nNow , a new report from the Government Accountability Office shows that Obamacare does in fact force taxpayers to foot the bill for abortion services by simply ignoring strict regulations and laws put in place to prohibit subsidization . The report shows more than 1000 Obamacare insurance plans in different states do not separate funding for abortion services from coverage as required by law .\n`` We provided a draft of this report to HHS , for CMS , and to OPM for comment . In its written comments , reproduced in enclosure III , HHS stated that , in addition to issuing a regulation governing the provision of health insurance coverage by QHPs , CMS also had answered individual questions from issuers and provided limited guidance to help ensure that stakeholders , including states and issuers , understand and follow the rules relating to coverage of abortion services in QHPs . However , HHS stated that , based upon our findings , additional clarification may be needed and CMS will use our findings to address issues of concern to better ensure that stakeholders understand the laws and regulations governing the provision of non-excepted abortion services coverage , '' GAO recommended after its findings .\nSusan B.
