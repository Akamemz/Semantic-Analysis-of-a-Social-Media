    "content": "Republican front-runner Donald Trump took a new round of shots at the GOP 's nominating process Sunday , while his newly-hired convention manager Paul Manafort accused Trump 's rival Ted Cruz of using `` gestapo tactics '' to earn delegate support at nominating conventions across the country .\nSpeaking to thousands packed in a frigid airport hangar in western New York , Trump argued anew that the person who wins the most votes in the primary process should automatically be the GOP nominee .\n`` What they 're trying to do is subvert the movement with crooked shenanigans , '' Trump said . The real estate mogul compared himself to Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders , who is well behind Hillary Clinton in that party 's delegate race despite a string of state wins .\n`` We should have won it a long time ago , '' Trump said . `` But , you know , we keep losing where we 're winning . ''\nTrump was introduced at the rally by Buffalo real estate developer and 2010 New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino , who said that talk of a brokered Republican convention `` suggests that they can take that right away from the American people to choose their leader . ''\nManafort , a veteran GOP strategist who worked on White House campaigns for President Gerald Ford in 1976 and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole in 1996 , told NBC 's `` Meet The Press '' that the Cruz campaign was using a `` scorched earth '' approach in which `` they do n't care about the party . If they do n't get what they want , they blow it up . ''\nManafort added that the Trump campaign is filing protests because the Cruz campaign is `` not playing by the rules . \u201d\n\u201c You go to his county conventions and you see the gestapo tactics , '' he said .\nTrump has a 743-to-545 delegate lead over the Texas senator , with the end of the primary/caucus season fast approaching . Over the weekend , Cruz completed his sweep of Colorado 's 34 delegates by locking up the remaining 13 at the party 's state convention in Colorado Springs . He already had collected 21 delegates and visited the state to try to pad his numbers there .\nCruz came out ahead in the Colorado contest , though , after dedicating resources to the convention process and putting in personal face time on the day of the final vote , something Trump did not do . The Trump campaign \u2019 s flyers in Colorado naming their preferred delegates were also riddled with errors . While Trump aides blamed the state party for giving them bad information , the party pushed back .\nAnd on Twitter , the Colorado GOP retweeted a message , saying : \u201c You may not like CO 's caucus system , but it 's representative , and claiming delegates were 'stolen ' insults the Republicans who participated . \u201d\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier also retweeted a message saying the rules \u201c were publicly available for months to people who know how to read and understand words . \u201d\nPolls show Trump holding a sizable lead in the next big state contest , New York 's April 19 primary , but Cruz is trying to chip away at Trump 's home-state advantage in conservative pockets of the Empire State .\nOhio Gov . John Kasich is third with 143 delegates , behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who ended his campaign March 15 with 171 committed delegates .\nManafort insisted Sunday that he \u2019 s still connected enough to wrangle delegates .\n`` You would be surprised who 's been calling me over the last week and where they 're from , '' he said . `` Do I know the 25- , 30-year-old delegates ?
