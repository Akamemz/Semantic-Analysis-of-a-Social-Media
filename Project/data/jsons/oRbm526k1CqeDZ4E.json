    "content": "US politics has gone in some pretty strange directions lately . But now the Pew Research Center has come along to try to make sense of just what Americans are thinking , with a new edition of its study of Americans ' political typology \u2014 its first since 2014 .\nPew 's analysis stands out from standard polls because it does n't simply sort Americans by demographic factors like age , race , and gender , and instead finds divisions within political parties that don \u2019 t fall along typical lines . To them , it \u2019 s not all about Hillary voters versus Bernie voters , or Trump populists versus establishment Republicans \u2014 what people actually believe creates divisions that are more complicated than that .\nInstead , in surveys this summer of about 5,000 people , Pew asked respondents several ideological questions , and then used statistical techniques to try to figure out the clearest way to divide respondents \u2019 views into a series of coherent groups . The questions present respondents with a stark choice between two very different options :\nThe actual survey respondents could also volunteer that they \u2019 re unsure or don \u2019 t know . Still , it 's true that this format does n't allow for much moderation or nuance . But in a system with two major parties ( and a media environment that often lacks nuance ) , your choice about which statement you most agree with \u2014 or which one you \u2019 re most repelled by \u2014 can be very revealing . Here \u2019 s what Pew found .\n1 ) Pew splits the politically engaged public into eight groups\nIn analyzing how the responses differed , Pew ended up dividing politically engaged voters into eight groups . Among Republicans , the \u201c Core Conservatives \u201d \u2014 traditional GOP voters \u2014 is the largest and most engaged group . \u201c Country First Conservatives , \u201d who we might think of as anti-immigration Trump fans , are relatively small in comparison . Then , two GOP-leaning groups that tend to get less attention in punditry are \u201c Market Skeptic Republicans , \u201d who stand out for their concern about the economic system favoring the powerful , and \u201c New Era Enterprisers \u201d ( they \u2019 re pretty moderate on social issues but economically conservative ) .\nFor Democrats , meanwhile , the party \u2019 s base is represented by \u201c Solid Liberals. \u201d But Pew also concludes there are blocs of \u201c Opportunity Democrats \u201d ( who are less concerned with discrimination and tend to have a more optimistic view of how hard work can lead to success ) , \u201c Disaffected Democrats \u201d ( who think the American dream is out of reach and are generally cynical about the system ) , and \u201c Devout and Diverse \u201d ( kind of a grab bag of mostly Democrat-leaning voters who are more conservative on one issue or another ) . Finally , there are \u201c Bystanders \u201d who aren \u2019 t engaged in the political process at all .\n2 ) The most ideologically polarized subgroups are the most politically engaged subgroups\nWant to know why US politics is so polarized ? Look at the above charts . They show three different measures of political engagement \u2014 whether people say they follow political news , whether they say they vote , and whether they think it matters who controls Congress .\nOn all three , the groups that are most likely to care are the solid liberals and the core conservatives \u2014 the groups that are most ideological and furthest apart from each other on their actual views . So when it comes to both winning primaries and mobilizing the base to turn out in the general election , that \u2019 s who the parties cater to most .\n3 ) On the importance of racial discrimination , there \u2019 s incredible partisan polarization \u2014 but also a split among Democrats\nThe sheer amount of polarization in how Democratic- and Republican-leaning subgroups respond to questions about race is stark \u2014 and that polarization is greatest among \u201c solid liberals \u201d and \u201c core conservatives , \u201d the most politically engaged groups .\nEighty-four percent of solid liberals think racism is a big problem , while only 26 percent of core conservatives do . Ninety-one percent of solid liberals say they think discrimination is \u201c the main reason blacks can \u2019 t get ahead \u201d\nNote on the bottom of the chart , though , that Democrats aren \u2019 t completely united on race either . That question was framed as a binary choice between \u201c racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can \u2019 t get ahead these days , \u201d and \u201c blacks who can \u2019 t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition . \u201d\nSolid liberals overwhelmingly agreed with the former statement , while responses from the other three Democratic-leaning subgroups were much more mixed . ( And solid liberals also happen to be the most heavily white Democratic-leaning subgroup , so this discrepancy isn \u2019 t necessarily about white Democrats downplaying the importance of race . )\n4 ) Most solid liberals say they have trouble even being friends with Trump voters\nSolid liberals really , really do not like Donald Trump \u2014 so much so that 55 percent of them say that if a friend of theirs voted for Trump , it would strain their friendship . It \u2019 s a dramatic result that stands out a great deal . ( There \u2019 s no real counterpart for it among how Republican-leaning voters say they \u2019 d react to a Hillary Clinton-supporting friend . )\n5 ) Most Americans \u2014 including a good chunk of Republicans \u2014 want corporate taxes raised , not lowered\nThe Republican Party has convinced itself that passing an enormous corporate tax cut is their best hope for success in the 2018 midterms . But far more actual voters seem to want corporate taxes to go up , not down \u2014 and a significant chunk of those voters are Republican .\nOverall , support for lowering corporate taxes comes overwhelmingly from core conservatives . Two of the other right-leaning groups are split on the matter , and respondents categorized in another GOP-leaning group \u2014 \u201c Market Skeptical Republicans \u201d \u2014 are far more likely to say they want corporate taxes raised . So perhaps the Republican tax bill will be more divisive among the GOP coalition than many expect .\n6 ) It \u2019 s only a vocal minority of Americans who are anti-immigrant\nAnother question in the survey asked respondents whether immigrants \u201c are a burden on our country because they take our jobs , housing , and health care , \u201d or whether they \u201c strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents. \u201d And 65 percent of overall respondents said they agreed with the latter statement , while only 26 percent agreed with the former one .\nYet the view of immigrants as a burden is completely overwhelming among one Republican-leaning subgroup \u2014 \u201c Country First Conservatives. \u201d Those \u201c Market Skeptical Republicans \u201d who don \u2019 t want a corporate tax cut also tend to view immigrants as a problem .
