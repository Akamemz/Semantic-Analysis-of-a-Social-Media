He told me that the caravan that \u2019 s now making its way through Mexico headed for the southern border was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela . '' Read more on this development here .\nOn Wednesday 's episode of `` The Glenn Beck Radio Program , '' Glenn reacted to the vice president 's announcement .\n`` Have you noticed that the press is not concerned at all about this caravan ? '' Glenn asked . `` They say the caravan 's not going to make it up to the United States , that it 's just nonsense and why are they talking about it . Really ? ''\nGlenn noted that the 7,000-person-strong migrant caravan seems to be both a political message and a weapon .\n`` We know that this migrant invasion force was organized in Honduras by the leftist political party looking to embarrass the current right-wing government , '' Glenn said . `` We know that . But you 're not going to hear that on television . You 're not going to hear that from the leftist mainstream news . You wo n't hear it because that hurts their case . They want everybody to look like they 're just weak , and helpless , and children making a 2,500-mile march . Wow ! That seems pretty strong to me . This entire charade has indeed been one giant political stunt . ''\nGlenn pointed out that moving more than 7,000 people across 2,500 miles is incredibly expensive .

'' Glenn asked . `` If you \u2019 re Venezuelan President Maduro and you want to attack the United States , but barely have enough money to buy any toilet paper , how do you do it ? Well , you do n't use conventional means . You reach out to your allies , your revolutionaries , your Marxist zealots in South America and you organize and fund thousands of people to flood the U.S . border . ''\n`` It 's a pretty inventive way to strike back , '' Glenn continued . `` Not only is it a form of economic warfare , but it also destabilizes the U.S. political structure .
