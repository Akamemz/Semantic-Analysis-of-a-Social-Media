Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat and chief sponsor of the bill . \u201c With this agreement , we have now answered every criticism that has come forward about the immigration bill . \u201d\nThe proposal would require hiring 20,000 more Border Patrol agents and deploying them to the U.S.-Mexico border , which more than doubles the 18,462 agents there as of January , and require another 350 miles of pedestrian fencing along with the 352 miles that exist .\nIllegal immigrants still would get quick \u201c provisional \u201d legal status and work permits before those conditions are met . But they would not be able to get green cards -\u2014 signifying the key step on the path to citizenship \u2014 until the 20,000 agents and new fencing are checked off .\nMr. Schumer said he was able to sign off on the added security because this week \u2019 s report from the Congressional Budget Office showed the bill will reduce the federal deficit by nearly $ 200 billion over 10 years , thanks to added taxes from additional foreign workers and legalized immigrants . Mr. Schumer said those savings can be plowed back into border security .\nSen. John Hoeven , the North Dakota Republican who negotiated the border security amendment with fellow Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee , said he expects the added security will cost slightly more than $ 30 billion \u2014 with $ 25 billion of that going to hire and pay the new Border Patrol salaries .\nCritics said the bill doesn \u2019 t require results , but rather relies on checking off boxes for agents hired and money spent .\n\u201c All we have are more promises about future performance , and I must say our record of keeping our promises when it comes to immigration reform are beyond pathetic , \u201d said Sen. John Cornyn , Texas Republican . He pointed to the 1996 promise of an entry-exit system to check all visitors \u2019 visas \u2014 a system that still isn \u2019 t in place .\nThe Senate bill again promises to complete the system , though it waters down existing law by dropping the requirement for biometric identifiers such as fingerprints , and does not require checks for those crossing on the ground , only those entering at airports and seaports .\nDemocrats have objected to requiring any hard measures of security , saying they fear a future Republican president would fiddle with the numbers to delay the path to citizenship .\nSen.

[ John ] McCain . I can look anybody in the eye and tell them that if you put 20,000 Border Patrol agents on the border in addition to the 20,000 we \u2019 ve already got \u2014 that \u2019 s one every 1,000 feet \u2014 that will work , \u201d Mr. Graham said . \u201c If you build the fence , that all helps . So I don \u2019 t need any more than just getting it in place . \u201d\nAt one point , Mr. Cornyn mocked Mr. McCain , Arizona Republican , for flip-flopping on adding border agents and fencing .\nOn Wednesday , Mr. McCain blasted Mr. Cornyn \u2019 s proposal to build fencing and add 5,000 agents , saying it was too expensive and that those decisions should be left to the Homeland Security Department . But on Thursday , Mr. McCain embraced the Hoeven-Corker proposal .\n\u201c Now I find to my shock and amazement the distinguished senior senator from Arizona saying we need 20,000 more Border Patrol , \u201d Mr. Cornyn said .\nMr. McCain replied that his state has taken the brunt of illegal immigration and drug-smuggling , and he is eager for a solution that will work .\n\u201c I take a back seat to no one , even from the great state of Texas , \u201d he said .\nMr. Cornyn \u2019 s own border security amendment , which would have prevented illegal immigrants from getting green cards until the government was successfully preventing or turning back 90 percent of illegal crossers , was defeated on a 54-43 vote earlier in the day .\nStill , that vote fractured the Gang of Eight as Sen.
