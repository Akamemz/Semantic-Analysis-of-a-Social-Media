    "content": "A recent story in The Atlantic laid out three possible reasons why retail job losses remain hidden under the political and media radar : geography , demographics , and nostalgia .\nHow has the retail bloodletting been so much quieter than the decline in mining and manufacturing ? There are several plausible explanations . First , mining and manufacturing jobs are geographically concentrated . Sixty percent of coal-mining jobs are in just four states : West Virginia , Kentucky , Pennsylvania , and Wyoming . Retail is spread more evenly across the country , so there are \u201c mining towns , \u201d which politicians can visit and photographers can capture and where the pain runs especially deep , in a way there are not \u201c mall towns. \u201d Second , as Slate Chief Political Correspondent Jamelle Bouie tweeted , the demographics of a job can determine its political salience . Coal mining is still 95 percent white and 95 percent male . Department store workers are 40 percent minority and just 40 percent male . The emphasis on work that is white , male , and burly may represent an implicit bias against the working class of the modern service economy , which is more diverse and female . Third , mining and manufacturing jobs feed into a national nostalgia for the mid-century economy , with its unionized workforce , economic growth , and high pay for men without much education .\nA story from Slate by that same Jamelle Bouie makes the same argument :\nIn terms of attention , [ coal miners ] punch far above their weight class . They constitute a small portion of the American workforce , and yet , elite journalists devote countless words to their lives and communities , while politicians use them and their priorities as a platform for performing authenticity . For those in and around politics , one \u2019 s connection to \u201c real America \u201d is often judged by one \u2019 s proximity to these workers and their concerns . Which raises a question : Why them and not those retail workers who face an equally ( if not more ) precarious future ? ... Retail work in malls and shopping centers and department stores is largely work done by women . Of the nearly 6 million people who work in those fields in stores like Sears , Michaels , Target , J.C. Penney , and Payless , close to 60 percent are women . \u2026 A substantial portion of these workers\u2014roughly 40 percent across the different kinds of retail\u2014are black , Latino , or Asian American . ... Work is gendered and it is racialized . What work matters is often tied to who performs it . It is no accident that those professions dominated by white men tend to bring the most prestige , respect , and pay , while those dominated by women\u2014and especially women of color\u2014are often ignored , disdained , and undercompensated .\nMany of us likely had a retail job at some point in our lives . Maybe we worked at a corner mom-and-pop shop or worked weekend and evening shifts at a store in a nearby mall . My own experience was peddling popcorn behind the candy counter at a mall multiplex . The pay was barely above minimum wage , but at least I got to see movies for free .\nSears Roebuck and Co. used to be the biggest name in retail . It advertised itself as the store \u201c where America shops. \u201d It once had a booming catalog business that sold mail-order house kits and was where much of America bought appliances and tools . Now , with competition from big-box stores ( also not doing well ) and online shopping , Sears is closing stores and might be on the verge of collapse : The company lost $ 2 billion in 2016 , and sales dropped 10.3 percent in the fourth quarter , when many stores finally sell enough to be in the black . According to an NPR story :\nDespite its merger with Kmart in 2005 , Sears has consistently lost millions of dollars each quarter . The retailer has closed hundreds of stores , slashed jobs and sold off key assets like the Lands ' End clothing line and its legendary Craftsman brand \u2014 although both brands continue to be sold at Sears . Independent retail analyst Sucharita Mulpuru says these changes have n't worked . `` There are just so many onerous forces relating to competition , '' she says . `` I think that no matter what they do , they are fighting a losing battle . ''\nAnd what of Sears workers ? The generous employee discount program is gone , replaced with a \u201c point system. \u201d Some 250 employees at Sears \u2019 corporate offices were laid off last year , and 150 openings went unfilled . If you worked in sales and your store closed , you \u2019 re out of luck .\nOf course , Sears isn \u2019 t alone . In a trend a story in Business Insider dubs the \u201c retail apocalypse , \u201d more than 3,500 stores are expected to close in the next few months of 2017 . It \u2019 s being described as \u201c one of the biggest waves of retail closures in decades . \u201d\nThis might have been avoided if malls weren \u2019 t overbuilt to begin with . The Business Insider story reports that the United States \u201c has 23.5 square feet of retail space per person , compared with 16.4 square feet in Canada and 11.1 square feet in Australia , the next two countries with the most retail space per capita. \u201d When a major anchor store in a mall closes , smaller stores are soon to follow . \u201c Nearly a third of shopping malls are at risk of dying off as a result of store closures , '' the story added . What do those workers do then ?\nRetail workers aren \u2019 t highly paid . Some , especially those in higher-end clothing stores , are paid on commission .
