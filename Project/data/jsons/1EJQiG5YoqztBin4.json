As is his right and wont, he doesn\u2019t understand America like the rest of us. It\u2019s not altogether his fault. He obtained his early education in Muslim schools in Indonesia, where whatever pride is taken is pride taken in the exceptionalism of Mr. Mohammed. Most of us learn the customs and rituals of American history in the early years, and Mr. Obama was deprived of that (more\u2019s the pity).\n\nListening to others taking pride, sometimes even inordinate pride, in the nation\u2019s history makes the president\u2019s toes itch.

He filed an exception.\n\n\u201cI believe in American exceptionalism,\u201d he once told an inquiring reporter, \u201cjust as I suspect the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks in Greek exceptionalism.\u201d The president had not a clue to what his inquirer was talking about.\n\nAnd there was more: \u201cNow, the fact that I am very proud of my country and I think that we\u2019ve got a whole lot to offer does not lessen my interest in recognizing the value and wonderful qualities of other countries, or recognizing that we\u2019re not always going to be right, or that other people may have good ideas, or that in order for us to work collectively, all parties have to compromise and that includes us.\u201d\n\nSome of that is true enough, but that is not what American exceptionalism, as Lincoln defined it, means.
