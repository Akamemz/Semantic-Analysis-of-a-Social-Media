    "content": "The social conservatives are very , very restless . Like everyone except lobbyists and billionaires , they feel betrayed and taken for granted by the GOP . These are valuable Republican foot soldiers and the establishment ignores their demands at their peril . It is the single biggest faction of the party . But giving in to them could mean a big loss at the ballot box in 2016 .\nThat 's not to say they are alone , however . It 's likely that most people do n't fully realize just how overwrought the entire Republican base is over this latest budget deal . Political observers knew that when Speaker John Boehner resigned the fix was in for a budget deal for this year . His swan song deal to set the top line numbers for two years paved the way for the new speaker to pass an agreement during his honeymoon . There was a little hiccup with the presumptive successor Kevin McCarthy turning out to be a dolt whose loose lips sank Trey Gowdy 's ship on national TV , but eventually they brought in the BMOC Paul Ryan to get the job done .\nUnfortunately , the rabid GOP base does not observe such antiquated concepts as political honeymoons and they refuse to admit that shutting down the government is not a useful tactic . They expect their representatives to hold the line , no matter what . And when they do n't , there is hell to pay .\nEvery day since the budget deal was reached , the inboxes of conservatives have been filled with angry , vitriolic screeds denouncing Paul Ryan for his treachery and threatening members of the Freedom Caucus with primary challenges . ( And since those Freedom Caucus members were elected by the Tea Party those threats have some serious bite . ) Talk Radio is boiling over with angry denunciations of Washington . Rush Limbaugh 's show last week illustrates their anger with a rant his website called `` GOP Sells America Down the River '' :\n[ T ] he Republicans have the largest number of seats in the House they 've had in Congress since the Civil War . And it has n't made any difference at all . It is as though Nancy Pelosi is still running the House and Harry Reid is still running the Senate . `` Betrayed '' is not even the word here . What has happened here is worse than betrayal . Betrayal is pretty bad , but it 's worse than that . This was out-and-out , in-our-face lying , from the campaigns to individual statements made about the philosophical approach Republicans had to all this spending . There is no Republican Party ! You know , we do n't even need a Republican Party if they 're gon na do this . You know , just elect Democrats , disband the Republican Party , and let the Democrats run it , because that 's what 's happening anyway ...\nHe was n't the only one . The entire activist base of the GOP is having an extended tantrum over this . They are now even comparing Paul Ryan to the hated Obama by calling him a Muslim \u2014 for growing a beard . The only reason it is n't a bigger story is that Congress is n't in session and the Trump Show is sucking all the energy out of everything else . ( Rush actually begged Trump to add a criticism of this Omnibus `` sell-out '' to his repertoire of immigrant and Muslim hate-mongering . )\nThe `` betrayal '' in this case refers to the annual failure to end Obamacare and the continuance of the program for Syrian refugees . But the one item that has them apoplectic is continued funding for Planned Parenthood . And there 's good reason for the agitation : The social conservatives are in total revolt . And that is a big problem for the GOP , which depends upon the evangelical churches to get out the vote .\nAntiabortion activists were given to understand by Republican leaders that the Planned Parenthood doctored videos had changed the game on abortion rights and they believed the party would succeed in ending all federal funding for the organization . They are livid that they were misled . As Sean Illing of \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last week , Franklin Graham , the son of Billy Graham and highly respected leader of the Christian right , announced that he was leaving the Republican Party . In a fiery Facebook post he wrote :\nAfter all of the appalling facts revealed this year about Planned Parenthood , our representatives in Washington had a chance to put a stop to this , but they didn \u2019 t . There \u2019 s no question\u2014taxpayers should not be paying for abortions ! Abortion is murder in God \u2019 s eyes . Seeing and hearing Planned Parenthood talk nonchalantly about selling baby parts from aborted fetuses with utter disregard for human life is reminiscent of Joseph Mengele and the Nazi concentration camps ! That should \u2019 ve been all that was needed to turn off the faucet for their funding ... This is an example of why I have resigned from the Republican Party and declared myself Independent .\nLast summer when the videos first surfaced , with ample input from conservative members of Congress , the congressional leadership knew they had a problem on their hands . They did not want to shut down the government again before the election . Despite the erroneous belief among the rank and file that government shutdowns automatically lead to victory , these seasoned polls understand that presidential elections are different than midterms and that they could be taking a huge chance in not only losing the White House again but also their congressional majority if they engage in another dangerous game of chicken .

The latest AP Poll released on Dec. 22 shows that the antiabortion base 's extreme positions are out of step with a majority of Americans : 58 percent of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in most or all cases while 39 percent say it should be illegal in most or all cases .
