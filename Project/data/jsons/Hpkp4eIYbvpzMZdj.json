We simply can \u2019 t take such a risk . If North Korea demands the talks be on Kim \u2019 s home court , President Trump needs to say there won \u2019 t be talks .\nNext , President Trump must make it clear to Kim that there will be no letup in planned U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise set for the end of this month . As North Korea has trained its army all winter long , Washington and Seoul must be afforded that same right .
