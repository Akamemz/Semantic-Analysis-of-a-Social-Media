I made this decision after much discussion with my wife Rosemary ; my son Sean ; and my daughter Erin . The prime reason for my decision was that after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington , D.C. , it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford , '' King wrote on his Facebook page . `` This was not an easy decision . But there is a season for everything and Rosemary and I decided that , especially since we are both in good health , it is time to have the flexibility to spend more time with our children and grandchildren .
