    "content": "As always , a presidential tweet raises the obvious question . Tweeted the President :\n\u201c It \u2019 s very sad that Republicans , even some that were carried over the line on my back , do very little to protect their President . \u201d\n\u201c So why aren \u2019 t the Committees and investigators , and of course our beleaguered A.G. , looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations ? \u201d\nAnd the President isn \u2019 t the only one wondering where the GOP investigators are . Appearing on Fox News Monday , former Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz made the same point , saying :\nRepublicans need to get a backbone . Every time the Democrats say they need to call up Jared Kushner or Don Jr. \u2014 call up Chelsea Clinton , call up the Clintons . There we have an inspector general who issues a report stating an actual crime . You have Bill Clinton , the former president , taking millions and millions of dollars from countries , that Hillary Clinton is going in and then doing business . So every time a Democrat says \u201c I got ta talk to Donald Trump Jr. , \u201d then go up and bring Chelsea Clinton in there , because she was involved in the Benghazi situation , she was involved with the ( Clinton ) Foundation .\nChaffetz added the obvious about some of these \u201c investigators. \u201d \u201c They would never , ever , ever do this to the Clintons. \u201d Exactly .\nLet \u2019 s be clear . There was no Trump collusion with Russians to steal the election . It didn \u2019 t happen . And making every contact with a Russian this-or-that into some sort of grand theft of democracy is ridiculous on its face . Recall that after making a big deal about Jared Kushner or then-Senator Jeff Sessions meeting with the Russian Ambassador , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was asked the same question \u2014 had she ever met with the Russian Ambassador ? \u201c Not this one \u201d was her reply \u2014 only to have someone produce a photo of her taking a meeting with , yes indeed , the current Russian ambassador . Does this mean Pelosi lied ? Does this mean she was conspiring to steal the election with Russian help ? This is ridiculous .\nBut that hasn \u2019 t stopped Democrats from demanding \u2014 and getting \u2014 a \u201c special counsel \u201d to investigate the President . After the latter was personally told by then-FBI Director Comey that he wasn \u2019 t under investigation . And in true special prosecutor style , mission creep has already taken over the Robert Mueller investigation . What began as an investigation of Trump-Russian \u201c collusion \u201d to steal an election has now mission-creeped into a demand to look at the President \u2019 s finances . Headlined Bloomberg :\nThe U.S. special counsel investigating possible ties between the Donald Trump campaign and Russia in last year \u2019 s election is examining a broad range of transactions involving Trump \u2019 s businesses as well as those of his associates , according to a person familiar with the probe . FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings , Trump \u2019 s involvement in a controversial SoHo development in New York with Russian associates , the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump \u2019 s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 , the person said .\nGot that ? We have now gone from investigating whether Trump colluded with the Russians to steal the election to nosing into the sale of apartments to Russians years ago ? Votes for condos is the idea ? Seriously ? This investigation is out of control already .\nThis news coming on the heels of the realization that Mueller has staffed up with Clinton supporters , including one lawyer tied to the Clinton Foundation itself .\nThe question here is : Where are the Republicans ? Where are the demands to Mueller that if he is to expanding his Russia investigation then it \u2019 s past time to bring in the Clintons and investigate the pay-to-play use of the Clinton Foundation , that expensive Bill Clinton speech in Moscow , and the use of the State Department as the ultimate pay-to-play Clinton toy .\nNewsflash : Democrats and their media allies are playing hardball . They don \u2019 t want a debate on health care or taxes , they want to delegitimize and overthrow a duly elected President of the United States because they still can \u2019 t believe they lost the last election . Of all the people to finally come to grips with this reality , there was this from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer :\nSchumer : Dems , not Russia , are to blame for loss to Trump\n\u201c When you lose to somebody who has 40 percent popularity , you don \u2019 t blame other things \u2014 Comey , Russia \u2014 you blame yourself , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said in an interview previewing the new plan . \u201c So what did we do wrong ? People didn \u2019 t know what we stood for , just that we were against Trump . And still believe that . \u201d\nBut the GOP on Capitol Hill ? Here is Speaker Ryan per the Hill newspaper :\nSpeaker Ryan : Mueller is \u2018 anything but \u2019 a Dem partisan Speaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) on Monday defended special counsel Robert Mueller , who is leading the Justice Department \u2019 s investigation into the Russia election interference , saying he \u2019 s \u201c anything but \u201d a Democratic partisan . \u201c I don \u2019 t think many people are saying Bob Mueller is a biased partisan . He \u2019 s really , sort of , anything but , \u201d Ryan said on the Wisconsin-based radio program \u201c The Jay Weber Show , \u201d which the Washington Examiner highlighted .\nIf true , how does the Speaker explain this from the Washington Free Beacon :\nMueller Hires Multiple Hillary Clinton Donors for Special Counsel Team Special counsel Robert Mueller has hired multiple donors who gave to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign to join his team investigating President Donald Trump . Federal records show that three attorneys who Mueller hired have made political donations , mostly to Democrats , CNN reports . Two of them gave the maximum contribution to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign , while another donated to former President Barack Obama \u2019 s 2008 campaign and the Democratic National Committee . Trump \u2019 s supporters have begun casting doubt on the impartiality of Mueller and his team . Prominent Trump backer Newt Gingrich tweeted Monday that Mueller was unlikely to be fair .\nAs if that weren \u2019 t bad enough ? Recall this from Breitbart :\nSwamp Fights Back : Mueller Hires Clinton Foundation Lawyer for Russia Probe A more controversial pick of Mueller \u2019 s was former prosecutor and WilmerHale partner Jeannie Rhee . In 2015 , according to Politico , she performed work for the Clinton Foundation , defending it from FOIA requests related to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s private email server . These developments have raised some red flags on the right . For example , Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News , \u201c This is going to be a witch hunt . \u201d\nOver at the Daily Caller there was more from that Speaker Ryan radio interview . The incredible headline : Ryan :\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan said Monday that it isn \u2019 t congressional Republicans \u2019 role to defend President Trump from the investigations into Russian election interference\u2026\nHere is Rush Limbaugh \u2019 s take on all of this on his Monday show , bold print for emphasis mine :\nWhat Trump is talking about here is : Why aren \u2019 t these Republican committees , why aren \u2019 t these Republican investigators \u2014 why isn \u2019 t my attorney general \u2014 looking into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s crimes ? If you \u2019 re gon na investigate what-all went on with Russia , how in the world do you leave the Democrats out of it ? How do you leave Hillary Clinton out of it ? The Republicans run the show ! It \u2019 s time for the Republicans to start acting like it . Politics is what it is . The Republicans don \u2019 t appear to want to play the game.\u2026 We can come up with all the guesses ( and we would be right eight out of 10 times ) why they \u2019 re not investigating Hillary , why they are not investigating the Democrats \u2019 connection with the Russians . By the way , there \u2019 s new news out today that the FBI did get hold of some computer equipment from Debbie \u201c Blabbermouth \u201d Schultz \u2019 s IT guy that they would not turn over to the FBI . There \u2019 s a potential gold mine there to be investigated of Hillary and the Democrats and the Democrat National Committee , and there just doesn \u2019 t seem ( that we know of , anyway ) to be any energy to uncover it . All of the energy seems to be focused on getting Trump and getting rid of Trump \u2014 which I , of course , am not denying that they want to do that . We \u2019 ve chronicled it here . But an opportunity is being squandered the likes of which ( chuckles ) we never thought we were gon na get . We hoped for it , and it probably is not something we could reasonably expect happen again . If it does , it \u2019 s only because the Democrats are so hapless .\nSpeaker Gingrich , as always , gets the deal on the spot . This is a witch-hunt designed to bring down the President . The presence of all those Clinton or Obama lawyers on the Mueller staff and the resulting lack of an investigation into the Clintons is no accident . Period . Who bought what Trump apartment years ago or the existence of a beauty pageant in Moscow in 2013 is utterly unrelated to the as-it-is bogus allegation that somehow Russians gave the election to Trump . But the Clinton Foundation-State Department-Clinton campaign Russia ties ? And a blind eye is turned ?\nAll of this and the GOP on Capitol Hill just turns away ? With no less than Speaker Ryan saying , as in the words of the Daily Caller , \u201c that it isn \u2019 t congressional Republicans \u2019 role to defend President Trump . \u201d\nExcuse me ?
