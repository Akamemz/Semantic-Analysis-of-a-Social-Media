    "content": "The Trump administration is barreling ahead in its high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with North Korea even though it lacks a full-time envoy to oversee the negotiations .\nCurrently , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is serving as the point man on the administration \u2019 s effort to convince North Korea to give up its atomic arsenal . But some lawmakers and former officials are urging President Donald Trump to put a special representative in charge , arguing that Pompeo can \u2019 t give the topic the explicit , sustained attention it requires .\nThe calls for an envoy come as Trump aides remain coy about details of their strategy to deal with the isolated Asian country . There have been no formal talks announced since Trump held a much-ballyhooed June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un , although there are reports that Pompeo will go next week to Pyongyang .\nKim \u2019 s regime , meanwhile , is reported to have upgraded a nuclear facility and stepped up its production of fuel for nuclear weapons , raising questions about its true intentions .\n\u201c This is like going to the World Series with nobody in the bullpen , \u201d said New York Rep. Eliot Engel , the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee . \u201c To address a challenge the magnitude of North Korea , the United States needs an empowered secretary of state and a competent and resourced diplomatic staff to back him up \u2014 especially a top official dealing exclusively with North Korea . \u201d\nUntil recently , the U.S. had a special representative for North Korea policy : Joseph Yun , a respected career Foreign Service officer . Yun announced his retirement in late February , just weeks before Trump upended diplomatic convention and agreed to meet with Kim , a brutal dictator who has expanded North Korea \u2019 s nuclear arsenal .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

Ambassador to the Philippines Sung Kim , was tasked with helping plan the summit . Ultimately , State , with Pompeo at the helm , coordinated with the National Security Council , the CIA and other agencies to pull off the June 12 Trump-Kim meeting , held in Singapore .\nThe meeting resulted in a vague U.S.-North Korea statement committing to denuclearization , but few specifics . The hard work lies ahead , analysts say , as the two sides hammer out what they mean by denuclearization , the timeframes involved , what the U.S. will give Pyongyang and more . It could be many months before a comprehensive nuclear deal is reached .\nPompeo , who took over as secretary of state in late April , assured lawmakers this week that people across the government are working on the steps ahead . He said he is charge of the inter-agency effort , but he declined to detail the U.S. strategy for the talks , saying that could be \u201c counterproductive . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 re watching this hearing , \u201d he said of the North Koreans .\nThere \u2019 s no doubt U.S. officials have kept busy on the North Korea front . Pompeo this week spoke with his counterpart in South Korea , while Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has raised the issue on a swing through Asia , with stops in Beijing , Seoul and Tokyo . The Senate on Thursday also finally confirmed a U.S. ambassador to South Korea , filling what many analysts said was a glaring hole in the Trump administration \u2019 s approach to the nuclear issue .\nBut while Pompeo is considered a smart , versatile player \u2014 with special insight into North Korea from his time as CIA chief \u2014 he is still new to diplomacy and has limited knowledge of nuclear technicalities . Kim , on the other hand , is likely to dispatch highly experienced negotiators for future discussions \u2014 delegates who will wrestle with every word of any deal .\nAs the chief U.S. diplomat , Pompeo also has plenty of other crises to tackle , including escalating U.S. tensions with Iran , fraying U.S.-European ties , and general global discontent with Trump \u2019 s trade and environmental policies .\n\u201c At the stage of the game , the appointment of a senior U.S. envoy dedicated to [ the North Korea ] process would make a great deal of sense , \u201d said Suzanne DiMaggio of the New America think tank . \u201c The next weeks and months will be critical , and it \u2019 s difficult to see how Pompeo can devote the day-to-day attention needed to keep things moving forward . \u201d\nAsked if the administration plans to fill the special envoy \u2019 s position , the State Department said it had \u201c no personnel announcements at this time. \u201d Yun , who is now with the U.S. Institute of Peace , did not respond to requests for comment .\nSung Kim , who previously held the North Korea role , would be an obvious choice , but his current job as the U.S. ambassador in Manila is also important , especially given the authoritarian antics of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte . He did not respond to a request for comment .\nEvans Revere , a retired Foreign Service officer with extensive North Korea knowledge , said that if Trump wishes to name an envoy , \u201c it will have to be a person of considerable gravitas , very high rank and be someone who can speak authoritatively on behalf of the president . \u201d\n\u201c If we have learned nothing else after over a quarter of a century of dealing with the North Koreans on the nuclear issue , if you are not directly engaged with [ North Korea \u2019 s ] leader and his inner circle , you are almost certainly wasting your time , \u201d Revere said .\nEarlier this week , researchers with the group 38 North released satellite images that they said indicated North Korea was improving the infrastructure at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center \u201c at a rapid pace. \u201d The upgrades included modifying a cooling system and construction on support facilities .\nOn Friday evening , NBC News , citing U.S. officials familiar with intelligence assessments , reported that even as Washington and Pyongyang were engaged in diplomacy , North Korea was increasing its production of enriched uranium , a key fuel for nuclear weapons .\nThe news was unsettling given North Korea \u2019 s past failure to meet nuclear commitments , adding to concerns that Kim has no genuine interest in relinquishing his program now that he \u2019 s raised his global profile by meeting with Trump . It also ran counter to Trump \u2019 s claim , in a tweet shortly after he met Kim , that \u201c there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s decision to meet Kim at the start of the process was highly unusual . Although there \u2019 s no universal model for international nuclear negotiations , such diplomatic processes tend to start with lower-level aides working out specifics \u2014 such as the number of centrifuges a country can have \u2014 before higher-level officials come in to seal the deal .\nOne key task for U.S. officials now is figuring out what model of negotiations the two sides can live with , and whether the North Koreans are serious about giving up their nuclear program , former officials and analysts said . Given those unknowns , delaying the appointment of a special envoy may not be a bad thing , said Christopher Hill , who led the U.S. delegation during a previous round of nuclear talks with North Korea under President George W. Bush .\n\u201c For now , before they have any really sense of what they have from the North Koreans , it is probably best that Pompeo is his own envoy , albeit with a team , \u201d Hill said . \u201c He has the senior relationships , including with the president . If they get real traction , that is when they should name someone . \u201d\nLawmakers are also trying to shape the process . This week , Sens . Bob Menendez , a Democrat from New Jersey , and Cory Gardner , a Republican from Colorado , introduced a bill laying out broad desires for what a deal with Pyongyang will look like , while requiring the president to submit to Congress reports on the negotiation strategy and outcomes . The legislation challenges Trump \u2019 s stated confidence about the talks so far .\n\u201c This is not reality TV , \u201d a senior Democratic Senate aide said . \u201c And thus far the president hasn \u2019 t demonstrated that he is serious or capable of doing this right , or even that he understands the basics of how to keep our allies at the center of our policy or how to effectively exercise leverage . \u201d\nOne of Pompeo \u2019 s ongoing challenges is dealing with the concerns of U.S. allies , in particular Japan and South Korea , who also are deeply invested in denuclearization of North Korea .\nPompeo spoke to South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha on Thursday , and the two \u201c agreed that pressure must continue until [ North Korea ] denuclearizes , \u201d according to a State Department readout of the call . The conversation came the same day the Senate confirmed retired Navy Adm. Harry Harris as the U.S. ambassador to South Korea , filling a position that \u2019 s been vacant since Trump took office . Pompeo also spoke Thursday to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi , urging Beijing to continue enforcing sanctions on North Korea .\nMattis offered his own assurances on a trip to the region this week , meeting with top Chinese , South Korean and Japanese officials . Japan and South Korea have been especially concerned because the Pentagon , at Trump \u2019 s order following his talks with Kim , has suspended some joint military exercises with South Korea .\nThe Trump-Kim statement issued June 12 committed both countries to \u201c hold follow-on negotiations , led by the U.S. Secretary of State , Mike Pompeo , and a relevant high-level [ North Korean ] official , at the earliest possible date . \u201d\nBut , nearly three weeks since Trump and Kim met , the State Department has not officially announced any North Korea-related travel plans for Pompeo . Officials at the department would not confirm reports Pompeo will be in Pyongyang next week .\nIf Pompeo goes to North Korea again soon , \u201c that \u2019 s a good sign , \u201d said Joel Wit , a former State Department official who has negotiated with the Pyongyang regime . \u201c If you don \u2019 t see him going in the next two weeks , you \u2019 ve got to start scratching your head . \u201d\nIn an interview with CNN published this week Pompeo refused to submit to any timeframe for the talks , despite saying a few weeks ago that the U.S. hopes to see \u201c major disarmament \u201d of North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program by the end of Trump \u2019 s first term .\n\u201c I am not going to put a timeline on it , \u201d Pompeo told CNN , \u201c whether that \u2019 s two months , six months , we are committed to moving forward in an expeditious moment to see if we can achieve what both leaders set out to do . \u201d",
