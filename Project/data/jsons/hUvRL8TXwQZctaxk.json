There is nothing to suggest the gradient has become any less steep .\nBloomberg continues to toy with a bid , but it is enormously difficult to see a credible route for the former New York City mayor , despite his vast fortune .\nBloomberg \u2019 s business-friendly centrism seems a poor fit for today \u2019 s Democratic Party , and he is far from a natural politician on the stump , which would hinder him in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire .",
