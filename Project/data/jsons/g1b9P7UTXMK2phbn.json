McMaster or John Kelly or David Shulkin or Ryan Zinke could be out by the end of the day . It 's not that those are n't fair journalistic pursuits\u2014and not that I have n't done similar stories like that in my career\u2014but in this White House , it 's like nailing Jell-O to the wall .\nHere 's what Swan wrote : `` We can tell you that Trump has been putting on a heck of an act privately in the past two days , if he really does have all these elaborate plans that are being attributed to him .\n`` Here 's all we really know : Trump is in the mood for change , and there 's a long list of people he 's been fed up with for a while . ''\n`` That 's it . As far as when they might go , and who might replace them , serious people are in the dark . Trump floats ideas all the time , and often nothing comes of them .

They know they could be embarrassed in the next two hours because their boss is so mercurial . ''\nSwan says he tries to be `` hyper-cautious '' and , as a scoop artist himself , `` I do n't pretend I 'm some bastion of glory . But there 's only so many times you can write that H.R .

What 's the reader to think when he reads it for the 16th time ? ''\nIt \u2019 s easy to dismiss all this as palace intrigue , and there is a media fixation on who 's up and who 's down .
