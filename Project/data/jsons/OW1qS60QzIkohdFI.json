Trump backers suggest it 's not Read more\nInstead , he fired up his loyal army of followers by repeating the threat he made directly to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s face at the second presidential debate on Sunday night that once ensconced in the White House he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her alleged crimes .\nWhen the baying crowd at Mohegan Sun Arena shouted \u201c Lock her up ! \u201d , Trump shot back at them : \u201c Lock her up is right ! \u201d\nBut in his effervescent post-debate mood he merely succeeded in generating further controversy . He praised the group that acted as conduit for one of the biggest leaks of US government secrets in history : \u201c WikiLeaks , I love WikiLeaks , \u201d he said .\nAnd he also managed to adopt an erroneous report by a Russian government-sponsored news agency relating to a recent WikiLeaks stash of documents hacked from the emails of Clinton \u2019 s campaign chairman , John Podesta .\nTrump , reading from an account of the document dump , told his supporters at the Wilkes-Barre rally that Clinton \u2019 s longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal \u2013 \u201c Sleazy Sidney \u201d as he called him \u2013 had sent an email to Podesta in which Blumenthal said it was legitimate to question whether Clinton had failed to protect American personnel in Benghazi , Libya , in 2012 , when she was US secretary of state .\n\u201c In other words , [ Blumenthal \u2019 s ] now admitting they could have done something about Benghazi , \u201d Trump said , prompting loud reproaches from the crowd .\nDonald Trump and Russia : a web that grows more tangled all the time Read more\nIn fact , the claim that Clinton had something to answer for over the death of the US ambassador in Benghazi was made by a Newsweek journalist in an article that Blumenthal had emailed to Podesta , as the author of the magazine piece promptly pointed out . The conflation of the Newsweek quotes and Blumenthal appears to have been extracted by Trump from an inaccurate account of the WikiLeaks documents reported by the Russian online news outlet Sputnik .\nThe botched attack on Clinton and Blumenthal could backfire for Trump given that he has already been accused by his Democratic rival of being overly complimentary about the Russian leader Vladimir Putin . Last Friday the Obama administration claimed that the WikiLeaks documents had been hacked from Democrats \u2019 email accounts by the Russian government in an attempt to sway the US presidential election .\nThough Trump avoided talking about the groping tape in Wilkes-Barre , at an earlier rally in Ambridge , Pennsylvania , he did renew his line of defence that his 2005 bragging about being able to kiss and grab the genitals of women was only \u201c locker room talk \u201d . One of his leading surrogates , the former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , went further by turning the issue into a joke .\nDuring a warm-up speech at the Wilkes-Barre rally , Giuliani made a quip about it during an attack on Clinton . He said : \u201c Boy , she is as phony as \u2026 I better not say , as I have to be nice . I might say it back in the locker room . \u201d\nIn his Wilkes-Barre speech , Trump pressed all the familiar buttons that have by now become a mainstay of his insurrectionary campaign .

The Republican candidate also appeared to believe that his openly hostile stance towards Clinton in the presidential debate \u2013 in which he threatened her with jail , interrupted her and jabbed his fingers at her multiple times , and stood ominously behind her when she was talking \u2013 had put the calamity of the groping scandal behind him .\nSo ebullient did he appear on stage on Monday night that he even took a toddler from his parents \u2019 arms and carried him on to the stage .
