It seems that nothing he does erodes his support . His voters are loyal , that \u2019 s for sure .\nIf you want to understand the Trump phenomenon and the durability of his campaign , you have to understand his voters and how they get their information . Many on the left mistakenly think that Trump supporters are \u201c low-information voters. \u201d Nothing could be further from the truth . Actually , it \u2019 s the opposite . They consume a lot of news and information , and almost all of it comes from their most trusted source -- Matt Drudge .\nMatt Drudge is all in for Trump , and he is making sure that his millions of daily readers are getting the news .\nDrudge , of course , is the owner of the popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report , a site that records approximately 2 million unique visitors a day with about 700 million page views per month . His readers are loyal , too . A 2014 Pew Research Center study found that the Drudge Report is among the most trusted news sources among conservatives , while most mainstream media outlets register a very high level of distrust from that group .\nHis loyal readers don \u2019 t trust information coming from other sources , and that allows Drudge to carefully curate links to articles that help to further his pro-Trump point of view among that audience . The most pro-Trump conservative news site is Breitbart.com . Breitbart is so pro-Trump that some have charged that the Breitbart company is being paid by Trump for favorable coverage . The truth is that Breitbart \u2019 s loyalty is more to Drudge than it is to Trump .\nBreitbart was founded by the late Andrew Breitbart , who was the Drudge Report \u2019 s first employee . He founded the Breitbart news site after leaving the Drudge Report , but remained personally and professionally close to Drudge . The Breitbart site established itself quickly as the go-to news source for grass-roots anti-establishment conservatives , with an assist from Drudge who regularly posted Breitbart article links on the Drudge Report . Over the years , the Drudge Report has directed millions and millions of readers to Breitbart stories .\nIt \u2019 s not hard to find evidence of Drudge \u2019 s success in gaining his audience \u2019 s support of Trump . Trump has won every post-debate online poll of Drudge Report readers -- by a lot . Those polls attract hundreds of thousands of votes . After the last GOP debate more than 350,000 votes were registered and Donald Trump won 43 percent , followed by Ted Cruz with 27 percent . That audience loyalty is translating into strong support for Trump in the public scientific polls , too . Thanks to Drudge , Trump has led the GOP field nationally since July .\nThe loyalty and respect go both ways -- Trump goes out of his way to praise Drudge and mention his victories in the Drudge polls at every opportunity .\nWhy is Matt Drudge working to elect Donald Trump president ? I haven \u2019 t asked him , but it \u2019 s not hard to connect the dots .\nFirst , Drudge has a right-of-center point of view and describes himself as \u201c more of a populist. \u201d Trump \u2019 s campaign is clearly tapping into that conservative anti-establishment populism that \u2019 s been fueling the energy on the right in recent years . Drudge is primarily responsible for fanning the flames of that sentiment . He helped to build the Tea Party movement and is a constant thorn in the side of establishment Republicans in Washington .\nThe immigration issue is another example of Trump \u2019 s direct connection to Drudge . An opponent of immigration reform and \u201c amnesty \u201d for undocumented immigrants , Drudge has made it his top priority in recent years . His coverage of that issue has been credited with killing the \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d legislation in Washington , and even leading to the primary defeat of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , R-Va .\nOf course , Trump has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign and he credits best-selling author and conservative provocateur Ann Coulter \u2019 s new book , `` Adios America , '' with shaping his view on that issue . Coulter and Drudge are close friends . In fact , they were seen sitting together in the audience at last week \u2019 s Republican debate on CNN . She even dedicated one of her many bestsellers to Drudge .\nIn addition to being anti-establishment and anti-immigration , Drudge is also famously anti-Clinton , both Bill and Hillary . The success of his site is a direct result of the attention he garnered when he broke the Monica Lewinsky story back in 1998 . It put him on the political map . Since then , he \u2019 s unmatched in the distribution of anti-Clinton stories and rumors .\nAll of those things have enabled Drudge to cultivate the perfect audience for the time , and they are ready to engage in an epic battle . Matt Drudge \u2019 s dream 2016 presidential match-up is his anti-establishment , anti-immigration populist Donald Trump against his favorite target , Hillary Clinton . He \u2019 s going to do everything he can to make that dream come true by making sure that his sizable audience stays loyal to Donald Trump in the primary . So far , so good for Drudge .",
