The case was heard in early December, after being returned to the Supreme Court for a second go-round. In 2013, the justices demanded tougher judicial scrutiny of the school's use of race, but an appeals court again sided with UT.\n\nUnlike the other cases, this one will be decided by just seven justices, because Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself after working on it as U.S. solicitor general. Without the risk of a tie, advocates and opponents of affirmative action anticipate a ruling for or against the policy \u2014 perhaps with repercussions for other universities as well. The betting line tilts slightly against UT.\n\nSupreme Court skeptical of racial preferences in university admissions\n\nAbortion\n\nAnother case from Texas challenges a state law that imposed major restrictions on abortion clinics, ostensibly to protect women's health. The law requires clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and forces doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals \u2014 rules that threaten to leave only nine fully functioning abortion clinics in a state with 5.4 million women of reproductive age.\n\nTwo lower federal courts have upheld the law, but abortion rights proponents say it places too great a burden on women seeking abortions, without a justifiable health benefit.

It represents his last chance to help the parents of those brought to the country as children who have already won such a reprieve.\n\nTexas led a group of 26 states against the plan, complaining that it would have to pay for driver's licenses if the parents dodge deportation proceedings. Obama's best chance appears to be the hope that a majority of justices will decide the cost of licenses does not give Texas sufficient standing in court.
