Hanen \u2019 s decision , but it \u2019 s unclear whether the case could reach the circuit court in New Orleans or even the Supreme Court before Wednesday , which is when the Homeland Security Department had planned to begin accepting the first applications under the new amnesty .\n\u201c The DHS was not given any \u2018 discretion by law \u2019 to give 4.3 million removable aliens what the DHS itself labels as \u2018 legal presence , \u2019 \u201d Judge Hanen wrote in issuing an injunction . \u201c In fact , the law mandates that these illegally-present individuals be removed . The DHS has adopted a new rule that substantially changes both the status and employability of millions . These changes go beyond mere enforcement or even non-enforcement of this nation \u2019 s immigration scheme . \u201d\nIn the immediate sense , the ruling will become a major part of the debate over homeland security funding that has roiled Capitol Hill , with Republicans insisting Mr. Obama \u2019 s actions were unconstitutional and should be halted through Congress \u2019 s spending power , and Democrats backing their president by filibustering to block funding for the Homeland Security Department altogether .\nThe ruling doesn \u2019 t mean those illegal immigrants are going to be deported immediately \u2014 indeed , Judge Hanen said they are likely not to be deported at all under Mr. Obama , who had set \u201c priorities \u201d putting them in little danger of ever being kicked out of the country , even without the formal amnesty .\nThe judge said Mr. Obama does have the right to set those priorities , but said it is likely a step too far for him to have set up a proactive program to grant them other benefits .\n\u201c The DHS may continue to prosecute or not prosecute these illegally-present individuals , as current laws dictate .
