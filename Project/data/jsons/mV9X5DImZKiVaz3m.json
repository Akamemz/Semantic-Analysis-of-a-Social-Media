Cruz won at least 65 of the 94 delegates up for grabs Saturday ( he may have won more than 65 , but Kentucky \u2019 s 25 delegates haven \u2019 t revealed their leanings ) . The Texas senator has so thoroughly dominated the fight to send loyalists to the national convention that if front-runner Donald Trump fails to clinch the nomination on the first ballot , Cruz is well-positioned to surpass him \u2014 and perhaps even snag the nomination for himself \u2014 when delegates are free in subsequent convention rounds to vote for whomever they want . On Saturday , he nearly won 19 of 20 seats available in Maine , losing just one to a Trump backer : Gov . Paul LePage . He also won all nine delegates on the ballot in three Minnesota congressional districts , picking up support in the lone state won by Marco Rubio [ beyond Puerto Rico and DC ] . Cruz also grabbed one of three delegates in South Carolina \u2019 s 6th Congressional District , while the other two went to an uncommitted delegate and a supporter of Ohio Gov . John Kasich .

The Cruz and Kasich campaigns have announced a strategic partnership to deny delegates to polarizing frontrunner Donald Trump , with the Ohio Governor effectively pulling out of Indiana -- which should redound to Cruz 's benefit ( see polling numbers below ) -- and the Texas Senator ceding Oregon and New Mexico to Kasich . Here 's the Cruz camp 's statement , with Team Kasich confirming their end of the bargain in a separate press release .

This is true , though caveats are beginning to apply : Correct . Trump was always expected to win big in his home state of New York , which he did . He 's also seen as the odds-on favorite to sweep five northeastern blue states ( in which the GOP ticket stands no change in the fall ; see below ) tomorrow night . Those outcomes have been baked into the expectations cake -- and analysts ' delegate math -- for weeks . They do n't shape the trajectory of the race , insofar as the drive to 1,237 is concerned .

A Trump win there would deal a serious blow to Cruz , especially if new polling out of California is even close to accurate . We 've told you about Cruz 's enormous organizational edge on the ground in the Golden State -- but out-hustling and out-working your opponent can only get you so far if you 're down by 20 or more points , and when that advantage spans the state 's various regions . If the Fox News ' Indiana and California numbers hold up ( and that 's still a big if ) , then there 's a very legitimate chance that Trump solidifies his delegate majority before Cleveland .
