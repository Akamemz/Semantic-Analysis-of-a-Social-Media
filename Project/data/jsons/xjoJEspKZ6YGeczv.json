Instead, this case tests whether voters can ban affirmative action programs through a referendum.\n\nIn 2003, the high court upheld the University of Michigan Law School's affirmative action policy. The next day, opponents of affirmative action launched a referendum campaign to bar such programs, and in 2006, voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative amending the state constitution to ban affirmative action programs in higher education.\n\nMichigan's state colleges and universities promptly abandoned any use of race or ethnicity to promote diversity, and minority enrollment plummeted. In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled that the referendum itself was discriminatory, and the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in to decide the issue.\n\nIn recent years, the court's conservative majority has become increasingly skeptical of race-based policies. As Chief Justice John Roberts put it in a 2007 opinion, \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" (Parents Involved v. Seattle School District)\n\n'Equal Treatment' Or 'Separate And Unequal'?\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette contends that is exactly what the state's voters did. \"What the Michigan citizens did and said in a vote, by 58 percent of the people, is that it's wrong to treat people different on the basis of your race or color of your skin,\" he says. \"That's what this case is about \u2014 equal treatment.\"\n\nBut opponents of the referendum claim that the ballot initiative rigged the system. They note that other state admissions policies are set by the popularly elected boards of regents of the three state universities. Indeed, affirmative action defenders observe that some regent elections have focused on the issue of affirmative action.

Those decisions established the \"political process doctrine\" and struck down state referenda that the court said targeted racial minorities. In one case, for example, the state referendum prohibited a local busing program that was used to desegregate schools.\n\nSchuette, however, calls the political process doctrine \"somewhat antiquated\" and asserts that, in any event, his state's referendum is different.\n\n\"Those other cases,\" Schuette says, \"removed a provision with respect to equal treatment under the law. We adopted something that requires equal treatment.\"\n\nThe elephant in the room in this case, of course, is the whole question of affirmative action in higher education.
