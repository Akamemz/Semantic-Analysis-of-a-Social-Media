    "content": "With private-sector unions badly weakened by factory shutdowns and corporate resistance to unions , government employee unions have become the most powerful part of the labor movement . That \u2019 s one reason anti-union billionaires and foundations underwrote the Janus litigation : to hobble the strongest part of labor . The Koch brothers and other billionaires have seized on Janus to finance efforts , through emails and door-to-door canvassing , to urge government workers \u2014 teachers , police , firefighters , social workers and many others \u2014 to quit their unions and stop paying union fees .\nIt doesn \u2019 t look as if Mr. Trump \u2019 s latest nominee to the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , will be a friend to workers or unions . In an astonishingly anti-worker opinion in a case involving a SeaWorld trainer killed by an orca whale , Mr. Kavanaugh wrote in 2014 that the Labor Department was wrong to fine SeaWorld . Dissenting in a 2-to-1 case , he suggested that the Labor Department should not \u201c paternalistically \u201d regulate the safety of SeaWorld \u2019 s trainers because they , like tiger tamers and bull riders , were sports and entertainment figures who accepted the risk of injury in hazardous businesses that usually regulated their own dangers . His opinion had echoes of 19th-century state court rulings that factory workers assumed the risk of injuries from machinery that cut off their hands .\nLabor unions might get a boost from Mr. Trump \u2019 s efforts to increase coal , steel and aluminum production and from his push to renegotiate Nafta to spur domestic auto production . The Trump administration and many unions hope those moves will bring back tens of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs . That could lift unions \u2019 ranks , but those gains would be a fraction of the losses expected from Janus . Some experts estimate that more than a million workers will quit their unions over the next few years as a result of that ruling .\nThere has been some good news for labor . A new Gallup Poll found that public approval for unions has reached its highest level in 15 years . Unions have scored some significant victories recently , especially among white collar workers : adjunct professors at many universities have unionized , and so have journalists at The Los Angeles Times , The Chicago Tribune , The New Yorker , HuffPost and Slate , and graduate teaching assistants at Harvard , Columbia , Brandeis and other universities . There have also been unionization gains among nurses and bus drivers as well as service-sector workers in Silicon Valley .\nThe labor movement in the United States is already far weaker than in any other major industrialized nation . Just one in 10 American workers belongs to a union , down from more than one in three in the 1950s . But in the face of decades of fierce employer resistance , compounded by the Trump administration \u2019 s hostility , unions are not making the gains they need to reverse their decline . If America \u2019 s unions don \u2019 t rebound , that will most likely mean even more income inequality and wage stagnation and even more control of the levers of power by corporations and wealthy donors .\nSteven Greenhouse was a labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times for 19 years .
