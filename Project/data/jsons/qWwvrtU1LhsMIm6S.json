    "content": "A federal appeals court refused to lift an injunction against President Obama \u2019 s deportation amnesty in a ruling Tuesday that delivers a second major legal setback to the administration and keeps millions of illegal immigrants on hold .\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sided with a lower court that ruled Mr. Obama probably broke the law in taking unilateral action last year to grant an amnesty from deportation . The three-judge panel , ruling 2-1 , shot down Mr. Obama \u2019 s hopes of quickly restarting the amnesty , and make it likely he \u2019 ll have to go to the Supreme Court to try to win his case .\nThe majority , Judges Jerry E. Smith and Jennifer Elrod , said the president \u2019 s new program , known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability , or DAPA , is a binding policy that should have gone through the usual public notice and comment period instead of being announced unilaterally by Mr. Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson late last year .\n\u201c We live in a nation governed by a system of checks and balances , and the president \u2019 s attempt to bypass the will of the American people was successfully checked again today , \u201d said Texas Gov . Greg Abbott , who , as his state \u2019 s attorney general last year , began the lawsuit challenging the new amnesty .\nTwenty-five states joined Texas in suing to halt the amnesty , arguing they would bear new costs in having to issue driver \u2019 s licenses to the illegal immigrants and provide health care and other services to them . The states said the president \u2019 s actions were unconstitutional or , at the very least , illegal .\nFirst a district court , and now a federal appeals court , have sided with Texas , serving as twin legal rebukes to Mr. Obama and his defenders , who had insisted the steps he took were consistent with the law and with previous presidents \u2019 actions .\nImmigrant rights advocates said they will keep fighting , and tried to cast both the district and appeals courts as legal outliers .\n\u201c We are on the right side of history , the right side of justice , \u201d said Marielena Hincapie , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center .\nThe rulings do not affect Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2012 amnesty for so-called Dreamers , which has already granted tentative legal status to more than 600,000 illegal immigrants , and it also doesn \u2019 t take away Mr. Obama \u2019 s ability to decline to deport illegal immigrants . That means none of the more than 4 million people in question are likely to be kicked out of the country .\nBut the judges have ruled that Mr. Obama can \u2019 t go further and grant many of those people an affirmative status carrying all sorts of benefits , including driver \u2019 s licenses , tax credits and preferential work status under the terms of Obamacare .\nImmigrant rights advocates challenged Mr. Obama to use his authority to halt all deportations until he can find a way to work with Congress on a new immigration law .\n\u201c We call on President Obama to immediately act on that power by halting all deportations until the day when our broken immigration system can be replaced by humane , rational policies that recognize the value and humanity of our immigrant community members , \u201d said Jessica Bansal , litigation director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network .\nThe judges \u2019 rulings hinged in large part on the findings of District Judge Andrew S. Hanen , who halted the program in February , just two days before it was to accept the first applications .\nJudge Hanen ruled that an earlier version of the amnesty , which Mr. Obama announced in 2012 and which applied to so-called young adult Dreamers , showed that the administration was approving most applications . Judge Hanen said that undercut Mr. Obama \u2019 s argument that he was showing discretion rather than issuing a binding policy .\nThe judges in the majority opinion Tuesday said Mr. Obama \u2019 s expansion appeared to be the same kind of policy , and would have serious effects on the states .\n\u201c DAPA modifies substantive rights and interests \u2014 conferring lawful presence on 500,000 illegal aliens in Texas forces the state to choose between spending millions of dollars to subsidize driver \u2019 s licenses and changing its law , \u201d the judges wrote .\nThe judges also said it would be unfair to illegal immigrants to let the program go into effect on the off chance it \u2019 s later ruled illegal or unconstitutional , because the government would then have a list of people who came forward but didn \u2019 t get status .\nThey also denied a government request to allow the amnesty to go into effect in the 24 states that didn \u2019 t sue , saying that it was critical to have a \u201c uniform \u201d rule on immigration , as the Constitution requires .\nJudge Stephen A.
