    "content": "Gabbard \u2019 s decision to drop out , announced March 19 , was long in the works . She had consistently averaged around 1 to 2 percent in national polls and performed poorly in primaries ; her candidacy largely served as a single-issue protest run against American military adventurism rather than a serious bid for the presidency . Her most notable moment , a devastating attack on California Sen. Kamala Harris \u2019 s record as a prosecutor in the CNN \u2019 s July debate , didn \u2019 t move the dial much in her favor . So on Thursday , March 19 , she dropped out and endorsed Joe Biden for president .\nThe irony is that Gabbard could have been a real contender . She \u2019 s a strong communicator with an interesting biography , an Iraq war veteran and the first Hindu member of Congress . Yet thanks to a series of choices she had made since getting elected to Congress in 2012 \u2014 most notably an inexplicable trip to Syria to meet the country \u2019 s murderous leader Bashar al-Assad \u2014 she managed to alienate herself from Democratic Party \u2019 s leadership and base . Her continued ties to a strange religious group called \u201c Science of Identity \u201d didn \u2019 t help matters either , nor did frequent clashes with the party elite during the 2020 campaign ( including filing a lawsuit against Hillary Clinton ) .\nThe result is that Gabbard \u2019 s campaign never had much of a chance : She was unable to play a significant role in the Democratic primary , even on her single issue of opposing wars of regime change , due to her past missteps . She stayed in the race for a long time , but accomplished very little .\nGabbard was once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party\nWhen Gabbard was first elected to Congress in 2012 amid an ocean of positive press , the Iraq War veteran seemed like a sure thing for a 2020 presidential run . Nancy Pelosi called her an \u201c emerging star \u201d ; MSNBC \u2019 s Rachel Maddow predicted she was \u201c on the fast track to being very famous . \u201d\nDuring her first campaign , she managed to successfully apologize for a history of anti-LGBT and anti-abortion stances , situating herself as an economic progressive and a critic of the Bush-era wars in the Middle East . The latter was particularly important , as she grounded her antiwar arguments in her personal experience witnessing the cost of war . This immunized her from the \u201c soft on terrorism \u201d charges so many Democrats have been afraid to receive , making her a powerful critic of \u201c nation building \u201d and \u201c wars of choice . \u201d\nAnother famous biracial Hawaiian politician , President Barack Obama , endorsed her congressional run . After her victory , Gabbard was given one of five vice chair positions on the Democratic National Committee , a sign of the party \u2019 s faith in her . Another rising star , then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker , told Vogue in 2013 that \u201c she \u2019 s one of the leading voices in the party now . \u201d\nA presidential campaign , then , should not have been so short-lived , even in a crowded field as crowded as the 2020 Democratic one . But the positions she took in Congress on foreign policy and various authoritarian leaders \u2014 particularly Syria \u2019 s Assad \u2014 were too much for the party to overcome .\nGabbard \u2019 s decline came in a peculiar fashion : She picked a series of high-profile fights with the Obama administration over foreign policy .\nIn 2015 , terrorism was arguably the biggest fight in American partisan politics . ISIS had just swept across northern Iraq , seizing control of the country \u2019 s second-largest city ; the Obama administration had launched a new war in Iraq to roll them back .\nRepublicans blamed Obama . One of the most common arguments from Republicans in the run-up to that year \u2019 s midterm election was that Obama refused to say the phrase \u201c radical Islam , \u201d arguing that the president \u2019 s commitment to political correctness was preventing him from identifying the root cause of jihadist violence : Islamist theology .\nVery few Democrats were willing to echo the Republican arguments on this front . Gabbard was an exception . As early as January 2015 , she started going on every cable channel that would have her \u2014 including Fox News \u2014 and bashing Obama \u2019 s policy on terrorism . She sounded indistinguishable from a Republican presidential candidate .\n\u201c What is so frustrating ... is that our administration refuses to recognize who our enemy is , \u201d she said in a January 2015 interview with CNN \u2019 s Wolf Blitzer . \u201c And unless and until that happens , then it \u2019 s impossible to come up with a strategy to defeat that enemy . We have to recognize that this is about radical Islam . \u201d\nThe problem with this argument , according to both the Obama administration and most terrorism experts , is that \u201c radical Islam \u201d paints with too broad a brush . The term implies that jihadist militants are part of a unified ideological movement rather than a series of discrete groups that are often at war with each other . It \u2019 s also insulting to the vast majority of Muslims around the world . President George W. Bush \u2019 s counterterrorism team refused to use it for these reasons .\nThis overwhelming focus on the threat from terrorism culminated in what \u2019 s now Gabbard \u2019 s most infamous policy position : quasi-support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , the dictator responsible for the outbreak of the Syrian civil war and the conflict \u2019 s worst atrocities .\nGabbard argued , along with a small minority of foreign policy analysts , that the best way to defeat ISIS in Syria was for the US to align itself with Assad \u2019 s regime . She argued that the US should cut funding to the rebels fighting Assad , even sponsoring a bill in Congress to cut off US support . In the fall of 2015 , when Russia began its bombing campaign in Syria , Gabbard celebrated it as a win for counterterrorism .\nBad enough US has not been bombing al-Qaeda/al-Nusra in Syria . But it \u2019 s mind-boggling that we protest Russia \u2019 s bombing of these terrorists . \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard ( @ TulsiGabbard ) October 1 , 2015\nIn fact , Russian forces were mostly targeting Syrian rebel groups overall rather than al-Qaeda-aligned rebel groups specifically . The goal was not narrow counterterrorism but rather defending a Russian-friendly regime that was ( at the time ) losing the war .\nBut there \u2019 s an internal logic here , one that the Kremlin itself has argued publicly . If you \u2019 re focused solely on the threat from the jihadist elements inside the Syrian opposition to the American homeland to the exclusion of moral concerns about Assad \u2019 s regime , then it makes a grim kind of sense to align oneself with the Syrian and Russian governments .\nThis appears to be how Gabbard , who once described Assad as \u201c brutal , \u201d could support Russia \u2019 s intervention on his behalf \u2014 even going so far as to unfavorably compare Obama to Putin , a stance that was always unpopular with Democrats but became political Kryptonite in the wake of Russia \u2019 s intervention in the 2016 election :\nAl-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and must be defeated . Obama won \u2019 t bomb them in Syria . Putin did . # neverforget911 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard ( @ TulsiGabbard ) October 1 , 2015\nIn January 2017 , she traveled to Syria and met with Assad personally , catching the Democratic leadership in Congress off guard . After returning to the US , she went on CNN and parroted the regime \u2019 s line that there was \u201c no difference \u201d between the mainstream anti-Assad rebels and ISIS . When Assad \u2019 s forces used chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in April 2017 , Gabbard said she was \u201c skeptical \u201d that Assad was responsible , aligning herself with conspiracy theorists against both US intelligence and the overwhelming majority of independent experts .\nNor was Assad was not the only foreign authoritarian Gabbard praised for fighting terrorism . She issued a statement celebrating Egyptian strongman Abdel Fattah el-Sisi \u2019 s \u201c great courage and leadership in taking on ... extreme Islamist ideology \u201d \u2014 despite Sisi taking power in a coup and massacring more than 800 peaceful protesters in a single day .\nShe also proposed a policy of US special forces raids around the world and even expressed a willingness to authorize torture of terrorism suspects if she were president . She referred to herself in one interview as a \u201c dove \u201d on regime change but a \u201c hawk \u201d on terrorism , neatly summarizing her actual positions .\nThese attacks on Obama alienated her from the party \u2019 s leadership and mainstream years before she would announce her presidential bid .\nShe tried courting the emerging left \u2014 going out on a limb to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) in the 2016 primary \u2014 but that , too , failed to win many adherents . In 2017 , the socialist publication Jacobin published a brutal takedown titled \u201c Tulsi Gabbard Is Not Your Friend , \u201d focusing on dispelling the myth of Gabbard as an opponent of America \u2019 s wars abroad .\nIn January 2019 , the Intercept , a left-aligned antiwar outlet , published a deeply reported expos\u00e9 on Gabbard \u2019 s ties to Hindu nationalists . Gabbard has long supported Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , an anti-Islam right-winger who had previously been barred from entering the US due to being personally implicated in deadly anti-Muslim riots . In turn , American Hindu supporters of Modi had become some of Gabbard \u2019 s biggest donors \u2014 including some disturbingly Islamophobic groups .\nThese attacks in the left press underscore how divisive a figure she is even among the party \u2019 s left wing . It \u2019 s hard to see why a faction that was troubled by Hillary Clinton \u2019 s foreign policy record would be open to someone who had engaged in borderline Islamophobic rhetoric about \u201c radical Islam , \u201d called for escalations in the war on terrorism , and backed anti-Islam populists and dictators abroad . Why not vote for Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who have no such problematic records ?\nAnd that \u2019 s more or less what appeared to happen . Gabbard won over a very small minority of Democrats who found her anti-regime change message authentic , and even made some fans among anti-war libertarians .
