Today he looks like the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party . What happened ?\nIn part it was geographic . The former vice president \u2019 s core supporters were scarce in early voting states , but more prevalent from South Carolina on . He also likely benefited from a bandwagon effect , attracting support because suddenly he seemed like a winner .\nBut one foundational aspect of Mr. Biden \u2019 s sudden strength was almost certainly that much of the institutional Democratic Party stood up and rallied around him . After rank-and-file African American voters threw their weight behind him in South Carolina , party actors from elected officials to local activists decided within a few days to coalesce around an imperfect but broadly acceptable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders , whom many feared would drag them to defeat in down-ballot races this fall .\nSen. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr. Biden just prior to Super Tuesday . Former rival Beto O \u2019 Rourke backed him , too . Money and more endorsements began flooding in . Suddenly , the way was clear for voters to unify around a single alternative to Senator Sanders \u2013 and they did .\nSanders supporters have complained that the playing field isn \u2019 t level and that party coordination of any sort is an undemocratic influence . But this isn \u2019 t a new conflict . Tension between pure democracy and the preferences of political elites has long been a part of America \u2019 s complicated presidential nomination system .\nIn 2020 , it took so long it almost seemed it wouldn \u2019 t happen .\n\u201c But given the situation , I think the party has acted like it \u2019 s deciding , \u201d says Hans Noel , an associate professor of government at Georgetown University and co-author of the seminal 2008 book \u201c The Party Decides : Presidential Nominations Before and After Reform . \u201d\nThe results of this week \u2019 s \u201c mini-Tuesday \u201d of six state primaries haven \u2019 t brought an official end to the Democratic nomination contest , of course . Mr. Sanders on Wednesday vowed to stay in the race , citing the popularity of his proposals and his appeal to younger voters . He said he planned to attend a scheduled Sunday Democratic debate in Phoenix .\nBut barring a major unforeseen development , the Vermont senator \u2019 s path to the nomination seems all but gone . Mr. Biden won four states on Tuesday , including Michigan , the day \u2019 s biggest prize . Florida , Ohio , Illinois , and Arizona will hold primaries next week , and the former vice president is heavily favored in all .\nGiven that Democratic primaries award delegates proportionally , Mr. Biden will likely soon have a delegate lead that for all practical purposes is insurmountable , if he doesn \u2019 t already . On Wednesday afternoon , the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight rated Biden \u2019 s chances of winning a delegate majority at 99 % .\nIt \u2019 s already hard to remember that in late February , it seemed entirely possible that Mr. Biden would drop out of the race around Super Tuesday . His turnaround was so quick that he gained about 36 points in national polls in 14 days .\n\u201c The polling swing toward Biden is probably the fastest in the history of the primaries , \u201d tweeted FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver on March 9 .\nThat swing was the result of changes in Democratic primary voters \u2019 decisions . Given a one-on-one choice ( the third remaining candidate , Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , has attracted little support ) as a whole they clearly prefer Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders .\nBut many important Democratic Party figures helped those voters along by winnowing the field and signaling through endorsements and other methods that Mr. Biden was now their own clear choice .\nThat means that in 2020 , for the Democratic field , political experts who hold that the party writ large retains a disproportionate influence on nomination choices might be right .\n\u201c It is certainly evidence in their favor . But I believe there was a lot of contingency . I don \u2019 t think it was inevitable , \u201d says Matt Grossmann , an associate professor of political science at Michigan State University .\nIn the 2008 book \u201c The Party Decides , \u201d Dr. Noel and co-authors argued that elements of organized political parties , from officials to special interest groups , can and do organize to support their chosen nominees in the \u201c invisible primary \u201d period before voting actually starts .\nThe 2016 election produced evidence both for and against their theory . On one hand , Hillary Clinton did indeed attract much institutional party support and money prior to the Iowa caucuses , making her the establishment choice . On the other , the Republican nomination went to a candidate the party hierarchy resisted , but seemed too weak and disorganized to stop : Donald Trump .\nThen the 2020 cycle began with Democrats in the same position of the GOP four years before . Candidates were numerous , party coordination seemed weak , and a consensus establishment pick did not emerge prior to Iowa . Suddenly Sen. Sanders seemed on the verge of taking over a party which , while it has drifted left in recent years , organizationally remains resistant to Sanders-style revolution .\n\u201c One question is why it took the party so long to get their coordination together , and if that delay means they really didn \u2019 t do anything , \u201d says Dr. Noel in an email .\nMaybe it was moderate Democratic voters in general , and African American voters in South Carolina and other Super Tuesday states , who lie behind the Biden resurgence , he says .\nBut Dr. Noel thinks the party did have an effect . South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn \u2019 s endorsement of Biden prior to the South Carolina primary was huge . Representative Clyburn is renowned in his state and the highest ranking African American in Congress . The party quickly coalesced around Biden after South Carolina , sending the same sort of signal that it usually sends prior to Iowa regarding the party \u2019 s choice .\nThis didn \u2019 t happen earlier because a lot of people in the party wanted someone else \u2013 Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey , say , or Sen. Kamala Harris of California . It took time for these Biden alternatives to falter . Then came the flood : everyone from Mr. Buttigieg to Mr. Bloomberg ended their bids quickly , and moved to support the sudden front-runner .\nLook at things from the point of view of the party , not the ambitious candidates , says Dr. Noel .\n\u201c From that point of view , it \u2019 s clear they were not comfortable with Sanders , but they weren \u2019 t sure how best to stop him , and not sure whether Biden could really win . The South Carolina results were enough to convince them , \u201d he says .\nTo many Sanders supporters the sudden turnaround in Biden \u2019 s fortunes seems suspicious . All those people dropping out and endorsing Biden all at once ? The Republicans couldn \u2019 t manage that in 2016 . Somebody on the Democratic side must have made some phone calls .\nPresident Trump , for one , has been eager to stoke this suspicion in an effort to split his opponents .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s rigged against Bernie , \u201d President Trump said in an appearance after Super Tuesday .\nBut on the other side , there are political experts who think the nomination system has too little input from party hierarchies and elected officials , not too much .\n\u201c Yes , I do believe that people who govern with the president of the United States and run on the same ticket have the most serious stakes in the nomination process . They should have a greater role , \u201d says Elaine Kamarck , a senior fellow in the Governance Studies program at the Brookings Institution and author of \u201c Primary Politics , \u201d a history of the U.S. nomination system .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
