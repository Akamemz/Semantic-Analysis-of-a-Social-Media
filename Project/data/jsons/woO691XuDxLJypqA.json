But should the outcome ever have been in doubt?As a former senator from New York she won statewide elections here twice. She picked up endorsements from the governor and New York City's mayor. Her popular husband, a two-term president named Bill Clinton, campaigned relentlessly on her behalf, blanketing black churches and minority neighborhoods that have been loyal to the Clinton family for decades.\n\nHere are five reasons the New York Democratic primary felt competitive:\n\n1) Momentum\n\nMrs. Clinton's rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, came into New York on a hot streak. He had won eight of the last nine contests \u2013 some by huge margins. He captured Washington with 73% of the vote; Idaho, 78%; Alaska, 82%. Mr. Sanders\u2019s successful stretch didn\u2019t do much to cut into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s large lead in delegates, but it raised a question: Why wasn\u2019t Mrs. Clinton dominating a field that had been pretty much cleared for her by the party establishment before the race even began?\n\n2) Money\n\nMr. Sanders came to the race with nothing. He flew to campaign stops on Southwest airlines and drove around in a rental car. Those days are long gone. Of late he\u2019s far outraising an opponent who had the best fundraising network in Democratic politics apart from President Barack Obama. The Sanders fundraising model is built on small donors who have proved they can outpace a Clinton machine heavily dependent on well-heeled contributors.\n\nIt\u2019s not a trivial problem for Mrs. Clinton. She is routinely forced to leave the campaign trail to appear at high-dollar fundraisers, events that take time and preparation and expose her to charges she's beholden to special interests. Privately, some of her donors say they wish she could find a way to replicate the Sanders model and draw in more small contributors.\n\n3) Crowds\n\nA Sanders rally has a shock-and-awe quality. It's not just the numbers, though the numbers are huge. About 28,000 came to see him speak in Brooklyn over the weekend; 27,000 in Manhattan last week.\n\nCampaigning in Albany, N.Y., recently, Mr. Sanders worked the crowd into a thunderous, foot-stomping frenzy with his warnings that the economy is \"rigged\" in favor of the wealthiest Americans and his promise to plow the nation's wealth back to the middle class. Afterward, a stream of young supporters poured out of the arena, talking to each other about issues Mr. Sanders had raised in his speech. Mrs. Clinton draws appreciative crowds of respectable size. But nothing on this scale.\n\n4) Polls\n\nIn worrying ways, Mrs. Clinton is moving in the wrong direction. Mr. Sanders erased her national lead in a recent round of polls while her unfavorability ratings have climbed. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed that 56% of voters in both parties held a negative view of Mrs. Clinton, compared to 32% who viewed her positively. That 24-point gap has nearly doubled in the past month.\n\nBy contrast, 45% saw Mr. Sanders in a positive light, versus 36% who viewed him negatively.\n\nAnd yet, Mrs. Clinton isn't losing. She's winning.\n\nFor practical purposes she may have already won. Which brings us to...\n\n5) Math\n\nThe cold, hard numbers show Mrs. Clinton enjoys a lead that looks nearly insurmountable. Coming into the New York primary, she led by 244 pledged delegates. She built that lead via sweeping victories across the South on March 1, and solidified it with wins in five delegate-rich Midwestern and Southern states March 15.\n\nNothing that's happened since then has fundamentally changed the arc of the race. New York, with 247 delegates at stake, was the state that offered Mr. Sanders the best chance to cut into her lead until California votes June 7. And he lost.\n\nWill New York put an end to the anomaly of a winning candidate who appears to be losing? Don't bet on it.\n\nClinton advisers say it comes down to expectations: People expect Mrs. Clinton not to falter.\n\n\"She's the front-runner of front-runners,\" Jennifer Palmieri, a senior Clinton campaign adviser, said in an interview on the eve of the New York primary. \"That's been the case since she got into it.\n\n\"When you look at all these expectations on [Mrs. Clinton], the coverage and the focus is going to be people talking about what's not going as well.
