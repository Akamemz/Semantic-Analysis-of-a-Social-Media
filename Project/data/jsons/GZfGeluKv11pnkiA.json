He 's surveyed the media landscape and much more . His new book pretty much sums it all up with the title , Mr. Trump 's Wild Ride : The Thrills , Chills , Screams , and Occasional Blackouts of an Extraordinary Presidency .\nA major driver of this ride has been the love-hate relationship between the White House and mainstream media or as President Trump calls the press , `` fake news . ''\nGarrett says it 's not just the president who has a problem with the media .\n`` When the public is asking those of us who are front-line reporters , 'Who can they believe ? ' they are essentially saying , 'We 're not sure we can believe you , ' '' Garrett tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 News . `` That 's our problem of our creation and we 've got to own up to that and we 've got to reverse that trend line . ''\nThat 's one reason the battle between CNN 's Jim Acosta and the Trump administration over press passes and decorum has Garrett 's attention . `` I am what they say in the legal community 'an interested party ' because I work there . I 'm on the same front row that Jim Acosta is , that CNN is . ''\nGarrett says it 's a fight that Trump and CNN President Jeff Zucker want .\n`` The First Amendment is important and due process is important and the court is struggling with things that are not clearly defined in this clash , '' says Garrett . `` But I do think that Jeff Zucker and Donald Trump want to have this fight on behalf of not just these serious underlying legal questions but on their own reputational relationship to one another . ''\nThis week , the White House laid out certain ground rules for reporters during press conferences . While Garrett sees himself as a neutral observer , he does believe the Trump administration has a good point .\n`` The CNN position is also , to a certain degree , absolute that there are no limits on decorum in the White House . Well , I do n't believe that as a reporter , '' he says .\nWhen asked if there are limits , Garrett says bluntly : `` I 've exercised them . ''\nGarrett recalled an encounter during a Rose Garden event . He had the microphone in his hand ready to ask a question , but Trump said no and called on the reporter behind him .\n`` Was I giving up my First Amendment rights ? No . The president said , 'No , not you . ' It 's his press conference . I 'm either asked to ask a question , given that privilege and that responsibility , or I 'm not . But guess who runs that ? He does , '' Garrett says .\nThat example is just one of many that keep Garrett covering this wild ride . As a passenger , whether as correspondent or author , he felt it was also his job to cover the ups and downs responsibly .\n`` I 'd covered three presidents before and it felt to me like the country was getting the impression that because this was so different and comes at us so differently , maybe the typical powers of the presidency do n't still exist , '' Garrett tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 News . `` Well , they do . And maybe things are n't getting done ? They are . ''\nGarrett 's reporting style follows the 'just the facts ' trademark and his book also follows that example : recounting the issues with no dreaded anonymous sources .\n`` Everyone is quoted by name . Everyone is quoted by their title and what they saw and what they saw happening\u2026 no one has complained . No one has said , 'That 's inaccurate , that 's out of context . ' No , because they know I 'm a faithful chronicler of what they said and what they observed and what has happened , '' he explains .\nIn a literary market filled with pro and anti-Trump books , Garrett hopes his strikes the right balance as the voice of reason , though it has its drawbacks .\n`` If you want to ask me my deepest , darkest fear about this book , you 've just described it , '' Garrett says . `` That it will fall into this uncomfortable and unknown commercial space\u2026I know it 's valuable , but that is my greatest fear .
