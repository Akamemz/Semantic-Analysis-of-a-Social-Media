However, when the CARES Act passed in late March, additional federal funding was provided to supplement these state-level benefits with a weekly $600 federal pandemic unemployment compensation. Meaning, individuals who went on unemployment after March 27th would receive $600 each week in addition to normal unemployment benefits.\n\nThe additional benefits were aimed at mitigating the financial hardship of layoffs and worker furloughs related to COVID-19 shutdowns. The program is scheduled to end this month. Some say it should be extended, while others say it should end as planned. What do you think?\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFINING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE:\n\nAs a quick reminder, unemployment insurance helps individuals who have lost their jobs by temporarily replacing part of their wages while they look for work.\n\n\n\nCreated in 1935, it is a form of social insurance in which taxes collected from employers are paid into the system on behalf of working people to provide them with income support if they lose their jobs. The system also helps sustain consumer demand during economic downturns by providing a continuous stream of dollars for families to spend.\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT DURING COVID-19:\n\nAs noted, the additional federal unemployment benefits were aimed to support individuals who have suffered financial hardship from COVID-19 related business closures or shutdowns. However, as the program's scheduled endpoint on July 31st, 2020 rapidly approaches, there are several different proposals for what to do next. We\u2019ve outlined a few of these proposals below.\n\n\n\nExtend the $600 per week through the rest of the year: The House passed the HEROES Act, or the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, which extends the $600 weekly unemployment assistance through January 2021. However, the HEROES Act is unlikely to make it through the Senate.\n\n\n\nExtend the $600 per week based on Unemployment Rate: Senate Minority Leader proposed extending the $600 weekly assistance until the date that is 13 weeks after a state\u2019s unemployment rate falls below 6%. Meaning it would be a phased approach that is fully dependent on state level unemployment rates.\n\n\n\nIncentivize re-entering the workforce: Another proposal is to provide an additional $450 per week above a worker\u2019s wage when they return to work before the $600 unemployment benefits end on July 31st.

Opponents say the benefits are incentivizing Americans to not return to work and the benefits will likely hurt the economy in the long run.\n\nWhat do you think?",
