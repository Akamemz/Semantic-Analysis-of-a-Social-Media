    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) - As the Supreme Court gets ready to issue opinions on some high profile and contentious cases , a new national poll indicates Americans are split on whether the high court is doing a good job .\nAccording to a CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday morning , 48 % of the public say they approve of the job the Supreme Court 's doing , with an equal amount saying they disapprove .\nThere is , however , an ideological divide . Fifty-three percent of liberals and 58 % of moderates , but only 37 % of conservatives , say that they approve of the court .\n`` That 's probably a reaction to last year 's decision on Barack Obama 's health care law , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .\nIn a closely watched ruling , the court upheld the Affordable Care Act , better known as Obamacare , last June .\n`` Before that ruling , most conservatives supported the Supreme Court , compared to only 44 % of liberals . Now , most liberals approve of the court , with most conservatives saying they disapprove , '' adds Holland .\nAll that may change over the next week as the Supreme Court releases opinions on affirmative action , same-sex marriage , and the Voting Rights Act , cases that are sure to generate fresh controversy .\nThe case involving affirmative action is Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin . Abigail Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land , Texas . Fisher claims she was turned away in part because she is white , despite being more qualified than some minority applicants . The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors , such as test scores , community service , leadership and work experience , to ensure a diverse campus .\nAccording to the poll , nearly seven in ten disapprove of affirmative action admissions programs at colleges and law schools that give racial preferences to minority applicants , with 29 % saying they disagree .\nThere 's an obvious partisan divide , with 49 % of Democrats , 24 % of independents , and just 14 % of Republicans approving of such affirmative action programs . And there 's a racial gap , with 51 % of non-white respondents but just 19 % of white respondents saying they approve of giving preferences to minority applicants .\nAlso in front of the Supreme Court is the Voting Rights Act , which was passed in 1965 to prevent some state and local governments from using rules and procedures which prevented many black Americans from voting . The key enforcement provision of the measure was reauthorized in 2006 for another 25 years , with all or parts of 16 states covered under the `` pre-clearance '' provision .\nA county in Alabama subsequently filed suit , saying the federal monitoring of their election procedures was overly burdensome and unwarranted . The case before the high court is called Shelby County , Alabama v. Holder .\nThe survey indicates the public is evenly divided over whether the Voting Rights Act is still necessary , with 48 % saying yes and 50 % saying no . There 's a slight racial gap and a larger partisan divide .\nThere are two same-sex marriage cases in front of the Supreme Court .\nAt issue in Hollingsworth v. Perry is whether the U.S. Constitution 's 14th Amendment guarantee of `` equal protection '' prevents states from defining marriage as being only between one man and one woman . The case involves California 's Proposition 8 , a statewide ballot measure that banned same-sex marriages in the Golden State , which California 's Supreme Court had previously ruled were legal .\nAccording to the poll , 55 % of Americans support same-sex marriage , with 44 % opposed . The 55 % support is up 11 percentage points from 2008 .\n`` In the 1970s , when polls first tackled this touchy topic , a majority of Americans believed that homosexual relationships between consenting adults were morally wrong , a belief that persisted into the 1990s and the first few years of the 21st century , '' says Holland . `` But three years ago , the number who felt that homosexual relationships were morally wrong began to drop below 50 % , and currently 54 % of the public says that homosexual relationships are not a moral issue .

Because her partner was a woman , the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage legally , even though their home state of New York did . The law known as DOMA defines marriage for federal purposes as a union between a man and woman only .\nThe legal issue is whether the federal government can deny tax , health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry .\nAccording to the poll , 60 % say the federal government should recognize same-sex marriages performed in states that allow them , with 39 % saying they disagree .\nThe poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International June 11-13 , with 1,014 adults nationwide questioned by telephone .
