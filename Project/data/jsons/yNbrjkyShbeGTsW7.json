    "content": "What if the push against \u201c normalizing \u201d the potential horrors of a Trump administration ends up making the actual administration seem better by comparison ?\nIn the 10 days since Donald Trump was elected to the presidency , critics \u2014 liberal and conservative alike \u2014 of Donald Trump and his inner circle have warned that his presidency will violate , undermine , and permanently weaken democratic norms . Comparisons have been made to the rise of Putinist autocracy in Russia ( here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and elsewhere ) , to the slow descent of Turkey into authoritarianism under Recep Tayyip Erdogan , to Nazi Germany .\nPeople fret that the Trump administration will crack down on a free press ; that it will only serve to enrich itself ; that it will try to keep itself in power indefinitely . You \u2019 ve probably seen warnings that we shouldn \u2019 t even assume there will be another presidential election in 2020 , because President Trump might have found a way to suspend or amend the Constitution by then .\nGiven everything that \u2019 s happened this year \u2014 including what the past two weeks have revealed about the Trump administration-in-waiting \u2014 it \u2019 s hard to say that planning for the worst-case scenario is irrational . The people most alarmist have , generally , been the most correct . ( One notable exception : There was violence at neither the Republican National Convention nor on Election Day . )\nBut what if the reality of the Trump administration turns out to be not quite the worst-case scenario ? What if it is simply very bad in less unprecedented ways ? Won \u2019 t that seem , by comparison , normal ?\nThis is the real danger of a fight against \u201c normalization \u201d that assumes that the country is being drawn inevitably down the road to authoritarianism : The Trump administration could take another path and go unnoticed .\nDonald Trump probably won \u2019 t cancel elections , but he could \u2014 and is relatively likely to \u2014 oversee a sweeping rollback of voting rights . His administration may not throw journalists in jail , but it could easily step up surveillance of domestic protesters . His appointees may not entrench a permanent oligarchy , but it could still \u2014 for millions of people in America \u2014 reduce the willingness and ability to participate in public life to zero .\nThese wouldn \u2019 t flout the law ; they \u2019 d be under color of it and even in concert with it . But they would , nonetheless , be a tragedy for democracy .\nThe first few days of Trump \u2019 s presidential transition have been so chaotic that even minimal competence would seem like an improvement\nWhen Donald Trump picked Steve Bannon to serve as his chief strategist , outrage against \u201c normalization \u201d of a man who mainstreamed white nationalism drove thousands of activists to mob congressional phone lines and demand their members of Congress speak out against him . In the past week , many Democrats in both chambers have done just that \u2014 with progressive hero Sen. Bernie Sanders giving a big speech to call for Bannon \u2019 s firing .\nBannon is an easy case . Not only are his views ( or at least the views that he spent years mainstreaming as publisher of Breitbart ) deplorable \u2014 to use a word Clinton leveled against Trump \u2019 s supporters \u2014 but he has no experience whatsoever in government . He is not only objectionable but unqualified . His primary qualification is loyalty to President-elect Trump .\nThis is an emerging theme of the Trump administration . The Trump transition team has projected so little interest in the basic work of governing that , if they get to the point of minimal competence by inauguration day , it will seem like a major achievement .\nWe \u2019 ve seen this before ; it \u2019 s how the Trump team operates . Plenty of Republicans blew off the Trump campaign as incompetent during the primaries , then forced themselves to reconsider its wisdom when Trump won the nomination . Plenty of Americans are currently cautioning that even though they voted against Trump for president , they \u2019 re giving him a chance to change their minds \u2014 exactly the mindset that the anti- \u201c normalization \u201d crew is pushing against by pointing out how unusual the transition has been so far .\nEventually , though , the transition will probably get its act together at least a little bit . It will start holding meetings with Obama administration counterparts at the Justice and State Departments . And some of the people it nominates to top positions will be less obviously unqualified to serve than Steve Bannon .\nJust as Bannon isn \u2019 t a normal pick for a position that President-elect Trump says will be an \u201c equal partner \u201d with the chief of staff , President-elect Trump \u2019 s pick for attorney general , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-AL ) , is not a normal pick for attorney general .\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee refused to recommend him for a federal judgeship in 1986 , after confirmation testimony revealed that he \u2019 d called the Ku Klux Klan \u201c okay until I found out they smoked pot \u201d ( he claims he was joking ) ; responded to a story about a white judge calling a white lawyer a \u201c race traitor \u201d for representing a black client with , \u201c well , maybe he is \u201d ; and called one black co-worker \u201c boy \u201d while telling another to \u201c watch what you say around white folks . \u201d\nAt the time , the Judiciary Committee had only rejected one other potential judge in nearly half a century . Sessions was the second . And the committee was run by Republicans at the time .\nBut Sessions is now a US senator , and is likely to be given the courtesy in his upcoming attorney general confirmation hearings that senators usually give each other . Republican Sen. Jeff Flake ( R-AZ ) , regarded as of the few Republicans in the Senate willing to stand up to Trump , has already promised to vote for Sessions .\nSenate Democrats aren \u2019 t mobilizing against Sessions in the way they mobilized against Bannon . Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) , the leading Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , allowed in a statement that she and Sessions \u201c differ on a great many issues , \u201d she emphasized that hearings would be a \u201c thorough vetting \u201d of Sessions \u2019 s views \u2014 hardly a promise to oppose his confirmation .\nSimilarly , Rudy Giuliani , who \u2019 s rumored to be the leading candidate for secretary of state , is not a normal pick for secretary of state . He has no diplomatic experience whatsoever . But because he has at least been in politics and public life for a long time , he \u2019 s viewed as a relatively serious pick .\nFor all the legit criticism of Giuliani , consider this - two-term major city mayor + former federal prosecutor . Not a lightweight . \u2014 Maggie Haberman ( @ maggieNYT ) November 18 , 2016\nIt \u2019 s true as far as it goes : Giuliani is not merely a Trump toady who serves no purpose other than to help Trump grow his business empire . By the same token , Sessions has a record of interest in issues the Department of Justice covers ; he isn \u2019 t just going to use prosecutions to reward Trump \u2019 s friends and punish his enemies .\nThat doesn \u2019 t make either of them normal \u2014 or responsible \u2014 picks . But when people are putting so much effort into staying alert to signs that Trump will lead America swiftly down the road to Putinism , everything short of that seems relatively reassuring .\nThe Trump administration can damage America and democracy \u2014 without doing the worst things it \u2019 s been accused of\nOn Wednesday night , Carl Higbie , who ran a pro-Trump Super PAC during the campaign , replied to rumors that Trump would start a \u201c Muslim registry \u201d by defending Japanese internment during World War II .\nThe incident was widely reported as a \u201c Trump surrogate \u201d defending Japanese internment \u2014 implying Higbie is involved with the administration-in-waiting . And many of the responses , to both the Higbie incident and the rumors of the Muslim registry itself , have gone much further in assuming Trump will label , track , and detain Muslim American citizens than the Trump transition itself has said .\nThe plan that the Trump transition is rumored to be considering is still very bad . But it \u2019 s not going to be as obvious in its implementation as a call for all American Muslims to turn themselves in to the authorities . It \u2019 s not going to be something that non-Muslim Americans can easily jam by registering en masse ; it might not be something non-Muslim Americans know much about at all .\nMany people warning against the \u201c normalization \u201d of Donald Trump are assuming that the institutions he \u2019 ll unravel will be the ones they \u2019 re paying attention to : the free press , NATO , the norm against using presidential power for personal enrichment . They assume that everyone will be affected equally by Trump \u2019 s seizing of power .\nBut what if a Trump administration is basically okay \u2014 or at least not disastrous \u2014 for at least some people ? For white people ?\nThe real danger is we \u2019 ll only see the harm done to people who have the biggest platforms\nOne of the things we \u2019 ve seen this year is that the democratic norms that the political class and media are most sensitive to , and the bigotries they \u2019 re most likely to condemn , are the ones that affect them and people they know directly .\nAs the New Republic \u2019 s Brian Beutler has pointed out , the most eloquent defense of democratic norms by the press in the days after Trump \u2019 s election happened when Trump slipped out for a steak dinner unnoticed by his \u201c protective \u201d press pool . In other words , journalists defended the norm when the norm helped journalists .\nJournalists have long been sensitive to the prevalence of misogyny on social media . In 2016 , they \u2019 ve become alarmed by anti-Semitism on social media as well . Journalists know and work among women ; they know and work among Jews .\nMany of them don \u2019 t know and work among many people of color . The amount of attention paid to racism on social media ( or in real life ) among journalists is , accordingly , often disproportionately small \u2014 or delayed .\nIn 2016 , with Trump running for president , this has reflected itself in who elicits sympathy when they \u2019 re trolled on the internet , or harassed in person . In 2017 , it threatens to make journalists blind to genuine threats to democracy that take the form of unsewing certain marginalized groups from public life .\nWhen the Justice Department refuses to take states to court for passing laws that restrict the ability of black or Latino citizens to vote , it makes it harder for citizens to participate in democracy . When someone on a student visa from a majority-Muslim country knows that he is under \u201c special registration , \u201d it \u2019 s liable to chill his speech . Both of these prevent democracy from being \u201c of the people . \u201d\nWhen immigrants don \u2019 t report crimes to police because they worry the government will deport them \u2014 when immigrant parents are afraid to come to schools for parent-teacher conferences , or even to bring their children to school at all , because they see public schools as part of the government too \u2014 that too undermines democracy . It prevents democracy from being \u201c for the people . \u201d\nThe Trump administration could still be a government of the people . It could still resemble a democracy . But it could quietly push America in the direction of government by , and for , only certain groups of people .\nThis shouldn \u2019 t seem normal , either . Normalization doesn \u2019 t just happen actively ; it happens when everyone \u2019 s attention is turned to the same , single worst-case thing .",
