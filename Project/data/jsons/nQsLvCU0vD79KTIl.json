    "content": "On Wednesday , Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump delivered a planned speech on his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton , and according to Slate columnist and Clinton supporter Michelle Goldberg , it was \u201c probably the most unnervingly effective one he has ever given , \u201d in which he skillfully combined \u201c truth and falsehood into a plausible-seeming picture meant to reinforce listeners \u2019 underlying beliefs . \u201d\nThough packed with fabrications as usual , the Republican presidential nominee avoided blatant and obvious lies , bizarre conspiracy theories ( although he did claim that foreign governments may have a \u201c blackmail file \u201d on Clinton while discussing the email scandal , which is entering Alex Jones territory ) , and personal insults -- all of which he had previously employed in his attacks on Clinton . Again , the speech was extremely dishonest in many parts , but the falsehoods were more subtle and less downright loony , and thus much more effective .\nOver the past couple of weeks , Trump has done a lot to sabotage his own campaign \u2014 from his racist attacks on the Hispanic judge overseeing the class-action lawsuit against Trump University to his shameless Tweet congratulating himself after the Orlando mass shooting . This has led some to conclude that the billionaire doesn \u2019 t really want to be president ( and really , who can blame him ? ) and is deliberately running his campaign into a wall . Since becoming the nominee almost two months ago , his already atrocious favorability ratings have continued to drop , and according to a Bloomberg survey from last week , 66 percent of Americans now view him unfavorably .\nThere is no doubt that the election is Clinton \u2019 s to lose . The former Secretary of State \u2019 s campaign is a well-oiled machine that currently has about forty times as much cash on hand as the Trump campaign . And while Clinton is overwhelmingly distrusted ( and disliked ) by the public , the idea of a Donald Trump presidency tends to scare more than half of Americans , and he has done a great job at repelling women and people of color over the past year .\nHowever , if Trump can refrain from attacking Bill Clinton \u2019 s infidelities and accusing the couple of plotting the murder of a friend and colleague ( Vince Foster ) , and instead make substantive criticisms ( and there are plenty of substantive criticisms to be made ) , he could potentially make Clinton \u2019 s life much more difficult in the months ahead .\nOf course , it is unlikely that Trump will actually do this \u2014 he has proven time and again that he has a natural aversion towards substantive debate , and prefers touting conspiracy theories and making personal attacks . He is an impulsive bully whose propensity for pettiness knows no bounds . But the sheer political baggage of Clinton does make her very vulnerable indeed .\nFrom her ties to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs ( whether in campaign contributions or paid speeches ) to the Clinton Foundation \u2019 s financial connections to foreign governments like Saudi Arabia , along with ugly and inconvenient truths \u2014 like the fact that Clinton \u2019 s state department approved massive arms deals with the aforementioned country after it had donated millions to her and Bill \u2019 s non-profit , or the fact that Bill earned the highest paid speeches of his post-presidency career while his wife was Secretary of State , most of which were sponsored by foreign governments and foreign organizations .\nIf Trump sticks to these kinds of facts in his criticisms of Clinton \u2014 without straying into Alex Jones ( or Donald Trump the mindless bully ) territory \u2014 Hillary \u2019 s path to the White House could become increasingly complicated . It does make you wonder : after being dogged by scandals and conspiracy theories ever since they entered the national spotlight , did Hillary and Bill think that giving high-priced speeches for publicly despised companies like Goldman Sachs and General Electric , accepting millions of dollars from foreign governments and organizations for their foundation , or cozying up with shady donors like Sant Chatwal and Frank Giustra ( all of these companies , individuals , and governments are interested in buying influence , and to say otherwise is delusional ) would be ignored by their opponents ? As I have previously noted , it takes a special kind of arrogance to think this way , although it \u2019 s possible that Hillary expected her Republican opponent to be even more tainted by big donors ( being a Republican and all ) .\nOf course , Donald Trump is an entirely different kind of corrupt . He hasn \u2019 t been in politics his entire life and doesn \u2019 t have a history of accepting big donations from Wall Street and corporate America . Instead , the billionaire is simply a charlatan and a fraud \u2014 whether it \u2019 s swindling vulnerable working people into buying sham Trump University degrees or fear-mongering , bullying and flagrantly lying his way to the nomination . Trump is the lovechild of P.T . Barnum and George Wallace ; a shameless self-promoter with an ego that makes Kanye West look humble and a temperament that makes Joe McCarthy seem refined .\nAnd these qualities will probably get the better of him in the months ahead . The buffoonish billionaire will most likely continue rambling incoherently about conspiracy theories that he \u2019 s read on Infowars.com and mocking Bubba \u2019 s infidelities , and for this , Clinton should be grateful .",
