''\nThat means up to 100 senators \u2014 along with their staffs , support workers , visitors and others \u2014 will return to the Capitol building , with some new health guidelines .\nWashington , D.C. , Mayor Muriel Bowser noted recently that members of Congress are considered essential workers . As a result , Congress does n't have to adhere to her stay-at-home order and closure of nonessential businesses .\nThe Senate 's return will also start a new wave of worries about more coronavirus infections on Capitol Hill , where dozens of workers , staffers and members of Congress have already been sickened or quarantined .\nMcConnell , R-Ky. , has led efforts to resume Senate business over the objections of some members . The chamber is slated to consider several presidential nominations this week , including a confirmation vote for an agency official Monday .\nDemocrats have said the move could put those in the Capitol complex and beyond in danger . They have also said the Senate should narrow its legislative focus to coronavirus aid or its oversight . The Democratic-led House is not returning this week .\nAfter approving about $ 3 trillion in aid so far , Republicans and Democrats are split on a new infusion of cash into the badly strained economy . Democrats say state and local governments should be the priority , while Republicans are holding out for new liability protections for businesses .\n`` Senate Republicans should be laser focused on the health and economic crises caused by COVID-19 , not confirming right-wing judges or protecting big business from legal liability , '' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , wrote on Twitter .\nOn Friday , McConnell shared new Senate guidelines from Brian Monahan , the attending physician to Congress , to avoid gatherings and wear masks when possible . The guidelines also advise members and others to maintain 6 feet of distance , limit staff and visitors in offices , and participate in health monitoring programs .\n`` I strongly urge my colleagues to consult these guidelines as we carefully resume in-person work , '' McConnell said .\nBut like much of the rest of the country , there is no widespread testing program on Capitol Hill . Meanwhile , none of the new Senate safety measures are mandatory .\n`` I think this is crazy . I really do , '' Dr. David Relman , a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University , said after reviewing Monahan 's guidance . `` We do n't want them to have to undertake the kinds of risks that put not only themselves in grave jeopardy , but others . And furthermore , we want them to be role models and they are not behaving as role models when they undertake this kind of convening in large numbers . ''\nLate Friday , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the agency would send 1,000 coronavirus tests to Congress . President Trump lauded the move .\nBut on Saturday , McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , issued a rare joint statement , declining the offer and saying the tests should be directed to front-line workers since national testing access remains limited .\nStill , Relman says , the current parameters for the Senate 's return signal a misunderstanding of the measures required for essential workers to protect themselves and others . And that includes a clear plan for testing .\n`` I 'm just having a hard time here , understanding what the rationale is and how this can be good for our nation , '' said Relman , who is also chief of infectious diseases at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System in California . `` These essential workers are not embracing the known measures that will reduce risks down to some reasonable level for them . It 's sort of capricious and dangerous . ''\nAlso , with the average age of the Senate above 60 , the dangers are even higher , Relman said . Members will carry different levels of risk of exposure depending on which region they 'll travel to and from .\nHe pointed to the Canadian and British parliaments as better models , where government leaders have installed remote meeting options . Such a move has been blocked in the Senate by McConnell and remains under debate in the House .\nWithout remote plans , members and others meeting in person in Congress should be tested twice a week and adhere to weekly antibody tests , Relman said . Social distancing requirements should also be mandatory , he added .\nMeanwhile , it could be weeks before senators find out the impacts of meeting in person , since the illness can have a lengthy incubation period .\n`` It 's a huge ripple effect that has ramifications for lots of people , including many other members of the very same body of political leaders that they have suggested are essential , '' Relman said .\nThe Senate will take up the nomination of Robert Feitel to be the next inspector general for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday . On Tuesday , the Senate Intelligence Committee will hear from Trump 's nominee for director of national intelligence , Republican Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe .\nIt 's a reminder that the Senate 's focus remains on regular business since new coronavirus aid talks are stalled .\nOne key hangup : McConnell and other Republicans are pushing for new liability protections for businesses in a next wave of funding .
