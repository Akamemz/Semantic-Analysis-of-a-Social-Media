    "content": "The climate crisis of the 21st century has been caused largely by just 90 companies , which between them produced nearly two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions generated since the dawning of the industrial age , new research suggests . The companies range from investor-owned firms \u2014 household names such as Chevron , Exxon , and BP \u2014 to state-owned and government-run firms . The analysis , which was welcomed by the former Vice President Al Gore as a \u201c crucial step forward , \u201d found that the vast majority of the firms were in the business of producing oil , gas , or coal . The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Climatic Change . \u201c There are thousands of oil , gas , and coal producers in the world , \u201d said climate researcher and author Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute in Colorado . \u201c But the decisionmakers , the CEOs , or the ministers of coal and oil if you narrow it down to just one person , they could all fit on a Greyhound bus or two . \u201d\nHalf of the estimated emissions were produced just in the past 25 years \u2014 well past the date when governments and corporations became aware that rising greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of coal and oil were causing dangerous climate change .\nMany of the same companies are also sitting on substantial fossil fuel reserves which \u2014 if they are burned \u2014 puts the world at even greater risk of dangerous climate change .\nClimate change experts said the data set was the most ambitious effort so far to hold individual carbon producers , rather than governments , to account .\nThe United Nations climate change panel , the IPCC , warned in September that at current rates the world stood within 30 years of exhausting its \u201c carbon budget \u201d \u2014 the amount of carbon dioxide it could emit without going into the danger zone above 2 degrees C warming .
