( Cathal McNaughton/Reuters )\nThe roots of the present-day anti-Semitic motif go through the Middle Ages and all the way back to antiquity .\nAnti-Semitism has many exceptional qualities . Unlike most forms of racism , it is a conspiracy theory . Like all conspiracy theories , it is a search for the Devil , or for the Devil \u2019 s agents on earth . They are imagined not as an underclass to be exploited and despised but as a preternaturally powerful elite that enslaves and destroys humankind . The anti-Semite \u201c punches up \u201d at the Jews who close the road to deliverance from oppression .\nDespite its lethality , anti-Semitism is the form of racism most often erased , excused , and even encouraged by people who identify as \u201c antiracist. \u201d One explanation for this phenomenon , increasingly dangerous as harassment , vandalism , and violence against Jews rise across the West , is the failure of Holocaust education to emphasize the importance of conspiracism in Nazi ideology . For their part , soi-disant American antiracists render Jews \u201c white \u201d and \u201c privileged \u201d through a limited lens of race and power , taking an approach that is an allotrope of anti-Semitism and disqualifies Jews from concern .\nSo when U.S. representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar resolved to visit Israel in August to showcase to the world its peculiar evil , and it emerged that Miftah , the Palestinian non-governmental organization co-sponsoring their trip , had published on its website that Jews bake Christian blood into their matzoh , most major media ignored it . For them the story was the erosion of liberal democracy by the tag team of Trump and Netanyahu , who had barred entry to the congresswomen . There is little indication that the blood libel stirred concern on the left where just a month earlier \u201c Never again \u201d was intoned relentlessly about Trump \u2019 s \u201c concentration camps \u201d at the border .\nThe omission is striking . Blood libel is the purest expression of Jew-hatred there is . To overlook it is not just to miss a spectacular instance of bigotry ; it is to be oblivious to anti-Semitism . The reason the blood libel has pride of place in the persecution of Jews is that it exemplifies anti-Semitism \u2019 s worst exceptional quality . Most types of racism define their victims as an \u201c other \u201d in relation to the group and regard them as less than human . Anti-Semitism , like all conspiracy theories , marks its target as an \u201c other \u201d in relation to humanity and regards the target as anti-human .\nThis dynamic has been present since the beginning of Western civilization . In his book Europe \u2019 s Inner Demons , the historian Norman Cohn demonstrates that by the second century a popular \u201c fantasy \u201d had emerged that civilization was threatened by a secret society \u201c addicted to practices which were felt to be wholly abominable. \u201d Of course , xenophobia has always assumed the existence of in-groups and out-groups . Generally , out-groups are opposed to in-groups through stereotypes that suggest the inferiority of the former . Ancient Greeks , for example , regarded various foreign peoples as childlike babblers . Romans thought their Jewish subjects smelled bad \u2014 a prejudice that survived in Europe long after the Empire fell .\nConspiracist xenophobia uses stereotypes that suggest much more \u2014 a set of behaviors , terrible and extranormal , of which only anti-human conspirators could be capable . These include cannibalism , atrocious sexual practices such as incest and pedophilia , and the sexualized worship of monstrous gods . Rituals are performed in clandestine ceremonies . At the center there is often a child , typically a young boy , murdered and consumed for purposes of black magic .\nRitual murder was a \u201c stock charge \u201d in the ancient world . Dio Cassius accused three separate cabals \u2014 the Cataline conspirators and Egyptians and Alexandrian Jews in revolt against Rome \u2014 of sacrificing a boy and eating his entrails to inaugurate their plots for power . The Greek grammarian Apion applied the canard against all Jews , although in that era it was Christians who suffered the most as a result of stereotypes that reduced some people to the status of the anti-human . In 177 the Romans martyred believers near present-day Lyons , torturing their pagan slaves into corroborating familiar rumors \u2014 that their Christian masters were an incest cult who sacrificed and devoured children .\nAfter Christianity was established as the state religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century , those lurid fantasies simmered underground for the better part of a millennium . Meanwhile , Christians refined their theology of combat between the forces of good and the forces of evil : between God and Satan , between Christ and Antichrist , and between the righteous people and the demonic people who served as their agents on earth . In that morally supercharged xenophobia , Satan was attached to groups set apart as the \u201c other. \u201d The scope of the anti-human conspiracy became cosmic .\nWhile Christian heretics and women thought to be witches would suffer unimaginably from this association , the Jews were destined to reap the worst of it in the form of the Holocaust . ( The word alludes , with the grimmest irony , to a \u201c burnt offering. \u201d ) Various passages of the New Testament were read as confirmation of the idea of Jewish guilt for killing Christ and of Jewish communion with the Devil .\nIn the medieval mind , the association between Jews and the Devil grew . Shortly before Easter in 1144 , a young boy named William was found dead in the sallow grass of a heath near the lively center of Norwich , England . His body , stripped naked save for a jacket and shoes , showed signs of violence . He had been gagged with a piece of wood . Despairing relatives accused local Jews of the crime , but the charge didn \u2019 t take . Five years later , a Benedictine monk hoping to establish a local cult spun the rumors into a tale of ritual murder .\nThe myth of little William spread , partly because it met a subterranean need we all share : to explain and dramatize terrible events that happen for mysterious or mundane reasons . Over the next hundred years , copycat claims arose throughout Europe . Yet the mature blood accusation \u2014 that Jews ritually murder Christians to harvest their blood for Passover \u2014 wouldn \u2019 t become standard until the 14th century . The thinking about Jews and blood needed to develop before it might make emotional sense .\nChristians in the Middle Ages regarded Jews as sorcerers , allied with demons . Little distinction was made between magic and medicine . When the charges of ritual murder were spreading , Jews were widely thought to suffer from peculiar maladies , many of which caused blood loss : hemorrhages , hemorrhoids , quinsy , scrofula , skin diseases , purulent sores ; Jewish men were said to menstruate along with women , and Jewish babies to be born with one hand fixed to their foreheads , requiring surgery to detach . The recipes of medieval magic often focused on sickness and health , and sometimes they called for blood or body parts . Jews were assumed to need non-Jewish blood to be well . Christian life and Jewish life were literally held to be inversely related .\nThe effect of such fantasies was demonstrated in 1475 when a little boy named Simon went missing in Trent . Local Jews were seized and tortured into confessing that they ritually slaughtered him and drained his blood . Many were burned alive . Blood had become the preferred motif for expressing what medieval Christians conceived of as a parasitical Jewish project to destroy their civilization . While the Nazi movement thought itself superior to Christianity , it imported wholesale the idea of the Jews as the Devil \u2019 s agents , coupled to the anti-human stereotype that was embodied by the medieval blood libel . Rumors of blood libel and incidents related to it recurred in Europe until even after the Nazi surrender .\nIn the blood-libel piece posted on the Miftah site in 2013 , President Obama was said to have held an imprudent Passover seder at the White House , where he enjoyed \u201c Jewish cuisine \u201d that was likely prepared with the blood of Christians . Under intense criticism , Miftah eventually retracted and apologized , but the medieval pitch of the piece was so true that I browsed their website for similar material and quickly found an article by Bouthaina Shaaban , who is now Bashar Assad \u2019 s media adviser . There Shaaban writes that Israel stole \u201c Ukrainian children in order to harvest their organs. \u201d The blood libel was transferred to the Arab world by Christian missionaries , surfacing in a famous case at Damascus in 1840 .
