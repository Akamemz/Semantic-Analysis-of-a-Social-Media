That \u2019 s 60 % compared to 11 % in 1997 . And it \u2019 s estimated that kids age s 8 to 18 spend about 45 hours a week in front of screens .\nWith internet use built into virtually every stage of childhood , parents face the responsibility of teaching their kids about internet safety at an earlier and earlier age .\nThere are a vast number of subjects parents have to help their children navigate as they get older . Among these is proactively educating children about internet safety and how to protect oneself online every day .\nFor a generation reared online , so to speak , it \u2019 s nearly impossible to pinpoint an age when children are not engaging with the internet . Since the internet is everywhere , and since the way we use it is constantly changing shape , platforms , and algorithms , it \u2019 s important to recognize that personal cybersecurity isn \u2019 t a topic to cover some day \u201c when they \u2019 re ready . \u201d\nMembers of Generation Z are digital natives because they \u2019 ve used the internet and mobile devices practically from infancy .

If this password gets compromised by a data breach , any other accounts linked to that same password are now at risk since hackers have the credentials . By the time we realize our data is leaked , it \u2019 s usually already too late to prevent the impending damage\u2014such as stolen identities or hacked email accounts . With all the data breaches making headlines these days , you need to do everything you can to keep your children \u2019 s accounts secure . Ensure they use a strong , unique password for each account to help protect data from hackers .\nWe hear it all the time , but that \u2019 s because it \u2019 s the best advice : passwords should be complex , contain 12 or more characters , and use a combination of letters and numbers . Additionally , it \u2019 s never a good idea to use names , birthdates , or other personal information in a password .\nOf course , it can be challenging to remember individual passwords across numerous online accounts . So , you might opt to use a password management tool\u2014such as Dashlane or the ironically-named 1Password , both of which encrypt and store multiple passwords to help keep track of your credentials . These tools are fairly kid-friendly too , to make it easier to get your kids in the habit of using them early on .\nThe unfortunate reality is that every piece of information you share online has the potential to be sold , misused , and/or leaked . The number of security breaches continue to rise . There were 3,800 data breaches counted in just the first half of 2019 .

Think about the Cambridge Analytica scandal , when the data of millions of Facebook users was shared without their consent .
