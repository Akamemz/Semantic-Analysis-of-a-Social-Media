    "content": "The white working class , which usually inspires liberal concern only for its paradoxical , Republican-leaning voting habits , has recently become newsworthy for something else : according to economist Anne Case and Angus Deaton , the winner of the latest Nobel Prize in economics , its members in the 45- to 54-year-old age group are dying at an immoderate rate . While the lifespan of affluent whites continues to lengthen , the lifespan of poor whites has been shrinking . As a result , in just the last four years , the gap between poor white men and wealthier ones has widened by up to four years . The New York Times summed up the Deaton and Case study with this headline : \u201c Income Gap , Meet the Longevity Gap . \u201d\nThis was not supposed to happen . For almost a century , the comforting American narrative was that better nutrition and medical care would guarantee longer lives for all . So the great blue-collar die-off has come out of the blue and is , as the Wall Street Journal says , \u201c startling . \u201d\nIt was especially not supposed to happen to whites who , in relation to people of color , have long had the advantage of higher earnings , better access to health care , safer neighborhoods , and of course freedom from the daily insults and harms inflicted on the darker-skinned . There has also been a major racial gap in longevity -- 5.3 years between white and black men and 3.8 years between white and black women -- though , hardly noticed , it has been narrowing for the last two decades . Only whites , however , are now dying off in unexpectedly large numbers in middle age , their excess deaths accounted for by suicide , alcoholism , and drug ( usually opiate ) addiction .\nThere are some practical reasons why whites are likely to be more efficient than blacks at killing themselves . For one thing , they are more likely to be gun-owners , and white men favor gunshots as a means of suicide . For another , doctors , undoubtedly acting in part on stereotypes of non-whites as drug addicts , are more likely to prescribe powerful opiate painkillers to whites than to people of color . ( I \u2019 ve been offered enough oxycodone prescriptions over the years to stock a small illegal business . )\nManual labor -- from waitressing to construction work -- tends to wear the body down quickly , from knees to back and rotator cuffs , and when Tylenol fails , the doctor may opt for an opiate just to get you through the day .\nBut something more profound is going on here , too . As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman puts it , the \u201c diseases \u201d leading to excess white working class deaths are those of \u201c despair , \u201d and some of the obvious causes are economic . In the last few decades , things have not been going well for working class people of any color .\nI grew up in an America where a man with a strong back -- and better yet , a strong union -- could reasonably expect to support a family on his own without a college degree . In 2015 , those jobs are long gone , leaving only the kind of work once relegated to women and people of color available in areas like retail , landscaping , and delivery-truck driving . This means that those in the bottom 20 % of white income distribution face material circumstances like those long familiar to poor blacks , including erratic employment and crowded , hazardous living spaces .\nWhite privilege was never , however , simply a matter of economic advantage . As the great African-American scholar W.E.B . Du Bois wrote in 1935 , \u201c It must be remembered that the white group of laborers , while they received a low wage , were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage . \u201d\nSome of the elements of this invisible wage sound almost quaint today , like Du Bois \u2019 s assertion that white working class people were \u201c admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions , public parks , and the best schools. \u201d Today , there are few public spaces that are not open , at least legally speaking , to blacks , while the \u201c best \u201d schools are reserved for the affluent -- mostly white and Asian American along with a sprinkling of other people of color to provide the fairy dust of \u201c diversity. \u201d While whites have lost ground economically , blacks have made gains , at least in the de jure sense . As a result , the \u201c psychological wage \u201d awarded to white people has been shrinking .\nFor most of American history , government could be counted on to maintain white power and privilege by enforcing slavery and later segregation . When the federal government finally weighed in on the side of desegregation , working class whites were left to defend their own diminishing privilege by moving rightward toward the likes of Alabama Governor ( and later presidential candidate ) George Wallace and his many white pseudo-populist successors down to Donald Trump .\nAt the same time , the day-to-day task of upholding white power devolved from the federal government to the state and then local level , specifically to local police forces , which , as we know , have taken it up with such enthusiasm as to become both a national and international scandal . The Guardian , for instance , now keeps a running tally of the number of Americans ( mostly black ) killed by cops ( as of this moment , 1,209 for 2015 ) , while black protest , in the form of the Black Lives Matter movement and a wave of on-campus demonstrations , has largely recaptured the moral high ground formerly occupied by the civil rights movement .\nThe culture , too , has been inching bit by bit toward racial equality , if not , in some limited areas , black ascendency . If the stock image of the early twentieth century \u201c Negro \u201d was the minstrel , the role of rural simpleton in popular culture has been taken over in this century by the characters in Duck Dynasty and Here Comes Honey Boo Boo ; at least in the entertainment world , working class whites are now regularly portrayed as moronic . It \u2019 s not easy to maintain the usual sense of white superiority when parts of the media are squeezing laughs from the contrast between savvy blacks and rural white bumpkins , as in the Tina Fey comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . White , presumably upper-middle class people generally conceive of these characters and plot lines , which , to a child of white working class parents like myself , sting with condescension .\nOf course , there was also the election of the first black president .
