Five years later , that war is largely over . And Washington won in a blowout .\nYou might not know it given continued demands from Democrats \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 to further bust up the nation \u2019 s largest banks . And the standard media refrain is that Wall Street titans always win , no big bank bosses went to jail and the industry will just find new ways to keep the casino open .\nBut the truth on the ground \u2014 at least at this moment in time \u2014 is very different .\nGoldman Sachs , the biggest money machine in Wall Street history , is a shell of its former self . Morgan Stanley , Goldman \u2019 s one-time bitter rival in the swashbuckling world of high-risk trading , is transforming into a staid money management firm with a side business underwriting stocks and offering merger advice .\nCitigroup and Bank of America sold off many of their classic \u201c Wall Street \u201d businesses , including proprietary trading desks and private equity and hedge fund stakes , to comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill .\nWashington \u2019 s big victory came via widespread public outrage at the financial industry , which paved the way for a strong reform bill . And after President Barack Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010 , the industry made mistake after mistake \u2014 from the interest rate rigging scandal to mortgage-foreclosure \u201c robo-signing \u201d \u2014 making it essentially impossible for the industry \u2019 s lobbyists to beat back any of the newly imposed regulations .\n\u201c The scope of activities that U.S. banks engage in has been dramatically reduced , \u201d said Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief executive of giant bond fund manager Pimco , which itself may face new restrictions as regulators turn their attention to the asset management industry . \u201c Even in a period when markets are performing well , the numbers the banks are pulling in are just nowhere near as strong as they once were . \u201d\nEven mighty JPMorgan Chase , once viewed as the only bank to come through the crisis largely unchanged , is now forking over tens of billions of dollars in settlement cash , seemingly on a weekly basis , to pay for its sins before the financial crisis \u2014 including allegedly turning a blind eye to the Bernie Madoff fraud and improperly selling risky mortgage securities . JPMorgan this week gave up its coveted title as the nation \u2019 s most profitable bank to Wells Fargo , a buttoned down San Francisco-based bank not known as a Wall Street titan .\nAnd JPMorgan \u2019 s massive $ 6 billion loss in the so-called London whale trading scandal in 2012 helped ensure that a very tough version of the ban on proprietary trading by federally backstopped banks \u2014 known as the \u201c Volcker rule \u201d \u2014 was approved by regulators last month .\nThe transformation of Wall Street is so complete that even some of the industry \u2019 s loudest critics \u2014 rarely willing to give an inch \u2014 are prepared to declare at least partial victory , albeit with plenty of \u201c time will tell \u201d caveats and complaints about the industry pushing to underfund its regulators in the latest spending bill working its way through Congress .\n\u201c There is no question that many of the highest-risk activities , which happened to be the most profitable activities for Wall Street , are now at least reduced and often totally gone , \u201d said Dennis Kelleher , chief executive of Better Markets , one of the most vocal pro-regulatory reform groups . \u201c They \u2019 ve had to exit hedge funds and private equity funds and they sold off any business with \u2018 proprietary trading \u2019 on the door . \u201d\nThose sales in part benefit smaller boutique investment banks not subject to the new rules as well as pure hedge fund and private equity firms that can snap up assets from the bigger players at low prices . It also means young talent now flows toward higher-paying private equity and hedge funds rather than the now more staid banks . Both Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse in recent months pitched themselves by saying junior staff should no longer come to the office on Saturdays , a hallmark of the old Wall Street .\nIn fact , perhaps the clearest example of the transformation is Goldman , which on Thursday reported a 15 percent fourth-quarter drop in net revenue in its once dominant fixed income , currency and commodities business to $ 1.72 billion . For the year , Goldman earned a total of profit of $ 8.04 billion .\nIn 2007 , at the height of the last Wall Street boom , Goldman \u2019 s trading wizards earned $ 4.89 billion in net revenue in the same business in the third quarter . And for the year in 2007 , Goldman reported earnings of nearly $ 12 billion .\nTo be sure , some of the drop in trading and other revenue at big Wall Street banks reflects a slower economy and less risk-taking by corporate clients . But it also reflects the fact that under Dodd-Frank , the Volcker rule and new capital requirements instituted by the Federal Reserve and other regulators , Wall Street banks can not trade for their own accounts the way they once did , must maintain much less risky balance sheets and for the most part can no longer sell exotic and high-return products such as collateralized debt or loan obligations .\nThe result of all this is that Wall Street is struggling to make money .\n\u201c There are only two banks beating their cost of capital right now , JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , and neither are beating it by much , \u201d said Brad Hintz , a banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein and a former top executive at Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers . He was referring to how much it costs a bank to make money for shareholders . \u201c New regulations are pushing down the performance of the banks .
