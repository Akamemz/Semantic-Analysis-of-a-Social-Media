We can parse the numbers and shift the start dates , but no amount of fiddling will change this : the nation is angry and divided , and our people are pessimistic . President Obama has depressed our nation , in part because we had hope . We hoped that an inexperienced young African American man could heal the country and bring us together . He promised to do so , and we believed him \u2013 even many of us who hadn \u2019 t voted for him . Honestly , what were we thinking ?\nWe were thinking that this is the greatest nation on earth , and our problems are solvable . We were thinking that Barack Obama was the man to solve them . He would partner with Republicans , as had his predecessor Bill Clinton , and together our political leaders would leap into action . That \u2019 s what we expected , because that is what he promised . We did not take into consideration that this president had no real life experience of the sort that might matter- no management background , no business expertise . Really , these things are important when you are expected to lead a country though a financial crisis .\nToday , there are innumerable signs of the country \u2019 s disappointment . For instance , we are having fewer babies \u2013 surely one of the most personal votes for the future . Our birthrate is estimated to hit a 25-year low this year , as the economic slide engendered the most profound kind of pessimism .\nHow about the mood among small business owners , which after rallying in the early years of Mr. Obama \u2019 s presidency , has been sliding for months and is well below the historical average ? According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses , \u201c during the economic recovery , now three-years-old , the Index has averaged 90 , making this the worst recovery period from a recession in the NFIB survey history ( which began in 1973 ) . \u201d That can \u2019 t be good .\nWe are also less confident in our institutions \u2013 even those that have nothing to do with the economy . Confidence in religion , for instance , is at an all-time low . Only 44 % of Americans believe in the church or organized religion , according to Gallup , down from 52 % in 2009 . Confidence in our public schools also hit a new record low this year . Only 29 % of Americans are positive about our schools -- compared to 33 % four years ago .\nIn fact , we as a nation are pretty down on our police , big business , organized labor , newspapers , the Supreme Court , Congress and banks ; confidence in each is way below historical averages .\nHow about this one ? Only 37 % of Americans express confidence in the presidency \u2013 as an institution \u2013 compared with 45 % in the past . Faith in big government ? At 30 % - a new low , and down from 41 % in 2008 .\nThese are terrible signs . A country that has little faith in its governing institutions will not rally behind those institutions . Such lack of confidence saps our willingness to abide by our laws and could eventually lead to increased corruption .\nIs President Obama to blame for this slide ? No , but he surely hasn \u2019 t done anything to reverse it .\nThe tales of monies being funneled to Obama donors in the green energy space , the bankruptcy of Solyndra , the nonsensical hand-outs discovered in the stimulus , the explosion in food stamp spending , the willingness of the president to circumvent the law through executive orders , the questionable use of drones to kill persons unknown , the political cowardice that has blocked the Senate from enacting a budget \u2013 the list goes on and on .\nPrincipally , however , the nation is discouraged by our inability to get back on track .
