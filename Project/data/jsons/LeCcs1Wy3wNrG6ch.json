    "content": "A long-term Afghanistan security pact was in jeopardy Tuesday after Afghan President Hamid Karzai made new demands , prompting the United States to threaten to withdraw all forces after 2014 .\nThe Afghan president signaled he was not prepared to sign the agreement during a meeting with U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice . According to the White House , he outlined `` new conditions '' for signing it , just days after a tentative deal had been reached .\nThe White House said Monday that Rice responded by saying this would mean the U.S. would then start planning to pull out all its forces after 2014 , adding that a signed agreement is necessary to plan for thousands of troops to stay in the country to train and mentor Afghan security forces to face the Taliban .\n`` Without a prompt signature , the U.S. would have no choice but to initiate planning for a post-2014 future in which there would be no U.S. or NATO troop presence in Afghanistan , '' she told the Afghan president .\nTheir meeting in Kabul came the day after Karzai 's surprise decision to ignore Sunday 's recommendation by an Afghan assembly of dignitaries to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement , a refusal that cast doubt on whether American and allied troops would remain in Afghanistan to train Afghan forces after most foreign troops withdraw next year .\nAccording to Karzai 's office , he told Rice during Monday 's meeting that he would n't back down from that decision , deferring it to whoever succeeds him as president in April elections .\nKarzai announced his decision at a gathering of 2,500 tribal elders and regional leaders known as a Loya Jirga , even though the council not only overwhelmingly approved the deal after a four-day meeting but urged him to sign it by Dec. 31 .\nWashington has asked him to change his mind . But the mercurial Karzai , in the meeting with Rice , says he laid out a series of new demands -- albeit ones mostly involving steps the U.S. has already said it would take .\nOne new demand was that the United States should address a suggestion by the Loya Jirga that all Afghan prisoners be released from Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .\nAccording to the statement , Karzai `` said the United States of America should respond to the suggestion mentioned in the resolution of the Loya Jirga to free all the Afghan prisoners in Guantanamo . ''\nThere are nearly 20 Afghans currently being held at the American facility in Cuba .\nKarzai 's office said that in the meeting with Rice , he also asked for further assurances from the United States that its forces will not raid Afghan homes and that America express a sincere commitment to help start stalled peace talks with the Taliban . He also reiterated his demand that the United States commit to holding free and transparent elections on April 5 .\nThe statement further added that Karzai asked Rice to convey his concerns about the raids and peace talks to President Barack Obama so that he can `` give assurances regarding the issues to the Afghan people . ''\nObama has already addressed the issue of raids in a letter to Karzai last week that was read to the assembly .\nIn it , Obama assured Karzai that under the agreement , the U.S. will continue to respect `` Afghan sovereignty . '' He also said the U.S. military will not conduct raids on homes except under `` extraordinary circumstances '' involving urgent risks to U.S. nationals .\nThe US has repeatedly urged Karzai to sign a deal that would allow about 8,000 American troops to stay in the country beyond a 2014 withdrawal deadline .\nThe two-term Afghan leader has insisted that the winner of an April 5 election to succeed him should be the one to sign the deal . More than $ 8 billion in annual funds for Afghanistan 's fledgling security forces and development assistance also are at stake .\nKarzai may be concerned about his legacy , worried he might be seen as responsible for an agreement that some Afghans will likely see as selling out to foreign interests .\nKarzai 's statement said that Rice told the Afghan president that the U.S. was committed to transparent elections that will be held on time and without interference as prescribed by Afghan law .\nIt added that Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , the top U.S. and coalition commander , told Karzai he had ordered his troops `` to act according to the security agreement and suggestions of the consultative Loya Jirga . ''\nBut is also said Rice did not provide a commitment on the peace talks .\nKarzai has blamed the United States for the collapse of talks that were to be held at a Taliban office in the Gulf State of Qatar .\nThe Taliban office , which opened in Doha last June after talks between the United States and Qatar , closed after Karzai accused the religious movement of trying to set up a government-in-exile by identifying its office as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan .\nA furious Karzai told the Loya Jirga delegates on Sunday that Obama had promised him the Taliban would not open an embassy .\nRice met with Karzai at the end of a previously unannounced three-day trip to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops and civilians for the Thanksgiving holidays , the White House said , adding that the meeting was at Karzai 's request .
