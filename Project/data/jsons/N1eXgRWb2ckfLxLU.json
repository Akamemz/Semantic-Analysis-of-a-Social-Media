Union leaders now say the president 's actions give them new protections -- and are keen on signing them up .\n`` I think we 'll see very positive changes '' because of the action , Tom Balanoff , president of Service Employees International Union Local 1 , told The Associated Press . `` One of them , I hope , is that more workers will come forward and want to organize . ''\nEven before the president 's announcement -- which infuriated congressional Republicans -- labor unions were pushing the president to use executive powers to ease immigration policy .\nOn the day of Obama 's decision , the AFL-CIO 's Richard Trumka said the move would `` allow millions of people to live and work without fear , and afford them the status to assert their rights on the job . ''\nIndeed , the AFL-CIO now says it 's training organizers to recruit eligible workers .\nThe SEIU , whose more than 2 million members include janitors and maintenance workers , recently announced a website where immigrants can learn about the action .

The ranks fell by more than 1.2 million between 2003 and 2013 , when there were about 14.5 million members nationwide , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
