But to borrow a line from Campaign 1992 , `` It 's the economy , stupid . ''\nThat slogan was the most important wall hanging in the Little Rock headquarters of the Bill Clinton presidential campaign , the strategic imperative strategists James Carville and Paul Begala imposed on a campaign that often , especially early on , seemed to be careening into questions of character and credibility .\nFast forward 22 years , and a variation of `` It 's the economy , stupid '' is what the White House and vulnerable Democrats on the 2014 ballot had hoped would be their best weapon against GOP attacks -- and against the history of midterm elections . And it is the economy -- and voter perception of the economy -- that is making it so difficult for Obama to improve his political standing .\nThere are numbers to support the Democratic case that things are better -- especially when compared to the deep recession Obama inherited in January 2009 .\nJust Friday , the Labor Department reported the April 2014 unemployment rate to be 6.3 % -- down from 6.7 % in March and the lowest jobless rate since September 2008 . More context -- and ammunition for the White House case that the trajectory of the economy is now strong : April 's unemployment rate is down from 7.5 % a year ago , and from 9 % in April 2009 , a few months into the Obama presidency .\nHelping push the rate down : the economy added 288,000 jobs last month -- the best month-to-month gain in more than two years .\nDuring a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday , Obama highlighted April 's growth in jobs and gave the American people credit for their `` grit and determination '' for the economic rebound .\nAdd in this : the Dow closed Thursday at 16,558 , a tad off a record high hit Wednesday . That 's more than double the April 30 , 2009 , close : 8,168 .\nNow , in the political debate over the economy , the question is this : will Americans process the drop in the jobless rate and a strong monthly jobs number as proof the recovery has deep roots , or as just another month on the roller coaster ?\nJUST WATCHED Min . wage ; Obama climate ; Benghazi email Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Dems . on Benghazi ; Bush 43 on Jeb 01:39\nThe question is very real , in part because as Democrats try to focus on the `` good '' data , there is consistent competition from less encouraging and , at times , quite discouraging numbers .\nThe government on Wednesday , for example , reported that the economy stalled significantly in the first quarter of 2014 -- with the GDP increasing just 0.1 % .\nAnd even in Friday 's unemployment report there is fodder for the pessimists : the workforce shrunk by 806,000 people -- meaning there were fewer people actively looking for work . Plus , the number of long-term unemployed -- those without jobs for 27 weeks or longer -- stands at 3.5 million people .\nThe liberal Economic Policy Institute attributed the decline of the unemployment rate in April `` entirely due to people dropping out of the labor force . '' Its estimate of what EPI calls `` missing workers '' -- people who are not working or actively seeking work -- is a record 6.2 million Americans . Count them , and the real unemployment rate would be 9.9 % .\nHouse Speaker John Boehner called the exodus from the workforce `` troubling '' and said , `` we need more robust economic growth if we 're going to help the millions who remain unemployed get back on their feet . ''\nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Republicans were in the way of creating more jobs and helping the long-term unemployed .\n`` The Republican approach shows nothing but contempt and disregard for working families , '' Pelosi said in a statement .\nHere is what to watch between now and Election Day :\n* Will robust month to month job growth become the norm ?\n* Will the jobless rate fall to or below 6 % ?\n* And , perhaps most importantly in the political context , will voter sentiment about the economy shift in any significant way ?\nAt the moment , that sentiment is negative -- and a major drag on the President 's political standing .\nTwo national surveys this week offered sobering numbers on the `` right track/wrong track '' question :\nThe NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found 63 % of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track .\nAn ABC/Washington Post poll put the `` wrong track '' number at 66 percent .\nIn that ABC/Post survey , just 28 % of Americans described economic conditions as getting better . So more than seven in 10 Americans think the economy is treading water or getting worse .\nIn the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey , 41 % of Americans said the economy had improved some and Obama deserved some credit . Seventeen percent said it had improved but that the President did n't deserve much credit . Forty-two percent said it had not really improved .\nGOP pollster Bill McInturff says history is clear on the question : `` Here is a rule that no President has been able to beat yet in an off-year election : high wrong track and weak economic confidence are crippling to the electoral prospects of the party that controls the presidency . ''\nThat economic pessimism is the source of considerable frustration at the White House . There , the parallel to 1992 is striking . Then -- a presidential year not a midterm -- the growth numbers were far more robust than now .\nBut the pain of the early 1990s recession had left deep scars and the Bush political operation was unable to make a persuasive case things were on the upswing and that he deserved the credit .\nThis time , in the off year , Democratic strategist Margie Omero says it is imperative that her party not let all the political blame fall on the President .\n`` I do n't see Republicans convincing people they have a plan for the economy that people like , or , frankly , that they have much of a plan for the economy at all , '' Omero said .\nShe also made the case -- and the polling data backs this up -- that the Republican brand is severely tainted at the moment , and that in most cases Democrats have an edge when voters are asked which party they trust more on economic fairness questions .\n`` That said , I think the constant fighting and inaction in Washington hurts both parties ' image , even if it generally hurts Republicans more , '' Omero said . `` And Democrats have certainly lost elections before while still having the advantage on the issues . ''\nThe Democrats ' election-year strategy includes a focus on economic issues where the party believes it can draw sharp contrasts with Republicans , among them equal pay and an increase in the minimum wage .\nWorking against the Democratic effort , however , or at least complicating it , is a voter crisis of confidence when it comes to political leadership . Recent Gallup polling is instructive on this question :\n* Just 42 % of Americans are confident about Obama 's economic prescriptions . `` Not surprisingly , given his low ratings on the economy , it is a drag on the overall approval rating , '' the GOP 's McInturff said .\n* Only 35 % voice confidence about Democratic leaders in Congress on the economy .\n* And an anemic 24 % say they are confident Republican congressional leaders would do the right thing about the economy .",
