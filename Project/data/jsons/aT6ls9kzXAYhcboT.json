Instead , the Senate holds short sessions every three days to keep that body open . The Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution specifies that at noon on Jan. 3 , the 114th Congress shall expire , and the 115th Congress shall begin .\nMinutes before noon on Tuesday , Congress is expected to adjourn sine die , which would end the outgoing Congress , putting both the House and Senate in recess . Then precisely at noon , the new Congress would be called into session and new members sworn in .\nSome Democrats are pushing President Barack Obama to take those few fleeting moments to appoint Garland to the nation \u2019 s highest court . If the move succeeded , then for the next twelve months the U.S. Supreme Court would have a reliably liberal majority\u2014in fact , the most liberal in all of American history . That appointment would then expire next January , at which point President Trump would be able to nominate a replacement to fill a lifetime-tenured jurist to Justice Antonin Scalia \u2019 s seat . But conservatives dread the thought of what could happen during the intervening twelve months .\nPresident Obama tried using his recess appointment power in 2012 to force through several controversial nominees who could not get through even a Democratic-controlled Senate . His unprecedented move ended up before the Supreme Court in 2014 , where the justices unanimously\u2014without a single dissent\u2014ruled his actions unconstitutional in NLRB v. Noel Canning .\nIn that decision\u2014the first High Court decision ever to explore the meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause\u2014the justices split between two opinions . One was an originalist opinion for the four conservative-leaning justices authored by the late Justice Scalia , whom Garland was nominated to succeed . But the majority opinion was written by Justice Stephen Breyer , for the liberal and moderate justices .\nUnder the controlling standard announced by the Supreme Court , Garland can not be appointed to the Supreme Court .\nJustice Breyer explained in Noel Canning \u201c that the phrase \u2018 the recess \u2019 applies to both intra-session and inter-session recesses . If a Senate recess is so short that it does not require the consent of the House [ meaning less than three days ] , it is too short to trigger the Recess Appointments Clause . And a recess lasting less than 10 days is presumptively too short as well . \u201d\nThe majority continued , \u201c In an unusual instance , where a matter is important enough to the Senate , that body can remain in session , preventing recess appointments by refusing to take a recess . \u201d\nThe Court further held \u201c that , for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause , the Senate is in session when it says it is , provided that , under its own rules , it retains the capacity to transact Senate business . \u201d\nThe standard we apply is consistent with the Constitution \u2019 s broad delegation of authority to the Senate to determine how and when to conduct its business . The Constitution explicitly empowers the Senate to \u201c determine the Rules of its Proceedings. \u201d Art . I , \u00a75 , cl . 2 .
