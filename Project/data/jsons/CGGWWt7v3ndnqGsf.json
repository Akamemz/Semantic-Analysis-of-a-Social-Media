    "content": "In California , as in Texas , public pressure is part of the political equation . \u201c My civil liberties are to be able to come to our beach \u2013 the beach I pay taxes for , \u201d says educator Penny Fraumeni in Newport Beach .\nIn Texas , the phased reopening is being guided by science and data , the governor says , albeit with caveats that in a large and diverse state a one-size-fits-all approach may be counterproductive . In particular he points to a decline in the \u201c test-positivity rate , \u201d or the percentage of tests that have been returned positive , and hospital systems that aren \u2019 t overwhelmed with patients .\nBoth are pursuing a reopening of their economies amid a pandemic , though California \u2019 s opening will be slower . Both are balancing their own authority with some local autonomy . And both say data and science are driving their decisions , even at a time when a lot remains unknown about how to track and contain the COVID-19 disease .\nThe nation \u2019 s two most populous states are culturally and economically a world apart . Yet for California \u2019 s Democratic governor and the Republican at the helm in Texas , what may be most interesting for now are some leadership similarities .\nAt what point does the nonessential become essential again ? And what is essential , anyway ?\nEducated minds may disagree , especially if you \u2019 re leading a state during a pandemic . Just ask Gavin Newsom and Greg Abbott .\nThe governors of California and Texas , respectively , don \u2019 t agree on much \u2013 including how to respond to the coronavirus pandemic . On May 1 , for example , as the Texas governor was allowing some businesses to reopen , the California governor closed beaches in Orange County .\nStill , in recent weeks they have found themselves following similar paths as they reopen in stages and lead their states into the uncertainty of a post-lockdown , pre-vaccine world .\nAmid conflicting pressures from citizens , both governors are now pursuing a degree of reopening . Both find themselves balancing their own authority with some local autonomy . And both say data and science are driving their decisions , even at a time when a lot remains unknown about how to track and contain the COVID-19 disease .\nMr. Abbott , a Republican , has prioritized a quick reopening of businesses while Mr. Newsom , a Democrat , is taking a more cautious approach . California has seen more coronavirus deaths than Texas and many other states .\nThe reopening efforts could showcase the possibilities of regional flexibility within states , but also remain fraught with challenges .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very worried about the states , \u201d says G. William Hoagland , senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center , a centrist think tank in Washington , which recommends that the U.S. triple its coronavirus testing capacity in the next several weeks . \u201c Most states have opened up too broadly , too quickly . But digging down below the aggregate state level , and looking at counties and localities , obviously you get a different picture . \u201d\nThe pressures facing governors around the nation are evident in Shelley Luther \u2019 s salon in Dallas .\nSince she reopened her salon on April 24 , in defiance of state and local orders , Ms. Luther has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for people around the country demanding the easing of virus-related restrictions . Business has been busier during the pandemic than before it , she says .\n\u201c People are proud of what we \u2019 ve been doing ... and want to come and support us , \u201d she added in a May 2 interview .\n\u201c The government was not helping us the way they said they would , \u201d she says , citing the worries local businesses face about paying their mortgages and seeking emergency loans .\nOn May 5 , a civil court judge in Dallas sentenced her to a week in jail and a fine of at least $ 3,500 for defying state and county orders . Ms. Luther , who says she doesn \u2019 t know anyone who has contracted COVID-19 , told Judge Eric Moy\u00e9 that \u201c feeding my kids is not selfish . \u201d\n\u201c The rule of law governs us , \u201d the judge said . \u201c People can not take it upon themselves to determine what they will and will not do . \u201d\nBut the pandemic has decimated the Texas economy . And while 66 % of Texas voters consider the coronavirus a serious crisis , 72 % are \u201c extremely \u201d or \u201c very \u201d concerned about the national economy , according to a Texas Tribune/University of Texas at Austin poll .\nThis has seen Governor Abbott seize command of when and how the state returns to work , says Joshua Blank , research director at the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin .\n\u201c Now the purpose is to limit the public health consequences to an acceptable level in service of restarting the economy , \u201d he adds . \u201c That acceptable level is going to be determined solely by the governor going forward , which I \u2019 ll say is a pretty big gamble on his part . \u201d\nEric Gay/AP Texas Gov . Greg Abbott holds the Governor 's Report to Reopen Texas book during a news conference where he announced he would relax some restrictions imposed on businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic , on April 27 , 2020 , in Austin , Texas .\nSince May 1 malls , museums , restaurants , and movie theaters have been allowed to reopen at 25 % of their total capacity . Hair salons are being allowed to open on May 8 , and gyms on May 18 . This is a slight acceleration from Governor Abbott \u2019 s original plan of \u201c Phase 2 \u201d starting \u201c as early as May 18 , \u201d but it \u2019 s combined with social-distancing guidelines ( though they can \u2019 t be enforced with penalties ) , scaling to 30,000 tests per day , and mobilizing a team of 4,000 \u201c contact tracers \u201d by May 11 .\nThe phased reopening is being guided by science and data , the governor says , albeit with caveats that in a large and diverse state a one-size-fits-all approach may be counterproductive . Counties with fewer than five active cases \u2013 108 of the state \u2019 s 254 counties right now \u2013 can open businesses to 50 % their total capacity , for example . The governor has also issued special guidance for nursing homes and Texans over 65 , who make up 70 % of fatalities in the state .\nIn particular he points to a decline in the \u201c test-positivity rate , \u201d or the percentage of tests that have been returned positive , and that hospital systems aren \u2019 t overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients .\nIn that context , some have criticized his plan as too modest .\n\u201c If you look at the data , in Texas and most states it \u2019 s safe to reopen maybe even more aggressively than we have , \u201d says Kevin Roberts , a part-time member of the governor \u2019 s advisory group on reopening the state and executive director of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been told to watch data , flatten the curve . Well what have we been doing ? Watching data , flattening curve . Now we \u2019 re here , the goalposts have moved , \u201d he adds , referencing critics of the governor \u2019 s plan \u2013 notably local Democratic leaders .\nThe critics , however , say they \u2019 re using the same goal posts as health officials advising the governor and President Donald Trump .\nWhite House guidelines for reopening recommend a two-week decline in documented cases before states start reopening . A paper co-authored by Dr. Mark McClellan , one of Governor Abbott \u2019 s advisers and a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner , also recommends waiting for a two-week decline , as well as waiting until a state can test everyone with COVID-19 symptoms .\nOver the weekend , the state added more than 2,000 cases \u2013 its highest increase since the outbreak began . To date , 884 Texans have died .\nTexas is near the bottom when it comes to per capita testing in the country . But if the state expands testing and contact tracing as it plans to , those are good indicators to track as businesses reopen , says Luis Ostrosky , an infectious disease specialist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston . So are the social distancing guidelines \u2013 set out in the governor \u2019 s plan .\n\u201c If we follow these rules carefully we \u2019 re going to be successful , and if we don \u2019 t there \u2019 s a mechanism to scale back , as painful as it may be , \u201d says Dr. Ostrosky .\nIndeed , Governor Abbott has given himself the ability to accelerate or reverse on easing restrictions . His order also supersedes any local orders that may conflict with it .\nDavid J. Phillip/AP Nyha Carter ( left ) helps Brianna Fregia inside a Journeys shoe store in The Woodlands , Texas , on May 5 , 2020 . The Woodlands Mall reopened Tuesday with increased health and safety measures in place , as the state 's governor eased coronavirus-related restrictions on the economy .\nIn Bexar County , which includes most of San Antonio , for example , face coverings are still \u201c required \u201d even though the governor \u2019 s order means such local ordinances can \u2019 t be enforced .\nIn Dallas County , home to Ms. Luther \u2019 s salon , County Judge Clay Jenkins worries Governor Abbott is moving too fast on reopening .\n\u201c We have not seen the death and disease that [ other major ] urban areas have seen , but it doesn \u2019 t mean we couldn \u2019 t still have that , \u201d he says .\nOn the ground , the first week of Texas \u2019 s reopening has been fairly muted . Some restaurants haven \u2019 t reopened to dine-in customers , in part because of the time it would take to set up . Many movie theaters and museums have stayed closed \u2013 including the Governor \u2019 s mansion in Austin \u2013 and shoppers seem to be venturing out in trickles instead of droves .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to take a while to build that confidence up . People are cautious with their spending , they don \u2019 t know what the future holds , \u201d says Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff . \u201c There \u2019 s going to be a reluctance to move forward , but we just have to deal with it . \u201d\nIn Newport Beach , California , you couldn \u2019 t miss the sign : \u201c Beach area temporarily closed. \u201d All caps . Red letters . It was posted on a sandwich board just steps from Penny Fraumeni \u2019 s front door on the corner of 35th Street and paradise .\nNor could you miss the police helicopters , which twice passed over the handful of scattered sunbathers on Newport Beach last Saturday , asking people to vacate the area .\nMs. Fraumeni , visiting her family \u2019 s oceanside cottage from her home in Hacienda Heights , did not move from her isolated beach chair . Nor did she cease reading \u201c The 13-Minute Murder \u201d by James Patterson .\n\u201c My civil liberties are to be able to come to our beach \u2013 the beach I pay taxes for , \u201d says the educator in sunglasses . In her view , Governor Newsom violated those rights when he closed this and all beaches in Orange County on May 1 , citing crowds at a time when Californians need to practice social distancing . For seven weeks , Ms. Fraumeni has obeyed the governor \u2019 s statewide lockdown \u2013 the first in the nation . But when he overruled the city council \u2019 s vote last week to keep the beach open , that was \u201c over the top , \u201d she believes .\nRich Pedroncelli/AP California Gov . Gavin Newsom gestures during a news conference at the Governor 's Office of Emergency Services in Rancho Cordova , California , on April 14 , 2020 . Mr. Newsom is allowing a degree of local autonomy in reopening , but this week criticized a few counties that have defied his baseline conditions .\nThe governor appears to have heard that message \u2013 to a degree .\nOn Monday , he announced that the Golden State would take the first steps to reopen California \u2019 s economy , beginning Friday with curb-side pickup for \u201c lower risk \u201d retailers like bookstores , clothing stores , and florists ( it \u2019 s almost Mother \u2019 s Day , after all ) . Perhaps more notable , he \u2019 s loosening the reins on local communities , allowing them to open further if they meet certain virus-containment criteria . Counties less affected by the virus , including four with no confirmed cases , have been clamoring for local autonomy , and a few have gone ahead with reopening . They \u2019 re backed by swarms of vociferous protesters .\nBut while the governor has publicly empathized with the protesters , he maintains that it is science and data \u2013 not politics and pushback \u2013 that are allowing him to start to gradually reopen the state . That , and the vigilance of Californians staying home and practicing social distancing .\n\u201c He is a data-driven guy , \u201d says Zev Yaroslavsky , a former Los Angeles politician now with the University of California in Los Angeles . \u201c In this instance , the data-driven approach is perfect for the crisis we have . \u201d\nWhen mayor of San Francisco , Mr. Newsom joined the management trend in cities like Baltimore and New York , measuring city services and budgets through a data system known as \u201c SFStat . \u201d\nHe repeatedly comes back to key metrics guiding a gradual reopening of this vast and varied \u201c nation-state , \u201d as he often calls it . On Monday , he pointed to a \u201c report card \u201d that showed a two-week stabilization in hospitalizations and a slight decline in COVID-19-related stays in intensive care units . The state is \u201c on schedule \u201d with personal protective equipment , health care surge capacity , and testing and contact tracing capability , according to the report card .\nFrancine Kiefer/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Erin Crane holds her terrier-mix , Ridley , in front of her home in Newport Beach , California , on May 2 , 2020 . `` I 'm a rule follower . We do what we need to do for the common good , '' she says of the governor 's recent order to close the beaches in her county .\nThe number of coronavirus-related deaths in California has declined for the first time , week over week . With more than 2,400 such deaths reported so far , California is in far better shape than New York ( more than 24,000 ) .\nBut there \u2019 s \u201c a lot we still don \u2019 t know \u201d about the data and science of the virus , says Emily Blodget , an expert on infectious diseases at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles . Political leaders may look for a decline in cases for their guide , but more testing is bound to reveal more cases , says Dr. Blodget . The most reliable guides for decision-making are hospitalizations and ICU stays , she says .\nCalifornians broadly back the governor \u2019 s cautious , data-based approach , with 70 % of voters approving his job performance , according to one poll released on May 1 . Similarly , 70 % say they are more concerned that the shelter-in-place orders will end too soon , causing the virus to spread more , than are worried the orders will go on for too long , causing greater economic damage . More than 4 million people in California have filed for unemployment benefits \u2013 with more coming .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a rule follower . We do what we need to do for the common good , \u201d says Erin Crane , holding her terrier-mix Ridley in front of her home in Newport Beach . The mother of two resides just paces away from a stunning cliff view of the ocean . She wears a mask on her walks , though many residents don \u2019 t .\nThe Southern California heat wave that sent people seeking ocean sun and fun two weekends ago \u2013 and which prompted the governor \u2019 s crackdown \u2013 caused chaos on her street of closely packed homes , she says . The beach itself was less of an issue , but with the beach parking lot closed , cars and maskless pedestrians crammed the streets and sidewalks . She \u2019 s glad the governor closed the beach . \u201c It \u2019 s unfortunate , but we need to stay healthy . \u201d\nIn some cases , communities that want more freedom to open up are throwing their own data back at the governor . Orange County has experienced 61 COVID-19 deaths so far \u2013 out of a population of 3.2 million . The local hospital has a 475-bed capacity , with never more than 25 people in beds at any time , maintains Mayor Will O \u2019 Neill . There is no ventilator shortage .\nFrancine Kiefer/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Newport Beach Council member Joy Brenner points to Corona Del Mar beach in California on May 2 , 2020 . California Gov . Gavin Newsom had closed the beach the day before . Although she supported closure for safety reasons , she believes locals should have a say in such decisions .\n\u201c I know this governor has talked quite a bit about ... putting data over politics . So if he needs more data , we \u2019 ll be happy to provide more data , \u201d said the mayor , after a special council session Saturday .\nNow the state and oceanside communities are working together , and this week reached agreements to open up several major beaches , including Newport Beach . The agreements allow activities such as walking , surfing , and jogging , but no passive games or sunbathing .\nOrange County was once a GOP bastion , and many people here feel like the Democratic governor is sticking it to them . Some local politicians are playing up the division through legal action . Regrettably , \u201c it \u2019 s now getting really political , \u201d says Newport Beach council member Joy Brenner . Still , she agrees that localities should have more say in reopening . \u201c I don \u2019 t think one-size-fits-all is the answer . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

This week he criticized a few counties that have defied his baseline conditions and are allowing higher-risk businesses like malls , gyms , and full-service restaurants to open . \u201c They \u2019 re making a big mistake .

Mr. Newsom is allowing a degree of local autonomy in reopening, but this week criticized a few counties that have defied his baseline conditions.\n\nThe governor appears to have heard that message \u2013 to a degree.\n\nOn Monday, he announced that the Golden State would take the first steps to reopen California\u2019s economy, beginning Friday with curb-side pickup for \u201clower risk\u201d retailers like bookstores, clothing stores, and florists (it\u2019s almost Mother\u2019s Day, after all). Perhaps more notable, he\u2019s loosening the reins on local communities, allowing them to open further if they meet certain virus-containment criteria. Counties less affected by the virus, including four with no confirmed cases, have been clamoring for local autonomy, and a few have gone ahead with reopening. They\u2019re backed by swarms of vociferous protesters.\n\nBut while the governor has publicly empathized with the protesters, he maintains that it is science and data \u2013 not politics and pushback \u2013 that are allowing him to start to gradually reopen the state. That, and the vigilance of Californians staying home and practicing social distancing.\n\n\u201cHe is a data-driven guy,\u201d says Zev Yaroslavsky, a former Los Angeles politician now with the University of California in Los Angeles. \u201cIn this instance, the data-driven approach is perfect for the crisis we have.\u201d\n\nWhen mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Newsom joined the management trend in cities like Baltimore and New York, measuring city services and budgets through a data system known as \u201cSFStat.\u201d\n\nHe repeatedly comes back to key metrics guiding a gradual reopening of this vast and varied \u201cnation-state,\u201d as he often calls it. On Monday, he pointed to a \u201creport card\u201d that showed a two-week stabilization in hospitalizations and a slight decline in COVID-19-related stays in intensive care units. The state is \u201con schedule\u201d with personal protective equipment, health care surge capacity, and testing and contact tracing capability, according to the report card.\n\nFrancine Kiefer/The Christian Science Monitor Erin Crane holds her terrier-mix, Ridley, in front of her home in Newport Beach, California, on May 2, 2020. \"I'm a rule follower. We do what we need to do for the common good,\" she says of the governor's recent order to close the beaches in her county.\n\nThe number of coronavirus-related deaths in California has declined for the first time, week over week. With more than 2,400 such deaths reported so far, California is in far better shape than New York (more than 24,000).\n\nBut there\u2019s \u201ca lot we still don\u2019t know\u201d about the data and science of the virus, says Emily Blodget, an expert on infectious diseases at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Political leaders may look for a decline in cases for their guide, but more testing is bound to reveal more cases, says Dr. Blodget. The most reliable guides for decision-making are hospitalizations and ICU stays, she says.\n\nCalifornians broadly back the governor\u2019s cautious, data-based approach, with 70% of voters approving his job performance, according to one poll released on May 1. Similarly, 70% say they are more concerned that the shelter-in-place orders will end too soon, causing the virus to spread more, than are worried the orders will go on for too long, causing greater economic damage. More than 4 million people in California have filed for unemployment benefits \u2013 with more coming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a rule follower. We do what we need to do for the common good,\u201d says Erin Crane, holding her terrier-mix Ridley in front of her home in Newport Beach. The mother of two resides just paces away from a stunning cliff view of the ocean. She wears a mask on her walks, though many residents don\u2019t.\n\nThe Southern California heat wave that sent people seeking ocean sun and fun two weekends ago \u2013 and which prompted the governor\u2019s crackdown \u2013 caused chaos on her street of closely packed homes, she says. The beach itself was less of an issue, but with the beach parking lot closed, cars and maskless pedestrians crammed the streets and sidewalks. She\u2019s glad the governor closed the beach. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but we need to stay healthy.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, communities that want more freedom to open up are throwing their own data back at the governor. Orange County has experienced 61 COVID-19 deaths so far \u2013 out of a population of 3.2 million. The local hospital has a 475-bed capacity, with never more than 25 people in beds at any time, maintains Mayor Will O\u2019Neill. There is no ventilator shortage.\n\nFrancine Kiefer/The Christian Science Monitor Newport Beach Council member Joy Brenner points to Corona Del Mar beach in California on May 2, 2020. California Gov. Gavin Newsom had closed the beach the day before. Although she supported closure for safety reasons, she believes locals should have a say in such decisions.\n\n\u201cI know this governor has talked quite a bit about ... putting data over politics. So if he needs more data, we\u2019ll be happy to provide more data,\u201d said the mayor, after a special council session Saturday.\n\nNow the state and oceanside communities are working together, and this week reached agreements to open up several major beaches, including Newport Beach. The agreements allow activities such as walking, surfing, and jogging, but no passive games or sunbathing.\n\nOrange County was once a GOP bastion, and many people here feel like the Democratic governor is sticking it to them. Some local politicians are playing up the division through legal action. Regrettably, \u201cit\u2019s now getting really political,\u201d says Newport Beach council member Joy Brenner. Still, she agrees that localities should have more say in reopening. \u201cI don\u2019t think one-size-fits-all is the answer.\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
