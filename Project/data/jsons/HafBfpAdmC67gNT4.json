It was not a good night for President Obama because even if he scored debating points , he lost the argument .\nThe narrative going into this debate was that President Obama would come out more aggressive , on the offense . That sort of happened , but I think people looked at that and did n't really like it .\nObama needed to dominate by having a vision and instead he came out tonight and went after Romney , which worked more to the disadvantage of the president than Romney .\nElections are about the future and not the past and the status quo does n't win elections .
