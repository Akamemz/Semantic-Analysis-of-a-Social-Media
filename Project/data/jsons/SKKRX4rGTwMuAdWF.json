    "content": "President Trump blessed House Republicans \u2019 compromise immigration bill \u201c 1,000 percent \u201d Tuesday , giving political cover to conservatives looking to back the bill and creating momentum ahead of a showdown vote expected this week .\nHe said the legislation , which grants citizenship rights to illegal immigrant \u201c Dreamers , \u201d funds his border wall , limits the chain of family migration and ends the visa lottery , checks off all the boxes on his immediate immigration wish list .\nMeeting with Republicans for an hour Tuesday evening , Mr. Trump told them he would welcome a fix to the family separation issue that has engulfed the immigration debate this week . But he made clear that any action would have to come from Congress , not from the administration .\nHis blessing clears up the mess he left Friday when he said he wouldn \u2019 t sign the bill . The White House later said he misunderstood the question , but his wavering left a number of conservatives fearful of voting for the bill only to have the president walk away from the legislation , leaving them on a political ledge .\n\u201c He says , \u2018 I am behind you 1,000 percent and I am not going to leave you out to dry , \u2019 \u201d said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers , Washington Republican and chairwoman of the House Republican Conference .\nWhether that is good enough to win the votes of 218 Republicans \u2014 the number needed to approve the bill \u2014 is unclear .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to be close , \u201d said Rep. Carlos Curbelo , a Florida Republican who helped craft the compromise bill . \u201c This is a very challenging issue , very controversial . All members are going to have to take some risks to make this happen . \u201d\nRep. Mark Meadows , North Carolina Republican and head of the Freedom Caucus , said he is still weighing his vote , but the bill is a no-go for other conservatives .\n\u201c I think there are some who believe that it is amnesty , and they don \u2019 t want to vote for amnesty , \u201d he said .\nHe also said some on the liberal side of the party wanted a more generous legalization for Dreamers .\n\u201c We represent very different districts , \u201d he said . \u201c The thing that motivates me to stay involved is I think the moderates negotiated in good faith \u2014 whether we get to 218 or not , I don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nRepublican leaders released the official version of the bill Tuesday evening while Mr. Trump was meeting with them .\nThe bill would grant full legal status and a path to citizenship to people who qualify for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . The bill also would end the visa lottery and limit the types of family members who can be sponsored for immigration . It takes those visas and uses them for the DACA population and other children brought to the U.S. illegally as minors by their parents .\nIn terms of enforcement , the bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to detain more people and deport them faster , and it increases the threshold for people attempting to claim asylum , with a goal of reducing fraudulent claims that have clogged the system .\nRepublican leaders tucked in a fix for the family separation issue , allowing the government to hold children and their parents in immigration detention facilities for longer than 20 days . The bill also says that illegal immigrant parents charged with misdemeanors , who normally would be sent to the criminal justice system \u2019 s jails , can be held in immigration detention \u2014 meaning they can remain with their children .\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Mr. Trump got a good reception from the party .\nOutside the meeting , a group of Democrats marched along the corridors holding signs that said , \u201c Families Belong Together , \u201d and that depicted some of the now-iconic photos of children and their parents at the border .\nAs the president walked through one of the Capitol \u2019 s corridors , a heckler shouted at him , \u201c Mr . President , F\u2013 you ! \u201d An NBC reporter said on Twitter that the culprit was a congressional intern .\nEarlier Tuesday , some of the president \u2019 s key supporters warned him against embracing the bill .\nThe National ICE Council , the union that represents officers at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , said the bill falls short on a number of the president \u2019 s campaign promises .\nChris Crane , the council president , wrote a letter to Mr. Trump saying the bill would open the door to massive fraud , would allow people who defy judges \u2019 deportation orders to get on a pathway to citizenship and would fail to make good on Mr. Trump \u2019 s promise of a deportation force of 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers .\nHe labeled the bill the \u201c Ryan amnesty \u201d and said it repeats the mistakes of the failed 2013 \u201c Gang of 8 \u201d immigration bill .\n\u201c You pledged publicly to \u2018 have the backs \u2019 of the men and women of ICE law enforcement . I am asking you to keep that promise , \u201d Mr. Crane wrote .\nThe ICE Council endorsed Mr. Trump on the campaign trail in 2016 .\nRep. Bob Goodlatte , Virginia Republican , said he is \u201c sympathetic to their concerns \u201d but that the compromise is better than alternative proposals that they would have hated .\n\u201c But we really have to do something that can get to 218 votes , and some of the people who are in that negotiation did not support their request , \u201d Mr. Goodlatte said . \u201c This happened very quickly , and if they don \u2019 t think they were consulted enough , I understand that . \u201d\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the letter .\nOne would be on an enforcement-heavy bill written months ago by Mr. Goodlatte and Rep.

It does include a host of new enforcement measures such as requiring employers to use E-Verify to check their hires , cracking down on sanctuary cities and making it a misdemeanor to overstay a visa .\nThose measures went too far for many Republicans , and the Goodlatte bill struggled to reach 218 supporters .\nSo Republican leaders pushed Mr. Goodlatte , Mr. McCaul and moderate lawmakers to work on the compromise bill .\nMr. Trump had backed the enforcement-heavy bill , but his full-throated support for the compromise was critical .\n\u201c Folks that would have been against it , I think it \u2019 s harder for them to be against it now , \u201d said Rep.
