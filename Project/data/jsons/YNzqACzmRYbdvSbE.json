    "content": "Since the Democratic convention , Hillary Clinton has opened an average lead in national polls over Donald Trump of more than 5 percent , and is posting a double-digit lead over her Republican rival in a number of traditional battleground states\u2014a lead that may to expand in light of Trump 's recent refusal to soften his stance on immigration reform . But after the F.B.I . discovered 15,000 previously undisclosed e-mails and documents in their investigation into Clinton \u2019 s e-mail practices when she served as secretary of state , the presidential hopeful is fighting another wave of criticism . The latest chapter in the candidate \u2019 s enduring e-mail scandal has prompted fresh accusations that the Democratic nominee gave preferential treatment to major Clinton Foundation donors and nurtured a \u201c pay to play \u201d culture during her State Department tenure .\nBefore the fresh wave of scandal broke , James Carville , a longtime Clinton confidant and political strategist who guided Bill Clinton \u2019 s 1992 presidential campaign , spoke to * \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 * s Hive about Clinton \u2019 s chances in the 2016 presidential election and how the party of Lincoln ended up with Trump as its nominee .\nThe Hive : So , who is going to win the election ?\nJames Carville : It \u2019 s hard to look at it right now and come to any other conclusion than it is going to be a pretty sizable win for the Democrats . It \u2019 s pretty hard to see anything else .\nWell , I mean , the demographic changes in the country are substantial , and they are changing rapidly in a way that is unfavorable to the Republican Party . And the Republicans , I would say , continue to make a bad bet . They keep doubling down on these non-college whites . This has proven to be very successful in certain parts of the country and in off-year elections , but it has not worked very well at all in presidential years . It \u2019 s working terribly now .\nBeyond those changing demographics , why is the Republican Party struggling this cycle ?\nLook , the last time we had a Republican president we had a disastrous war and a disastrous recession . To the extent that peace and prosperity matter to anybody\u2014which have traditionally been the two biggest drivers in American politics\u2014they do not bode well for the Republicans . It \u2019 s hard to expect that you are going to do very well if that \u2019 s people \u2019 s most recent memory of your party governing , in addition to being a party whose primary appeal is to the shrinking demographic that is non-college whites . In some ways it \u2019 s amazing to me that they are not doing worse . Honestly .\nTrump \u2019 s hard-core supporters are not the same people who voted for Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , or Jeb Bush . What \u2019 s happening to the Republican Party ?\nTrump came in and fit perfectly with at least half of the Republican Party , which is some version of an ethnocentric , nationalistic party that is very different from what we have traditionally seen from Republicans .
