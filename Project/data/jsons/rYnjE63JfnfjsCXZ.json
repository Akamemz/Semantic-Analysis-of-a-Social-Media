And Libertarians hope that could give them an opening .\nThe likely Democratic and Republican nominees each have historically high unfavorable numbers . Media attention for the party , both the national committee chairman and the party 's political director say , is at unprecedented levels .\nSo it is with an air of opportunity to break out of obscurity that Libertarians , members of the country 's most prominent third party , have gathered for their national convention in Orlando , Florida , this weekend to officially pick a candidate to pitch to angry voters .\nMany expect former New Mexico Gov . Gary Johnson , the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2012 , to leave Orlando Sunday evening once again his party 's standard-bearer .\nSince last week , Johnson has made the rounds touting his newly minted alliance with former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld , who is seeking the party 's vice presidential nomination . The two former governors , who both also happen to be ex-Republicans , are fielding a ticket of sorts , although the Libertarians elect their nominees separately and no formal ticket will exist at the convention until the party selects its presidential and vice presidential nominees .\nBut Johnson and Weld first have to navigate an openly hostile convention , characterized by its insular proceedings and unwelcome to moderates .\nWeld will have to overcome meaningful differences between his demonstrated policy preferences , particularly past support for gun control measures , and his willingness to support Republican politicians . Just this year , the colorful former governor endorsed Ohio Gov . John Kasich for president .\nHis supposed transgressions from Libertarian orthodoxy have earned him outright disdain from many of the party 's attendees . He received loud boos at his introduction to the party 's vice presidential debate , where he stuck to reciting his conservative bona fides and applauded his opponents on stage .\n`` We are not Republican-light , '' Larry Sharpe , a vice-presidential candidate said in a takedown of the Johnson-Weld ticket mere inches away from the former Massachusetts governor .\nAsked after the debate , Weld said he thought such attacks `` were not an issue one way or another . ''\nDespite his bruising reception , Johnson said he would strongly prefer not to continue his bid without Weld , arguing they were `` arguably the two most Libertarian governors that ever served . ''\nWeld has made headlines since his entry into the race for comparing Trump 's proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants to Kristallnacht , a 1938 pogrom remembered to this day for brutality against the Jewish people in the leadup to WWII . For his part , Johnson has said he `` absolutely '' stands by the bold comparison .\nWeld doubled down on this kind of rhetoric at the convention , saying that should Trump win the presidency , `` We will be the rogue nation .
