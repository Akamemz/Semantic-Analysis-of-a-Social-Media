You can \u2019 t show up for a week and then suddenly apply . You can \u2019 t , because borders mean something . It doesn \u2019 t apply to anybody who might come illegally in the future . \u201d\nAs he did in his address to the nation Thursday night , Mr. Obama dared congressional Republicans to pass a comprehensive immigration bill , which he said would nullify his executive actions . He rejected the argument by the GOP that his move has made it more difficult to pass such a bill because he has \u201c poisoned the well \u201d with Republicans .\n\u201c I understand that some of them are already saying that my actions sabotage their ability to pass a bill and make immigration work better , \u201d Mr. Obama said , laughing . \u201c Why ? I didn \u2019 t dissolve Parliament . That \u2019 s not how our system works . I don \u2019 t have a vote in Congress . Pass a bill . You don \u2019 t need me to a pass a bill . \u201d\nThe president signed two documents Friday directing federal agencies to carry out his executive actions , which include shielding more immigrants from possible deportation and focusing deportations more on people with criminal records .\nRepublicans in Congress who vehemently oppose Mr. Obama \u2019 s action say it will encourage more illegal immigrants to come to the U.S . There was a surge of illegal child immigrants across the U.S.-Mexico border earlier this year , in part due to the belief that they would not be returned to their homes in Central America .\nOutside the high school , protesters of the president \u2019 s actions held signs that said \u201c Impeach Obama \u201d and \u201c No Amnesty. \u201d Some chanted , \u201c Worst president ever , Obama ! \u201d\nThe president was interrupted at the rally several times with joyous chants of \u201c Si Se Puede \u201d ( Yes We Can ) , a throwback to his presidential campaigns .
