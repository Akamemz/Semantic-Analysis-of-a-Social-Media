    "content": "MIAMI \u2014 Tim Kaine is not going to be an easy target for Republicans . After all , they all but love the guy .\nAs a rank-and-file Democratic senator , Kaine has shown deal-making tendencies with top GOP lawmakers and an affinity for breaking with his own party that \u2019 s earned him respect across the aisle .\nThose traits would make him especially valuable as Hillary Clinton \u2019 s vice president : The Virginia senator would be her line into Senate Republicans , a direct conduit to a group that \u2019 s been extraordinarily reluctant to work with President Barack Obama .\nKaine \u2019 s most high-profile achievement is work in the trenches on a bill that allowed Congress a vote on Obama \u2019 s nuclear deal with Iran . Working with more conservative Democrats and deal-cutting Republicans , Kaine helped drive a 98-1 vote in the Senate , effectively forcing Obama to sign it and begin the task of lining up Democrats to support it in a roll-call vote .\n\u201c He \u2019 s sort of Biden-lite on the engagement with the Hill , \u201d said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , who \u2019 s been part of negotiating groups with Kaine on Iran and preventing terrorists from buying guns . \u201c Tim would be a good steady hand for her . He \u2019 d be well received on our side of the aisle if he \u2019 s an emissary from the president . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s not just aisle-crossing Republicans like Graham who Kaine knows well ; he 's also rubbed shoulders with the Senate \u2019 s conservative firebrand class . Upon entering the Senate , Kaine began getting to know Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , who would later run for president as a rock-ribbed hero of the right and is perhaps the least compromising lawmaker in the halls of the Capitol .\nAfter being oriented together as part of the class of 2012 , Kaine dined with Cruz at the house of independent Maine Sen. Angus King , and the two have spoken regularly about books and legal issues .\n\u201c We get along great , \u201d Kaine said of Cruz in an interview in 2014 , reported for the first time here . \u201c We \u2019 ve socialized together . Took dinners , sometimes he and I together , just the two of us . Sometimes with others . We \u2019 re often disagreeing , but we \u2019 re both serious about our work . \u201d\nIn his first rally with Clinton in South Florida on Saturday , Kaine \u2019 s centrism was in the background as the Democratic Party digested the selection of a senator who has been amenable to new trade deals and occasionally out of step with liberals on abortion issues . Clinton and Kaine instead talked up immigration reform and health care expansion \u2014 red meat for a crowd of revved-up partisans .\n\u201c And here \u2019 s how we \u2019 re going to continue that work : With a strong , progressive agenda , \u201d Kaine said emphatically .\nClose friends don \u2019 t expect Kaine to advertise his bipartisan leanings in front of most audiences .\n\u201c He won \u2019 t be talking about reaching across the aisle . But he \u2019 s got a record of doing it , \u201d said Sen. Chris Coons , a Delaware Democrat .\nDespite his reputation among Senate Republicans , at his core Kaine is an ally of Democratic leaders and Obama . He eventually supported the president \u2019 s Iran deal , as did all but four Senate Democrats . But initially the administration and its allies on the Hill were reluctant to even put the Iran deal up for a vote \u2014 a vote that the GOP was clamoring for .\nKaine \u2019 s blessing for a congressional review helped drive other Capitol Hill Democrats to the bill but also had a side benefit for Democrats : Kaine \u2019 s work with Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) made it more difficult for the GOP to try and amend the bill with conservative goodies .\n\u201c The greatest example you can point to is the role he played in fashioning the Iranian compromise , \u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota , among the most conservative Democrats in Congress . \u201c It illustrates some of the work he \u2019 s always done behind the scenes that you may not see every day . \u201d\nIndeed , the parade of cheers among some Senate Republicans is more enthusiastic for Clinton 's VP selection than for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump . Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey , who has not endorsed Trump , praised Kaine as a \u201c good choice for the Democratic ticket \u201d and highlighted all the work they \u2019 ve done together on fighting opioid addiction , sugar subsidies and keeping people with mental illnesses from obtaining guns .\nCorker , an increasingly vocal Trump backer , deemed the selection of Kaine as \u201c solid . \u201d\nBut the most hard-core partisans quickly moved to light up Kaine .\n\u201c One of President Obama 's most loyal 'yes men ' in the Senate , \u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell .\nThere \u2019 s likely to be more negativity toward Kaine as the campaign progresses , and he could lose his bipartisan sheen . Over the weekend , conservative outside groups tried to sow discord between liberals and the Clinton-Kaine ticket by highlighting positions that could rankle progressives .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t see how he can escape coming out of it as more partisan , \u201d said Mike Thomas , who ran former Republican Sen. George Allen \u2019 s campaign against Kaine in 2012 .\nIn the Senate , Kaine \u2019 s collegial manner is a throwback to another era \u2014 he \u2019 s a liberal-leaning lawmaker who simultaneously realizes that 60 votes are needed in the Senate and that his purple-state status means he needs to come off the sidelines . But perhaps even more than Kaine \u2019 s yearning for big fiscal deals and bipartisan agreements on foreign policy , his bipartisan brand of politics is driven by his belief that the Senate should vote on tough issues .\nIt \u2019 s not always welcomed by other Washington Democrats . Party leaders ignored his frequent calls for holding a vote on authorizing the war against the Islamic State , and Corker eventually shot down the idea after a retinue of media showed up with him to an otherwise dry Foreign Relations hearing last November at which Kaine tried to force the issue .\nKaine also disagreed publicly with Obama over whether the White House could escalate its presence in Syria and Iraq without Congress ' blessing . It won him new respect from Republicans for taking such a bold position .\n\u201c The president shouldn \u2019 t be doing this without Congress , \u201d Kaine said in a 2014 speech at the Center for American Progress , widely viewed as a rare rebuke of Obama . \u201c Congress shouldn \u2019 t be allowing it to happen without Congress . \u201d\nSen. Jeff Flake ( R-Ariz. ) eventually worked hand in hand with Kaine to introduce a draft bill that was shunned by both parties . But it had the benefit of deepening the relationship between the first-term senators .\n\u201c Trying to count the ways I hate [ Kaine ] . Drawing a blank . Congrats to a good man and a good friend , \u201d Flake said after Kaine was selected by Clinton . Flake has yet to endorse Trump .\nSen. Jeff Flake : `` Trying to count the ways I hate [ Kaine ] .
