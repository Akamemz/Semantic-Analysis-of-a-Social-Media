The profiles were publicly available but meaningless without knowledge of how to find them and decode the information , according to a source with knowledge of the activities .\nThe practice is the latest effort in the quest by political operatives to exploit the murky world of campaign finance laws at a time when limits on spending in politics are eroding and regulators are being defanged .\nThe law says that outside groups , such as super PACs and non-profits , can spend freely on political causes as long as they do n't coordinate their plans with campaigns . Sharing costly internal polls in private , for instance , could signal to the campaign committees where to focus precious time and resources .\nThe groups behind the operation had a sense of humor about what they were doing .
