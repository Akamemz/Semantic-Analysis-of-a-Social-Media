    "content": "In the New York Post on Wednesday , a political cartoon appeared mocking Obama \u2019 s lawyerly denial of his administration \u2019 s investigation of Trump-Russia ties . The cartoon has Obama saying : \u201c Nobody in the White House ever ordered a wiretap of the individual named Donald Trump by my specific direction during daylight hours via a normal surveillance request that I actually signed by hand with an official presidential pen . \u201d\nThe cartoon captures the public \u2019 s skepticism of Obama and its capacity for understanding the upshot of Trump \u2019 s tweets . It is no wonder that Obama this week planted stories in the press to the effect that he is \u201c livid \u201d at Trump . He is livid because Trump is exposing the soft coup that he had set in motion before leaving office . As Rush Limbaugh put it , Trump is picking up the grenades Obama tossed and throwing them back at him .\nOne of those Obama-planted grenades blew up Michael Flynn , but the real target was Trump . Like Congressman John Lewis , the Obamas do not view Trump as a legitimate president . Shortly after Lewis made that comment , Michele Obama tweeted out praise of Lewis as a civil rights hero . It was a remarkably subversive tweet , designed to telegraph support for his attack on Trump under the guise of praising Lewis \u2019 s \u201c legacy. \u201d She wrote that the example of \u201c great leaders \u201d like Lewis should be \u201c our call to action . \u201d\nIn an equally subversive tweet , Barack Obama expressed support for the anti-Trump protests , pronouncing himself \u201c heartened \u201d by them . He , of course , didn \u2019 t mention that his political network , Organizing for Action ( which grew out of Obama for America ) , had helped organize those protests .\nAs Paul Sperry reports , \u201c Obama has an army of agitators \u2014 numbering more than 30,000 \u2014 who will fight his Republican successor at every turn of his historic presidency . And Obama will command them from a bunker less than two miles from the White House . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s doing it through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action . Normally you \u2019 d expect an organization set up to support a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office , but not Obama \u2019 s OFA .
