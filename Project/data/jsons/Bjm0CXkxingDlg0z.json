    "content": "The federal government will dole out more than $ 900 billion in the top 10 tax breaks this year , according to a report Wednesday from the Congressional Budget Office that found the benefits go disproportionately to the poor and the rich .\nIndeed , the poorest 20 percent of Americans get about 12 percent of their income from the tax breaks , while the richest 20 percent get nearly 10 percent of their income from the special carve-outs , CBO said . Those in the middle get less than 8 percent of their income back in tax breaks .\nCBO \u2019 s findings are likely to reignite President Obama \u2019 s call to end some of those tax breaks and spend the increased tax revenue .\n\u201c The CBO \u2019 s report shows that tax breaks are skewed in favor of the top 1 percent of Americans at the expense of other priorities , \u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee , who said it \u2019 s time to \u201c limit unproductive and excessive tax preferences for the very wealthy . \u201d\nThe wealthy take advantage of investment tax breaks , while the poor and middle-income families will soon benefit from a new tax break to help buy health insurance under Mr. Obama \u2019 s health care law .\nOver the next decade , those tax breaks , or \u201c tax expenditures , \u201d as they are known in Washington , will total at least $ 12 trillion , which is about double the total deficit the government is expected to run over the next 10 years .\nBut CBO cautioned that eliminating tax breaks doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean that much money comes into the government , chiefly because taxpayers alter their behavior to adapt .
