''\n`` What I worry about at the moment is that because President Trump has shown such disrespect of the US national security community , including the intelligence community , it is hard for me to see how he can convince the American people of anything less than an absolute in your face threat , '' Naftali said .\nOf course , Trump is not the only President to shade the truth .\nMost recently , Obama , when selling Obamacare , told Americans that if they liked their doctor they could keep their doctor .
