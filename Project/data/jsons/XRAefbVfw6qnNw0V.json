You 've heard the president say this , that we give them tanks and the other countries give them pillows . That 's absolutely right , that as vocal as the Europeans are about supporting Ukraine , they are really , really stingy when it comes to lethal aid . And they were n't helping Ukraine . And then still to this day are not . And the president did not like that .\n`` I know it 's a long answer to your question , but I 'm still going .\n`` So that was -- those were the driving factors . Did he also mention to me in the past the -- the corruption related to the DNC server ? Absolutely , no question about that . But that 's it , and that 's why we held up the money .
