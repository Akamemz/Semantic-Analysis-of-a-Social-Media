But , if finding words for the worst is not within our power , finding them for what \u2019 s about as bad as bad can be is\u2014and that is the case with the two gun massacres that took place over the weekend , in El Paso , Texas , with twenty-two dead , and Dayton , Ohio , with nine . Though neither is the worst that we have seen in recent years , together they had a particular brutality about them .\nThose who have made gun sanity a consuming cause can only weep at these events . Figuring out what to say is hard enough ; figuring out what to do is even harder , since no more actions seem likely to result from these incidents than did from other state-sanctioned mass shootings of recent years . ( When the state , knowing what ought to be done , doesn \u2019 t do it , it sanctions what gets done instead . ) To read of Jordan Anchondo , who died of bullet wounds because she threw her body over her two-month-old son to save him , and her husband , Andre , who died beside her while trying to protect them both , is to move past tears of pity to those of rage . This should never happen . But , amid the sheer madness and horror of the killings , it seems worth making some necessary distinctions . We can \u2019 t act wisely without seeing straight , and we can \u2019 t see straight if we don \u2019 t see clearly .\nFirst point of clarity : the problem is guns , their availability , their lethality , their omnipresence in American life , and their protection by the ruling political party . There are racists in every country . There are video games in every country . There are mentally ill people in every country . There are not gun massacres in every country . And , when there is one , comprehensive new laws are passed , and there is seldom another . Why are there so many in America ? Because there are too many guns in America , and , in particular , too many lethal guns easily purchased\u2014guns modelled on military weapons whose only purpose is to kill as many people as rapidly as possible . Study after study , correlation after correlation provide the evidence on this point : control guns and you reduce gun violence . If we banned assault weapons and all their diabolic accessories , the number of gun massacres in America would be reduced\u2014as was true during the decade between 1994 and 2004 , when there was a federal ban on such weapons . We can have the same confidence in this correlation as we do in the efficacy of vaccines or antibiotics . Gun control works .\nTo say this isn \u2019 t to deny the significance of the discernible motives of the killers . Apparently , the shooting in El Paso was an act of white-supremacist terrorism , and , judging from a manifesto allegedly written by the killer , he may have taken license , if not direction , from the racist in the White House . ( The author of the manifesto said that his convictions \u201c predate Trump. \u201d ) Everything that Donald Trump does as a demagogue involves , in classic demagogic fashion , giving license to others to act on their impulses without shame . And the fact that he , in a classic demagogic move , then recoils from the consequences of his words does not make them less empowering . Trump \u2019 s rote condemnation of bigotry , during his brief comments at the White House on Monday morning\u2014seemingly authored by some other hand , and delivered with his usual insincerity , right down to his naming the wrong Ohio city\u2014 can not permit him to escape responsibility for what his more spontaneous words may have wrought . There is , of course , a difference between words that are the direct causes of violence and words that create a climate in which violence is increasingly possible , but to recognize that difference is not to clear the demagogue of blame .\nThe danger with evoking the climate as though it were the cause , however , is that there are many climates in a country as big as this one . The next gun massacre may be motivated by some form of Islamist extremism , as in San Bernardino , or by some incoherent personal motive , as at Sandy Hook , or by no discernible motive at all , as in the massacre in Las Vegas . People will find all kinds of reasons to kill . It is , crucially , the weapon in the killer \u2019 s hand that matters .\nSecond distinction : there is a difference between those who fight to make gun control impossible and those who use guns to kill people . The majority of the first , much larger group often view weapons as powerful symbols of personal autonomy . ( The deaths of innocents are , seemingly , a price necessarily paid for that idea of freedom . ) As Alec Wilkinson has written , recalling his brief time as a police officer who had a gun but used it only at a firing range , in a small Cape Cod town , \u201c a gun was an object in which a power of nature was concentrated so forcefully that a person could use one and feel party to a solemn and thrilling mystery. \u201d Most of us satisfy our appetite for a symbol of personal autonomy in the form of more nonlethal objects\u2014cars , or old guitars , or nice shoes . People who oppose gun control at every turn often cite the sense of control and power that weapons provide , regardless of how false that sense may be . The vast majority of those people will never shoot anyone , but they help put lethal weapons in the hands of those who will .\nThird distinction : the Second Amendment is , in these arguments , a red herring\u2014a blood-red herring , perhaps , but a distraction nonetheless . There is no Second Amendment guarantee of an individual \u2019 s right to own guns ; the claim that there is is a recent and radical invention of the Supreme Court , in its decision in District of Columbia v. Heller . In any case , even within the absurdities of the Heller ruling , there is plenty of room for gun restrictions .\nThe strangest thing is that there are no really rational counter-arguments to be made against gun restrictions\u2014merely the ritual invocation of the Second Amendment , misconstrued , and the argument for self-defense , which has been so often exploded that it no longer has even rhetorical weight . ( Self-defense against the kind of weapons used in mass shootings is essentially impossible . And acts of self-defense attributed to gun ownership are , at best , rare , compared with the incidence of lethal gun violence . ) In defense of the possession of lethal weapons meant for war , there is merely an appeal to \u201c culture. \u201d But , when your culture is killing children , you have to change it . Meanwhile , the solutions offered by the pro-gun lobby , parroted by Trump on Monday morning\u2014a stronger death penalty , restrictions on video games\u2014will change nothing .\nWhen we make distinctions , it frees us to act in concert\u2014it sorts out our rage into distinct , specific pieces . Mothers Against Drunk Driving did not rage against the lethal danger of guns , or of climate change , or even against the internal-combustion engine . They raged against the drunk driving that was killing kids , and they had many small and simple solutions for it : ignition locks , sobriety checkpoints , better enforcement and clearer penalties , and a broader range of protections . There are simple solutions to our gun predicament that , though far from the wider\u2014and , in other countries , universally shared\u2014restrictions and impediments we need , would change the reality . Background checks , an effective assault-weapons ban , a complete ban on large magazines , and licensing and training , and insurance , minimally comparable to those that we all accept for car ownership , for gun ownership . Even those who still want guns for their symbolic purposes can likely be persuaded to accept at least some of these restrictions .
