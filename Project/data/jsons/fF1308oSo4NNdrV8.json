In light of these late plot twists, there are now a half-dozen big questions on which the election will hinge:\n\n1. Is Obama firing blanks?\n\nThe central strategic decision of the Obama campaign was to portray Romney as an unacceptable potential president, on both personal and political grounds. This emphasis was a far more important pillar than either a sustained defense of Obama\u2019s first-term record or a detailed picture of what a second term would look like.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 newspaper endorsements)\n\nThe question is whether Romney\u2019s strong debate performance in Denver, and the more appealing persona he presented there, has fundamentally diluted the potency of Obama\u2019s anti-Romney argument. Once voters see Romney as something different than the Obama caricature, the reasoning goes, they simply won\u2019t buy the president\u2019s argument going forward. One piece of evidence for this possibility is that Romney\u2019s momentum, which began at Denver, doesn\u2019t yet seem dramatically slowed by second debate at Hofstra University, where the media consensus was that Obama had a somewhat crisper and more effective performance than his challenger.\n\nPolls should answer this question over the next week or so. The Obama response to a tightening race has been to repeat the indictment of Romney as an untrustworthy operator who favors the rich, just louder and more often.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The latest presidential polls)\n\nThe Romney hope is that Obama\u2019s negative campaign is a little like antibiotics \u2014 if they don\u2019t finish the job the first time, they lose all potency next time.\n\n2. Is Ohio insulated from national trends?\n\nAlthough national surveys vary \u2014 Romney led by 7 percentage points in Gallup\u2019s tracking poll, while the two men were tied in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll Sunday \u2014 Romney has unmistakably gained ground recently.",
