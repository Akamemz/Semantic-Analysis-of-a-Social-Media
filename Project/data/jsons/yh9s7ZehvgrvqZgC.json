( Danny Johnston/AP Photo )\nThe primary season is truly upon us as North Carolina , Ohio , and Indiana host primaries today . Twenty-five states will hold primaries in the next six weeks and today 's key one to watch will take us into a fight that will play out all over this country in the coming weeks : the establishment GOP vs. the Tea Party and whether the establishment can finally put down the Tea Party rebellion and re-take the Senate . We 'll also watch as a possible 2016 proxy fight between Jeb Bush , Rand Paul , and even Mike Huckabee erupts in North Carolina .\nWHO 'S ON THE BALLOT ? From a former American Idol runner-up to a candidate who is taking on Speaker John Boehner with an ad that ripped off a Cialis commercial , voters have several colorful candidates on their primary ballots today . Here are six things to watch for as primary season revs up :\nESTABLISHMENT VS . TEA PARTY AND A PROXY 2016 FIGHT BREWING : The Republican Senate primary in North Carolina is today 's key race and pits the establishment against the Tea Party . Thom Tillis , speaker of the North Carolina House , is the establishment candidate backed by Jeb Bush and , just yesterday , Mitt Romney . Greg Brannon , a physician , is the Tea Party and libertarian favorite and Rand Paul joined him on the campaign trail Monday calling him a `` dragon slayer . '' Mark Harris , a preacher , is the Evangelical choice who has galvanized social conservatives , and has been backed by Mike Huckabee . Huckabee recorded a robo-call on behalf of Harris that went out to 300,000 registered Republicans between Saturday to Monday . Candidates must get 40 percent of the vote to avoid a July 15 th run-off . Polls show Tillis leading with Brannon in second , but with Tillis just barely clearing that 40 percent mark . Paul 's last-minute campaign trail stop could help ensure Brannon makes it to a run-off , but that will extend the intra-party battle instead of focusing their fight against incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan . And as mentioned above , it 's also being seen as a possible 2016 proxy fight between Bush and Paul as well as Huckabee . The battle between the establishment and the Tea Party will play out in the following weeks as similar primaries are held from coast to coast , but today is our first glimpse .\nAN AMERICAN IDOL RUNNER AIMS TO BE A RUNNER UP NO MORE : American Idol 2003 runner up Clay Aiken is facing off in the Democratic primary against businessman Keith Crisco , a former state commerce secretary from Asheboro , and Toni Morris , a counselor from Fayetteville . It 's a fun celeb-tinged race to watch , but there has been no public polling in this Democratic primary so it 's difficult to predict which way this race will go . Aiken has been outspent by Crisco and he has run four television ads to Aiken 's one . Even if Aiken comes out victorious this evening it may be for naught as the winner will take on incumbent Republican Rep. Renee Elmers who is heavily favored to win . She has outraised Aiken by almost six times , but if he does win he may reel in some national Democratic money on his name recognition alone .\nA CHALLENGER FROM THE RIGHT POUNCES : Rep. Walter Jones has been representing his district for 20 years , but he is being challenged from the right by GOP consultant and former aide to President George W. Bush and the McCain campaign , Taylor Griffin . Jones is in line to be the second most senior Republican on the House Armed Services Committee , but this challenge from within his own party is one to watch . Griffin has been able to fundraise as much as Jones and Jones-who is well known for voting for the Iraq war and then becoming one of the most vocal members of the GOP against it-has become one of the most vulnerable Republicans this year . Griffin is seen as more conservative than Jones because of his foreign policy views , while Jones has tried to pit Griffin as a `` Washington insider . ''\nTHE SPEAKER GETS A CHALLENGE : House Speaker John Boehner is heading off two challengers and it has been quite a colorful race , despite Boehner being heavily favored to win . He is facing Eric Gurr , a computer consultant , and J.D . Winteregg , a high school French teacher . Boehner will win , but while past elections have been non-events he is facing challengers and some outside money being thrown at him . Boehner even ran two rounds of television ads in the district , the first time in four years . Winteregg has been able to drum up publicity for himself by releasing an online parody video in the same style as the drug Cialis . It was a not-so-subtle spin on the speaker 's first name and it claimed Winteregg offers the remedy for `` electile dysfunction '' personified by Boehner and it warns the 12-term congressman `` should n't count his chickens before they hatch . '' Winteregg ended up getting t ossed from an adjunct teaching position at Cedarville University , a Christian college , after the suggestive video aired . The Tea Party Leadership Fund , based in Virginia , has spent about $ 325,000 on behalf of Winteregg and against Boehner , according to their group 's treasurer Dan Backer . Backer said they also raised another $ 66,000 for Winteregg .
