    "content": "Last night , 12 candidates duked it out in Westerville , Ohio , in the fourth Democratic debate . Sen. Elizabeth Warren built on her past debate successes , receiving high marks from both voters who care more about defeating President Trump and voters who care more about a candidate whose positions they agree with . But she was not the only winner in the \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos \u2019 s KnowledgePanel . Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend , Indiana , and Sen. Amy Klobuchar had strong performances , too , and used the debate as an opportunity to push back on whether Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 s progressive policies are realistic .\nWe will be keeping an eye on the polls to see if Warren \u2019 s solid performance will help her pull ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden , or if Buttigieg and Klobuchar will manage to shore up more support . But for now , here \u2019 s a look at how the candidates performed , summed up in six charts :\nFirst , we wanted to see which candidates impressed the viewers we surveyed . To do this , we compared each candidate \u2019 s pre-debate favorability to debate-watchers \u2019 rating of their performance to see if any well-liked candidates disappointed during the debate or if any less-liked candidates received good ratings . By this metric , Klobuchar and Buttigieg were the two candidates who exceeded expectations given their pre-debate favorables , though Warren still received the highest debate grade overall .\nWarren performed well among voters who care about defeating Trump\nIn our poll , about two-thirds of Democratic voters said they value a candidate who has a good chance of beating Trump over someone who agrees with them on the issues \u2014 and that didn \u2019 t change after the debate . So with \u201c electability \u201d central to the election thus far , we wanted to see whether there was a difference in debate performance evaluations from respondents who said they cared about electability and respondents who said they cared about issues . Differences were small , but there are a few things that stand out .\nFirst , even though Warren has pitched herself as the \u201c issues \u201d candidate \u2014 and she did do well among voters who care about the issues \u2014 her performance also appealed to respondents who said they prioritized defeating Trump . In fact , they rated her performance higher than that of any other candidate . Sanders also got high ratings from both voters who care more about defeating Trump and voters who care more about the issues , which means candidates making more issued-based appeals can still do well among voters who care about defeating Trump . But it \u2019 s a tricky balance . Buttigieg and Biden , for instance , did not do quite as well among voters who cared about the issues , but they did almost as well as Warren among voters who care about beating Trump .\nHow voters who care about the issues , defeating Trump rated the candidates How well debate-watchers thought candidates performed in the fourth Democratic debate , by which type of candidate they prefer Type of candidate preferred candidate Similar issue positions Able to beat trump Warren 3.1 3.3 Buttigieg 2.9 3.2 Sanders 3.1 3.1 Biden 2.7 3.1 Klobuchar 2.7 2.9 Booker 2.6 2.9 Harris 2.7 2.9 Yang 2.8 2.7 O \u2019 Rourke 2.5 2.7 Steyer 2.4 2.6 Castro 2.5 2.6 Gabbard 2.4 2.3 From a survey of 3,360 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14 . The same people were surveyed again from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16 ; 712 responded to the second wave and said that they watched the debate . Source : Ipsos/\u2588\u2588\u2588\nWe also wanted to see how viewers \u2019 opinions of the candidates changed as a result of the debate . So , to see who made a positive ( or negative ) impression , we calculated the candidates \u2019 net favorability ( favorable rating minus unfavorable rating ) before and after the debate .\nAlthough both Buttigieg and Klobuchar were on the attack , their net favorability increased by 2.6 points and 3.2 points , respectively . That said , even with her modest bump , Klobuchar is still not viewed as favorably as candidates like Buttigieg , Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris . And not every candidate made a positive impression : former Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke lost the gains he made in the last debate and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard \u2019 s return to the stage did not impress viewers either .\nMore people like Klobuchar ; O \u2019 Rourke took a hit Change in net favorability for candidates in a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll taken before and after the fourth Democratic primary debate Net favorability candidate before debate after debate change Klobuchar +11.8 +15.0 +3.2 Buttigieg +30.9 +33.5 +2.6 Warren +52.1 +54.3 +2.2 Sanders +43.1 +45.2 +2.1 Biden +47.4 +48.6 +1.2 Steyer +0.8 +2.0 +1.2 Yang +14.2 +14.5 +0.3 Booker +26.3 +25.3 -1.0 Harris +30.8 +28.4 -2.4 Castro +11.6 +8.2 -3.3 Gabbard -2.3 -6.8 -4.5 O \u2019 Rourke +22.6 +16.9 -5.7 From a survey of 3,360 likely Democratic primary voters who were surveyed between Oct. 7 and Oct. 14 . The same people were surveyed again from Oct. 15 to Oct. 16 ; 1,761 responded to the second wave .\nWarren got her first taste of being the race \u2019 s front-runner , and spent much of the debate deflecting other candidates \u2019 attacks . She spoke almost 3,700 words \u2014 more than any other candidate and 600 words more than the second-most-prolific talker , Biden . This is a notable change from the September debate , when Warren was third in words spoken behind both Biden and Booker . Impressively , O \u2019 Rourke and Klobuchar \u2014 who were both near the bottom for words spoken in the last debate \u2014 clocked in at third and fourth in words spoken , respectively .
