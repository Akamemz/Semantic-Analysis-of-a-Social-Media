    "content": "Libertarian Party presidential nominees Gary Johnson and William Weld took out a full-page ad in today 's New York Times , addressing an open letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates ( CPD ) , the bipartisan if technically nonpartisan outfit that is scheduled to announce the Sept. 26 debate participants as soon as tomorrow ( though likely a few days after ) .
