    "content": "These are just a sampling of the most stinging descriptions of Bernie Sanders embedded in the Hillary Clinton campaign \u2019 s internal opposition research files from during their bitter primary fight , which were published this week by WikiLeaks . The documents are part of a trove of emails stolen from campaign chairman John Podesta \u2019 s account , part of a broader effort that U.S. officials have said is a Russian operation designed to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election .\nWhile such research is a routine part of campaigning \u2014 and the Clinton team did not end up publicly using the overwhelming majority of the information \u2014 the documents \u2019 publication is still likely to cause Democrats \u2019 political heartburn at a time when Donald Trump is desperate to drive a wedge between the Vermont senator \u2019 s fans and the nominee .\nIn an email dated November 5 , 2015 , Clinton \u2019 s research director Tony Carrk circulated six exhaustive documents compiled by his staff , detailing Sanders \u2019 record and past , to two dozen other Clinton advisers as they girded for a longer-than-expected primary that ultimately stretched seven more months . It is not clear what pieces of the extensive research were intended for eventual public use or even represented the campaign \u2019 s views ; such in-depth documents typically include a wide range of potential hits and pieces of information that are never used or even considered .\nBut the timing of the documents \u2019 circulation to a group that included some of the campaign \u2019 s top aides \u2014 like Podesta , policy advisors Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris , communications director Jennifer Palmieri , chief strategist Joel Benenson , media advisors Jim Margolis and Mandy Grunwald , and debate coaches Ron Klain and Karen Dunn \u2014 is also telling .\nThe wording of Carrk \u2019 s email suggests the November exchange is one of the first times the research had been discussed internally . By that point , Sanders was already threatening Clinton \u2019 s lead in a number of states , and he had overtaken her in polls of New Hampshire , so the delayed conversation reinforces the public perception at the time that the senator \u2019 s candidacy had caught the former secretary of state 's team off-guard .\nSanders \u2019 spokesman did not offer a specific response to the opposition research files , instead pointing to a previous statement made by the Vermont senator declaring that , `` the job of the progressive movement now is to look forward , not backward . No matter what Secretary Clinton may have said years ago behind closed doors , what 's important today is that millions of people stand up and demand that the Democratic Party implement the most progressive platform in the history of our country . ''\nIndeed , even amid the publication of other emails deeply critical of the would-be revolutionary , Sanders has been an energetic campaigner for Clinton , crisscrossing the country to convince his supporters that she is the obvious choice over Trump \u2014 regardless of the bitter words spilled in public or in private emails during a tense primary season .\nStill , the emails have left some liberals concerned about the likely work of a Clinton White House , given her staff 's critical internal conversations about Sanders during their long primary fight and the long discussions over how Clinton should position herself on issues important to progressives , such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal .\nAnd the files do appear to reveal the origin of some of Clinton \u2019 s most frequently used barbs against Sanders : The top issue raised in a document titled \u201c Sanders Thematics \u201d is \u201c Sanders Is Wrong on Guns \u201d \u2014 one of the main cases that Clinton and allies pressed against him in the primary . The files also include details on Sanders \u2019 history of avoiding identification with the Democratic Party , his vote for the 1994 crime bill , and his opposition to the Export-Import Bank , which also became major issues . And the hits on Sanders \u2019 scant record of accomplishment in Congress strongly foreshadowed Clinton \u2019 s campaign-trail refrain that she is \u201c a progressive who gets things done . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s campaign , meanwhile , has refused to authenticate the emails or comment on their contents , instead pointing out their provenance : a Russian hack likely designed to swing the election to Trump .\n`` Given a third opportunity on the debate stage to admit and condemn the Kremlin 's actions , Donald Trump refused to do it and instead chose to continue coddling Putin despite being briefed by U.S. intelligence , \u201d Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin said when asked about the Sanders files . `` It is bizarre and disqualifying that he continues to cheer on this attack on our democracy . ''\nNonetheless , all told , the six documents included in Carrk \u2019 s email total a staggering 1,020 pages , and run the gamut from a basic biography of Sanders to a year-by-year analysis of his activity during his 16 years in the House of Representatives . The vast majority of the information contained in the files is not harmful to Sanders , but rather a detailed rundown of his past . At points , however , the analysis is sharply worded .\nThe 108-page \u201c Sanders Top Hits - Thematics \u201d document lays out potential lines of attack , many of which popped up during the primary , like his history on guns and \u201c Sanders \u2019 Record at Odds with Key Democratic Constiuen [ c ] ies. \u201d It digs into his record on LGBT rights as the mayor of Burlington , Vermont , and includes a 2-page sub-section titled \u201c Using His Position to Benefit Family , \u201d detailing campaign work done by his wife , son and stepdaughter . And it anticipates more of the fights that would end up animating the primary , with detailed summaries of Sanders \u2019 votes and past statements about the Commodities Futures Modernization Act and the 1994 crime bill .\n\u201c Sanders campaign planned to highlight Hillary Clinton \u2019 s statements in favor of the 1994 crime bill\u2026but Sanders voted for the 1994 crime bill\u2026and spoke out in favor of the bill\u2026and criticized those who opposed it\u2026and touted it on his 2006 Senate election website\u2026the Sanders campaign also highlighted the crime bill to prove he had a strong record fighting crime against women , \u201d reads a collection of sub-section titles .\nThat file also includes a three-page section titled , \u201c Sanders Past Extreme Positions , \u201d starting with , \u201c Sanders supported a 100 percent tax rate for income above $ 1 million \u201d and finishing with \u201c Legalizing All Drugs . ''\nAnother document , \u201c Conflicts and Questionable , \u201d ranges over 630 pages to list an enormous compendium of Sanders \u2019 past statements on policy , noting potential , though often tenuous , examples of his supposed hypocrisy on issues from marijuana decriminalization to super PACs to specific tax credits .\nCarrk \u2019 s team also put together an exhaustive analysis of Sanders \u2019 lengthy voting record , with a particular emphasis on his potential vulnerabilities \u2014 albeit many of them tendentious or cherry-picked examples of politically questionable votes he \u2019 d taken over his years in the House and Senate .\nThe documents previewed several Sanders weaknesses the Clinton campaign would go on to exploit during the primary , particularly his record on gun safety . But the files overall also lay out background information on areas both significant and minute that her advisers ultimately concluded were not worth pursuing , such as his refusal \u201c to take a stand on terrorism in Israel \u201d or his alleged siding \u201c with corporate interests over citizens \u2019 privacy. \u201d One potential hit noted his practice of not paying some campaign employees the $ 15 minimum wage he promoted . Another discussed his wife Jane \u2019 s rocky tenure running a college in Burlington . The researchers even flagged his 1993 purchase of an \u201c eco-socialist magazine subscription \u201d with $ 20 worth of taxpayer funds .\nIn many cases , the documents \u2019 narratives differ sharply from the glowing words Clinton and Sanders now have for each other on the campaign trail . The nominee now regularly invokes Sanders ' name as a way to energize millennial voters who were skeptical of her candidacy \u2014 particularly in battleground states where he defeated her in the primary or where their contest was close , such as Colorado , New Hampshire , Michigan , and Iowa .\nIn one particularly harsh section of the document titled `` Issues , '' the research portrays Sanders as soft on protecting children , noting that he had \u201c twice voted against establishing the AMBER Alert system to help find kidnapped children and impose tougher penalties on child abusers , kidnappers and child pornographers . \u201d\nIt added : \u201c He also opposed a measure that would allow parents to access information through a national hotline to determine in an individual was a registered sex offender . \u201d\nPerhaps the harshest potential knocks against Sanders , however , came in a section branding him a lousy manager who failed to make much of a mark in his 25 years on Capitol Hill .\nTitled \u201c Can \u2019 t Work With People To Get Things Done , \u201d the section in the \u201c Sanders Top Hits - Thematics \u201d document has sub-sections including , \u201c No Accomplishments , \u201d \u201c Sanders Does Not Work Well With Other Lawmakers , \u201d \u201c Not A Good Boss , \u201d and \u201c Abrasive Leadership in Vermont .
