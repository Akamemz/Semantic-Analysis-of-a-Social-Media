' \u2014 VA Secretary Robert Wilkie , on doctor payments\nFrom his office perch two blocks from the White House , Wilkie surveyed the task ahead and homed in on the popular private-doctor program used by millions of veterans . He told Fox News he has promised the president he will address one glaring problem in particular : doctors getting stiffed by the VA .\n\u201c The Veterans Affairs Department in the last eight to nine years has not been paying those bills to small-town doctors , to community hospital emergency care facilities , \u201d he said .\nAt issue is a program that was revamped under this administration .\nIn June , Trump signed a bill to replace the troubled Veterans Choice Program , enacted in 2014 under then-President Barack Obama , to expand access for veterans wishing to see private doctors and other providers to ease the burden on families forced to drive long distances for VA care .\n\u201c It makes no sense to me that we require someone to travel -- let 's use a state like Montana -- where the distances are enormous , 600 or 700 miles round trip , \u201d said Wilkie . \u201c They pass a lot of doctors along the way . We need to bring those doctors into the Veterans Affairs system . \u201d\nWilkie said , though , if they can \u2019 t fix the doctor payment issue and \u201c if we don \u2019 t get a hold of what we owe Americans who are providing services to our veterans , then the entire system collapses . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s just the start to his challenges at the sprawling department .\nThe VA has suffered from a series of high-profile scandals in recent years involving secret wait-lists , systemic neglect and even veterans dying while waiting to see a doctor . Wilkie is the fourth secretary to lead the VA in the past four years .\nThe VA \u2019 s $ 200 billion budget has doubled in the past decade . The new secretary said of the 370,000 employees under that network , \u201c there are probably 100 bad eggs \u201d in the system still .\nOne of the first things Wilkie vowed to turn around , though , is a perceived morale problem at the agency that \u2019 s supposed to serve 9 million veterans .\n`` This is an institution that has been buffeted by continuous body blows for a number of years , '' Wilkie admitted .\nTo tackle the problem , Wilkie plans to be more visible not only at headquarters in Washington but VA hospitals throughout the country .
