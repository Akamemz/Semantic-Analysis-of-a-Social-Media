We are continuing to work closely and cooperate with him . We look forward to seeing this hoax wrap up very soon . ''\nNow an investigation that has led to an indictment of Trump \u2019 s former campaign manager and a guilty plea from his former national security adviser is not exactly a hoax . But Sanders was unambiguous on the firing question .\nStill , the pundits keep pounding away . On MSNBC \u2019 s `` Morning Joe '' yesterday , John Heilemann told Republican Sen. Bob Corker : `` I want to ask you personally what your reaction would be if the president did try to fire the special prosecutor . ''\nCorker said `` there would be an uprising and a revolt . ''\nIn fairness , Heilemann was reacting in part to a Senate floor speech by Democrat Mark Warner , who declared that any attempt by Trump to dump Mueller or shut down the Russia probe `` would be a gross abuse of power '' and that these were `` red lines '' that could not be crossed .\nWas Warner just taking a partisan shot ? He gave no indication that he believes such a move is in the works .\nNow no one can say it 's impossible that Trump wo n't change his mind and try to get rid of Mueller . The prosecutor could bring new charges or make sweeping demands for evidence that would anger the president and prod him into action .\nBut the administration is n't sending such signals . In fact , the firing would have to be carried out by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who recently testified that he thinks Mueller is doing a good job and could only be removed for valid reasons .\nSo at the moment , all this amounts to an orgy of speculation .\nThe Washington Post , jumping on Warner \u2019 s remarks , ran a story yesterday titled `` The Growing Specter of Robert Mueller \u2019 s Firing . '' The article declares that \u201c the environment for attempting to fire Mueller is clearly improving . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s a Bloomberg piece titled `` What Might Happen If Trump Orders Mueller Fired . ''\nThe media mindset was perfect captured by a Chicago Tribune column with the headline : `` Trump Says He Won \u2019 t Fire Bob Mueller . Don \u2019 t Believe Him . ''\nWhy not ? Eric Zorn wrote that `` the big reason is that I simply do n't believe it , just as I did n't believe Trump \u2019 s assurance that he had a plan to provide 'great health care , at a tiny fraction of the cost . ' I didn \u2019 t believe him when he said super-wealthy people would n't benefit from a Republican tax overhaul , that it would personally cost him a fortune and that someday he 'd release his tax returns . ''\nIn other words , he does n't trust the guy and disagrees with his policies .\nThe media will have every right to go bonkers if Trump tries to oust the prosecutor investigating him . But for now , it may be the most overcovered hypothetical question in politics .",
