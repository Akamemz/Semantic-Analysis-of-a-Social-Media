    "title": "Is Jeb Bush actually a moderate, or does the media just think he is?",

    "content": "In an excellent profile in the Weekly Standard , Andrew Ferguson reviews Jeb Bush 's record in Florida and concludes that overall , he 's much more conservative than both the national press corps and right-leaning activists think . He posits at the end that Jeb could be `` a self-conscious , deep-dyed conservative who for the moment feels the need to look like a moderate , especially before an admiring press and in the company of the wealthy Republicans who these days are his constant companions and marks . ''\nI 've been exploring similar territory for a forthcoming piece on Bush 's political history , and there 's definitely a lot of truth to this analysis . What I 'd add here , though , is that Bush 's position on immigration reform ( which Ferguson does n't really get into ) does n't quite fit into this framework . To see why , check out this video from Bush 's Right to Rise PAC , titled `` Conservative '' and presenting highlights from Bush 's speech at CPAC :\nAfter a litany of standard conservative views , there 's the twist : `` There is no plan to deport 11 million people , '' the video shows Bush saying . `` We should give them a path to legal status where they work , where they do n't receive government benefits , where they do n't break the law , where they learn English , and where they make a contribution to our society . ''\nThe point ? Other likely 2016 Republican candidates are contorting themselves on immigration . Recently , Scott Walker stressed his opposition to `` amnesty '' in public , while privately telling elites that he 'd support , at least , a path to legal status . Dara Lind has a good rundown of the controversy here . But Bush is taking the opposite approach , not only playing up his support of legal status in both public and private , but also arguing that it is the true conservative position .\nSo here , Bush 's position-taking is n't just rhetorical . It 's a genuine attempt to shift his party and its base from their current default view , which is opposition to immigration reform that legalizes the status of unauthorized immigrants .\nThe upshot is that by challenging his party on one high-profile issue , Bush has to do less to seem moderate elsewhere , in the eyes of both the press and activists , when the general election rolls around . And somewhat fairly so ! With the parties as polarized as they are , it is genuinely unusual for a candidate to forthrightly take on the base .\nBut as both liberals and conservatives agree , Bush 's overall governing record has very little that 's moderate about it . So in an interesting sense , Bush 's immigration position lets him have things both ways \u2014 it gives the media a peg to hang the moderate label on Bush , but as the right learns more about his record , it lets him tout that he is , otherwise , a down-the-line conservative .",
