Or rather \u201c Jeb ! \u201d as his campaign has dubbed him , hoping to add a little excitement to the mix ( and possibly to underplay his famous last name . )\nBut after one year of failing to rev up voter enthusiasm , is it time for Jeb to pack up his attack ads and go home ?\nNot only are his poll numbers far from where his supporters thought they would be by now , Jeb is also acting as spoiler , destroying the candidate most likely to beat Hillary Clinton . In doing so , it appears his nasty campaign against Marco Rubio has wrecked his own chances . In clobbering his popular rival and one-time mentee , Bush has shown himself either incapable of bucking the operatives running his Super PAC , or full of baloney .\nAfter eight years of Barack Obama , the last thing this country needs is another weak-kneed leader . Or a hypocrite .\nFor months , Jeb Bush publicly agonized over whether he should run for president . Bush worried that he would be forced into the political gutter , claiming that he would only run if his campaign could focus \u201c on the issues. \u201d He was eager to lay out his prescriptions for solving the country \u2019 s ills , to push education and tax reform , for instance , but not keen to engage in a cage match with the other contestants . He wanted to run \u201c joyfully \u201d because he thought the country needed a candidate who would \u201c lift the country \u2019 s spirits . \u201d\nThe head of Bush \u2019 s Super PAC apparently sees the campaign differently . Since Right to Rise ( R2R ) has raised ten times the money brought in by the campaign , it \u2019 s easy to imagine who \u2019 s calling the shots . Mike Murphy , according to some , is on a personal vendetta against Marco Rubio , whom Bush loyalists consider disloyal for having entered the race . As a result , R2R has spent an astonishing $ 20 million on ads attacking the Florida Senator \u2013 about one third of the Super PAC \u2019 s ad spending to date , and more than the group has spent undermining any other candidate .\nSome of the ads target Rubio \u2019 s attendance record in the Senate , and his numerous missed votes . Some paint him a flip-flopper , changing positions with the shifting political winds . And then there was a cheesy ad mocking Rubio \u2019 s boots , of all things , which surely was another rung down into the gutter . ( In fairness , the New York Times ran no less than four pieces on Rubio \u2019 s boots . )\nThat poke was , as Rob Garver described it in The Fiscal Times , supposed to be funny but instead came across as \u201c awkward and uncomfortable , like a Dad joke told in a car full of teenagers . \u201d\nHas the assault on Rubio helped Bush ? Certainly not in Iowa , where R2R has spent $ 8.5 million blasting Rubio . In that state , Bush is languishing in fifth place with only 3 percent of the vote , compared to 14 percent going to Rubio and 37 percent to Trump . In more moderate New Hampshire , a state where the Bush-Rubio rivalry is critical to both campaigns , the Bush Super PAC has spent $ 7.5 million attacking Rubio .\nThe gap between Bush and Rubio has narrowed , but most polls show Marco leading by a few points .
