One group sees an unarmed father being shot by the side of the road ; the other sees a man , possibly high on drugs , refusing to obey police commands .\nIt \u2019 s also to the point that while the police say Keith Scott brandished a gun when police approached his parked car near an apartment complex in his hometown of Charlotte , his family insist that he was holding a book before he was shot and killed .\n\u201c Personally , I try to be very objective , \u201d says Mr. Terrell , the director of development and co-CEO of Profound Gentlemen , a community advocacy group that seeks to support male teachers of color become mentors for young students . \u201c I can see the gray areas in a lot of these cases , I \u2019 m able to see some justice in some of the police accounts and police testimony , ... but it seems so clear that there \u2019 s just no justification for this kind of use of force being used against these guys . \u201d\nIn Tulsa on Thursday , Officer Betty Shelby was charged with manslaughter in the death of Mr. Crutcher . In Charlotte , where the governor declared a state of emergency after violent protests that left one man critically wounded , Chief Kerr Putney of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said that his department would not release the police recordings of Mr. Scott \u2019 s shooting .\n\u201c The video does not give me absolute , definitive , visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun , \u201d the chief said at a news conference .\nBut he says the videos , which will be shown to the family , did corroborate the official version of the encounter , buttressing witness accounts and other evidence .\nOn the one hand , the breakdown in trust between black communities and the criminal justice system has a long history , many community members say \u2013 and not simply going back to the many instances of killings that include Eric Garner , Michael Brown , Tamir Rice , Walter Scott , Freddie Gray , Philando Castile , and numerous others , which together helped launch and galvanize the Black Lives Matter movement .\nYet the breakdown of trust has also become a broader phenomenon the past few years , many scholars note .\n\u201c I would argue that trust is foundational for all our social interactions , \u201d says Brad Reid , senior scholar at the Dean Institute for Corporate Governance and Integrity at Lipscomb University in Nashville , Tenn. \u201c And I would further argue that it 's hard to create or sustain a broader society if you can \u2019 t trust other people or institutions . \u201d\nSince 2007 , the Great Recession has prompted many to distrust the nation \u2019 s financial systems . Hyper-partisanship and congressional gridlock , as well as the feeling among Democrats and Republicans alike that the nation \u2019 s political institutions are \u201c rigged , \u201d have spurred voter unrest . And the current presidential candidates , Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , are the least trusted in recent memory , according to polls .\nAdd to this , too , that more than 2 out of 3 Americans now say that the mass media fails \u201c to report the news fully , accurately and fairly , \u201d according to a Gallup poll this month \u2013 which notes this is the lowest level of trust in Gallup polling history .\nThe result is a \u201c corrosive cynicism \u201d that has begun to spread throughout the American social matrix , Professor Reid says . And while its causes are complex and in many ways far from unprecedented , a lot has to do with the ways in which Americans consume and digest information within the tumultuous era of digital information .\nCertain groups filter , almost unconsciously , the information they see \u201c so that every event is a piece in that puzzle of their world view , everything is filtered through the lenses of that worldview , \u201d says Reid . \u201c And then groups tend to talk past each other . When they have radically different perceptions of what \u2019 s going on in their world , just even framing a common agenda is difficult . \u201d\nFor Terrell , the dispute over the facts surrounding Scott \u2019 s shooting belie a larger issue , however .\n\u201c Even regardless if he had a gun or a book , North Carolina is an open carry state , \u201d says Terrell , who has a license to carry a firearm . \u201c So constitutionally , he should have been allowed to have a gun on his person . And he wasn \u2019 t being targeted by police there wasn \u2019 t a warrant out for his arrest . \u201d\nDespite having no motives to resist , officers perceived these men \u2019 s actions as threats to their lives and killed them .\nTerrell admits that he worries sometimes about his own safety .\n\u201c It is a concern . It \u2019 s something I think about . I got into it with my father , we go out to shoot sometimes at the range . It \u2019 s a sport , something I like to do , something I want to learn more about doing , and it \u2019 s also my constitutional right , \u201d he says . \u201c But I \u2019 m fearful of that , because carrying a gun sometimes could be perceived to be negative \u2013 I don \u2019 t know , because of the environment I \u2019 m in , or because of my skin tone , or what have you . So I \u2019 m not always able to really feel good about that right to carry a gun . \u201d\nIt is such dramatically varying perceptions , both on the ground and in the ways people interpret the videos of these encounters , that are rooted in a profound lack of trust .\n\u201c Lack of trust goes both ways , \u201d says Bruce Schneier , a digital security expert who explored the concept of social trust in his book , \u201c Liars & Outliers : Enabling the Trust That Society Needs To Thrive. \u201d \u201c The reason these escalate into violence is because the police do not trust the people they \u2019 re stopping . There , I think their trust is misguided . It could be based on racism . \u201d\nPolice reject this claim . \u201c She \u2019 s afraid he could have gun in his pocket . He \u2019 s got very loose clothing on , \u201d said Scott Wood , the attorney representing Officer Shelby . \u201c So she draws her gun on him and says , \u2018 Sir I want you to get down on your knees , get down on your knees . ' He refuses that command . \u201d\nFor many observers , such encounters have been happening for decades , if not longer . \u201c It \u2019 s not that the police are more violent or more racist than in the past , it \u2019 s just that there are more cameras now , that \u2019 s the difference , \u201d says Mr. Schneier .\nScholars point out that the lack of trust many Americans now feel go back to the 1960s and 1970s , another time of social upheaval and unrest , when the civil rights movement , Vietnam , and Watergate helped spur protest movements and widespread cynicism over social institutions .\n\u201c And it \u2019 s not so much that people were more trustworthy in the past and are less so now , \u201d says Aram Sinnreich , professor of communication at American University in Washington , D.C. \u201c It \u2019 s more that we had fewer sources in the past , and fewer methods of verifying information in the past . \u201d\n\u201c And today , the changes in our trust of institutions have as much to do with the rise of social media and ubiquitous cell phone and camera technology as it does with the kind of revelations that came from whistle blowers like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning . \u201d\nThe digital age has also had the paradoxical effect of drowning citizens in information , he says . \u201c The challenge now is for us collectively to make sense of all that information and to figure out which sources are trustworthy and which are not .
