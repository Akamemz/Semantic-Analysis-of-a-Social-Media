    "content": "The Justice Department has given Hillary Clinton a clean legal bill of health in the long-running saga over her private email server while she was secretary of state , but few Democrats think the news will help her campaign .\nThat \u2019 s according to the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus \u2014 a panel of activists , strategists and operatives in 10 key battleground states . Just under a quarter ( 24 percent ) of Democrats said FBI Director James Comey \u2019 s statements this week would help Clinton \u2019 s campaign because she avoided criminal charges .\nSlightly more Democratic insiders ( 26 percent ) said Comey \u2019 s stern rebuke \u2014 in which he called Clinton \u201c extremely careless \u201d for using a non-secure platform for her email , which included some classified material \u2014 would hurt Clinton \u2019 s campaign . Half of Democratic insiders said it would have no impact .\nRepublicans were far more likely to see Comey \u2019 s statement as bad news for the Clinton campaign . About two-thirds ( 66 percent ) said it would hurt Clinton \u2019 s campaign , compared to 16 percent who thought it would help , and 18 percent who said it would have no impact .\nA number of Democrats said the results of the investigation \u2014 disclosed by the FBI in a rare public statement Tuesday \u2014 reinforces voters \u2019 feelings that she isn \u2019 t honest and trustworthy . Just 30 percent of registered voters in a Fox News poll last week said the words \u201c honest and trustworthy \u201d describe Clinton , compared to the nearly two-thirds who said they didn \u2019 t describe her .\n\u201c This is not a win . Comey eviscerated all the excuses for Hillary and her team \u2019 s behaviors . It plays into the narrative that she can \u2019 t be trusted , \u201d said an Iowa Democrat , who , like all respondents , completed the survey anonymously . \u201c If she was running against anyone other than Trump , this would have been blown up much bigger and hit much harder . \u201d\nThe survey was conducted after Comey presented the findings of his investigation and the bureau \u2019 s recommendation that prosecutors not pursue charges against Clinton . Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u2019 s announcement that the Justice Department wouldn \u2019 t charge Clinton , along with Comey \u2019 s testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , came while the survey was in the field .\n\u201c Every adjective [ Comey ] used confirms the worst suspicions of those who were a wee bit squeamish about voting for her , \u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat . \u201c I cant think of a way it could have been worse , short of an actual recommendation to indict . In fact , because the case appeared to be laid out for prosecution of some nature , the fact that this wasn \u2019 t recommended only seems to reinforce Trump \u2019 s charge of a \u2018 rigged system . \u2019 \u201d\nSome Democrats said Comey \u2019 s statement will hurt Clinton \u2014 but also expressed relief that Trump had botched his initial response .\n\u201c This story will continue to play into the Hillary trust issue , \u201d said a Colorado Democrat . \u201c The only upside is that just about anything Trump says right now is exponentially worse . His latest anti-Semitic dustup , alongside his praise of Saddam Hussein , are just the latest in a litany of poor choices . \u201d\n\u201c She is lucky not to be indicted , but Comey \u2019 s comments were brutal , \u201d added another Colorado Democrat . \u201c Luckily , Trump is so undisciplined that he missed his best chances to hammer her . \u201d\nOther Democrats said voters \u2019 perceptions of the Clinton email case were mostly formed before Comey \u2019 s statements , and the mixed verdict \u2014 with investigators judging her behavior careless but not criminal \u2014 was unlikely to change many minds .\n\u201c The whole thing is baked in at this point .

Ask Scooter Libby if it is better to be sternly rebuked rather than indicted . \u201d\nAnd still other Republicans lamented the Trump campaign \u2019 s inability to capitalize on the Comey report .\n\u201c It will have no impact because my party is apparently committed to nominating Donald Trump and flying the plane directly into the mountain , \u201d said a Virginia Republican .\n\u201c In any other campaign , the FBI director 's report would have disqualified Hillary Clinton for the awesome responsibility of the presidency , \u201d added a New Hampshire Republican . \u201c But Donald Trump is so flawed and complete unable to prosecute the former secretary of state \u2019 s scandals that Hillary will be beat him anyway . Sad ! \u201d\nRepublicans to Trump : Don \u2019 t pick a general for vice president .\nDonald Trump should pick a running mate with political experience \u2014 and forget the notion of choosing a general or a fellow industrialist to join his ticket .\nThe vast majority of Republican insiders , 83 percent , said someone with experience in government , whether as an executive or a legislator , would be most helpful to Trump \u2019 s campaign .\n\u201c He needs someone with a calming influence who can help him on Capitol Hill and with key constituent groups that want to vote for Trump but remain reluctant , \u201d said an Ohio Republican \u2014 who , like all respondents , completed the survey anonymously .\n\u201c He needs someone to help him with Congress , \u201d an Iowa Republican said . \u201c He 'll have to learn that he ca n't just stomp his feet and get his way \u2014 like Obama had to learn . \u201d\nA Nevada Republican added that a Trump running mate \u201c with political experience will be very helpful ; however , it can \u2019 t be a well-known establishment operative : It needs to be someone with a track record of producing conservative results . \u201d\nA few GOP insiders offered former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is apparently in the running , as someone who would offer Trump that experience .\n\u201c Newt would be a great addition to the team , \u201d offered an Iowa Republican , who said Gingrich would \u201c bring home conservatives \u201d and \u201c be the smartest person in the race . \u201d\nTrump \u201c could use a heavy dose of ideas and governing vision , \u201d added a Colorado Republican . \u201c At this point , I honestly like the idea of Newt a lot .
