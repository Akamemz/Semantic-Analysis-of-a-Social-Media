    "content": "As of Saturday afternoon , more than 35 inches of rain had fallen in Surf City on the North Carolina coast . That \u2019 s an enormous amount of water to fall in two days . And the flooding isn \u2019 t over .\nFlorence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday morning near Wilmington as a hurricane , and then slowed down to a sluggish 2 miles per hour . It essentially stalled over the Carolinas , bringing incredible amounts of rain to the region .\nEven though it was downgraded to a tropical storm and , now , a tropical depression , the danger it poses in terms of flooding is far from over , as floodwaters continue to fill rivers inland . \u201c As the moisture with Florence moves into the Appalachians , expect more flash flooding and possible landslides , \u201d the National Weather Service warned Saturday afternoon .\nLocal authorities have reported at least 14 deaths related from the storm so far . And though the rain is slowly making its way out of the region , conditions on the ground still continue to be dangerous in many places .\nThe flooding WILL GET WORSE in many locations across SC , NC and VA. River levels will continue to rise today and early this week . If you live near a body of water , do n't let your guard down and follow local evacuation orders ! https : //t.co/nHwnCyIDa8 pic.twitter.com/oNwHdcQtE4 \u2014 NWS ( @ NWS ) September 16 , 2018\nThe NWS is called the flooding \u201c catastrophic. \u201d In all , forecasters estimate that 18 trillion gallons of water may drop on the region . Here \u2019 s what we know about the flooding still to come and why this is shaping up to be a very costly natural disaster .\nAs the storm crept from North Carolina to South Carolina , it dumped a truly enormous amount of rain , breaking records . Swansboro North Carolina saw more than 30 inches . That \u2019 s a record amount , 6 inches greater than the city saw with Hurricane Floyd in 1999 .\nThese numbers make Florence comparable to last year \u2019 s Hurricane Harvey , which stalled over the Houston area and broke the national rainfall record for a single tropical storm . It dumped around 27 trillion gallons of water in total and destroyed around 30,000 homes .\n40-50 '' rainfall totals beginning to show up in higher-res guidance as the event begins to unfold . Reminds me of how guidance began to respond in Harvey .

And it \u2019 s not just happening on the coasts . As the storm progresses and the heavy rain continues to fall , rivers and creeks further inland will start to overflow as well . Not helping : The fact that the ground in the Carolinas is already saturated from a storm-filled summer . That will lead to more surface runoff inland .\nFor instance , the Cape Fear River in Fayetteville , North Carolina , is about 100 miles from the coast . It \u2019 s expected to flood more than 27 feet above its banks .\n\u201c Life-threatening , catastrophic flash floods and prolonged significant river flooding are likely over portions of the Carolinas and the southern to central Appalachians from western North Carolina into west-central Virginia and far eastern West Virginia through early next week , \u201d the weather service warned Saturday , adding that landslides are possible in the mountains .\nThis flooding also poses an environmental risk . According to the Associated Press , 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash \u2014 a byproduct of coal power production \u2014 were washed away from a landfill near Wilmington , North Carolina . Coal ash includes toxic substances like mercury and arsenic , which can now flow into rivers , lakes , and the ocean .\nThe last 2 high tides in Wilmington , NC have been in the top 10 highest water levels on record at our tide gauge .
