A viewer 's guide to Clinton Fever\nThe obsessive speculation about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s plans for 2016 promises to be the longest and most intense parlor game in the history of American politics . It is a consuming fixation already , not just among the operatives and reporters who always inhale this stuff but to an extraordinary degree among average Americans .\nThe official Clinton line \u2014 she hasn \u2019 t decided and won \u2019 t for perhaps two years to come \u2014 has done nothing to quiet the national argument . She \u2019 s too tired , and , in her mid-60s , just wants to enjoy life , says one line . Nonsense , says the other : Why would anyone , especially someone as ambitious as she is , decline a historic presidential nomination that many believe is hers for the asking .\nOf all the possible 2016 candidates , Clinton can most afford to take her time deciding . But there are a number of different choices \u2014 about her financial future , about her public profile , about whom she surrounds herself with \u2014 that will make clear whether Clinton is organizing her life in anticipation of a second presidential run or has decided to liberate herself from ambition and just do what she wants .\nHere is a checklist of things to watch about Clinton \u2019 s future \u2014 a kind of viewer \u2019 s guide to Hillary Fever :\nIn many ways , Clinton \u2019 s path will be revealed as much by the choices she does not make as the ones she does .\nHow she chooses to make money over the next two years could be particularly telling . She could easily follow her husband or , more dramatically , Al Gore in amassing a fortune that would be worth tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars ( and do recall she has already spent a fair amount of her own money to retire her 2008 campaign debt ) .\nThe problem is that many of the most obvious ways to do this would not necessarily be helpful to an aspiring presidential candidate . It could involve speaking fees to groups that she would just as soon not be associated with , or serving as an adviser or director of corporate interests that are lightning rods for one part or another of the Democratic coalition .\nIf she were to join , say , the board of Walmart , it would be a deal-breaker in a Democratic presidential primary .\nThe same holds true for her public speeches : Which ones she gives , and where , and who pays for them will be scrutinized closely ( Speeches paid for by hedge funds , for instance , might be radioactive for the Democratic base . )\nFor that matter , any new property she and her husband buy will be factored into the equation \u2014 a report that they were looking at a home in the rich Long Island enclave the Hamptons was denied by her aides and would have been an odd choice in the post-Mitt Romney presidential cycle .\nClinton will lead a very affluent lifestyle under any scenario . But a future campaign is constraining by nature , and the choices Clinton makes about her earnings will reveal the extent to which she is preserving her options .\nIf there has been a flare pointing to a likely Clinton campaign , it was the nearly six-minute video she released explaining her shift in favor of gay marriage last month .\nIt allowed Clinton to make a necessary policy shift . But it came at virtually the last minute possible before the U.S. Supreme Court took up arguments in two gay marriage-related cases .\nCaution has been a hallmark of Clinton \u2019 s candidacies \u2014 going for the bold statement has not been . That \u2019 s unlikely to change now , especially as she is poised to continue using her own videos to circumvent the press and the unruliness of interviews .\nAnd it \u2019 s hard to see her engaging in dangerous forms of politicking \u2013 she will likely back nominees but not get involved in primaries , and she will want to pick and choose so as not to expend too much political capital too early .\nThere are policy issues that relate to her time at the State Department where she could weigh in \u2013 Syria , for instance , or Iran . If she were to really say where she stands , based on her past policy platforms , she would likely back aggressive intervention in Syria . Another proposal observers could see her supporting , in the debt reduction fight , is the Simpson-Bowles plan .\nBut a presidential candidate who got burned for her vote a decade ago on the Iraq war \u2014 and who stumbled in a debate on a question about drivers \u2019 licenses for undocumented immigrants \u2014 is unlikely to come close to stepping on these Democratic \u201c third rails . \u201d\nThe type of entity Clinton sets up for her charitable work \u2014 she is expected to focus heavily on global issues pertaining to women and girls \u2014 is worth watching . If she hires strictly policy types , that could be a sign she \u2019 s not running . If there are political hires in the mix , it would show she \u2019 s being mindful of what the future could hold .\nMore broadly , the major unanswered question about Clinton is whether she has learned the lessons of 2008 and can avoid repeating the mistakes of a fractious , factionalized campaign .\nThe 2008 campaign was a hodgepodge of longtime aides and advisers , and was widely regarded as a dysfunctional mess as it became clear Barack Obama was on the rise .
