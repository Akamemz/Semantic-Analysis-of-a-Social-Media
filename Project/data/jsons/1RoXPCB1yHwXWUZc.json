    "content": "When Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in Ferguson , Mo. , last August , his death set off riots and violence \u2014 and posed deep questions about race relations in America .

Jay Nixon , was tasked with finding some answers .\nThe commission set out to examine racial and economic gaps through the St. Louis region , and come up with policy recommendations .
