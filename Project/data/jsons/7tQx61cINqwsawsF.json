The fate of Clinton 's presumed presidential candidacy will depend on that struggle .\nIn past presidential cycles we have seen many a news conference where careers on the national stage seemed to hang in the balance . Some of these moments have led to redemption , others to utter disaster . And still others have proved inconclusive , with other factors determining the candidate 's fate .\nNo . 1 in the redemption category has to be Richard Nixon 's iconic `` Checkers '' speech in 1952 , when stories about gifts received by his family threatened to push him off the Republican presidential ticket as Dwight Eisenhower 's running mate .\nThe candidate spoke of his wife 's modest `` Republican cloth coat '' ( no mink or fox for Pat Nixon ) and a puppy given to his daughters , Julie and Tricia . The girls named him Checkers . `` We 're going to keep it , '' said Nixon , striking a tone of mock defiance .\nThe video of this artifact looks hopelessly crude and grainy , but this performance on TV was among the first political events of consequence carried on that fledgling medium . Eisenhower kept the young senator from California on the ticket ( partly to placate the party 's Western conservatives ) and Nixon would be in the White House for nearly 14 of the next 22 years .\nAnother vice president who saved himself in a perilous moment was Dan Quayle of Indiana , also a young senator when he was picked for the vice presidential slot by GOP nominee George H.W . Bush in 1988 . Quayle was introduced to the national media at a packed news conference in New Orleans . He bungled questions regarding his stateside service in the National Guard during the Vietnam War .\nFor the next couple of days , Quayle seemed the deer caught in the headlights , seeming woefully unequal to the task suddenly thrust upon him . But then he retreated to his home state and staged another news event . He sat at the bottom level of an outdoor amphitheater with reporters arrayed on benches above him , hurling accusatory questions . Public sympathy turned in a day , and Quayle stayed on the ticket and moved into the vice presidential residence the following winter .\nBut not all candidates have managed to save their bacon . In 1972 , Missouri Sen. Tom Eagleton was a surprise pick by Democratic nominee George McGovern , himself a senator from South Dakota . Eagleton offered neither regional nor ideological counterbalance to McGovern , but was attractive and well-spoken . Unfortunately , he had also received controversial treatments including electroshock therapy for depression .\nWhen this became public days after the nominating convention , Eagleton became the center of a media storm . Although McGovern initially said he was behind his running mate choice `` a thousand percent , '' it so happened that Eagleton had not leveled with McGovern about his medical history . Eagleton was summarily dropped from the ticket and was replaced by Sargent Shriver . The McGovern ticket lost 49 states to Nixon that November .\nThe Democrats also lost 49 states in 1984 , and that debacle featured still another troubled vice presidential choice , Geraldine Ferraro . The first woman on a major party ticket , Ferraro at the time was a congresswoman from Queens in New York City . But she was also the wife of John Zaccaro , a businessman who was initially loath to reveal his tax returns or talk about his real estate holdings or connections to local politicians . Ferraro , herself a lawyer , held a news conference that August where she confidently answered questions for two hours . That kept her on the ticket but did not dispel the air of having things to hide . Ronald Reagan got more of the women 's vote that fall than he had in 1980 .\nNews conferences are surely double-edged swords . While they have helped some candidates , they have been the undoing of others . In 1987 , two leading contenders for the following year 's Democratic presidential nomination were Gary Hart , a former senator from Colorado , and Joe Biden , a senator from Delaware . In May , the Miami Herald reported Hart had spent a weekend with a young woman at his Washington , D.C. , home while his wife was in Colorado . At a news conference a few days later , Hart was besieged by reporters who had heard other stories about his private life . One asked if Hart thought adultery was a sin . When Hart said he did , the reporter asked if Hart had committed that sin .\n`` I do n't have to answer that , '' Hart said . But in a sense , he just had . His campaign unraveled and was over the same week .\nThat summer , Biden was confronted by reports he had borrowed big chunks from a speech by a British politician whose life story Biden found inspiring .

Biden held a Capitol Hill news conference in September to confidently proclaim himself `` in the race to stay . '' But there was video of the speeches , and in dealing with a citizen question in New Hampshire , Biden misrepresented his resume and lost his temper \u2014 also on videotape . Biden suspended his campaign just days after the news conference .\nClearly , the critical factor in many of these cases has been the manner in which the media handled the story \u2014 and the manner in which the candidate handled the media .\nA major case in point , especially relevant for the current campaign , took place early in 1992 .
