One said Trump wouldn \u2019 t accept any deal that didn \u2019 t deliver the full $ 5.7 billion in funding for a border wall that he seeks . Another said he \u2019 d be willing to reduce that amount if Democrats come up with concessions of their own .\nThe diverging views echo complaints from Democrats , who have said it \u2019 s impossible to negotiate with Trump because he and his representatives are at odds and make shifting offers that are subject to change at any time . And they \u2019 re not alone in that frustration . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stayed silent for the first weeks of the shutdown after Trump suddenly reversed course in December and rejected a spending bill the Republican-led Senate had passed .\nThe first signs of movement from the Senate to reopen the government came Tuesday , when McConnell , a Kentucky Republican , and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , a New York Democrat , agreed to vote on rival proposals to end the standoff for the first time since the funding lapse began last month .\nLawmakers will hold the two separate votes on Thursday : one on Trump \u2019 s plan that includes $ 5.7 billion for border wall funding ; the other on a Democratic proposal that would reopen shuttered agencies through Feb. 8 while both sides seek consensus on how to better secure the border .\nYet Trump has threatened to veto any measure that doesn \u2019 t fully fund his wall . Democrats likely have the votes to block his bill , and the Democratic proposal would need to win support of 13 Republicans along with every Democrat just to take up that measure .\nOn Wednesday , Trump appeared to focus on the marketing of his wall for the GOP . \u201c BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL ! This is the new theme , for two years until the Wall is finished ( under construction now ) , of the Republican Party . Use it and pray ! \u201d he wrote on Twitter .\nEven as he digs in on his pro-wall rhetoric , Trump isn \u2019 t ruling out concessions on significant issues . Those potentially include permanent status for young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children , one of the people said , though that would likely carry a high price , according to a third person familiar with the president \u2019 s thinking . They requested anonymity to discuss White House internal deliberations on the shutdown strategy .\nTrump has so far been unwavering in his demand for the $ 5.7 billion and has given no public indication that he \u2019 s willing to settle for a smaller amount . And he won \u2019 t offer additional concessions until House Democrats put forward a proposal he considers a serious effort to break the impasse that has now stretched into a second month , one of the people said .\nTrump would only agree to lower his demand if Homeland Security officials who \u2019 ve been advising him on border security signed off on it , according to the person .\nThe president views the proposal he made over the weekend as an opening offer and is ready to work out a compromise if Democrats give ground , aides say . Congressional Democrats rebuffed the plan , which would have provided three years of protections for the young immigrants , known as Dreamers .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schumer have argued the president \u2019 s plan , unveiled in a weekend address , doesn \u2019 t go far enough to justify what they argue is wasteful and immoral spending on a border wall .\nTrump doesn \u2019 t feel the Democrats \u2019 current proposal to provide additional funding for border security serious enough to counter , one of the people said .\nThat \u2019 s led to frustration within the West Wing , where aides believe that Pelosi and Schumer are instructing moderate members of their party not to negotiate with the White House on a possible compromise . White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and Vice President Mike Pence have sought to court Democrats in recent days in a series of phone calls and meetings , hoping to encourage them to break from their leadership .\nWithin the White House , aides understand that the president \u2019 s proposal will struggle to get to 60 votes .
