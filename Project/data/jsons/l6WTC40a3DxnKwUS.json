Bush claims that McConnell asked him to withdraw troops from Iraq so Republicans could do better in the midterms\nBut there was a problem : The Republican Party \u2019 s image had been badly damaged by President George W. Bush and his Iraq War , and the GOP was in danger of losing its Senate majority .\nIn public , McConnell remained a loyal partisan , and publicly excoriated Democrats for wanting to \u201c retreat. \u201d In private , though , he sought a one-on-one meeting with Bush , warned him that Republicans were headed for defeat in the midterms , and urged the president to start withdrawing troops from Iraq to help the party \u2019 s chances .\nThat \u2019 s according to Bush \u2019 s own memoir , Decision Points , and the former president \u2019 s decision to include such an unflattering anecdote about his own party \u2019 s Senate leader is remarkable . \u201c I made it clear I would set troop levels to achieve victory in Iraq , not victory at the polls , \u201d Bush writes .\nMcConnell badly wanted to climb that last rung and become majority leader , and he was willing to go very far indeed to make that happen . But it didn \u2019 t happen \u2014 his party lost the Senate , and he would start his stint as top Senate Republican with only a minority to lead .\nOver the next eight years , McConnell would struggle with another Rubik \u2019 s cube of sorts : How could he best use his powers in the minority to win the majority ?\nHis twists and turns of that cube would reshape how American politics worked .\nIn 2008 , with Democrats controlling every lever of power , he quickly calculated he had little to gain from helping his opponents \u2019 agenda become law .\nThe sympathetic view of his actions is that he concluded Democrats were exploiting the crisis to ram through a liberal agenda the country didn \u2019 t support \u2014 and decided to fight back .\nA more cynical interpretation is that he realized that in a political system increasingly polarized along party lines , the GOP had nothing to gain from helping the Democrats successfully govern the country \u2014 and much to gain from his electoral opponents \u2019 failure .\nWhatever the case , he had the perfect tool with which to slow Democrats \u2019 work to a crawl : the Senate filibuster .\nMcConnell \u2019 s minority filibustered to try to block not only controversial bills and nominations but also uncontroversial ones . The filibuster became an omnipresent threat through which McConnell could extract concessions , delay action , or waste precious Senate floor time . \u201c He ramped up the tactics of mass obstruction in a way we had never seen before , \u201d says Ornstein .\nTo prevent Democrats from getting the 60 votes they needed to override a filibuster , McConnell had to keep his Republicans unified in opposition \u2014 especially once the Affordable Care Act began moving through the chamber .\nIn 2009 , McConnell spent months trying to ensure that not even one Republican would vote for Obamacare\nMcConnell writes in his book that he \u201c didn \u2019 t want a single Republican to vote for \u201d the bill because \u201c it had to be very obvious to the voters which party was responsible for this terrible policy. \u201d For months , he continued , his efforts to ensure every Republican voted no \u201c consumed nearly all of my time . \u201d\nFrom Democrats \u2019 perspective , McConnell forfeited the opportunity to help shape , and did everything he could to block , legislation that would help millions of uninsured Americans \u2014 all to align himself with the energized conservative base that had come to loathe Barack Obama . \u201c The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president , \u201d McConnell infamously said in October 2010 .\nAnd yet some conservatives still wondered whether he could have done more to stop the bill from becoming law . \u201c We negotiated unanimous consent agreements [ to let the Senate function ] every day \u201d rather than trying to \u201c aggressively disrupt Reid \u2019 s process , \u201d says James Wallner , a former Senate and Heritage Foundation staffer . \u201c All McConnell cared about , it seemed to me , was keeping all Republicans against the bill . He is focused primarily on elections . \u201d\nThe Affordable Care Act passed during a brief window of opportunity when Democrats had 60 senators . It also helped contribute to sweeping Republican gains in the 2010 midterms \u2014 albeit gains that weren \u2019 t large enough to give McConnell has long-coveted majority just yet . That Rubik \u2019 s cube wasn \u2019 t yet solved .\nRepublicans got part of what they wanted . They controlled the House of Representatives starting in 2011 . But the new class of conservatives was more extreme than the ones McConnell had worked with over the years \u2014 and this presented him with a problem .\nDespite lacking control of the presidency and the Senate , these new conservatives and the activists backing were demanding sweeping change \u2014 demands that , in McConnell \u2019 s views , were often unrealistic . So McConnell took on a new legislative role , of managing his party \u2019 s extreme elements , so he could better help them win the next election .\nTrey Grayson , a former Kentucky secretary of state who was allied with McConnell , sums it up this way : \u201c I think with him , there \u2019 s this realization : \u2018 Okay , the Republican electorate is here . I \u2019 m gon na have to adapt to these folks . I \u2019 m gon na give them some rope to run with . And I \u2019 ve got to make sure they don \u2019 t hang themselves with it . \u201d\nIt was a complicated dance , because McConnell also wanted to remain on the good side of conservative base elements that had flexed their muscles in several recent primary fights . So often \u2014 in the debt ceiling fight of 2011 , the fiscal cliff of 2012 , and the government shutdown of 2013 \u2014 he \u2019 d hang back in the opening rounds of conflict . Only later would he step in to cut deals that preserved the status quo after the House \u2019 s hardline tactics had clearly failed .\n\u201c He knew it would be a disaster to breach the debt ceiling . He knew it would be a disaster to go over the fiscal cliff . He knew it would be a disaster to shut down the government , though he was unable to avoid that one , \u201d says Jentleson , the former Reid aide . \u201c He thought making deals in those cases were good politics . \u201d\nBut though his tactics on legislation shifted , his approached to nominations remained the same . Since only the Senate gets to approve appointees , Republican filibusters remained the only tool the GOP had to block any nominees they found objectionable . McConnell therefore ramped up his use of holds and filibusters ever further .\nAccording to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report , the Senate had attempted to overcome a filibuster on nominations 168 times since 1949 \u2014 and 82 of those attempts , nearly half of the total , had occurred during Obama \u2019 s presidency alone . For the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in particular \u2014 which has jurisdiction on many regulatory cases impacting businesses , and which the GOP therefore very much wanted to keep in conservative hands \u2014 Republicans made clear they \u2019 d block any Obama nominee .\nAll this eventually proved to be a bridge too far for Democrats . In 2013 , Harry Reid used the \u201c nuclear option \u201d to ram through a Senate rules change that would eliminate the filibuster for all nominations except Supreme Court picks . McConnell still had certain tactics he could use to delay appointments , but he had been stripped of his best tool for blocking them outright .\nIt was this that spurred McConnell to deliver his January 2014 speech on \u201c Restoring the Senate. \u201d In it , he made his case for the chamber \u2019 s importance as a consensus-building institution and laid out what he \u2019 d do differently if he were in charge . \u201c When the majority leader decided a few weeks back to defy bipartisan opposition by changing the rules that govern this place with a simple majority vote , he broke something , \u201d McConnell said .\nIn contrast , he vowed to restore the Senate to its former glories should the GOP win the majority . Under his leadership , bills would go through the traditional committee process . If he proposed a sweeping bill and couldn \u2019 t get any Democratic support , he \u2019 d conclude that \u201c maybe this isn \u2019 t such a great idea . \u201d\nHe finished with a stirring exhortation . \u201c Restoring this institution is the only way we \u2019 ll ever solve the challenges we face . That \u2019 s the lesson of history and experience . And we would all be wise to heed it . \u201d\nRepublicans finally took the Senate in the 2014 midterms , and at long last made McConnell majority leader \u2014 just in time for a crisis .\nThat crisis was the death of Justice Antonin Scalia during Obama \u2019 s final year as president . If Obama got to fill that vacancy , liberals would get their first majority on the Court in decades . Conservative activists who \u2019 d long deeply cared about the Court \u2019 s makeup \u2014 some for religious reasons , others because they disliked big government \u2014 were terrified .\nMcConnell \u2019 s audacious response \u2014 preventing the Senate from even holding hearings on Obama \u2019 s nominee , Merrick Garland , and then ramming through a rules change to confirm Donald Trump \u2019 s nominee , Neil Gorsuch \u2014 will play a central role in his legacy .\n\u201c The best of McConnell \u2019 s legacy from my perspective is probably going to be Gorsuch , \u201d says Jason Pye of Freedomworks . \u201c He took a lot of pressure on [ blocking Garland ] , and I commend him for it . \u201d\nBut though many liberals believe McConnell pulled off a masterful heist here , in many ways he was merely accelerating the inevitable .\nIf the Senate did vote on Garland in 2016 , Republican senators almost surely would have voted him down \u2014 just as Democrats would have should a similar situation have arisen in a GOP president \u2019 s final year . This was , after all , a monumentally important swing vote seat that could tip the balance on the Court on a host of issues . Both parties faced immense pressure to secure it .\nAnd as far as eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations , Democrats were preparing to do just that while they expected to win the 2016 election . ( Indeed , blockading Garland was a risky gamble for this reason , since Hillary Clinton was expected to appoint a more liberal choice if she won . ) In reality , judicial nominations had become so polarized and politicized that the supermajority requirement couldn \u2019 t last .\nStill , McConnell managed to overdeliver for his base by refusing to even hold hearings on Garland \u2019 s nomination . Many other politicians in his position would have at least gone through the motions of considering the president \u2019 s pick . McConnell didn \u2019 t bother to pretend .\nHis legacy here is a further politicization of the judiciary \u2014 he has set the precedent that if the Senate and presidency are controlled by opposite parties , the Senate doesn \u2019 t even have to consider the president \u2019 s pick . But that may be a legacy he can live with , considering he successfully kept the Supreme Court of the United States in conservatives \u2019 hands , perhaps for decades .\nAll this time , however , McConnell has still lacked a transformative legislative achievement to his name \u2014 which brings us to the Senate health care bill .\nSold as a \u201c repeal and replacement \u201d of Obamacare ( a slogan invented by one of McConnell \u2019 s staffers back in 2010 ) , the core of the latest version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act would cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars of federal government spending from the health care system . Medicaid , the program covering millions of low-income Americans , would be hit hardest .\nMcConnell would also reveal many of Republicans \u2019 promises on health reform to be utterly fraudulent . He himself has criticized Obamacare for failing to cover enough Americans , and for sending premiums and deductibles soaring . Yet according to the Congressional Budget Office \u2019 s analysis , the Senate \u2019 s bill would lead to 22 million fewer Americans being insured by 2026 , and send premiums and deductibles so high that \u201c few low-income people would purchase any plan . \u201d\nMeanwhile , many conservatives are disappointed with the GOP bill for a different reason \u2014 they believe it leaves far too much of Obamacare in place . That \u2019 s because , despite the dramatic Medicaid cuts , the bill leaves in place much of the individual insurance market structure the Affordable Care Act created , complete with regulations on what plans can be sold and income-based subsidies .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think anybody can honestly call this bill Obamacare repeal , \u201d Pye told me after McConnell released his initial discussion draft ( which has since been changed ) . \u201c At most it \u2019 s a Medicaid modernization bill . But he said we \u2019 re gon na repeal Obamacare \u2018 root and branch \u2019 ; that was the promise for the better part of a decade . That \u2019 s not what we \u2019 re doing here . We \u2019 re fiddling around the edges . \u201d\nYet in shying away from full repeal , McConnell is merely going along with the desires of most of his Republican senators \u2014 who fear doing away with popular Obamacare planks such as its protections for people with preexisting conditions .\nIn describing how McConnell legislates , his former aide Josh Holmes recently told CNN : \u201c The product is always a direct reflection of the views of his conference \u2014 not his own dictation . \u201d\nMcConnell appears to have calculated that the only way he can pass such a controversial bill is using a remarkable process in which he relies on stealth and speed . He \u2019 s bypassed the two committees with jurisdiction over health issues , crafted the first ( and now the second ) Senate bill behind closed doors , is ignoring the bill \u2019 s dramatic unpopularity , and hopes to quickly bring it to a vote and strong-arm his senators into passing it on party lines .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the process in and of itself is good for the institution , \u201d Wallner , the conservative former Senate and Heritage Foundation staffer , says . \u201c I think it \u2019 s doing long-lasting damage to the institution as part of an ongoing trend where things are getting worse . \u201d\nIndeed , all this violates promise after promise McConnell made in his 2014 speech about how he \u2019 d run the Senate \u2014 that he \u2019 d restore the traditional committee process , and that he doesn \u2019 t think major , transformative legislation should be written behind closed doors and passed with only partisan support .\nRegardless of how things turn out , he \u2019 s already matched and indeed far exceeded all of his criticisms of the process Democratic senators used to pass the law in the first place . And he \u2019 s set new precedents that future Senate majorities could use to justify ramming their own controversial new laws through budget reconciliation .\n\u201c To be a statesman , you have to win the election \u201d\nAnd yet except for Gorsuch \u2019 s confirmation and the as-yet-unresolved fight over the health care bill , the Senate in the first few months of Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency has been surprisingly sleepy .\nRepublicans have spent time confirming President Trump \u2019 s nominees , which they can do without Democratic support . They \u2019 ve used a special filibuster-proof process to strike down several regulations that were passed late in President Obama \u2019 s term , the window for which has now expired . And they \u2019 ve worked on bipartisan bills , like an omnibus spending package and a toughening of sanctions on Iran and Russia .\n\u201c That \u2019 s not a lot to go on in six months , \u201d admits the McConnell insider . \u201c It has been a very kind of monotonous and thin slice of stuff this year . \u201d\nThis is the case for one main reason : the filibuster , which is still entirely intact for legislation .\nBecause the GOP only controls 52 Senate seats , they can not beat a filibuster , unless they use the special limited budget reconciliation process \u2014 or unless they win the votes of at least eight Democrats .\nAs a consequence , major conservative bill after major conservative bill has passed the House , only to go nowhere in the Senate \u2014 hamstringing Republican ambitions for sweeping legislative change in this rare period of unified party control of Washington . Trump , for one , is frustrated :\neither elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51 % . Our country needs a good `` shutdown '' in September to fix mess ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 2 , 2017\nThe U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes , immediately , and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved , fast and easy . Dems would do it , no doubt ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 30 , 2017\nBut McConnell has shown no inclination to ditch the filibuster for legislation . \u201c That will not happen , \u201d he said in May , after Trump first tweeted on the topic . \u201c It would fundamentally change how the Senate has worked for a very long time . \u201d\nPerhaps McConnell is preserving the legislative filibuster because he or his backers think doing so better serves conservatives \u2019 interests in the long term \u2014 either by blocking liberal laws in times of Democratic majorities or by forcing whatever gets through a Republican House to moderate . Or perhaps he simply knows he couldn \u2019 t win enough support for this rules change .\nWhatever the case , this is one important example where McConnell has defied the cynical liberal caricature of him \u2014 for now , at least . ( Many liberals long predicted that as soon as Republicans had unified control again , they \u2019 d eliminate the filibuster . ) Instead , his Senate has ended up as the only bulwark against controversial conservative bills , and forced the GOP to rely on a reconciliation-or-bust strategy for major change .\nDespite all this , McConnell \u2019 s flouting of so many Senate norms to advance Republicans \u2019 sweeping health bill may be doing irrevocable damage to the chamber . Whether he succeeds or fails in passing the health bill , future majorities have a precedent for ramming partisan legislation crafted in secret through the budget reconciliation process quickly . That is one major legacy he has already cemented . The loss of health insurance for tens of millions of Americans may yet be another .\nIn many ways , though , the majority leader is merely following his party . \u201c If the Republican Party were composed of different elements today \u2014 let \u2019 s say it looked more like the GOP of the 1980s \u2014 I think McConnell would be a different kind of leader , \u201d says Trey Grayson , the former Kentucky secretary of state .\n\u201c He wants to be known as a great leader . And he knows to be remembered as a great leader in history , he probably has to achieve some things in a bipartisan manner to solve big problems .\n\u201c But he \u2019 s also a realist . And he told me once , \u2018 To be a statesman , you have to win the election . \u2019 \u201d",

But it didn\u2019t happen \u2014 his party lost the Senate, and he would start his stint as top Senate Republican with only a minority to lead.\n\nObstructionist-in-chief\n\nOver the next eight years, McConnell would struggle with another Rubik\u2019s cube of sorts: How could he best use his powers in the minority to win the majority?\n\nHis twists and turns of that cube would reshape how American politics worked.\n\nIn 2008, with Democrats controlling every lever of power, he quickly calculated he had little to gain from helping his opponents\u2019 agenda become law.\n\nThe sympathetic view of his actions is that he concluded Democrats were exploiting the crisis to ram through a liberal agenda the country didn\u2019t support \u2014 and decided to fight back.\n\nA more cynical interpretation is that he realized that in a political system increasingly polarized along party lines, the GOP had nothing to gain from helping the Democrats successfully govern the country \u2014 and much to gain from his electoral opponents\u2019 failure.\n\nWhatever the case, he had the perfect tool with which to slow Democrats\u2019 work to a crawl: the Senate filibuster.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s minority filibustered to try to block not only controversial bills and nominations but also uncontroversial ones. The filibuster became an omnipresent threat through which McConnell could extract concessions, delay action, or waste precious Senate floor time. \u201cHe ramped up the tactics of mass obstruction in a way we had never seen before,\u201d says Ornstein.\n\nTo prevent Democrats from getting the 60 votes they needed to override a filibuster, McConnell had to keep his Republicans unified in opposition \u2014 especially once the Affordable Care Act began moving through the chamber.\n\nIn 2009, McConnell spent months trying to ensure that not even one Republican would vote for Obamacare\n\nMcConnell writes in his book that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a single Republican to vote for\u201d the bill because \u201cit had to be very obvious to the voters which party was responsible for this terrible policy.\u201d For months, he continued, his efforts to ensure every Republican voted no \u201cconsumed nearly all of my time.\u201d\n\nFrom Democrats\u2019 perspective, McConnell forfeited the opportunity to help shape, and did everything he could to block, legislation that would help millions of uninsured Americans \u2014 all to align himself with the energized conservative base that had come to loathe Barack Obama. \u201cThe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president,\u201d McConnell infamously said in October 2010.\n\nAnd yet some conservatives still wondered whether he could have done more to stop the bill from becoming law. \u201cWe negotiated unanimous consent agreements [to let the Senate function] every day\u201d rather than trying to \u201caggressively disrupt Reid\u2019s process,\u201d says James Wallner, a former Senate and Heritage Foundation staffer. \u201cAll McConnell cared about, it seemed to me, was keeping all Republicans against the bill. He is focused primarily on elections.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act passed during a brief window of opportunity when Democrats had 60 senators. It also helped contribute to sweeping Republican gains in the 2010 midterms \u2014 albeit gains that weren\u2019t large enough to give McConnell has long-coveted majority just yet. That Rubik\u2019s cube wasn\u2019t yet solved.\n\nManaging a more extreme party\n\nRepublicans got part of what they wanted. They controlled the House of Representatives starting in 2011. But the new class of conservatives was more extreme than the ones McConnell had worked with over the years \u2014 and this presented him with a problem.\n\nDespite lacking control of the presidency and the Senate, these new conservatives and the activists backing were demanding sweeping change \u2014 demands that, in McConnell\u2019s views, were often unrealistic. So McConnell took on a new legislative role, of managing his party\u2019s extreme elements, so he could better help them win the next election.\n\nTrey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state who was allied with McConnell, sums it up this way: \u201cI think with him, there\u2019s this realization: \u2018Okay, the Republican electorate is here. I\u2019m gonna have to adapt to these folks. I\u2019m gonna give them some rope to run with. And I\u2019ve got to make sure they don\u2019t hang themselves with it.\u201d\n\nIt was a complicated dance, because McConnell also wanted to remain on the good side of conservative base elements that had flexed their muscles in several recent primary fights. So often \u2014 in the debt ceiling fight of 2011, the fiscal cliff of 2012, and the government shutdown of 2013 \u2014 he\u2019d hang back in the opening rounds of conflict. Only later would he step in to cut deals that preserved the status quo after the House\u2019s hardline tactics had clearly failed.\n\n\u201cHe knew it would be a disaster to breach the debt ceiling. He knew it would be a disaster to go over the fiscal cliff. He knew it would be a disaster to shut down the government, though he was unable to avoid that one,\u201d says Jentleson, the former Reid aide. \u201cHe thought making deals in those cases were good politics.\u201d\n\nBut though his tactics on legislation shifted, his approached to nominations remained the same. Since only the Senate gets to approve appointees, Republican filibusters remained the only tool the GOP had to block any nominees they found objectionable. McConnell therefore ramped up his use of holds and filibusters ever further.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report, the Senate had attempted to overcome a filibuster on nominations 168 times since 1949 \u2014 and 82 of those attempts, nearly half of the total, had occurred during Obama\u2019s presidency alone. For the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in particular \u2014 which has jurisdiction on many regulatory cases impacting businesses, and which the GOP therefore very much wanted to keep in conservative hands \u2014 Republicans made clear they\u2019d block any Obama nominee.\n\nAll this eventually proved to be a bridge too far for Democrats. In 2013, Harry Reid used the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to ram through a Senate rules change that would eliminate the filibuster for all nominations except Supreme Court picks. McConnell still had certain tactics he could use to delay appointments, but he had been stripped of his best tool for blocking them outright.\n\nIt was this that spurred McConnell to deliver his January 2014 speech on \u201cRestoring the Senate.\u201d In it, he made his case for the chamber\u2019s importance as a consensus-building institution and laid out what he\u2019d do differently if he were in charge. \u201cWhen the majority leader decided a few weeks back to defy bipartisan opposition by changing the rules that govern this place with a simple majority vote, he broke something,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nIn contrast, he vowed to restore the Senate to its former glories should the GOP win the majority. Under his leadership, bills would go through the traditional committee process. If he proposed a sweeping bill and couldn\u2019t get any Democratic support, he\u2019d conclude that \u201cmaybe this isn\u2019t such a great idea.\u201d\n\nHe finished with a stirring exhortation. \u201cRestoring this institution is the only way we\u2019ll ever solve the challenges we face. That\u2019s the lesson of history and experience. And we would all be wise to heed it.\u201d\n\nThe Garland gamble\n\nRepublicans finally took the Senate in the 2014 midterms, and at long last made McConnell majority leader \u2014 just in time for a crisis.\n\nThat crisis was the death of Justice Antonin Scalia during Obama\u2019s final year as president. If Obama got to fill that vacancy, liberals would get their first majority on the Court in decades. Conservative activists who\u2019d long deeply cared about the Court\u2019s makeup \u2014 some for religious reasons, others because they disliked big government \u2014 were terrified.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s audacious response \u2014 preventing the Senate from even holding hearings on Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, and then ramming through a rules change to confirm Donald Trump\u2019s nominee, Neil Gorsuch \u2014 will play a central role in his legacy.\n\n\u201cThe best of McConnell\u2019s legacy from my perspective is probably going to be Gorsuch,\u201d says Jason Pye of Freedomworks. \u201cHe took a lot of pressure on [blocking Garland], and I commend him for it.\u201d\n\nBut though many liberals believe McConnell pulled off a masterful heist here, in many ways he was merely accelerating the inevitable.\n\nIf the Senate did vote on Garland in 2016, Republican senators almost surely would have voted him down \u2014 just as Democrats would have should a similar situation have arisen in a GOP president\u2019s final year. This was, after all, a monumentally important swing vote seat that could tip the balance on the Court on a host of issues. Both parties faced immense pressure to secure it.\n\nAnd as far as eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, Democrats were preparing to do just that while they expected to win the 2016 election. (Indeed, blockading Garland was a risky gamble for this reason, since Hillary Clinton was expected to appoint a more liberal choice if she won.) In reality, judicial nominations had become so polarized and politicized that the supermajority requirement couldn\u2019t last.\n\nStill, McConnell managed to overdeliver for his base by refusing to even hold hearings on Garland\u2019s nomination. Many other politicians in his position would have at least gone through the motions of considering the president\u2019s pick. McConnell didn\u2019t bother to pretend.\n\nHis legacy here is a further politicization of the judiciary \u2014 he has set the precedent that if the Senate and presidency are controlled by opposite parties, the Senate doesn\u2019t even have to consider the president\u2019s pick. But that may be a legacy he can live with, considering he successfully kept the Supreme Court of the United States in conservatives\u2019 hands, perhaps for decades.\n\nThe biggest test yet: the health care bill\n\nAll this time, however, McConnell has still lacked a transformative legislative achievement to his name \u2014 which brings us to the Senate health care bill.\n\nSold as a \u201crepeal and replacement\u201d of Obamacare (a slogan invented by one of McConnell\u2019s staffers back in 2010), the core of the latest version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act would cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars of federal government spending from the health care system. Medicaid, the program covering millions of low-income Americans, would be hit hardest.\n\nMcConnell would also reveal many of Republicans\u2019 promises on health reform to be utterly fraudulent. He himself has criticized Obamacare for failing to cover enough Americans, and for sending premiums and deductibles soaring. Yet according to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis, the Senate\u2019s bill would lead to 22 million fewer Americans being insured by 2026, and send premiums and deductibles so high that \u201cfew low-income people would purchase any plan.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many conservatives are disappointed with the GOP bill for a different reason \u2014 they believe it leaves far too much of Obamacare in place. That\u2019s because, despite the dramatic Medicaid cuts, the bill leaves in place much of the individual insurance market structure the Affordable Care Act created, complete with regulations on what plans can be sold and income-based subsidies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can honestly call this bill Obamacare repeal,\u201d Pye told me after McConnell released his initial discussion draft (which has since been changed). \u201cAt most it\u2019s a Medicaid modernization bill. But he said we\u2019re gonna repeal Obamacare \u2018root and branch\u2019; that was the promise for the better part of a decade. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing here. We\u2019re fiddling around the edges.\u201d\n\nYet in shying away from full repeal, McConnell is merely going along with the desires of most of his Republican senators \u2014 who fear doing away with popular Obamacare planks such as its protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nIn describing how McConnell legislates, his former aide Josh Holmes recently told CNN: \u201cThe product is always a direct reflection of the views of his conference \u2014 not his own dictation.\u201d\n\nMcConnell appears to have calculated that the only way he can pass such a controversial bill is using a remarkable process in which he relies on stealth and speed. He\u2019s bypassed the two committees with jurisdiction over health issues, crafted the first (and now the second) Senate bill behind closed doors, is ignoring the bill\u2019s dramatic unpopularity, and hopes to quickly bring it to a vote and strong-arm his senators into passing it on party lines.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the process in and of itself is good for the institution,\u201d Wallner, the conservative former Senate and Heritage Foundation staffer, says. \u201cI think it\u2019s doing long-lasting damage to the institution as part of an ongoing trend where things are getting worse.\u201d\n\nIndeed, all this violates promise after promise McConnell made in his 2014 speech about how he\u2019d run the Senate \u2014 that he\u2019d restore the traditional committee process, and that he doesn\u2019t think major, transformative legislation should be written behind closed doors and passed with only partisan support.\n\nRegardless of how things turn out, he\u2019s already matched and indeed far exceeded all of his criticisms of the process Democratic senators used to pass the law in the first place. And he\u2019s set new precedents that future Senate majorities could use to justify ramming their own controversial new laws through budget reconciliation.\n\n\u201cTo be a statesman, you have to win the election\u201d\n\nAnd yet except for Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation and the as-yet-unresolved fight over the health care bill, the Senate in the first few months of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been surprisingly sleepy.\n\nRepublicans have spent time confirming President Trump\u2019s nominees, which they can do without Democratic support. They\u2019ve used a special filibuster-proof process to strike down several regulations that were passed late in President Obama\u2019s term, the window for which has now expired. And they\u2019ve worked on bipartisan bills, like an omnibus spending package and a toughening of sanctions on Iran and Russia.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a lot to go on in six months,\u201d admits the McConnell insider. \u201cIt has been a very kind of monotonous and thin slice of stuff this year.\u201d\n\nThis is the case for one main reason: the filibuster, which is still entirely intact for legislation.\n\nBecause the GOP only controls 52 Senate seats, they cannot beat a filibuster, unless they use the special limited budget reconciliation process \u2014 or unless they win the votes of at least eight Democrats.\n\nAs a consequence, major conservative bill after major conservative bill has passed the House, only to go nowhere in the Senate \u2014 hamstringing Republican ambitions for sweeping legislative change in this rare period of unified party control of Washington. Trump, for one, is frustrated:\n\neither elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good \"shutdown\" in September to fix mess! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017\n\nThe U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy. Dems would do it, no doubt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2017\n\nBut McConnell has shown no inclination to ditch the filibuster for legislation. \u201cThat will not happen,\u201d he said in May, after Trump first tweeted on the topic. \u201cIt would fundamentally change how the Senate has worked for a very long time.\u201d\n\nPerhaps McConnell is preserving the legislative filibuster because he or his backers think doing so better serves conservatives\u2019 interests in the long term \u2014 either by blocking liberal laws in times of Democratic majorities or by forcing whatever gets through a Republican House to moderate. Or perhaps he simply knows he couldn\u2019t win enough support for this rules change.\n\nWhatever the case, this is one important example where McConnell has defied the cynical liberal caricature of him \u2014 for now, at least. (Many liberals long predicted that as soon as Republicans had unified control again, they\u2019d eliminate the filibuster.) Instead, his Senate has ended up as the only bulwark against controversial conservative bills, and forced the GOP to rely on a reconciliation-or-bust strategy for major change.\n\nDespite all this, McConnell\u2019s flouting of so many Senate norms to advance Republicans\u2019 sweeping health bill may be doing irrevocable damage to the chamber. Whether he succeeds or fails in passing the health bill, future majorities have a precedent for ramming partisan legislation crafted in secret through the budget reconciliation process quickly. That is one major legacy he has already cemented. The loss of health insurance for tens of millions of Americans may yet be another.\n\nIn many ways, though, the majority leader is merely following his party. \u201cIf the Republican Party were composed of different elements today \u2014 let\u2019s say it looked more like the GOP of the 1980s \u2014 I think McConnell would be a different kind of leader,\u201d says Trey Grayson, the former Kentucky secretary of state.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be known as a great leader. And he knows to be remembered as a great leader in history, he probably has to achieve some things in a bipartisan manner to solve big problems.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s also a realist. And he told me once, \u2018To be a statesman, you have to win the election.\u2019\u201d",
