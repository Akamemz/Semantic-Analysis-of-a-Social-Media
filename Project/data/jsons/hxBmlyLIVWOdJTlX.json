    "content": "The St. Louis County grand jury that declined to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old , heard wildly contrasting testimony , including witness accounts that the hulking Brown was charging at Officer Darren Wilson when he was shot , and Wilson 's own claim that Brown taunted him as he grabbed for his gun , saying , `` you are too much of a p -- -- to shoot me . ''\nThe grand jury decision came late Monday in Missouri after more than 70 hours of testimony from roughly 60 witnesses , spanning 25 days over three months , and touched off fresh looting and rioting on the streets of Ferguson and St. Louis . As the 12 members of the grand jury heard evidence in closed proceedings , claims from purported witnesses and civil rights activists told the tale of a youth gunned down mercilessly as he held his hands up in surrender . But the grand jurors , including six white men , three white women , two black women and one black man , were told a different story .\nBrown \u201c has his arms out with attitude , \u201d while \u201c The cop just stood there , \u201d one witness to the shooting that capped the noon-time confrontation testified . \u201c Dang if that kid didn \u2019 t start running right at the cop like a football player . Head down . \u201d\nThe fatal shots came after a 90-second encounter that , Wilson told the grand jury , began when he saw Brown and a friend , Dorian Johnson , walking in the street on Aug. 9 . The police officer said he told them to move to the sidewalk , which drew an expletive from Brown . Wilson noticed that Brown had a handful of cigars , \u201c and that \u2019 s when it clicked for [ him ] \u201d that the men were suspects in a theft at a convenience store reported just minutes earlier .\nWilson , 28 , said he called for backup before maneuvering his vehicle in front of Brown and his friend . Wilson , who is much smaller than the 6-foot , 4-inch , 290-pound Brown was , told the panel of being attacked and in fear for his life as Brown slammed his squad car door on him and pummeled him through the window moments after Wilson confronted him walking in the middle of the street .\nWilson testified that , \u201c I felt like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan. \u201d The cop added , \u201c Hulk Hogan , that \u2019 s just how big he felt and how small I felt just from grasping his arm . \u201d\n\u201c What do I do not to get beaten inside my car ? \u201d Wilson asked grand jurors .\nThe officer said he drew his handgun and threatened to shoot Brown if he didn \u2019 t retreat , fearing another punch to the face could \u201c knock [ him ] out \u201d or incapacitate him .\n\u201c He immediately grabs my gun and says , \u2018 You are too much of a [ p -- -- ] to shoot me ' , \u201d said Wilson , adding that he thought he would be shot when Brown dug the gun into the officer \u2019 s hip .\nWilson said he managed to pull the trigger and the gun \u201c clicked \u201d twice without firing before a shot blasted through the window . Brown , according to Wilson , then stepped back and glared at the officer with the \u201c most intense , aggressive \u201d face .\n\u201c The only way I can describe it , it looks like a demon , that \u2019 s how angry he looked , \u201d Wilson told the grand jury . \u201c He comes back toward me again with his hands up . \u201d\nWilson shielded his face and fired again , telling the grand jury he fired two shots in the car before the unarmed teen fled and Wilson followed . When Brown stopped , Wilson told him to get on the ground . Wilson said he fired a series of shots when Brown kept approaching him with his right hand under his shirt in the waistband of his pants .\nWilson then fired another round of shots as Brown approached Wilson as if he was going to tackle the officer .\n\u201c Just coming straight at me like he was going to run right through me , \u201d Wilson said . \u201c And when he gets about \u2026 8 to 10 feet away \u2026 all I see is his head and that \u2019 s what I shot . \u201d\nJohnson 's version of events differed in key respects . He told the grand jury he expected to be arrested while they were walking home after Brown stole cigarillos from a liquor store . Wilson , Johnson said , initially drove past the men after originally telling them to get onto the sidewalk , reversing his patrol car and returning to the pair after they ignored his demand .\n\u201c After he pulled back , there was no more sidewalk talk , it was nothing , it was just anger , \u201d Johnson told the grand jury .\nWilson opened his door suddenly , Johnson said , striking Brown before closing the door and grabbing Brown by the neck . The two men engaged in a \u201c tug of war , \u201d Johnson said , with each holding onto the other \u2019 s shirt and arms .\nJohnson said he heard Wilson say , \u201c I \u2019 ll shoot ! \u201d as the men grappled . Johnson said he never saw Brown punch Wilson and didn \u2019 t think he grabbed the officer \u2019 s gun .\n\u201c At the time I couldn \u2019 t open my mouth , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c I couldn \u2019 t speak . I wanted to say could someone calm down \u2026 I \u2019 m still standing there , more shocked than ever because I see it is escalating . I can see and hear the cuss words , I can see the frowns on their faces getting more intense . \u201d\nJohnson said he and Brown fled after the initial shots were fired . Brown stopped and turned to face the officer , however , after Wilson shot again .\n\u201c At that time Big Mike \u2019 s hands was up , but not so much in the air , because he had been struck \u2026 he said , ' I don \u2019 t have a gun , ' but he \u2019 s still mad , he still has his angry face , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c I don \u2019 t have a gun \u2026 and before he can say the second sentence or before he can even get it out , that \u2019 s when the several more shots came . \u201d\nJohnson insisted Brown did not run at the officer prior to the fatal shots .\n\u201c Some witnesses maintained their original statement that Mr. Brown had his hands in the air and was not moving toward the officer when he was shot , \u201d St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch said . \u201c Several witnesses said Mr. Brown did not raise his hands at all or that he raised them briefly and then dropped them and then turned toward Officer Wilson , who then fired several rounds . \u201d\nOne witness whose name was not listed in the grand jury transcripts testified he was working in a nearby building and saw Brown leaning through the police vehicle window and \u201c some sort of confrontation \u201d took place . A shot rang out , he said , and Brown fled as the officer chased him with his gun drawn . Brown stopped , according to the witness , but never raised his hands . Brown \u201c ran towards the officer full charge , \u201d he said , when Wilson fired several shots .\nAnother witness testified she and her husband saw the shooting from a nearby apartment complex . After the first two shots were fired , she said Brown began running from Wilson \u2019 s vehicle but stopped , turned around and started heading toward Wilson , who shot at him .\n\u201c No , he wasn \u2019 t , \u201d the witness said when asked if it appeared Brown was approaching Wilson in a threatening fashion . \u201c I think he was stunned , honestly . \u201d\n\u201c He just kept walking toward the officer , \u201d she told the grand jury . \u201c He didn \u2019 t stop . \u201d\nThe Justice Department will continue to investigate the shooting for evidence of a potential civil rights violation , although the federal investigators face a higher burden of proof to establish whether Wilson willfully deprived Brown of his civil rights .
