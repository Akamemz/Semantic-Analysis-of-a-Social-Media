    "content": "The Senate judiciary committee hearing on Thursday was a bizarre set of contradictions . On the one hand , the Republican senators were superficially respectful to Christine Blasey Ford : they repeatedly asked her what she needed , hired a female prosecutor to question her , and largely refrained from the kind of denigrating slurs that allowed the media to label Anita Hill \u201c a little nutty and a little slutty \u201d 27 years ago .\nOn the other hand , the whole thing also felt strikingly retrograde , with a woman \u2019 s emotional testimony all but ignored as Republican senators deferred to the righteous indignation of a white man . It illuminated what a strange moment we \u2019 re now in , demonstrating how much has changed for American women , and simultaneously how little has .\nIt was apparently the power of these contradictions that shook Republican senator Jeff Flake , who \u2013 having announced he would vote yes on advancing Kavanaugh \u2019 s nomination \u2013 pivoted dramatically at the last minute , declaring that his vote was contingent on a further FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh .\nThe day was a study in contrasts . Ford came across as deferential , nervous and deeply concerned with accuracy . Her opening statement was powerfully specific ; at one point , she talked about having put a second front door on her house , because the aftereffects of the attack had made her so nervous about being able to escape her own house . She smiled , spoke quietly , and repeatedly used humor to lighten the weight of what she was saying . \u201c I \u2019 m used to being collegial , \u201d she even said at one point after the senators asked if she wanted a break and she asked them if it was a \u201c good time \u201d . She never tried to score political points .\nJudge Kavanaugh came across as an angry bully bent on intimidation , and entirely willing to exploit political anger . He alternated between yelling and weeping ( and , oddly , sniffing ) , at times conveying a real sense of the toll these allegations took on his family , at other times merely screaming his CV in all caps . He took a Trumpian approach , claiming the day \u2019 s hearing was a \u201c national disgrace \u201d caused by a \u201c frenzy on the left \u201d who \u201c were lying in wait and had it ready \u201d . He portrayed the allegations against him as politically motivated \u201c last-minute smears \u201d . His was a performance of indignant \u2013 some might say petulant \u2013 rage , shot through with the self-pity of a man who felt it was outrageous for him to be questioned in this manner .\nThe deferential good girl , the brazen , powerful man \u2013 the showdown was almost cinematic , but this wasn \u2019 t even the most striking thing about the day . Equally striking was the odd , folded tension in the Republican senators \u2019 self-presentation . The Republicans on the committee ( all 11 are men ) were careful to avoid the appearance of grilling Ford as they had grilled Anita Hill in 1991 , the optics of which now look terrible . ( Instead Rachel Mitchell , a prosecutor from Arizona , asked many of their questions . ) They performed a kind of stilted politeness and freely called Ford \u201c credible \u201d . Orrin Hatch went so far as to say she was an \u201c attractive \u201d and \u201c pleasing \u201d witness . ( His choice of words in itself spoke volumes about where the Republican party still is when it comes to women . )\nThe hearing was truly a courtesy , as Chuck Grassley put it , and nothing more .\nAnd yet they showed little interest in actually listening to Ford \u2019 s grave testimony . The hearing was truly a courtesy , as Chuck Grassley put it , and nothing more . By the day \u2019 s end , the senators were portraying the hearing \u2019 s findings as a simple he-said/she-said standoff , in which a lack of corroborating evidence to support Ford \u2019 s testimony all but forced them to vote for Kavanaugh . In doing so , they were misrepresenting the facts \u2013 and shirking their institutional duty , as the Democrats kept pointing out : they had the option of asking the FBI to extend its background check into Kavanaugh . Yet none of the Republican senators paused to examine the cognitive dissonance of how they could both find Ford credible and decide to \u201c plow \u201d right ahead with the nomination . None acknowledged how blatantly they were dismissing the real point of the # MeToo movement : that institutions must seriously investigate allegations of sexual misconduct .\nThe hollowness of the proceedings put a fine point on our new political reality . On the one hand , norms have changed , and even the Republican party has realized it can \u2019 t score points by personally attacking those who say they are victims of sexual assault .

They professed to believe Ford , at least in some fashion , and yet they let Kavanaugh get the last word .
