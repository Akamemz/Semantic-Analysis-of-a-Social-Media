The blunt former prosecutor is an inimitable national GOP star who last month eclipsed a 50 percent approval rating and will bring a national fundraising network to bear if he decides to pursue a second term. His in-your-face style may be wearing thin on some, but taking him out is another matter.\n\nAnd that makes the calculus considerably trickier for Democrats.\n\nBooker is seen as keeping his powder dry for a shot at a U.S. Senate seat. One top ranking Garden State Democrat told POLITICO Booker was candid about why he\u2019s not running for governor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Christie can be beaten,\u201d the mayor said in a private conversation earlier this year, according to the Democrat.\n\nBooker political adviser Mark Matzen didn\u2019t dispute the account \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he said it or not\u201d \u2014 but attempted to crack the door back open for his client, insisting a bid for governor hasn\u2019t been ruled out.\n\n\u201cWhen the mayor says he\u2019s not running, he usually says I\u2019m not running for governor now, as in right now. We are definitely keeping our options open, not committing one way or the other to anybody. He\u2019s being pushed by a lot of folks to run,\u201d said Matzen.\n\n( PHOTOS: Chris Christie's career)\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s Matzen\u2019s job to keep Booker\u2019s options open. Outside observers, citing the mayor\u2019s amicable relationship with the governor, still believe the odds are stacked against a Booker run.\n\nUnless Christie decides to forgo a second term.\n\nThat possibility, however slim, is a crucial part of Democrats\u2019 calculation as they sketch out a strategy for 2013.
