It 's criminality . Everybody knows it , '' he said as the crowd erupted in a sea of `` Lock her up ! '' chants .\n`` The amounts involved , the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a special prosecutor immediately , immediately , immediately , '' Trump said . `` After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes , they certainly can not be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton 's new crimes , which happen all the time . ''\nDuring an appearance on `` Jimmy Kimmel '' Monday night , Clinton brushed off any concerns about the release of additional emails after a federal judge Monday gave the State Department until next month to come up with a plan for making public thousands of emails that the FBI recovered as part of its probe into Clinton 's use a private email server .\n`` Jimmy , my emails are so boring , '' she said . `` And I 'm embarrassed about that . They 're so boring . So we 've already released , I do n't know , 30,000 plus , so what 's a few more ? ''\nTrump also encouraged his supporters to `` watch '' on Election Day , raising the specter of voter fraud : `` When I say 'watch , ' you know what I 'm talking about . '' Recently , Trump had warned that the November election could be `` rigged . ''\nTrump supporter Sen. Jeff Sessions suggested that the Democratic presidential candidate used her high position to `` extort '' from international governments for her family 's foundation .\n`` The fundamental thing is you can not be Secretary of State of the United States of America and use that position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation , '' he told CNN 's Alisyn Camerota on `` New Day '' Tuesday . `` That is a fundamental violation of law and that does appear to have happened . ''\nFor Trump , the controversies are a welcome opportunity to push the idea that Clinton is part of the Washington establishment and ca n't be trusted to shun special interests . A Washington Post/ABC News poll from earlier this month showed that 59 % of voters believe that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy . ( That same poll has that 62 % believe Trump is not trustworthy . )\nTrump bluntly argued that Clinton 's actions at the State Department amounted to corruption , even suggesting Clinton was at the center of a racketeering scheme .\n`` We are going to take government away from the special interests that give her tens of millions of dollars so that she can broadcast absolutely phony ads about me and we 're going to give it back to the voters , '' Trump vowed . `` Come November 8th , we are once again going to have a government that serves you and your family and your country , not the special interests , the donors and the lobbyists .
