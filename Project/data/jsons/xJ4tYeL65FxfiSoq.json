    "content": "The Mueller probe , with its indictments of Trump associates for offenses unrelated to its ostensible mandate , combined with mendacious media coverage of President Trump , is an obvious attempt to restore the old order that the electorate rejected in 2016 . It seeks to annul the will of the voters and return us to the incipient authoritarianism that germinated during the Obama era , and which the ruling class expected to blossom under Clinton . The bureaucrats who support the restoration of Beltway despotism call themselves public servants , yet despise the public .

Mueller and his apologists know Trump is the voice of a nationwide rebellion against their authority , and realize that the threat can \u2019 t be neutralized until he is silenced . The end game is to crush what they see as a peasant \u2019 s revolt . Mueller \u2019 s function is to provide a legal pretext for removing the President from office .
