Amid calls during the presidential campaign to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States , it feels like something has changed in the atmosphere , says Nadia , who asks that her last name not be used .\nAt a parent-teacher conference last week , a student , 8 or 9 years old , came up to her and said , \u201c When Donald Trump gets elected , you \u2019 re going to get deported , \u201d she says .\nThere was no question to her where the behavior came from , and on Tuesday night , it felt like voters sent her an inescapable message : That behavior was an acceptable part of the new America .\n\u201c We have these no-bullying initiatives , and then we are showing kids that bullies can win , \u201d Nadia says . \u201c I don \u2019 t know how we can reconcile that in the future . \u201d\nOn Wednesday night and again Thursday , shock , sadness , anger , and fear spilled across the nation in protests against the election of Mr. Trump .\nTens of thousands of demonstrators marched , lighted fires , and chanted anti-Trump slogans . The boldest and brashest talked of secession on social media . But for many , like Nadia , acceptance has come in waves of bitter disbelief .\nTo them , the election of Trump directly contradicts the values they cherish and associate with America . Interviews with women , people of color , immigrants , and members of the LGBTQ community across the country reveal deep-seated fears that Trump \u2019 s words and behavior have too often embodied what they have spent their lives opposing : racism , sexism , homophobia , and a white patriarchy that for centuries has shared its power only reluctantly .\nIn the wake of Tuesday \u2019 s election , these voters \u2013 particularly in liberal cities and states \u2013 are struggling to come to grips with a nation they say they hardly recognize . America \u2019 s promise to embrace all , before so bright , now seems perceptibly dimmer .\n\u201c There was a staggering amount of shock , \u201d says Raphael Sonenshein , executive director of the Edmund G. Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University Los Angeles . \u201c This was an extraordinarily intense campaign , and we \u2019 re seeing a lot of angst and concern , especially in communities that were talked about in a negative way . \u201d\nAs a woman of mixed black and Persian parentage , Shirin Shoai identified deeply with President Obama in both 2008 and 2012 . This year , she had connected as a woman with Hillary Clinton \u2013 and been appalled by Trump \u2019 s offhand remarks about sexual assault .\nOn Wednesday morning , she couldn \u2019 t believe what she saw when she woke up .\nThe notion that millions of her fellow citizens could support Trump was frightening for what it said about the depth of the divide within America , she says . As a psychotherapist in Berkeley , Calif. , her job is to forge connections between people . She wonders now if the nation is capable of it .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s going to take a lot of work to get us together as a country , \u201d Ms. Shoai says . \u201c It requires a kind of empathy and availability to that other person that I don \u2019 t know on a national scale that we have . \u201d\nFor Jessie Earl , the concern stems from the discrimination she has faced as a transgender woman . In many ways , she has been fortunate , she says . Even in the small , conservative town in New York State where she grew up , she was often surrounded by supportive friends and family . Still , the sting of bigotry is familiar .\nLast week , she went into a bathroom in a building close to the Los Angeles office where she works as a digital editor . A woman , upon seeing her , said loudly that it seemed a man had made his way into the ladies \u2019 room . A supervisor was called in , who defused the situation , Ms. Earl says .\n\u201c But that was terrifying to me , \u201d she says . \u201c I wanted to hide . \u201d\nEarl worries that Trump , through his words and actions , would legitimize that sort of discrimination .\n\u201c It \u2019 ll tell people that that behavior is acceptable , \u201d she says . And while she lives in Southern California , where such incidents are less likely to take place , she knows that others are not so fortunate .\n\u201c I have friends in North Carolina who are transgender , \u201d she says . \u201c I don \u2019 t want them to live in a society that says it \u2019 s OK to ostracize them . \u201d\nAmong immigrants and the Hispanic community , the fear of what a Trump administration might mean is perhaps even more palpable .\nTwo years ago , US-born Paola Hernandez married Emmanuel Ramirez , and now the Tucson , Ariz. , couple has an 18-month-old daughter .
