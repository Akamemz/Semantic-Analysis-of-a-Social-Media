    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nOn Tuesday night, the House and Senate Budget Committees reached a bipartisan budget deal. Congress hasn\u2019t passed a budget in five years, but this new deal is hardly good news. The Ryan-Murray budget deal increases spending on domestic programs by $45 billion in 2014 and $18 billion in 2015, totaling $63 billion over the next two years. It blows through the caps set by the Budget Control Act while promising spending reductions down the road over the next 10 years.\n\nPersonally, I am wary of accepting a spending increase now for deficit reductions we may not see until 2024, if at all. How can leadership credibly promise spending cuts later, after agreeing to a plan that rolls back the sequestration savings promised two debt increases ago? There\u2019s a predictable pattern here, and it always leaves citizens footing the bill.\n\nRepublican leadership argues that conservatives should keep calm because these new spending increases will be offset by fees, including $12.6 billion in higher security fees for airline passengers. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, announced he is \u201cproud\u201d of the deal, saying it reduces the deficit without raising taxes and imposes smart spending cuts that avert the indiscriminate approach of the sequestration.\n\nYou\u2019ll be paying more for an airplane ticket, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s not a tax. No matter what they call it, the fact remains that government is planning to take more money from you to cover their unsustainable spending habits.\n\nRather than standing on principle when it counts, Republican leadership has once again sided with the Democrats to increase spending and taxes for short-term political relief, leaving \u201cwe the people\u201d to foot the bill.\n\nTo add insult to injury, House Speaker John A. Boehner directed his fire away from the big spenders and toward fiscally conservative groups who are actually committed to reducing the debt. In his news conference Wednesday morning, Mr. Boehner lashed out at conservative grass-roots organizations such as FreedomWorks, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re using our members, and they\u2019re using the American people, for their own goals,\u201d calling opposition to the deal \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\nMr. Boehner\u2019s real problem here isn\u2019t with conservative groups like FreedomWorks \u2014 it\u2019s with millions of individual Americans who vote Republican because they were told the GOP was the party of small government and fiscal responsibility.\n\nAfter two years of failed negotiations and failed supercommittees, Republicans have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory once again by surrendering the sequestration, the backup plan to their original budgetary-negotiation backup plan.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, hailed the deal, saying it shows \u201cwe can do something without another crisis lurking around the corner.\u201d\n\nWhile deal-making for the sake of deal-making isn\u2019t a particularly compelling argument for grass-roots conservatives, Mrs. Murray was right about one thing: We have to stop making policy decisions on a crisis-by-crisis basis.\n\nThe root of America\u2019s spending problem is the failure of Congress to pass a real budget for five years.
