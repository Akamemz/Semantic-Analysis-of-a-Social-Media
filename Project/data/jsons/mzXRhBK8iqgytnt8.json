Stocks were mixed in early trading Wednesday but came off lows when a memo of Trump 's conversation with Ukraine 's president did not show that Trump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine .\nOn Tuesday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would investigate impeaching Trump for seeking help from the president of the Ukraine in gathering dirt on Democratic presidential candidate , Joe Biden and his son .\nStocks so far are shrugging off risks that President Donald Trump could be impeached , but investors may be betting that if he is , the market will ultimately rally , the way it did in the Clinton era .\nSemiconductors , which have been tied to China trade , moved higher , and the SMH VanEck Vecotrs Semiconductor ETF was up about 1.1 % .
