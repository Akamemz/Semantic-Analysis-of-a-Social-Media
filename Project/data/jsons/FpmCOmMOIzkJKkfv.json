Some thoughts :\n( 1 ) At the risk of being accused of homerism ( disclosure : I 'm a Fox News contributor ) , Chris Wallace was superb in his moderating duties last night . He eschewed the temptation to come barging out of the gate with questions about salacious news cycle-driven dramas , opting to save `` fitness to be president '' themes for much later in the evening . He led with issues . This was a debate that primarily focused on issues . The Fox News Sunday host held each candidate to account for the proposals they 've put forward , and the things they 've said . He pressed Trump for specifics . He challenged Clinton with honed evidence . He was tough on both of them , directed the ( sometimes wild ) rhetorical traffic with laudable poise , and afforded the candidates a fairly wide berth to engage each other , but without allowing the exchanges to spin out of control .
