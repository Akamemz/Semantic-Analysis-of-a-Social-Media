From the FBI 's website :\nThe National Instant Criminal Background Check System , or NICS , is all about saving lives and protecting people from harm -- by not letting guns and explosives fall into the wrong hands .

[ Cam & Company , 1/3/13 ]\nFACT : Private Sales Without A Background Check Are Extremely Common , Including At Gun Shows And Online\nLaw Center To Prevent Gun Violence : Private Sales Loophole Has Been Exploited By Gun Traffickers And Used To Supply Firearms To Criminals . The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence explained how a deficiency in federal law concerning how firearms sellers are licensed allows dangerous individuals to obtain firearms without a background check :\nThe Gun Control Act of 1968 provides that persons \u201c engaged in the business \u201d of dealing in firearms must be licensed . Although Congress did not originally define the term \u201c engaged in the business , \u201d it did so in 1986 as part of the McClure-Volkmer Act ( also known as the \u201c Firearms Owners ' Protection Act \u201d ) . That Act defined the term \u201c engaged in the business , \u201d as applied to a firearms dealer , as \u201c a person who devotes time , attention , and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. \u201d Significantly , however , the term was defined to exclude a person who \u201c makes occasional sales , exchanges , or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby , or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. \u201d Consequently , unlicensed sellers may sell firearms without conducting background checks or documenting the transaction in any way . In addition , because federal law does not require private sellers to inspect a buyer 's driver 's license or any other identification , there is no obligation for such sellers to confirm that a buyer is of legal age to purchase a firearm . As a result , convicted felons , minors and other prohibited purchasers can easily buy guns from unlicensed sellers . According to a 1999 report issued by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) , the current definition of \u201c engaged in the business \u201d often frustrates the prosecution of \u201c unlicensed dealers masquerading as collectors or hobbyists but who are really trafficking firearms to felons or other prohibited persons. \u201d A June 2000 ATF report found that unlicensed sellers were involved in about a fifth of the trafficking investigations and associated with nearly 23,000 diverted guns . A national survey of firearm ownership conducted in 1994 determined that 60 percent of all firearm sales in the U.S. involved federally licensed dealers , while the remaining 40 percent of firearms were acquired from unlicensed sellers .
