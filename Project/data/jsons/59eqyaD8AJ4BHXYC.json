    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security is set to conduct a series of massive deportation raids across the country starting in January . They \u2019 ll mostly be targeting families reportedly fleeing the rising violence in Central America that have crossed the border within the past year and have been ordered to leave by an immigration judge , according to the Washington Post :\nThe nationwide campaign , to be carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents as soon as early January , would be the first large-scale effort to deport families who have fled violence in Central America , those familiar with the plan said . More than 100,000 families with both adults and children have made the journey across the southwest border since last year , though this migration has largely been overshadowed by a related surge of unaccompanied minors . The ICE operation would target only adults and children who have already been ordered removed from the United States by an immigration judge , according to officials familiar with the undertaking , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because planning is ongoing and the operation has not been given final approval by DHS . The adults and children would be detained wherever they can be found and immediately deported . The number targeted is expected to be in the hundreds and possibly greater . The proposed deportations have been controversial inside the Obama administration , which has been discussing them for several months . DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has been pushing for the moves , according to those with knowledge of the debate , in part because of a new spike in the number of illegal immigrants in recent months . [ \u2026 ] Marsha Catron , a DHS spokeswoman , would not comment on any possible ICE operations but pointed out that Johnson \u201c has consistently said our border is not open to illegal immigration , and if individuals come here illegally , do not qualify for asylum or other relief , and have final orders of removal , they will be sent back consistent with our laws and our values. \u201d [ \u2026 ] Johnson has also made clear that families , children and others who had illegally crossed the border recently and did not obtain asylum status \u2014 and anyone ordered deported starting on Jan. 1 , 2014 \u2014 would be subject to removal .\nThe publication added that there would possibly be a backlash from Latino and immigration groups over this measure .
