Take that !\nFor the past couple of weeks , Senate Republicans have not been granting unanimous consent to shorten debate periods and bring various nominations to the floor , slowing the chamber 's schedule by using up all of the allotted debate time on each nomination . That 's continuing now with the 10 or so remaining nominations on the calendar year . ( Unless Democrats and Republicans can agree to some sort of deal -- ha ha -- unconfirmed nominees would have to be renominated in the new year . ) Reid seems to have settled on getting through four of the nominations before adjourning for the year , and getting everyone out of town sometime mid to late weekend after working around the clock for the next couple of days .\nNow word is coming in that Democrats ' friends across the aisle may not even stick around for this weekend 's # senateparty .

From the Hill :\nSenate GOP Whip John Cornyn ( Texas ) said it is up to individual senators if they want to stick around Congress on Friday and Saturday to vote on nominees Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) has put on the schedule .
