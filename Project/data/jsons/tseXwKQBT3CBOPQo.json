King : Information is `` specific , '' attacks `` really could be almost anyplace ''\nWestern targets , not just American ones , are under threat , officials say\nA global travel alert issued Friday by the State Department warned al Qaeda may launch attacks in the Middle East , North Africa and beyond in coming weeks , a threat that prompted Sunday 's closure of 21 embassies and consulates .\nThe U.S. government 's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East as well as North Africa , said U.S. officials who spoke to CNN on condition of not being identified .\n`` The threat appears to be much worse than it has ( been ) in a long time , '' said a senior national security official in Yemen , where the government is `` on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come . ''\nVarious Western targets -- not just those tied to the United States -- are under threat , according to two U.S. officials .\nAccording to three sources , the United States has information that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula members are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack .\nOne of the sources said that such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . In particular , Sunday is Laylet al-Qadr , or the Night of Power , which is one of the holiest moments on the Muslim calendar .\nSaid one U.S. official : `` It all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future . ''\nBased on intelligence , U.S. officials said , there was particular concern about the U.S. Embassy in Yemen between Saturday and Tuesday . President Barack Obama -- who , amid regular updates on the situation , has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect Americans -- praised Yemeni President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi for his country 's efforts following a meeting Thursday at the White House .\nStill , it 's unclear whether the apparent plot targets that Arabian nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly , and why embassies from Bangladesh to Libya are being closed . The expected time of an attack also is n't known , with the U.S. travel alert noting the threat extends through the end of August .\n`` Terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests , '' the alert states . `` U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure . ''\nNew York Rep. Peter King , a member of the House Intelligence Committee , called the information `` the most specific I 've seen . ''\nWhile the principal attention is on the Arabian Peninsula , he stressed to CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that '' we ca n't rule anything out . ''\n`` We are focused on the Middle East , but it 's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace , '' said King .\nThe State Department made public Friday a list of 21 embassies and consulates that will close Sunday , which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected .\nThe 17 affected U.S. embassies are in Afghanistan , Algeria , Bahrain , Bangladesh , Djibouti , Egypt , Iraq , Jordan , Kuwait , Libya , Mauritania , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Sudan and Yemen . The U.S. embassy in Israel will be closed as normal Sunday .\nConsulates in Iraq , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also being shut down for the day .

The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially thought the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video, made in the United States, that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But the storming of the mission was later determined to have been a terrorist attack.
