The legislation would require doctors to provide ordinary medical care to infants who are born alive after an attempted abortion.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) reintroduced this legislation in January 2019, after Virginia governor Ralph Northam suggested that mothers and physicians may determine whether nearly aborted newborns should be left to die from lack of care, at least in some circumstances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast February, 44 Democratic senators tacitly agreed with Northam, voting to block the born-alive bill and its requirement that newborns be afforded \u201cthe same degree\u201d of care that \u201cany other child born alive at the same gestational age\u201d would receive.\n\nThe Democrats have presented flimsy rationales for their opposition.\n\nThey claim, first, that \u201cborn-alive\u201d infants don\u2019t exist, that attempted abortions never produce living infants. This is not the case, as we know from the woeful tale of abortionist Kermit Gosnell, whose murderous crimes against newborns were not illegal under federal law. Though data on born-alive infants are spotty, there is both anecdotal and reported evidence that infants do survive late-term abortion procedures with some regularity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen proven wrong on this first point, Democrats pivot to the assertion that laws already exist to prevent infanticide. In the context of abortion, that is false. There is no federal law requiring doctors to provide life-saving care to infants who survive abortions. Only 33 states, at last count, have such laws in place.
