Big Dem donors : To 2020 and beyond\nDemocratic operatives , worried that election night could be a major disappointment , are preparing a damage control offensive meant to convince the rich liberals who opened their wallets wide in 2014 that their money wasn \u2019 t spent in vain .\nEfforts are being made to temper donors \u2019 expectations by reminding them that oddsmakers had been predicting a Republican wave , while emphasizing the potential long-term impact of sustained big spending to promote liberal candidates and ideas .\nThe goal is to avoid a big money drop-off from rich Democrats who had initially been reluctant to embrace super PACs but who came off the sidelines in a substantial way for the first time in 2014 . The plan is to quickly shift their focus to 2016 , when Democrats face a much more hospitable Senate map and a potentially historic presidential campaign .\nThe influential Democracy Alliance club of wealthy liberal donors is convening a closed-door conference beginning Nov. 12 called \u201c To 2020 and Beyond : Our Progressive Vision. \u201d Meanwhile , major donors and operatives supporting Hillary Clinton \u2019 s prospective presidential campaign are planning to urge her to announce her intentions in the coming weeks to re-energize major donors behind her candidacy or , if she passes on the race , allow them to rally behind another candidate .\n\u201c If Hillary is going to run , it would be best to do it quickly post-election , \u201d said Houston trial lawyer Steve Mostyn , a Democracy Alliance member who is on the national finance council of a super PAC paving the way for a Clinton run . \u201c Any midterm election hangover \u2026 would resolve quickly . \u201d\nMostyn , along with his wife , Amber , and their law firm , donated more than $ 2 million to Democratic politicians and committees in 2014 .
