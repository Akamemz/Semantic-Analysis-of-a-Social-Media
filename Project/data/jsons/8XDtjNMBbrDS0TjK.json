This President is focused on action and I 'm a little dismayed that I did n't receive one question on the deaths that we got in this country this weekend. \u201d She wasn \u2019 t asked \u201c about New York City shootings doubling for the third straight week , and over the last seven days shooting skyrocket [ sic ] by 142 percent. \u201d Reporters groaned and protested .\nFor analysis of this tactic , Farhi turned to Ryan Lizza , the chief Washington correspondent for Politico .

Is there a number ? \u201d\nRecently , Lizza asked her , facetiously : \u201c Does President Trump believe that it was a good thing that the South lost the Civil War ? \u201d\nLizza \u2019 s live-in girlfriend , Olivia Nuzzi of New York magazine , beat him to the sleazy punch when she asked Trump on April 27 : \u201c If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War , does he deserve to be re-elected ? \u201d\nThis kind of question is performance art . It \u2019 s a look-at-me spectacle , a Jim Acosta bump-and-grind .
