Fox News reported Thursday that the information is so sensitive that even senators , who already have clearance , must go through additional hoops if they want to see some of what she was sending .\nThe Clinton campaign responded by accusing the inspector general , I. Charles McCullough , appointed by President Obama , of politically motivated leaks to sabotage her campaign .\nBut she is suffering from the slow drip of the email scandal . Surveys show voters see her chief primary challenger , Sen. Bernard Sanders , as much more honest and trustworthy .\n\u201c Trustworthiness is not a problem by itself for Clinton , but combined with other past and present scandals weighing her down , alternative candidates like Sanders begin to look more appealing , \u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus , a political science professor at the University of Houston who specializes in political leadership . \u201c For a candidate with enough negative stories and rumors about them as Hillary Clinton , her campaign can refute individual charges to win a daily news battle but lose the larger perception war . \u201d\nThere is ample evidence that the war already has been lost .\nA recent Quinnipiac University Poll found that 93 percent of Democratic primary voters consider Mr. Sanders honest and trustworthy , while just 66 percent said the same of Mrs. Clinton .\nA CNN survey conducted this month found that 55 percent of Democratic voters consider Mrs. Clinton to be the \u201c least honest \u201d candidate in the race .\nAgainst that backdrop , reports surfaced this week that Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s private email server contained several dozen more classified emails than previously thought , including some from \u201c special access programs , \u201d or SAP .\nEven top members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations are unable to view such messages without additional security steps , including signing new nondisclosure agreements , Fox News reported .\n\u201c These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined to be at the confidential , secret and top secret/sap levels , \u201d Mr. McCullough said in a letter to lawmakers obtained by The Associated Press .\nMrs. Clinton pushed back against the reports in an interview with NPR Wednesday , sticking to the story that she never knowingly sent or received classified email on her private server , which was housed outside the formal State.gov domain .\n\u201c As the State Department has confirmed , I never sent or received any material marked classified , and that hasn \u2019 t changed in all of these months , \u201d she said , blaming congressional Republicans for the continued focus on her emails . \u201c This seems to me to be , you know , another effort to inject this into the campaign .

Most have been released , with the last of them expected on Jan. 29 \u2014 just days before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1 .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s use of private email has dogged her since it was first revealed publicly in March 2015 . She began returning her emails to the State Department after the Obama administration , prodded by a House investigation into the Benghazi affair , discovered Mrs. Clinton had taken all of her messages with her when she left the State Department at the end of Mr. Obama \u2019 s first term .\nThe administration then said that Mrs. Clinton had refused to use a regular email account on the State.gov email server and instead used a private server that she kept in her home in New York .\nMrs. Clinton has since said she regrets using the private server , but has steadfastly maintained that she did not use the private account to send or receive classified information .\nInvestigations also have found that the State Department routinely has botched open records requests for Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s emails .
