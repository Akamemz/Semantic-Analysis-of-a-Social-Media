    "content": "Joe Biden speaks to members of the press at Iowa Wesleyan University in Mount Pleasant , Iowa , June 11 , 2019 . ( Jordan Gale/Reuters )\nHis rivals , beginning with Cory Booker and Bill de Blasio , have already started to pounce .\nBy any standard , Joe Biden is the Democratic presidential front-runner . The poll averages at RealClearPolitics , for example , show Biden with a commanding 32\u201315 lead over Bernie Sanders in national polls and leading Sanders by 27 percentage points in South Carolina , 13 in New Hampshire , 13 in Nevada , and six in Iowa . FiveThirtyEight shows Biden leading Kamala Harris in the race for endorsements . The bedrock of Biden \u2019 s support is African-American voters , among whom he led Sanders 50\u201310 in mid June in a national Economist/YouGov poll , and 50\u201313 in an early-June battleground-state CBS/YouGov poll , and led Elizabeth Warren 52\u201314 in a mid June Charleston Post and Courier poll of South Carolina . Most national polls show a similar picture .\nThere are obvious reasons that Democrats in general and black voters in particular are , for now , with the 76-year-old Biden . He carries a lot of good will from being Barack Obama \u2019 s devoted vice president ; relations between the two were visibly warm . Biden \u2019 s name recognition and establishment support go a long way , too . For Democratic partisans focused mainly on beating Donald Trump , much can be forgiven of a guy who was on two winning national tickets and is seen as the \u201c electable \u201d candidate who can reach moderates and blue-collar white Midwesterners .\nBut in a political culture increasingly focused on past sins against racial and gender equality , Biden has long been sitting on a time bomb : his many enduring friendships and alliances with segregationist Dixiecrats . And by \u201c segregationist , \u201d I don \u2019 t mean \u201c not totally on board with the progressive agenda circa 2019 \u201d ; I mean the real-deal : signers of the pro\u2013Jim Crow Southern Manifesto , \u201c massive-resistance \u201d bitter-enders , raisers of the Confederate flag on public property , you name it . The Senate Democratic caucus Joe Biden joined in 1973 was headed by a former Klansman , with notorious segregationists running virtually all the major committees . These men became Biden \u2019 s mentors and friends , and he had nothing but glowing words for them his whole career .\nTuesday night , at a fundraiser in New York , Biden lit the fuse on that bomb . In his report on the event , Jack Crowe writes at NRO that Biden\nwent on to praise Democratic senators James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia , both of whom steadfastly opposed racial integration and federal civil-rights protections for African Americans . \u201c I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland , \u201d Mr. Biden said , slipping briefly into a Southern accent , according to the pool report . \u201c He never called me \u2018 boy , \u2019 he always called me \u2018 son. \u2019 \u201d \u201c Well guess what ? \u201d he continued . \u201c At least there was some civility . We got things done . We didn \u2019 t agree on much of anything . We got things done . We got it finished . But today you look at the other side and you \u2019 re the enemy . Not the opposition , the enemy . We don \u2019 t talk to each other anymore . \u201d\nThis is far from an isolated incident . In 2017 , at an Alabama rally for Doug Jones , Biden elaborated :\nI \u2019 ve been around so long , I worked with James Eastland . . . . Even in the days when I got there , the Democratic party still had seven or eight old-fashioned Democratic segregationists . You \u2019 d get up and you \u2019 d argue like the devil with them . Then you \u2019 d go down and have lunch or dinner together . The political system worked . We were divided on issues , but the political system worked .\nWhen Biden faced a reelection in 1978 , Eastland even offered to help Biden \u2019 s Senate campaign . \u201c I looked at Eastland . He said , \u2018 What can old Jim Eastland do for you in Delaware ? \u2019 \u201d Biden recounted at a 2016 Labor Day event in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . \u201c I said , \u2018 Mr . Chairman , some places you \u2019 d help and some places you \u2019 d hurt. \u2019 He said , \u2018 Well , I \u2019 ll come to Delaware and campaign for you or against you , whichever will help the most . \u2019 \u201d\nAs Katie Glueck in the New York Times notes , Eastland and Talmadge were totally unreconstructed defenders of Jim Crow and unabashed defenders of white supremacy ; Eastland maintained to the end that he had no regrets :\nMr. Eastland , a plantation owner , was known as a vociferous opponent of integration efforts and a staunch critic of the civil rights movement , which he sometimes dismissed as the work of \u201c Communists. \u201d Throughout his career he referred to African Americans as members of an \u201c inferior race \u201d and used the racist term \u201c mongrelization. \u201d Mr. Talmadge was also a critic of the civil-rights movement and opposed the 1954 Supreme Court decision , Brown v. Board of Education , that declared racially segregated public schools unconstitutional .\nTalmadge \u2019 s response to the Brown decision : \u201c There aren \u2019 t enough troops in the whole United States to make the white people of this state send their children to school with colored children. \u201d ( You can watch Talmadge in his own words here . )\nBiden in the mid 1970s worked with both Eastland and Jesse Helms to fight busing , even writing to Eastland \u201c to thank you again for your efforts in support of my bill to limit court ordered busing \u201d and to invite the old segregationist to speak in favor of Biden \u2019 s proposal . Helms , for his part , was long a b\u00eate noire of liberals ; Biden bragged of his friendship with Helms and his wife .\nIn April , Biden gave a glowing eulogy at the funeral of his longtime friend Ernest \u201c Fritz \u201d Hollings , with whom he served in the Senate until 2005 ; it was Hollings , a vocal supporter of segregation for his first decade and a half in office , who raised the Confederate battle flag over the South Carolina capitol in 1961 . In 1955 , Hollings described the NAACP as \u201c against our way of life in the South \u201d and snarled , \u201c If the U.S. Supreme Court can declare certain organizations as subversive , I believe South Carolina can declare the NAACP both subversive and illegal . \u201d\nBiden had also spoken at the funeral of Strom Thurmond , the 1948 Dixiecrat candidate for president who later joined the Republican party ; in 2002 , Trent Lott was ousted as Republican Senate majority leader for praising Thurmond . ( In the mid \u2019 80s , Biden worked with Thurmond to force the Reagan administration to appoint a \u201c drug czar. \u201d ) In 1997 , praising his colleague on the occasion of becoming the longest-serving senator , Biden described Thurmond as \u201c the consummate public servant , \u201d waxed eloquent about \u201c his strength of character , his absolute honesty and integrity , his strong sense of fairness , and his commitment to public service \u201d and added that he was \u201c an absolute gentleman , unfailingly courteous and respectful of each individual \u2019 s dignity . Throughout a lifetime spent in the political arena , he has never forgotten that those who disagree with us are nonetheless entitled to being heard out and treated with dignity . \u201d\nIn 1988 , Biden praised Mississippi Senator John Stennis , another signatory of the Southern Manifesto , as \u201c a man of character and courage \u201d and gushed that to receive praise from Stennis was \u201c beyond any expectation that I ever had in my wildest dreams \u201d :\nThen there \u2019 s Robert Byrd , the former Ku Klux Klan Exalted Cyclops who served in the Democratic Senate caucus until his death in 2010 . Byrd , the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate from 1971 to 1976 and the Democratic leader from 1977 to 1988 , wrote as a young man in 1945 to segregationist Mississippi senator Theodore Bilbo that Byrd would never fight in the armed forces \u201c with a Negro by my side. \u201d \u201c Rather I should die a thousand times , and see old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again , than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels. \u201d Biden eulogized Byrd , too , as \u201c a dear friend . . . a mentor . . . and a guide \u201d whom he \u201c revere [ d ] \u201d and also as the \u201c most fierce defender of not only the state , but the way of life \u201d of West Virginia .\nIn 1975 , Biden supported a resolution by Harry Byrd \u2014 son of the longtime head of the Democratic machine in Jim Crow-era Virginia , and himself an independent senator because of his Dixiecrat leanings \u2014 to restore the citizenship of Robert E. Lee .\nNor was this sort of thing limited to his fellow Senators . In 1975 , Biden argued that \u201c the Democratic Party could stand a liberal George Wallace \u2014 someone who \u2019 s not afraid to stand up and offend people , someone who wouldn \u2019 t pander but would say what the American people know in their gut is right. \u201d Wallace , who was then gearing up to run for president again in 1976 , was known for his breakaway Dixiecrat campaign in 1968 and his mantra of \u201c Segregation now , segregation forever ! \u201d Wallace would serve as the Democratic governor of Alabama until 1987 . That year , during Biden \u2019 s first campaign for president , the Detroit Free Press noted that \u201c campaigning in Alabama last April , Biden talked of his sympathy for the South , bragged of an award he had received from George Wallace in 1973 , and said \u2018 we ( Delawareans ) were on the South \u2019 s side in the Civil War. \u2019 \u201d Biden had bragged that Wallace described Biden as \u201c one of the outstanding young politicians of America . \u201d\nBiden can , of course , offer excuses : Some of his old Dixiecrat friends repented ; some became Republicans ; some were run out of office by liberal challengers . A man ought to say nice things in a eulogy for a friend or a tribute to a retiring colleague , especially those who had showed Biden personal kindness after the death of his wife and daughter in a car accident in late 1972 . Then again , some of the men he praised retired unrepentant , and some remained members of the Senate Democratic caucus in good standing well into the 21st century . None of Biden \u2019 s excuses would be considered acceptable if he was a Republican like Lott . Biden \u2019 s rivals , beginning with Cory Booker and Bill de Blasio , have already started to pounce ; Booker thundered that \u201c You don \u2019 t joke about calling black men \u2018 boys. \u2019 \u2026Vice President Biden \u2019 s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people , and for everyone. \u201d De Blasio added , \u201c Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal & that whites were entitled to \u2018 the pursuit of dead n * ggers . \u2019 \u201d\nWith the first Democratic debates beginning next week , we may see soon enough if further criticism is enough to make African-American voters rethink their support for Joe Biden . If it isn \u2019 t , this could be a very short primary campaign .",
