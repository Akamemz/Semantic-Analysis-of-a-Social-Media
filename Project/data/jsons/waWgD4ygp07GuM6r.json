Upcoming special elections to fill the vacancies in Alabama and Massachusetts will almost give one seat to each party.Democratic strategists frequently speak of `` the magic 17 '' \u2014the number of districts carried by President Barack Obama in 2012 in which voters also sent a Republican to the House . Victories in all 17 districts by Democratic candidates would mean a recapture of the Democratic majority in the House , with 218 seats to 217 for the Republicans.In a memo marked `` Please Do Not Share This List With the Press '' but obtained last week by Roll Call , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee named the 17 Republican-held seats it is targeting . Among them were such narrow 2012 winners as Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado , Lee Terry of Nebraska , and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.But this strategy depends on Democrats winning everything they target and Republicans picking up nothing . That means , as House editor David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report said , `` There 's basically no margin of error for House Democrats . `` On the other hand , Republicans will almost surely be targeting the nine districts that went for Mitt Romney for president but sent a Democrat to the House.These include the two closest races in the nation last year : North Carolina 's 7th District and Arizona 's 2nd , in which Republicans David Rouzer and Martha McSally will square off in rematches with Democratic Reps. Mike McIntyre and Ron Barbe , respectively.Widely considered the most vulnerable Democratic-held district in the nation is Florida 's 18th District , where 30-year-old Democrat Patrick Murphy edged out swashbuckling conservative Allen West , by less than 2,000 votes . Already four Republicans have filed for the chance to oppose Murphy in 2014.Even though Murphy has voted `` the right way '' in conservative eyes by supporting delays in the Obamacare mandate for both businesses and individuals , his vote against repeal of Obamacare is expected to be a major issue for any Republican opponent.Although that Republican primary is likely to grow more crowded because of the perceived vulnerability of the incumbent , the early favorite is Carl Domino , former assistant state house GOP leader , successful investments adviser , and U.S. Navy veteran.For open seats , there always is greater competition and more `` switcheroos '' than attempting to dislodge incumbents . So far , there are 14 seats without incumbents \u2014 five Democratic-held seats and nine Republican-held seats.The West Virginia seat that Republican Shelley Moore Capito is leaving , to run for the Senate , could go Democratic , and the Iowa seat Democrat Bruce Braley is giving up for a Senate run could go the other way . For now , few of the other 12 are likely to flip.Former Secretary of State James Baker once said `` overnight is an eternity in politics . '' Much can change between now and November of 2014 .
