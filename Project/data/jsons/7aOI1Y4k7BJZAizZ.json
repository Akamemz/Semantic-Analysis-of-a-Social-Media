In the final two weeks , there were closer to seven negative pieces about Clinton for every two positive pieces , according to the report from Harvard \u2019 s Shorenstein Center on Media , Politics , and Public Policy .\nOf course , part of that change was driven by new facts on the ground \u2014 like the revelations about the FBI \u2019 s decision to briefly reopen an investigation into Clinton \u2019 s private email server , and the WikiLeaks disclosures \u2014 that Donald Trump voters may regard as legitimate reasons for more negative stories .\nBut whatever the cause , according to the Harvard report , talk of Clinton \u2019 s alleged scandals hit their peak right before Election Day .\nMeanwhile , the tenor of coverage for Trump moved in the opposite direction in the home stretch . Whereas the blizzard of negative Trump stories was worst for him around the time of the debates and the release of the \u201c grab \u2019 em by the pussy \u201d tape , the media softened on the Republican nominee in the final days of the campaign .\nOnly 65 percent of stories about Trump were negative in that final week , while a full 35 percent were positive , the report found . Both numbers were the best press he \u2019 d gotten since at least before August :\nBefore Clinton loyalists rush to deride the media over this study , an important caveat : The criteria for \u201c negative \u201d coverage includes stories about the state of the horse race . And around the time Clinton coverage went negative , the polls really were narrowing , at least somewhat , between the candidates .\nIn other words , a story saying Trump was moving up in the polls \u2014 which nobody would consider \u201c unfair \u201d \u2014 would be considered \u201c positive \u201d coverage in this study , and a story saying Clinton was losing ground would be considered \u201c negative. \u201d So part of what \u2019 s going on here doesn \u2019 t necessarily reflect a disproportionate media pile-on over Clinton \u2019 s controversies .
