The discovery raises new questions about whether pets can contract the virus , and if it is contagious from pets ( or zoo animals ) to humans .\nNadia , a four-year-old Malayan tiger who lives at the Bronx Zoo , was suffering from a dry cough and loss of appetite , which prompted the test for novel coronavirus . Nadia 's symptoms were first noticed on March 27 , and zoo officials decided to test her `` out of an abundance of caution , '' according to a statement from the Wildlife Conservation Society .\nFortunately , Nadia is expected to recover , but it is likely she is n't the only zoo animal infected . While tests have yet to confirm positive coronavirus results , other cats at the zoo \u2014 including Nadia 's sister Azul , two Amur tigers and three African lions \u2014 developed dry coughs as well . The zoo believes that a caretaker with novel coronavirus infected the cats before developing any symptoms .\n`` Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite , the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright , alert , and interactive with their keepers , '' the statement read . `` It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats , since different species can react differently to novel infections , but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries . ''\nThis is the first known coronavirus infection of an animal in the United States , and in a tiger anywhere around the world . As the zoo emphasized on Twitter , the test used for Nadia is not the same test used for humans . The results were confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture 's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa .\nStill , pets have tested positive for the coronavirus , albeit on other continents . As questions abound over human-to-animal transmission , here 's what we know so far .\nAccording to new research by scientists at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute , in China , five domestic cats were intentionally exposed to high doses of the novel coronavirus , known scientifically as SARS-CoV-2 . In the experiment \u2014 whose results were posted on bioRxiv , but have to be peer reviewed \u2014 two of the cats that were euthanized had viral RNA in their upper respiratory tracts . The remaining three cats were placed in cages next to three uninfected felines . Later , researchers detected viral RNA in one of the exposed cats , which suggests that it got infected from a droplet from one of the three infected cats . More tests are needed to scientifically conclude cat-to-cat transmission .\nIntriguingly , despite being infected , none of the infected house cats showed symptoms of illness .\nA separate study of feral cats in Wuhan , which is also not yet peer reviewed , showed that some had antibodies to the coronavirus , suggesting that they did have some level of exposure to the coronavirus . The cats were n't ill while tested .\nAccording to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) : `` We are still learning about this virus , but we know that it is zoonotic and it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations . ''\nIf you are sick with SARS-CoV-2 , or suspect you have it , the CDC recommends treating a pet like a human in your household ( regardless of species ) and keeping social distance .\n`` Although there have been no reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States , it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus , '' the CDC states .\nThere is no evidence that suggests humans are getting the coronavirus from cats , or any pets . The CDC asserts :\n`` The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mostly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing , sneezing , and talking . Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19 . At this time , there is no evidence that companion animals , including pets , can spread COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection in the United States . ''\nSeveral health officials have reiterated this . Karen Terio , head of the Zoological Pathology Program at the University of Illinois veterinary school ( where tests for the Bronx Zoo tiger were conducted ) told the New York Times : `` Given the number of people in this country that have been infected with the virus and have become ill , and the number of people in this country that own domestic cats , it seems fairly improbable that cats are an important source of the virus for people if the first case we 're diagnosing it in is a tiger . ''\nIn 2012 , it was estimated that there were 74.1 million pet cats in America .\nAccording to the same study of the cats from the researchers at Harbin Veterinary Research Institute , dogs are not really susceptible to the infection . Chickens , pigs and ducks are not likely to get infected , either . Similar to the way the researchers studied cats , five 3-month beagles were administered high doses of the coronavirus , and housed with two beagles who were n't exposed . Swabs were collected from the animals every two days for the next two weeks . Researchers detected viral RNA on the second and sixth days in a couple dogs who were inoculated in their feces , but none of the dogs contained the infectious virus . `` These results indicate that dogs have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 , '' the researchers concluded . The researchers also investigated the susceptibility of pigs , chickens , and ducks , and concluded they are n't likely to get infected , like dogs .\nIn Hong Kong , two dogs tested positive for COVID-19 . The first one , who was 17 years old , died after having a `` weak positive '' test result , according to South Morning China Post . `` It is very likely that the two positive cases [ in Hong Kong ] are examples of human-to-dog transmission , '' Malik Peiris , a leading public health virologist at the University of Hong Kong , told the South Morning China Post .\nFerrets , on the other hand , have a similar susceptibility as cats .\nAgain , there 's no evidence right now to suggest that if you pet a dog that has been sneezed on by an infected person , you 'll get infected yourself . While you should always wash your hands before and after petting an animal , and ask the owner for permission to pet while practicing social distancing , experts are n't as worried about this as being a source of transmission . The American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) Chief Veterinary Officer Gail Golab told the Washington Post : `` We 're not overly concerned about people contracting COVID-19 through contact with dogs and cats .
