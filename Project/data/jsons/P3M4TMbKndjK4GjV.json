These two gentlemen are , along with Chris Cillizza and Politico , responsible for reducing political coverage to its current , frightfully superficial state . For these folks , it \u2019 s of great importance who \u201d won the morning \u201d and who had the worst week in Washington . And , of course , no matter what mishap befalls any politician , it will be good news for John McCain\u2014a head-scratcher that is , for some reason , considered gospel .\nHeilemann and Halperin have been given $ 1 million apiece to found and run a politics site . It \u2019 s not a surprise ; Bloomberg News long ago expanded its editorial portfolio , jettisoning its single-minded focus on business and finance . For example , 2011 saw the launch of Bloomberg View , a dull , fairly centrist editorial page . It \u2019 s almost impressively unimpressive , populated by such lesser lights as Stephen Carter , Megan McArdle , Clive Crook and Peter Orszag .\nSo : What do Heilemann and Halperin bring to the table ? Well , says Justin Smith , chief executive of Bloomberg Media Group , they \u2019 re the \u201c epitome of the type of quality journalistic talent that moves seamlessly between different kinds of platforms. \u201d This word salad is a fancy-talk for \u201c they \u2019 re good on television , \u201d which isn \u2019 t exactly true .\nThe Game Change authors , report the Times , will `` anchor a daily television program that will also stream online , as well as write news articles and take part in live events ...

So much of what passes for it these days is embarrassing . But Heilemann and Halperin\u2014who , by the way , are celebrity journalists and not editors\u2014are an odd choice to run the show .

But , as Isaac Chotiner showed in an assessment of Double Down , they are perfectly capable of spinning a story they know to be false . In their telling , excerpted in New York , the 2012 election was actually quite close , and the debate prep for the second debate nearly sunk President Obama .
