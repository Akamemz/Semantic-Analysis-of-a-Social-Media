In 2011 , Mississippi voters rejected a similar referendum by an even larger margin .

Physicians will hesitate in how to care for complex health situations \u2026 doctors like me will leave Alabama rather than stay and practice substandard medicine\u2026 Alabamans deserve better . We all do. \u201d Yashica Robinson , CNN\n\u201c Many recent bills ban abortion after 6 weeks - before most women are even aware they are pregnant \u2014 and Alabama \u2019 s law constitutes an outright ban at any stage . But women will always seek out a way to end an unwanted pregnancy \u2014 the question is whether they can do so safely . In countries with extreme laws like those passed in Georgia , Ohio and now Alabama , women suffer and die . Georgia , for example , has the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation and you can expect those numbers to increase under a law that creates criminal suspicion around every miscarriage. \u201d Jon O \u2019 Brien , The Hill\n\u201c Showing just how far to the right the anti-abortion movement has pushed the \u2018 center \u2019 of the abortion debate , it was the bill \u2019 s rape and incest exceptions , since removed , that dominated the conversation in the Alabama Senate . It seemed forgone that the state would ban abortions for a vast majority of the women there . Lawmakers supporting abortion rights were left arguing to preserve the rape and incest exceptions. \u201d Editorial Board , New York Times\nThe right supports the goals behind the law , but worries that it may be counterproductive .\nThe right supports the goals behind the law , but worries that it may be counterproductive .\n\u201c Federal courts , following existing Supreme Court precedent , will certainly strike down the laws in Georgia and Alabama . But the Supreme Court should not continue to hold that state laws regulating abortion are unconstitutional , for the two simple reasons identified by Justice Scalia in his Casey dissent : ( 1 ) the Constitution says nothing about protecting a right to abortion and ( 2 ) American society had long permitted states to ban or otherwise regulate it\u2026\n\u201c [ However ] the abolitionist zeal on display in Alabama in particular runs the risk of making the ultimate extinction of abortion less likely\u2026 Nationwide , more than 75 percent of Americans think abortion should be legal early in pregnancy when the pregnancy was the result of rape . Public opinion can not be ignored in a democratic republic , and it would be a grave error to insist that no lives should be saved until all lives can be saved . \u201d\n\u201c The Alabama bill creates a situation that allows pro-abortion advocates to concentrate their pushback on the approximately 0.5 percent of procedures [ involving rape and incest ] rather than the 99.5 percent .
