    "content": "Students on the campus of Columbia University , 2009 ( Mike Segar/Reuters )\nStart by guaranteeing students \u2019 constitutional rights and holding schools to truth-in-lending standards .\nDespite the denials of universities boards , administrators , and faculty , American higher education , particularly in the humanities and social sciences , is a hopeless mess . What basis is there for such a harsh diagnosis ?\nOne , a college education is far too expensive . Nearly 45 million young Americans owe $ 1.5 trillion in student loans \u2014 a staggering sum unmatched in American history . Millions have either defaulted on their loans or are able to pay only the interest and are making no progress on the principle .\nUniversities have for decades upped their tuition and services higher than the rate of annual inflation . Yet they deny they have any responsibility for the staggering student debt , even though the encumbrances have altered the U.S. economy , culture , and demography . One of many reasons youth are marrying later , delaying child-rearing , and unable to buy a home is that so many of them are burdened well into their late twenties and early thirties with student-loan debt , on average over $ 30,000 per student . Again , the university more or less shrugs , insisting it has no responsibility for this collective national disaster that it helped create\nThe student-loan crisis could be alleviated if universities , not the federal government , were the co-signers of the loans , which would make them share with students the moral hazard of loan repayment . Instead of spending superfluously on \u201c diversity and inclusion \u201d czars and entire castes of non-teaching facilitators , universities would have incentives to lower non-teaching costs .
