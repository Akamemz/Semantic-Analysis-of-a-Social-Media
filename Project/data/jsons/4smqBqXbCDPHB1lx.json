    "content": "MM : Yeah , so there 's two ways of achieving herd immunity , which herd immunity being enough people have immunity to the virus that they 're able to form a protective wall around people who remain vulnerable . So , there 's two ways to do that . Either natural exposure out in the environment or a vaccination campaign , and what we 're really looking to do to be able to restart society , if we do n't have a widely available vaccine . It 's going to start little by little with people who 've been exposed naturally . Once we have a vaccine that works and we can roll it out on a larger scale , then we 're looking at trying to reach something like 80 % , 85 % of the population either receiving a vaccine or being able to demonstrate that they have antibodies against the coronavirus . That will give us enough protection that if a new case is imported from somewhere else , from some other hot spot , that there will be enough who are not able to get infected , that the virus does n't spread through the community at that exponential rate that we 're seeing right now .\nLG : Megan , I think we 're going to take a quick break shortly and then come back to you for the second half of the show . But I did want to ask you quickly about antibodies because we 're hearing a lot about this at the same time that we 're hearing about vaccine development . And I imagine that there 's some confusion for people who just are generally thinking about this as a cure for coronavirus . And of course , we know there is no cure currently , but what are the basics that people need to understand about the difference between blood plasma donations and how antibodies might help us counter the effects of coronavirus and what a vaccine would do ?\nMM : Yeah , that 's a really good question and an important distinction to make . So , the antibodies that people would be receiving through a plasma donation would be antibodies that they would be getting from someone who has already been exposed to the virus . Those antibodies can prime that person 's immune system and help them fight off that virus . So , we should be thinking about it as a treatment . Those antibodies are n't going to last forever , they 're going to eventually get broken down by that person 's body . In order to have longer lasting immunity , that person needs to have what are called B cells or memory cells that are actually producing their own antibodies . And that 's a different process . That would basically involve either having a vaccine or being exposed to the virus directly to jumpstart that pathway . So , when we 're talking about antibodies received through a plasma donation , think of it like a treatment that 's on the short order of I believe we 're talking about days to weeks , but what you would need to boost the immune system while you 're in the thick of an infection .\nMC : All right , let 's take a quick break and then when we come back , we 're going to talk about testing .\nMC : Welcome back . While developing a vaccine for the coronavirus may be a drawn out , complicated effort , developing a test for the virus is much easier , or at least it should be . But there 's been a shortage of tests here in the United States and issues with the reliability of tests on top of that . Megan , can you tell us why are we having such a difficult time with testing ?\nMM : Man , I wish I had an easy answer , but every week it 's really something new . So , at first the bottleneck in testing was that the FDA had only approved a single testing protocol in the US , so this was a test developed by the CDC in Atlanta . And what happened was that that test relies on a technology called RTPCR , which has to happen in a lab . You have to have a PCR machine , you have to have people who know how to use it . And at first the CDC was the only lab that was doing that testing . After the FDA approved the CDC protocol under this emergency use authorization , then the test from the CDC went out to all the public health labs in the US . Then there turned out to be a problem with those test kits , one of the reagents had an issue . It was not coming up with the right results , so that slowed things down a bit as well . Once the CDC issued new test kits , those went back out to the public health labs around the states and they started trying to ramp up their production .",
