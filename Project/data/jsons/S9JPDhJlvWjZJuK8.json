    "content": "ISIS , the world understands , is a violent jihadist group driven by twisted religious devotion and its dream of radical Islamist conquest . ISIS 's own members understand the group that way . But what if they 're wrong ? What if ISIS is not a spontaneous religious movement , but rather was constructed by a shadowy group of secular military leaders to fulfill their secret agenda ?\nExplosive new documents uncovered by Der Spiegel 's Christoph Reuter , published on Saturday , reveal that there is a dark secret at the heart of ISIS . It was not radical Islamists who conceived and created ISIS , they suggest , but rather a small group of senior Iraqi officers in Saddam Hussein 's brutal police state . Their plan appears to have been to use ISIS to reconquer Iraq . For them , jihadism was simply a means to the end of retaking the country they had lost , a counterattack to the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled them from power .\nDer Spiegel says it uncovered the documents from a house in Syria that was used by a former Iraqi military intelligence official who , before he was killed in a 2014 firefight , went by the name Haji Bakr . The documents show the blueprint for the creation of the Islamic State , written before the group became what it is today and executed to detail . While we have known for some time that former officers in Saddam 's military were working with ISIS \u2014 they shared a Sunni background and a hatred of the new American-installed government \u2014 these documents suggest the officers were far more involved in planning and launching the Islamic State than previously thought .\nAs Der Spiegel 's stunning investigation found , ISIS was organized in much the same way as Saddam 's police state . Haji Bakr 's goal was to use the chaos and extremism of the Syrian war to build up this new group in Syria , giving it a beachhead from which it could invade and conquer much of Iraq . Once there , it would set up an intricate and Orwellian system of control in the mold of Saddam 's Iraq .\nISIS , in other words , would replace one totalitarianism with another . Though Saddam 's Iraq had been Sunni and secular and ISIS 's Iraq would be Sunni and Islamist , this same group of former Saddam officials would remain at the top . For Haji Bakr and the other officers working with him , the group 's apocalyptic jihadism would simply be a vehicle for their return to power .\nThere is a simple reason why there is no mention in Bakr 's writings of prophecies relating to the establishment of an Islamic State allegedly ordained by God : He believed that fanatical religious convictions alone were not enough to achieve victory . But he did believe that the faith of others could be exploited . In 2010 , Bakr and a small group of former Iraqi intelligence officers made Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the emir and later `` caliph , '' the official leader of the Islamic State .

[ Haji ] Bakr was `` a nationalist , not an Islamist , '' says Iraqi journalist Hisham al-Hashimi .\nBakr 's journey from serving in a violently secular regime to helping found a violently Islamist group began in 2003 , after the US-led invasion of Iraq .
