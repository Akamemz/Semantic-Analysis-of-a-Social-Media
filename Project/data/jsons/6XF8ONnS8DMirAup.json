Of the top 50 , 37 have selective admissions or are magnet schools , meaning they screen students using a combination of entrance exam scores , grade-point average , state test results and assessments of their writing samples .\nIn short , to be the best , high schools should accept only the highest performing eighth graders , who \u2014 if the school doesn \u2019 t botch it \u2014 will become the highest performing 12th graders .\nEight of Newsweek \u2019 s top 50 are charter schools . For those who think an important role of public education is taking struggling students and raising their academic performance , this sounds promising . Charter schools are supposed to accept any child who applies . If the school is oversubscribed , there is to be a lottery .\nThe two top charter schools on the Newsweek list are the Basis high schools in Scottsdale and Tucson , part of an Arizona -based charter chain .\nAccording to the Basis Web site , the curriculum is heavily reliant on A.P . and college-level courses , and it includes Mandarin and Latin .\nThis means that only the strongest academic students need apply , and those who can \u2019 t cut it will leave .\nWhat does the student body look like at a Basis high school ? At Basis Scottsdale \u2014 the third best high school in America , according to Newsweek \u2014 95 percent of the 701 students are Asian or white .\nAsians make up 2.8 percent of the state population , but 41 percent of the Basis Scottsdale students .\nThere are 15 Hispanics ( 2 percent ) in a state that is about one-third Hispanic .\nThere are no Native Americans listed on the State Education Department \u2019 s Web site , though they make up 5 percent of Arizona \u2019 s population . The site lists 13 African-American students and no children of migrant workers . There are no children who qualify for subsidized lunches or who need special education classes .\nClearly , best schools would do best not to get bogged down serving students considered un-best .\nThe remaining five of the top 50 schools are in suburban districts where enrollment is open to all , as long as they are residents .\nThe one thing that these five schools have in common is that they are full of children from the nation \u2019 s wealthiest families .\nAmong the top 50 are high schools in Bronxville , N.Y. ( No . 40 ) , which has a median household income of $ 166,000 , and Jericho , N.Y. ( No . 41 ) , which has a median income of $ 128,000 , as compared with $ 54,000 for New York State ; also , Falls Church , Va. ( No . 45 ) , with a $ 111,000 median income versus $ 59,000 for the state .\nPeople who feel passionately about getting their children into best schools should stay away from the Midwest , which Newsweek has identified as an educational wasteland . From Montana south to Mississippi \u2014 2,000 miles \u2014 there are 14 contiguous states without a single high school among the 100 best , including Wisconsin , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska and Kansas .\nEven Massachusetts has only one school in the top 100 , which is surprising , since the state \u2019 s students have repeatedly led the nation on the federal reading and math tests .\nOn the other hand , this is what makes America great : Anybody can make up any formula to measure anything , which gives lots of places a chance to be best at something .\nWant the best high schools for your child ? Move to Texas or Florida . Texas has 15 of the 100 best , placing second over all nationwide , while Florida has 10 , the fourth most . This is no doubt due in good part to the reform efforts of George W. and Jeb Bush , who \u2014 like Newsweek \u2014 have made standardized test results a true measure of academic excellence .\nAt all costs , avoid Scarsdale , N.Y . It didn \u2019 t even make the top 1,000 . Though its average SAT score of 1935 would rank it 21st among the 100 best , the school does not offer A.P . courses , and Newsweek counts A.P . data as 40 percent of the rating .\nWhy no A.P. ? Scarsdale officials find that A.P . courses encourage students to go a mile wide and an inch deep , so the high school has created its own advanced courses . Instead of spending all their time working out of A.P . textbooks , students visit the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston and the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park , N.Y. , to do field research .\nTwo-thirds of Scarsdale seniors are accepted to colleges that the Barron \u2019 s Guide to the Most Competitive Colleges ranks as the \u201c most competitive \u201d in the country .
