    "content": "President Trump on Saturday defended his administration \u2019 s hurricane recovery effort in Puerto Rico and questioned the leadership of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz who is criticizing the president 's effort to get supplies , electricity and other relief to the U.S. island .\nBut after facing criticism over his attacks of the mayor , Trump tweeted praise for several other officials involved in the recovery , including the governors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands . He also praised Puerto \u2019 s Rico \u2019 s representative in Congress .\n`` We must all be united in offering assistance to everyone suffering in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the wake of this terrible disaster , '' the president tweeted .\n\u201c The Governor of Puerto Rico , Ricardo Rossello , is a great guy and leader who is really working hard , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Thank you Ricky ! \u201d\n\u201c Just spoke to Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands who stated that # FEMA and Military are doing a GREAT job ! Thank you Governor ! \u201d the president said .\nHe also tweeted : \u201c Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people . Thank you ! \u201d\nEarlier Saturday , the president singled out Cruz for criticism , accusing her of `` poor leadership . ''\n\u201c Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan , and others in Puerto Rico , who are not able to get their workers to help , \u201d Trump said in a series of tweets . `` They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort . 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job . \u201d\nHe also tweeted : `` Results of recovery efforts will speak much louder than complaints by San Juan Mayor . Doing everything we can to help great people of PR ! ''\nCruz , in response , said later Saturday morning that she \u2019 ll \u201c continue to do whatever I have to do \u201d to get federal hurricane assistance .\n\u201c I will continue to do whatever I have to do , say whatever I have to say , compliment the people I need to compliment and call out the people I need to call out , \u201d she told MSNBC . \u201c I am not going to be distracted by small comments , by politics , by petty issues . This is one goal and it 's to save lives . \u201d\nCruz also argued that Lt. General Jeffrey Buchanan , appointed Thursday to lead the administration \u2019 s response on the U.S. island , says he will need more troops and equipment .\n\u201c So , who am I ? \u201d she asked . \u201c I 'm just a little mayor from the capital city of San Juan . This is a three star general telling the world right now he does not have the appropriate means and tools to take care of the situation . \u201d\nTrump also tweeted Saturday : \u201c The Mayor of San Juan , who was very complimentary only a few days ago , has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump . \u201d\nTrump pledged Friday to spare no effort to help Puerto Ricans recover from Hurricane Maria 's ruinous aftermath even as Cruz accused the administration of `` killing us with the inefficiency . ''\nCruz said later Friday that she wanted to `` make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives , '' while the president asserted that U.S. officials and emergency personnel are working all-out against daunting odds , with `` incredible '' results .\nTrump also tweeted : \u201c The military and first responders , despite no electric , roads , phones etc. , have done an amazing job .

''\nPuerto Rico Gov . Ricardo Rossello , a Democrat , has said the administration is being responsive to the island 's needs and on Saturday appeared to try to deflect questions about Cruz 's comments .\nHe suggested the Trump-Cruz issue was to his `` side '' and said his message is that he 's `` here to help '' and collaborate with the federal government on resources .\nOn Friday , Rossello said Trump has responded to his requests after the island was clipped by Hurricane Irma , then struck by Maria .\nHe also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency and its director , Brock Long , have essentially been in contact with him `` all of the time .\nTrump 's acting homeland security secretary , Elaine Duke , visited the island Friday , surveying the landscape by helicopter in an hour-long tour , driving past still-flooded streets , twisted billboards and roofs with gaping holes , and offering encouragement to some of the 10,000 emergency personnel she says the U.S. government has on the ground .\nOn Thursday , the U.S. military named Buchanan to oversee the response effort .\nDuke tried , too , to move on from the remarks she made a day earlier in which she called the federal relief effort a `` good-news story .
