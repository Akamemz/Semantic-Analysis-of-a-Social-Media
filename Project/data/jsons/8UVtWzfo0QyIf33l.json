The call also included senior officials from the State Department and Department of Justice . The fact that the ban does not affect the vast majority of the world \u2019 s 1.6 billion Muslims is proof the measure is not a Muslim ban , the DHS official said .\nThe six countries carried over from the original 90-day travel ban are Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , and Yemen .\nWhat the executive order is , administration officials say , is a legitimate exercise of executive authority to keep Americans safe .
