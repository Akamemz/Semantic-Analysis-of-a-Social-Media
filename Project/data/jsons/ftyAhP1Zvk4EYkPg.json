    "content": "At this point , even amid one of the most captivating political upheavals in recent memory , the election process of 2016 is starting to feel like an extended car ride with a group of people after the conversational possibilities have run out . We \u2019 re all buckled up , with a long way to go , but everyone \u2019 s most irritating habits are already out in force . We \u2019 re feeling candidate fatigue , a malady first observed in the 1980s , perhaps earlier , and it \u2019 s the inevitable consequence of an exceptionally drawn-out political process combined with ample media coverage .\nCandidate fatigue strikes people at different times . People were already complaining of Al Gore fatigue in 1999 , and the complaints were deafening by 2000 . John Kerry fatigue\u2014yes , there was that in 2004 . But it plagues everyone eventually : Barack Obama , John McCain , Mitt Romney . Yes , yes , yes . And now it \u2019 s all-of-them fatigue . Hillary Clinton , Donald Trump , Bernie Sanders , Ted Cruz , and John Kasich rotate seats regularly , each of them taking turns at the wheel . Each takes a different approach to driving , all of them tiresome .\nDonald Trump used to be the most interesting driver , because he took strange turns and it kind of worked . He also crashed through fruit stands , and that was fascinating , at first . Then it seemed like he was driving through fruit stands for no reason other than that it pleased him . Perhaps you thought Trump had a grander plan with this , that there were some shortcuts being taken now in order to get everyone somewhere worthwhile later . Perhaps you don \u2019 t think so anymore .\nHillary Clinton is a more controlled driver , at first glance . She sits straight at the wheel , signals diligently , looks attentive . But she doesn \u2019 t seem to notice , or maybe care , that she \u2019 s weaving between lanes and belching up exhaust . Ask her about it and she smiles , sometimes laughs , and says she doesn \u2019 t know what you \u2019 re talking about . She sometimes sings , to project cheer . She does not have a good singing voice .\nTed Cruz , when driving , moves his seat back , leans the seat-back down , and steers with just one hand , his right , resting his left arm in the open window . This is meant to look confident , manly , and controlled . But it \u2019 s 40 degrees outside and raining . Everyone is cold . Ted has planned everything out carefully . He doesn \u2019 t want you to touch his things . When you left your journal in the hotel room , though , he found it and said he intended to keep it , because technically he was in possession of it . Then he started reading it and smirking , occasionally pushing his hand in the air in a shushing gesture and telling you to calm down .\nJohn Kasich pulls his seat nearly all the way forward , and he places both hands on the very top of the wheel , elbows at the bottom . He fumes at other drivers , and he gets angry when he makes a wrong turn . If he feels people aren \u2019 t behaving themselves , he likes to pull over , park on a shoulder , and turn around in his seat to lecture everyone . No one can explain why he \u2019 s in the car or where he \u2019 s going .\nBernie Sanders has two hands on the wheel and drives alertly but also , like Kasich , irritably . He yells a lot . He often lifts his arms and spreads his hands , upturned , into the air , to signal incredulity . When Hillary takes potshots at his driving , he tells her he \u2019 s driving fine . He looks tired , and the car \u2019 s running out of gas , but he thinks he can make it . People tell him to try some of the new features or do some reading to get up to speed on the auto world , but he has an approach to driving and he \u2019 s sticking to it .",
