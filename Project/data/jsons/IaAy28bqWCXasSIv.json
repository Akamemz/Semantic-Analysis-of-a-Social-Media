Two other things to look for : First , the masterful way in which Clinton says she has drawn no conclusions about events in Syria and elsewhere , and then draws rigorously reasoned conclusions . Second , her fascinating and complicated analysis of the Muslim Brotherhood 's ill-fated dalliance with democracy .\nJEFFREY GOLDBERG : It seems that you \u2019 ve shifted your position on Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions . By [ chief U.S. negotiator ] Wendy Sherman \u2019 s definition of maximalism , you \u2019 ve taken a fairly maximalist position\u2014little or no enrichment for Iran . Are you taking a harder line than your former colleagues in the Obama administration are taking on this matter ?\nHILLARY RODHAM CLINTON : It \u2019 s a consistent line . I \u2019 ve always been in the camp that held that they did not have a right to enrichment . Contrary to their claim , there is no such thing as a right to enrich . This is absolutely unfounded . There is no such right . I am well aware that I am not at the negotiating table anymore , but I think it \u2019 s important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there can not be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran . The preference would be no enrichment . The potential fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out . So , little or no enrichment has always been my position .\nJG : Am I wrong in saying that the Obama administration \u2019 s negotiators have a more flexible understanding of this issue at the moment ?\nHRC : I don \u2019 t want to speak for them , but I would argue that Iran , through the voice of the supreme leader , has taken a very maximalist position\u2014he wants 190,000 centrifuges and the right to enrich . And some in our Congress , and some of our best friends , have taken the opposite position\u2014absolutely no enrichment . I think in a negotiation you need to be very clear about what it is going to take to move the other side . I think at the moment there is a big debate going on in Tehran about what they can or should do in order to get relief from the sanctions . It \u2019 s my understanding that we still have a united P5+1 position , which is intensive inspections , very clear limits on what they can do in their facilities that they would permitted to operate , and then how they handle this question of enrichment , whether it \u2019 s done from the outside , or whether it can truly be constrained to meet what I think our standard should be of little-to-no enrichment . That \u2019 s what this negotiation is about .\nJG : But there is no sign that the Iranians are willing to pull back\u2014freezing in place is the farthest they seem to be willing to go . Am I wrong ?\nHRC : We don \u2019 t know . I think there \u2019 s a political debate . I think you had the position staked out by the supreme leader that they \u2019 re going to get to do what they want to do , and that they don \u2019 t have any intention of having a nuclear weapon but they nevertheless want 190,000 centrifuges ( laughs ) . I think the political , non-clerical side of the equation is basically saying , \u201c Look , you know , getting relief from these sanctions is economically and politically important to us . We have our hands full in Syria and Iraq , just to name two places , maybe increasingly in Lebanon , and who knows what \u2019 s going to happen with us and Hamas . So what harm does it do to have a very strict regime that we can live under until we determine that maybe we won \u2019 t have to any longer ? \u201d That , I think , is the other side of the argument .",
