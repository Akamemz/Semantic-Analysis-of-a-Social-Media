But that begs the question : What kind of Ford ?\nAs early as 1972 , there were reports that when a Ford Pinto was involved in a low-speed collision , the car would spontaneously burst into flames . According to a 1977 investigation by Mother Jones magazine , Ford was aware of the problem \u2014 resulting from a flaw in the gas tank design \u2014 but instead of paying to recall and redesign the car , Ford decided it would be cheaper to pay for the lawsuits . Ultimately , at least 27 people and as many as 180 people died as a result of Pinto fires . But it took the government forcing Ford to recall the Pinto for the problem to actually be solved .\nIn 2009 , millions of Americans lacked any health insurance whatsoever and millions more had private health insurance metaphorically designed to explode at the hint of any serious illness or preexisting conditions or exorbitant medical costs . So , in 2009 , 14,000 Americans were losing their health insurance every single day . And medical bills were prompting more than 60 percent of all bankruptcies in our nation . In other words , many health insurance policies were patently dangerous and unsafe .\nNow , Rep. Blackburn and her ilk might argue that people should have been free to buy the Pinto if they wanted , without government intrusion into personal choices or private business practice \u2014 just like they seem to want to argue that Americans should be free to hold onto their inadequate , costly and reckless insurance policies that throw them off at the slightest sign of illness while forcing costs up for the rest of us . But , arguably , most Americans want to buy cars that are safe . Auto companies didn \u2019 t want to install seat belts and airbags , just like Ford didn \u2019 t want to fix the Pinto . That was government regulation at work , making us all more safe \u2014 even if , in some cases , it made cars more expensive .
