First , take a look at Obama 's speech about the Bush Tax Cuts from earlier this week , in which he gives his predictable class-warfare spiel about how the wealthy need to pay more in taxes ( notably -- mercifully -- he left out that God-awful phrse `` fair share '' ) . In this excerpt , Obama is speaking about how tax cuts for the rich ruined the economy and caused mass deficit increases :\nAnd what happened ? The wealthy got wealthier , but most Americans struggled . Instead of creating more jobs , we had the slowest job growth in half a century . Instead of widespread prosperity , the typical family saw its income fall . And in just a few years , we went from record surpluses under Bill Clinton to record deficits that we are now still struggling to pay off today . So we don \u2019 t need more top-down economics . We \u2019 ve tried that theory . We \u2019 ve seen what happens . We can \u2019 t afford to go back to it . We need policies that grow and strengthen the middle class -- policies that help create jobs , that make education and training more affordable , that encourage businesses to start up and create jobs right here in the United States . So that \u2019 s why I believe it \u2019 s time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans -- folks like myself -- to expire . ( Applause . ) And , by the way , I might feel differently -- because it \u2019 s not like I like to pay taxes -- ( laughter ) -- I might feel differently if we were still in surplus . But we \u2019 ve got this huge deficit , and everybody agrees that we need to do something about these deficits and these debts . So the money we \u2019 re spending on these tax cuts for the wealthy is a major driver of our deficit , a major contributor to our deficit , costing us a trillion dollars over the next decade .\nSo there he goes , once more foisting the blame on W for the staggering deficits we 're currently staring at , and attributing their rise to tax cuts on the highest earners . But is that accurate ? Well , as you may have guessed , we would n't be here in this post if it were .\nJames K. Glassman over at Forbes finally became so tired of the left 's rhetoric about the historic deficits W created for us that he decided to do a little experiment , and figure out who , of the recent administrations , had the largest deficit-to-GDP ratio . See his results below :\nI decided to use three sets of calculations for each president : first , the deficit-to-GDP ratio from the fiscal year he took office to the fiscal year he left minus one ( thus , for Reagan : 1981-88 ) ; second , from his first fiscal year plus one to the fiscal year he left ( thus , 1982-89 ) ; and third , an average of the first two Here are the ratios of deficit to GDP for the past five presidents : Ronald Reagan\n* fiscal 2012 ends Sept. 30 , 2012 , so this figure is estimated Source : Economic Report of the President , February 2012 The results for President Bush are skewed by the 10.1 percent deficit/GDP ratio in fiscal 2009 . A large chunk of spending in that year went to the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP . In fiscal 2009 , TARP contributed $ 151 billion to the budget deficit , but in 2010 and 2011 , $ 147 billion of that amount was recouped and thus reduced the size of the deficit during President Obama \u2019 s watch . ( These calculations are complicated and are laid out by the Office of Management and Budget . See http : //www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/spec.pdf , p . 49 . )\nSo in the three-and-a-half short years this president has held the office , the deficit-to-GDP ratio has soared . And yet , here he is , telling us that the Bush Tax Cuts caused them , and that the only way to undo the deficit is to undo them now . Of course , the idea that the government will use all the funds collected from the proposed tax increase on decreasing the deficit -- much less that this will actually make a sizeable dent in it -- is somewhat laughable .\nFor an idea of how much money this will end up bringing in :\nOut of 119 million U.S. households , just 2.5 million -- or 2 percent -- reported making at least $ 250,000 in 2010 , according to Census Bureau figures . An estimated 940,000 taxpayers reporting business earnings will earn enough money to see their tax rates rise in 2013 unless lawmakers act , according to Congress ' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation . That is just 3.5 percent of taxpayers reporting business earnings -- a figure Democrats use to show how few businesses would pay higher tax rates under Obama 's plan . The committee also estimated that those 940,000 taxpayers will account for 53 percent of the $ 1.3 trillion in business earnings reported in 2013 -- a number Republicans cite to argue that the higher rates will hurt the economy and job creation .\nSo that 's great : let 's tax the people who are most responsible for any of the hiring that 's been done in our sluggish economy , while our deficit-to-GDP ratio is double what it 's ever been in recent years . Obama 's going to have to come up with something better than that -- but first , he 'll have to admit the damage he 's done to the country 's economic standing .",
