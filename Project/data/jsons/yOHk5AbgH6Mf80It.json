One of the most likely changes is a rule that would require dealers who exceed a certain number of gun sales each year to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives and to perform background checks on buyers .\nThe action contemplated by the White House hinges on the legal definition of those who are \u201c engaged in the business \u201d of buying and selling guns for profit as their livelihood . Current law doesn \u2019 t set a total number of annual gun sales to qualify as a business , but Democratic lawmakers and gun control advocacy groups are urging the White House to issue the rule as a way to close the \u201c gun show loophole \u201d that allows firearms to be sold without background checks at such expositions .\nFederally licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks on all gun sales , and only people who are deemed to be \u201c engaged in the business \u201d of dealing in guns are required to get ATF licenses .\nWhether or not such action would have any appreciable effect on gun violence , it \u2019 s essentially the reverse of Mr. Clinton \u2019 s far more direct response to gun crime in the mid-1990s .\nLaws passed under the Clinton administration , such as the Brady Law and the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994 , changed the licensing procedures for federal firearms licensees by increasing fees and requiring gun dealers to submit photographs and fingerprints as part of their applications .\nPrimarily because of the increased regulation , the number of federal firearms licensees dropped from about 282,000 in 1993 to fewer than 104,000 by 1999 .\n\u201c The complaints from the gun-control groups [ in the 1990s ] were that there were way , way too many FFLs , and the government needed to crack down on and reduce the number of licensees , \u201d said Lawrence Keane , general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation , the firearms industry \u2019 s trade association . \u201c Now all of a sudden , we \u2019 re hearing the gun control groups say there aren \u2019 t enough licenses , and everybody needs to have a license . \u201d\nGun homicides reached a peak in the U.S. in 1993 at seven homicides per 100,000 people and steadily declined after that to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people in 2000 .

From 2010 to 2013 , the most recent year for which data are available , the number of gun homicides has hovered between 11,000 and 12,000 per year .\nDespite the reduction , most Americans think gun violence is on the rise . Pew \u2019 s survey in 2013 found that 56 percent of Americans believed the number of gun crimes had gone up compared with 20 years ago , while 12 percent said gun crimes had declined .\nA Pew survey in July 2015 found that 85 percent of Americans ( 88 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans ) favored expanded background checks for private gun sales and purchases at gun shows .\nThe Senate stopped an effort in 2013 to expand background checks on gun purchases .
