The operation involved a combination of fighter jets , bombers , Predator drones and Tomahawk missiles launched from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf .\n`` We 're going to do what 's necessary to take the fight to this terrorist group , '' President Obama said Tuesday , before traveling to New York for meetings at the U.N . He cautioned that the effort `` will take time . ''\nLt. Gen. William Mayville Jr. , director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , described the operation as `` the beginnings of a sustained campaign . '' The strikes in Syria `` destroyed or damaged '' multiple targets , according to the U.S. military , which reported `` all aircraft safely exited the strike areas . ''\nThe mission was not limited to hitting Islamic State positions . Centcom said that U.S. aircraft also struck eight targets associated with another terrorist group called the Khorasan Group , made of up Al Qaeda veterans . Those strikes , near the northwestern Syrian city of Aleppo , targeted training camps , a munitions production facility , a communication building and command-and-control facilities .\nCentcom said the Khorasan Group was involved in `` imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests . ''\nThe military strikes come less than two weeks after Obama , on Sept. 10 , authorized U.S. airstrikes inside Syria as part of a broad campaign to root out the militants . The strikes ostensibly put the United States , for now , on the same side as Bashar Assad , the Syrian strongman whose ouster Obama once sought -- though the Assad regime was not involved in Monday 's strikes .\nSyria 's Foreign Ministry told the Associated Press that the U.S. informed Syria 's envoy to the U.N. that `` strikes will be launched against the terrorist Daesh group in Raqqa . '' The statement used an Arabic name to refer to the Islamic State group , which is more commonly known as ISIS or ISIL .\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki made clear in a statement Tuesday that the U.S. `` did not request the regime 's permission '' and had warned the Syrian government `` not to engage U.S . aircraft . ''\n`` We did not coordinate our actions with the Syrian government , '' she said .\nU.S. officials said that the airstrikes began around 8:30 p.m . ET , and were conducted by the U.S. , Bahrain , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates . The first wave of strikes finished about 90 minutes later , though the operation was expected to have lasted several hours .\n`` We believe we hit , largely , everything we were aiming at , '' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told Fox News . Kirby said the military made the decision to strike early Monday .\nThe operation involved 47 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles launched from the USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea . Officials told Fox News that B-1 bombers , F-16 and F-18 fighters , and Predator drones were also used . The F-18s flew missions off the USS George H.W . Bush in the Persian Gulf .\nObama , in announcing plans for an expanded campaign against ISIS earlier this month , said : \u201c I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country , wherever they are . That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria , as well as Iraq . ''\nThe following day , at a conference with Secretary of State John Kerry , key Arab allies promised they would `` do their share '' to fight the Islamic State militants . The Obama administration , which at a NATO meeting in Wales earlier this month also got commitments from European allies as well as Canada and Australia , has insisted that the fight against the Islamic State militants could not be the United States ' fight alone .\nUntil now , U.S. airstrikes have been limited to specific missions in northern Iraq , where 194 missions have been launched since August 8 . Lawmakers and military advisers , though , had stressed for weeks that any campaign against the Islamic State would have to include action in Syria , where the militant network is based .\n`` To defeat ISIS , we must cut off the head of the snake , which exists in Syria , '' Rep. Michael McCaul , R-Texas , said in a statement late Monday . `` I support the administration \u2019 s move to conduct airstrikes against ISIS wherever it exists . ''\nA senior official told Fox News that Obama was briefed by military officials on the operation throughout the night . Earlier in the evening , the president spoke to House Speaker John Boeher , R-Ohio , and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. A White House official also updated House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , on the progress of the airstrikes .\nBecause the United States had stayed out of the Syria conflict for so long , the Obama administration had spent the last several weeks scrambling to gather intelligence about possible targets in Syria , launching surveillance missions over the country last month .\nSyrian activists reported several airstrikes on militant targets in the northern city of Raqqa , ISIS 's main base . One Raqqa-based activist , speaking on condition of anonymity , told AP that the airstrikes lit the night sky over the city , and reported a power cut that lasted for two hours .\nThe head of the main Western-backed Syrian opposition group , Hadi Bahra , welcomed the commencement of airstrikes in Syria .\n`` Tonight , the international community has joined our fight against ISIS in Syria , '' he said in a statement . `` We have called for airstrikes such as those that commenced tonight with a heavy heart and deep concern , as these strikes begin in our own homeland .
