    "content": "\u201c Diversity \u201d is the most powerful word in higher education today . No other has so much authority . Older words , like \u201c excellence \u201d and \u201c originality , \u201d remain in circulation , but even they have been redefined in terms of diversity .\nAt Yale , where I have taught for 40 years , a large bureaucracy exists to ensure that the university \u2019 s commitment to diversity is rigorously enforced\u2014in student admissions , faculty hiring and curricular design . Yale has an Office of Diversity and Inclusion , a Dean of Diversity and Faculty Development , an Office of Gender and Campus Culture and a dizzying array of similar positions and programs . At present , more than 150 full-time staff and student representatives serve in some pro-diversity role .\nYale \u2019 s situation is far from exceptional . \u201c Diversity and inclusion \u201d is a dogma repeated with uniform piety in the official pronouncements of nearly every college and university . At Dartmouth , the Office of Pluralism and Leadership \u201c engages students in identity , community and leadership development , advancing Dartmouth \u2019 s commitment to academic success , diversity , inclusion and wellness. \u201d The University of Michigan proclaims that \u201c diversity is key to individual flourishing , educational excellence and the advancement of knowledge. \u201d At the University of Oklahoma , students are required to complete a mandatory \u201c Freshman Diversity Experience \u201d by the end of their first semester .\nThat diversity should be a value seems beyond dispute . The existence on campus of a range of beliefs , values and experiences is essential to the spirit of inquiry and debate that lies at the heart of academic life . Who wants to go to a school where everyone thinks alike ?\nBut diversity , as it is understood today , means something different . It means diversity of race , ethnicity , gender and sexual orientation . Diversity in this sense is not an academic value . Its origin and aspiration are political . The demand for ever-greater diversity in higher education is a political campaign masquerading as an educational ideal .\nThe demand for greater academic diversity began its strange career as a pro-democratic idea . Blacks and other minorities have long been underrepresented in higher education . A half-century ago , a number of schools sought to address the problem by giving minority applicants a special boost through what came to be called \u201c affirmative action. \u201d This was a straightforward and responsible strategy .\nBut in 1978 , in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , the Supreme Court told American colleges and universities that they couldn \u2019 t pursue this strategy directly , by using explicit racial categories . It allowed them to achieve the same goal indirectly , however , by arguing that diversity is essential to teaching and learning and requires some attention to race and ethnicity . Schools were able to continue to honor their commitment to social justice but only by converting it into an educational ideal .\nThe commitment was honorable , but the conversion has been ruinous . The effects of racial prejudice have always been the greatest slur on our commitment to democratic equality . But the transformation of diversity into a pedagogical theory has weakened our democracy by undermining the common ground of reason on which citizens must strive to meet . The crucial confusion is the equation of a diversity of ideas with diversity of race , ethnicity and sexual preference . This has several pernicious effects .\nOne is that it encourages minority students , and eventually all students , to think that a departure from the beliefs and sentiments associated with their group is a violation of the terms on which they were admitted to the university . If students contribute to the good of diversity by expressing the racially , ethnically or sexually defined views that members of their group are expected to share , then a repudiation or even critical scrutiny of these views threatens to upset the school \u2019 s entire educational program . It takes special nerve for an African-American student to defend inner-city policing or a gay student to support the baker who refuses to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple .\nShare Your Thoughts Should colleges make diversity a central value ? Join the conversation below .\nFor this program to work , it is essential that students remain in the corners to which they have been assigned . Indeed , it is not enough merely to recognize that the members of each group contribute some distinctive dimension to their school \u2019 s diversity . To reassure those whose groups have been the victims of social prejudice and discrimination , extra deference must be given to their life experience . The members of more privileged groups must be taught to \u201c check their privilege , \u201d and the identity of minority students must be treated as a possession that no one else may \u201c appropriate , \u201d in however well-meaning a way .\nThe upshot is that students are lauded for the beliefs and feelings they bring to their school on account of their separate identities , rather than being reminded of what they all stand to gain by being there\u2014the inestimable privilege of joining in a rational inquiry that subjects every one of their sentiments and beliefs to the same rigorous demand for explanation and justification .\nIn politics , group solidarity is a condition of success . But in college , it is an obstacle to the pursuit of what Walt Whitman colorfully called the \u201c idiocracy \u201d of individual temperament and expression that sets each of us apart from every other . The politically motivated and group-based form of diversity that dominates campus life today discourages students from breaking away , in thought or action , from the groups to which they belong . It invites them to think of themselves as representatives first and free agents second . And it makes heroes of those who put their individual interests aside for the sake of a larger cause . That is admirable in politics . It is antithetical to one of the signal goods of higher education .\nThis is one of the things people mean when they say that campus life has become \u201c politicized. \u201d It also helps to explain the culture of grievance that is so prominent there . Examples are legion . At Yale , where the heads of the undergraduate residences used to be called \u201c masters , \u201d students successfully campaigned to have the title changed because it reminded them of an antebellum plantation . Last year , a yoga club at American University was disbanded after complaints that it invited a non-Indian group to perform a dance based on the Ramayana , a classical Hindu epic . At Oberlin , all classes were canceled and a communitywide gathering called when someone dressed in what appeared to be a KKK costume was spied on campus . It proved to be a woman in a blanket .\nGrievance is the stuff of political life .

Important ones are often inflamed by passion too .

Today , the spirit of grievance has been imported into the academy , where it undermines the common search for truth by permeating it with a sense of hurt and wrong on the part of minority students , and guilt on the part of those who are blamed for their suffering .\nThe life of the classroom is transformed as a result . It is common to hear complaints that an assigned text is disrespectful of women , blacks , the gender-fluid or some other oppressed or marginalized group .
