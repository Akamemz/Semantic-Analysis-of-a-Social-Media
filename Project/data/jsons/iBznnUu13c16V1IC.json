People get scared , politicians respond to that fear with promises that the state will step in and make everything better , and government ends up larger and more powerful . The pandemic of COVID-19 coronavirus threatens a world-wide wave of sickness , but it 's the healthiest thing to happen to government power in a very long time . As it leaves government with a rosy glow , however , our freedom will end up more haggard than ever .\n`` You can look at it as socialized medicine , '' Rep.

You could , I suppose , rely on the same not-yet-entirely government-dominated health system that deals with influenza outbreaks every year . In the 2019-20 flu season , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention our long-time viral enemy has , so far , infected 32 million Americans , sent 310,000 to the hospital , and killed 18,000 .\nThat 's not to say that COVID-19 is n't serious , or that people are n't suffering from its effects . But we forget about our annual wrestling match with a deadly disease , the flu , while freaking out about the emergence of a virus that is frightening mostly because of its novelty , despite any evidence that we 're inadequate to the challenge .\nFear is the key here to Yoho 's sudden love for socialized medicine , as well as other panicked proposals for the government to somehow save us from the pandemic .
