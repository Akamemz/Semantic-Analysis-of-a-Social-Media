( Shannon Stapleton/Reuters )\nA lot has happened in the last decade \u2014 including a lot of things being called racist , sexist , offensive , or insensitive .\nHere , in no particular order , are 24 of the most absurdly politically correct moments of the decade :\n1 . A college diversity-training course taught that it was culturally insensitive to expect people to be on time .\nA Clemson University training course taught its attendees that it is offensive to expect people to be on time , because \u201c time may be considered fluid \u201d in other cultures.-\nAccording to a piece in Everyday Feminism , \u201c trigger warning \u201d is actually in itself a trigger \u2014 because it could \u201c be re-traumatizing for folks who have suffered military , police , and other forms of violence. \u201d ( The piece recommended using \u201c content warning \u201d instead . )\n3 . A professor was accused of sexual harassment for saying that effort is 10 percent of the grade .\nA Brooklyn College of City University of New York professor says he was forced to change his syllabus after he was accused of \u201c sexual harrassment \u201d for stating that effort was 10 percent of the grade .\n4 . A campus survey included a trigger warning to caution college students that it may contain \u201c anatomical names of body parts . \u201d\nThe survey was distributed at several major universities \u2014 because , apparently , college students just might not be able to handle the kinds of words that most kids hear in their middle-school biology classes .\n5 . University researchers demanded that we accept people who \u201c identify as real vampires . \u201d\nApparently , it \u2019 s the least we can do to prevent anti-vampire discrimination .\n6 . A Seattle-area councilman was concerned about the city hosing poop off of its sidewalks because he thought that it might seem too racially insensitive .\nThe area in question reportedly stank like \u201c urine and excrement \u201d \u2014 but one councilman was worried that hosing it down could be a microaggression .\n7 .
