    "content": "Others argue that \u201c Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person . There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\n\u201c No one spied on the Trump campaign . The Steele dossier did not set off the Russia investigation . Two FBI employees , FBI attorney Lisa Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok , were not decision-makers and did not taint the investigation . In short , the panoply of screwy accusations meant to smear the FBI was false\u2026 Horowitz deserves credit for sticking to the facts and resisting what must have been intense pressure to go along with an administration bent on sustaining blatantly false conspiracy theories. \u201d Jennifer Rubin , Washington Post\n\u201c The investigation was not an investigation of the Trump campaign . It was four investigations of individuals\u2014Carter Page , George Papadopoulos , Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn\u2014associated with the campaign but about whom there was specific reason for concern . In other words , investigators were not spying on the Trump campaign . They had concerns about specific people and their relationship with Russia , just as the FBI has always said\u2026 Page has a right to be pissed off . The inspector general has , after all , concluded that serious errors took place in seeking Page \u2019 s surveillance orders . But that \u2019 s about as far as it goes . The errors were not political . They were not part of some coup . And in any event , the Page FISA applications did not end up being all that important. \u201d Benjamin Wittes , Lawfare Blog\nOthers argue that \u201c there are important systemic problems with the FBI and the way that the U.S. government approves invasive surveillance techniques on American citizens\u2026 the Clinton Foundation investigation began\u2014and this is no joke\u2014with an anti-Hillary book paid for by the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon . If the FBI is making errors in seeking permission to surveil current or former advisers to a presidential campaign , the most politically sensitive kind of investigation , it suggests that there are many more flawed applications to be found in operations where the investigations are not nearly so delicate . The process for seeking permission to spy on American citizens suspected of being foreign agents should be more adversarial than it is , if only to keep the government honest. \u201d Adam Serwer , The Atlantic\nSome posit that \u201c The conclusion that the predication standard was satisfied comes as no surprise . The standard is low , and deliberately so . While this standard prevents the FBI from opening an investigation on a whim or for an improper personal or political purpose , it allows probes to begin on even the slightest indication of a threat to public safety or national security . A higher standard would handcuff the FBI from completing its mission to protect and defend the American people\u2026 \u201c When predication indicates a threat to public safety or national security , the FBI has a duty to investigate . That duty applies even when the stakes are high , and the target is a powerful person in government . For the FBI to ignore such a threat would be to shirk its responsibilities , and instead leave our nation at risk. \u201d Barbara McQuade , USA Today\n\u201c Was the investigation into claims of Russian interference a \u2018 hoax , \u2019 as Trump and his allies have long claimed ? No , Horowitz found . By the summer of 2016 , U.S. intelligence agencies already knew that Russian hackers had breached Democratic Party servers with cyberattacks . FBI agents also received word from an Australian diplomat that George Papadopoulos , a low-ranking Trump campaign aide , claimed he had been approached by a purported Russian intermediary with offers of political dirt on Clinton . Those factors and others gave agents the minimal basis they needed under FBI policy to open an investigation. \u201d Matt Ford , New Republic\nFormer FBI Director James Comey writes , \u201c On Monday , we learned from a report by the Justice Department \u2019 s inspector general , Michael Horowitz , that the allegation of a criminal conspiracy was nonsense . There was no illegal wiretapping , there were no informants inserted into the campaign , there was no \u2018 spying \u2019 on the Trump campaign\u2026 Most important , Horowitz \u2019 s report found that the investigation was opened and conducted according to the rules , finding no \u2018 evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced [ the ] decision \u2019 to start it or how to run it. \u201d James Comey , Washington Post\nThe right sees the report as evidence of extensive improper behavior by the FBI , especially the reliance on the Steele dossier to obtain warrants against Carter Page .\nThe right sees the report as evidence of extensive improper behavior by the FBI , especially the reliance on the Steele dossier to obtain warrants against Carter Page .\n\u201c How many \u2018 missteps \u2019 does it take for an FBI investigation to be considered improper ? \u2026 According to IG Michael Horowitz , the magic number lies somewhere north of 17 . That \u2019 s the number of \u2018 serious performance failures \u2019 uncovered by his investigation into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrants obtained by the FBI in connection with former Trump campaign aide Carter Page \u2014 who , in the end , was never charged with any crime\u2026\n\u201c As it turns out , all the factual errors and missing exculpatory information in the misleading FISA-warrant applications happened to skew in the same , convenient , direction . And while Horowitz couldn \u2019 t uncover evidence of any \u2018 intentional misconduct , \u2019 he also couldn \u2019 t get any \u2018 satisfactory explanations for the errors or problems we identified \u2019 ... Let \u2019 s not forget that these agents felt the need to deceive a FISA court that already rubber-stamps basically anything they want . Since 1979 , the court has rejected under .04 percent of all surveillance applications . \u201d\n\u201c Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz , as he explains , is bound to assume good faith unless given \u2018 documentary or testimonial evidence \u2019 otherwise . Yet he has compiled a factually damning report\u2026 Mr. Horowitz is not a criminal investigator . He lacks subpoena power , much less mind-reading power . If somebody was thinking , \u2018 This Steele material looks bogus but let \u2019 s use it anyway ; \u2019 he would not expect to find documentary and testimonial proof of it . And which file drawer should he search for documentary and testimonial evidence that the country would have been better served by a wiser , more circumspect FBI leadership , one less influenced by a manifest belief that Mr. Trump was unfit and Mrs. Clinton was certain to be the next president ? \u201d\n\u201c The IG \u2019 s report raises alarming questions regarding the level of discernment of those within the FBI . If a Democratic campaign had been the target of spying , would those in the FBI have treated the salacious ( and frankly , ridiculous ) dossier with more scrutiny ? If they knew the allegations against Carter Page were increasingly suspect , why did they continue to file a FISA renewal , not once but THREE more times ? The FBI should be forced to answer these questions\u2026 It should be deeply unsettling that a figure funded by the Democratic Party was able to peddle falsities to the FBI that were then used to justify spying on their political opponents . \u201d\n\u201c The [ Steele ] dossier 's tales were taken seriously by officials in the highest ranks of the FBI \u2014 then-director James Comey and top deputy Andrew McCabe . In January 2017 , Comey briefed President-elect Trump on the dossier 's most sensational allegations . The briefing provided a hook for some news organizations to tell the public of the dossier 's existence , and then , days later , publish the entire document . The reporting did terrible damage to a new president as he took office\u2026 The report makes clear the dossier never had even a shred of credibility . Steele had no firsthand knowledge of anything in the document . He got all his information secondhand or thirdhand from sources who themselves heard things secondhand or thirdhand . \u201d\n\u201c FBI investigations require a fairly low threshold for approval . But the FBI is also dutybound to close investigations once an investigative theory has been disproven , or when exculpatory evidence comes to light . That didn \u2019 t happen here\u2026\n\u201c [ It bears stressing that Horowitz ] can not compel any witness outside of DOJ to cooperate or be interviewed . This is not the case with U.S. Attorney John Durham , tasked by the attorney general to review the origins of the Russia investigation\u2026 The most likely reason why Durham took such an unprecedented step in announcing his investigation \u2019 s findings to date is that they contradict the inspector general 's findings on bias . When the dust is settled on Durham 's investigation , backed by the subpoena power that Horowitz lacks , the Trump opponents celebrating the Horowitz findings may find themselves with an egg or two on their faces . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see .
