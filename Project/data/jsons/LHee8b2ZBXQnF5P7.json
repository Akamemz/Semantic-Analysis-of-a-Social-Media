    "content": "Democrats this week approved legislation to require background checks for essentially all sales and transfers of firearms -- but rejected GOP-led efforts to amend the legislation to alert law enforcement authorities when gun buyers , including illegal immigrants , fail those background checks .\nThe House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of the bill 23-15 , in a strict party-line vote , sending it to the House floor . If approved by the full House , the bill would be the most significant gun-control legislation approved by either chamber of Congress in at least a decade -- although it stands little chance of passage in the Senate , where Republicans command a slim majority .\nRepublicans in the House charged that H.R . 8 , known as `` The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 , '' should have included Florida Rep. Greg Steube 's proposed amendment to require that law enforcement be notified `` when an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a federal background check . '' ( H.R . 8 was numbered in honor of former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords , who was shot in Arizona on Jan. 8 , 2011 by a mentally ill gunman . )\n\u201c Clearly , the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee don \u2019 t care about preventing gun violence , they simply are playing politics with Americans \u2019 Second Amendment rights , \u201d Steube , a Republican , said after the vote . \u201c The fact that Democrats do not want law enforcement notified if an individual attempting to purchase a firearm fails a background check is truly troubling . \u201d\nHe continued : \u201c In rejecting this amendment , the Democrats have shown their true colors . It is clear they are not interested in preventing gun violence or stopping the illegal purchase of firearms , but rather they are only interested in limiting the rights of law-abiding citizens to advance their own political agenda . ''\nWednesday 's vote came a day before the one-year anniversary of the high school shooting in Parkland , Florida , that killed 17 people . However , Steube dismissed arguments that the massacre necessitated the new legislation .\n\u201c As written now , H.R . 8 would not have prevented any of the mass shootings in Florida in recent years , \u201d Steube 's office said in a press release . \u201c The shooter in Parkland passed a background check before purchasing a firearm , the shooter at Pulse Nightclub passed a background check before purchasing a firearm , and the shooter just weeks ago that murdered five women in District 17 passed a background check before purchasing the handgun he used in the commission of that heinous crime . ''\n`` Democrats in the Judiciary Committee just voted against notifying ICE when an illegal alien fails a background check to buy a gun , '' Gaetz wrote on Twitter . `` They hate ICE so much that they 'd keep ICE in the dark when illegals try to get guns ! ''\nThe vote on the bill came after a contentious , daylong hearing in which Republicans offered a series of other amendments in addition to Steube 's proposal , all of which were blocked by Democrats . Among the rejected amendments were some seeking to address background check fees , which Republicans said could be unduly burdensome for family members trying to transfer guns to relatives .\nRepublicans said they were ready to offer additional amendments when Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler , D-N.Y. , shut off debate around 8 p.m. , 10 hours after the hearing began .\nNadler called the background checks bill long overdue to address a `` national crisis of gun violence '' that claimed nearly 40,000 lives in 2017 .\n`` Our country is awash in guns , and we have the shameful death toll to show for it , '' he said .\nRep. Doug Collins of Georgia , the panel 's senior Republican , called Nadler 's action `` disturbing '' and said it did not bode well for the two-year congressional session .\n`` If this is the way the chairman wants to begin this session of Congress , I really wonder where we go from here '' and whether the two parties can work together , Collins said .\nBut Democrats said Republicans were delaying a vote on the bill because they oppose universal background checks for gun purchases .\n`` This is n't a debate , it 's a show , '' said Rep. Val Demings , D-Fla. She called universal background checks for all gun sales common sense and said , `` Let 's move forward . ''\nAt one point , Steube displayed a large cup that read , `` The Second Amendment is my gun permit . ''\nDemocrats have pledged additional gun legislation , including restrictions on high-capacity magazines and a measure to allow temporary removal of guns from people deemed an imminent risk to themselves or others .\nMeanwhile , fellow freshman Rep. Madeleine Dean , D-Pa. , said lawmakers `` know background checks work , that they save lives , and yet we need to close loopholes '' that allow some private purchases and transfers to be made without background checks .\n`` They hate ICE so much that they 'd keep ICE in the dark when illegals try to get guns ! '' \u2014 Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz\nInstead of working with Democrats , `` Republicans are adding more loopholes , which is shameful , '' Dean said .\nHowever , earlier this month , gun violence experts from the Center for Gun Policy and Research and the Violence Prevention Research Program conducted a study in Washington state , Colorado and Delaware to analyze whether state laws requiring more background checks actually resulted in more checks .\nThe results , published in medical journal Injury Prevention , suggest the laws had little impact .\nDelaware was the only state that saw apparent results , with an increase ranging from 22 to 34 percent based on the type of firearm . But according to the study , `` no overall changes were observed in Washington and Colorado . ''\nThe study said data `` external to the study '' suggested Washington saw a \u201c modest , but consistent \u201d increase in background checks for private-party sales , and Colorado saw a similar increase in checks for non-gun show sales .\nThe push comes as reports emerged that an initial background check five years ago failed to flag an out-of-state felony conviction that would have prevented a man from buying the gun he used to kill five co-workers and wound six other people , including five responding police officers , at a suburban Chicago manufacturing plant this week , authorities say .\nGary Martin , who was killed in a shootout with officers Friday , ending his deadly rampage at the Henry Pratt Co. in Aurora , was issued a firearm owner 's identification card in January 2014 after a background check failed to show a 1995 aggravated assault conviction in Mississippi , Aurora police Chief Kristen Ziman said Saturday .\nHe bought the Smith & Wesson handgun he used in Friday 's attack two months later , on March 11 , 2014 , she said . Five days after that , he applied for a concealed carry permit , which included a more rigorous background check that used digital fingerprinting and that did flag his Mississippi felony conviction , which led the Illinois State Police to revoke his permit .\nSeparately , Republicans pushed to allow exceptions for victims of domestic violence and transfers among family members , but were dismissed by Democrats .\nRep. Lucy McBath , D-Ga. , a freshman whose son was killed by gun violence , said she has been working on gun legislation since his death more than six years ago .\n`` As a survivor of gun violence myself , I refuse to let my colleagues stand here and devalue the importance that this bill has , '' she said .\nAnd Rep. Ted Deutch , D-Fla. , said that while the bill `` ca n't bring back '' any of those killed in Parkland or other shootings , it will help reduce gun violence .\n`` If this legislation prevents one person wishing to do harm to others with a gun from doing that , it will be something we can be proud of , '' he said .",
