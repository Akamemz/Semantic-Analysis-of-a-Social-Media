Instead , the Michigan couple are encountering a growing gap in health-care coverage that the government overhaul will do nothing to fix .\nThe Deanes say they got hit last year with rate increases on both of their long-term-care policies , insurance plans that pay for nursing homes or in-home care . Manulife Financial Corp. 's John Hancock unit told Mrs. Deane that the premium on her 10-year-old policy would jump 77 % to $ 6,406 a year . Her husband 's insurer , Unum Group , increased his premium by 25 % .\nAfter they complained , Hancock trimmed Mrs. Deane 's rate hike to 46 % .

In general , the insurers say , they give policyholders ways to reduce or eliminate a looming rate increase , generally by giving up part of their benefits .\nThe long-term-insurance industry now is shrinking , premiums are soaring and there is no fix in sight . At the same time , government safety-net programs , already under cost-cutting pressure , are bracing for demand from more of the 77 million aging baby boomers .\nRelated Article What You Need to Know About Long-Term-Care Insurance\nPresident Barack Obama 's health-care overhaul is supposed to provide insurance for millions of Americans . But the administration abandoned an effort to provide affordable long-term care , concluding it was too expensive . Instead , Congress appointed a commission to find ideas that could become law in five years .\nCurrently , Medicare pays for only short stays in nursing homes or in-home care under limited conditions . For the most part , seniors who need care have to burn through their savings to pay for it . Only after they are impoverished will Medicaid\u2014the government health program for poor people\u2014pay for a basic level of care .\nInsurers have been aware of this gap for decades , and many began selling long-term-care policies in the 1980s and 1990s . They vowed to provide policyholders with better access to high-quality nursing homes and home-based health care than Medicaid .\nBut insurers underestimated how fast medical costs would rise , and how many seniors would actually use the benefits . And they underpriced the insurance premiums . Making matters worse , some insurers that were `` hungry for market share '' charged too little at first and planned to increase premiums later , says Joseph M. Belth , editor of the Insurance Forum newsletter and professor emeritus of insurance at Indiana University .\nMany once-prominent sellers of long-term-care insurance are in full retreat . Five of the 10 largest sellers , including MetLife Inc. , Prudential Financial Inc. and Unum , have sharply reduced or discontinued sales since 2010 , according to Moody 's Investors Service .\nOnly a dozen or so companies still sell meaningful numbers of policies , down from about 100 a decade ago , according to LifePlans Inc. , a consultant . In the past decade , sales to individuals have fallen by two-thirds to 233,000 policies a year , and the number of insured people is stuck at about seven million .\nMost of the actuarial assumptions made by insurers years ago turned out to be overly optimistic . Underestimating how long elderly policyholders would live\u2014and collect benefits as a result\u2014led to a 14 % shortfall in premiums , according to a presentation to college students by PricewaterhouseCoopers principal Larry Rubin .\nAnd many state regulators erred by routinely signing off on the premium on the new products and subsequent rate increases without questioning the companies ' pricing assumptions , some officials say .\nSince then , many states have adopted `` rate stabilization '' laws to tighten oversight . Michigan , where the Deanes live , adopted such changes in 2006 `` to reduce the potential of future rate increases by requiring a more accurate initial pricing of policies by insurers , '' says an insurance department spokesman .\nThe insurance industry also failed to realize how desperate many Americans are to protect themselves from runaway nursing-home costs . So they cling to their long-term-care coverage for dear life .\nMany insurers predicted that 5 % to 7 % of people who bought long-term-care coverage would cancel their policies each year without tapping their benefits .\nInstead , the annual cancellation rate at many insurers has been less than 2 % , actuaries say . Initial premiums would have been about 35 % higher if insurers had assumed such a low cancellation rate , PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates .\n`` We do n't want to be a burden to our children , '' says Allan Sugarman , 71 , of Morganville , N.J. Mr. Sugarman and his wife , Joyce , bought long-term-care policies from John Hancock about a decade ago after hearing that a friend had paid more than $ 100,000 to support his father in an assisted-living facility . They later learned another friend 's disabled mother was sleeping on her son 's sofa , for lack of an affordable alternative .\nThe couple are paying $ 6,380 a year for the two policies . They want to keep their coverage so much that Ms. Sugarman says she was relieved when Hancock let them avoid a double-digit rate increase by sacrificing part of an inflation-protection perk .\nSome regulators are making it tough for insurers to bump up premiums to a sustainable level , contributing to the decision by some companies to leave the market . Last year , a Pennsylvania state-court judge faulted the state 's insurance department for not approving big premium increases for two troubled insurers .\n`` This case presents a serious indictment of the existing system of rate regulation of long-term-care insurance , '' Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt wrote .
