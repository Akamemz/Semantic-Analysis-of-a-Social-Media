    "content": "Hi , everybody . This week , I went down to an Amazon warehouse in Tennessee to talk more about what we need to do to secure a better bargain for the middle class \u2013 to make sure that anyone who works hard can get ahead in the 21st century economy .\nOver the past four and a half years , we \u2019 ve fought our way back from the worst recession of our lifetimes and begun to lay a foundation for stronger , more durable economic growth . Today , our businesses have created 7.3 million new jobs over the last 41 months . We now sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before . Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years , and our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years .\nBut as any middle-class family will tell you , we \u2019 re not where we need to be yet . Even before the crisis hit , we were living through a decade where a few at the top were doing better and better , while most families were working harder and harder just to get by .\nReversing this trend must be Washington \u2019 s highest priority . It \u2019 s certainly mine . But too often over the past two years , Washington has taken its eye off the ball . They \u2019 ve allowed an endless parade of political posturing and phony scandals to distract from growing our economy and strengthening the middle class .\nThat \u2019 s why I \u2019 m laying out my ideas for how we can build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America . A good education . A home of your own . Health care when you get sick . A secure retirement even if you \u2019 re not rich . And the most important cornerstone of all : a good job in a durable , growing industry .\nWhen it comes to creating more good jobs that pay decent wages , the problem is not a lack of ideas . Plenty of independent economists , business owners and people from both parties agree on what we have to do . I proposed many of these ideas two years ago in the American Jobs Act . And this week , I put forward common-sense proposals for how we can create more jobs in manufacturing ; in wind , solar and natural gas ; and by rebuilding America \u2019 s infrastructure .\nWhat we \u2019 re lacking is action from Washington . And that \u2019 s why , in addition to proposing ideas that we know will grow our economy , I \u2019 ve also put forward a strategy for breaking through the Washington logjam \u2013 a \u201c grand bargain \u201d for the middle class .\nI \u2019 m willing to work with Republicans to simplify our tax code for businesses large and small , but only if we take the money we save by transitioning to a simpler tax system and make a significant investment in creating good , middle-class jobs . We can put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our infrastructure . We can boost manufacturing , so more American companies can sell their products around the world . And we can help our community colleges arm our workers with the skills they need in a global economy \u2013 all without adding a dime to the deficit .\nI \u2019 ll keep laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot in the 21st century , and I \u2019 ll keep reaching out to Republicans for theirs . But gutting critical investments in our future and threatening national default on the bills that Congress has already racked up \u2013 that \u2019 s not an economic plan . Denying health care to millions of Americans , or shutting down the government just because I \u2019 m for keeping it open \u2013 that won \u2019 t help the middle class .\nThe truth is , there are no gimmicks when it comes to creating jobs . There are no tricks to grow the economy . Reversing the long erosion of middle-class security in this country won \u2019 t be easy . But if we work together and take a few bold steps \u2013 and if Washington is willing to set aside politics and focus on what really matters \u2013 we can grow our economy and give the middle class a better bargain .
