The Government Accountability Office notes that it costs the government $ 4,000 to conduct a background check for a top-secret clearance , but only $ 260 for a secret clearance .\nIn 2012 , the GAO reported that the Defense Department and other agencies \u201c will continue to risk making security clearance determinations that are inconsistent or at improper levels \u201d because of there is no single set of guidelines to determine who gets or doesn \u2019 t get a clearance .\nThe office of the director of national intelligence ( DNI ) was supposed to set up unified standards , but had not when the GAO report was issued .\n\u201c The process has not been completed yet , \u201d DNI spokesman Gene Barlow said Tuesday , adding that the agency is working on one guideline .\nSecurity at the Navy Yard and within the Defense Department emerged as key issues in the aftermath of Monday \u2019 s shooting spree in which 12 civilian workers were slain at the naval facility in Southeast Washington .\nCiting a Pentagon inspector general report , Rep. Michael R. Turner , Ohio Republican and a key member of the House Committee on Armed Services , said the Navy Yard \u2019 s security system was installed to cut costs and may be flawed .\n\u201c I am highly concerned that the access control systems at our nation \u2019 s military installations have serious security flaws , \u201d Mr. Turner , chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on tactical air and land forces , said in a letter Monday to acting Pentagon Inspector General Lynne Halbrooks .\nIn addition , D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray said he wondered whether budget cuts had something to do with a gunman getting onto the base .\n\u201c As I look at , for example , sequestration , which is about saving money in the federal government being spent , have we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk ? \u201d Mr. Gray said Tuesday on CNN \u2019 s \u201c New Day . \u201d\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel plans to order a review of physical security and access at all U.S. defense installations worldwide , a senior Pentagon official said on background .\nMr. Hagel was collecting input from senior leaders Tuesday to define the parameters of the review , which could be announced as early as Wednesday .\nThe move follows Navy Secretary Ray Mabus \u2019 decision to direct a \u201c rapid review \u201d of Navy and Marine Corps security procedures at military bases in the U.S. by Oct. 1 .\nAlexis was one of about 4.8 million government and contractor employees who hold some type of security clearance . The main designations are confidential , secret , top secret , and top secret , special compartmented information .\nAlexis \u2018 secret clearance is more restrictive than a top-secret designation , which allows the holder wider access into the nation \u2019 s classified world .\nA secret clearance can be issued within a week or a few months .\nIn conducting a security clearance background check , the government requires an applicant \u2019 s Social Security number and address , and examines the person \u2019 s credit history and work experience going back 10 years . It also requires at least three character references and three work references from a manager and co-workers .\nInvestigators would have been required to check Alexis \u2018 military and criminal records , but his honorable discharge would have weighed heavily in his favor in obtaining a clearance .

He enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 2007 .\nThe Pentagon relied on his secret clearance when he left the Navy in 2011 and began working as a contractor in the defense industry , a defense official said late Tuesday . There was no re-investigation , so he continued to hold the clearance as a computer technician based on background checks conducted in 2007 .\n\u201c Mr . Alexis was initially granted eligibility as a Navy reservist , \u201d the official said on background . \u201c In accordance with national reciprocity standards , his eligibility was reciprocally accepted when he moved to Industry .
