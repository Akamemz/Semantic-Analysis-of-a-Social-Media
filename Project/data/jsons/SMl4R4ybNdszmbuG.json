That \u2019 s what Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler are telling us , and it \u2019 s all because Donald Trump and Bill Barr are refusing to submit to House subpoenas .\nNever mind that Trump allowed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to interview everyone he wanted , without asserting executive privilege , and that everything you might want to know about the administration is out there in Mueller \u2019 s report . ( It \u2019 s not always pretty . ) Never mind that , when the shoe was on the other foot , Obama ruled by decree and Eric Holder didn \u2019 t want to talk about Fast and Furious .\nSo even by Democratic standards , it sounds pretty hysterical . But there is a quiet constitutional crisis that \u2019 s happening , underneath all the noise .\nWe \u2019 ve got a constitution with a separation of powers which assumes that people can work together . That \u2019 s supposed to ensure that bad policies will be screened away and that only good policies will be enacted . But when one party refuses to work with the other , nothing gets enacted . That \u2019 s supposed eventually to bring both sides to the table , and in the past that \u2019 s what always happened . Except for that one time , in 1861 .\nNow it \u2019 s happening again . It \u2019 s not like 1995 , when Bill Clinton could turn on a dime and work with Newt Gingrich , or 2001 when George W. Bush got along with Teddy Kennedy . This time it looks more permanent . If Trump is Hitler and the dictator Nadler is warning us about , then you don \u2019 t expect to see any deals getting cut .\nWhat \u2019 s different today is the Democrats have bought into the idea of \u201c no enemies on the left , \u201d which means they \u2019 re prisoners of the most radical people on their fringes . They hang out with Louis Farrakhan , and we \u2019 re still waiting for them to condemn the Antifa rioters . In 1992 Bill Clinton cut loose anti-white racist Sister Souljah , but since then identity politics and racism have gone mainstream in the Party and we don \u2019 t see any Sister Souljah Moments from them today .\nLike children playing with fire , they \u2019 ve bought into ideas that put them far outside the mainstream , and they \u2019 re several standard deviations to the left of where they used to be . Bill Clinton thought that abortion should be \u201c safe , legal and rare , \u201d but that \u2019 s not where the present party is . We \u2019 ll see you later-term abortions , and raise you infanticide , says Gov . Ralph Northam . The very woke Beto O \u2019 Rourke seeks the blessing of Al Sharpton and endorses racial reparations . As for the green new deal , if the world is going to end in 12 years , it \u2019 s whoopee time and anything goes .\nThat \u2019 s not a crisis , however . That \u2019 s just lunacy , and it \u2019 s something the voters can correct . Where you have a crisis is where one party kisses goodbye to the most fundamental understanding about our system of government . Things like the idea that the winner of the Electoral College is the duly elected president , that there \u2019 s something special about American citizenship , something not shared with non-citizens . Or simply the idea that Americans should be proud of their country . When all of that is out the window , when one party no longer thinks that our form of government is legitimate because it \u2019 s undemocratic , because abortion rights aren \u2019 t protected and because Republicans sometimes win , then you have a constitutional crisis .\nSo should we get worked up about that ? No . It \u2019 s like that 1914 Austrian telegram : \u201c situation grave but not serious. \u201d It \u2019 s only serious if you take Jerry Nadler and AOC seriously , and you won \u2019 t do that if you \u2019 ve preserved your sense of humor .\nWhen one party goes so far off the rails , the best strategy for the other party is to be the only adult in the room . Admittedly , Donald Trump hasn \u2019 t always helped , but if the Republicans stick to Trump \u2019 s policies , the ones that explain the Revolution of 2016 , that constitutional crisis is going to fizzle out .\nAmerica \u2019 s creed is liberalism , the traditionally Democratic idea that freedom is better than repression , that free markets beat socialism , that we don \u2019 t prefer one set of people on the basis of their race or religion , that free speech trumps censorship , that our government should provide an economy with jobs for everyone who can work and a generous safety net for those who can \u2019 t .
