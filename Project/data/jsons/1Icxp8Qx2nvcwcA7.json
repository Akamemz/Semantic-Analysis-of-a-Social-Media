    "content": "Remember when the Left tried to drive Rush Limbaugh off the air seven years ago after he called Sandra Fluke a \u201c slut \u201d ? Oh my , how they salivated as they got some advertisers to withdraw ads from Rush \u2019 s show ! They thought they had Rush off the air . They really did . Carbonite , the computer-data back-up company , made a big splash when they announced they were pulling their ads off Rush . But Rush stuck it out . He stayed strong . And , like the Energizer Bunny , all these years later he still is going and going and going , while history records that Fluke was a fluke . And Carbonite \u2019 s stock value nose-dived .\nYes , it was right for Fox to dissociate from Bill O \u2019 Reilly . What can one say ? All those many high-ticket legal settlements with women \u2014 too many . That was not about politics or about left-wing pressure , even though the revelations emanated from the New York Times Left . Our society just can not abide that .\nBut then the Left came after Sean Hannity . Remember that one , when he backed Roy Moore against the Democrat in the Alabama race for U.S. Senate ? And they got Keurig to pull some ads ? Remember ? That stopped pretty fast when the media was swamped with images of Hannity fans smashing their $ 100-plus Keurig coffee machines . Some of those tweets got more than two million views . It even got to the point that Sean went on TV and appealed to his viewers to stop smashing their coffee machines .\nNext the Left tried to take down Laura Ingraham when she tweeted something perfectly legitimate about a narcissistic loud-mouthed kid at the Florida high school where the mass shooting took place . They tried to drive her off the air by pressuring her sponsors to abandon her or face withering boycotts . She withstood the onslaught , and Fox stood by her . She continues to run the best news-commentary show on television , hands down .\nAnd now they want Tucker Carlson \u2019 s much-admired scalp . The Left came up with some offensive stuff he said on a shock-jock radio show ten or so years ago . They smelled blood , but it now seems clear that Fox News is going to stand by him . They better \u2014 otherwise , they may as well shift over to CNN/MSNBC Leftism because they will not have any of their current viewers left if they bail on Tucker . And then they likewise may as well switch their \u201c Fox Nation \u201d streaming thing to a 24/7 \u201c Acme Hour \u201d cartoon station .\nIn this utterly bifurcated society that now lives for character assassination and \u201c gotcha ! \u201d destruction , as witness what was done even to Kevin Hart before the Oscars , many of us are numb to the point of no longer giving a darn regarding what garbage they dig up . We are so utterly sick of the double standard . Al Sharpton has a TV show on MSNBC , and yet that fraud promoted the Tawana Brawley circus and defamation . He even got convicted of defamation in a court of law . How many Americans get to experience that honor in a lifetime ? Moreover , Sharpton personally played a role in inciting not one but two anti-Jewish pogroms \u2014 one in Crown Heights , Brooklyn , and one at Freddie \u2019 s , a store in Harlem . There were street riots and deaths . Does anyone on the Left care ? No ?\nJimmy Kimmel wore blackface , spoke in comical antebellum \u201c Shuffling Negro dialect , \u201d was remarkably gross in his public depiction of women \u2014 all in the years before he got himself an ABC nighttime gig . Does anyone on the Left care ? No ? So we don \u2019 t care what you dig up on Tucker . How \u2019 s that ?\nThey care about Rush calling Fluke a \u201c slut \u201d after she publicly asked you and me to pay for her contraception . What better noun describes a woman who says publicly to an entire nation : \u201c I want you to pay for my acts of physical coitus \u201d ? And when Laura rightly calls out a teen who does not control the world , they demand her head . And when Jeffrey Lord legitimately tweets a sarcastic \u201c Sieg Heil ! \u201d to someone at Media Matters trying to push him around , they remove him from CNN . And when Tucker goes off color and off script on a shock-jock radio show during a time and place a decade before he ever imagined being a serious talk-show host , they become appalled . Well , they all are full of baloney , double standards , and \u2014 as Nancy Pelosi might say \u2014 they are \u201c not worth it . \u201d\nThere are two sides of the powerhouse media now : The Wall Street Journal editorial page and Fox News ( except for Shepard Smith , whose presence there remains the great conundrum of the Modern Age ) on one side , versus the rest of the mainstream Mediacracy on the Left \u2014 CBS , NBC , ABC , MSNBC , PBS , CNN , New York Times , Washington Post . Yet the power of Fox is reflected in the Democrats \u2019 decision not to let Bret Baier , Chris Wallace , and Martha McCallum conduct a single debate among the Democrat primaries . And that is fine indeed . Alas , Fox News is going ballistic over it . All their talk-show hosts seem assigned to complain about the shutout every night . Chris Wallace presses his Sunday guests and panel about it . They trot out Juan Williams to say that no one at Fox ever censors him .\nBut frankly , my dear , the rest of us do not give a darn . If we want to watch a Democrat debate , we know how to find it . Obviously , Fox \u2019 s concern is that they want to be treated seriously as a bona fide news organization . Well , they are . They are more fair and balanced , even in commentary and certainly in their news division , than are any of the many , many shills for the Left . One way that Fox viewers know they are fair and balanced is that we all tune out or mute the volume so often daily as we encounter screechy Jessica Tarlov , or see the face of Chris Hahn or Richard Goodstein about to expel air . It is the \u201c Fox Thumb Twitch \u201d by which we mute the sound as soon as we see Juan Williams \u2019 s or Geraldo Rivera \u2019 s lips start moving , then twitch back to sound to hear Mark Steyn or Dan Bongino , then twitch back to mute as some Democrat shill or Leftist stooge gets on , then back to sound as that former ICE director guy or even Dershowitz gets started . Twitch , twitch .\nFox is as fair-and-balanced as today \u2019 s climate allows . CNN is a joke ; I watch it only one night every two years \u2014 election night on even-numbered years \u2014 because I like the way John King analyzes the votes precinct by precinct . Otherwise , a complete waste . All their panelists either are shills for the Left or are these pseudo-Republicans who are so bad \u2014 so incredibly , repulsively , indigestibly bad \u2014 that one is left with either of two assumptions regarding those \u201c Never Trumpers \u201d :\nEither these Ana fingernail-filing Navarros are phony and never-ever-in-their-lives-not-even-for-one-minute were Republicans ever-ever in their lives but , as with \u201c professional wrestling , \u201d are paid extra to play the \u201c bad guy \u201d for entertainment , so that the \u201c good guys \u201d have someone to wrestle ; Or a creep like Navarro actually was a Republican with Jeb Bush , and that reinforces definitively why we voted for Trump , to throw out the whole rotted bunch of phony-baloney RINOs , to get them all out \u2014 the Jennifer Rubins and George Wills and Ana Navarros and the whole bunch of them , yellow bananas that went mushy-spoiled-brown within hours of Trump \u2019 s election , all who have revealed that they would rather have had Hillary naming Supreme Court justices and filling federal judicial vacancies and conducting the economy and healthcare and energy policy and veterans affairs and trade deals and higher-education policy and foreign affairs and setting the national tone in terms of gender and culture .\nSo now the Democrats want to protect their snowflake candidates from being questioned by real reporters when they instead can have Donna Brazile Wannabes passing along batting-practice questions like :\n\u201c Vice President Biden , what was it like to know Barack Obama so intimately ? \u201d\n\u201c Senator Warren , what is your favorite beer , and can you do a Rain Dance ? \u201d\n\u201c Senator Harris , what was Willie Brown like in bed ? Uh , I mean : What is your favorite brand of weed ? \u201d\n\u201c Senator O \u2019 Rourke , how does that title sound , and did you end up having any cavities ? \u201d\n\u201c Senator Klobuchar , what is the longest distance you ever have thrown a binder ? \u201d\n\u201c Senator Gillibrand , how do you stay so up-to-date so that you never are more than ten minutes behind the pack in changing your positions on any issue ? \u201d\nIn this season of madness , the message for Fox News is \u201c Stand By Your Man \u201d \u2014 whether it be Tucker or Sean or women like Laura , Martha , and Shannon . Don \u2019 t worry about not airing a Democrat debate . Let them get comfortable answering fluffy questions . But learn from this that your brand strength and viewer loyalty and corporate profits will not depend on Tom Perez but on how your stand by your core hosts .\nAnd one more lesson : When the Presidential debates start between President Trump and his Democrat opponent , Trump \u2019 s team must learn from the way that CNN \u2019 s Candy Crowley ambushed Mitt Romney and from the way that Tom Perez blacked out Fox . This round the Trump team must refuse absolutely to participate in any debate on any station until they carefully have approved the panel for neutrality and fairness . Any proposed panelist with the slightest tinge of bias \u2014 not just Acosta and Mourning Joe , but even the Jake Tappers and Lester Holts and that woman who cried on the air when Trump won in 2016 \u2014 must be deemed as utterly unacceptable .
