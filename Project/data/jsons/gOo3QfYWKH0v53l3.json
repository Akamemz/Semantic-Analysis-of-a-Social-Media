Photo by Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou\nThe night that Donald Trump won the presidential election , technology executive John Gable was having dinner with his family . Ordinarily , Gable would host a party at his house with finger foods and drinks on election night , an event that he liked to refer to as \u201c The Superbowl of politics. \u201d But this year the family stayed in . Gable was too nervous about the results to socialize .\nMidway through his meal , he was unable to keep still any longer . Gable excused himself and rushed to the living room to check the results . He nervously flipped between MSNBC and Fox News . Still chewing on his rosemary beef stew , he heard polling database FiftyThiryEight give Trump a 78 percent chance of winning . Gable felt relieved .\n\u201c I was convinced that things were going to be the same or a little worse with Clinton and under Trump I could see they could be better , \u201d the 51-year old said . \u201c He is going to change things . \u201d\nIn the weeks since Donald Trump won the presidential election , the tech industry has been grappling with shock , anger , and uncertainty . In recent years , Silicon Valley has enjoyed a particularly close relationship with President Barack Obama , who visited the Valley many times , invited tech executives to the White House and even created the U.S. Chief Technology Officer role , the first ever tech job for the government .\nBut the industry \u2019 s relationship with Trump has been rockier . Trump threatened to boycott Apple when the tech giant didn \u2019 t follow an F.B.I . order earlier this year to unlock the San Bernardino shooter \u2019 s iPhone . He attacked Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos , accusing him of using the newspaper as a tax dodge . He also accused Google of hiding negative news about Hillary Clinton in its search engine .\nWhile Silicon Valley has its libertarian Republican supporters , Trump \u2019 s racist , sexist and controversial comments pushed many of them to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s side . In July , more than 140 tech industry leaders , executives , analysts and experts signed a letter outlining the reasons why a Trump presidency would be \u201c a disaster for innovation. \u201d According to Crowdpac , a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations , tech employees and executives gave a total of $ 8.1 million to candidates . Of that , 95 percent , or $ 7.7 million , went to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign . Donald Trump received about $ 300,000 dollars , or 4 percent , and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received less than 1 percent .\nSilicon Valley has good reason to be afraid of how a Trump presidency will impact them given the fraught exchanges during the campaign . But some like Gable are looking forward to the new regime . They believe that Trump \u2019 s outsider status will challenge the traditional establishment in Washington .\nIn the months leading up to the election , Peter Thiel , the billionaire venture capitalist and Facebook board member , travelled the country to convince voters to look past Donald Trump \u2019 s flaws and vote for him in order to challenge the establishment and break Washington \u2019 s status quo .\n\u201c We \u2019 re voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of our country to have failed , \u201d Thiel said in a press conference at the National Press Club .\n\u201c Donald Trump scares Democrats and Republicans , \u201d said the CEO of All Sides , a website that collects and compares headlines from the left , right and center to create a discussion around different perspectives . \u201c He is more likely to make a more radical change in Washington D.C. than anyone else . \u201d\nGable said he also believes that Trump will come up with economic policies that are favorable to the tech industry .\n\u201c I always thought of him as the art of the deal , because he is comfortable making deals , \u201d said Gable . \u201c I like some of his economic ideas . Others I don \u2019 t . But I do think that things are going to be different . \u201d\nSo far , the president-elect has said he wants to de-regulate the market and has vowed to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act , a financial regulation plan that was put in place following the 2008 economic collapse .\nTrump supporters in the technology industry are also excited about his plan to lower corporate taxes , which could boost earnings .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the only thing that Silicon Valley possibly likes , \u201d said Tim Bajarin , president of Creative Strategies , a market research firm in Silicon Valley .\nWall Street also appears to be buoyed by the prospect of Trump \u2019 s market friendly policy proposals . The Dow increased by nearly 600 points in the three days after Trump \u2019 s victory . Stocks of financial companies in the S & P 500 jumped about 11 percent in the week after the election .\nTo be certain , not all of Trump \u2019 s economic policy agenda would be helpful to the industry . He has threatened to impose tariffs on foreign products entering the U.S. , and he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement , a trade deal involving 11 countries in the Pacific region . Trump has argued that the agreement could hurt American workers and undermine U.S. companies , but critics worry about triggering a trade war .\n\u201c It could force retaliation from the other countries to then put tariffs on U.S. goods going into their countries , \u201d Bajarin said .\nTrump also plans to impose tariffs on companies that move production overseas . His critics believe this could hurt companies like Apple or Intel , which manufacture their products in countries with cheaper labor , like China .\nBut one Google employee , who declined to be named and identifies as a conservative , said he agreed with Trump \u2019 s policy .\n\u201c I think that it \u2019 s good that he wants companies to produce more consumer goods in the United States , \u201d he said , adding that it could actually help improve the companies \u2019 brand image .\nMuch has been made by Trump \u2019 s extreme comments during the campaign . In his speeches , he threatened to deport immigrants , ban Muslims from entering the country , and planned on building a wall in the border with Mexico . But Trump \u2019 s Silicon Valley supporters said that the comments weren \u2019 t meant to be taken literally .

He is not Ted Cruz . He is not some hardcore religious conservative , \u201d the aforementioned Google employee said . \u201c For the first time in a long time the Valley should be able to feel like they can talk to a Republican administration sort of on equal footing . \u201d\nAs Silicon Valley prepares for the unanticipated political reality , tech executives are hoping that \u2019 s true . They are trying to find ways to connect with the new administration . Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates called Donald Trump after the election and congratulated him on his win . Google announced a job posting for a manager of \u201c conservative outreach. \u201d Trump has responded by inviting leaders from some of the biggest tech companies to New York for a round-table discussion , according to The New York Times .\nIn the meantime , Trump supporters say they hope that the election will puncture the Silicon Valley \u2019 s cultural bubble and will help bridge the disconnect with the rest of America . They hope that the election result could be the wake-up call that Silicon Valley needed to understand the changing reality in the U.S .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a real question of ignorance on our part , \u201d said Richard Walker , professor emeritus of geography at University of California , Berkeley , who focuses on economic and political trends in the state . \u201c People in the Bay Area have no idea what life is like for a lot of people , how long that \u2019 s been the case and they haven \u2019 t been concerned about that . \u201d\nRepublicans say they hope that those attitude changes will also bring an acceptance of their beliefs .
