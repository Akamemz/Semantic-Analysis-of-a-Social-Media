    "content": "That was Sonia Rodriguez \u2019 s first thought when her fianc\u00e9 called her from federal prison near Cleveland . The gravelly voice she had known since high school had turned into a wheeze . He could barely finish a sentence without pausing to catch his breath . He said he was coughing up blood .\nRodriguez , a 49-year-old who handles accounting at a bakery , knew she was taking on a lot when she reconnected with JJ\u2014officially Johnny Joe Desilva Jr.\u2014while he was serving time . She knew his past involvement in gangs and drug trafficking would make the road to married life long .\nBut now she feared she would lose her strong fianc\u00e9 to sickness . To COVID-19 . While he was in the federal government \u2019 s care .\n\u201c He asked if I knew how much he loved me , \u201d she said , crying as she remembered . \u201c I thought I would get a call from him the next day . \u201d\nThe coronavirus had arrived at the Elkton Federal Correctional Institution , where , as one prisoner put it , there were suddenly \u201c people walking around looking like the living dead . \u201d\nWith over 163,000 people in custody , the federal Bureau of Prisons is America \u2019 s largest jailer . The BOP touts its prisons as \u201c safe , humane , cost-efficient , and appropriately secure. \u201d But what happened at Elkton is typical in many ways of the grim conditions and bungled responses at federal lockups across the country . The agency confirms active cases at 69 of its 122 prisons . As of Wednesday , it reported at least 6,245 prisoners and 673 staff infected over the course of the pandemic at its prisons and halfway houses .\nAnd the truth is much worse than the BOP \u2019 s official numbers indicate .\nVICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke with more than 85 federal prisoners or their family members , and 25 staff members at prisons with coronavirus outbreaks . We obtained dozens of internal BOP memos , emails , and other documents , and reviewed images and videos recorded on contraband cell phones .\nWe found that the BOP was unprepared for the pandemic and slow to respond , and that top officials even took measures that contributed to the spread of the virus .\nThe official death toll stands at 86 , including one staff member . Our reporting on the BOP \u2019 s handling of the coronavirus outbreak shows :\nStaff ignored or minimized prisoners \u2019 COVID-19 symptoms , and mixed the sick and healthy together in haphazard quarantines .\nThousands of prisoners were shipped around the country in February and early March , taking the virus with them , according to BOP records obtained by VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nCorrectional officers and other staff felt pressured to work even after being exposed to sick prisoners .\nThe BOP failed to follow its own pandemic response plan , which called for spacing out prisoners . Photos and videos show sick men in bunk beds just two feet apart .\nFederal officials have allegedly tried to conceal the extent of the outbreak by limiting testing\u2014so that they didn \u2019 t have to report positive cases\u2014and refusing to recognize one staff death . As of Tuesday , they had completed testing on less than 13 percent of prisoners in BOP-run facilities .\nPrisoners reported being quarantined in filthy buildings that had been vacant for years or in tents that flooded during rainstorms . Some described listening to their friends dying around them .\nBOP Director Michael Carvajal declined an interview request from VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Elkton \u2019 s warden referred us to the BOP main office . A spokesperson sent a statement in response to a detailed list of questions , declining to comment on numerous allegations involving specific prisoners , and maintaining that the agency \u2019 s response to the pandemic was carefully planned and coordinated , and that it took an array of precautions to contain the outbreak .\n\u201c We are deeply concerned for the health and welfare of those inmates who are entrusted to our care , and for our staff , their families , and the communities we live and work in , \u201d the statement said . \u201c It is our highest priority to continue to do everything we can to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our facilities . \u201d\nAttorney General William Barr has twice issued orders to release medically vulnerable prisoners or move them to home confinement , but the Justice Department has nonetheless fought to keep the vast majority of them incarcerated . Less than 3 percent of federal prisoners have been sent to home confinement , and some of them\u2014including former Trump allies Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen\u2014didn \u2019 t even meet the official criteria to qualify .\nThe BOP \u2019 s handling of the crisis under Barr and Carvajal has drawn scrutiny from Congress , with lawmakers questioning how the outbreak spiraled out of control and how the agency spent $ 100 million allotted to it for pandemic response . The inspector general for the Justice Department is investigating .\nRep. Jerrold Nadler , a Democrat from New York , slammed the Justice Department in a recent committee hearing , saying , \u201c At best , it has slow-walked its response to COVID-19 . At worst , they have been derelict in their duty to prevent deaths in the facilities that they operate . \u201d\nBut the most furious criticism has come from the BOP \u2019 s rank and file . The American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals , which represents over 30,000 federal prison workers , has lambasted Carvajal and the BOP leadership during the pandemic .\n\u201c They 're making it worse , \u201d said Joe Rojas , the union \u2019 s Southeast regional vice president . \u201c They 're making the virus explode instead of containing it . \u201d\nThe BOP counts one correctional officer \u2019 s death from COVID-19 . But the parents of another staffer say the agency is refusing to acknowledge that the virus also caused their daughter \u2019 s death . The union has sued for hazard pay and filed at least two workplace safety complaints alleging that staff were exposed to infection without being given protective gear .\nPrisoners have filed at least 11 class-action lawsuits against Carvajal and wardens to try to compel releases and improve conditions . At Elkton , a federal judge ordered officials to move or release hundreds of medically vulnerable prisoners . That would not only protect those who got out but also allow better social distancing for those who remain behind bars . Two men involved in the case died from COVID-19 while the government appealed .\nFor many during the pandemic , the only way out of federal prison has been in an ambulance .\nThe BOP says its response to the pandemic began in January . According to records shared with VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the paper trail begins with a two-page memo to the agency \u2019 s health staff on January 31 , describing what little was known at the time about the virus and its symptoms . It advised anyone who had recently traveled to China to undergo screening .\nThe agency had no permanent leader when the outbreak began\u2014an interim director had been in charge since scandal erupted over the prison death of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in August 2019 . On February 25 , the attorney general gave the job to Michael Carvajal . A U.S. Army veteran who started off as a corrections officer in 1992 , Carvajal rose through the ranks to become a warden and eventually a senior official in Washington , D.C. , where his job included emergency planning .\nFour days after Carvajal took over , the agency issued another memo that warned \u201c the virus is likely to cause a pandemic. \u201d The memo called for increased screening of staff and prisoners , distribution of personal protection equipment , and other basic preparations .\nThe BOP stopped allowing visitors at prisons on March 13 as the seriousness of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak became apparent . The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a federal lockup was recorded the week after , at a detention center in Brooklyn .\nAt Elkton , the staff grew frustrated as prisoners started to get sick . Joseph Mayle , a counselor at Elkton and the local union chief , said that initially there wasn \u2019 t clear guidance from headquarters to contain the disease\u2014it was up to the warden and union staff to figure out how to respond .\n\u201c It took two or three weeks to finally do anything , \u201d Mayle said . \u201c There was no across-the-board \u2018 This is what everyone needs to be doing here. \u2019 It \u2019 s a crock of shit. \u201d He says there are still no rules to prevent officers from moving between quarantine areas and uninfected housing units . ( The BOP said , \u201c As much as possible , staff are being assigned to the same posts and not rotating . \u201d )\nBy late March , JJ Desilva had been ill for days . He told his fianc\u00e9e the medical staff at Elkton said it was just the flu and gave him some ibuprofen , but he knew something was wrong when he drank Gatorade and couldn \u2019 t taste it . Then came the uncontrollable coughing .\nHe told Sonia they moved him on March 28 to a hastily set-up quarantine unit . He didn \u2019 t have access to the prison email system there and , for the first few days , no way to call home . When he was finally allowed to use the phone , he told Rodriguez that he was with 70 coughing , sweating men crammed onto cots in what was normally the visitation room .\nA BOP spokesperson said \u201c all symptomatic inmates are treated per CDC guidelines , \u201d and \u201c all institutions have areas set aside for quarantining and isolation . \u201d\nThe sickest people at Elkton and other federal prisons have ended up in community hospitals . That \u2019 s what happened to Desilva , who the day after his April 1 conversation with Rodriguez was moved to an intensive care unit in a nearby hospital and put on a ventilator .\nCase in Point An examination of a single case that sheds light on the criminal justice system\nNobody told her . The next day , prisoners started dying at Elkton .\nThe first was Woodrow Taylor , a 53-year-old from Cincinnati serving five years on a nonviolent drug conviction . According to the BOP , his condition \u201c quickly declined \u201d and he died in a hospital . Two men followed him within the next 24 hours .\nElkton holds about 2,300 men at two prisons in the same compound . Both are considered low-security and have open , dormitory-style housing . Two or three beds are stacked in cubicles that measure about 80 square feet , with low walls and no door . There \u2019 s room for only one person at a time to stand up .\nThat setup is typical for low-security federal prisons , making them excellent incubators for COVID-19 . The BOP has been aware of the risk for years . After the MERS coronavirus outbreak in 2012 , the agency created a \u201c Pandemic Influenza Plan . \u201d\n\u201c In large dorm settings or camps , isolation may not be a possibility , \u201d the BOP plan states . \u201c If isolation is not feasible , attempt to place the beds of sick inmates at a distance of at least 6 feet from other inmates . \u201d\nCOVID-19 afflicted federal prisons across the country . Yazoo City , Mississippi Danbury , Connecticut Glenville , West Virginia ( Gilmer ) Fort Worth , Texas ( Medical Center ) Sumter County , Florida ( Coleman ) El Paso , Texas ( La Tuna ) Tallahassee , Florida Fairton , New Jersey Prisoners complained about poor medical care , haphazard quarantines and not enough testing ; under 10 percent of prisoners at the complex were tested , BOP data shows . \u201c We were just locked in the cell for 72 hours straight , \u201d one prisoner wrote . \u201c Then they would let us out of our cells for 15 minutes , literally , to shower , call home , clean our cells . Fifteen minutes every three days. \u201d The prison may say it took care of people , he added , \u201c but , man , that is such a damn lie. \u201d The bureau declined to comment on the allegations or specific conditions of confinement , citing safety and prisoner privacy . At the women \u2019 s camp , some prisoners said they were quarantined in the mess hall or visitation room , where they slept on cots with no access to heat , clean clothes , or fresh air for more than two weeks . Officials \u201c said that since we wan na complain about it , we \u2019 re staying here extra time , \u201d said Esther Arias , who was released last week after more than a decade behind bars . The prison complex , which faces a COVID-related lawsuit in federal court , did not respond to a request for comment . The warden at one point refused to continue testing prisoners for fear too many would be positive \u201c and it \u2019 ll look bad , \u201d said Derek Crihfield , president of the correction officers union local . Gilmer is one of a handful of quarantine sites intended to house people entering the prison system until they could be cleared as COVID-free . A prison system spokesman said the facility had been testing all incoming prisoners , and following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control . Prisoners and their families described half-hearted attempts to separate the sick and the well , and increasing tension inside the units as they watched officials put up unexplained emergency tents outside and saw their friends falling ill inside . Staff say they are doing everything they can in the circumstances , though the prison did not respond to a request for comment . But a 79-year-old prisoner wrote in a motion for release that the medical center \u201c is now nothing more than a de facto Death Row for elderly and sick offenders . This facility is literally God \u2019 s waiting room. \u201d When coronavirus hit , some women at the camp were still reeling from a Legionnaires \u2019 outbreak last year . According to a prisoner \u2019 s husband , Coleman officials sent some people suspected of having COVID-19 to solitary\u2014which for women meant confinement in the men \u2019 s facility . Some people who had been exposed were mixed in dorms with others who hadn \u2019 t , the woman \u2019 s husband said : \u201c It \u2019 s just a cruel punishment to have them stuck in these conditions. \u201d Though the prison complex , the largest in the nation , reported few cases , the union said that was because of limited testing . A bureau spokesman said that women and men were not housed in the same units but would not provide details on specific housing conditions due to security reasons . The prison was \u201c not even close \u201d to being able to keep men six feet apart , one prisoner wrote . Those showing symptoms were typically put in solitary confinement , so men stood on chairs in front of air conditioning vents to cool their heads and hide any fever . \u201c To die in a hospital , alone , is tragic , \u201d the prisoner wrote . \u201c To die in solitary confinement , alone , inhumane. \u201d The prison did not respond to a request for comment . Prisoners described the facility as overcrowded and unsanitary , with a leaking roof and visible mold . Some women slept with their heads 6 inches away from other prisoners , inmates wrote in a court filing . \u201c To be blunt , FCI-Tallahassee is a filthy rundown prison before the pandemic . It is a fair statement , not hyperbole , to say FCI-Tallahassee 's medical care is inadequate in normal conditions and non-existent during the pandemic. \u201d The prison did not respond to our questions . Prisoners were banned from going outside and locked in their crowded dorms where it was impossible to practice social distancing . In the mess hall , they were told to stay 6 feet apart , even though their bunks back in the dorm were barely 12 inches from each other . \u201c They \u2019 re like sardines , \u201d one prisoner \u2019 s mother said . Her son \u201c could touch like four guys just by leaning over. \u201d The prison did not respond to our questions .\nA cell phone video posted April 3 on Facebook by an Elkton prisoner , Aaron Campbell , showed men packed together in their cubicles , sleeping and wheezing . After the post went viral , Campbell said in a letter to VICE News that he was sent to \u201c the hole \u201d as punishment for having a contraband phone . He claimed officials told him he would not face additional discipline if he issued a statement saying the video was fake . He refused .\n\u201c Instead of trying to help these people , they are covering it up and trying to control the public \u2019 s perception of the situation here at Elkton , \u201d Campbell wrote from solitary confinement , where he said he was still being held nearly two months later . The BOP and Elkton did not respond to questions about Campbell \u2019 s allegations .\nNearly 20 percent of federal prisoners are over 50 , including about 10,000 older than 60\u2014the demographic most vulnerable to COVID-19 . The sickest and oldest tend to be grouped in low-security prisons like Elkton , minimum-security \u201c camps , \u201d or medical centers . Much like nursing homes in the free world , these prisons have become death traps during the outbreak .\nMany behind bars have underlying medical conditions exacerbated by years of poor health care . The most recent oversight report on medical staffing , in 2016 , raised red flags about systemwide shortages of BOP doctors and nurses , including 12 prisons that had \u201c crisis \u201d levels . At Elkton , a state medical official who visited in early April told Ohio \u2019 s governor that staffing at the prison was \u201c only 50 percent of what it should be . \u201d\nAn Elkton staffing report from April 2020 , obtained by VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 , shows the only two paramedics \u2019 jobs and two nursing roles were vacant . Thirty-one other positions were unfilled across the prison , including three counselors , whose duties include making early-release recommendations and coordinating lawyer calls and visits . Mayle , the local union chief at Elkton , said counselors have seen caseloads double from 150 to 300 prisoners per worker in recent years .\nAmid budget cuts and a temporary hiring freeze under President Trump , the BOP has lost more than 4,600 employees\u2014about 12 percent of its total staff\u2014including correctional officers , psychologists , and administrators . The shortage means medical staff are forced to take guard shifts in addition to performing their normal duties .\nPrisoners say that during the pandemic , they became de facto nurses\u2014with no training or protective gear\u2014caring for men \u201c going in and out of consciousness , throwing up , trembling , cold sweats , fever , spitting up blood when they cough , \u201d as one prisoner at Elkton wrote in a letter to VICE News .\nMichael Bear , a 67-year-old imprisoned at Elkton for drug and gun convictions , said he was coughing and feeling miserable when he saw a doctor there in late March .\n\u201c He took my temperature and my vitals and said I was n't sick , \u201d Bear recalled . \u201c He told me to get the hell out of the clinic and then not come back . \u201d\nBear later collapsed and had a seizure . He wasn \u2019 t isolated until nearly a week later . A day later , he was sent to the hospital .\nHe spent 24 days in a medically-induced coma . He said he remembers one dream from that time : He could see his dead wife , and wanted to be with her .\nWhile Bear was in a coma , Rodriguez was desperately trying to get updates on her fianc\u00e9 .\nLife Inside Essays by people in prison and others who have experience with the criminal justice system\nWas JJ too ill to pick up the phone ? , she wondered . Was he in a hospital ? Or had he simply been moved to a place where he couldn \u2019 t make calls ?\nShe had learned not to expect easy answers to such questions .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a number ; he \u2019 s not a human , \u201d she said . \u201c The prison doesn \u2019 t care . \u201d\nWhen Rodriguez \u2019 s phone finally rang two days after Desilva \u2019 s last call , it was a prison nurse bearing the bad news that he was on a ventilator . But the woman on the other end of the phone wouldn \u2019 t tell her where he was or give any more information on his condition .\nRodriguez understood that the prison couldn \u2019 t direct her to the hospital where he was\u2014corrections officials often consider that information a security risk . So she and Desilva \u2019 s family frantically mounted a search , scouring Facebook for staff at medical centers near Elkton . They made call after call , as Rodriguez tried to find the man she had known for more than three decades .\nThe two had met in East Moline , Illinois . He was her high school crush , but they \u2019 d gone separate ways . \u201c Life happened , \u201d as she put it . For Rodriguez , that meant working as a school secretary and raising kids with her first husband .\nDesilva became involved in the Latin Kings gang , selling drugs and feuding with rivals in conflicts that sometimes turned violent . He did a brief stint in prison for bank fraud in the mid- \u2019 90s and was released , only to be re-arrested in 2004 and convicted on federal charges including drug trafficking , threatening to kidnap someone , and carrying an illegal firearm .\nShe contacted him on a whim in 2018 , she said . He had almost two decades left on his sentence . They started exchanging letters and talking on the phone . They picked up exactly where they \u2019 d been as teens , she said , but both a little wiser .\n\u201c I knew what he had been involved in , \u201d she said , \u201c but I figured after 20-some years in prison he can \u2019 t be the same person. \u201d He remembered her so well , down to the lilac dress she \u2019 d worn to a quincea\u00f1era nearly 25 years earlier .\n\u201c Clearly his feelings were so real , that this stood out to him after all this time , \u201d she said .\nSoon , every month she was driving eight hours to see him . Before long , he proposed , getting down on one knee in the middle of the visiting room .\nIt was one of Desilva \u2019 s relatives who found the clue to his hospital : a Facebook post from a healthcare worker in East Liverpool , Ohio , about 15 miles south of Elkton , grumbling about an influx of patients from the local prison .\nA relative called the hospital and got connected to his room , but the person who answered would not confirm that Desilva was there . Later , Rodriguez said , a hospital representative called back and apologized , but said she \u2019 d have to contact the prison for details about his condition .\nRodriguez said she spent the next four weeks pestering and cajoling medical professionals , chaplains , and prison staff into sharing crumbs of information .\n\u201c Every day you wake up to the same thing , not knowing if he \u2019 s OK , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s a nightmare . \u201d\nThe Next To Die A detailed , up-to-date schedule of upcoming executions in the United States\nAt one point she found out he \u2019 d been put on dialysis\u2014but nothing more . She heard he was scheduled to come out of sedation , then got no updates for days . The Elkton union chief said staff tried to provide updates as often as possible to family members of hospitalized prisoners , but to Rodriguez the stretches of days with no word felt cruel .\nBy April 6 , the situation at Elkton had grown so dire that Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine deployed the National Guard , sending military medical personnel to provide support . At the time , the BOP had only confirmed eight prisoners and one staff staff member at Elkton with COVID-19 .\nThe union told a different story , reporting that 37 men at Elkton were hospitalized . An additional 71 were in isolation with severe symptoms . Three staff members were sick , and others who had been exposed were still coming to work .\nAll over the country , from Oakdale in Louisiana to Danbury in Connecticut to Butner in North Carolina , federal prisons were facing the same problem : a rapidly spreading disease and no coherent strategy to contain it .\nOfficers are told to self-quarantine if exposed , but there were barely enough workers to keep the prisons running before coronavirus . And until late April , staying home meant taking sick leave , which is limited . The BOP still has not organized testing for the staff going in and out , even at hot spots like Elkton .\nOn April 11 , BOP Director Carvajal gave his first\u2014and so far , only\u2014interview about the coronavirus crisis unfolding in his prison system . He told CNN that his first few weeks on the job in February had been \u201c quite overwhelming \u201d but that overall he was pleased with his work .\n`` I do n't think anybody was ready for this COVID , \u201d Carvajal said . \u201c So we 're dealing with it just as well as anybody else , and I 'd be proud to say we 're doing pretty good . ''\nIn February and early March , while the outbreak was gaining steam , records show over 10,000 people flying through the federal transfer center in Oklahoma City , a main transit hub , on the way to other prisons .\nCarvajal ordered a halt to prisoner movement on March 13 , but there \u2019 s evidence that they were still being shipped around the country well into April .\nNew prisoners kept arriving at Elkton , even as the death toll reached nine . According to workers , new inmates were continually sent to Elkton throughout March and April .\nRecords obtained by VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 show nearly 70 prisoners being transported by plane in late April . Smaller groups were being flown almost weekly .\n\u201c We are moving inmates in such a high volume , we have airlifts , buses , going out\u2014the movement is just so much , \u201d Anthony Sanon , union president at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn , said in early April .\nA BOP spokesperson said prisoner movement nationwide was down 95 percent from March 13 to April 23 compared with the same period last year . The issue is partly beyond the BOP \u2019 s control : Federal courts have continued to pump more people into the system .\nBut the agency formally resumed transfers in late May , announcing plans to move 6,800 recently sentenced people from temporary detention centers into prisons in order to \u201c alleviate population pressures . \u201d\nA new \u201c guidance \u201d document obtained by VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 says that prisoners are supposed to be tested and strictly quarantined during travel . But Sandra Parr , a national union official , says sick people have already been pushed out the door : \u201c They \u2019 re shoving Tylenol and Motrin in \u2019 em so they don \u2019 t have a fever , then putting them on a plane . \u201d\nA union official at the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Texas filed a whistleblower complaint on April 7 , alleging that the BOP \u201c knowingly misleads the American public \u201d about the movement of federal prisoners during the pandemic . The complaint followed the arrival on March 20 of a woman who tested positive for COVID-19 . Andrea Circle Bear was almost nine months pregnant ; she gave birth by emergency C-section while on a ventilator . Circle Bear died on April 28 . Her baby survived and is living with a grandparent .\nBecome a Member Join the community that keeps criminal justice on the front page .\nCarvajal later testified that the agency reviewed the cases of over 30 pregnant women in federal custody and transferred 24 to \u201c community confinement. \u201d The others , he said , \u201c weren \u2019 t eligible or appropriate \u201d to serve out their sentences at home .\nThe continued transfers had lethal consequences at the Grady County Jail , a small lockup in Chickasha , Oklahoma , that has a contract with the U.S . Marshals Service to house overflow federal prisoners , typically for a few days or weeks at a time . The conditions there were ripe for an outbreak , as dozens of men were packed into a dorm with stacked bunk beds , no hot water , and no access to the outdoors or sunlight for weeks . One prisoner at Grady\u2014activist and hacker Jeremy Hammond\u2014reported that by the end of April half of his dorm had fallen ill. \u201c Basically , they don \u2019 t give a fuck about us , \u201d he said . A federal prisoner died there from COVID-19 on April 28 . A BOP spokesperson referred questions to the U.S . Marshals Service , which said it \u201c does not own or operate \u201d Grady and other private detention centers . The jail did not respond to a request for comment . Joshua Lepird , president of the union at the Oklahoma City transfer center , which is about 30 miles northeast of Grady , estimated that more than half of his facility \u2019 s 52 confirmed COVID-19 cases in early June were people who \u2019 d been transferred from the jail . He blamed an intentional lack of testing across the system . \u201c Here 's the truth : They don \u2019 t want to know how many positive inmates they have , \u201d he said . \u201c The numbers are higher than they \u2019 re admitting . \u201d\nThe first federal prisoner to die during the pandemic was still reporting to work at the prison factory in Oakdale , Louisiana , when he collapsed in late March . Patrick Jones , 49 , was serving time on a nonviolent drug conviction . Prisoners at Oakdale say Jones was sent back into their dorm-style housing unit while he was sick , causing the virus to spread . A BOP spokesperson said the allegations about Jones could not be verified .\nMany of the BOP factories kept operating , paying workers between 23 cents and $ 1.15 an hour . Eventually , some were repurposed to make cloth face masks\u2014even though at first prisoners were not allowed to wear masks while they worked .\nCarvajal has touted the masks as an example of the agency \u2019 s swift and effective response to the outbreak . Several videos on the agency \u2019 s website open with him wearing a blue surgical mask , which he removes as he begins speaking . The mask , he says in one , came from a women \u2019 s prison in Minnesota .\nBut photos of other masks sent to VICE News and \u2588\u2588\u2588 by both staff and prisoners show a different product , with haphazard stitching and threadbare white fabric . Several correctional officers said it resembled the material used to make prisoners \u2019 boxer shorts . \u201c I would n't put that thing on my dog , \u201d one fumed .\nThe BOP says N95 respirator masks and other protective equipment for staff was stockpiled before the pandemic , but some officers said they couldn \u2019 t get the equipment when they needed it . In April , at least four prisons in the Southeast ended up with Chinese KN-95s that staff said appeared to not meet federal safety standards .\nAt the federal penitentiary in Atlanta , Robin Grubbs , a 39-year-old case manager , was worried about a quarantine unit that had been set up outside her office , according to her father , Gary Grubbs . \u201c They didn \u2019 t give her no mask or nothing like that , \u201d he said .\nShe didn \u2019 t show up for work on April 14 ; her coworkers found her unresponsive in her living room .\nA spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said an autopsy was not performed on Grubbs because she tested positive for COVID-19 , which was listed as the \u201c probable cause of death . \u201d\nHer father said he was told Wednesday that toxicology results showed she had no drugs in her system or other explanation for her sudden death . The GBI spokesperson confirmed the death from \u201c natural \u201d causes .\nGeorge Grubbs is certain his daughter got sick at work .\n`` The only place she went was home and her job , \u201d Grubbs said . \u201c We feel that it had to come from the prison . That \u2019 s the only place we know that she \u2019 d been around it . ''\nThe Clayton County Police Department in suburban Atlanta , which is investigating the death , provided an incident report stating there were \u201c no signs of foul play. \u201d A police spokesperson said \u201c the cause of death has not been made official . \u201d\nThe BOP said \u201c there is no evidence or information relating to a cause of death . \u201d\nKelvin Williams , the Atlanta union chief , said the agency doesn \u2019 t want to acknowledge Grubbs as a COVID-19 victim because it would be obligated to pay her family benefits . \u201c The bureau thinks about the long-term effect of admitting something like that has happened , \u201d Williams said . \u201c They try to downplay it as much as possible . \u201d\nWhile Desilva was on a ventilator at the hospital for much of April , prisoners at Elkton said they were allowed out of their housing units for just a few minutes each day , including for trips to the mess hall . The rush for food triggered stampedes .\nThe Record The best criminal justice reporting from around the web , organized by subject\nMore and more fell ill and were wheeled out on gurneys . At the peak , according to court records and Elkton staff , 46 prisoners were hospitalized , with 18 on ventilators .\n\u201c As far as I can tell , they ended up taking about one in every five out of here , \u201d Donald Schlittenhardt , a 54-year-old Elkton prisoner , wrote on April 9 of his unit . \u201c That puts your odds no better than playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter . \u201d\nSchlittenhardt , who uses a wheelchair and is serving 20 years on a drug conviction , said officers with pepper spray were summoned when he confronted medical staff in early April about not doing regular temperature checks and ignoring sick prisoners .\nMayle , the staff union president , described the encounter as an \u201c isolated incident with a few disgruntled inmates who did not want to go into isolation . \u201d\nSchlittenhardt and two other prisoners also said officers threatened them with tear gas and pepper spray when they objected to having to eat lunch outside in 40-degree weather while their housing unit was being disinfected .\nIt \u2019 s not just Elkton . At prisons across the country , men and women who were sick or had been exposed to COVID-19 reported being held in horrifying conditions . And because the entire BOP system was in lockdown , even prisoners who were not ailing were confined to their bunks or cells , and some didn \u2019 t see sunlight for weeks .\nAt the minimum-security camp in Lompoc , California , prisoners say they were ordered to pick up one man who collapsed because the officers were afraid of touching him . The prisoners said medics didn \u2019 t arrive for about two hours . The BOP said it could not respond to the specific allegation , but that its staff respond to medical emergencies immediately .\nMeanwhile , sick men were isolated in a mothballed section of the prison that had previously been used as \u201c the hole . \u201d\nOne prisoner there\u2014who said he \u2019 d already been dealing with untreated cancer for a year\u2014reported receiving only one hot meal a day and showering just once in 18 days . He could hear men coughing into the common area through their cell bars , and said he listened as the guards rushed to one prisoner \u2019 s cell and said he was \u201c gone . \u201d\n\u201c I can \u2019 t even believe this is happening in the United States , \u201d he said . \u201c It was like watching a horror movie. \u201d A BOP spokesperson said only one of Lompoc \u2019 s four deaths from COVID-19 actually occurred at the prison itself ; the others were in the hospital .\nBut more than 93 percent of the people inside the low-security prison contracted the virus .\nOn April 28 , Rodriguez got the call she \u2019 d been hoping for : \u201c Hey , gorda , \u201d the familiar deep voice growled . \u201c How are you guys ? \u201d\nDesilva still sounded weak\u2014but he was finally out of the hospital .\n\u201c I know this changed him , \u201d she said . \u201c He said the nurses were surprised he made it ; he was on the verge of dying . \u201d\nWe Are Witnesses Intimate portraits of people who have been touched by the criminal justice system\nBut her fianc\u00e9 was now in isolation , still without regular phone or email access . Eventually he \u2019 d be sent back to a dorm packed with other men . Like many prisoners , he asked for compassionate release . Like most of them , he has not yet gotten it .\nChanging policies and internal agency opposition to releases have kept many behind bars . Lashonda Hall , serving 43 years at the prison in Tallahassee for a nonviolent drug crime , called her family to tell them she was being released to home confinement . When staff came back and told her there \u2019 d been a mix-up and she hadn \u2019 t served enough of her time , she couldn \u2019 t bring herself to let her family know .\n\u201c COVID-19 does not care how much of your sentence you have done , \u201d she said .\nBernd Appleby , a 68-year-old prisoner serving two years for a white-collar tech crime , was initially told he didn \u2019 t qualify for release because of a minor disciplinary infraction , according to his wife . During the Super Bowl , he bet on the losing team and had to make good afterward : He owed a single ice cream sandwich . When he mentioned it in an email to a friend , he got written up for gambling .\nAt Elkton , Alvin Turner , a 43-year-old from Michigan serving time for a nonviolent drug charge , petitioned the courts to be sent home early , bolstering his case with a letter from prison staff saying he had taught financial literacy to more than 60 people . The BOP announced his death from COVID-19 on April 13 .\nThe day of Turner \u2019 s death , the ACLU sued Carvajal and Warden Mark Williams , arguing that conditions at Elkton violate the Eighth Amendment \u2019 s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment . Prisoners gave sworn declarations describing \u201c complete chaos , \u201d \u201c ambulances leaving at all hours , \u201d and feeling like they \u2019 d been handed death sentences .\nFederal Judge James Gwin has sided repeatedly with the prisoners at Elkton , ordering the BOP to swiftly release or transfer 837 people who \u2019 d been identified as medically vulnerable .\nAfter prison officials declared that only five people met the criteria , Gwin issued a blistering ruling that said Williams and Carvajal were \u201c thumbing their nose at their authority to authorize home confinement \u201d and risking the lives of both staff and prisoners in the process .\nThe government first appealed to the Supreme Court , which declined to hear the case , then got the lower court \u2019 s ruling overturned by the Sixth Circuit\u2014a decision that dims the prospects of success for similar claims at other federal prisons .\nBOP officials continue to maintain that releases are unnecessary and the situation at Elkton is under control .\nMayle , the Elkton union president , defended the staff \u2019 s handling of the outbreak .\n\u201c We followed CDC guidelines and did everything in our power to ensure the health and safety of staff and inmates , \u201d Mayle said . \u201c I believe the ball was dropped \u201d by higher-ups , he added .\nAs of June 8 , according to the Elkton union , nine prisoners remained hospitalized , including four on ventilators . Mass testing revealed 749 confirmed positive cases , including 505 held in isolation because they are symptomatic or otherwise known to be infected . More than 50 staff members have tested positive . The death toll still stands at nine .\nMore than two months after he started coughing , Desilva still struggles . He has congestive heart failure and painful swelling in his legs and feet , which landed him in the hospital again briefly in late May . The long-term effects of COVID-19 are still unknown , but he and Rodriguez suspect it \u2019 s the cause of his health problems .\nThey have a lawyer working on a compassionate release request , which notes his plan to marry Rodriguez . But it \u2019 s not clear whether prisoners who \u2019 ve already had the virus would qualify . In the meantime , Desilva is worried about being moved to a prison farther away from his fianc\u00e9e , and he \u2019 s haunted by dreams of his blurry days in the hospital .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard for him to get sleep . And when he does , he has nightmares , \u201d Rodriguez said . \u201c He wakes up screaming or crying . \u201d\nCorrection : An earlier version misidentified U.S. District Judge James Gwin .\nThis story was updated to include additional information from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations .",
    "content_original": "Coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, criminal justice and immigration.\n\nHe sounded like he was dying.\n\nThat was Sonia Rodriguez\u2019s first thought when her fianc\u00e9 called her from federal prison near Cleveland. The gravelly voice she had known since high school had turned into a wheeze. He could barely finish a sentence without pausing to catch his breath. He said he was coughing up blood.\n\nRodriguez, a 49-year-old who handles accounting at a bakery, knew she was taking on a lot when she reconnected with JJ\u2014officially Johnny Joe Desilva Jr.\u2014while he was serving time. She knew his past involvement in gangs and drug trafficking would make the road to married life long.\n\nBut now she feared she would lose her strong fianc\u00e9 to sickness. To COVID-19. While he was in the federal government\u2019s care.\n\n\u201cHe asked if I knew how much he loved me,\u201d she said, crying as she remembered. \u201cI thought I would get a call from him the next day.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t. It was as if he had vanished.\n\nThe coronavirus had arrived at the Elkton Federal Correctional Institution, where, as one prisoner put it, there were suddenly \u201cpeople walking around looking like the living dead.\u201d\n\nWith over 163,000 people in custody, the federal Bureau of Prisons is America\u2019s largest jailer. The BOP touts its prisons as \u201csafe, humane, cost-efficient, and appropriately secure.\u201d But what happened at Elkton is typical in many ways of the grim conditions and bungled responses at federal lockups across the country. The agency confirms active cases at 69 of its 122 prisons. As of Wednesday, it reported at least 6,245 prisoners and 673 staff infected over the course of the pandemic at its prisons and halfway houses.\n\nAnd the truth is much worse than the BOP\u2019s official numbers indicate.\n\nVICE News and The Marshall Project spoke with more than 85 federal prisoners or their family members, and 25 staff members at prisons with coronavirus outbreaks. We obtained dozens of internal BOP memos, emails, and other documents, and reviewed images and videos recorded on contraband cell phones.\n\nWe found that the BOP was unprepared for the pandemic and slow to respond, and that top officials even took measures that contributed to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe official death toll stands at 86, including one staff member. Our reporting on the BOP\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak shows:\n\nStaff ignored or minimized prisoners\u2019 COVID-19 symptoms, and mixed the sick and healthy together in haphazard quarantines.\n\nThousands of prisoners were shipped around the country in February and early March, taking the virus with them, according to BOP records obtained by VICE News and The Marshall Project.\n\nCorrectional officers and other staff felt pressured to work even after being exposed to sick prisoners.\n\nThe BOP failed to follow its own pandemic response plan, which called for spacing out prisoners. Photos and videos show sick men in bunk beds just two feet apart.\n\nFederal officials have allegedly tried to conceal the extent of the outbreak by limiting testing\u2014so that they didn\u2019t have to report positive cases\u2014and refusing to recognize one staff death. As of Tuesday, they had completed testing on less than 13 percent of prisoners in BOP-run facilities.\n\nPrisoners reported being quarantined in filthy buildings that had been vacant for years or in tents that flooded during rainstorms. Some described listening to their friends dying around them.\n\nBOP Director Michael Carvajal declined an interview request from VICE News and The Marshall Project. Elkton\u2019s warden referred us to the BOP main office. A spokesperson sent a statement in response to a detailed list of questions, declining to comment on numerous allegations involving specific prisoners, and maintaining that the agency\u2019s response to the pandemic was carefully planned and coordinated, and that it took an array of precautions to contain the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned for the health and welfare of those inmates who are entrusted to our care, and for our staff, their families, and the communities we live and work in,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is our highest priority to continue to do everything we can to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our facilities.\u201d\n\nAttorney General William Barr has twice issued orders to release medically vulnerable prisoners or move them to home confinement, but the Justice Department has nonetheless fought to keep the vast majority of them incarcerated. Less than 3 percent of federal prisoners have been sent to home confinement, and some of them\u2014including former Trump allies Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen\u2014didn\u2019t even meet the official criteria to qualify.\n\nThe BOP\u2019s handling of the crisis under Barr and Carvajal has drawn scrutiny from Congress, with lawmakers questioning how the outbreak spiraled out of control and how the agency spent $100 million allotted to it for pandemic response. The inspector general for the Justice Department is investigating.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat from New York, slammed the Justice Department in a recent committee hearing, saying, \u201cAt best, it has slow-walked its response to COVID-19. At worst, they have been derelict in their duty to prevent deaths in the facilities that they operate.\u201d\n\nBut the most furious criticism has come from the BOP\u2019s rank and file. The American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals, which represents over 30,000 federal prison workers, has lambasted Carvajal and the BOP leadership during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThey're making it worse,\u201d said Joe Rojas, the union\u2019s Southeast regional vice president. \u201cThey're making the virus explode instead of containing it.\u201d\n\nThe BOP counts one correctional officer\u2019s death from COVID-19. But the parents of another staffer say the agency is refusing to acknowledge that the virus also caused their daughter\u2019s death. The union has sued for hazard pay and filed at least two workplace safety complaints alleging that staff were exposed to infection without being given protective gear.\n\nPrisoners have filed at least 11 class-action lawsuits against Carvajal and wardens to try to compel releases and improve conditions. At Elkton, a federal judge ordered officials to move or release hundreds of medically vulnerable prisoners. That would not only protect those who got out but also allow better social distancing for those who remain behind bars. Two men involved in the case died from COVID-19 while the government appealed.\n\nFor many during the pandemic, the only way out of federal prison has been in an ambulance.\n\n\u201cI begged them to let me die\u201d\n\nThe BOP says its response to the pandemic began in January. According to records shared with VICE News and The Marshall Project, the paper trail begins with a two-page memo to the agency\u2019s health staff on January 31, describing what little was known at the time about the virus and its symptoms. It advised anyone who had recently traveled to China to undergo screening.\n\nThe agency had no permanent leader when the outbreak began\u2014an interim director had been in charge since scandal erupted over the prison death of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in August 2019. On February 25, the attorney general gave the job to Michael Carvajal. A U.S. Army veteran who started off as a corrections officer in 1992, Carvajal rose through the ranks to become a warden and eventually a senior official in Washington, D.C., where his job included emergency planning.\n\nFour days after Carvajal took over, the agency issued another memo that warned \u201cthe virus is likely to cause a pandemic.\u201d The memo called for increased screening of staff and prisoners, distribution of personal protection equipment, and other basic preparations.\n\nThe BOP stopped allowing visitors at prisons on March 13 as the seriousness of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak became apparent. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a federal lockup was recorded the week after, at a detention center in Brooklyn.\n\nAt Elkton, the staff grew frustrated as prisoners started to get sick. Joseph Mayle, a counselor at Elkton and the local union chief, said that initially there wasn\u2019t clear guidance from headquarters to contain the disease\u2014it was up to the warden and union staff to figure out how to respond.\n\n\u201cIt took two or three weeks to finally do anything,\u201d Mayle said. \u201cThere was no across-the-board \u2018This is what everyone needs to be doing here.\u2019 It\u2019s a crock of shit.\u201d He says there are still no rules to prevent officers from moving between quarantine areas and uninfected housing units. (The BOP said, \u201cAs much as possible, staff are being assigned to the same posts and not rotating.\u201d)\n\nBy late March, JJ Desilva had been ill for days. He told his fianc\u00e9e the medical staff at Elkton said it was just the flu and gave him some ibuprofen, but he knew something was wrong when he drank Gatorade and couldn\u2019t taste it. Then came the uncontrollable coughing.\n\nHe told Sonia they moved him on March 28 to a hastily set-up quarantine unit. He didn\u2019t have access to the prison email system there and, for the first few days, no way to call home. When he was finally allowed to use the phone, he told Rodriguez that he was with 70 coughing, sweating men crammed onto cots in what was normally the visitation room.\n\nA BOP spokesperson said \u201call symptomatic inmates are treated per CDC guidelines,\u201d and \u201call institutions have areas set aside for quarantining and isolation.\u201d\n\nThe sickest people at Elkton and other federal prisons have ended up in community hospitals. That\u2019s what happened to Desilva, who the day after his April 1 conversation with Rodriguez was moved to an intensive care unit in a nearby hospital and put on a ventilator.\n\nCase in Point An examination of a single case that sheds light on the criminal justice system\n\nNobody told her. The next day, prisoners started dying at Elkton.\n\nThe first was Woodrow Taylor, a 53-year-old from Cincinnati serving five years on a nonviolent drug conviction. According to the BOP, his condition \u201cquickly declined\u201d and he died in a hospital. Two men followed him within the next 24 hours.\n\nElkton holds about 2,300 men at two prisons in the same compound. Both are considered low-security and have open, dormitory-style housing. Two or three beds are stacked in cubicles that measure about 80 square feet, with low walls and no door. There\u2019s room for only one person at a time to stand up.\n\nThat setup is typical for low-security federal prisons, making them excellent incubators for COVID-19. The BOP has been aware of the risk for years. After the MERS coronavirus outbreak in 2012, the agency created a \u201cPandemic Influenza Plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn large dorm settings or camps, isolation may not be a possibility,\u201d the BOP plan states. \u201cIf isolation is not feasible, attempt to place the beds of sick inmates at a distance of at least 6 feet from other inmates.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 afflicted federal prisons across the country. Yazoo City, Mississippi Danbury, Connecticut Glenville, West Virginia (Gilmer) Fort Worth, Texas (Medical Center) Sumter County, Florida (Coleman) El Paso, Texas (La Tuna) Tallahassee, Florida Fairton, New Jersey Prisoners complained about poor medical care, haphazard quarantines and not enough testing; under 10 percent of prisoners at the complex were tested, BOP data shows. \u201cWe were just locked in the cell for 72 hours straight,\u201d one prisoner wrote. \u201cThen they would let us out of our cells for 15 minutes, literally, to shower, call home, clean our cells. Fifteen minutes every three days.\u201d The prison may say it took care of people, he added, \u201cbut, man, that is such a damn lie.\u201d The bureau declined to comment on the allegations or specific conditions of confinement, citing safety and prisoner privacy. At the women\u2019s camp, some prisoners said they were quarantined in the mess hall or visitation room, where they slept on cots with no access to heat, clean clothes, or fresh air for more than two weeks. Officials \u201csaid that since we wanna complain about it, we\u2019re staying here extra time,\u201d said Esther Arias, who was released last week after more than a decade behind bars. The prison complex, which faces a COVID-related lawsuit in federal court, did not respond to a request for comment. The warden at one point refused to continue testing prisoners for fear too many would be positive \u201cand it\u2019ll look bad,\u201d said Derek Crihfield, president of the correction officers union local. Gilmer is one of a handful of quarantine sites intended to house people entering the prison system until they could be cleared as COVID-free. A prison system spokesman said the facility had been testing all incoming prisoners, and following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. Prisoners and their families described half-hearted attempts to separate the sick and the well, and increasing tension inside the units as they watched officials put up unexplained emergency tents outside and saw their friends falling ill inside. Staff say they are doing everything they can in the circumstances, though the prison did not respond to a request for comment. But a 79-year-old prisoner wrote in a motion for release that the medical center \u201cis now nothing more than a de facto Death Row for elderly and sick offenders. This facility is literally God\u2019s waiting room.\u201d When coronavirus hit, some women at the camp were still reeling from a Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak last year. According to a prisoner\u2019s husband, Coleman officials sent some people suspected of having COVID-19 to solitary\u2014which for women meant confinement in the men\u2019s facility. Some people who had been exposed were mixed in dorms with others who hadn\u2019t, the woman\u2019s husband said: \u201cIt\u2019s just a cruel punishment to have them stuck in these conditions.\u201d Though the prison complex, the largest in the nation, reported few cases, the union said that was because of limited testing. A bureau spokesman said that women and men were not housed in the same units but would not provide details on specific housing conditions due to security reasons. The prison was \u201cnot even close\u201d to being able to keep men six feet apart, one prisoner wrote. Those showing symptoms were typically put in solitary confinement, so men stood on chairs in front of air conditioning vents to cool their heads and hide any fever. \u201cTo die in a hospital, alone, is tragic,\u201d the prisoner wrote. \u201cTo die in solitary confinement, alone, inhumane.\u201d The prison did not respond to a request for comment. Prisoners described the facility as overcrowded and unsanitary, with a leaking roof and visible mold. Some women slept with their heads 6 inches away from other prisoners, inmates wrote in a court filing. \u201cTo be blunt, FCI-Tallahassee is a filthy rundown prison before the pandemic. It is a fair statement, not hyperbole, to say FCI-Tallahassee's medical care is inadequate in normal conditions and non-existent during the pandemic.\u201d The prison did not respond to our questions. Prisoners were banned from going outside and locked in their crowded dorms where it was impossible to practice social distancing. In the mess hall, they were told to stay 6 feet apart, even though their bunks back in the dorm were barely 12 inches from each other. \u201cThey\u2019re like sardines,\u201d one prisoner\u2019s mother said. Her son \u201ccould touch like four guys just by leaning over.\u201d The prison did not respond to our questions.\n\nA cell phone video posted April 3 on Facebook by an Elkton prisoner, Aaron Campbell, showed men packed together in their cubicles, sleeping and wheezing. After the post went viral, Campbell said in a letter to VICE News that he was sent to \u201cthe hole\u201d as punishment for having a contraband phone. He claimed officials told him he would not face additional discipline if he issued a statement saying the video was fake. He refused.\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to help these people, they are covering it up and trying to control the public\u2019s perception of the situation here at Elkton,\u201d Campbell wrote from solitary confinement, where he said he was still being held nearly two months later. The BOP and Elkton did not respond to questions about Campbell\u2019s allegations.\n\nNearly 20 percent of federal prisoners are over 50, including about 10,000 older than 60\u2014the demographic most vulnerable to COVID-19. The sickest and oldest tend to be grouped in low-security prisons like Elkton, minimum-security \u201ccamps,\u201d or medical centers. Much like nursing homes in the free world, these prisons have become death traps during the outbreak.\n\nMany behind bars have underlying medical conditions exacerbated by years of poor health care. The most recent oversight report on medical staffing, in 2016, raised red flags about systemwide shortages of BOP doctors and nurses, including 12 prisons that had \u201ccrisis\u201d levels. At Elkton, a state medical official who visited in early April told Ohio\u2019s governor that staffing at the prison was \u201conly 50 percent of what it should be.\u201d\n\nAn Elkton staffing report from April 2020, obtained by VICE News and The Marshall Project, shows the only two paramedics\u2019 jobs and two nursing roles were vacant. Thirty-one other positions were unfilled across the prison, including three counselors, whose duties include making early-release recommendations and coordinating lawyer calls and visits. Mayle, the local union chief at Elkton, said counselors have seen caseloads double from 150 to 300 prisoners per worker in recent years.\n\nAmid budget cuts and a temporary hiring freeze under President Trump, the BOP has lost more than 4,600 employees\u2014about 12 percent of its total staff\u2014including correctional officers, psychologists, and administrators. The shortage means medical staff are forced to take guard shifts in addition to performing their normal duties.\n\nPrisoners say that during the pandemic, they became de facto nurses\u2014with no training or protective gear\u2014caring for men \u201cgoing in and out of consciousness, throwing up, trembling, cold sweats, fever, spitting up blood when they cough,\u201d as one prisoner at Elkton wrote in a letter to VICE News.\n\nMichael Bear, a 67-year-old imprisoned at Elkton for drug and gun convictions, said he was coughing and feeling miserable when he saw a doctor there in late March.\n\n\u201cHe took my temperature and my vitals and said I wasn't sick,\u201d Bear recalled. \u201cHe told me to get the hell out of the clinic and then not come back.\u201d\n\nBear later collapsed and had a seizure. He wasn\u2019t isolated until nearly a week later. A day later, he was sent to the hospital.\n\nHe spent 24 days in a medically-induced coma. He said he remembers one dream from that time: He could see his dead wife, and wanted to be with her.\n\n\u201cI begged them to let me die.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a number; not a human\u201d\n\nWhile Bear was in a coma, Rodriguez was desperately trying to get updates on her fianc\u00e9.\n\nLife Inside Essays by people in prison and others who have experience with the criminal justice system\n\nWas JJ too ill to pick up the phone?, she wondered. Was he in a hospital? Or had he simply been moved to a place where he couldn\u2019t make calls?\n\nShe had learned not to expect easy answers to such questions.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a number; he\u2019s not a human,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prison doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nWhen Rodriguez\u2019s phone finally rang two days after Desilva\u2019s last call, it was a prison nurse bearing the bad news that he was on a ventilator. But the woman on the other end of the phone wouldn\u2019t tell her where he was or give any more information on his condition.\n\nRodriguez understood that the prison couldn\u2019t direct her to the hospital where he was\u2014corrections officials often consider that information a security risk. So she and Desilva\u2019s family frantically mounted a search, scouring Facebook for staff at medical centers near Elkton. They made call after call, as Rodriguez tried to find the man she had known for more than three decades.\n\nThe two had met in East Moline, Illinois. He was her high school crush, but they\u2019d gone separate ways. \u201cLife happened,\u201d as she put it. For Rodriguez, that meant working as a school secretary and raising kids with her first husband.\n\nDesilva became involved in the Latin Kings gang, selling drugs and feuding with rivals in conflicts that sometimes turned violent. He did a brief stint in prison for bank fraud in the mid-\u201990s and was released, only to be re-arrested in 2004 and convicted on federal charges including drug trafficking, threatening to kidnap someone, and carrying an illegal firearm.\n\nShe contacted him on a whim in 2018, she said. He had almost two decades left on his sentence. They started exchanging letters and talking on the phone. They picked up exactly where they\u2019d been as teens, she said, but both a little wiser.\n\n\u201cI knew what he had been involved in,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I figured after 20-some years in prison he can\u2019t be the same person.\u201d He remembered her so well, down to the lilac dress she\u2019d worn to a quincea\u00f1era nearly 25 years earlier.\n\n\u201cClearly his feelings were so real, that this stood out to him after all this time,\u201d she said.\n\nSoon, every month she was driving eight hours to see him. Before long, he proposed, getting down on one knee in the middle of the visiting room.\n\nIt was one of Desilva\u2019s relatives who found the clue to his hospital: a Facebook post from a healthcare worker in East Liverpool, Ohio, about 15 miles south of Elkton, grumbling about an influx of patients from the local prison.\n\nA relative called the hospital and got connected to his room, but the person who answered would not confirm that Desilva was there. Later, Rodriguez said, a hospital representative called back and apologized, but said she\u2019d have to contact the prison for details about his condition.\n\nRodriguez said she spent the next four weeks pestering and cajoling medical professionals, chaplains, and prison staff into sharing crumbs of information.\n\n\u201cEvery day you wake up to the same thing, not knowing if he\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d\n\nThe Next To Die A detailed, up-to-date schedule of upcoming executions in the United States\n\nAt one point she found out he\u2019d been put on dialysis\u2014but nothing more. She heard he was scheduled to come out of sedation, then got no updates for days. The Elkton union chief said staff tried to provide updates as often as possible to family members of hospitalized prisoners, but to Rodriguez the stretches of days with no word felt cruel.\n\nBy April 6, the situation at Elkton had grown so dire that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine deployed the National Guard, sending military medical personnel to provide support. At the time, the BOP had only confirmed eight prisoners and one staff staff member at Elkton with COVID-19.\n\nThe union told a different story, reporting that 37 men at Elkton were hospitalized. An additional 71 were in isolation with severe symptoms. Three staff members were sick, and others who had been exposed were still coming to work.\n\n\u201dThe movement is just so much\u201d\n\nAll over the country, from Oakdale in Louisiana to Danbury in Connecticut to Butner in North Carolina, federal prisons were facing the same problem: a rapidly spreading disease and no coherent strategy to contain it.\n\nOfficers are told to self-quarantine if exposed, but there were barely enough workers to keep the prisons running before coronavirus. And until late April, staying home meant taking sick leave, which is limited. The BOP still has not organized testing for the staff going in and out, even at hot spots like Elkton.\n\nOn April 11, BOP Director Carvajal gave his first\u2014and so far, only\u2014interview about the coronavirus crisis unfolding in his prison system. He told CNN that his first few weeks on the job in February had been \u201cquite overwhelming\u201d but that overall he was pleased with his work.\n\n\"I don't think anybody was ready for this COVID,\u201d Carvajal said. \u201cSo we're dealing with it just as well as anybody else, and I'd be proud to say we're doing pretty good.\"\n\nIn February and early March, while the outbreak was gaining steam, records show over 10,000 people flying through the federal transfer center in Oklahoma City, a main transit hub, on the way to other prisons.\n\nCarvajal ordered a halt to prisoner movement on March 13, but there\u2019s evidence that they were still being shipped around the country well into April.\n\nNew prisoners kept arriving at Elkton, even as the death toll reached nine. According to workers, new inmates were continually sent to Elkton throughout March and April.\n\nRecords obtained by VICE News and The Marshall Project show nearly 70 prisoners being transported by plane in late April. Smaller groups were being flown almost weekly.\n\n\u201cWe are moving inmates in such a high volume, we have airlifts, buses, going out\u2014the movement is just so much,\u201d Anthony Sanon, union president at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, said in early April.\n\nA BOP spokesperson said prisoner movement nationwide was down 95 percent from March 13 to April 23 compared with the same period last year. The issue is partly beyond the BOP\u2019s control: Federal courts have continued to pump more people into the system.\n\nBut the agency formally resumed transfers in late May, announcing plans to move 6,800 recently sentenced people from temporary detention centers into prisons in order to \u201calleviate population pressures.\u201d\n\nA new \u201cguidance\u201d document obtained by VICE News and The Marshall Project says that prisoners are supposed to be tested and strictly quarantined during travel. But Sandra Parr, a national union official, says sick people have already been pushed out the door: \u201cThey\u2019re shoving Tylenol and Motrin in \u2019em so they don\u2019t have a fever, then putting them on a plane.\u201d\n\nA union official at the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Texas filed a whistleblower complaint on April 7, alleging that the BOP \u201cknowingly misleads the American public\u201d about the movement of federal prisoners during the pandemic. The complaint followed the arrival on March 20 of a woman who tested positive for COVID-19. Andrea Circle Bear was almost nine months pregnant; she gave birth by emergency C-section while on a ventilator. Circle Bear died on April 28. Her baby survived and is living with a grandparent.\n\nBecome a Member Join the community that keeps criminal justice on the front page.\n\nCarvajal later testified that the agency reviewed the cases of over 30 pregnant women in federal custody and transferred 24 to \u201ccommunity confinement.\u201d The others, he said, \u201cweren\u2019t eligible or appropriate\u201d to serve out their sentences at home.\n\nThe continued transfers had lethal consequences at the Grady County Jail, a small lockup in Chickasha, Oklahoma, that has a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service to house overflow federal prisoners, typically for a few days or weeks at a time. The conditions there were ripe for an outbreak, as dozens of men were packed into a dorm with stacked bunk beds, no hot water, and no access to the outdoors or sunlight for weeks. One prisoner at Grady\u2014activist and hacker Jeremy Hammond\u2014reported that by the end of April half of his dorm had fallen ill. \u201cBasically, they don\u2019t give a fuck about us,\u201d he said. A federal prisoner died there from COVID-19 on April 28. A BOP spokesperson referred questions to the U.S. Marshals Service, which said it \u201cdoes not own or operate\u201d Grady and other private detention centers. The jail did not respond to a request for comment. Joshua Lepird, president of the union at the Oklahoma City transfer center, which is about 30 miles northeast of Grady, estimated that more than half of his facility\u2019s 52 confirmed COVID-19 cases in early June were people who\u2019d been transferred from the jail. He blamed an intentional lack of testing across the system. \u201cHere's the truth: They don\u2019t want to know how many positive inmates they have,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers are higher than they\u2019re admitting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey try to downplay it as much as possible\u201d\n\nThe first federal prisoner to die during the pandemic was still reporting to work at the prison factory in Oakdale, Louisiana, when he collapsed in late March. Patrick Jones, 49, was serving time on a nonviolent drug conviction. Prisoners at Oakdale say Jones was sent back into their dorm-style housing unit while he was sick, causing the virus to spread. A BOP spokesperson said the allegations about Jones could not be verified.\n\nMany of the BOP factories kept operating, paying workers between 23 cents and $1.15 an hour. Eventually, some were repurposed to make cloth face masks\u2014even though at first prisoners were not allowed to wear masks while they worked.\n\nCarvajal has touted the masks as an example of the agency\u2019s swift and effective response to the outbreak. Several videos on the agency\u2019s website open with him wearing a blue surgical mask, which he removes as he begins speaking. The mask, he says in one, came from a women\u2019s prison in Minnesota.\n\nBut photos of other masks sent to VICE News and The Marshall Project by both staff and prisoners show a different product, with haphazard stitching and threadbare white fabric. Several correctional officers said it resembled the material used to make prisoners\u2019 boxer shorts. \u201cI wouldn't put that thing on my dog,\u201d one fumed.\n\nThe BOP says N95 respirator masks and other protective equipment for staff was stockpiled before the pandemic, but some officers said they couldn\u2019t get the equipment when they needed it. In April, at least four prisons in the Southeast ended up with Chinese KN-95s that staff said appeared to not meet federal safety standards.\n\nAt the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Robin Grubbs, a 39-year-old case manager, was worried about a quarantine unit that had been set up outside her office, according to her father, Gary Grubbs. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give her no mask or nothing like that,\u201d he said.\n\nShe didn\u2019t show up for work on April 14; her coworkers found her unresponsive in her living room.\n\nA spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said an autopsy was not performed on Grubbs because she tested positive for COVID-19, which was listed as the \u201cprobable cause of death.\u201d\n\nHer father said he was told Wednesday that toxicology results showed she had no drugs in her system or other explanation for her sudden death. The GBI spokesperson confirmed the death from \u201cnatural\u201d causes.\n\nGeorge Grubbs is certain his daughter got sick at work.\n\n\"The only place she went was home and her job,\u201d Grubbs said. \u201cWe feel that it had to come from the prison. That\u2019s the only place we know that she\u2019d been around it.\"\n\nThe Clayton County Police Department in suburban Atlanta, which is investigating the death, provided an incident report stating there were \u201cno signs of foul play.\u201d A police spokesperson said \u201cthe cause of death has not been made official.\u201d\n\nThe BOP said \u201cthere is no evidence or information relating to a cause of death.\u201d\n\nKelvin Williams, the Atlanta union chief, said the agency doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge Grubbs as a COVID-19 victim because it would be obligated to pay her family benefits. \u201cThe bureau thinks about the long-term effect of admitting something like that has happened,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey try to downplay it as much as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was like watching a horror movie\u201d\n\nWhile Desilva was on a ventilator at the hospital for much of April, prisoners at Elkton said they were allowed out of their housing units for just a few minutes each day, including for trips to the mess hall. The rush for food triggered stampedes.\n\nThe Record The best criminal justice reporting from around the web, organized by subject\n\nMore and more fell ill and were wheeled out on gurneys. At the peak, according to court records and Elkton staff, 46 prisoners were hospitalized, with 18 on ventilators.\n\n\u201cAs far as I can tell, they ended up taking about one in every five out of here,\u201d Donald Schlittenhardt, a 54-year-old Elkton prisoner, wrote on April 9 of his unit. \u201cThat puts your odds no better than playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter.\u201d\n\nSchlittenhardt, who uses a wheelchair and is serving 20 years on a drug conviction, said officers with pepper spray were summoned when he confronted medical staff in early April about not doing regular temperature checks and ignoring sick prisoners.\n\nMayle, the staff union president, described the encounter as an \u201cisolated incident with a few disgruntled inmates who did not want to go into isolation.\u201d\n\nSchlittenhardt and two other prisoners also said officers threatened them with tear gas and pepper spray when they objected to having to eat lunch outside in 40-degree weather while their housing unit was being disinfected.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Elkton. At prisons across the country, men and women who were sick or had been exposed to COVID-19 reported being held in horrifying conditions. And because the entire BOP system was in lockdown, even prisoners who were not ailing were confined to their bunks or cells, and some didn\u2019t see sunlight for weeks.\n\nAt the minimum-security camp in Lompoc, California, prisoners say they were ordered to pick up one man who collapsed because the officers were afraid of touching him. The prisoners said medics didn\u2019t arrive for about two hours. The BOP said it could not respond to the specific allegation, but that its staff respond to medical emergencies immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, sick men were isolated in a mothballed section of the prison that had previously been used as \u201cthe hole.\u201d\n\nOne prisoner there\u2014who said he\u2019d already been dealing with untreated cancer for a year\u2014reported receiving only one hot meal a day and showering just once in 18 days. He could hear men coughing into the common area through their cell bars, and said he listened as the guards rushed to one prisoner\u2019s cell and said he was \u201cgone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even believe this is happening in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like watching a horror movie.\u201d A BOP spokesperson said only one of Lompoc\u2019s four deaths from COVID-19 actually occurred at the prison itself; the others were in the hospital.\n\nBut more than 93 percent of the people inside the low-security prison contracted the virus.\n\n\u201cI know this changed him\u201d\n\nOn April 28, Rodriguez got the call she\u2019d been hoping for: \u201cHey, gorda,\u201d the familiar deep voice growled. \u201cHow are you guys?\u201d\n\nDesilva still sounded weak\u2014but he was finally out of the hospital.\n\nShe burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI know this changed him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said the nurses were surprised he made it; he was on the verge of dying.\u201d\n\nWe Are Witnesses Intimate portraits of people who have been touched by the criminal justice system\n\nBut her fianc\u00e9 was now in isolation, still without regular phone or email access. Eventually he\u2019d be sent back to a dorm packed with other men. Like many prisoners, he asked for compassionate release. Like most of them, he has not yet gotten it.\n\nChanging policies and internal agency opposition to releases have kept many behind bars. Lashonda Hall, serving 43 years at the prison in Tallahassee for a nonviolent drug crime, called her family to tell them she was being released to home confinement. When staff came back and told her there\u2019d been a mix-up and she hadn\u2019t served enough of her time, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to let her family know.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 does not care how much of your sentence you have done,\u201d she said.\n\nBernd Appleby, a 68-year-old prisoner serving two years for a white-collar tech crime, was initially told he didn\u2019t qualify for release because of a minor disciplinary infraction, according to his wife. During the Super Bowl, he bet on the losing team and had to make good afterward: He owed a single ice cream sandwich. When he mentioned it in an email to a friend, he got written up for gambling.\n\nAt Elkton, Alvin Turner, a 43-year-old from Michigan serving time for a nonviolent drug charge, petitioned the courts to be sent home early, bolstering his case with a letter from prison staff saying he had taught financial literacy to more than 60 people. The BOP announced his death from COVID-19 on April 13.\n\nThe day of Turner\u2019s death, the ACLU sued Carvajal and Warden Mark Williams, arguing that conditions at Elkton violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Prisoners gave sworn declarations describing \u201ccomplete chaos,\u201d \u201cambulances leaving at all hours,\u201d and feeling like they\u2019d been handed death sentences.\n\nFederal Judge James Gwin has sided repeatedly with the prisoners at Elkton, ordering the BOP to swiftly release or transfer 837 people who\u2019d been identified as medically vulnerable.\n\nAfter prison officials declared that only five people met the criteria, Gwin issued a blistering ruling that said Williams and Carvajal were \u201cthumbing their nose at their authority to authorize home confinement\u201d and risking the lives of both staff and prisoners in the process.\n\nThe government first appealed to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, then got the lower court\u2019s ruling overturned by the Sixth Circuit\u2014a decision that dims the prospects of success for similar claims at other federal prisons.\n\nBOP officials continue to maintain that releases are unnecessary and the situation at Elkton is under control.\n\nMayle, the Elkton union president, defended the staff\u2019s handling of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe followed CDC guidelines and did everything in our power to ensure the health and safety of staff and inmates,\u201d Mayle said. \u201cI believe the ball was dropped\u201d by higher-ups, he added.\n\nAs of June 8, according to the Elkton union, nine prisoners remained hospitalized, including four on ventilators. Mass testing revealed 749 confirmed positive cases, including 505 held in isolation because they are symptomatic or otherwise known to be infected. More than 50 staff members have tested positive. The death toll still stands at nine.\n\nMore than two months after he started coughing, Desilva still struggles. He has congestive heart failure and painful swelling in his legs and feet, which landed him in the hospital again briefly in late May. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are still unknown, but he and Rodriguez suspect it\u2019s the cause of his health problems.\n\nThey have a lawyer working on a compassionate release request, which notes his plan to marry Rodriguez. But it\u2019s not clear whether prisoners who\u2019ve already had the virus would qualify. In the meantime, Desilva is worried about being moved to a prison farther away from his fianc\u00e9e, and he\u2019s haunted by dreams of his blurry days in the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for him to get sleep. And when he does, he has nightmares,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cHe wakes up screaming or crying.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version misidentified U.S. District Judge James Gwin.\n\nThis story was updated to include additional information from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations.",
