This is \u201c The Daily . \u201d\nToday : Federal prosecutors are asking a court to throw out their own criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn . Mark Mazzetti on what led to that decision . It \u2019 s Thursday , May 14 . Mark , remind us where the Michael Flynn story starts .\nWell , Michael Flynn was a three-star Army general who had a quite distinguished career , became the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under the Obama administration . And then he gradually sort of moves into the Trump orbit in 2016 when Trump was running for president . During the Republican convention \u2014\narchived recording ( michael flynn ) We do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law .\narchived recording ( crowd ) Lock her up ! archived recording ( michael flynn ) Yes , that \u2019 s right , lock her up !\narchived recording ( michael flynn ) If I did a tenth of what she did , I would be in jail today .\nAnd after Trump is elected , he announces that he \u2019 s going to make Flynn his national security adviser . So it \u2019 s during this time when there \u2019 s a series of events that get Michael Flynn into trouble .\nIt \u2019 s shortly after Christmas in 2016 when the Obama administration announces a number of sanctions against Russia for its efforts to sabotage the 2016 campaign . It was soon after that \u2014\narchived recording The Washington Post reports that Trump \u2019 s incoming national security adviser , Michael Flynn , repeatedly called the Russian ambassador to the U.S. \u2014\n\u2014 that The Washington Post reported that Flynn had been on a number of phone calls with the Russian ambassador \u2014\n\u2014 on the same day the Obama sanctions were announced , which raised questions about whether the incoming Trump administration was trying to meddle with the Obama administration \u2019 s foreign policy .\narchived recording ( mike pence ) I talked to General Flynn about that conversation . Actually , it was \u2014\narchived recording ( mike pence ) They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States \u2019 decision to impose a censure against Russia .\nPence says that Flynn had told him the sanctions never came up on the call . But the Justice Department had transcripts of the calls in which Flynn had actually urged the ambassador not to overreact to the Obama administration \u2019 s sanctions .\narchived recording F.B.I . agents interviewed Michael Flynn about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russian \u2014\nSo F.B.I . agents are sent to the White House to interview Flynn .\nHe tells them that the sanctions never came up on the call .\nRight . This all becomes public , and in February 2017 \u2014\narchived recording General Michael Flynn suddenly resigned late last night .\narchived recording He is the shortest serving national security adviser now in modern history .\nAnd what happens to Flynn once he \u2019 s pushed out of the White House ?\nThe F.B.I . continues to investigate Flynn , but very little is heard from him for a number of months . And during this time , President Trump starts leaning on James Comey , the F.B.I . director , in essence , to drop the Flynn investigation .\nAnd that raised this idea that the President of the United States was trying to obstruct justice . And that \u2019 s this kind of cataclysmic moment that ultimately sets off a chain of events that leads to not only Comey being fired , but also the appointment of Mueller as the special counsel .\nRight . In many ways , the Flynn saga is the beginning of the Mueller saga , and the beginning of a very dark chapter for the Trump administration .\narchived recording Flynn pled guilty to repeatedly lying to the F.B.I .\nFlynn ends up pleading guilty to lying to the F.B.I .\nBecomes a cooperating witness in the Mueller investigation . He \u2019 s awaiting sentence .\narchived recording Court documents make clear that Flynn was not acting alone .\nAnd the significance was that he was the first top White House official to plead guilty as part of the Mueller investigation .\narchived recording Court papers say Flynn could get up to six months behind bars , but he was under \u2014\nMark , I feel like , for many people , that is where the Michael Flynn story pretty much ends , right ? I mean , you have this three-star general , national security adviser who just totally falls from grace after lying to his bosses and the F.B.I. , and now he \u2019 s headed to prison .\nThat \u2019 s right . And the Mueller investigation marches on , and the next significant point is the end of 2018 into 2019 when Flynn is set to be sentenced by a federal judge . And the Mueller team weighs in \u2014\narchived recording Breaking news right now . Bob Mueller \u2019 s office is recommending to the judge that Michael Flynn actually not receive any prison time .\narchived recording Michael Flynn cooperated plenty with the special counsel .\narchived recording The defendant provided firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials .\nAnd something curious happens then , where Flynn \u2019 s legal team , which had been very cooperative towards the Mueller investigation , clearly \u2014 they cut what seemed to be a pretty good deal with the Mueller team \u2014 decide to take a more combative stance . They enter into the public record this idea that maybe Flynn had been railroaded , that the F.B.I . may have set him up . So this angers the judge . He really reads Flynn and his team the riot act , saying , are you now saying you \u2019 re not remorseful ? And why are you now accusing the F.B.I . of misconduct ? And basically says , let \u2019 s take a pause . We \u2019 re going to put this off for a few months and come back to me when you \u2019 ve found some remorse . In the intervening time , the ground starts to shift .\narchived recording William Barr has just been sworn in as the new attorney general , gaining broad control of the special counsel , Robert Mueller \u2019 s , Russia investigation .\narchived recording ( william barr ) I believe it is vitally important that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation .\nHe , during his confirmation hearing , pledges that he \u2019 s not going to interfere with the Mueller investigation . So Mueller famously then delivers his report to Barr in March of 2019 .\narchived recording ( william barr ) The deputy attorney general and I concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense .\nAnd Barr writes a very short summary of sorts that he says summarizes Mueller \u2019 s findings , which we now know misinterprets the Mueller report . It \u2019 s quite clear starting at that point that Barr has great issues with not only the Mueller investigation , but how this all began \u2014 how the Russia investigation began at the F.B.I . and whether there was real misconduct .\narchived recording ( william barr ) I \u2019 ve been trying to get answers to questions , and I found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate , and I also \u2014\nSo he makes no secret of the fact that he \u2019 s going to start investigating the investigation . He is going to launch a campaign to get to the bottom of what happened and whether there really was a political effort to go after Donald J. Trump and his advisers .\nAnd what does that mean for Michael Flynn awaiting sentencing for lying to the F.B.I . ?\nAs the ground shifts , and as it \u2019 s clear that Barr is going to look at the predicate for the entire investigation , Flynn decides to get a new lawyer .\narchived recording ( sidney powell ) Nothing about this case was done right . They violated every rule , every protocol .\nWho is not only a lawyer , but also a pundit of sorts .\narchived recording ( sidney powell ) The entire prosecution was false . It must be dismissed .\nThis is a Texas lawyer named Sidney Powell who has made no secret of the fact that she thinks the entire thing is a witch hunt .\narchived recording ( sidney powell ) Their prosecution of General Flynn was needed to keep the obstruction hoax going against the president , because they already knew the Russia hoax had fallen apart .\nVery much in line with what the President of the United States has said .\narchived recording ( sidney powell ) So the whole thing was orchestrated and set up within the F.B.I .\nAnd days before she takes over as Flynn \u2019 s lawyer , she writes a secret letter to Attorney General Barr where she writes , quote , \u201c It is increasingly apparent that General Flynn was targeted and taken out of the Trump administration for concocted and political purposes . \u201d\nWow . So you \u2019 re saying Flynn recognizes the winds are changing , recognizing that there \u2019 s literally a new sheriff , attorney general in town , who \u2019 s skeptical of the entire Russia investigation , and so Flynn hires a lawyer who fits quite nicely into that dynamic .\nYes . And during that period of time , Attorney General Barr decides to appoint another prosecutor who \u2019 s going to examine the case and see whether there had been any misconduct that had taken place .\nSo just to be clear , in addition to examining the roots of the Russia investigation broadly , Barr appoints a specific prosecutor inside the Department of Justice just to examine the Flynn case ?\nAnd that leads to the release of a number of documents to the public in recent weeks that have led both Flynn \u2019 s lawyers and the president to make the case that Michael Flynn was indeed railroaded and set up by the F.B.I .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . Mark , tell us what \u2019 s inside these documents .\nIn essence , the documents are internal F.B.I . and Justice Department communications around the time that Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I . And what they show , kind of broadly , are that there was concern about the decision to interview Flynn . One of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by Bill Priestap , who at the time was the head of the F.B.I. \u2018 s Counterintelligence Division , which was running the whole Russia investigation . And this is January 24 , four days after the Trump administration takes over , and right before there is this decision to go send F.B.I . agents to interview the national security adviser . And Priestap writes , quote , \u201c What \u2019 s our goal , truth/admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired ? \u201d\nIn another document , he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview , and he says , \u201c Protect our institution by not playing games . And if we are seen playing games , the White House will be furious . \u201d\nSome of that language is quite potentially inflammatory , the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired \u2014 essentially , to get him in trouble .\nIt raises this question of whether Sidney Powell , Flynn \u2019 s lawyers , had a point , that they were trying to set him up , right ? And finally , there \u2019 s also interesting divide that is revealed between the F.B.I . and the Justice Department , and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of Justice Department about what the F.B.I . was up to .\nSo there \u2019 s some concern about whether or not interviewing Flynn is at all a good idea .\nRight . And we find out that the F.B.I . only tells the Justice Department they \u2019 re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the White House .\nHuh . Mark , what happens once these internal F.B.I . documents are released ? What \u2019 s the reaction ?\narchived recording ( sidney powell ) He should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt .\narchived recording ( sidney powell ) \u2014 that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing Mr. Flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up .\narchived recording 1 A lot of people close to this feel like Michael Flynn was setup , never lied . archived recording 2 Admitting that they got things completely wrong , and actively worked to defame \u2014 archived recording 3 Instead , it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the F.B.I . handled Hillary Clinton and how they handled Donald Trump .\narchived recording ( donald trump ) When I looked at what they did to him , they tormented him . Dirty cops tormented General Flynn .\n\u2014 making the case that Flynn should never have been interviewed , and the case should now be dropped .\nAnd what would be the legal basis for that argument ? What in the documents do Flynn \u2019 s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate ?\nWell , they \u2019 re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the F.B.I . about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place .\nAnd if the interview doesn \u2019 t take place , then there \u2019 s no lies to worry about . And if there \u2019 s no lies , then there \u2019 s nothing to prosecute Flynn on . And therefore , there is no case period , and Michael Flynn should walk free . You have no predicate to be there in the beginning , then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation . And this is what Barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week .\narchived recording Just in this afternoon , the Justice Department is dropping its criminal case against President Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser , retired General Michael Flynn .\narchived recording The Justice Department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of Flynn .\nBarr said there was never any good reason to interview Michael Flynn in the first place , and so whatever Flynn said during the interview was irrelevant . And Barr even goes further than that .\narchived recording ( catherine herridge ) Attorney General Barr , thank you for speaking first to CBS news . archived recording ( william barr ) Hi , Catherine .\nIn an interview last week , he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview Flynn \u2014\narchived recording ( william barr ) There was not , in our view , a legitimate investigation \u2014\n\u2014 but he also goes to bat for Flynn going all the way back to Flynn \u2019 s phone calls with the Russian ambassador .\narchived recording ( william barr ) And it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders . And that call , there was nothing wrong with it whatever . In fact , it was laudable . And it was nothing inconsistent with the Obama administration \u2019 s policies , and it was in U.S. interest . He was saying to the Russians , don \u2019 t escalate .\nHe actually says that the phone calls were laudable , and that it was perfectly understandable that Flynn would talk to the Russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment .\narchived recording When history looks back on this decision , how do you think it will be written ? archived recording ( william barr ) Well , history is written by the winners , so it largely depends on who \u2019 s writing the history .\nI mean , what \u2019 s fascinating about what Barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the Department of Justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant .\nAnd it \u2019 s in keeping with what William Barr has done for a year . From the time that Robert Mueller presented his report to barr , Barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation . He has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly , or whether the F.B.I . overreached . He has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others .\nMark , is Barr \u2019 s legal analysis in the Flynn case sound ? Is it in dispute ?\nBarr \u2019 s decision has been widely criticized . Plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue , what is germane to the case , and in this specific instance , the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between Trump aides and the Russians would make Flynn \u2019 s calls germane to this particular investigation . That is not to say that now looking back , there haven \u2019 t been instances of F.B.I . abuse over the course of the Russia investigation .\nMark , given everything you \u2019 ve just said , and reading these documents that have been released from the Department of Justice about the debate that went on inside the F.B.I . \u2014 these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview , whether they might , basically , trap Flynn in a lie and get him fired \u2014 I mean , is there a version of this where what Bill Barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution , which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant ?\nYou always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted . That \u2019 s true if the target is Michael Flynn , or if the target is someone far less famous . The concern , of course , is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction .\nThat what the attorney general is doing is , in effect , launching a campaign to discredit the investigation , to discredit the Mueller probe , to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss , President Trump . Remember , President Trump , who \u2019 s been railing against the quote unquote \u201c witch hunt \u201d for years , will be using this for his re-election campaign . So the concern , of course , is that Bill Barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president .\nBut Mark , is it possible that both things can be true \u2014 that the Attorney General Bill Barr may be trying to discredit the entire Russia investigation , and in the process , very much oversimplify things , and that the prosecution of Michael Flynn might be flawed ?\nAnd this is why the passions are so intense on this issue , because both sides want to control the narrative , and because of that , can \u2019 t allow , necessarily , any gray area in this argument . Either Michael Flynn is a hero or he \u2019 s a traitor . Either the Mueller investigation was a just pursuit , or it was a witch hunt . And of course , there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white .\nSo Mark , what \u2019 s going to happen to Michael Flynn now ?\nWell , of course , given what William Barr decided , there is a very likely scenario that Michael Flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold , and in the coming months , we see him once again campaigning for Donald Trump .\nOn Wednesday night , The Times reported that before the Department of Justice sought to throw out the case against Michael Flynn , it had interviewed the F.B.I . official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap Flynn . In that interview , the official , Bill Priestap , said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set Flynn up .\nWe \u2019 ll be right back . Here \u2019 s what else you need to know today .\narchived recording ( jerome powell ) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent , significantly worse than any recession since World War II . We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity \u2014\nIn a speech on Wednesday , the chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the American economy if Congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment .\narchived recording ( jerome powell ) Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers \u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt .\nThe message from Jerome Powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that Congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough .\narchived recording ( jerome powell ) Additional fiscal support could be costly , but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery .\nAnd the House of Representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely , so that they can avoid traveling to Washington during the pandemic . The rules , expected to pass tomorrow , would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person .",

Mark, tell us what\u2019s inside these documents.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIn essence, the documents are internal F.B.I. and Justice Department communications around the time that Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. And what they show, kind of broadly, are that there was concern about the decision to interview Flynn. One of the documents that got a lot of attention was written by Bill Priestap, who at the time was the head of the F.B.I.\u2018s Counterintelligence Division, which was running the whole Russia investigation. And this is January 24, four days after the Trump administration takes over, and right before there is this decision to go send F.B.I. agents to interview the national security adviser. And Priestap writes, quote, \u201cWhat\u2019s our goal, truth/admission or to get him to lie so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\u201d\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIn another document, he seems to understand the risks of conducting this interview, and he says, \u201cProtect our institution by not playing games. And if we are seen playing games, the White House will be furious.\u201d\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSome of that language is quite potentially inflammatory, the idea that the person running the investigation is wondering if their goal might be to get the national security adviser fired \u2014 essentially, to get him in trouble.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIt raises this question of whether Sidney Powell, Flynn\u2019s lawyers, had a point, that they were trying to set him up, right? And finally, there\u2019s also interesting divide that is revealed between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, and what some of the documents show is that there was some concern of Justice Department about what the F.B.I. was up to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo there\u2019s some concern about whether or not interviewing Flynn is at all a good idea.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nRight. And we find out that the F.B.I. only tells the Justice Department they\u2019re going to go do this while the agents are on their way to the White House.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. Mark, what happens once these internal F.B.I. documents are released? What\u2019s the reaction?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThis unleashes a torrent of criticism.\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) He should dismiss the case for egregious government misconduct without a doubt.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBy Flynn\u2019s lawyer, Sidney Powell \u2014\n\narchived recording (sidney powell) \u2014 that the government has been hiding this evidence that shows their own crimes while they were accusing Mr. Flynn falsely of any crimes because they made it all up.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n\u2014 by other commentators on the right \u2014\n\narchived recording 1 A lot of people close to this feel like Michael Flynn was setup, never lied. archived recording 2 Admitting that they got things completely wrong, and actively worked to defame \u2014 archived recording 3 Instead, it looks like two systems of justice in terms of how the F.B.I. handled Hillary Clinton and how they handled Donald Trump.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n\u2014 by President Trump \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) When I looked at what they did to him, they tormented him. Dirty cops tormented General Flynn.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n\u2014 making the case that Flynn should never have been interviewed, and the case should now be dropped.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what would be the legal basis for that argument? What in the documents do Flynn\u2019s lawyers seize on and say makes his prosecution illegitimate?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell, they\u2019re saying that these documents reveal that there was real concern in the F.B.I. about whether the interview should have taken place in the first place.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd if the interview doesn\u2019t take place, then there\u2019s no lies to worry about. And if there\u2019s no lies, then there\u2019s nothing to prosecute Flynn on. And therefore, there is no case period, and Michael Flynn should walk free. You have no predicate to be there in the beginning, then whatever you find is immaterial to the investigation. And this is what Barr seizes on when he makes this incredibly dramatic decision last week.\n\narchived recording Just in this afternoon, the Justice Department is dropping its criminal case against President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, retired General Michael Flynn.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nTo drop the charges against Michael Flynn.\n\narchived recording The Justice Department today is holding that there was not a legitimate basis to do an investigation of Flynn.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBarr said there was never any good reason to interview Michael Flynn in the first place, and so whatever Flynn said during the interview was irrelevant. And Barr even goes further than that.\n\narchived recording (catherine herridge) Attorney General Barr, thank you for speaking first to CBS news. archived recording (william barr) Hi, Catherine.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nIn an interview last week, he not only criticizes the decisions that were made at the time to interview Flynn \u2014\n\narchived recording (william barr) There was not, in our view, a legitimate investigation \u2014\n\nmark mazzetti\n\n\u2014 but he also goes to bat for Flynn going all the way back to Flynn\u2019s phone calls with the Russian ambassador.\n\narchived recording (william barr) And it is very typical and very common for the national security team of the incoming president to communicate with foreign leaders. And that call, there was nothing wrong with it whatever. In fact, it was laudable. And it was nothing inconsistent with the Obama administration\u2019s policies, and it was in U.S. interest. He was saying to the Russians, don\u2019t escalate.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nHe actually says that the phone calls were laudable, and that it was perfectly understandable that Flynn would talk to the Russian ambassador to try to lower tensions in a very tense environment.\n\narchived recording When history looks back on this decision, how do you think it will be written? archived recording (william barr) Well, history is written by the winners, so it largely depends on who\u2019s writing the history.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, what\u2019s fascinating about what Barr is doing is that it does not feel like every day when the Department of Justice sides with a defendant in a criminal prosecution over its own prosecutors who have successfully gone after that defendant.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nAnd it\u2019s in keeping with what William Barr has done for a year. From the time that Robert Mueller presented his report to barr, Barr has questioned the legitimacy of the investigation and any fruits of that investigation. He has questioned whether those prosecuted were done so fairly, or whether the F.B.I. overreached. He has also backed decisions to lower sentences of others.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, is Barr\u2019s legal analysis in the Flynn case sound? Is it in dispute?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nBarr\u2019s decision has been widely criticized. Plenty of legal experts say that prosecutors in general have wide discretion to decide which aspects of the investigation they want to pursue, what is germane to the case, and in this specific instance, the fact that there was an ongoing investigation into contact between Trump aides and the Russians would make Flynn\u2019s calls germane to this particular investigation. That is not to say that now looking back, there haven\u2019t been instances of F.B.I. abuse over the course of the Russia investigation.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, given everything you\u2019ve just said, and reading these documents that have been released from the Department of Justice about the debate that went on inside the F.B.I. \u2014 these notes from an agent about how to conduct this interview, whether they might, basically, trap Flynn in a lie and get him fired \u2014 I mean, is there a version of this where what Bill Barr has done is exactly what any justice system should do when there are serious questions about the legitimacy of a prosecution, which is kind of give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYou always want greater transparency when it comes to how an investigation was conducted. That\u2019s true if the target is Michael Flynn, or if the target is someone far less famous. The concern, of course, is whether there is abuse going on in the other direction.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThat what the attorney general is doing is, in effect, launching a campaign to discredit the investigation, to discredit the Mueller probe, to discredit its results in a way that will ultimately benefit his boss, President Trump. Remember, President Trump, who\u2019s been railing against the quote unquote \u201cwitch hunt\u201d for years, will be using this for his re-election campaign. So the concern, of course, is that Bill Barr is kind of acting as a proxy warrior for the president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut Mark, is it possible that both things can be true \u2014 that the Attorney General Bill Barr may be trying to discredit the entire Russia investigation, and in the process, very much oversimplify things, and that the prosecution of Michael Flynn might be flawed?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nYes, both of those things can be true.\n\n[music]\n\nAnd this is why the passions are so intense on this issue, because both sides want to control the narrative, and because of that, can\u2019t allow, necessarily, any gray area in this argument. Either Michael Flynn is a hero or he\u2019s a traitor. Either the Mueller investigation was a just pursuit, or it was a witch hunt. And of course, there is a lot of space between those characterizations and nuance that gets lost because the political debate is black and white.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mark, what\u2019s going to happen to Michael Flynn now?\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nWell, of course, given what William Barr decided, there is a very likely scenario that Michael Flynn soon is a free man and he is brought back into the fold, and in the coming months, we see him once again campaigning for Donald Trump.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, Mark.\n\nmark mazzetti\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday night, The Times reported that before the Department of Justice sought to throw out the case against Michael Flynn, it had interviewed the F.B.I. official whose notes have been interpreted as potentially seeking to entrap Flynn. In that interview, the official, Bill Priestap, said that his notes had been misconstrued and that there was no effort to set Flynn up.\n\n[music]\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. Here\u2019s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II. We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that the pandemic could permanently damage the American economy if Congress does not act to prevent a wave of bankruptcies and prolonged unemployment.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up and leave families in greater debt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe message from Jerome Powell suggested that the trillions of dollars that Congress has already pumped into the economy may not be enough.\n\narchived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the House of Representatives is poised to temporarily change its rules to allow lawmakers to vote and hold committee hearings remotely, so that they can avoid traveling to Washington during the pandemic. The rules, expected to pass tomorrow, would mark a major change for a body long defined by the tradition of meeting and voting in person.\n\n[music]",
