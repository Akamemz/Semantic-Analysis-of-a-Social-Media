Turkey launched a military operation Wednesday against Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria after U.S. forces pulled back from the area , with a series of airstrikes hitting a town on Syria 's northern border . ( AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis )\nAKCAKALE , Turkey ( AP ) \u2014 Turkey launched airstrikes , fired artillery and began a ground offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria on Wednesday after U.S. troops pulled back from the area , paving the way for an assault on forces that have long been allied with the United States .\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the start of the campaign , which followed the abrupt decision Sunday by U.S. President Donald Trump to essentially abandon the Syrian Kurdish fighters , leaving them vulnerable to a Turkish offensive that was widely condemned around the world .\nThe decision was a major shift in U.S. policy and drew opposition from all sides at home . It also marked a stark change in rhetoric by Trump , who during a press conference in New York last year vowed to stand by the Kurds , who have been America \u2019 s only allies in Syria fighting the Islamic State group . Trump said at the time that the Kurds \u201c fought with us \u201d and \u201c died with us , \u201d and insisted that America would never forget .\nAfter Erdogan announced the offensive , Trump called the operation \u201c a bad idea. \u201d Later Wednesday , he said he didn \u2019 t want to be involved in \u201c endless , senseless wars . \u201d\nIn northern Syria , residents of the border areas were in a panic and got out on foot , in cars and with rickshaws piled with mattresses and a few belongings . It was a wrenchingly familiar scenario for the many who , only a few years ago , had fled the advances on their towns and villages by the Islamic State group .\nPlumes of smoke could be seen rising near the town of Qamishli and clashes continued late Wednesday amid intense shelling as Turkey struck at least six different border towns along a 290-mile ( 300-kilometer ) stretch . At least seven civilians and three members of the Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces were killed in the Turkish bombardment , Kurdish activists and a Syria war monitor said .\nTurkey \u2019 s campaign \u2014 in which a NATO member rained down bombs on an area where hundreds of U.S. troops had been stationed \u2014 drew immediate criticism and calls for restraint from Europe . In his statement , Trump emphasized that there are no American soldiers in the immediate area under attack .\n\u201c Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border , and to bring peace to the area , \u201d Erdogan said in a tweet announcing what he called \u201c Operation Peace Spring . \u201d\nHe said that Turkish forces , with Ankara-backed Syrian fighters known as the Syrian National Army , had begun to eradicate what he called \u201c the threat of terror \u201d against Turkey .\nMustafa Bali , a spokesman for the U.S.-backed SDF , said Turkish warplanes were targeting \u201c civilian areas \u201d in northern Syria and that shells also had fallen near a prison guarded by Kurds and holding some of the most dangerous IS militants . The AP could not verify the report independently .\nIn Washington , officials said two British militants believed to be part of an Islamic State group that beheaded hostages and was known as \u201c The Beatles \u201d had been moved out of a detention center in Syria and were in U.S. custody .\nBefore Turkey \u2019 s attack , Syrian Kurdish forces who control nearly 30 percent of Syria \u2019 s territory warned of a \u201c humanitarian catastrophe. \u201d More than 2 million people live in the area impacted by the attacks , according to aid groups .\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said those killed in the Turkish bombardments included two Christian Assyrians in Qamishli , a married couple and their child , a man in a village outside the town of Tal Abyad , and a child in a village west of Qamishli .\nThe Turkish operation meant to create a \u201c safe zone \u201d carries potential gains and risk for Turkey by getting its forces even more deeply involved in the Syria war . It also ignites new fighting in Syria \u2019 s 8-year-old war , potentially displacing hundreds of thousands .\nA resident of Tal Abyad said one of the bombs hit an SDF post , and he fled with his wife and mother by car to Raqqa , nearly 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) to the south , to flee the bombing . The resident , who gave his name as Maher , said the road to Raqqa was packed with vehicles and families , some fleeing on foot \u201c to get away from the bombing . \u201d\n\u201c People fled and left everything behind , \u201d he said in a text message after he reached safety .\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey . Expectations of an invasion increased after Trump \u2019 s announcement Sunday , although he also threatened to \u201c totally destroy and obliterate \u201d Turkey \u2019 s economy if the Turkish push went too far .\nU.S. critics said he was sacrificing an ally , the Syrian Kurdish forces , and undermining Washington \u2019 s credibility . Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , a Trump ally , told \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d that if Trump \u201c follows through with this , it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency . \u201d\nTrump later said the U.S. \u201c does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea . \u201d\nTrump said he made clear from the start of his political career that \u201c I did not want to fight these endless , senseless wars \u2014 especially those that don \u2019 t benefit the United States . Turkey has committed to protecting civilians , protecting religious minorities , including Christians , and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment . \u201d\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg , while noting that Turkey \u201c has legitimate security concerns \u201d after suffering \u201c horrendous terrorist attacks \u201d and hosting thousands of refugees , said the country should not \u201c further destabilize the region \u201d with its military action in Syria .\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas condemned the offensive , saying it will \u201c further destabilize the region and strengthen IS. \u201d The operation also was criticized by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker .\nThe EU is paying Turkey 6 billion euros ( $ 6.6 billion ) to help the country cope with almost 4 million Syrian refugees on its territory in exchange for stopping migrants leaving for Europe .\nThe Turkish presidency \u2019 s communications director urged the international community to rally behind Ankara .
