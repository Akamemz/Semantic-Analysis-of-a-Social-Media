    "content": "Imagine you 're sitting in a restaurant and a loud group of armed men come through the door . They are ostentatiously displaying their weapons , making sure that everyone notices them . Would you feel safe or would you feel in danger ? Would you feel comfortable confronting them ? If you owned the restaurant could you ask them to leave ? These are questions that are facing more and more Americans in their everyday lives as `` open carry '' enthusiasts descend on public places ostensibly for the sole purpose of exercising their constitutional right to do it . It just makes them feel good , apparently .\nFor instance , in the wake of the new Georgia law that pretty much makes it legal to carry deadly weapons at all times in all places , parents were alarmed when an armed man showed up at the park where their kids were playing little league baseball and waved his gun around shouting , `` Look at my gun ! '' and `` There 's nothing you can do about it . '' The police were called and when they arrived they found the man had broken no laws and was perfectly within his rights to do what he did . That was small consolation to the parents , however . Common sense tells anyone that a man waving a gun around in public is dangerous so the parents had no choice but to leave the park . Freedom for the man with the gun trumps freedom for the parents of kids who feel endangered by him .\nAfter the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre , open carry advocates decided it was a good idea to descend upon Starbucks stores around the country , even in Newtown where a couple dozen armed demonstrators showed up , to make their political point . There were no incidents . Why would there be ? When an armed citizen decides to exercise his right to bear arms , it would be reckless to exercise your right to free speech if you disagreed with them . But it did cause the CEO of Starbucks to ask very politely if these gun proliferation supporters would kindly not use his stores as the site of their future `` statements . '' He did n't ban them from the practice , however . His reason ? He did n't want to put his employees in the position of having to confront armed customers to tell them to leave . Sure , Starbucks might have the `` right '' to ban guns on private property in theory , but in practice no boss can tell his workers that they must try to evict someone who is carrying a deadly weapon .\nJust last week open carry proponents decided to have one of their `` demonstrations '' by going into a Jack in the Box en masse , scaring the employees so badly that they hid in the walk-in freezer . The so-called demonstrators seemed confused by the response of police who assumed there was an armed robbery in progress and dispatched a phalanx of cops .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not breaking the laws , '' Haros said . `` We \u2019 re not here to hurt anybody . We \u2019 re not trying to alarm anybody . We \u2019 re doing this because it \u2019 s our constitutional right . ''\nHaros , who believes openly carrying firearms helps police , said citizens should know that the demonstrations will continue .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just for safety purposes , '' Haros said . `` Officers can \u2019 t be there at all times .

And while they do n't wear uniforms so you ca n't identify them , have no specialized training in the law , are not bound by police protocols or answer to the authority of the democratic system of government of the people , they have taken it upon themselves to look after all of us because the police are busy .
