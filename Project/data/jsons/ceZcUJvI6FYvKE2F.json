    "content": "Stacey Abrams , former Georgia House minority leader and a self-described \u201c nerd , \u201d is on a mission to capture the governor \u2019 s mansion . With 1 point separating her and her opponent , Ms. Abrams could become the first black woman in America to lead a state . \u201c Leadership is combining vision with good government while also carving out new spaces for progress , \u201d Abrams said in an interview . She believes that message is unifying in a \u201c moment of tumult. \u201d To win , political observers say , Abrams has to walk a tightrope : excite disgruntled Millennials by offering transformational change while offering competent leadership for all . How that plays out among women voters in the suburbs will be key . Millennial mom Tiffany Cowley finds an attack ad calling Abrams a socialist \u201c worse than Nancy Pelosi \u201d preposterous . \u201c This election has made me realize that I am a lot more progressive than I ever thought I was , \u201d she says . But Abrams is also attempting to appeal to those unlikely to vote for her , touring all 159 counties . In Glenwood , a dying timber town as desperate as they come for revival , Jacob Raiford says he is concerned that a liberal mind-set will melt away values that make America great . \u201c You know what ? It ain \u2019 t worth it if we get Obama Jr. in return , \u201d he says .\nOn a wall on the 16th floor of the Hurt Building in Atlanta , next to a colorful \u201c Shirley Chisholm for President \u2018 72 \u201d poster , guests to the Undivided tech incubator are asked to jot down their dreams .\nStacey Abrams took a second the other day to think , then quickly wrote : \u201c To be governor of Georgia & own a transporter like in \u2018 Star Trek \u2019 . \u201d\nJust a few years ago in this rose-red state , both of those would have been seen as highly illogical .\nBut now the first one has drawn surprisingly close to reality for Ms. Abrams , the former Georgia house minority leader and a self-described \u201c nerd \u201d on a mission to capture the governor \u2019 s mansion . With one point separating her and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp , Abrams could very well become not only the first black governor of Georgia , but the first black woman in America to ever lead a state .\n\u201c Leadership is combining vision with good government while also carving out new spaces for progress , \u201d she said in an interview with the Monitor . She says she believes that message is unifying in a \u201c moment of tumult . \u201d\nThe razor-tight race has been accompanied by record early voting , national scrutiny , and heated controversy . After an Associated Press analysis found that 53,000 voter registrations had been suspended , about 70 percent of them African-American , Abrams and other Democrats called for Mr. Kemp to resign as the state \u2019 s top election official to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest . Kemp , for his part , has called the allegations of voter suppression a politically manufactured story .\nAll week , people have been waiting up to three hours in line to vote \u2013 with some 296,000 Georgians already having cast their ballots by Thursday . On Monday , the first day of early voting , about 129,500 people had voted either in person or by mail , compared with just over 46,000 four years ago . The Trump-anointed Kemp was leading Abrams 47 to 46 percent , with only 4 percent of likely voters still undecided , according to a poll out Wednesday from Reuters/Ipsos/University of Virginia Center for Politics . That \u2019 s well within the margin of error .\nBut in the past , calling for the razing of the Confederate memorial at Stone Mountain , as Abrams has done , would have disqualified any gubernatorial candidate \u2013 as would proposing an assault-style weapons ban . Yet the close race suggests what Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie says is the emergence of a cross-generational and cross-racial moment that could transform the face of the Deep South state .\nTo win , political observers say , Abrams has to walk a tightrope : Excite disgruntled Millennials by offering transformational change while offering competent leadership for all . Abrams has pointed to her history of bipartisan compromise while in the state house .\nHow that plays out among women voters in the suburbs will be key . But so will her outreach to rural Georgia , where she may not gain many votes , but where she is vying at least for a measure of acceptance .\n\u201c Stacey Abrams is running a new kind of campaign , \u201d says Georgia State University political scientist Daniel Franklin , author of \u201c Pitiful Giants : Presidents in their final terms. \u201d Unlike the big-name Clintonesque centrists who have lost \u2013 badly \u2013 here , \u201c she is running from the left . She ain \u2019 t fooling around . She is trying a new model , a turnout model . \u201d\nThat said , Professor Franklin says , Abrams \u2019 s \u201c problem is that , if most of us are either donkeys or elephants , there aren \u2019 t enough donkeys in Georgia \u201d to form a political majority .\nWithout a lot of political role models , Abrams is her own unique self , a self-described \u201c Star Trek nerd \u201d but also a Yale Law School graduate equally at ease crunching tax code as churning out pages for her latest romance novel , of which she has written eight . Her ninth book is her memoir , \u201c Minority Leader. \u201d The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sounds \u201c like a reality-TV show , \u201d she quips .\nAs Avondale High School valedictorian , she was once denied entry to celebration of the state \u2019 s academic stars at the governor \u2019 s mansion . The high-schooler had arrived on a city bus . That incident made a deep impression on her and the story has made her campaign deeply evocative for many Georgians who feel forgotten by the state \u2019 s rock-solid Republican majority .\nBut she has said she is not bitter . As minority leader , she collaborated with Republican colleagues to reshape a popular college scholarship and partnered with Republican Gov . Nathan Deal to reform the state \u2019 s criminal justice system .\n\u201c I am willing to work across the aisle , but not without carving out a slice , \u201d she says .\nWith only 4 percent of Georgians undecided , there is little wiggle room for either candidate .\nAbrams needs usually apathetic Democrats , including black voters , to come out in droves . She is banking on a re-run of the Doug Jones Senate win in Alabama last year , where black women made a statement by defeating controversial former Judge Roy Moore , who had been accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls .\nKemp , for his part , needs the Trump base to turn out .\nThe campaign will be fought and won in the suburbs , where Trump remains unpopular , says Brent Buchanan , a GOP pollster out of Montgomery , Ala .\nLast week , both candidates turned out national figures for fundraising events . Donald Trump , Jr. , attracted about 50 people to a $ 50 a plate fundraiser for Kemp . Nearly 400 showed up to Abrams \u2019 s free event in suburban Morrow , where she was flanked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D ) of Massachusetts and Ayanna Pressley , who won a stunning upset against a 10-term incumbent in the Massachusetts primary .\nAs supporters wore T-shirts with slogans like \u201c Eat Grits , Be Happy , \u201d and \u201c Larry David for President , \u201d Ms. Pressley warmed up the rally , exhorting them to urge their friends and family to vote : \u201c If I \u2019 m speaking to the choir , well , I need you to sing ! \u201d\nPatrik Jonsson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Tiffany Cowley came to her first political event in Morrow , Ga. , on Oct. 9 , to support Stacey Abrams . The contest between Trump-supported Brian Kemp and Ms. Abrams , a Democrat , will likely be won and lost in the state 's vast suburbs , and likely decided by women like Ms. Cowley , a mom and business owner .\nTiffany Cowley stood listening nearby . A self-described \u201c Millennial mom \u201d from the suburbs , this is her first political event . Her issues are education and gun safety . What she saw as the naked insults of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination are also swirling in her mind as she prepares to vote for Abrams .\nShe has noticed a phenomenon of white women , including friends , \u201c putting their husbands on a pedestal. \u201d Both her parents owned businesses and worked hard . \u201c Just like they did , I now co-parent with my husband , a partnership of equals . \u201d\nAttack ads on Abrams as a socialist \u201c worse than Nancy Pelosi \u201d who wants to let sexual predators onto playgrounds ring preposterous to Cowley .\n\u201c This election has made me realize that I am a lot more progressive than I ever thought I was , \u201d she says .\nSuch personal realizations among educated suburban women may , in fact , drive the outcome .\n\u201c What realigned the American South over the last half century does not resonate as strongly with [ Southern Millennials ] \u201d \u2013 issues like \u201c social issues , gun issues , fears of the browning of America , fears of Muslims , \u201d says James LaPlant , who studies Southern politics as a dean at Valdosta State University . \u201c What is resonating are campaigns that emphasize economic issues , what the future portends for you , how to deal with large amounts of student debt . \u201d\nAndre Dickens , an Atlanta city councilor , says Abrams \u2019 s road to victory runs through Atlanta , her suburbs , and the Democratic cores of cities like Augusta , Albany , Macon , and Savannah .\nOn the other hand , Mr. Buchanan , the GOP pollster , says his firm doesn \u2019 t even bother to poll rural parts of South Georgia because , well , Abrams \u201c doesn \u2019 t have a chance to pick off rural Republican voters in Georgia . \u201d\nBut she has attempted to appeal to those unlikely to vote for her , touring all 159 counties , playing up her rural roots in places like Wheeler County . In 2012 , she notes , she won the livestock competition at the annual legislative games with a 1,000-pound heifer named Bessie .\nAbrams has a bevy of proposals that could aid rural Georgia : 22,000 state-funded apprenticeships , Medicaid expansion to help devastated rural health care , needs-based student loan repayment . The bottom line message to conservative voters , says supporter Audrey Gibbons , is that \u201c Stacey Abrams is more than qualified to govern Georgia . \u201d\nTo many , she says , Abrams \u2019 s candidacy asks fundamental questions about citizenship and belonging .\n\u201c Conservatives would be disappointed if she wins like they were disappointed when we elected the skinny man with the funny name , \u201d says Ms. Gibbons , the Democratic county chair in Glynn County in a phone interview . \u201c Abrams was not born in Georgia , but she came to Georgia and made her home , became educated , did everything we are taught to do , believes in Jesus Christ . Then the question becomes : Why should we hold up because our views don \u2019 t equal up to your antique views ? \u201d\nJacob Raiford says he has three clues to the answer .\nPatrik Jonsson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Brian Kemp voter Jacob Raiford , shown in Glenwood , Ga. , on Oct. 9 , says liberals like Stacey Abrams will destroy the 'real Georgia ' by weakening gun laws and by allowing immigrants to change American values .\nHe lays them out one by one on the counter at his Glenwood , Ga. , package store : a large .45 magnum revolver , a snub-nosed smaller caliber , and a shotgun .\nThe gesture of displaying guns to a stranger seems menacing \u2013 but only for a moment .\nGuard down and guns stowed away , Mr. Raiford turns out to be a talkative 29-year-old who does not identify as a \u201c coddled \u201d Millennial . \u201c I got the belt if I misbehaved , and I agree with that , \u201d he explains .\nHe has worked as a prison guard , owned a restaurant by 20 , and played for a championship basketball team .\n\u201c I was middle class once , but the middle class is gone , \u201d he says . He blames the Obama administration and what he sees as the infusion of laissez-faire living through government support . He also speaks openly about his fear of Muslims \u2013 despite the fact that in 2014 fewer than 1 percent of Georgians identified as Muslim , according to the Pew Research Center . \u201c Muslims in prison means that the mess can \u2019 t serve bacon .
