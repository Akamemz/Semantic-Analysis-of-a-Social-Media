If the context of polarization and online hostility didn \u2019 t exist , the Russian posts would have stood out as conspicuous forgeries , even given our level of news illiteracy .

Granted , the Russians \u2019 intention was the opposite of the cable news outlets , the radio hatemongers , and most U.S. citizens . If democracy is a marriage , they wanted to lure us toward bitter divorce , or perhaps a murder-suicide , whereas those of us motivated not solely by likes or Nielsen ratings want to save the marriage by winning key arguments .

Attacks ads have now jumped from political campaigns to news outlets to our own posts on social media .
