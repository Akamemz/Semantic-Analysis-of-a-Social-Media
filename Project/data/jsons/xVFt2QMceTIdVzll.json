    "content": "The legacy of the Iraq war , and the prospect of a bloody sequel sparked by Donald Trump \u2019 s assassination of a senior Iranian official in Baghdad this week , has the potential to transform the Democratic primary , offering voters radically different visions of how the next commander-in-chief proposes to deal with the ongoing chaos caused by the 2003 invasion . Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren described the drone strike ordered by Trump as a dangerous escalation and promised to end American wars in the Middle East . Joe Biden , the former vice president , and Pete Buttigieg , the former mayor of South Bend , Indiana , offered more muted criticism , suggesting that the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani might have been justified if a more responsible commander-in-chief was in charge . \u201c We must do more than just stop war with Iran , \u201d Sanders tweeted on Friday . \u201c We must firmly commit to ending U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner . We must end our involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen . We must bring our troops home from Afghanistan . \u201d\nWe must do more than just stop war with Iran .\nWe must firmly commit to ending U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner .\nWe must end our involvement in the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen .\nWe must bring our troops home from Afghanistan . \u2014 Bernie Sanders ( @ BernieSanders ) January 3 , 2020\nWarren , who faced criticism from the left for initially prefacing her alarm at the threat of \u201c another costly war \u201d with the statement that Suleimani was \u201c a murderer , responsible for the deaths of thousands , including hundreds of Americans , \u201d amplified Sanders \u2019 s anti-war message more clearly on Friday . \u201c Donald Trump is dangerous and reckless , \u201d she wrote . \u201c He \u2019 s escalated crises and betrayed our partners . He \u2019 s undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal , political gain . We can not allow him to drag us back into another war . We must speak out. \u201d Biden also criticized the killing of the general as needlessly provocative , but issued a statement that embraced the Trump administration \u2019 s argument that Suleimani , who orchestrated deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers during the post-war occupation of Iraq , \u201c deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops. \u201d The former vice president \u2014 who voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq when he was still in the Senate , and later authored a bizarre plan to partition the country along ethnic and sectarian lines \u2014 was critical mainly of what he called Trump \u2019 s failure to explain his \u201c strategy and plan to keep safe our troops and embassy personnel \u201d and Trump \u2019 s lack of a \u201c long-term vision \u201d for the U.S. military \u2019 s role in the region . ( Trump offered a glimpse of his addled vision on Saturday , threatening to strike 52 targets in Iran , including cultural sites , representing , he tweeted , \u201c the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago. \u201d ) Buttigieg \u2019 s initial statement also endorsed Trump \u2019 s claim that killing an Iranian general who supported Iraqi militias that oppose the ongoing presence of U.S. troops in their country was in line with the commander-in-chief \u2019 s responsibility \u201c to protect Americans and our national security interests. \u201d \u201c There is no question that Qassim Suleimani was a threat to that safety and security , and that he masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies , leading to hundreds of deaths , \u201d Buttigieg wrote . \u201c But there are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences. \u201d Like Biden , and to a lesser extent Warren , Buttigieg seemed to glide past the contradictions inherent in describing the killing of 603 American troops in Iraq by Iraqis as a crime akin to terrorism , but of course those soldiers were only there because of the invasion Sanders has repeatedly called on the campaign trail \u201c the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of the United States. \u201d \u201c \u2018 Yeah but what \u2019 s your strategy ? ' \u201d is the safest , lamest , most DC criticism possible , \u201d Sanders foreign policy adviser Matt Duss observed on Twitter . \u201c Trump \u2019 s Iran policy is foolish , dangerous , and driven by hardline ideologues who \u2019 ve been pushing for war for years . Who cares what the strategy is for achieving it . The policy needs to change. \u201d If the ongoing calamity in Iraq does factor into the decisions of Democratic primary voters , it won \u2019 t be the first time . Then-Sen. Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2002 vote to authorize the invasion played a pivotal role in the 2008 Democratic primary , contrasting sharply with Barack Obama \u2019 s opposition , as a state senator at the time , to what he called , \u201c A dumb war . A rash war . A war based not on reason but on passion , not on principle but on politics. \u201d Four years earlier , the capture of Saddam Hussein just one month before the 2004 Iowa caucuses had seemed to tilt the Democratic contest in the opposite direction . That year , as President George W. Bush \u2019 s approval rating surged 9 points following Hussein \u2019 s arrest , Iowa voters turned away from an insurgent , critic of the war , Vermont Gov . Howard Dean , in favor of a more hawkish Senator and decorated veteran , John Kerry , who was seen as more electable in wartime . In the aftermath of Trump \u2019 s strike on Iran \u2019 s leading military figure , Biden and Buttigieg , egged on by conservative commentators , appear to be vying for the mantle of John Kerry 2.0 as each man argues that his prior experience with national security makes him the best alternative to Trump in the general election . On the campaign trail and in social media ads , Biden has stressed his foreign policy credentials , and familiarity with the intricacies of Iran \u2019 s military capabilities . Biden told voters in Iowa on Friday that he doubts that Trump is capable of handling Iran \u2019 s likely retaliation .\nThe prospect of direct conflict with Iran is greater than ever .

We need to stop this endless war. \u201d Asked by Daniella D\u00edaz of CNN if she would have given the order to assassinate the Iranian general .

On Saturday in Iowa, she said that, by killing Suleimani, \u201cDonald Trump has taken us to the brink of war. We don\u2019t need more war in the Middle East, we need to stop endless war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nWATCH: @ewarren\u2019s first on-camera reaction to the killing of Soleimani. @cheyennehaslett follows up by asking why the shift away from calling him a murderer. Warren pivots to instead talk about where Trump is taking this country, calling him \u201creckless\u201d. pic.twitter.com/fqxGcPJDtS \u2014 Tara Prindiville (@taraprindiville) January 4, 2020\n\n\u201cWe have been at war in this region for 20 years now and it has meant thousands of American lives lost and huge costs imposed on our country,\u201d Warren added. \u201cIt also means millions of people in the Middle East who have lost their lives, been injured or displaced. We need to stop this endless war.\u201d Asked by Daniella D\u00edaz of CNN if she would have given the order to assassinate the Iranian general. Warren said no, and added that she would never have precipitated the current crisis, as Trump did, by withdrawing from the multinational nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated by Obama\u2019s secretary of state, John Kerry.\n\nTo @DaniellaMicaela\u2019s Q whether she would\u2018ve ordered the strike, @ewarren continued: \u201cEven though the Iranians had been certified as adhering to the terms of the deal, even though our allies all stayed in the deal and wanted us to stay in the deal...Trump went off on his own...\u201d https://t.co/fSn1mVPiCs pic.twitter.com/x9iajVAyuJ \u2014 Tara Prindiville (@taraprindiville) January 4, 2020\n\nWarren also defended her description of the killing of the Iranian government official an \u201cassassination,\u201d one day after Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, described Sanders\u2019 use of the word as \u201can outrageous thing to say.\u201d\n\nWarren took question after question on Soleimani after not referencing the killing once during her town hall. When pushed on why she called it an assassination, @ewarren responds: \u201cYes, it is...he has ordered the assassination of a high-ranking gov official in the gov of Iran.\u201d pic.twitter.com/nYHskBAxi4 \u2014 Tara Prindiville (@taraprindiville) January 4, 2020",
