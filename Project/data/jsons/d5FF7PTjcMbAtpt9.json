Jason Lewis for voting \u201c to dramatically increase the cost of insurance and kick millions off health care . \u201d\nRep. Jacky Rosen , a Democratic Senate candidate from Nevada , in another ad , highlights Sen. Dean Heller \u2019 s pledge to oppose a Republican attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act , before ultimately backing the effort under pressure from President Trump .\nAnd Democratic House candidate Antonio Delgado of New York has an ad that points to GOP Rep. John Faso \u2019 s vote for repealing the ACA , known as Obamacare , after promising a woman with a brain tumor on video that he would not take away her health care .\nFriday marks the year anniversary of House Republicans \u2019 vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act . It was the first vote of a months-long effort from congressional Republicans to get rid of the law . It ultimately failed in the Senate , but it left many Republicans on record voting to remove millions of Americans from the rolls of the insured \u2014 and Democrats are hammering them for it .\nAfter years of playing defense on health care , Democratic candidates have made it a top issue this election cycle . They are pledging to fix the flaws in Obamacare while targeting Republican attempts to \u201c sabotage \u201d it and take coverage away . And grassroots organizations that protested Republican efforts are keeping up the pressure with events planned around the anniversary .\n\u201c This is going to be a continuing conversation throughout the election , \u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen , of Maryland , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . \u201c I \u2019 m seeing this as an issue in every state . \u201d\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan , of New Mexico , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , told reporters recently , \u201c Republicans are going to have one heck of a time having to explain themselves . \u201d\nLast spring , Democrats warned the repeal vote would have negative political consequences for the GOP . Grassroots groups staged rallies and protests across the country , in support of preserving Obamcare . When the House vote closed on May 4 , 2017 \u2014 it passed by a single vote \u2014 some Democrats began chanting `` Na na na na , hey hey , hey , goodbye ! ''\nDemocrats know what it \u2019 s like to be on the losing side of this issue . During the run-up to the 2010 elections , constituents \u2019 rage \u2014 partly over health care \u2014 drove many Democrats to skip in-person town hall meetings . The party lost 63 House seats and majority control in what President Obama described as a \u201c shellacking. \u201d Republicans spent years promising to repeal the law .\nNow , views on the topic have shifted . Because of Obamacare , roughly 20 million people who were previously uninsured got access to health care . At the height of the repeal debate in the Senate last summer , 60 % of Americans said the federal government is responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all Americans , the highest number in nearly a decade , according to a Pew Research poll .\n\u201c It isn \u2019 t that people fell in love with the ACA \u2014 with the exchanges and mandates and controlled benefits and everything \u2014 they didn \u2019 t , \u201d said Robert J. Blendon , a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University . \u201c They just couldn \u2019 t imagine taking some coverage away from those people . ''\nHad the Republican repeal effort passed both chambers , it would have unraveled many of the law \u2019 s popular consumer protections and overhauled the insurance market . A report from the Congressional Budget Office said that the House-passed bill would lead to 23 million fewer people having health insurance , although the CBO estimated other drafts of the bill went as high as 24 million .\n`` The Democrats don \u2019 t have to run on how well the ACA works \u2026 all they have to say is we \u2019 re not going to let them take the 24 million people off , \u201d Blendon said .\nRecent polls show voters trust Democrats more than Republicans on health care .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t think of a campaign , from the reddest of districts to the bluest of districts , that isn \u2019 t talking about health care repeal and what the administration \u2019 s sabotage would mean to the health care system , \u201d said Jesse Ferguson , a Democratic strategist now working on health care policy who worked at the DCCC in 2010 .\nDemocrats ' strategy is to acknowledge flaws with Obamacare . Rather than repealing it , many are campaigning on the need to repair it by lowering drug costs and premiums and continuing to expand health care coverage .\n\u201c I \u2019 m acknowledging that things need to be fixed , \u201d said Craig , who is running in Minnesota \u2019 s 2nd Congressional District . \u201c ( Republicans ) didn \u2019 t get it done with control of the House , the Senate and the White House . \u201d\nIn New Jersey , Democratic House candidate Mikie Sherrill is campaigning for an open seat now held by a Republican . She said she hasn \u2019 t found anyone in her district who disagrees with the goal of providing quality and affordable health care for everyone .\n\u201c I say that in the progressive parts of the district , the red parts of the district , and I never hear anyone say , \u2018 No we don \u2019 t , \u2019 \u201d she said .\nIn North Dakota , Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is campaigning for re-election against GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer in a state Trump won by 36 points . Cramer is proud of his vote to repeal Obamacare . Still , Heitkamp said she \u2019 ll defend her vote to oppose the \u201c horrible \u201d repeal and replace legislation \u201c any day . \u201d\n\u201c Many , many of the changes that were recommended by the Republicans would have dramatically affected both affordability and accessibility \u201d of health care in North Dakota , Heitkamp said .\nRepublicans may have failed to fully dismantle the law but they have taken other steps to try and blunt it . They used tax reform legislation \u2014 which did pass \u2014 to strike Obamacare \u2019 s \u201c individual mandate , \u201d requiring that everyone buy insurance or face a tax penalty . On Tuesday , Trump 's former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said that decision would drive up costs .\nAnd Trump halted subsidies to insurers that helped bring down out-of-pocket costs for consumers . Congress so far has been unable to reach a compromise to reinstate the subsidies and block premiums from rising in the fall .\nConservatives worry health care could dampen their 2018 prospects , but only because they haven \u2019 t gone far enough in repealing it . Republicans will be on \u201c the losing end of the debate unless they take proactive steps to deliver on the campaign promise that \u2019 s been years in the making , \u201d said Dan Holler , a vice president of Heritage Action , the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation .\n\u201c There \u2019 s obviously been a fundamental shift in the politics of health care and Democrats in many ways feel emboldened , \u201d Holler said . \u201c They feel emboldened not because Obamacare is working\u2026 but Democrats right now are on offense because Republicans haven \u2019 t delivered a policy outcome . \u201d\nOther Republicans think the party should try to make Democrats look out-of-touch by tying them to a `` single-payer , '' government-run health care system .\nIn the House , 122 Democrats have signed onto a single-payer bill now led by the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s deputy chair , Rep.
