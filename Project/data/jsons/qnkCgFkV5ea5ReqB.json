Mr. Romney won the nation \u2019 s suburbs by a narrow margin .\nBut pointing to urban voters for the Republican failure to win last week does not take into account that the Republican ticket also lost big in some rural , mostly white states , like Iowa and New Hampshire .\nAnd there is little proof from the results of the election that urban turnout over all played the decisive role in swing states like Colorado , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia or Wisconsin , where Mitt Romney lost in Mr. Ryan \u2019 s suburban home district .\n\u201c What Paul Ryan misses is that the Republicans have been losing the urban vote for a long , long time , \u201d said Marc Morial , the president and chief executive of the National Urban League . \u201c Now they are losing the suburban vote , too .
