He said Europe and the world are \u201c watching us \u201d and \u201c waiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment , threatened in so many places \u201d .\nHe promised to unite a divided and fractured France , saying : \u201c I will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes . \u201d\nSpeaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago , he said : \u201c Everyone said it was impossible . But they didn \u2019 t know France ! \u201d\nPlay Video 3:08 Who is the new French president , Emmanuel Macron ? \u2013 video\nDespite the wide margin of the final result , Le Pen \u2019 s score nonetheless marked a historic high for the French far right . Even after a lacklustre campaign that ended with a calamitous performance in the final TV debate , she was projected to have taken almost 11m votes , double that of her father , Jean-Marie Le Pen , when he reached the presidential run-off in 2002 . The anti-immigration , anti-EU Front National \u2019 s supporters asserted that the party had a central place as an opposition force in France .\nTurnout was the lowest in more than 40 years . Almost one-third of voters chose neither Macron nor Le Pen , with 12 million abstaining and 4.2 million spoiling ballot papers .\nMacron , who has never held elected office and was unknown until three years ago , is France \u2019 s youngest president . Next Sunday , he will take over a country under a state of emergency , still facing a major terrorism threat and struggling with a stagnant economy after decades of mass unemployment . France is divided after an election campaign in which anti-establishment anger saw the traditional left and right ruling parties ejected from the race in the first round for the first time since the period after the second world war .\nFran\u00e7ois Bayrou , an ex-minister and Macron \u2019 s centrist ally , said : \u201c He is the youngest head of state on the planet [ which ] sends an incredible message of hope . Macron is giving hope to people who had no hope . Hope that maybe we can do something , go beyond the [ left-right ] divide that no longer makes sense . \u201d\nLe Pen swiftly conceded defeat . She said she had won a \u201c historic and massive \u201d score that made her leader of \u201c the biggest opposition force \u201d in France and vowed to radically overhaul her Front National party . Her promise to \u201c transform \u201d the far-right movement left open the possibility that the party could be expanded and renamed in an attempt to boost its electoral chances . It was a major step in the political normalisation of her movement .\nThe outgoing Socialist president , Fran\u00e7ois Hollande , who was once Macron \u2019 s mentor and had appointed him economy minister , said : \u201c His large victory confirms that a very great majority of our citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union and show France is open to the world . \u201d\nOn Monday Hollande embraced his successor as the two men attended a ceremony at Paris \u2019 s Arc de Triomphe to commemorate victory over the Nazis in the second world war . Hollande walked beside Macron to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the monument , where they laid a wreath .\nMacron \u2019 s victory came not only because voters supported his policy platform for free market , pro-business reform , and his promises to energise the EU , coupled with a leftwing approach to social issues . Some of his voters came from other parties across the political spectrum and turned out not in complete support of his programme but to stop the Front National .\nIn a political landscape with a strong hard left and far right , Macron faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche !

Without a majority , he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises .\nAfter the Brexit vote and the election of Trump as US president , the race for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e was the latest election to shake up establishment politics by kicking out the figures that stood for the status quo , ejecting the mainstream parties that have dominated French politics for 50 years and leaving the political novice Macron to do battle with the far right .\nHis victory comes after a bitter campaign with Le Pen in which she accused him of being part of an elite that did not understand ordinary people and he said Le Pen represented the \u201c party of hatred \u201d that wanted a \u201c civil war \u201d in France .
