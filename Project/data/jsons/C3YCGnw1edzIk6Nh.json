According to The New York Times , Rove \u2019 s involvement is part of a larger effort by the Trump campaign to embrace the G.O.P . elites the president professed to shun in 2015 . Over the past two months , Vice President Mike Pence quietly raised $ 6 million from wealthy donors in closed-door meetings , and on Tuesday , 200 bundlers will gather at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. to coordinate fund-raising efforts with the Trump campaign , represented by Parscale and Pence .
