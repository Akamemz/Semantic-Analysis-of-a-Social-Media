''\nFlexing its political muscle on Capitol Hill , the NRA successfully pushed for legislation that effectively ended Rosenberg 's program .\nTo underscore its point , Congress -- in a move led by Jay Dickey , a former gun-rights advocate and Republican legislator from Arkansas -- added this language to the agency 's appropriation : `` None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control . ''\nAt the time , critics in Congress accused the researchers of pursuing an anti-gun agenda and said the CDC 's work was redundant .\nThe language created what Teret called `` a chilling effect '' for nearly all gun-related work at the CDC . Though the agency continues to track gun deaths and injuries , it does little work on how to prevent them .\nMany years later , the National Institutes of Health funded a similar study that triggered the same lightning-bolt response .\nIn 2009 , the NIH study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed .\nTwo years later , Congress added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the CDC to all agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services , including the NIH .\nToday , the NRA maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary .\n`` What works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do n't have access to firearms , '' the NRA 's Arulanandam said , `` not to carry out more studies . ''\nRosenberg , who left the CDC in 1999 , explained that many of the questions that his group was seeking to answer remain open .\nFor example , he said , it 's not clear whether registering and licensing firearms lowers gun violence ; whether allowing people to carry concealed weapons increases or lowers the risk of gun deaths ; or how letting people carry weapons in places such as shopping malls or schools or bars or parks affects the number of deaths .\n`` These are very big questions that we need to know the answer to , '' said Rosenberg , who is now president and CEO of The Task Force for Global Health .\nThere are other private agencies and even partly federally funded programs that have researched these issues .\nBut none was as far-reaching as what Rosenberg 's program did in the 1990s .\nNow that gun violence has been thrust into the forefront of issues on Capitol Hill after last month 's mass shooting at a Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school , the focus has turned to the medical community 's role in the debate .\nLast week , The Washington Post reported on a little-known provision added to the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- better known as Obamacare -- limiting what doctors can ask their patients about firearms in the home .\nWhile the provision does n't forbid doctors from asking about guns , it prohibits health care workers from collecting that information , documenting it and using it for research .\nA similar law in Florida went a step further and would actually penalize doctors if they ask their patients about whether they own a gun , in most cases . A federal judge overturned the law , but Gov .

''\nWhen Adam Lanza unleashed a hail of bullets inside an elementary school on December 14 , ending the lives of 20 young children and six staff members , the debate over America 's gun laws reopened .\nDays later , Obama announced that a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden would create `` real reforms right now . ''\nThat could include a revival of the assault weapons ban , something that Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , has said she plans to introduce . It could also result in executive orders that would bypass the legislative process , Biden said Wednesday .\nWhat is clear , according to Kellermann -- who led research with the now defunct CDC program -- is that the nation has lost valuable time .\n`` Democracy is not served by ignorance and by excluding certain topics , '' he said . `` I think that 's been the real loss in this case .
