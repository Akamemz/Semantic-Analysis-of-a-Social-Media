Lindsey Graham called Thursday for Congress to create a special counsel to probe the FBI and Justice Department , saying evidence is mounting that they treated Hillary Clinton more leniently than they did President Trump during the 2016 election campaign .\nMr. Graham made the call as newly released documents show the extent of anti-Trump sentiment among FBI employees who were instrumental in handling the investigation into Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s secret email server and in launching the Russia investigation that turned into Robert Mueller \u2019 s special counsel probe .\nThe documents released this week \u2014 transcripts of interviews from fired FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page \u2014 show they were determined to prevent Mr. Trump from becoming president and had impeachment on their minds once he did take office .\nMr. Graham took to the Senate floor to say Mr. Mueller has had his chance to deal with Mr. Trump and now it \u2019 s time to turn the microscope the other way .
