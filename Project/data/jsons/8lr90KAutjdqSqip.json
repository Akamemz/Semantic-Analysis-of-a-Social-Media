''\nEven as the ceasefire came into effect , Turkey 's state-owned Anadolu news agency reported early on Friday that Turkish forces killed 21 Syrian troops and destroyed two artillery pieces and two missile launchers , in retaliation of the killing of two Turkish soldiers in Idlib earlier on Thursday .\nSince last December , more than 300 civilians , including at least 100 children , have been killed in Idlib .\nNearly one million people have been internally displaced to the border with Turkey , most of them forced to camp out in the open - the worst humanitarian crisis in Syria 's nine-year-old civil war , according to the United Nations .\nErdogan on Thursday said the two leaders agreed to help these refugees return to their homes .\nTurkey and Russia on Thursday also agreed to establish a secure corridor along a key east-west highway in Syria 's Idlib and hold joint patrols on it as of March 15 .\nIn a joint statement read out by the Turkish and Russian foreign ministers , the two sides said the secure corridor would stretch 6km ( 3.7 miles ) to the north and 6km to the south of the M4 highway .\nThey said their defence ministers would agree on the parameters of the corridor within a week .\nPresidents Erdogan , ( left ) , and Putin shake hands after their joint news conference following their meeting in Moscow , Russia on March 5 , 2020 [ Sefa Karacan/Anadolu ]\nUntil the latest crisis , Putin and Erdogan had managed to coordinate their interests in Syria even though Moscow backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , while Ankara supported the opposition forces .\nEarlier on Thursday , al-Assad accused Turkey 's president of `` supporting terrorists '' .\n`` Erdogan is unable to tell the Turks why he is sending his army to fight in Syria and why his soldiers are being killed there because the issue has nothing to do with Turkish interests but with his Muslim Brotherhood ideology , '' he told the state-owned Russia 24 channel .\nThe Idlib crisis marks the first time Ankara has launched a direct offensive against al-Assad 's forces .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 's Hashem Ahelbarra , reporting from Hatay on the Turkish-Syrian border , said Erdogan managed to get some `` huge concessions '' in the talks with Putin .\n`` I think this is going to be seen as a massive victory for Erdogan , '' Ahelbarra said .

Opposition activists there blamed Russian aircraft for an attack on a rebel-held village , which they said killed at least 15 people , including children , and wounded several others .\nThe Russian military had no immediate comment on the claim , but it has staunchly denied similar previous claims , insisting it has not singled out residential areas .\nDespite Thursday 's breakthrough , hopes for peace among some Syrians remain low .\nRaja Androon , a 65-year-old Syrian from Idlib whose two sons were killed by Syrian government forces , now lives in Antakya in southern Turkey .\n`` The talks may result in less fighting , but I 'm not holding my breath for the Syrian regime to get out of Idlib , '' she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` I hope Idlib will come under autonomous rule , and not fall under Assad 's control .
