A different decision could have affected the health care of millions of Americans. In King v.

It could have ended the subsidies in most states allowing many lower-income Americans to afford the insurance offered through those sites.\n\nAt issue in the case was a phrase in the law stating that the government will subsidize patients in exchanges \"established by the state.\" In King v. Burwell, the question was whether those subsidies should then go to people participating in the exchanges in the 34 states that didn't set up their own \u2014 that is, in states where the exchanges are federally run to some degree.\n\nThere are two broad paths the Supreme court could have taken here, but within those, there is a lot of room for variation:\n\n1. A ruling for Burwell\n\nEverything stays the way it is \u2014 people keep getting their subsidies in all states, regardless of whether the government, the state, or a mix of the two, runs their exchanges.\n\n2. A ruling for King\n\nObamacare customers in states using federal exchanges would have likely lost their subsidies altogether. That means an estimated 6.4 million people could have lost the tax credits that helped them pay for their insurance through the exchanges.\n\nBut there were other potential, more mixed outcomes in which fewer people would have lost their subsidies. Because there were different configurations of federal-state cooperation, residents of some states could have kept their subsidies, while others could have lost them. For example, five states have state-run marketplaces using federal websites \u2014 it was possible that the court could have decided either way on those states, as they use federal resources, even while operating their own state marketplaces.\n\nSo what could have ended up mattering here was the question of what a state-run exchange is.

And depending on how the administration set the bar on what makes a state-run exchange, this path could have led to still more litigation from Obamacare opponents, challenging how the administration set that definition, explains Linda Blumberg at the Urban Institute.\n\nMore Uninsured, Higher Premiums Possible\n\nIn the 16 states (plus the District of Columbia) with state-run exchanges, nothing would have changed with this outcome. But the effects in the other 34 states could have gone beyond just more expensive health care. One study from the Urban Institute estimated that 8.2 million more people would have joined the ranks of the uninsured in this case.
