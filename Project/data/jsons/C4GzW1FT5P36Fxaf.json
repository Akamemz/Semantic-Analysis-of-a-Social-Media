The past decade was brutal for the local press , and the numbers behind the collapse of local newspapers are staggering . In 2006 , American newspapers sold over $ 49 billion in ads , employed more than 74,000 people and circulated to 52 million Americans on weekdays . By 2017 , ad revenues were down to $ 16.5 billion ( a 66 percent drop ) ; the newspaper workforce fell by 47 percent , to just over 39,000 ; and weekday circulation fell below 31 million .\nAt a time when national political news is inescapable , there \u2019 s less local news to be found \u2014 and less interest in local politics from Americans .\nThis shift in media may have a direct effect on how people vote . Local newspapers help protect American democracy by giving people the information they need to hold local government accountable . They also provide an alternative to national news , which often focuses on partisan conflict .\nAs political scientists and communications scholars who study the media \u2019 s influence on voters , we wanted to know whether these changes in the news industry had political effects . In our new study , we show that the loss of local news leads to political polarization , making governing more difficult both locally and nationally .\nWe began with a hunch : If people are consuming more nationalized news when their local newspapers decline , they might become more polarized themselves and vote accordingly . American politics became more polarized along party lines over the past 50 years . National news focuses on that polarization and conflict , covering the partisan fights in Washington and framing politics as a game with winners and losers . In doing so , national news makes the parties seem more different and emphasizes their conflicts .\nWe examined split-ticket voting \u2014 where a person votes for candidates of both parties on Election Day \u2014 as a way to measure polarization in areas where local news is suffering . Historically , Americans have frequently voted for different parties in state and national elections . But split-ticket voting has declined in recent years as politicians and the electorate have become more polarized .\nIn 1992 , for example , voters in more than one-third of the states holding Senate elections elected a senator from a different party than they voted for in the presidential election .

For example , in 2018 , the U.S. House races in Minnesota \u2019 s 1st district , Utah \u2019 s 4th district , and Illinois \u2019 s 13th district were all decided by less than that margin .\nWe considered two explanations for our finding : Either people switched to national news once their local newspaper closed or they lost the information they needed to vote in more local races .\nWe assessed these options by looking at \u201c ballot roll-off , \u201d when voters leave their ballots blank for lower-level offices . If roll-off increased , that would show that people did not feel like they had enough information to vote in state elections . We didn \u2019 t find higher roll-off after newspapers closed .
