Postal Service Inspector General 's Office recommended this past June that the agency consider terminating more than $ 200 million in contracts with Accenture . The recommendation cited an `` absence of business ethics '' by the firm , including a 2011 settlement with the Justice Department to resolve allegations of `` kickbacks '' and `` bid-rigging '' in federal contracts . Accenture , which paid $ 63 million to resolve the claims , denied the allegations .\nThe Obama administration announced last month that it had tapped Accenture to become the lead contractor for Healthcare.gov after cutting ties with CGI Federal , which handled the site 's troubled launch this past Oct. 1 .

Experts interviewed by the Post were divided over whether Accenture was the right choice to tackle the ongoing problems of the site , with one IT consulting firm executive saying Accenture was `` at the top of the stack '' in the industry . However , the same executive also questioned whether Accenture 's relative lack of experience in health care would be an issue .
