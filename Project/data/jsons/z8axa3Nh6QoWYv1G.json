    "content": "The United States found itself involved in a lengthy , divisive , military conflict overseas .\nA surfeit of controversial incidents besieged the U.S. military and confounded official Washington as to what to do . Leaders at the National Security Council argued that local fighters were improving their military skills . As a result , the U.S. could cede more power to them .\nIn other words , the war needed to be \u201c de-Americanized. \u201d Instead , the Defense secretary chose another term : \u201c Vietnamization . \u201d\nThe above scenario obviously isn \u2019 t about the four U.S. soldiers killed earlier this month in Niger . It isn \u2019 t about President Trump \u2019 s decision in August to maintain the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and bolster troop levels there .\nBut what the U.S. is doing in Niger and Chad and Mali and Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and Djibouti and Turkey and Yemen and Jordan and Uganda and Cameroon and South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic and Somalia and Kosovo and Cuba and parts of Syria \u2026certainly echoes Defense Secretary Melvin Laird telling President Richard Nixon the U.S. should \u201c Vietnamize \u201d the battle in southeast Asia .\nThat would denote a shift . Laird asserted that \u201c Vietnamization \u201d properly characterized U.S. involvement going forward . After all , the U.S. didn \u2019 t want an open-ended commitment in Vietnam . Many in Washington wanted to get out as soon as possible .\nThings certainly didn \u2019 t work out that way . The U.S. found itself paralyzed in Vietnam for years . As a result , \u201c Vietnam Syndrome \u201d set in among the public and the nation \u2019 s political leaders . Americans were reluctant to engage overseas .\nIn a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , President Ronald Reagan said that the U.S. lived with Vietnam Syndrome for \u201c too long. \u201d As a result , Reagan said Americans \u201c were told that peace would come if we would simply stop interfering and go home. \u201d Reagan declared \u201c we dishonor the memory of the 50,000 young Americans who died in that cause when we give way to feelings of guilt as if we were doing something shameful . \u201d\nReagan told the VFW that was the \u201c lesson for all of us on Vietnam . If we are forced to fight , we must have the means and the determination to prevail or we will not have what it takes to secure the peace . \u201d\nTwo months ago , Trump made the case to \u201c Afghanize \u201d the fight . The president said Afghan troops would bear \u201c the heaviest burden \u201d in this struggle . He also spoke of the thousands of U.S. troops who \u201c fought and died in Afghanistan. \u201d Trump suggested the U.S. needs to remain engaged in Afghanistan \u201c to secure the cause for which they gave their lives . \u201d\nVietnam was a seminal period in the American experience . It \u2019 s natural to draw parallels between Vietnam and other lengthy military engagements . The U.S. has now been in Afghanistan since shortly after 9/11 .\nHow long should the U.S. stay ? Ironically , military analysts now believe Vietnam isn \u2019 t the model to which people should look when discussing Afghanistan . They note how long the U.S. has remained on the Korean Peninsula .\nThis is ironic . Consider the fact that the 60-plus year U.S. presence there hasn \u2019 t inhibited the possibility of the U.S. facing off with Pyongyang in a nuclear war . Those chances are now as high as ever .\nIn June , the president submitted to Congress a report detailing all of the places the U.S. is involved militarily ( most are listed above ) , information about deployments and justifications for the operations . Most of these missives from the administration to Congress contain a crucial phrase .\nThe letter states the information the president is sending to Capitol Hill is \u201c consistent with the War Powers Resolution , as part of my efforts to keep Congress informed about deployments of the U.S. Armed Forces equipped for combat . \u201d\nNote it states \u201c consistent with \u201d the resolution . The letter doesn \u2019 t state \u201c in compliance with. \u201d No administration of either party has truly acknowledged the resolution since its adoption in 1974 .\nArticle I , Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war . Article II , Section 2 of the Constitution names the president commander in chief . Congress created the resolution as an additional check on the president to curb his war-making authority . This effort backfired as Congress inadvertently ceded more latitude to the president .\nSo short of declaring war somewhere , presidents simply slip Congress a note at regular intervals as to what the U.S. is doing where . Constitutional ? Unclear . \u201c Adhering \u201d to the War Powers Resolution ? Not really . \u201c Consistent with \u201d the resolution ? You bet .\nThink the U.S. is at \u201c war \u201d in Niger ? Then why are there four dead Americans there and what were they doing there ?\nTrump \u2019 s June letter spells it all out . The president told lawmakers that \u201c United States military personnel in the Lake Chad Basin continue to provide a wide variety of support to African partners conducting counterterrorism operations in the region . In Niger , there are about 645 U.S. military personnel deployed to support these missions .\nIn Cameroon , roughly 300 U.S. military personnel are also deployed , the bulk of whom are supporting United States airborne intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance operations in the region . These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security , and they will remain in Cameroon , with the consent of the government of Cameroon , until their support is no longer needed . \u201d\n\u201c The operation has caused us to begin to re-examine force protection in Niger , \u201d said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed , the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee . \u201c We have to re-evaluate what we \u2019 re doing there . \u201d\nFew Americans even knew the U.S. was involved in Niger . Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky , trolled fellow GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham on Twitter after the South Carolina senator told NBC he wasn \u2019 t fully aware of U.S. military operations there .\n\u201c You know you are in too many wars in too many places when even warmonger Lindsay Graham can \u2019 t keep track anymore , \u201d Paul tweeted .\nThis is why Sen. Tim Kaine , D-Va. , has long argued that the 2001 and 2002 authorizations Congress approved for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are calcified . He \u2019 s pushed for a retrenched Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) for years now .\n\u201c We were in Niger to deal with an ISIS threat , \u201d Kaine said . \u201c It \u2019 s time for Congress to finally revisit the authorization which is badly out of date and have a debate on full view of the American public about all the different countries where we are in engaged in military action right now . \u201d\nLawmakers of both parties have flirted with such a proposal for several years . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , convenes a hearing Monday about a potential new AUMF with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis .\n\u201c It is perhaps more important than ever that we have a sober national conversation about Congress \u2019 s Constitutional role in authorizing the use of military force , \u201d Corker said .\nCongress felt it was in the dark a few weeks ago about what went down in Niger and demanded more information from the Pentagon . Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain , R-Ariz. , threatened to subpoena military officials after they were less than forthcoming about Niger .\nThat prompted Mattis to pay McCain a courtesy call at his office . When asked in the hall if he hustled to Capitol Hill because of McCain \u2019 s subpoena warning , Mattis stopped in his tracks in a corridor of the Russell Senate Office Building .\nThe Defense secretary than ventured over to talk with Graham . After that conclave , Graham offered perhaps the most sober assessment yet about U.S. involvement overseas and perhaps why Congress is mulling a new AUMF .\n\u201c This war is getting hot in places where it \u2019 s been cool , \u201d he said about the broader war on terrorism .\n\u201c The war is beginning to morph , \u201d Graham also said , noting that there would be more -- \u201c not less \u201d -- operations like the one in Niger .\nSo the U.S. finds itself in Niger and Mali and Cameroon and Chad and the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo and a host of other places few Americans have ever heard of -- to say nothing about Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe perfect solution would be the \u201c Vietnamization \u201d of these conflicts as suggested so long ago by Defense Secretary Melvin Laird .
