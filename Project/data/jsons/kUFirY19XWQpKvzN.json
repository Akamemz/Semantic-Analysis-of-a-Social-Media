But she has one very serious problem : The Vermont senator is n't giving up .\nClinton and her husband have barnstormed across California at a furious pace in recent days -- seeking to avoid yet another humiliating defeat by Sanders on the same night she should easily win the delegates needed to go past the 2,383 mark and clinch the nomination .\n`` I 'm very proud of the campaign we 're running here , and I believe , on Tuesday , I will have decisively won the popular vote and I will have decisively won the pledged delegate majority , '' Clinton said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''\nBy all objective measures , she and her allies argue that the race is over . The delegate math , the money , the millions of votes in her column -- all point to her inevitability as the nominee .\nSanders , however , shows no sign that he is preparing to exit the stage .\nFacing a strong possibility that he could carry in California , he vowed , in no uncertain terms this weekend , to lead his `` movement '' on to the convention in Philadelphia .\nAt a news conference in L.A. 's Little Tokyo Saturday , he railed against the press and the news networks for counting superdelegates in their tallies .\n`` It is extremely unlikely that Secretary Clinton will have the requisite number of pledged delegates to claim victory on Tuesday night , '' Sanders said . `` At the end of the nominating process , no candidate will have enough pledged delegates to call the campaign a victory . That will be dependent upon superdelegates . In other words , the Democratic National Convention will be a contested convention . ''\nThe first female presidential nominee of a major political party could find herself shadowed by Sanders ' intensive campaign to sway hundreds of superdelegates despite winning fewer contests and votes .\nSome Democrats worry that would put the Democratic Party at a disadvantage by making it harder for Clinton to unify the party and turn her full attention to Donald Trump .\nFrom a pure mathematical perspective , the Democratic Primary in Puerto Rico Sunday leaves Clinton on the verge of becoming the nominee , 29 delegates shy of the magic number , according to CNN estimates . On Tuesday , 694 delegates will be at stake in the Democratic contests -- including 475 in California alone , but Clinton is likely to win many of them .\nWhile the math is not on his side , Sanders showed defiance and determination as he swept through California all weekend , charging Trump with trying to divide the country , and Clinton with advocating for `` small , incremental changes '' when `` We want to transform this nation . ''\nA robust showing Tuesday could give Sanders a strong closing argument in his pitch to superdelegates .\nSpeaking for more than an hour Saturday night outside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the flame of the Olympic torch flickered brightly above him , he urged his followers to dismiss those who claim his path is impossible .\n`` If we can win , and win big here in California and in the other states , and in Washington D.C. , we are going to go into the Democratic convention with enormous momentum , '' Sanders told thousands of young supporters , many of whom were wearing `` Bernie or Bust '' buttons . `` With your help , I believe , we will come out with the nomination . ''\nFor Sanders , the long Democratic primary is coming to an end amid feelings of astonishment and regret . When he launched his presidential bid a year ago , advisers say , winning was n't his chief goal . He wanted to make sure Clinton had a competitive race . And that , he has done in spades .\nWhile advisers say he is serious about taking the primary fight to the Democratic convention , he also is mindful of keeping his pledge to keep Trump from winning the presidency . He has yet to reconcile those competing forces , aides say , but that rests at the heart of what he decides to do next .\nSanders refuses to say what his goal would be if he does not win the nomination . He will not even engage on those kinds of questions at this point in the process .\nAdvisers say he is intent on trying to change the Democratic nominating process , particularly the superdelegate system and the series of closed primaries in states across the country . But that could be a tall order , considering he just joined the party to run for president .\nWhile this week will almost certainly decide the race , Sanders ' supporters insist that it will result in nothing more than a mathematical muddle . Whatever the networks decide to do in terms of calling the race , Sanders adviser Tad Devine said , `` I do n't think that 's going to affect things . ''\n`` The networks or the press can characterize what happens in any way they like -- you guys have a right to do that -- and so do we , '' he said .\nSanders ' argument for continuing on , Devine said , `` is pretty straightforward that the delegates that have been elected by voters -- no one has enough of them to claim the nomination of the party . ''\n`` So if you 're going to win the nomination of the party you 're going to win it with superdelegates , and even the Democratic National Committee -- officially , their spokesperson -- is out on the record saying that superdelegate 's votes should not officially be counted until the convention itself , '' Devine said .\nSanders ' advisers also note that regardless of the results on Tuesday night\u2014when voters go to the polls in California , Montana , New Jersey , New Mexico , North Dakota and South Dakota\u2014the Vermont senator intends to compete in Washington D.C. on June 14 when it holds the final contest of the primary season .\nThey believe they have a strong case to make to superdelegates that Sanders has gained strength over the course of the primary process while Clinton 's candidacy has weakened .\nThey note that while Clinton , for example , dominated in large states with diverse populations early in the process , polls show Sanders leading Clinton among young minority voters in California by a wide margin . Beyond that , Sanders has continued to pound the argument that potential general election matchups show that he would be a stronger candidate against Trump .\n`` If the Democratic leadership wants a campaign that will not only retain the White House and regain the Senate and win governor 's chairs all over this country , we are that campaign , '' Sanders said at a rally in San Diego Sunday night .\nClinton has pointed out that in 2008 , she was in Sanders ' position : in second place after a hard-fought campaign against Barack Obama .\n`` By some standards , I actually led a little bit in the popular vote , but I fell a little short in the pledged delegates , '' she said on `` State of the Union . '' `` So I had a decision to make . A lot of my supporters said , hey , let 's keep going , let 's make sure that we go to the convention . I said , no .
