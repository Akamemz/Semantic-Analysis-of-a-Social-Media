    "content": "In the immediate aftermath of the Iowa caucus , both Democratic candidates and their supporters have become engaged in an argument over who 's more progressive . That in itself would surely be a good thing\u2014far better than competing over who 's most moderate . But the way the Clinton team is initially pursuing their side of the argument is both inherently self-contradictory , and unlikely to sufficiently connect with and motivate voters in the general election , should she be the nominee .\nThe two problems are not unrelated . The self-contradictory argument is founded in her self-branding as \u201c a progressive who gets things done. \u201d When it 's rolled out into an argument against Sanders it becomes : ( a ) she 's really more progressive than Sanders , and ( b ) she can get things done , because she 's not as wild-eyed\u2014i.e . as progressive\u2014as Sanders is . When Sanders challenges the obvious contradiction here , its unsustainability forces Clinton 's fall-back into the second problem : Clinton 's response is to treat anything Sanders says to challenge her argument as an attack against President Obama . That may be a savvy way to win the primary , but a profoundly counter-productive approach in the long run .\nDo n't let me put words in Clinton 's mouth . Here 's how she responded in CNN 's town hall when Anderson Cooper asked her about being a moderate or a progressive :\nI said that I 'm a progressive who likes to get things done . And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign , Barack Obama would not be a progressive , Joe Biden would not be a progressive , Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive , even the late , great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive .\nTwitter chatter aside , when it comes to judging who 's more progressive than who , political scientists have an app for that\u2014at least for those who 've served in Congress , as Sanders and Clinton both have . It 's the DW-Nominate first dimension , scaled from +1 to -1 , which explains the lion 's share of how members vote . [ Explanation|Data ] . For the two years when they served in the Senate together , Sanders had a score of -.717 , making him far and away the most liberal member . Number two , Sheldon Whitehouse had a score of -.507 , while number 15 , Hillary Clinton had a score of -.403 . The difference between Sanders ' score and Clinton 's was greater than the difference between Clinton and Evan Bayh , the second-most conservative member of the Democratic caucus at the time . So in short , the difference between them in terms of who is most progressive is both objective and huge .\nThe difference can be seen internationally as well . Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist , and regularly points to countries that fully embody that philosophy , such as the Nordic countries of Denmark and Sweden . These serve as objective embodiments of what his politics aims to achieve\u2014and they can be used to contrast with Clinton 's objectives as well . In his groundbreaking book , The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism , G\u00f8sta Esping-Andersen identified three distinctly different models for welfare state organization , each driven by a different logic . The socialist or social democratic model seen in Nordic countries is based on the logic of social solidarity , to provide maximal protections for all ; the conservative model , typified by Germany and seen elsewhere throughout continental Europe , aims to consolidate the existing social order and its hierarchical relations in various ways ; the liberal model , typified by English-speaking countries from Britain to the U.S. , Canada and Australia , aims to deal with imperfections in the market system with minimal interference to the basic system . As I explained in an article here about Sanders ' campaign last June :\nSanders wants to move the U.S. more in the direction of Scandinavia , just as he \u2019 s openly stated . Clinton , in contrast , with her market-oriented emphasis , simply wants to strengthen the existing liberal welfare state structure . We can best think of comparing where Sanders and Clinton would take us by looking at the results these two models produce , and when we do this , we find that the social democratic welfare states consistently outperform the liberal ones . Most notably , they produce the least inequality and poverty , and the highest rates of labor force participation . The dependency these robust welfare states are supposed to breed is simply a figment of the imagination .\nAt the time I was making the crucial point that socialist/social democratic welfare states produce objectively better results than liberal ones do . Here I simply add that they are objectively more progressive as well , across a range of issues . This is what reality tells us\u2014not Bernie Sanders .\nWhat Clinton was trying to do in the passage I quoted\u2014and what she said next\u2014was to wholly occupy the space of \u201c progressive \u201d and cast Sanders as a divisive voice . But Sanders himself , in that same town hall , struck a decidedly affable tone on the same subject\nSome of my best friends are moderates . I love moderates . But you ca n't be a moderate and a progressive . They are different .\nIf it 's somehow a secret that Clinton has moved left in response to Sanders , it 's the worst-kept secret in D.C . When Sanders takes note of it , that 's just what he 's doing\u2014taking note . He 's not attacking her , he 's not making things up , and he 's not setting himself up as the world 's sole authority on who is or is not a progressive Indeed , he 's often said that he and Clinton share much in common , even as there are sharp differences as well .\nClinton 's response is defensive overkill\u2014entirely understandable , for someone who 's been in the rightwing crosshairs for over 25 years . But overkill , nonetheless . More to the point , however , it 's counterproductive in the long run , and she really needs to rethink her approach . Her plan seems to be to be ruthlessly effective in mobilizing elite party and near-party support , particularly with women and minorities , to maximize her existing advantages with such groups . When she gets endorsements from groups like Planned Parenthood , or large blocks of minority congress members , that 's precisely what 's she 's doing But doing this all in a \u201c How can you question me ? \u201d manner does not do a lot to attract first-time , marginal or disaffected voters , whose support will be absolutely crucial for Democratic success\u2014not just in the general election , but beyond that , in getting anything done .\nThe idea that Clinton 's policies are more practical than Sanders ' flies in the face of the whole history of GOP obstructionism that Obama has faced . The real winner of the \u201c get things done \u201d contest will be whichever candidate can be most successful in weakening , and ultimately overcoming , the GOP 's stranglehold in Congress\u2014and that will mean mobilizing the constituency that Sanders is speaking to best , including women and minorities whose less alienated counterparts may favor Clinton , but who need a different approach to overcome their profound skepticism .\nThis is not just my opinion , drawn out of thin air , my hot take on the situation . It 's a clear consequence of the argument made Democracy Corps pollster Stan Greenberg in his recently-published book , America Ascendant : A Revolutionary Nation 's Path to Addressing Its Deepest Problems and Leading the 21st Century . Greenberg has a long history with Clintons\u2014James Carville is his co-principal at Democracy Corps\u2014so no one should think he 's shilling for Bernie Sanders . But he does have a long history of paying attention to economical progressive voter sentiments that other pollsters routinely overlook . In fact , that 's part of the reason Bill Clinton became president in the first place . And it 's also why his arguments implicitly support Bernie Sanders ' efforts in the current campaign\u2014and could support Hillary Clinton , too , if she took them more seriously to heart , and shifted the nature of her argument .\nGreenberg , whose new book \u201c America Ascendant \u201d argues that the nation will soon be \u201c exceptional again \u201d because of its cultural diversity , argued that the Democrats shouldn \u2019 t be afraid to now advocate for \u201c very bold policy changes. \u201d In an interview with the Huffington Post , Greenberg said that he was pleasantly surprised by the degree to which the all the Democratic candidates had embraced such boldly progressive policy prescriptions thus far . But speaking of Vice President Joe Biden \u2019 s urging for Democrats to run on President Obama \u2019 s legacy as he announced his decision not to run for president , Greenberg argued that a third Obama term is not what voters want , despite the President \u2019 s recent proclamations . \u201c The Democratic Party is waiting for a president who will articulate the scale of the problems we face and challenge them to address it , \u201d Greenberg argued . \u201c The problem the president has had is that he \u2019 s not tried to educate the country on how deep the downside is , \u201d Greenberg said , referring to Obama \u2019 s selling of his domestic agenda . \u201c He was trying to tell the country that we \u2019 re on an upward path without being honest , leveling with them about how big a price we have [ to pay ] in the short term and how much government has to do in order to get us onto a different path . \u201d\nThis is almost exactly the same way that Sanders views and talks about Obama 's accomplishments . Again , in the CNN town hall , after first acknowledging differences he has with Obama\u2014the TPP trade agreement specifically\u2014Sanders went on :\nOn the other hand , let 's be very clear . And I got a little bit upset that our Republicans friends suffer from a very serious illness called amnesia . ( LAUGHTER ) SANDERS : They forgot what the economy of this country was like seven years ago when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month , when we were running up a $ 1.4 trillion deficit , and by the way , the world 's financial system was on the verge of collapse . President Obama and Vice President Biden have taken us a very , very long way from those dismal days . Are we where we want to be today ? No . But we have come a long way and President Obama deserves an enormous amount of credit for that .\nSo there you have it\u2014the Clinton 's first national pollster and Bernie Sanders have almost identical views of Obama 's accomplishment\u2014and what needs to happen next . And so could Hillary Clinton , if she choose a truly pro-active way of engaging in the primary debate that 's now unfolding . Trying to defend her past , and wrong-foot Sanders with word games , relying on a framework of shared assumptions with the establishment pundit/media world may well be enough to win her the nomination\u2014but not in a way that energizes and mobilizes the ascendant electorate that Greenberg writes about , and that Democrats absolutely must to have in order to govern .\nLet me cite one other voice advancing the same argument , author Jedediah Purdy . He first situates Sanders ' democratic socialism internationally , as I 've done , as well noting \u201c much of his 'socialism ' is updated New Deal and Great Society liberalism. \u201d He then explains what distinguishes Sanders ' effort , in contrast\u2014not opposition\u2014to Obama :\nThe Sanders campaign , if it succeeds , will build both a movement and a cohort\u2014a political generation\u2014around the ideas and policies of this new American socialism . The voters , the networks and above all , the ideas that the campaign is cultivating will remain for other candidates to tap and develop , at all levels of government , from city councils and state legislatures to presidential elections . This is very different from anything Barack Obama did .... Anyone who participated in the 2008 campaign can remember the heartfelt sense of being part of something , of moving history a little . But the Obama campaigns were ultimately about the candidate : his intelligence , charisma , integrity , and almost preternatural rhetorical gifts . After the long darkness of the Bush years , he brought alive the wish for progress , solidarity , and unity around a better version of the country . Nothing he said was unfamiliar ; it was just that he said it\u2014embodied it\u2014so well . Those campaigns gave a generation knowledge of how a movement feels , but not what a movement is . Viewed hopefully , the Sanders campaign is the next stage of maturation in a rebirth of American progressivism . This time , people understand that no personality , however compelling , can ever change a country . Youthful progressive politics is growing up .\nThis is the deeper story of progress that Sanders has to tell\u2014a story not just about progressive ideas , or policies or values , but a progressive development of progressive politics itself . It 's just this sort of long-term story that 's essential for helping to make sense of the struggle we 're engaged in , and making sense of any struggle is always crucial for attaining victory .\nThe challenge for Clinton is not to engage defensively as she has been doing , but to really articulate her own deep story of how she sees us getting where we need to be . As long as Clinton focuses on turning hardcore Obama voters against Sanders , she may think she 's locking up the nomination , but it 's a tragically short-term way of thinking ( doomed to fail when it comes to governance ) , as well as being disingenuous . In reality , Sanders has long been more in tune with their concerns\u2014as reflected in a still-small but significant number of thoughtful supporters and endorses , like Keith Ellison , Raul Grijalva , Nina Turner , Ben Jealous , Shaun King and Killer Mike . Equally , if not more importantly , he realizes the need to empower & engage them beyond the election itself , just as Purdy described .\nIt should be noted , there 's an element of truth in Clinton 's argument . The reality is that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were ideologically quite similar\u2014neo-liberals who strove to adapt to Reaganism rather than challenge it fundamentally . While both were able to get some things done and inspire intense personal loyalty , both produced historic midterm loses of power two years after their first elections . A discouraged , demoralized Democratic base and a shrunken electorate were the reasons why , and there 's no reason\u2014up to now\u2014to believe that Hillary Clinton would do any better .\nThat 's her real challenge : demonstrate how she 'd build a stronger movement beyond herself than either her husband or Obama did . That 's the standard that she has to meet in order for her argument that she 'd be more effective to make sense . Because the existing Congress would not let her be any more effective than Sanders . Hence , the real pragmatism argument revolves around mobilizing voters and keeping them engaged for the long haul , which is what Sanders has made the foundation of his campaign . Unless Clinton finds her own credible counter-proposal to this\u2014and begins living it\u2014the argument over who 's more progressive will not be rooted in reality , or directed to the future .\nFuture-focused . Reality-based . That 's what Sanders ' argument has been , notwithstanding all the establishment spin to the contrary . If Clinton wants to beat him , she should respond in kind . If she does , the party and the country will be better for it , no matter which candidate wins .",
