    "content": "At first blush , the news about U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions looked bad . At second blush , it looked worse . At third blush , I got tired of blushing and ran outside to cool my face with fresh snow . But then things started to settle . With most Russia-related stories these days , especially ones in The New York Times and The Washington Post , the best initial reaction is heavy skepticism . That way you aren \u2019 t surprised when embarrassing editorial disclaimers appear above stories that Russia hacked a Vermont utility or spread \u201c fake news \u201d via dozens of U.S. websites from Drudge to Truthdig , and you read past the headline of stories like \u201c Trump Aides Had Contact With Russian Intelligence . \u201d\nOn the other hand , lies are lies , and lies under oath are even bigger lies , regardless of what they \u2019 re about\u2014Russia or height or size of fish . So the question is simple : did Sessions perjure himself , and was some sort of cover-up going on ?\nTo back up for a second , here is an overview of the controversy . On Wednesday night , The Washington Post reported the following : \u201c Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) spoke twice last year with Russia \u2019 s ambassador to the United States , Justice Department officials said , encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump \u2019 s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions \u2019 s confirmation hearing to become attorney general . \u201d\nSo what gives ? Former president George W. Bush chief White House ethics lawyer Richard W.

( 3 ) Sessions wasn \u2019 t colluding with Moscow , but decided to lie about contacts with Russians .\nI dismissed Hypothesis 1 . If you \u2019 re conspiring with Moscow , then you at least try to be sneaky about things . Maybe meeting your co-plotter in your Senate office is so obvious that it \u2019 s a brilliant fake , but\u2014really .
