( Lucas Jackson/Reuters )\nThe prognosis was dark , the response fast and furious . \u201c People our age have never experienced American prosperity in our adult lives \u2014 which is why so many millennials are embracing Democratic socialism , \u201d wrote journalist Charlotte Alter , sharing her Time profile of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter . Her reformulation of the congresswoman \u2019 s words quickly became a flashpoint online .\nPoint : The economy \u2019 s booming . Millennials are lazy , vain things that pay up for Instagrammable experiences and anything avocado . They live in their parents \u2019 basements because they can \u2019 t be bothered to pay rent , or a mortgage . Counterpoint ( offered by AOC and crew ) : Millennials are destitute because they \u2019 ve been screwed by the Boomers . They \u2019 re strangled by the high cost of education and health care , and by an uneven economic recovery . Business is roaring , but only a select few enjoy its fruits .\nWhich do you think resonates more with young Americans ? Defenders of free markets could win this debate on the merits . Unemployment is down , and GDP growth last year was around 3 percent , the precise number depending on which measure you prefer to use . Yet anyone paying attention knows that Millennials aren \u2019 t buying it . Their skepticism of capitalism is now common knowledge .\nAt least partly because of this , some business leaders , such as Bridgewater \u2019 s Ray Dalio , are hedging their bets . Absent significant reforms to capitalism , \u201c some form of revolution \u201d might be around the corner . Is that wrong ? A seemingly endless series of polls would appear to show growing support for socialism ( and declining support for capitalism ) among the Millennial generation and the similarly liberal college students and teenagers who compose Generation Z . In 2020 , these two cohorts will account for 37 percent of the voting-age population .\nHowever , polls that suggest growing Millennial support for socialism seem to generate more alarm than the truth would warrant . Take , for instance , an Axios survey that found in January that 61 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 51 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds had a positive reaction to socialism . While this result indicates the dissipation of a taboo on the use of that label , 58 percent of both cohorts also viewed capitalism in a favorable light . Along similar lines , an Axios/Harris Survey in February showed that 49.6 percent of Millennials and Gen Zers would prefer to live in a socialist country \u2014 much lower than the 73.2 percent and the 67.1 percent , who , respectively , support universal health care and free college tuition .\nThis presents a mixed bag . There is stronger support for expanding government programs than for \u201c socialism , \u201d which might just be another buzzword for progressive policies anyway . And as striking as high levels of support for those policies may be , it \u2019 s not unreasonable to predict that survey questions framed in terms of their cost could significantly lower those numbers . Still , the general Millennial preference for these proposals can not just be wished away .\nThe conservative response has largely been to say something about Venezuela or the Soviet Union . Although this is , again , correct on the merits , anyone who has talked socialism with a left-wing college student knows to expect a familiar rejoinder : Venezuela and the USSR don \u2019 t represent true socialism , and instead we should look to Sweden and Denmark . The more daring might even counter that Stalinism was bad but capitalism has its own body count , as author Mike Davis claimed in a Jacobin interview last October .\nSo if socialism to Millennials is Denmark , not Venezuela , \u201c the right answer is not that Denmark is hell \u2014 it is not hell \u2014 but the right answer is that in fact for Denmark to work , the whole original socialist model had to be reformed in a way that empowered entrepreneurship , \u201d argued the economist Edward Glaeser during a lecture last year . To boot , these Millennials , he said , are awfully confident that we \u2019 d resemble Sweden more than we would Greece . Disabusing them of these misconceptions is a logical first step .\nBut it would be a mistake to ignore the general Millennial dissatisfaction with current economic conditions . As Michael Hobbes has noted at HuffPost , studies link higher unemployment with notably lower starting salaries ; members of the class of 2009 could expect to earn close to $ 60,000 less over ten years than those who graduated before the financial crisis . Ocasio-Cortez , Boston University \u2019 11 , speaks for the generation that ventured into the job market during the recession . Recovery be damned , that leaves an im-pression near impossible to erase from the political consciousness of that generation , which maybe explains the nearly tenfold increase in membership that the Democratic Socialists of America have enjoyed over the past three years .\nInterestingly , dissatisfaction with the status quo hasn \u2019 t benefited the DSA only ; it \u2019 s also put wind in the sails of Millennial advocates of urban development . CityLab called 2018 \u201c the Year of the YIMBY , \u201d referring to pro-development activists who push their local officials to approve zoning deregulation in hopes of increasing the supply of housing and therefore lowering rents . Minneapolis became the movement \u2019 s first success when its city council voted to eliminate single-family zoning in December . Progressive supporters touted the plan \u2019 s potential to fight racism , climate change , and economic inequality \u2014 but that shouldn \u2019 t obscure a clear victory for free markets .\nThe national conversation about Millennials and capitalism surrounds the big-ticket items that we hear about all the time . However , Millennials also care strongly about pocketbook expenses and everyday conveniences , something that proponents of capitalism would be well advised to exploit . If Amazon stifles competition and mistreats its workers , you wouldn \u2019 t know it based on Gen Z and Millennial spending habits . According to one survey , 77 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds would give up alcohol if they had to choose between that and an Amazon subscription . A litany of scandals appears incapable of putting an end to Uber \u2019 s popularity with Millennials . And although teens might describe the owners of Chick-fil-A as homophobic , the fast-food chain toppled Starbucks as their favorite restaurant across all levels of income last year .\nThe disconnect between that urban-Millennial libertarian impulse and the generation \u2019 s leftist inclinations offers a tantalizing opportunity . Leaders willing to go to bat for the gig economy might reap political rewards . That said , Gen Z might be even more socially progressive than the Millennials . Gen Zers show up at the march , shift consumer preferences to match their values ( even if that \u2019 s not always true ) , and view politics in terms of justice . To them , for instance , climate change isn \u2019 t just an existential threat to the planet ; it \u2019 s also a source of racial and economic inequality .\nThe Green New Deal pledges \u2014 among many other things \u2014 a new social contract to roll back these injustices . It also throws into relief the trade-off between free markets , on the one hand , and significant government action to restrict carbon emissions in the United States , on the other . Generation Z might get on board with the latter option , perhaps without really considering the alternatives . And that is in part because few alternatives existed until Republican members of Congress had to start rebutting arguments for the GND , even as young voters across both parties were significantly more likely than older ones to consider climate change a problem . Failure on the right to coalesce around market-friendly solutions \u2014 such as a version of Lamar Alexander \u2019 s \u201c New Manhattan Project \u201d or even the carbon-dividends plan endorsed by thousands of economists \u2014 might just push young voters toward the GND by default .\nMore than political necessity , though , the moral case for capitalism must take center stage . Teenagers coming of age in today \u2019 s political climate know only an ascendant socialist Left and a conservative movement increasingly influenced by skeptics of free markets , such as Tucker Carlson , who see many of capitalism \u2019 s proponents as obsequious worshipers of free markets . It has become clear that capitalism needs defenders from the left and the right , especially given that three in ten Republican 18- to 24-year-olds hold a positive view of socialism . The critics provide food for thought and ideas for reform . But what remains practically ignored in today \u2019 s politics is the most essential argument of all , that free-market capitalism has drastically improved the standard of living , especially for the poor .\nAnd so , even as Millennials see themselves rowing against the current with Gatsbyesque futility , they might still be receptive to a message that favors capitalism . Gen Z , maybe more so . An episode from another Fitzgerald novel , This Side of Paradise , shows why .
