If we simply require the unemployed to volunteer 20 hours a week at a non-profit , the unemployment rolls would drop and those volunteering would develop skills and create job networks .\n5 . Allow companies to bring back foreign profits . American companies have parked more than a trillion dollars overseas because the money was made abroad and has been taxed by another country . The U.S. uniquely taxes it again and does so at one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world . If we want to jump-start the economy , jobs , and thus tax revenue , companies should be allowed to return their profits at a lower rate ( say , 10 percent ) if at least half the money is spent on new U.S. jobs or capital investment .\nTo cut our deficit and jump-start our economy , we need creative , bipartisan thinking . By adopting ideas like these , we can begin to meet sequestration goals without raising taxes or cutting entitlements . These are common-sense solutions that will help our nation balance the budget and put the U.S. back on the path to prosperity",
