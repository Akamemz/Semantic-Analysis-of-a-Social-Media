( Leah Millis/Reuters )\nMaking the click-through worthwhile : Everything you need to know about newly announced Cory Booker that his fan base won \u2019 t tell you , some good news on the job-creation front even with the government shutdown , and some absolutely bonkers state regulations about licensing for certain jobs .\nNew Jersey senator Cory \u201c Call Me Spartacus \u201d Booker is running for president , to the surprise of no one who \u2019 s been paying attention for the past three years or so .\nIn a political era that seems long ago , Cory Booker was one of the more interesting figures in the Democratic party . He began his career by taking on an established Democratic machine , and failing in his first bid to be mayor of Newark . Incumbent Sharpe James was the old guard using every strong-arm tactic in the book to keep power and the city \u2019 s appalling status quo , and Booker was the young , fresh-faced Rhodes scholar determined to show that city government could be more than just a corrupt , favor-dispensing fiefdom .\nAfter being elected mayor four years after his first attempt , Booker quickly became master of the dramatic announcement . Perhaps his biggest was in September 2010 , when he joined then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on The Oprah Winfrey Show , to accept an eye-popping gift : $ 100 million to reform Newark Public Schools , with local philanthropists and others matching it and raising it to $ 200 million . Few big city mayors have ever had a day that good .\nA study completed in 2017 found that the Zuckerberg gift was neither a complete failure nor a rousing success : Student test scores in the city improved dramatically in English but stayed about the same in math . Some complained that a portion of the lucrative gift went to $ 1,000-per-day consultants . But by 2013 , Booker was already off to the Senate .\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign , Booker didn \u2019 t just murmur disagreements with the way the Obama campaign attacked Romney \u2019 s work in the private sector , he denounced it .\n\u201c I have to just say , from a very personal level , I \u2019 m not about to sit here and indict private equity , \u201d Mr. Booker said . \u201c To me , it \u2019 s just we \u2019 re getting to a ridiculous point in America , especially that I know I live in a state where pension funds , unions and other people are investing in companies like Bain Capital . If you look at the totality of Bain Capital \u2019 s record , they \u2019 ve done a lot to support businesses , to grow businesses . And this to me , I \u2019 m very uncomfortable with. \u201d \u201c The last point I \u2019 ll make is this kind of stuff is nauseating to me on both sides , \u201d Mr. Booker continued . \u201c It \u2019 s nauseating to the American public . Enough is enough . Stop attacking private equity . Stop attacking Jeremiah Wright . \u201d\nBut within a few days , Booker backtracked almost completely , releasing a video that was such a complete reversal that some of us compared it to a hostage tape , with Booker being punished by his party \u2019 s Ayatollahs for blasphemy against their deity . It was a key early indicator that Booker was willing to defy his party to stand up for what he believed was right . . . until it became difficult .\nAt the end of that year , the New York Times noticed that the social-media star mayor had succeeded a lot in promoting himself but not so much in improving daily life in his troubled city :\nWhen snow blanketed this city two Christmases ago , Mayor Cory A. Booker was celebrated around the nation for personally shoveling out residents who had appealed for help on Twitter . But here , his administration was scorned as streets remained impassable for days because the city had no contract for snow removal . Last spring , Ellen DeGeneres presented Mr. Booker with a superhero costume after he rushed into a burning building to save a neighbor . But Newark had eliminated three fire companies after the mayor \u2019 s plan to plug a budget hole failed . In recent days , Mr. Booker has made the rounds of the national media with his pledge to live on food stamps for a week . But his constituents do not need to be reminded that six years after the mayor came into office vowing to make Newark a \u201c model of urban transformation , \u201d their city remains an emblem of poverty .\nBlunt assessments of his time as mayor of Newark concluded that \u201c Booker cared more about the optics of a social media moment than actually delivering on basic city services \u201d and \u201c Newark has a steep climb before anyone deems it the model city Booker envisioned . \u201d\nYou probably recall Cory Booker \u2019 s stories of his old friend T-Bone , who probably doesn \u2019 t exist . He raves about the joy of pedicures . He \u2019 s been vegan since 2014 . His very limited release of his tax returns revealed that he made more than $ 1.3 million in paid speeches while being mayor , and getting $ 700,000 as part of a confidential separation agreement from his old law firm \u2014 a firm that just happened to have contracts with two city agencies . Despite all of this , Booker gets some of the most glowing coverage in the Senate , and it is hard to overstate how thoroughly Booker can charm the reporters sent to profile him . In 2014 , the Daily Beast raved about his \u201c Christ-like quality . \u201d\nOnce Booker entered the Senate , he got somewhat more predictable and partisan in his stances . A Republican senator once said to me , paraphrasing , that he actually liked working with Cory Booker on legislation because Booker wasn \u2019 t a partisan jerk . But in order to win the Democratic presidential nomination , Booker was going to have to act like a partisan jerk , and this Republican senator predicted that this wasn \u2019 t going to turn out well for him , because he believed that this would only make Booker come across as an inauthentic partisan jerk .\nYear by year , Booker stopped being the genuinely surprising and unpredictable urban reformer and became the guy who tries too hard to get his party \u2019 s base to love him . He tends to shout his speeches :\nAnd then Booker \u2019 s shouting just kept going on , and on , and on . He had to quote or cite Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln and Maya Angelou and John F. Kennedy . Towards the end , he tried to get the audience to chant with his punctuating phrase , \u201c we will rise ! \u201d Unfortunately , his verbiage in between the chant opportunities dragged on so long , the audience forgot they were supposed to join in .\nIn the Trump era , Booker quickly realized that his party had absolutely no interest in nominating a lawmaker who had cultivated a bipartisan image , and so he had to transform himself into the Trump administration \u2019 s biggest foe . After previously cosponsoring legislation with Jeff Sessions , Booker chose to testify against his confirmation to be attorney general , the first time in Senate history that a sitting senator testified against another sitting senator for a cabinet post during a confirmation . ( President Trump probably wishes he had listened to Booker \u2019 s objections . ) By 2018 , Booker insisted that supporters of Brett Kavanaugh were \u201c complicit in evil \u201d \u2014 and this was before the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford were revealed .\nAnd now , here Booker is , trying to out- # Resistance the rest of the Democratic field , who are all attempting to metamorphize into the ultimate anti-Trump , some sort of amalgamation of Rachel Maddow , Tom Steyer , Jimmy Kimmel , Jim Acosta , Jorge Ramos , and Stormy Daniels .
