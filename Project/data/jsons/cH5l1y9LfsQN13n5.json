Jones is currently the defendant in a precedent-setting lawsuit brought against him by the parents of a Sandy Hook victim .\nBut the ongoing conversation around the real-life damage Jones and his network have inflicted has also been accompanied by weeks of hedging from major internet companies , including Facebook and Spotify , about how to deal with Jones on their platforms while still protecting free speech .\nInitially , Facebook , YouTube , and Spotify all took selective action , banning some episodes of Jones \u2019 s podcasts and shows or removing selected social media posts they found to be in violation of various policies while allowing Infowars channels to remain active . Last Thursday , the popular audio streaming app Stitcher became the first platform to pull all of Jones \u2019 s content , without a lot of fuss .\nBut on Sunday night , Apple followed suit , summarily banning all of Jones \u2019 s content from iTunes \u2014 in the process sending a definitive message about what is and isn \u2019 t permissible free speech .

In response , Zuckerberg seemed to use the idea of protecting free speech to dance around the ethically blurry line of leaving his platform open to people who could spread harmful fake news and potentially dangerous views :\n\u201c The approach that we \u2019 ve taken to false news is not to say : You can \u2019 t say something wrong on the internet , \u201d Zuckerberg said . \u201c I think that that would be too extreme . Everyone gets things wrong , and if we were taking down people \u2019 s accounts when they got a few things wrong , then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that . \u201d\nFollowing this interview , however , backlash mounted over Zuckerberg \u2019 s comments , which included an attempt to explain why Facebook probably wouldn \u2019 t ban Holocaust denialism despite its repugnance . In response to criticism of what seemed to be Zuckerberg \u2019 s nebulous stance , Facebook temporarily suspended Jones himself \u2014 that is , his personal Facebook page \u2014 as well as four selected videos that the company deemed had violated its community standards .\nFacebook \u2019 s selectiveness seemed to guide the other sites that subsequently took steps toward placing restrictions on Infowars . Both Spotify and YouTube chose to allow Jones \u2019 s channels to remain active while removing only the specific episodes of his shows and podcasts that they said violated their content guidelines .\nStitcher and Apple , however , took a less wishy-washy approach . On Thursday night , Stitcher responded to an angry tweet about Jones \u2019 s presence on the platform with a note that it had removed his podcasts .\nThanks for your note . We have reviewed Alex Jones \u2019 podcasts and found he has , on multiple occasions , harassed or allowed harassment of private individuals and organizations , ( 1/2 ) \u2014 Stitcher ( @ Stitcher ) August 3 , 2018\nand that harassment has led listeners of the show to engage in similar harassment and other damaging activity . Therefore , we have decided to remove his podcasts from the Stitcher platform . ( 2/2 ) \u2014 Stitcher ( @ Stitcher ) August 3 , 2018\nAnd Stitcher didn \u2019 t have to wait long before another podcast platform joined with its position .

Early Monday morning , the platform unpublished four of Infowars \u2019 pages . \u201c The timing of Facebook \u2019 s announcement was unusual , with the company confirming the ban at 3am local time , \u201d the Guardian noted about Facebook \u2019 s early morning purge .\nFacebook \u2019 s official statement on the removal noted that since its initial ban of four Infowars videos in July , \u201c more content from the same Pages has been reported to us , \u201d which the company found \u201c violates our graphic violence policy , and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender , Muslims and immigrants , which violates our hate speech policies . \u201d\nYouTube was next to fall in line , banning Jones late Monday morning by removing all of his channels . In a statement , a YouTube spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c All users agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines when they sign up to use YouTube . When users violate these policies repeatedly , like our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures , we terminate their accounts . \u201d\nYouTube had previously warned Jones by applying a \u201c strike \u201d to his account for content violation , as well as suspending Jones \u2019 s live-streaming privileges ; however , Jones apparently continued to live-stream from his other channels despite the suspension \u2014 so YouTube ultimately saw fit to give him the boot .\nNow that the pressure is on , many people are calling for Twitter and other social platforms to take action against Jones next .
