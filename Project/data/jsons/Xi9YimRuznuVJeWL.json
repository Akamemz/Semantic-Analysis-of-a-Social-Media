At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus .

There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it \u2019 s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed \u2014 such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But\u2026 \u2018 even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. \u2019 \u2026\nOthers note that \u201c [ Warren ] has provided more detail on Medicare financing than Sanders has . She has also provided more overall policy detail , including on the taxes she would raise , than Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg . And her Medicare plan comes much , much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts . I wish the conservatives complaining about her plan applied the same rigor to their own ideas\u2026 The biggest weakness of Warren \u2019 s approach is that it tries to bulldoze through the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system . Warren would not let people opt into Medicare , a wildly popular idea . She would force them to join\u2026 she needs to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon. \u201d David Leonhardt , New York Times\nHarris \u2019 s plan is \u201c a great start , but it \u2019 s not enough . We need a voucher system for people who work late nights and early-morning shifts . Parents need real dollars and quality options they can choose from\u2026 An after-school care allowance would enable low-income families to find safe and beneficial environments for their kids until the workday finishes . A voucher system would be flexible enough to work across the gamut of potential after-school activities \u2014 allowing parents to pay for tutoring , arts , dance , karate , and so forth \u2014 instead of forcing kids \u2019 participation in only the activities provided by their particular school , as Harris \u2019 plan would obligate. \u201d Andre Perry , Medium\nSome argue that \u201c While Harris \u2019 s school-day extension program may not be the flippant neoliberal fluff that its most vociferous critics first suggested , it \u2019 s also far from a serious solution to the chronic overworking of both teachers and parents . The childcare deficit for working families sits at the intersection of frozen wages , longer workdays , and skyrocketing private childcare costs . And Harris \u2019 s plan and the reaction to it , if anything , offer an object lesson in why Band-Aid approaches to such a multi-factored problem won \u2019 t work \u2026 \u201c After-school programs already exist en masse for wealthy school systems with wealthy parents filling up wealthy PTAs . The idea of delivering a sense of equity to schools that service lower-income communities is full of potential . But that potential is undercut by its demand that the participating schools find a non-federal partner to match at least ten percent of the federal grant\u2026 Any proposal that relies on private funding is almost guaranteed to widen the gap between affluent and more cash-strapped communities. \u201d Nick Martin , The New Republic\n\u201c Harris \u2019 s plan is not only designed to provide child care , but to provide actual enrichment for kids \u2014 physical activity , reading , tutoring , and other beneficial activities that affluent parents can pay for through camps , private programs , babysitters , and tutors . This objective is also part of what rankles Harris \u2019 s critics [ on the left ] \u2026 [ One such critic attacks ] Harris for designing a program that assumes many parents will continue to put in eight-hour days , with some commuting time , instead of a socialist paradise where they clock out at 2:30 . \u2018 Rather than reshaping society to accommodate the needs of workers , \u2019 he writes . \u2018 Harris \u2019 s plan is designed to keep more people working for longer , suiting the interests of their employers \u2019 \u2026 \u201c The first part of that sentence \u2014 \u2018 Rather than reshaping society \u2026 \u2019 \u2014 is so perfect . Why would Harris try to give low-income students a better education when she could simply reshape society ? ... It \u2019 s certainly true that the left has long advocated a shorter working day and more vacation time . But even blue-sky left-wingers tend to settle on an eight-hour day as a standard , with vacation schedules still much shorter than what most schools use\u2026 To demand Harris address this entirely through workplace reforms is to demand she institute not only a maximum eight-hour day , but also end work for parents around 2:30 or so , plus a full day off every day school is out that isn \u2019 t a national holiday ( there are a lot of them ) , plus ten weeks or so over the summer. \u201d Jonathan Chait , New York Magazine\n\u201c The majority of schools days end around 3 p.m. , two hours before the end of 70 percent of parents \u2019 workdays . And most schools don \u2019 t have a way to make up the difference . Fewer than half of all elementary schools\u2014and fewer than a third of low-income schools\u2014offer after-school care . Beyond that misalignment , schools shut down , on average , for 29 days during the school year , the majority of which are reserved for professional development , parent-teacher conferences , and myriad vacations and minor holidays the federal government doesn \u2019 t recognize\u2026 \u201c That \u2019 s a full two weeks \u2019 worth of days more than what the average American has in holidays , vacation , and paid leave combined . And then , of course , there \u2019 s summer vacation , a two- to three-month break that leaves working parents scrambling for day-long care\u2026 The mismatch between the school day and work day presents a real burden to working Americans with families . \u201d Kara Voght , Mother Jones\nThe right is critical of the plan , arguing that the federal government is not an adequate substitute for families and local communities .\nThe right is critical of the plan , arguing that the federal government is not an adequate substitute for families and local communities .\n\u201c The first question here is whether we want federal taxpayers helping to engineer a deep change in the expected role of schools . Education is a local priority , and the non-educational functions of schools should especially be left to local control . If states and cities want to ensure that schools make child care available all year , they \u2019 re free to fund that with their own money rather than hitting up federal taxpayers\u2026\n\u201c The policy also puts the government \u2019 s thumb on the scale when it comes to parents \u2019 decision of whether to both work or have one parent stay home . One natural consequence of working parents is that kids need care from someone else , and the cost of that care should be factored into this decision . But Harris would have the public shoulder the cost instead . This also means that when parents do decide to have an adult stay home , they \u2019 ll still be stuck paying the extra taxes to fund everyone else \u2019 s child care\u2026 If we want to make life easier for parents , we can just give them money , rather than expanding the reach of schools into families \u2019 responsibilities and discouraging stay-at-home parenting . \u201d\n\u201c Harris \u2019 s program forgets that education doesn \u2019 t just happen at school . It happens in the home . A good education will provide more than book knowledge . It will also provide social interaction and , hopefully , character formation . These days , you \u2019 d be hard-pressed to find a public school equipped to offer all of the above . That \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important for children to spend time in their neighborhoods , with their friends and family . Locking children up in a school building all day will keep them from the community that will ultimately influence and shape them\u2026\n\u201c There are real problems facing U.S. families , but Harris \u2019 s program is another attempt to replace community with big government . Instead , communities should make this a priority , with the promotion of the family at the forefront . Cities such as Chapel Hill , North Carolina , have already begun to make progress , offering parents tax credits and scholarship programs to help pay for child care close to their homes . Reasonable steps like these relieve parents of undue stress without sacrificing the social and moral development of their children . \u201d\n\u201c I had a single working mother who rarely if ever was able to pick me up , or be available for extra events imposed by the school . I remember \u2018 the gap \u2019 quite well . It would have been strange for us even to think of using [ paid ] child care . The institutions of our world filled the gap : neighbors , friends , and family . I remember the phrase \u2018 it takes a village \u2019 made some sense to me at the time\u2026 I instinctively recoil at the idea of using schools for after-school work . My own childhood experience taught me a great deal of independence and responsibility . It gave me confidence to call on neighbors and friends for help . This is good practice for offering it back in the future . \u201d\n\u201c The candidates all have admirable aims with these proposals , like helping working parents , giving kids more education , and fostering volunteerism and social cohesion . But the result in practice is young people spending more time in controlled , institutional settings and less time with their families or on their own , building the skills of independence they need for adulthood . Children need to be let alone sometimes . These plans eat up what little freedom they have\u2026\n\u201c Kids ' free time is already shrinking , being consumed by longer hours of instruction , after-school care , and other scheduled activities . Unstructured recess time is on the decline , contrary to pediatricians ' recommendation , and where recess persists , it is often hedged into inactivity by onerous rules and heavy homework loads . And parents are increasingly subject to scrutiny , including from law enforcement , for statistically safe behavior that was considered perfectly normal a decade or two ago , like leaving a child in the car for five minutes while running into a store or letting them play at a park alone . Making the school day 10 hours long is a huge jump down this road whose destination we frankly do not know . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency .
