But there is certainly a metric that helps them gauge the amount .\nMost Republicans have gone along grudgingly with Trump -- if they support the presumptive presidential nominee at all . Some of those lawmakers are now reviewing that political quotient as they wonder what Trump might say next .\nThey ponder how many more times they \u2019 ll have to condemn Trump \u2019 s remarks . They ask themselves if they \u2019 ll again have to awkwardly criticize Trump \u2019 s comments about a judge or women or Muslims -- yet reaffirm allegiance to him in the next breath .\nOnly Trump knows what lies in his heart when it comes to race , ethnicity and religion . But some of his comments give people pause and perhaps make them think of the lyrics in the Avenue Q tune . No , Trump doesn \u2019 t \u201c go around committing hate crimes. \u201d But his comments certainly sound \u201c a little bit racist \u201d to some and \u201c a lotta bit racist \u201d to others .\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions , R-Texas , says he \u2019 ll vote for Trump . But he adds that Trump needs to alter his rhetoric . And if Trump keeps it up ?\n\u201c It causes a lot of us to think , \u201d Sessions responded .\nSenate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune , South Dakota , said Trump \u2019 s \u201c going to have to adapt . \u2026 This is not working for him . \u201d\nThis has been an unconventional election year because it flips political norms on their ear . But political capital still exists and isn \u2019 t unlimited .\nRepublicans can not repeatedly find themselves crossways with the top of their ticket , blasting Trump \u2019 s provocative language yet failing to disavow that person and their ideals . Political capital is fungible , and some of Republicans could see their own stock plunge if they are linked too closely to Trump .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to be sucked into talking about Trump 24/7 , \u201d protested Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn , R-Texas , when asked about the Trump \u2019 s views that federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel is incapable of fairly adjudicating a lawsuit involving Trump University because he is \u201c Mexican . \u201d\nNever mind that Curiel was born in Indiana to Hispanic parents .\nCornyn says Republicans should focus instead on policy and the issues . But try as they might , the GOP fights a powerful political news vacuum that insists on focusing on Trump and his missteps \u201c 24/7 . \u201d\nAt the Senate Republican leadership press conference Tuesday afternoon , just outside the Senate chamber , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke about plans to finish a defense bill this week ( which didn \u2019 t happen ) .\nThe leader mentioned opioid and energy measures . Cornyn then spoke about defense and North Korea . Thune cited the Iran nuclear deal and ISIS . Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wyoming , discussed the economy and job numbers .\nAnd then reporters ignored the leadership boilerplate and asked four consecutive questions about Trump .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to let you all try one more time , \u201d beseeched an exasperated McConnell to the press corps .\nNaturally , journalists fired a fifth sidewinder interrogative at McConnell about Trump \u2019 s invective \u201c overshadowing \u201d the GOP agenda and the ability of Congress to legislate .\n\u201c OK . I \u2019 m going to wrap it up with this , \u201d huffed McConnell , who turned his ire on Trump . \u201c It \u2019 s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message . He has an opportunity to do that . This election is eminently winnable . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re all anxious to hear what he might say next , \u201d said the Kentucky Republican .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , didn \u2019 t fare much better when he spoke Tuesday in inner-city Washington at an event rolling out the GOP \u2019 s anti-poverty plan .\nNaturally , the first question focused on Trump , forcing the speaker to characterize the remarks about Curiel as \u201c the textbook definition of a racist comment . \u201d\nOne Republican lawmaker hit the ceiling with Trump earlier in the week .\nSen. Mark Kirk , R-Ill. , faces perhaps the most-challenging re-election campaign of any GOP senator this fall .\nKirk this week dropped his support for Trump . He said the first-time candidate and billionaire businessman \u201c has not demonstrated the temperament necessary to be president . \u201d\nKirk also said he wouldn \u2019 t support Hillary Clinton for president . When asked who he might back , Kirk initially said \u201c no one \u201d before quickly adding he would \u201c write-in David Petraeus . \u201d\nTrump then published a statement that failed to extinguish the flames on the Curiel comments . Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , doesn \u2019 t support Trump . The new statement vexed the senator .\n\u201c This is a new level , \u201d Flake said . \u201c He needs to retract . \u201d\nA reporter asked Flake whether he thought Trump had sufficiently \u201c walked back \u201d the Curiel remarks .\n\u201c Keep walking , \u201d replied Flake , sounding like a pitchman for Johnnie Walker Blue Label .\nNot all congressional Republicans are able or willing to tell Trump to take a hike .\nRep.
