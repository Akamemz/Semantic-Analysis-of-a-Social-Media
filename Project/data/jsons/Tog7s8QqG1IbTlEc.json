Marco Rubio , after taking steps last week to coalesce the backing of the party \u2019 s upper echelons , saw his momentum halted in the state , which punished him for delivering an overly scripted debate performance .\nThe establishment picture is now more clouded than ever , with Rubio , Jeb Bush , and New Hampshire runner-up John Kasich heading for a brutal fight in South Carolina \u2013 a state known for its rough-and-tumble political culture . Chris Christie , who was also competing for establishment support , is reassessing his campaign \u2019 s future .\nAll of this , many in the mainstream wing of the GOP worry , is excellent news for one man : Donald Trump .\n\u201c This is the perfect storm for Trump , \u201d said Matt Dowd , who served as chief strategist on George W. Bush \u2019 s 2004 reelection campaign . \u201c He got his poll numbers , won by double digits , recovered from a loss , and has multiple opponents . You couldn \u2019 t design a better scenario for him . \u201d\nBy the time the party gets around to unifying around a mainstream contender , Dowd added , it \u2019 s possible Trump will have gained enough momentum to be unstoppable .\nIt will also complicate the efforts to halt Ted Cruz , who like Trump is running in the insurgent lane . After winning the Iowa caucuses , Cruz coasted to a third-place finish in New Hampshire . But he is well positioned in evangelical-rich South Carolina and a series of southern states that vote in March .\nAdding to the chaos is Kasich \u2019 s surprisingly strong showing , which empowered him to push forward . While the Ohio governor is unlikely to fare well in South Carolina , where he has little infrastructure , his advisers argue that he will be able to remain in the race for weeks on end and rack up delegates in Midwestern states like Michigan , where Kasich has begun establishing a strong organization . He is virtually certain to win Ohio , which holds its primary a week later , on March 15 , and awards its delegates on a winner-take-all basis .\nWhile Kasich remains a longshot to win the Republican nomination , his ongoing presence in the race will complicate the party \u2019 s hopes to unify the field .\n\u201c Kasich coming in second and the bunching up in low double digits of the mainstream candidates is a dream come true for Trump , \u201d said Ari Fleischer , who was press secretary in the George W.
