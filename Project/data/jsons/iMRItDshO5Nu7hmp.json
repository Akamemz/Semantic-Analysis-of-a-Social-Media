Here are some thoughts.\n\nKentucky was not an upset. Inside Elections changed its rating on the governor\u2019s race from Lean Republican to Toss-up in mid July after finding Gov. Matt Bevin very vulnerable. So those who were surprised by Democrat Andy Beshear\u2019s declared victory weren\u2019t paying close enough attention.\n\nTrump was an asset, not a liability. Without a last-minute push and visit from President Donald Trump, Bevin would have probably lost by a wider margin. The decision to urge Kentucky voters to see their ballots as sending a message to the nation as a whole was the right strategy for the governor and Republicans. It just wasn\u2019t enough to solve Bevin\u2019s problems.\n\nImpeachment isn\u2019t the silver bullet for Republicans. Complaining about the impeachment process might galvanize the GOP base, but Kentucky showed there\u2019s a limit, and Republicans can\u2019t rely on it as a cure-all.\n\nBevin clearly had a unique problem. Republicans won the five other statewide offices, four of them by more than a dozen points. Tuesday\u2019s results doesn\u2019t tell us much about how the state will vote in 2020, when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is up for reelection.\n\nTransformation of Virginia is complete. Just more than a dozen years ago, Virginia had two Republican U.S. senators. Now, Republicans are just trying to field a credible challenger against Sen. Mark Warner and Democrats have full control of the commonwealth at the state and federal level after winning majorities in the Legislature. A pretty remarkable political turnaround.\n\nSuburbs continue to be a problem for Republicans. Tuesday\u2019s results continued to demonstrate GOP problems in the suburbs since Trump took office. The latest was in northern Kentucky in the Cincinnati suburbs, where Bevin won in 2015 and Beshear won in 2019. Or in northern Mississippi, in the Memphis suburbs where the GOP margin in DeSoto County dropped from 61 points to 20 points, according to Ryan Matsumoto, a contributing analyst to Inside Elections. These are just the latest pieces of evidence after Democrat Dan McCready\u2019s overperformance in the Charlotte suburbs from 2018 to the 2019 special election in North Carolina\u2019s 9th District. It should be particularly concerning for President Trump in his efforts to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas in 2020.\n\nMississippi is a red state. State Attorney General Jim Hood was viewed as the strongest possible Democratic candidate. He lost by 5 points.\n\nNathan L. Gonzales is an elections analyst for CQ Roll Call.",
