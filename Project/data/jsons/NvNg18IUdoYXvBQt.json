'' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke to Netanyahu after the assault and denounced it as an `` act of pure terror and senseless brutality and violence . ''\nKerry blamed the attack on Palestinian calls for `` days of rage , '' and said Palestinian leaders must take serious steps to refrain from such incitement . He also urged Palestinian leaders to condemn the attack `` in the most powerful terms .

'' The statement called for an end to the `` invasion '' of the mosque at a contested holy site in the city and a halt to `` incitement '' by Israeli ministers .
