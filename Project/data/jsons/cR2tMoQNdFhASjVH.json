In doing so , Speaker Paul Ryan , House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have so far sidestepped the messy , charged fights that have come to split the Republican Party and typify the modern-day Congress .\nOn Thursday , the House will vote on a bill that is aimed at stepping up background checks before Syrian and Iraqi refugees are let into America \u2014 an idea first envisioned by Rep.

So , beginning Friday night and stretching into Saturday morning , McCarthy convened a series of calls with committee chairmen like Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul of Texas and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce of California . Hudson spoke to McCarthy about his bill , which McCarthy thought was a good start and deserved consideration . On Saturday , McCarthy called the new speaker and described what he was up to .\nAnd on Saturday night , McCarthy held another conference call to discuss the attack and Paris , and what U.S. policy should be going forward .\nWhen the House got into session Monday evening , McCarthy and his aides chatted with House Democratic leadership .

''\nThe unfolding crisis following the Paris terror attacks amounts to the first major test of the new relationship between Ryan and McConnell , who are carefully navigating public trepidation about whether the government \u2019 s resettlement program poses a safety threat .\nMcConnell added that he and Ryan were talking to the White House about any legislation Obama may be open to -- adding to the layers of coordination .\nOf course , this could all blow up .
