( Feb. 15 ) AP\nOROVILLE , Calif. \u2014 Eldon Hofeling raises his voice over the roar of backhoes , helicopters , tumbling rocks , dump trucks and 750,000 gallons of water rushing past every second .\nSteps away from his house , hundreds of contractors are struggling to repair the Oroville Dam before the spring rains arrive in earnest . A stream of semi-trailers unloads chunks of rocks , which backhoes then load onto large dump trucks to deliver to weak spots on the other side of the dam . Helicopters chatter overhead every 90 seconds , lifting in even more rocks to shore up the dam \u2019 s top . Diesel engines rumble day and night , contractors bark orders and neighbors wander by to take a look .\nEvery bedroom window in Hofeling 's house looks out over the dam , at what is now a staging area . Contractors told him this repair effort could last weeks .\nThe mere threat of a dam failure last week was enough to temporarily evacuate about 200,000 people living downstream . And a collapse could cause death and devastation in both the short- and long-term : This reservoir stores water to irrigate downstream farms and provide drinking water for Los Angeles .\nResidents here in Oroville , Marysville and Yuba City are now living with the fresh knowledge that maybe this dam isn \u2019 t as safe as they thought . That fact that the water benefits people hundreds of miles away from this danger is reverberating around these conservative communities that see little common ground with the far more liberal Californians on the coast and in Silicon Valley .\nThis isn \u2019 t just idle talk : One of the first signs heading into Oroville , population 16,000 , urges residents to support seceding from California to create a new state of Jefferson . Here in inland California , Gov . Jerry Brown \u2019 s name evokes disgust , and President Donald Trump is seen as the one who really cares . Here , residents distrust a state government they think is all-too-eager to help undocumented immigrants and build a bullet train to serve the rich coastal elites , leaving them with little .\n\u201c I bet that if they put this effort into building it right the first time , they wouldn \u2019 t have to do all of this , \u201d Hofeling , 66 , says as a backhoe drops rocks into a dump truck , shaking the ground .\nIt \u2019 s a refrain voiced time and again in Oroville and the surrounding towns : The liberal , more populated parts of California suck up all the political attention and public dollars , leaving little for the men and women who help grow the nation \u2019 s food , fruits and nuts . That dichotomy has bred a mistrust of state government and a healthy skepticism of federal officials , Trump excepted .\nHow is it , the people here ask , that state and federal officials didn \u2019 t seem to have the money to properly fix the dam \u2019 s problems when they were first identified , but have seemingly untold millions available when the crisis finally arrived .\nTo understand the situation , you have to look more carefully at California \u2019 s voting tallies . Statewide , Hillary Clinton clobbered Trump , winning 61 % of the popular vote and 4.2 million more votes than Trump . On one hand , this is a state that utterly rejected Trump . On the other hand , because California is so big , there \u2019 s wide variation in political affiliations .\nThe farmers and ranchers of Butte County , surrounding Oroville , live vastly different lives than the millionaires strolling Santa Monica \u2019 s beaches or riding the Google buses to Mountain View or the Facebook coaches to Menlo Park . Butte County favored Trump in the election 46 % to 42 % , despite the presence of the more urban and traditionally more liberal Chico within its boundaries . Downstream neighbor Yuba County , home of Yuba City and Marysville , is perhaps a more accurate barometer : It went for Trump at nearly 58 % .\nIn this part of the state , Brown is the bad guy for picking fights with the president over immigration , climate change and national priorities . Trump , in turn , called California \u201c out of control \u201d and suggested he might try to withhold federal funding , particularly over whether the more liberal coastal cities were acting as sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants .\n\u201c As you know , I \u2019 m very much opposed to sanctuary cities .
