    "content": "On Rainey Street , one of Austin \u2019 s premier party districts , Little Brother Bar propped up a sign just before the city \u2019 s famed South by Southwest festival was canceled . It read : \u201c Went to SXSW & all I got was this coronavirus . \u201d\nLike so many other small businesses \u2014 and they don \u2019 t come much tinier than Little Brother , with room for just eight customers \u2014 the spread of the virus knocked a hole in its bottom line .\nEric Silverstein , the owner of Austin \u2019 s Peached Tortilla , was glum about the impact of the virus on his catering business . And Rebecca Charles , who tends bar for special events , put a plaintive post on Facebook . She was \u201c out so much money that I don \u2019 t even want to say it. \u201d Because she doesn \u2019 t work at a regular bar , \u201c without the events , we have no work . \u201d\nThe spread of the virus has rocked industries from airlines and cruises to Apple and Applebee \u2019 s . The only economic question now is how deep the damage to the economy will go . And the big political question is whether the virus will do to President Donald Trump what the Ukraine and Russian investigations did not : erode his impregnable base . Could this be his Hurricane Katrina moment , multiplied a thousand times over ?\nThat \u2019 s why the plight of Silverstein , Charles and so many other small-business people throughout the country is so important . If it were up to operators of small businesses , the Guardian reported , Trump would easily win reelection . A poll just last month found that Trump enjoyed an approval rating of 64 % among members of the group , as high as it had been since his election . Almost two-thirds of those responding expected higher revenue in 2020 .\nBut that was before the virus sent stock prices plummeting and consumer anxiety sky-high . It was also before the virus set the table for a quick push for so many of the social welfare issues that the Democrats had championed for years , from family and medical leave to health care for the uninsured . The question is which way small-business owners and gig-economy workers will go .\nIt \u2019 s one thing for big companies like Amazon , Facebook , Microsoft and Google to ask their employees to work from home . But for many owners of small businesses and their employees , that isn \u2019 t an option . It just doesn \u2019 t work to run a bar from home .\nEmployers with fewer than 20 workers make up 89 % of all businesses in the country . Firms with fewer than 500 employees account for almost half of all payrolls . In one analysis , gig economy workers who have struck out on their own now are one of every six employees , though estimates range from 10 % to a third of the workforce . The Trump administration has quietly been cultivating those who employ these workers . That strategy now finds itself at a crossroads : will the administration provide aid to these companies and programs for their workers ?\nOpinion : Here \u2019 s how Congress should respond today to the COVID-19 recession\nTrump \u2019 s base has proven bulletproof to everything that \u2019 s come his way . But this time it could be different , for two reasons . First , it \u2019 s one thing to call the Ukraine inquiry a hoax or complain that the Democrats are marketing fake news or tweet that \u201c Nothing is shut down , life & the economy go on. \u201d It \u2019 s quite another when the kids \u2019 school is closed , the Purell disappears off the shelves , and grandma \u2019 s nursing home sends out special bulletins .\nIt \u2019 s impossible for Trump to tweet his way out of that . There are millions of Americans directly affected\u2014and millions of jobs at risk in an economy where some people can \u2019 t work in front of a computer screen . The pressures for help will be overpowering .\n\u201c This sets up the battle that could well define Trump \u2019 s chances for a second term . \u201d\nSecond , the virus anxiety is quietly stoking the Democrats \u2019 campaign for programs they want to expand . It \u2019 s one thing to tell the kids to stay home from school , but another to ask who will take care of them when parents don \u2019 t have family and medical leave . It \u2019 s one thing to promise virus tests for everyone , but another to ask who has the insurance to pay for testing and for follow-up care if the test comes back positive . It \u2019 s one thing to pledge protection for pre-existing conditions , but it \u2019 s another when those pre-existing conditions make some parts of the population more vulnerable to the flu .\nPresident Trump is pledging help for small businesses and paid leave for employees who can \u2019 t skip work . But if he gives it during the crisis , how can he take it away when it \u2019 s over ? And once he gives in on programs the Democrats have clamored for in recent elections , how can he avoid feeding their campaign against him ?\nThe answer could be that Trump could make a quick pivot by pulling the electoral rug out from under the Democrats . He could proclaim himself the champion of small-business owners\u2014and the millions of Americans who work for them and in the new gig economy\u2014and steal the Democrats \u2019 issues away from them . This could even trump his \u201c repeal and replace \u201d pledge for Obamacare .\nRead : Don \u2019 t discount the support for Bernie Sanders in Trump country\nThat would require Trump to convince queasy Republicans and some of his own aides to embrace big-government ideas they had long resisted .
