The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed . Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting , leaky pipes and decades-old plans that\u2014 if not corrected and replaced\u2014 will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities .\nThe disaster in Flint , which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit \u2019 s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure , is likely brewing in many other communities . It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet , we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead . And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community . That level of negligence is beyond comprehension .\nThe dangerous , detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented . In 1978 , a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law , after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning . When it comes to levels of lead in water , no true amount is safe . However , in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter , and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levels .\nThese laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound . A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels , while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vapors .\nOnce lead enters the human body , the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys . It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases . However , the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain , especially in young or unborn children .
