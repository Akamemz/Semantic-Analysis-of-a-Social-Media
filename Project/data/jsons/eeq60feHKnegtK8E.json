Well , you might say that you are planning to go to war with Iran because of its advancing nuclear program .

But this is basically the position of the Obama administration , which has said it will not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons and has imposed such onerous sanctions on the country that the Iranian currency has plunged in value as much as 80 % against the dollar since the beginning of the year .\nOn Afghanistan , Romney said he will work to transition from U.S. combat troops to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014 , which is -- the Obama administration 's policy .\nRomney said he would not make a `` politically timed retreat '' from Afghanistan , a somewhat mystifying construction , since this year Obama negotiated a well-publicized Strategic Partnership Agreement with the Afghan government that will keep an as-yet-unspecified number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan in an advisory and counterterrorism role until 2024 . That is something that Romney did n't mention in his Monday speech and hardly suggests a precipitous Obama-led retreat from Afghanistan , which is already America 's longest war .\nFamously , Romney did n't mention that longest war in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in August , so his new embrace of the Afghan War seems a tad belated .\nRomney 's Monday speech underlined the fact that there is more agreement than disagreement between mainstream Democrats and mainstream Republicans on foreign policy issues .\nTo create the illusion that there are genuine substantive policy differences , Romney enlisted the issue of trade , saying on Monday that he would `` champion free trade . ...
