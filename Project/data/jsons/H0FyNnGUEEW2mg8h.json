    "content": "Last night , President Donald J. Trump selected Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals to be our next associate justice for the Supreme Court . He \u2019 ll be filling the vacancy left by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy . It was a highly anticipated decision . The composition of the Court will lead decidedly towards the right if Kavanaugh is confirmed . Hearings are scheduled for the summer , with final vote in early October\u2014just in time for the midterms .\nYet , even before the announcement was made , the Left was going berserk . They had a full-blown meltdown when Kennedy announced his retirement shortly after the official end of the 2017 term . The news broke a little after Janus v. AFSCME was decided , dealing a blow to public sector unions squeezing non-union members for dues . It \u2019 s now an unconstitutional practice to force non-members to pony up money for activities they don \u2019 t support\u2014and labor unions do a lot of that . The chances of an aftershock post-SCOTUS announcement were high , and it \u2019 s still not over . We should expect more insanity today and for most of the week .\nStill , last night saw some very popcorn-worthy drama from the Left . Even before he was selected , the media was characterizing the pick as \u201c controversial. \u201d MSNBC spent a segment discussing ways in which liberals can derail this nomination . The Handmaid \u2019 s Tale , which no one watches , is now a reality\u2026in the minds of the unhinged progressive Left . Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) said he \u2019 s going to fight Kavanaugh with everything he \u2019 s got , which isn \u2019 t much to begin with . He \u2019 s going to repeal Roe v. Wade , which is liberals \u2019 only concern . He \u2019 s anti-worker . And he \u2019 s also a pro-gun extremist\u2014whatever that means . Oh , yeah , he \u2019 s white ; that \u2019 s problematic . Great Odin \u2019 s raven , people !\nFirst , and I \u2019 m whipping out my person of color card here , how do I put this delicately : I don \u2019 t give a crap . Shoot me , but I grew up under the principle of the best person for the job should get the position . With this job , it \u2019 s that , plus experience and impeccable legal credentials , all of which Kavanaugh has and then some . So , it was the usual suspects that went apoplectic last night : former Clinton operatives , the AFL-CIO , NARAL , Center for American Progress , Democrats , anti-gun activists , pro-abortion activists , billionaires who want to impeach Donald Trump , and identity politics adherents . In other words , it was a literal parade of horribles .\nFox News host Shannon Bream was planning to broadcast her show live at SCOTUS last night , but protests organized by NARAL outside of the building created an unsafe atmosphere . She hosted her program inside the safety of the Fox News studios .\nElections have consequences , liberal journalists , writers , and politicians ; and you guys lost . Deal with it . And yes , this could be a bloody fight . This could be a long summer of every dirty trick in the books being used to stop this nominee , or it very well could be a pushover . Democrats don \u2019 t have much to work with other than hope that Sen. Susan Collins ( R-ME ) and maybe Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-AK ) defect . We \u2019 ll see what happens . More meltdown coverage will come shortly I \u2019 m sure . In the meantime , enjoy the compilation below .
