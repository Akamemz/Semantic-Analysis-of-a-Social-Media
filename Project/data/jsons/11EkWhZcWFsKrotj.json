Rating teachers not as easy as 1 , 2 , 3\nThe idea seems simple enough : Identify the best teachers and reward them . Pinpoint the worst and fire them .\nThat \u2019 s been a linchpin of the Obama administration \u2019 s education agenda from the start .\nBut now the administration \u2019 s initiative is in disarray , with states scaling back , slowing down and , in some cases , putting off tough decisions until Obama is out of office .\nTeachers union pressure , error-riddled evaluations and a wave of more difficult tests for students have won many teachers a reprieve from the newfangled evaluations during the school year now getting underway .\nTeachers have filed suit in a half-dozen states to block complicated new evaluation formulas that in some cases have rated them based on the test scores of students they never taught . Parents have protested that their children have been required to take tests created for the sole purpose of evaluating teachers . One county in Florida is developing 724 new final exams \u2014 in classes like welding and P.E .\nAnd after spending millions to develop modern evaluation systems , many states find they \u2019 re not identifying all that many bad teachers . In Rhode Island , 95 percent of teachers were rated effective or highly effective last year . In Florida and Indiana , it was 97 percent . In Tennessee and Michigan , 98 percent .\n\u201c It would be nice if we could have some kind of objective external measure to say , \u2018 This is what constitutes good teaching \u2014 or good enough teaching. \u2019 But the fact is , there \u2019 s no way the statistical measures can do that , \u201d said Brian Gill , a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research who works on so-called value-added calculations .\nFaced with these challenges , the administration has relaxed its aggressive timetables for states to begin evaluating all teachers based on objective measures of student learning , such as standardized test scores . In August , the Obama administration said states could ask for a delay in tying student test scores on new , more rigorous exams to teacher evaluations \u2014 though some states don \u2019 t need it . Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he expects some states will want to delay until the 2015-16 school year , but states can ask for a longer extension . If granted , their work could bleed into 2017 \u2014 and into the start of a new presidential administration .\nWashington , D.C. \u2014 one of the first districts to incorporate student test scores in teacher evaluations \u2014 isn \u2019 t using those scores to rate teachers next year . It \u2019 s hitting pause to give everyone a chance to get used to new exams linked to the Common Core academic standards . Maryland , New Jersey and Texas are all taking extra time to incorporate student test scores . Washington state legislators have flat-out refused to accept the administration \u2019 s vision of an acceptable evaluation system . And New Mexico is adjusting its system after flawed evaluations , based on erroneous data , caused an uproar in districts statewide . Teachers burned their evaluations in protest after receiving evaluations they believed were flawed .\nThe tinkering and pauses shouldn \u2019 t be a surprise , because implementation is difficult , said Sandi Jacobs , vice president and managing director of state policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality .\n\u201c If my boss told me that we would have a new performance system starting tomorrow , I would lose a night \u2019 s sleep , \u201d she said .\nAdvocates on all sides of education policy debates \u2014 including teachers unions \u2014 agree the old system of evaluating educators was broken .\nEvaluations were often infrequent and superficial . The principal might walk into a classroom , check a few things off a checklist and make sure the classroom was under control .\nIn 2009 , TNTP \u2014 formerly The New Teacher Project \u2014 came out with a report that found teachers were being treated as interchangeable parts or \u201c widgets , \u201d not professionals . Almost all teachers were rated as good or great \u2014 fewer than 1 percent were rated unsatisfactory . Meaningful feedback on how to improve was rare .\nSome states got to talking about reform .
