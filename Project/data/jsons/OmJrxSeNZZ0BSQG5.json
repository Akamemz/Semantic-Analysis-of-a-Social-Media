    "content": "The shooting in San Bernardino , California , on Wednesday was the 353rd mass shooting of 2015 , according to the crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker that \u2588\u2588\u2588 uses for our maps documenting mass shootings . Or it was the 29th , if you use data from USA Today . Or it was the fourth , if you use a database maintained by Mother Jones .\nHow are three news outlets coming up with such different answers ? It all comes down to definitions :\nThe Mass Shooting Tracker defines a mass shooting as an event in which four or more people were shot .\nUSA Today tracks mass killings , in which four or more people were killed .\n, in which . Mother Jones tracks mass killings in which four or more people were killed but excludes `` gang activity , armed robbery , or domestic violence . ''\nThere are other differences too \u2014 for example , Mother Jones says it generally only includes single gunman incidents , though it includes San Bernardino and the Columbine massacre in its database . But those are the main ones .\nWhat 's happening here a dispute not about the facts , but over what the appropriate definition is .\nThe Mass Shooting Tracker definition is fairly new , but the dispute between Mother Jones and USA Today is older and more ideologically fraught . That 's because the Mother Jones definition suggests that mass shootings are rising in number , and the USA Today definition does n't .\nIf you look at all killings in which four or more people died , there does n't appear to be a strong upward trend , according to estimates by Northeastern University criminology professor James Alan Fox , who uses a similar definition to USA Today :\nBut other researchers , like Amy P. Cohen , Deborah Azrael , and Matthew Miller of the Harvard School of Public Health , argue that Mother Jones 's more restrictive definition is appropriate . Cohen et al . analyzed Mother Jones 's data and concluded that mass shootings were becoming more frequent . They measure the average period of time between mass shooting incidents , rather than the number of incidents themselves ; mass shootings of the kind they 're studying are rare enough to make the latter untenable . They find that the period of time separating mass shootings ( by their definition ) has been shrinking :\nSo who 's right ? Well , Fox is right about the phenomenon he 's studying , Cohen et al . are right about the phenomenon they 're studying , and the Mass Shooting Tracker is right for the phenomenon it 's studying . Declaring one or the other definition the `` right '' one is too pat ; each is right for the thing it tracks . Fox 's data tells us that shootings of four or more people did n't decline in the 1990s the way shootings as a whole did ; that 's concerning . Cohen et al . 's data tells us that high-profile public mass shootings like Aurora or Newtown have not only failed to decline the way normal shootings have but have increased in recent years ; that 's also concerning . And the Mass Shooting tracker tells us that mass shootings , deadly or not , are a daily occurrence in the US ; that is , obviously , concerning .\nBut people still care about determining the `` right '' definition in cases like this for the purpose of ideological proxy warfare . Declaring Fox or Cohen et al . right , in particular , has a certain political valence in the wider gun control debate . You see something similar in discussions around school shootings , wherein gun control skeptics are as eager to declare that gang-related shootings in school are not real school shootings as they are to embrace Fox 's definition in which gang-related mass shootings are real mass shootings \u2014 and vice versa for gun control supporters .\nThe best case for gun control has little to do with mass shootings , and is n't necessarily focused on homicides at all\nWhat 's frustrating about this is that whether mass shootings are increasing or decreasing in frequency has very little to do with the generalized case for gun control . Mother Jones 's Mark Follman \u2014 who has done extraordinary work on gun violence in America , including compiling the data set used by Cohen et al . \u2014 is not wrong when he writes that the Mother Jones\u2013defined mass shootings are `` a unique phenomenon that must be understood on its own . '' And it 's worth studying both the phenomena identified by Fox and those identified by Mother Jones to find specialized ways to prevent them .\nBut mass shootings are very rare .
