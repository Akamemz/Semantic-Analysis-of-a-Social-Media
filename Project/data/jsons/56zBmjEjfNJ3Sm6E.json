Kennedy and Richard Nixon first met in Chicago , no other single moment has been more important in affecting the outcome of our elections . For good or ill , television \u2019 s laser-like eye reveals the candidates \u2019 fitness for the presidency\u2014their knowledge of domestic and foreign policy , their ability to answer reporters \u2019 probing questions , their coolness under fire , the image they project\u2014all tell voters which person should occupy the Oval Office .\nHistory tells us so . Vice President Richard Nixon entered a Chicago television studio on Sept. 26 , 1960 , confident that he could defeat Sen. Kennedy . After all , he had proven himself a master of television , which was already showing its great ability to affect American politics .\nWhen he was a candidate for vice president in 1952 , television had saved his career when a potential scandal\u2014the existence of a private fund created by businessmen to defray his travel and other expenses\u2014threatened his place on the Republican ticket . Party officials wanted him to leave and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower was leaning in that direction when Nixon decided to take his fate in his own hands . The result was the famous \u201c Checkers Speech \u201d when Nixon , with adoring wife Pat looking on bravely , shrewdly crafted a narrative every American could believe and take pride in . He was everyman : veteran of the Pacific war ( \u201c I was just there when the bombs were falling \u201d ) ; devoted husband ( \u201c Pat doesn \u2019 t have a mink coat\u2026 but I tell her she looks good in anything \u201d ) ; father of two darling daughters ; public servant barely getting by on his government salary . And borrowing a tactic from FDR , he made his dog Checkers the most famous cocker spaniel in America . In closing , he urged Republicans to write or wire their national committee about whether he should stay or go .\nThe response was overwhelmingly positive and Nixon , at 39 , eventually became the second youngest vice president in history . So he had nothing to fear about debating John F. Kennedy . Unfortunately , he was not at his best that September night . Campaigning in North Carolina earlier , he had banged his knee on a car door , ignored the continuing discomfort and wound up in Walter Reed Hospital with an infection that took him from the campaign for several weeks . After recovering , he rushed to catch up , caught a cold , which he ignored , and entered the television studio underweight , pale , and feverish . He looked terrible , especially when contrasted with Sen. Kennedy , who was tanned and rested . Immediately , his advantage as the experienced vice president disappeared , replaced by a man obviously nervous , perspiring , seemingly unready for the presidency .\nNarrowly defeated by Kennedy , Nixon learned from his mistakes . As the Republican presidential nominee in 1968 , Nixon chose not to debate his Democratic opponent , Vice President Hubert Humphrey . Instead , under the tutelage of media guru Roger Ailes , he used television brilliantly , appearing in a series of campaign appearance dubbed \u201c the man in the arena , \u201d in which Nixon answered softball questions from friendly audiences . He won . Four years later , running for re-election , he rejected Sen. George McGovern \u2019 s call for a debate and never again subjected himself to that kind of format .\nTaking office when Nixon resigned , Gerald Ford\u2014the first unelected vice president to succeed to the presidency\u2014could not avoid a debate in the post-Watergate America of 1976 . It proved to be his undoing . Stung by his pardon of Richard Nixon and faced with rising inflation and a weak economy , Ford stumbled badly during his second debate with Gov . Jimmy Carter . Discussing Soviet-American relations , he remarked that Russia did not dominate Eastern Europe and never would \u201c under a Ford administration. \u201d Immediately recognizing Ford \u2019 s gaffe , Carter , grinning like the Cheshire cat , said that the president \u2019 s statement would surprise Polish and Czech Americans whose relatives lived behind the Iron Curtain . In the days that followed , Ford tried to clarify his remarks but the damage was done . Carter was on his way to the White House .\nAnd so it went in succeeding elections\u2014whoever won the debate won the presidency . Political junkies will recall those moments . The year 1988 : Michael Dukakis \u2019 s tepid response when asked if he would \u201c favor an irrevocable death penalty \u201d for a man who had brutally raped and murdered his wife , Kitty . \u201c No , I don \u2019 t , Bernard , \u201d he replied softly to CNN \u2019 s Bernard Shaw . \u201c And I think you know that I \u2019 ve opposed the death penalty during all my life. \u201d The journalist Roger Simon later recalled the reactions of his colleagues in the press room : \u201c He \u2019 s through. \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s all she wrote. \u201d \u201c Get the hook. \u201d They were right : Dukakis , now appearing to be a bloodless technocrat , lost to George H.W . Bush .\nIn 1992 it was Bush \u2019 s turn to stumble . Debating Bill Clinton and Ross Perot , Bush seemed indifferent to a questioner from the audience who had been harmed by the recession . The cameras caught him looking at his watch ( he later admitted thinking , \u201c only 10 more minutes of this crap \u201d ) . Clinton immediately sensed an opportunity and moved closer to the woman , seeking more information about how she was faring in hard times . Clinton \u2019 s empathy won the night and the presidency .\nBut it \u2019 s the 1980 campaign that bears the closest resemblance to today \u2019 s Clinton-Trump contest . President Jimmy Carter , badly weakened by economic woes and his failure to win the release of the American hostages held captive by the Iranians for almost a year , faced Gov . Ronald Reagan , whom many thought too conservative and hawkish to become president . Carter went further : imitating LBJ \u2019 s attacks on his 1964 opponent Barry Goldwater , he painted Reagan as reckless and dangerous , his anti-Russian mania a threat to national security : \u201c Reagan will lead us into war , \u201d Carter claimed as the campaign drew to a close . Carter \u2019 s vitriolic rhetoric created another problem for the beleaguered president : The press began to attack him as an extremist , the embodiment of \u201c meanness . \u201d\nThe turning point came during Carter and Reagan \u2019 s debate in Cleveland , Ohio , on October 28 , 1980 . As the two men went to their podiums , Carter aide Vernon Jordan became immediately alarmed . \u201c I didn \u2019 t like what I saw , \u201d Jordan later recalled . \u201c Reagan looked relaxed , smiling , robust ; the President , erect , lips tight , looking like a coiled spring\u2026 an over-trained boxer , too ready for the bout. \u201d Each time Carter hurled a verbal barb , Reagan chuckled , and with a gentle toss of the head , remarked , \u201c There you go again. \u201d Reagan \u2019 s affability did not fit the image Carter had tried to create .\nLater , Carter complained that Reagan , the former B-movie actor , had \u201c memorized \u201d his best \u201c lines , and he pushes a button and they come out. \u201d He was confident that \u201c the issues are more important than the performance. \u201d He was wrong , as the Reagan landslide shortly proved .\nIf the history of presidential debates proves anything , it is that performance trumps issues . Time and again , Americans have elected the person who demonstrates not just intelligence but strength , stability , and some indefinable quality\u2014empathy , perhaps , or simple humanity .\nHillary Clinton faces a unique challenge when she faces Donald Trump . He is sui generis , one of kind , unlike anyone else who has ever sought the presidency . He has no programs she can attack , only proclamations\u2014a wall will be built , law and order will return , new jobs will appear , terrorism will be defeated\u2014all will be achieved , as if by magic , after he takes the presidential oath . So far , that strategy has succeeded , at least in some Republican circles .\nWill attacking such fiats as empty promises offered by an unqualified , even dangerous , opponent create sympathy for Trump as Carter \u2019 s attacks did for Reagan in 1980 ? Only if Trump borrows a page from the Reagan playbook and shrugs them off with a smile . But is he likely to do that ? His behavior during the Republican debates suggests that he won \u2019 t because he is incapable of dealing quietly with anyone who strikes at the Trump brand . Vanity is his Achilles \u2019 heel . Insulting his opponents is his style\u2014 \u201c Little Marco , \u201d \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted , \u201d \u201c Listless Jeb , \u201d \u201c Crooked Hillary . \u201d\nIt is thought that Trump \u2019 s unpredictability puts Clinton at a disadvantage . How does one prepare to face a man who has broken all the rules of American politics ? In fact , however , Trump is very predictable . He has only one response\u2014to insult . It is Hillary who should imitate Reagan , laugh at Trump \u2019 s attacks , and insist that her programs , not Trump \u2019 s empty promises , can improve the lives of Americans .\nOf course , there is the possibility that there will be no debates this year . Late on Friday night , July 29 , Trump tweeted , \u201c As usual , Hillary and the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games . Same as last time w/Bernie .
