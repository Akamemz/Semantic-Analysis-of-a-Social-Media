    "content": "All 50 states have moved to reopen their economies , at least partially , after shutting down businesses and gatherings in response to the coronavirus pandemic .\nBut a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis suggests that most states haven \u2019 t made the preparations needed to contain future waves of the pandemic \u2014 putting themselves at risk for a rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths should they continue to reopen , which some states have already seen .\nExperts told me states need three things to be ready to reopen . State leaders , from the governor to the legislature to health departments , need to ensure the SARS-CoV-2 virus is no longer spreading unabated . They need the testing capacity to track and isolate the sick and their contacts . And they need the hospital capacity to handle a potential surge in Covid-19 cases .\nMore specifically , states should meet at least five basic criteria . They should see a two-week drop in coronavirus cases , indicating that the virus is actually abating . They should have fewer than four daily new cases per 100,000 people per day \u2014 to show that cases aren \u2019 t just dropping , but also below dangerous levels . They need at least 150 new tests per 100,000 people per day , letting them quickly track and contain outbreaks . They need an overall positive rate for tests below 5 percent \u2014 another critical indicator for testing capacity . And states should have at least 40 percent of their ICU beds free to actually treat an influx of people stricken with Covid-19 should it be necessary .\nThese metrics line up with a range of expert recommendations , as well as the various policy plans put out by both independent groups and government officials to deal with the coronavirus .\nMeeting these metrics doesn \u2019 t mean that a state is ready to reopen its economy \u2014 a process that describes a wide range of local and state actions . And failing them doesn \u2019 t mean a state is in immediate danger of a coronavirus outbreak if it starts to reopen ; with Covid-19 , there \u2019 s always an element of luck and other factors .\nBut with these metrics , states can gauge if they have repressed the coronavirus while building the capacity to contain future outbreaks should they come . In other words , the benchmarks show how ready states are for the next phase of the fight .\nSo far , most states are not there . As of July 1 , just two states \u2014 New York and Rhode Island \u2014 met four or five of the goals , which demonstrates strong progress . Twenty-one states and Washington , DC , hit two or three of the benchmarks . The other 27 achieved zero or one .\nEven the states that have made the most progress aren \u2019 t necessarily ready to fully reopen . Without a vaccine or similar treatment , the threat of coronavirus is still out there . Especially in states that suffered big outbreaks , such as New York , even a lot of progress doesn \u2019 t mean all the underlying problems that led to an epidemic are gone .\nNor do the metrics cover everything that states should do before they can safely reopen . They don \u2019 t show , for example , if states have the capacity to do contact tracing , in which people who came into contact with someone who \u2019 s sick with Covid-19 are tracked down by \u201c disease detectives \u201d and quarantined . Contact tracing is key to containing an epidemic , but states don \u2019 t track how many contact tracers they \u2019 ve hired in a standardized , readily available way .\nStates also don \u2019 t have ready data for health care workers \u2019 access to personal protective equipment , such as masks and gloves \u2014 a critical measure of the health care system \u2019 s readiness that \u2019 s difficult to track .\nBut the map gives an idea of how much progress states have made toward containing the coronavirus and keeping it contained .\nStates will have to follow these kinds of metrics as they reopen . If the numbers \u2014 especially coronavirus cases \u2014 go in the wrong direction again , experts said governments should be ready to bring back restrictions . If states move too quickly to reopen or respond too slowly to a turn for the worse , they could see a renewed surge in Covid-19 cases .\n\u201c Planning for reclosing is part of planning for reopening , \u201d Mark McClellan , a health policy expert at Duke , told me . \u201c There will be outbreaks , and there will be needs for pauses and going back \u2014 hopefully not too much if we do this carefully . \u201d\nSo this will be a work in progress , at least until we get a Covid-19 vaccine or the pandemic otherwise ends , whether by natural or human means . But the metrics can at least help give states an idea of how far along they are in finally starting to open back up .\nWhat \u2019 s the goal ? A 10 percent drop in daily new coronavirus cases compared to two weeks ago and a 5 percent drop in cases compared to one week ago , based on data from the New York Times .\nWhich states meet the goal ? Massachusetts and Rhode Island \u2014 just two states . Washington , DC , did as well .\nWhy is this important ? Guidance from the White House and several independent groups emphasize that states need to see coronavirus cases drop consistently over two weeks before they can say they \u2019 re ready to begin reopening . After all , nothing shows you \u2019 re out of an outbreak like a sustained reduction in infections .\n\u201c The first and foremost [ metric ] is you want to have a continued decrease in cases , \u201d Saskia Popescu , an infectious disease epidemiologist , told me . \u201c It \u2019 s a huge piece . \u201d\nA simple reduction in cases compared to two weeks prior isn \u2019 t enough ; it has to be a significant drop , and it has to be sustained over the two weeks . So for \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s map , states need at least a 10 percent drop in daily new cases compared to two weeks prior and at least a 5 percent drop compared to one week prior .\nReported cases can be a reflection of testing capacity : More testing will pick up more cases , and less testing will pick up fewer . So it \u2019 s important that the decrease occur while testing is either growing or already sufficient . And since states have recently boosted their testing abilities , increases in Covid-19 cases can also reflect improvements in testing .\nEven after meeting this benchmark , continued caution is warranted . If a state meets the goal of a reduction in cases compared to one and two weeks ago but cases seemed to go up in recent days , then perhaps it \u2019 s not time to reopen just yet . \u201c You have to use common sense , \u201d Cyrus Shahpar , a director at the public health policy group Resolve to Save Lives , told me .\nGoal 2 : A low number of daily new Covid-19 cases\nWhat \u2019 s the goal ? Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day , based on data from the New York Times and Census Bureau .\nWhich states meet the goal ? Connecticut , Hawaii , Maine , Massachusetts , Michigan , Montana , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and West Virginia \u2014 11 states .\nWhy is this important ? One of the best ways to know you \u2019 re getting away from a disease outbreak is to no longer see a high number of daily new infections . While there \u2019 s no universally accepted number , experts said that four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people is a decent ceiling .\n\u201c If I go from one to two to three [ coronavirus cases a day ] , it \u2019 s different than going from 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000 , even though the percent difference is the same , \u201d Shahpar said . \u201c That \u2019 s why you have to take into account the overall level , too . \u201d\nTo put it another way , it \u2019 s not enough for daily new Covid-19 cases to drop , even for weeks . Cases also should fall below a certain level before a state can be deemed truly safe .\nAt the same time , if your state is now below four daily new cases per 100,000 but it \u2019 s seen a recent uptick in cases , that \u2019 s a reason for caution . Even the worst-hit states , after all , began with a handful of cases before they saw an exponential surge .\nBut if your state is below the threshold , it \u2019 s in a pretty solid place relative to most other states .\nWhat \u2019 s the goal ? At least 150 tests per 100,000 people per day , based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and Census Bureau .\nWhich states meet the goal ? Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , California , Connecticut , Delaware , Florida , Illinois , Iowa , Louisiana , Michigan , Minnesota , Mississippi , Montana , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , Utah , and Wisconsin \u2014 for a total of 26 states . Washington , DC , did as well .\nWhy is this important ? Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic , experts have argued that the US needs the capacity for at least 500,000 Covid-19 tests a day . Controlling for population , that adds up to about 150 new tests per 100,000 people per day .\nTesting is crucial to getting the coronavirus outbreak under control . When paired with contact tracing , testing lets officials track the scale of the outbreak , isolate the sick , quarantine those the sick came into contact with , and deploy community-wide efforts as necessary . Testing and tracing are how other countries , like South Korea and Germany , have managed to control their outbreaks and started to reopen their economies .\nThe idea , experts said , is to have enough surveillance to detect embers before they turn into full wildfires .\n\u201c States should be shoring up their testing capacity not just for what it looks like right now while everyone \u2019 s in their homes , but as people start to move more , \u201d Jen Kates , the director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation , told me . \u201c As people start doing more movement , you \u2019 ll have to test more , because people are going to come into contact with each other more . \u201d\nThe 500,000-a-day goal is the minimum . Some experts have recommended as many as millions of tests nationwide each day . But 500,000 is the most often-cited goal , and it \u2019 s , at the very least , a good start .\nThis goal is supposed to be for diagnostic tests , not antibody tests . Diagnostic tests gauge whether a person has the virus in their system and is , therefore , sick right at the moment of the test . Antibody tests check if someone ever developed antibodies to the virus to see if they had ever been sick in the past . Since diagnostic tests give a more recent gauge of the level of infection , they \u2019 re seen as much more reliable for evaluating the current state of the Covid-19 outbreak in a state .\nBut some states have mixed up numbers for diagnostic and antibody tests , which could skew the data collected by the Covid Tracking Project .\n\u201c The virus isn \u2019 t going to care whether they were manipulating the numbers or not in order to look more favorable ; it \u2019 s going to continue to spread , \u201d Crystal Watson , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , told me . \u201c It \u2019 s better to really understand what \u2019 s going on and report that accurately . \u201d\nFor states honestly reporting these numbers , though , they \u2019 re a critical measure of their ability to detect , control , and contain coronavirus outbreaks .\nWhat \u2019 s the goal ? Below 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the past week , based on data from the Covid Tracking Project .\nWhich states meet the goal ? Alaska , Connecticut , Delaware , Hawaii , Illinois , Indiana , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Montana , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , Virginia , Washington , West Virginia , and Wyoming \u2014 for a total of 26 states . Washington , DC , did as well .\nWhy is this important ? The positive or positivity rate , which tracks how many tests come back positive for Covid-19 , is another way to measure testing capacity .\nGenerally , a higher positive rate suggests there \u2019 s not enough testing happening . An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people , many of whom don \u2019 t have the disease or don \u2019 t show severe symptoms . The positive testing rate in South Korea , for example , is below 2 percent . High positive rates indicate only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested , so there \u2019 s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak .\nPreviously , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommended a maximum positive rate of 10 percent . But the WHO more recently recommended 5 percent , which is in line with the rate for countries that have better managed to better control their outbreaks , like Germany , New Zealand , and South Korea . \u201c Even lower is better , \u201d Shahpar said .\nThe positive rate data is subject to the same limitations as the overall testing data from the Covid Tracking Project . So if a state includes antibody tests in its test count , it could skew the positive rate to look better than it is . States only risk hurting themselves if they do this .\nWhat \u2019 s the goal ? Below 60 percent occupancy of ICU beds in hospitals , based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\nWhich states meet the goal ? Alaska , Delaware , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Nebraska , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , North Dakota , Ohio , South Dakota , Wisconsin , and Wyoming \u2014 for a total of 17 states .\nWhy is this important ? If a pandemic hits , the health care system needs to be ready to treat the most severe cases and potentially save lives . That \u2019 s the key goal of \u201c flattening the curve \u201d and \u201c raising the line , \u201d in which social distancing helps reduce the spread of the disease so the health care system can maintain and grow its capacity to treat an influx of Covid-19 patients .\n\u201c There \u2019 s this idea that in six weeks we can open more things , \u201d Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , told me . \u201c But the virus is still there . It \u2019 s all about making sure that the case count isn \u2019 t too immense for our hospital system to deal with . \u201d\nThe aim is to avoid the nightmare scenario that Italy went through when it had more Covid-19 cases than its health care system could handle , leading to hospitals turning away even dangerously ill patients .\nTo gauge this , experts recommended looking at ICU capacity , with states aiming to have at most 60 percent occupancy in their ICUs .\nA big limitation in the metric : It \u2019 s based on data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of only some hospitals in each state . So it might not be fully representative of hospital capacity throughout an entire state . But it \u2019 s the best , most current data available .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s map is just one way of tracking success against the coronavirus . Other groups have come up with their own measures , including Covid Act Now , Covid Exit Strategy , and Test and Trace . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s model uses more up-to-date data than some of these other examples , while focusing not just on the state of the pandemic but states \u2019 readiness to contain Covid-19 outbreaks in the future .\nVery few states hit all the marks recommended by experts . But even those that do shouldn \u2019 t consider the pandemic over . They should continue to improve \u2014 for example , getting the positive rate below even 1 percent , as in New Zealand \u2014 and look at even more granular metrics , such as at the city or county level .\nMeeting the benchmarks , however , indicates a state is better equipped to contain future coronavirus outbreaks as it eases previous restrictions .\nExperts emphasized that states have to keep hitting all these goals week after week and day after day \u2014 Covid-19 cases must remain low , testing ability needs to stay high , and hospital capacity should be good enough for an influx of patients \u2014 until the pandemic is truly over , whether thanks to a vaccine or other means . Otherwise , a future wave of coronavirus cases , as seen in past pandemics , could kill many more people .\n\u201c You need to have all the metrics met , \u201d Popescu said . \u201c This needs to be a very incremental , slow process to ensure success . \u201d\nAnd if the numbers do start trending in the wrong direction , states should be ready to shut down at least some parts of the economy again . Maybe not as much as before , as we learn which places are truly at risk of increasing spread . But experts caution that future shutdowns will likely be necessary to some extent .\n\u201c I do worry we \u2019 re going to see surges of cases and hot spots , \u201d Watson said . \u201c We do need to keep pushing on building those capacities . \u2026 Otherwise , we \u2019 re just rolling the dice on the spread of the virus . It \u2019 s better if we have more control of the spread . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s another reason these metrics , along with broader coronavirus surveillance , are so important : They not only help show how far along states are in dealing with their current Covid-19 outbreaks , but will help track progress to stop and prevent future crises as well .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .

But the metrics can at least help give states an idea of how far along they are in finally starting to open back up.\n\nGoal 1: A sustained two-week drop in coronavirus cases\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal? A 10 percent drop in daily new coronavirus cases compared to two weeks ago and a 5 percent drop in cases compared to one week ago, based on data from the New York Times.\n\nWhich states meet the goal? Massachusetts and Rhode Island \u2014 just two states. Washington, DC, did as well.\n\nWhy is this important? Guidance from the White House and several independent groups emphasize that states need to see coronavirus cases drop consistently over two weeks before they can say they\u2019re ready to begin reopening.

Fewer than four daily new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the New York Times and Census Bureau.\n\nWhich states meet the goal? Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia \u2014 11 states.\n\nWhy is this important?

Even the worst-hit states, after all, began with a handful of cases before they saw an exponential surge.\n\nBut if your state is below the threshold, it\u2019s in a pretty solid place relative to most other states.\n\nGoal 3: High coronavirus testing capacity\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal? At least 150 tests per 100,000 people per day, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project and Census Bureau.\n\nWhich states meet the goal? Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin \u2014 for a total of 26 states. Washington, DC, did as well.\n\nWhy is this important? Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, experts have argued that the US needs the capacity for at least 500,000 Covid-19 tests a day. Controlling for population, that adds up to about 150 new tests per 100,000 people per day.\n\nTesting is crucial to getting the coronavirus outbreak under control. When paired with contact tracing, testing lets officials track the scale of the outbreak, isolate the sick, quarantine those the sick came into contact with, and deploy community-wide efforts as necessary. Testing and tracing are how other countries, like South Korea and Germany, have managed to control their outbreaks and started to reopen their economies.\n\nThe idea, experts said, is to have enough surveillance to detect embers before they turn into full wildfires.\n\n\u201cStates should be shoring up their testing capacity not just for what it looks like right now while everyone\u2019s in their homes, but as people start to move more,\u201d Jen Kates, the director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me. \u201cAs people start doing more movement, you\u2019ll have to test more, because people are going to come into contact with each other more.\u201d\n\nThe 500,000-a-day goal is the minimum. Some experts have recommended as many as millions of tests nationwide each day. But 500,000 is the most often-cited goal, and it\u2019s, at the very least, a good start.\n\nThis goal is supposed to be for diagnostic tests, not antibody tests.

Since diagnostic tests give a more recent gauge of the level of infection, they\u2019re seen as much more reliable for evaluating the current state of the Covid-19 outbreak in a state.\n\nBut some states have mixed up numbers for diagnostic and antibody tests, which could skew the data collected by the Covid Tracking Project.\n\n\u201cThe virus isn\u2019t going to care whether they were manipulating the numbers or not in order to look more favorable; it\u2019s going to continue to spread,\u201d Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s better to really understand what\u2019s going on and report that accurately.\u201d\n\nFor states honestly reporting these numbers, though, they\u2019re a critical measure of their ability to detect, control, and contain coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nGoal 4: A low test positive rate\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal? Below 5 percent of coronavirus tests coming back positive over the past week, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project.\n\nWhich states meet the goal? Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming \u2014 for a total of 26 states. Washington, DC, did as well.\n\nWhy is this important? The positive or positivity rate, which tracks how many tests come back positive for Covid-19, is another way to measure testing capacity.\n\nGenerally, a higher positive rate suggests there\u2019s not enough testing happening. An area with adequate testing should be testing lots and lots of people, many of whom don\u2019t have the disease or don\u2019t show severe symptoms. The positive testing rate in South Korea, for example, is below 2 percent. High positive rates indicate only people with obvious symptoms are getting tested, so there\u2019s not quite enough testing to match the scope of an outbreak.\n\nPreviously, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a maximum positive rate of 10 percent. But the WHO more recently recommended 5 percent, which is in line with the rate for countries that have better managed to better control their outbreaks, like Germany, New Zealand, and South Korea. \u201cEven lower is better,\u201d Shahpar said.\n\nThe positive rate data is subject to the same limitations as the overall testing data from the Covid Tracking Project. So if a state includes antibody tests in its test count, it could skew the positive rate to look better than it is. States only risk hurting themselves if they do this.\n\nGoal 5: Availability of ICU beds\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal? Below 60 percent occupancy of ICU beds in hospitals, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhich states meet the goal? Alaska, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming \u2014 for a total of 17 states.\n\nWhy is this important? If a pandemic hits, the health care system needs to be ready to treat the most severe cases and potentially save lives. That\u2019s the key goal of \u201cflattening the curve\u201d and \u201craising the line,\u201d in which social distancing helps reduce the spread of the disease so the health care system can maintain and grow its capacity to treat an influx of Covid-19 patients.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that in six weeks we can open more things,\u201d Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told me. \u201cBut the virus is still there. It\u2019s all about making sure that the case count isn\u2019t too immense for our hospital system to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe aim is to avoid the nightmare scenario that Italy went through when it had more Covid-19 cases than its health care system could handle, leading to hospitals turning away even dangerously ill patients.\n\nTo gauge this, experts recommended looking at ICU capacity, with states aiming to have at most 60 percent occupancy in their ICUs.\n\nA big limitation in the metric: It\u2019s based on data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of only some hospitals in each state. So it might not be fully representative of hospital capacity throughout an entire state. But it\u2019s the best, most current data available.\n\nHitting the benchmarks is the beginning, not the end\n\nVox\u2019s map is just one way of tracking success against the coronavirus. Other groups have come up with their own measures, including Covid Act Now, Covid Exit Strategy, and Test and Trace. Vox\u2019s model uses more up-to-date data than some of these other examples, while focusing not just on the state of the pandemic but states\u2019 readiness to contain Covid-19 outbreaks in the future.\n\nVery few states hit all the marks recommended by experts. But even those that do shouldn\u2019t consider the pandemic over. They should continue to improve \u2014 for example, getting the positive rate below even 1 percent, as in New Zealand \u2014 and look at even more granular metrics, such as at the city or county level.\n\nMeeting the benchmarks, however, indicates a state is better equipped to contain future coronavirus outbreaks as it eases previous restrictions.\n\nExperts emphasized that states have to keep hitting all these goals week after week and day after day \u2014 Covid-19 cases must remain low, testing ability needs to stay high, and hospital capacity should be good enough for an influx of patients \u2014 until the pandemic is truly over, whether thanks to a vaccine or other means. Otherwise, a future wave of coronavirus cases, as seen in past pandemics, could kill many more people.\n\n\u201cYou need to have all the metrics met,\u201d Popescu said. \u201cThis needs to be a very incremental, slow process to ensure success.\u201d\n\nAnd if the numbers do start trending in the wrong direction, states should be ready to shut down at least some parts of the economy again. Maybe not as much as before, as we learn which places are truly at risk of increasing spread. But experts caution that future shutdowns will likely be necessary to some extent.\n\n\u201cI do worry we\u2019re going to see surges of cases and hot spots,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe do need to keep pushing on building those capacities. \u2026 Otherwise, we\u2019re just rolling the dice on the spread of the virus. It\u2019s better if we have more control of the spread.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s another reason these metrics, along with broader coronavirus surveillance, are so important: They not only help show how far along states are in dealing with their current Covid-19 outbreaks, but will help track progress to stop and prevent future crises as well.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
