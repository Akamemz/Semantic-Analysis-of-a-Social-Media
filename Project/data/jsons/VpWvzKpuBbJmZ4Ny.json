    "content": "President Trump announced Friday that he is pulling the U.S. out of its Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia , saying Moscow has been cheating for years on the 1987 pact .\n\u201c The United States has fully adhered to the INF Treaty for more than 30 years , but we will not remain constrained by its terms while Russia misrepresents its actions , \u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement . \u201c We can not be the only country in the world unilaterally bound by this treaty , or any other . \u201d\nHe said the withdrawal will be completed in six months unless Russia comes back into compliance by destroying all of its violating missiles , launchers and associated equipment .\nNATO said it \u201c fully supports \u201d Mr. Trump \u2019 s move . NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia \u201c is in material breach \u201d of the INF Treaty and must use the next six months to return to full , verifiable compliance \u201c or bear sole responsibility for its demise . \u201d\nMr. Trump said the U.S. stands ready \u201c to engage with Russia on arms control negotiations that meet these criteria , and , importantly , once that is done , develop , perhaps for the first time ever , an outstanding relationship on economic , trade , political , and military levels . \u201d\n\u201c This would be a fantastic thing for Russia and the United States , and would also be great for the world , \u201d he said .\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the withdrawal was justified because \u201c Russia has jeopardized the United States \u2019 security interests \u201d by deploying a particular missile system in Europe .\nThe treaty , which had prohibited the U.S. and Russia from building or deploying land-based missiles and launch systems with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles , was designed to block the spread of so-called \u201c tactical nukes \u201d around the globe , particularly in Europe , partly out of fear the less powerful bombs were more likely to be used in an actual shooting war .\nU.S. officials since 2014 have accused Moscow of breaching the INF , specifically through the deployment of a cruise missile known as the Novator 9M729 .\n\u201c We can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it , \u201d Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department Friday morning .\n\u201c Russia \u2019 s violations put millions of Europeans and Americans at greater risk , \u201d he said . \u201c It is our duty to respond appropriately . \u201d\n\u201c Countries must be held accountable when they break the rules , \u201d Mr. Pompeo added .\nRussia has acknowledged the 9M729 system \u2019 s existence but has claimed it does not violate the treaty .\nThe six-month period before the U.S. fully pulls out of the treaty is \u201c Russia \u2019 s final chance \u201d to restore the commitment , according to a senior administration official .\n\u201c Russia continues to deny its violation , \u201d the official said Friday , and \u201c is the one that has created a threat that exists that we successfully ended about 30 years ago . \u201d\n\u201c We can not be the only country bound by a treaty , \u201d the official told reporters . \u201c What purpose does it serve for the U.S. to be unilaterally bound to the treaty ? \u201d\nThe six-month waiting period is standard for most international treaties . It is intended to give other parties a final opportunity to restore its commitment .\n\u201c For [ Russian President Vladimir ] Putin this is very much about his neighbors , China being one of them , \u201d the senior administration official said . \u201c For the United States , this is strictly about the threat this poses to arms control . \u201d\nChina and Iran are not bound by the INF treaty . Each country has thousands of the missiles in dispute and banned by the existing treaty .\nAnalysts say China , particularly , has developed large numbers of missiles that would violate the treaty , including the so-called DF-26 missile , informally dubbed the \u201c Guam Killer . \u201d\nRepublican Sen. James Risch of Idaho , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said he supports the move .\n\u201c I know that we have the unanimity of our allies in this decision , and we will continue to consult with them over the next six months as we approach the withdrawal date , \u201d Mr. Risch said .\nHe said the treaty has become outdated and hasn \u2019 t stopped Russia from cheating .\n\u201c For the past several years , the Russian government has systematically violated the INF Treaty and deployed systems that undermine the stability that the treaty helped create , \u201d he said . \u201c Russian actions represent a material breach of the treaty , and it is abundantly clear : The United States is the only country limited by the INF Treaty . \u201d\nHe said Moscow has had \u201c endless opportunities to change their bad behavior \u201d but has failed to do so .\n\u201c The time has come to set the treaty aside and develop alternative avenues toward the security the treaty once provided , \u201d Mr. Risch said .\nSome experts have argued that Russia developed the land-based missile because Moscow can not compete with comparable U.S. sea- and air-based systems , which were not restricted by the treaty .\nThe decision was not a surprise to the Kremlin , which has claimed the Trump administration has long been determined to undermine the deal . Foreign Minister Dmitry Ryabkov , Russia \u2019 s top negotiator on the pact , denied again Friday that Russia had violated the terms of the INF and said Moscow was still willing to abide by its terms despite the U.S. withdrawal .\n\u201c We believe that the treaty is needed .
