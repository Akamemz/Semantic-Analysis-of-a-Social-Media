But a recent WSJ editorial seems to put the brakes on this idea , at least in one important area . What shall we do about all of those immigrants yearning not only for freedom , but for a good job ? Surely the Democrats and their largest backers are champing at the bit to put them all to work , right ? Well\u2026 maybe not all of them .\nThe bipartisan Gang of Eight Senate talks on immigration are continuing , with avowals that a deal is done or close to it . But we also keep hearing that it may not include a flexible guest-worker program rooted in the realities of the U.S. labor market , and that some Republicans may nonetheless go along for the ride . Specifically , the AFL-CIO has been insisting on a guest program for low-skilled workers to start at a mere 10,000 visas a year , and the Senators may agree on as few as 20,000 . These would be the total number of visas for workers across the entire U.S. economy outside of high-tech or agriculture\u2014the likes of construction , hotels and restaurants , landscaping , among so many others . To put that in perspective , in 2011 the U.S. admitted more than two million temporary workers in a work force of 154 million .\nAh\u2026 it \u2019 s our old friends in the AFL-CIO again . They \u2019 re big supporters of the Democrats and the general progressive agenda .
