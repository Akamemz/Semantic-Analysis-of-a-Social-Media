If he follows through , this would be Mr. Trump 's first veto since taking office .\nI am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats ( not even mentioned in Bill ) and the BORDER WALL , which is desperately needed for our National Defense , is not fully funded . \u2014 Donald J.
