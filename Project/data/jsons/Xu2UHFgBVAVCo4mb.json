Cars are meant to be driven. Sitting still isn\u2019t healthy for them, but there are a few preventive measures you can take that will help ensure your car is in top condition when you start it next.\n\n1. Start it and move it periodically\n\nIf at all possible, start the engine once every other week and move the car around a little. Even if it\u2019s just up and down your driveway followed by a few minutes of idling to get the engine to operating temperature, you\u2019re helping to circulate fluids in the car.

Cover your car up\n\nIf your car is parked outside, invest in a good cover to protect the paint, the interior and all the rubber trim. Don\u2019t simply use a tarp, which can quickly scratch paint and trap water underneath, leading to rust. Instead, find a quality soft cover specifically designed to breathe.\n\nLeaving your car out in the sun wreaks havoc on its paint and its rubber trim.

Perform a few services\n\nNow\u2019s a great time to perform a few services on your car, many of which are easier than you might expect.
