Another is so wealthy he bragged of owning a Gucci store that was worth more than 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney .\nAnother worked for multiple multinational banks that earned him millions and was born to a moneyed political dynasty .\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio , meanwhile , recently had to liquidate a retirement fund to pay for a new fridge .\nThat detail was part of an array of questionable financial decisions -- including bad real-estate deals , hundreds of thousands of dollars in school debt and a handful of luxury purchases , including an $ 80,000 boat -- that have left Rubio one of the poorest candidates in the GOP presidential field , with an estimated net worth of just $ 444,000 in 2013 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Taken together , Rubio 's financial choices prompted The New York Times to outline `` persistent doubts about his financial management '' that could impact his presidential bid in a profile this week .\nBut they 're also , in a field full of millionaires , a potential asset in the race to appeal to average voters that will choose America 's next president in 2016 .\nLarry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics , joked that Rubio 's now got `` a new slogan . ''\n`` He 's just like you -- right down to the flaws . ''\n`` There are millions of Americans , '' Sabato noted , `` who do n't have trust funds and who struggle as we have and who 've made some mistakes on the road . ''\nDuring a cycle when growing income inequality and the shrinking middle class are going to take center stage , Rubio 's financial struggles could help him rise above the pack as an Average Joe capable of appealing to middle-class Americans also experiencing the same difficulties .\n`` These are problems that everyday Americans face . I do n't see it as a bad thing , '' said Nelson Diaz , a Republican lobbyist and top aide to Rubio during his time as speaker of the Florida House . `` Whether it 's Marco or any other candidate , the fact that they can relate to these issues gives them a different type of understanding and experience when they go into the White House .
