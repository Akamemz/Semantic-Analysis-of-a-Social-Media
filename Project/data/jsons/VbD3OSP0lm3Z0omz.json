    "content": "For President Obama and the press , the past year has been anything but a slobbering love affair .\nAfter the high point of his inauguration , I \u2019 d say Obama has gotten pretty rough coverage that fairly mirrors the rough passage of his fifth year in office . This has been capped by the last two months , with the ObamaCare fiasco dominating the coverage and casting doubt on the competence of the president and his team .\nEven the improvements made to the health care website hasn \u2019 t spared the Obama team fresh criticism that some of the information being submitted to insurance companies is inaccurate , which could leave many without coverage .\nAnd the lack of a significant domestic accomplishment leaves Obama \u2019 s defenders with few talking points . You know you \u2019 re having time when the only relief you get is talking to the Iranians about nukes ( and even that agreement is proving a tough sell on the Hill ) .\nNow , thanks to a journalistic convention , Obama is starting to get hit by a new wave of negative press . As we head into the Christmas season , the pundits are easing into their year-end wrap-ups , and are turning thumbs-down on the president \u2019 s tenure .\n\u201c By almost any measure , this has been a lost year for Obama on the domestic front , \u201d says the Washington Post \u2019 s Dan Balz . \u201c The flawed rollout of the health-care law , the most important initiative of his tenure , has been a huge setback . His main legislative efforts have either disappeared or are stalled . The economy continues to improve , but the fruits have been unevenly distributed . The government shutdown damaged the opposition , but the president \u2019 s ratings also are at record lows .\n\u201c This is hardly what Obama could have envisioned as he looked toward his second term in the weeks after his reelection . \u201d\nBalz is always measured in his judgments , so that amounts to a serious slam .\nChuck Todd and his co-authors at MSNBC echo the tone :\n\u201c It \u2019 s worth recapping how rough 2013 has been for President Obama . The struggles with the federal website ( more on that below ) have dominated the last two months , and have sent his approval ratings to new lows . But before that , it was the damaging NSA/Snowden leaks . Before that , it was the IRS-Benghazi-leak stories ( which have definitely lost their punch since the summer ) . And before that , it was the failure to get gun-control through the U.S. Senate . \u201d\nAnd Politico has this telling quote from GOP strategist Alex Castellanos about the impact on Hillary :\n\u201c Hillary Clinton is the life raft on Obama \u2019 s sinking ship : Obama \u2019 s troops would be a lot less likely to abandon ship if she wasn \u2019 t around . Hillary has to separate from Obama to win the general election but has to hug him close to win the nomination . If she leaves any room in the primaries between Obama and her own candidacy , she creates an opening for Elizabeth Warren . It \u2019 s going to be a tough call to figure out how close to hug the leper . \u201d\nSo according to this admittedly partisan analysis , the prospect of Hillary winning in 2016 is helping Barack in 2013 because she \u2019 s his former secretary of State .\nBut is it helping Hillary ? Another Politico piece\u2014this one about Chuck Hagel\u2014contains this revealing comment from a former Bill Clinton defense official who recently turned down a Pentagon job :\n\u201c To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect . Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration , when you can make $ 300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary ? \u201d\nBecause she might not win ? Besides , Obama still has three years to go . And National Journal \u2019 s Ron Fournier , who has been harping on Obama \u2019 s lack of leadership , says :\n\u201c President Obama needs to fire himself . Not literally , of course , but practically : He needs to shake up his team so thoroughly that the new blood imposes change on how he manages the federal bureaucracy and leads .\n\u201c A series of self-inflicted wounds during his fifth year in office , capped by the botched launch of the Affordable Care Act , have Americans questioning the president 's competence and credibility . \u201d\nWe \u2019 ll give the final word to First Read , with its inevitable Chuck Todd college football reference :\n\u201c But here \u2019 s the thing about politics : It can change in the blink of an eye . Who \u2019 s up can go down ; who \u2019 s down can go up .
