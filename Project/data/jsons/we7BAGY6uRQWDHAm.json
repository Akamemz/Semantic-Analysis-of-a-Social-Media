Mass incarcerations , torture and the longest digital siege ever imposed in a democracy mean that daily life for most Kashmiris has now become a dire struggle .\nThe purpose of these rent-a-diplomat tours is to shore up a narrative of normalcy in Kashmir . But as I saw images of carefully choreographed meetings with officials , spooks , businessmen and newly birthed political stooges , I thought of other places of interest that the delegates might be persuaded to see , should they or others like them visit again .\nKashmiris have for years been writing in blood that they want 'Aazadi ' , to self-determine their destiny\nSince I happen to know Srinagar \u2013 the city of my birth and youth \u2013 probably slightly better than , let \u2019 s say , the visiting French envoy and his handlers , I suggest you start in the immediate vicinity of the majestic palace-turned-hotel where the international delegates \u2013 brought in to see Kashmiris , with their own eyes , no less \u2013 were forced to stay .\nTake a short walk around the hills here and you could take photos of a gorgeously redecorated building known as Papa II or Fairview . This was one of the most notorious torture centres where detained Kashmiris \u2013 suspected of involvement in insurgency against Indian rule \u2013 were subjected to unspeakable torture in the 1990s . It has since been redecorated and turned into an official residence where Kashmir \u2019 s last chief minister lived . A few echoes of those tormented inside might ring faintly , but what \u2019 s a postcard-pretty , old villa without fitting sound effects ?\nNot too far from there , you could visit the beautifully appointed guesthouses and hotels in which various species of Kashmiri politician have been kept as grumpy guests of the state . They won \u2019 t talk freely , as it \u2019 s kind of illegal in Kashmir , but , hey , those codes of modern democracy and freedom of speech , as practised in Berlin or Paris ( and sometimes in Delhi ) , need not apply to an indigenous people in a faraway mountainous region .\nIf you like your medieval towns full of exotic charms , a quick detour into the Martyr \u2019 s Graveyard of Srinagar \u2013 where a cross-section of those slain by India \u2019 s armed forces over the years are buried \u2013 could get you face-to-face with lots of Arabesque gravestones . You must recite Rumi here .\nJust a few minutes from the Dal Lake , where you grudgingly had to take photos as you reclined in the traditional Kashmiri water taxi , you could go on a historical walk in the labyrinths of the old city . Here you could embark on a tour of the families who have lost their boys and girls to Indian bullets over the years . But if seeing memorial rooms of loss and death so soon after selfies at an idyllic lake isn \u2019 t your cup of tea , you could speak to living victims , those who have dark holes in place of eyes . Please note that it might be rude to ask your hosts how and why these kids were blinded .\nMy son is one of Kashmir \u2019 s \u2018 disappeared \u2019 . When will India tell the truth about their fate ? | Parveena Ahangar Read more\nIn the photos posted by a news agency which is known for its alacrity in reporting lovely things for the state , one couldn \u2019 t see any common Kashmiris . But worry not , the next time you go , you could ask your local fixers to find a funeral and join in with prayers for the soul of the departed . To see ordinary Kashmiris , of all shapes , sizes , and ages , you need not even visit Kashmir . Many are scattered across north Indian prisons \u2013 most have not been charged , and do not have robust legal aid \u2013 providing a real chance to talk to people in their natural habitat .\nYou must then visit the only psychiatric hospital in Srinagar . Here you can find your average distressed native anywhere you look , as the incidence of deep trauma among us has risen because of the long siege of our earthly paradise .

It \u2019 s not the first time that European diplomatics in India have made themselves useful on the Kashmir front . In 2013 , the then German ambassador , Michael Steiner , put on a concert for the conductor Zubin Mehta in a picturesque garden on the shores of Dal Lake . We were told it was to bring peace and harmony to the people of Kashmir . Attended mainly by spooks , bureaucrats , officials , politicians and a few fawning journalists , the concert ended up resembling a dark skit straight out of a war comedy : hours before the concert a motorist was shot and wounded for failing to obey orders to stop . Meanwhile in south Kashmir , four Kashmiris were killed by Indian paramilitaries , as the invitation-only guests listened to rhapsodic orchestral music in a walled garden surrounded by soldiers with semi-automatic weapons .\nTourist envoys have occasionally visited Kashmir to examine , ascertain and report on we are told , what Kashmiris really want , despite Kashmiris having for years written in blood that they want azadi , to self-determine their destiny .
