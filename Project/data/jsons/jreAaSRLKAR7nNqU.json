Patty Murray , who will be the third-ranking Senate Democrat in the new Congress . `` They have failed to come up with any plausible way to provide care and health care insurance for so many people . If they take it away , they better tell us how to fix it because they broke it . ''\nThe strong words indicate the challenges ahead for GOP leaders and the Trump administration as they plan an immediate assault on President Barack Obama 's signature legislative item . Behind the scenes , top Republicans are plotting on moving forward with a budget plan unusually early -- in January -- in order to allow them to circumvent a Democratic filibuster in the Senate and repeal much of Obamacare on a straight-party line vote around the time Trump is sworn into office .\nBut to replace Obamacare under the Senate rules , Republicans would need the support of at least eight Democratic senators in order to reach the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster . And top Democrats are warning that the GOP will get little cooperation from their caucus on a replacement plan if they dismantle the health care law .\n`` They 're going to find repealing Obamacare without putting in a replacement will be far more disastrous and less clever than they think , '' New York Sen. Chuck Schumer , the incoming Senate Democratic leader , told CNN Thursday . `` That 's all I 'm going to say . ''\nRepublicans are gambling that Democrats will buckle , particularly Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 from states Trump won -- as they face pressure to put a new system in place to avoid chaos in the health care system .\nSchumer 's chief deputy , Dick Durbin of Illinois , said Republicans have a `` responsibility as far as I 'm concerned about coming up with a replacement . ''\nAsked if that meant that he 'd support Democratic efforts to block a replacement plan , Durbin pushed back .\n`` Who loses with that approach ? If they are successful in repealing it , and we say , 'We 're going to stop you in replacing it , ' '' Durbin said . I want to know what the replacement is going to be . I want to know if it 's real protection , and as good as [ the Affordable Care Act ] for the millions who count on it . ''\nIn concert with the Trump transition team , GOP leaders are weighing a plan that would delay the health care repeal from taking effect for up to three years , giving Congress time to craft a new system to provide health insurance from the millions who could lose it . They are also planning an ambitious legislative agenda in the new year , moving forward on a plan to rewrite the tax code , a new government funding bill and confirming a spate of Trump 's nominees , including to the Supreme Court .\nBut dealing with the red-hot issue of health care could be the trickiest -- especially since there 's no consensus within the GOP yet on what the replacement plan would look like .\nEven if the GOP writes into its legislation that a repeal wo n't take effect for three years , some health policy experts warn that the health care system could collapse immediately because insurers may pull out of the expiring system . That could intensify pressure on the GOP to find a solution right away .\nThe issue has been discussed at length between House Speaker Paul Ryan , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and senior Trump officials , sources say . And it dominated talk among top House Republicans in a closed-door meeting Thursday .\nOklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole , who attended the meeting , conceded that moving ahead with repeal will put the burden on Republicans to lay out the next steps .\n`` We do really need to think through how do you do this without kicking a lot of people off of healthcare when they in good faith are responding to the system , '' Cole told CNN . He noted that his home state , which did n't opt to expand the Medicaid program to provide coverage , wo n't face the same kinds of challenges that most other states have , where they rely on federal resources for millions who have enrolled in plans .\nNorth Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows , who will chair the conservative House Freedom Caucus next Congress , said the GOP was still sorting out its plans on the issue .\n`` There 's still a lot of discussion about the transition . No one can explain yet what all the details will be , '' Meadows said Thursday , but said members all agree they want to start with the repeal component early in the new year .\nBut Cole is confident top GOP leaders working with Rep. Tom Price , R-Georgia , who is Trump 's nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services will methodically manage the process . Moreover , House Republicans on Thursday selected a loyal Ryan ally , Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon , to chair the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee , giving him a key role in drafting a replacement to the health care law .\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters earlier this week that he expected to move legislation to roll back the law first , and hammer out replacement legislation later .
