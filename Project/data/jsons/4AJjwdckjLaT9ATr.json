    "content": "Melania Trump never exactly warmed up to the role of campaign spouse . She \u2019 s been reluctant , reticent at best , and really mostly absent from the trail for much of the last 16 months . And why not ? The third Mrs. Trump liked her semi-private life as the wife of a New York real-estate billionaire turned reality star . She flitted around from one gala to another and split her days between the Trumps \u2019 gilded Fifth Avenue penthouse and country home , or flew on private planes to Palm Beach . So it makes sense that she was hesitant when her husband was mulling whether or not to throw his hat in the ring last year . \u201c I said to him , \u2018 You really need to think , because our family life will change . The three of us will change. \u2019 I know what it takes , traveling and all that stuff , \u201d she told Dujour magazine earlier this year . Once Donald Trump did decide to run , she made it clear that she would \u201c be a mom first , \u201d often sitting out the primary state shuffle that was running her husband and his older children ragged , before the general-election campaign dragged her once again into the national spotlight .\nWhen she did appear , she often remained a quiet presence , behind her poised , more comfortable stepdaughter Ivanka . Her introversion and desire to keep her personal politics private played a role in this . But the fact that Melania seemed to step into controversy without saying much at all certainly could not have encouraged her to be more public . When she did speak at the Republican National Convention , she was lauded for about three seconds before it appeared portions of her speech had been borrowed from a Democratic convention speech delivered by First Lady Michelle Obama eight years earlier . The media pounced on whether or not she had graduated from college with a degree , as an R.N.C . bio and her official Web site had boasted . And then there were questions about her immigration story\u2014claims her husband said there would be a press conference to address .\nThe press conference never happened . But that \u2019 s not to say Melania has been silent . On the contrary , she \u2019 s been the subject of one campaign hiccup after another . She threatened to sue a handful of news outlets that published a story insinuating that she had once been an escort for hire , resulting in a round of retractions and apologies . She has been vocal about her immigration status . She issued a statement after tapes leaked last week in which her then new husband is heard talking about going after married women and groping others without their consent . \u201c I hope people will accept his apology , as I have , \u201d she wrote . She turned up to the debate with a so-called hot-pink pussy bow tied around her neck\u2014what some said was a subtle sartorial nod to her husband \u2019 s recorded choice of words .\nOne couldn \u2019 t help but feel for Melania as a number of women came forward in the wake of those tapes , alleging they had been sexually assaulted by her husband ( claims that Donald vigorously denied ) , particularly as one surfaced from a People magazine reporter , Natasha Stoynoff , who wrote a detailed account of visiting the Trumps on the occasion of their first wedding anniversary . When a then heavily pregnant Melania went to change , the writer claimed , Donald kissed her and told her they were going to have an affair .\nA day after the report was published in People , Melania \u2019 s attorney , Charles Harder wrote the magazine and Stoynoff a letter demanding an apology and a retraction , which Melania posted on her Twitter account .
