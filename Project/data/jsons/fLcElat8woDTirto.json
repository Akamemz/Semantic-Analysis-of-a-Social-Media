Daum , a student at Woods Cross High School in Utah , became the target of the progressive social media mob when she wore a qipao , a dress whose roots are grounded in China , which set off the snowflake brigade . Daum found herself being accused of cultural appropriation . Yeah , we \u2019 re back to this crowd again . She was looking for something unique to wear , she wasn \u2019 t mocking Chinese culture , and to her credit , she would do it again knowing the consequences of her fashion choice .\nJeremy Lam was the person who appears to have set off the firestorm .\n\u201c I 'm proud of my culture , including the extreme barriers marginalized people within that culture have had to overcome those obstacles . For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience , is parallel to colonial ideology , \u201d he explained in a Twitter thread .\nMy culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress . https : //t.co/vhkNOPevKD \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 27 , 2018\nThe qipao was originally a loose dress/garment without shape , made for Chinese women to clean the house and do other domestic chores with . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018\nIt was then altered and embroidered as a beautiful form-fitting outfit to wear publically , which Chinese women were not allowed to do at during the times of extreme patriarchal oppression . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018\nIn a time where Asian women were silenced they were able to create , not only a piece of art but a symbol of activism . This piece of clothing embraced femininity , confidence , and gender equality through its beautiful , eye-catching appearance . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018\nIt even broke the division of financial classes ! It could be made with high-quality materials that only the upper class could afford such as special silks and linens , but a dress just as beautiful could have been made with just cotton and low-quality linen . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018\nFemme factory workers wore this dress ! ! ! And the style was then spread throughout Asian as a beautiful garment and sign of women 's liberation . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018\nI 'm proud of my culture , including the extreme barriers marginalized people within that culture have had to overcome those obstacles . For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience , is parallel to colonial ideology . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 28 , 2018\nHe then gave himself a pat on the back for starting this discussion on race :\n1 . I \u2019 ve been incredibly blessed for the opportunity to have sparked such an interesting and polarizing conversation on race relations in the status quo . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018\n2 . I apologize if any of the interactions you \u2019 ve had on here have been negative and insensitive . I apologize if I have hurt you \u2019 re feelings . I will not apologize , however , for voicing my concerns and beliefs . I owe it to myself , family and friends to express my opinions . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018\n3 . In this period of time , I have experienced the most blatant and outward forms of racial backlash in my life . That if I hate America , and its values of being a mixing pot of culture , that I should just leave . This is not specific to me or my experience either , it \u2019 s common . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018\n4 . Having an immigrant background , I can say Im blessed to live in the US . But this doesn \u2019 t mean that it \u2019 s without its issues . If those who try to make the US better thru a critical lense are told to just go back to their countries , how do we progress as an inclusive society ? \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018\n5 . I realize that what was conveyed could \u2019 ve been interpreted as speaking for others , and I \u2019 m sorry if I made you feel that way . When I say \u201c My culture \u201d that is exactly what I mean . My racial experience isn \u2019 t definitive of other experiences . But I \u2019 m tired of hiding mine . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018\n6 . Whether or not people agree with me I will stand for what I believe , because I feel in my heart that it \u2019 s right . I won \u2019 t be boxed in with the confines of the model minority stereotype . If I feel disrespected , I will tell you . I will stay angry , I will stay resilient . \u2014 Jeremy Lam ( @ jere_bare ) April 29 , 2018\nYeah , here \u2019 s the thing . This whole argument about cultural appropriation is crap . It \u2019 s just a way for the most left wing of left-wingers to keep themselves trapped in a glass case of emotion . As a Korean-American , I \u2019 m a member of the larger Asian community and I couldn \u2019 t care less what Daum wore at prom . I do hope she had a great time besides the total losers who try to find white , neo-colonialism in every aspect of life . You weren \u2019 t there . You don \u2019 t know this girl . What the hell is this ? David French had more on this insanity :\nIf you \u2019 re a normal human being , like the majority of Americans who saw their Instagram , Facebook , and Twitter feeds fill up with prom pictures last weekend , you thought that was a pretty girl in a pretty dress . Nothing more . But if you \u2019 re a toxic social-justice warrior , you saw something else . You saw oppression . You saw exploitation . You saw bigotry . You saw \u2014 gasp \u2014 \u201c cultural appropriation. \u201d The dress , you see , had obvious Asian influences , and Daum isn \u2019 t Asian : Daum , to her immense credit , has weathered the shamestorm without backing down . She says simply that she bought the dress because she thought it was \u201c beautiful \u201d and she \u201c admired the beauty of the culture. \u201d So , that \u2019 s the story . Here \u2019 s why it matters : It \u2019 s indicative of how the people who care the most about identity and oppression are seized by rage and unreason . And because cultures are shaped and defined by those who care the most , Daum \u2019 s story is not just a Twitter story ; it \u2019 s increasingly the American story . Let \u2019 s take the concept of \u201c cultural appropriation. \u201d It \u2019 s absurd down to its very definition . Susan Scafidi , author of Who Owns Culture ? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law , defines it like this : Taking intellectual property , traditional knowledge , cultural expressions , or artifacts from someone else \u2019 s culture without permission . This can include unauthorized use of another culture \u2019 s dance , dress , music , language , folklore , cuisine , traditional medicine , religious symbols , etc . It \u2019 s most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive , e.g . sacred objects . In a multi-ethnic , multi-racial culture like America \u2019 s , the potential for offense is unlimited . ( Moreover , who , exactly , is empowered to grant \u201c permission \u201d to wear clothing , cook food , or use language ? Is there a central registry ?\nWe pride ourselves in being a melting pot of culture . Anyone can be an American . Anyone can become an American . It \u2019 s a rich blend of cultures , whereas Asians are mostly homogenous societies . That \u2019 s not to say anything is wrong with that ; it \u2019 s just how they are . But our nation \u2019 s strength is grounded in the diversity of our people . I agree with French ; we need permission to eat at a Mexican restaurant ? Do I need to send a request to the Italian embassy to eat at Filomena in Georgetown ?\nHe appropriated silk from Thailand , crystals from Austria & made an asymmetrical mesh cutout for the neckline , inspired by Italian designers .\nArt emerges when you appropriate ideas from different cultures . # CulturalAppropriation pic.twitter.com/jsWMb3jvQB \u2014 Melissa Chen ( @ MsMelChen ) April 30 , 2018\nSomeone should 've advised me that appropriating the hairstyle of a male Korean J-pop singer was n't a good idea though .\nWell you live and you learn . Haha . \u2014 Melissa Chen ( @ MsMelChen ) April 30 , 2018\nHere was my thoughts on the whole Jeremy Lam situation . The kid is straight up racist as well and needs to step off his damn high horse . You can preach about racism and culture when you 're the Fkn racist lmao pic.twitter.com/o5HjOnwoWZ \u2014 Esaaaaaaaa ( @ EsaFung ) April 30 , 2018\nThe rules are so loose and subjective that any wackjob on the Left to throw a tantrum and blabber pseudo-intellectual drivel about oppression and cultural insensitivity . It was a prom dress . She wasn \u2019 t in yellow face . She wasn \u2019 t mocking Asian culture . This blow up was absolutely absurd and the fact that some , not all , in this country take cultural appropriation as a serious concept makes me weep for the future . Take a chill pill and grow up . That \u2019 s all . It was a high school prom . Everyone get it the hell together .\nYes , there are times where one 's culture is mocked through a vicious and racist lens . Yes , that happens .
