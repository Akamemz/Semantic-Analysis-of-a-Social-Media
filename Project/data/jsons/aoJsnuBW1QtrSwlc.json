Watch above .\nTrump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Monday amid reports of disagreements and infighting among the staff .\n`` I think what 's happened with the Trump campaign is , I think it 's fractured itself internally , '' Moreno-Riano said . `` I think that it is trying to meet a number of different objectives and keep a number of constituencies very , very happy and it has been unable to do so . ''\n`` And I think this is just symptomatic of a broader , a more deeper problem within the American electorate , particularly GOP evangelicals , '' he added .\nMoreno-Riano said the test for Trump is to find a way to bring his message under control and highlight the core concerns of GOP constituencies , including evangelicals .\n`` The dilemma has always been whether Trump himself has what I 'll call the internal character-based resources to pull this off , '' he explained . `` He is a man who is very direct , very strong-minded and the question is : Does he have enough discipline , both personally and professionally , enough political discipline to pull this off ?
