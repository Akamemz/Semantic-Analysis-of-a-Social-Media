    "content": "It \u2019 s Election Day in Georgia , where a House special election has put President Donald Trump \u2019 s popularity back on the ballot , turned suburban Atlanta into a battleground for the first time in a generation and obliterated campaign finance records .\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff has had a slight advantage in public polls against Republican Karen Handel , but the race could not be much closer after six months and $ 50 million spent to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in Congress . And both parties are closely watching the biggest House race ever for clues about how to fight the 2018 elections .\nHandel and Ossoff both tried to make the race about their own candidacies , with Handel touting deep roots in the district and Ossoff casting himself as a \u201c fresh , independent voice. \u201d But , ultimately , \u201c This race is a referendum on Republicans and the Trump administration nationally , no question , \u201d said Phil Kent , a Republican political commentator based in Georgia .\nHere are \u2588\u2588\u2588 's seven things to watch as the results roll in Tuesday night :\nEarly voting soared ahead of Election Day , with more than 140,000 voters casting their ballots early , some before embarking on summer vacations . Total turnout in the April primary topped 192,000 , and 2014 midterm levels ( about 210,000 voters ) are not far beyond .\nHigher turnout often benefits Democrats \u2014 but in a year when Democrats were already unusually enthusiastic , it could give Republicans a boost instead . Many more GOP voters showed up early this time than in the April all-party primary , which has some Republicans feeling good and some Democrats nervous .\n\u201c This is still a Republican-leaning district , and Republicans of all stripes have rallied around Karen , \u201d Kent said .

You can unsubscribe at any time .\nBut there 's a big question outstanding for Handel : Did the push to get Republicans to vote early just accelerate GOP voting instead of adding to it ? Handel will almost certainly do better in the early vote than Republicans did against Ossoff in April , but the Democrat could still win the election anyway .\nOssoff and Handel both played to the middle in the runoff . Ossoff kicked off his campaign in January by asking voters to \u201c Make Trump Furious , \u201d but he \u2019 s departed from the progressive playbook with a centrist message aimed at attracting disillusioned Republican voters .\nIt paid off in the primary , with one Republican firm estimating that at least 8 to 10 percent of GOP voters backed Ossoff , and Ossoff needs more than the Democratic base to win this district . But by rejecting a single-payer health care system and occasionally praising Trump , Ossoff could risk alienating hardcore progressives .\nNevertheless , most public polls show Ossoff almost completely unifying his party . \u201c There is no room to worry about who is the most progressive right now , \u201d said Michael Owens , chairman of the Cobb County Democratic Party . \u201c We understand that there is a spectrum , and this district is on the more moderate end . Ossoff fits that bill . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Handel has accepted fundraising help from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the district , but she regularly says that she is \u201c not an extension of the White House. \u201d It \u2019 s a move that some Republicans said may not excite the GOP base . But it also appeals to voters in a longtime Republican district that swung harder against Trump in 2016 than all but five House seats in the entire country .\nTrump won the district by under 2 points in November , and he is no more popular there now . That is the single biggest factor that made this race a nationally watched battleground , and Democrats are hoping the same backlash in affluent suburbs will help them in districts from California to Virginia next year .\n\u201c Republicans have to deal with the balancing act of the traditional suburban GOP voter and the more conservative , rural voters , \u201d said Craig Kidd , the first vice chairman of the Fulton County Republican Party . \u201c Georgia \u2019 s 6th District is to Trump what the rural districts were for Bill Clinton in 1993 . As soon as Clinton was seen as a liberal , Democrats got crushed in those seats , and in 1994 , Republicans gained them . \u201d\nBut Trump is not the only national figure intruding on this local special election . Republicans have wielded House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , who is also widely disliked in the district , against Ossoff . Ads from Republican groups have cast Ossoff as a puppet of liberal interests and a \u201c rubber stamp [ for ] Pelosi \u2019 s failed agenda , \u201d said Corry Bliss , executive director of the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund .\nSome Republicans argue the anti-Pelosi message has gotten stale after seven years , but if Handel wins Tuesday night , that will only reinforce the idea that she remains a potent driver of votes for the Republican base \u2014 just as Trump animates Democrats .\nAn Illinois man opened fire on GOP lawmakers , staffers and lobbyists practicing for the congressional baseball game last week , seriously wounding Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several others . The shooter had a long history of posting anti-Trump comments online , and the wall-to-wall coverage has Democrats worried about \u201c the impact of the shooting \u201d on driving GOP turnout , said one national Democrat involved in the race .\nThe Republican Party chairman in Georgia \u2019 s 11th District echoed that sentiment . \u201c The shooting is going to win this election for us , \u201d Brad Carver told The Washington Post . \u201c Because moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Handel and Ossoff \u2019 s campaigns both said they received threats following the attack in Virginia . `` Suspicious packages \u201d were delivered to Handel \u2019 s home , per a statement from her campaign last week .\nCandidates and incumbents eyeing the high-profile Georgia race ( and the circumstances that led to it ) are inevitably asking the question : Should I jump in or should I jump ship ?\n\u201c You will see more and more Republicans who are having private conversations \u2014 and more who will say it publicly \u2014 about their concerns over the administration and the direction of the presidency , \u201d said Chip Lake , a Republican consultant in Georgia . \u201c A lot of members are going to start thinking : Do I want to deal with this , or would I rather retire and relax ? \u201d\nSeveral Democrats have already cited the Georgia race as inspiration for their own campaigns , including Andy Kim , a former Obama administration official who launched a campaign against Republican Rep.

But it also appeals to voters in a longtime Republican district that swung harder against Trump in 2016 than all but five House seats in the entire country.\n\nThe national stakes\n\nTrump won the district by under 2 points in November, and he is no more popular there now. That is the single biggest factor that made this race a nationally watched battleground, and Democrats are hoping the same backlash in affluent suburbs will help them in districts from California to Virginia next year.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have to deal with the balancing act of the traditional suburban GOP voter and the more conservative, rural voters,\u201d said Craig Kidd, the first vice chairman of the Fulton County Republican Party. \u201cGeorgia\u2019s 6th District is to Trump what the rural districts were for Bill Clinton in 1993. As soon as Clinton was seen as a liberal, Democrats got crushed in those seats, and in 1994, Republicans gained them.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not the only national figure intruding on this local special election. Republicans have wielded House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is also widely disliked in the district, against Ossoff. Ads from Republican groups have cast Ossoff as a puppet of liberal interests and a \u201crubber stamp [for] Pelosi\u2019s failed agenda,\u201d said Corry Bliss, executive director of the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund.\n\nSome Republicans argue the anti-Pelosi message has gotten stale after seven years, but if Handel wins Tuesday night, that will only reinforce the idea that she remains a potent driver of votes for the Republican base \u2014 just as Trump animates Democrats.\n\nWill last week's congressional shooting affect the vote?\n\nAn Illinois man opened fire on GOP lawmakers, staffers and lobbyists practicing for the congressional baseball game last week, seriously wounding Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several others. The shooter had a long history of posting anti-Trump comments online, and the wall-to-wall coverage has Democrats worried about \u201cthe impact of the shooting\u201d on driving GOP turnout, said one national Democrat involved in the race.\n\nThe Republican Party chairman in Georgia\u2019s 11th District echoed that sentiment. \u201cThe shooting is going to win this election for us,\u201d Brad Carver told The Washington Post. \u201cBecause moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Handel and Ossoff\u2019s campaigns both said they received threats following the attack in Virginia. \"Suspicious packages\u201d were delivered to Handel\u2019s home, per a statement from her campaign last week.\n\nRecruitments and retirements\n\nCandidates and incumbents eyeing the high-profile Georgia race (and the circumstances that led to it) are inevitably asking the question: Should I jump in or should I jump ship?\n\n\u201cYou will see more and more Republicans who are having private conversations \u2014 and more who will say it publicly \u2014 about their concerns over the administration and the direction of the presidency,\u201d said Chip Lake, a Republican consultant in Georgia. \u201cA lot of members are going to start thinking: Do I want to deal with this, or would I rather retire and relax?\u201d\n\nSeveral Democrats have already cited the Georgia race as inspiration for their own campaigns, including Andy Kim, a former Obama administration official who launched a campaign against Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur on Monday in a tricky New Jersey district.\n\n\u201cWhen I see Jon Ossoff is able to raise millions in a matter of months and weeks, that makes me feel like, if I find the right message and I\u2019m the candidate I hope to be, I\u2019m someone who can take on someone as rich as MacArthur,\u201d Kim said. \u201cPeople are fired up, and we need to harness that energy.\u201d\n\nSpecial elections are still special\n\nWin or lose, the Georgia special election is a snapshot of a single Southern suburban district, 18 months away from 2018. If Democrats win, it\u2019s not a guarantee they will steal Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s gavel. If Republicans win, it won\u2019t change the circumstances that made this previously unlikely district competitive.\n\n\u201cWe know what we\u2019re up against in 2018,\u201d Lake said, adding that Republicans \u201chave our work cut out for us.\u201d\n\nA loss for Ossoff could puncture the Democratic enthusiasm, but the anti-Trump fervor that fueled the financial machine behind Ossoff won\u2019t go away, according to Democratic supporters on the ground in Georgia.\n\n\u201cPeople will find another candidate to latch on to,\u201d said Donna Aranson, a 66-year-old preschool administrator and an Ossoff supporter. \u201cOnce this is over, I\u2019ll just find the next candidate who I want to support. Win or lose, this isn\u2019t going away. Ossoff created a movement.\u201d\n\nThe other special election\n\nGeorgia isn\u2019t the only state with a special House election Tuesday. Republican Ralph Norman and Democrat Archie Parnell are facing off in South Carolina\u2019s 5th District, which was left open by another Trump appointee, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.\n\nHowever, Norman is a heavy favorite in a more Republican-friendly district. Trump won the district with 57 percent of the vote in 2016; crucially, he even improved on Mitt Romney\u2019s share there.",
