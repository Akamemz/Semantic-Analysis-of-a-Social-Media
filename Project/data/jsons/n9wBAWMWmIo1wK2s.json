REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his Republican allies have attacked the idea of expanding mail balloting, arguing it is vulnerable to fraud and openly worrying that easier voting would hurt their party\u2019s chances in November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights groups say it is a way to protect voters from the deadly virus, and that a failure to guarantee that option amid a pandemic will disenfranchise millions of Americans, especially the poor and African Americans who are deemed more vulnerable to the virus and who tend to vote Democratic.\n\nLast week\u2019s turbulent Wisconsin elections, which went ahead after Republicans blocked Democratic efforts to delay in-person voting and expand absentee balloting, illustrated the partisan divide - and the mounting urgency to find a solution before the Nov. 3 U.S. election.\n\nHere are key issues surrounding the vote-by-mail debate.\n\nWHAT\u2019S BEHIND REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION?\n\nRepublicans say voting by mail is more susceptible to fraud since voters do not have to appear in person at a polling place.\n\n\u201cMail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country because they\u2019re cheaters. They go and collect them. They\u2019re fraudulent in many cases,\u201d Trump told a recent coronavirus briefing, without providing evidence. He acknowledged he cast an absentee ballot by mail last month in Florida\u2019s Republican primary.\n\nBut Trump also voiced what Democrats believe is the prime motivation for opposing vote by mail: It will lead to a higher turnout that hurts Republican candidates.\n\nTrump told Fox News a shift to making voting easier would mean \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d\n\nTrevor Potter, a Republican former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who founded the Washington-based Campaign Legal Center, said Trump\u2019s reaction was puzzling since Republicans often do well in mail-in balloting.\n\n\u201cPolls show older Americans, those thought to be most vulnerable to the virus, are more likely to support President Trump than other voters,\u201d Potter said, adding conservative Utah is one of five states that has gone to all-mail voting with little sign of fraud.\n\nIS FRAUD REALLY A CONCERN?\n\nA series of academic, government and news investigations over the years have found little evidence of election fraud of any kind. Utah and four other states that vote entirely by mail - Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Colorado - have reported little fraud.\n\nTrump, who has often said without evidence that millions voted illegally in 2016, formed a commission after the campaign to investigate. It disbanded in January 2018 without finding any evidence to back up his allegations.\n\nElection experts say there have been scattered incidents of people collecting and manipulating absentee ballots in a process known as \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d\n\nThe most recent example came in a 2018 North Carolina congressional race, the outcome of which was overturned when it was determined an operative gathered ballots for the Republican candidate.\n\nARGUMENTS FOR VOTING BY MAIL?\n\nMore than a dozen states already have postponed primaries or expanded vote by mail to avoid forcing residents to go to crowded polling places.\n\nVote by mail is hardly a novelty. A report by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission says the process was used by about one-quarter of all voters in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nAlong with the five states that vote entirely by mail, 28 states will allow voters to request a mail ballot without any excuse in November, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n\u201cWe are not reinventing the wheel here. This is upscaling what is already taking place,\u201d U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, co-sponsor with fellow Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of a bill to expand vote by mail and early voting to all states, told reporters last week.\n\nWHAT ARE THE HURDLES?\n\nThere are still 17 states such as Texas, New York and Louisiana that would need to change their policies to guarantee that everyone who wants to vote by mail in November can, the Brennan Center said.\n\nIt will be expensive. The Brennan Center estimated the cost of ensuring that vote by mail was available for all voters could be up to $1.4 billion, with postage alone costing up to $600 million.\n\nEven advocates of vote by mail say states would need to keep the option of in-person voting, for voters with disabilities, those who need language access assistance or do not have regular mail access.\n\nWHAT ARE THE KEY LEGAL BATTLES?\n\nDemocratic and Republican-aligned groups across the country are already fighting in federal and state courts over whether and how to expand access to mail-in voting.\n\nOn March 30, 27 New Mexico county clerks petitioned the state Supreme Court to conduct their June 2 primary almost entirely by mail and allow all voters to be mailed an absentee ballot.
