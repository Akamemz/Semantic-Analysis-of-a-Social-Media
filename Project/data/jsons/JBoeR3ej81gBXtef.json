If today \u2019 s media had been around back then , he said , \u201c The L.A. riots would 've been depicted as partisan . It would 've been a left-right thing . The cops would 've been the good guys no matter what ; people \u2014 obviously the looters and rioters are separate \u2014 but anyone who raised questions about the beating would 've been agitators , probably would 've been ACORN or were communists or things like that . \u201d\nFast forwarding to the Obama era , Boehlert continued , \u201c You \u2019 ve got a right-wing media that I think kind of tipped its hand with the Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin case . For the first few weeks there was very little coverage , very little passion on Fox News or the right-wing blogs about that story. \u201d Similar points were made at the time by Judd Legum at Think Progress , Simon Owens at the Moderate Voice , and Boehlert himself at Media Matters .\n\u201c Rich Lowry actually wrote a piece saying Al Sharpton was right , someone should be indicted for that murder , \u201d Boehlert continued \u2014 a point we \u2019 ll return to in a moment . \u201c Then Obama addressed it , and once Obama enters the conversation about race , you know , they went from zero to a hundred ... they decided that the story was partisan , and that supporting Trayvon Martin was the Democratic position , supporting the guy who killed an unarmed teen was the Republican conservative position , and so they set up the markers , and went for it . And the way they did that was they smeared a dead teenager for 16 months until Zimmerman 's acquittal . \u201d\nTo understand the process of shaping the polarized narrative , it \u2019 s helpful to go back to the moment before , to Lowry \u2019 s Sharpton column . It was an odd mix of name-calling and common sense . Al Sharpton was a \u201c longtime provocateur '' and a \u201c perpetually aggrieved , shamelessly exploitative publicity hound , \u201d but like a stopped clock , \u201c he occasionally will be right , \u201d and this is one of those occasions , Lowry argued . Zimmerman , he said , should be arrested and tried :\nWe may never know what exactly happened in the altercation . We do know this : Through stupendous errors in judgment , Zimmerman brought about an utterly unnecessary confrontation and then \u2014 in the most favorable interpretation of the facts for him \u2014 shot Martin when he began to lose a fistfight to him .\nLowry took note of Florida \u2019 s \u201c stand your ground \u201d law , but blithely downplayed the complexities of how it actually works in practice ( \u201c It is one of the reasons that the police didn \u2019 t press charges against Zimmerman , \u201d he admitted ) and invoked its pure-as-the-driven-snow transcendent spirit :\nBut the law is not meant to be a warrant for aggressive vigilantism . It was Martin , chased by a stranger who wasn \u2019 t an officer of the law , who had more reason to feel threatened and \u201c stand his ground \u201d than Zimmerman .\nThe jumbled mix of attitudes displayed in this piece might even be stable in some political environments \u2014 but not ours . As Alex Pareene noted shortly afterward ( `` Why Rush Limbaugh and the Right Turned On Trayvon Martin '' ) , the same day Lowry 's column appeared everything changed :\nOn March 23 , two things happened : Buffoon Geraldo Rivera made his infamous remarks on the role Martin \u2019 s style of dress played in his death \u2014 a dumb point dumbly made \u2014 and President Obama told the press : \u201c My main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin . You know , if I had a son , he \u2019 d look like Trayvon. \u201d It was basically on this day that everything went to hell . The story of an unarmed teenager shot dead while walking home and a police force that decided that didn \u2019 t constitute a crime suddenly became a partisan issue with numerous points of contention .\nJust to be clear , what Obama said was `` totally innocuous , '' as libertarian-leaning commentator Josh Barro noted at the time ( \u201c Trayvon Martin and the Right 's Race Problem \u201d ) . Obama was responding to a press conference question , and Barro saw the right \u2019 s reaction as troubling . He cited the examples of Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh , then said :\nThe claim running through these objections is that black Americans can not have any special concerns in need of airing . Many of the issues raised in the Trayvon Martin case\u2014was Trayvon Martin singled out for suspicion because he was black ? Did race influence the Sanford police \u2019 s handling of the case ? What is the burden of profiling on young black men ? \u2014are therefore off limits .\nBarro went on to say that \u201c Conservatives , almost universally , feel like they get a bad rap on race , \u201d that they \u201c catch heat \u201d when they make a wide range of arguments that Barro clearly feels have some merit . But then he said :\nWhy do conservatives catch such heat ? It \u2019 s probably because there is still so much racism on the Right to go alongside valid arguments on issues relating to race and ethnicity . Conservatives so often get unfairly pounded on race because , so often , conservatives get fairly pounded on race .\nAnd to clarify what he had in mind , Barro went on to the topic of birtherism , about which he concluded :\nRepublican rejections of Birtherism tend to focus on the issue being \u201c a distraction , \u201d as RNC Chairman Reince Preibus puts it , rather than pointedly noting that it is a nutty , racist conspiracy theory . There has been a clear strategic calculation here among Republican elites . Better to leverage or at least accept the racism of much of the Republican base than try to clean it up .\nBarro still seems to identify as a Republican , so that \u2019 s going pretty far . But almost 50 years after Nixon first launched his \u201c Southern Strategy , \u201d it \u2019 s a bit late to start worrying . More to the point , given the extent of GOP birtherism , sometimes it feels like if Republican elites cleaned up the racism in their base , they wouldn \u2019 t have a base at all .\nTheir only recourse is to insist that it \u2019 s not really racism , because folks like Al Sharpton and Barack Obama are the \u201c real racists \u201d \u2014 you know , folks who notice race and say something about it .\nThis was a point made by Kevin Drum the next day ( \u201c The Conservative Agenda in the Trayvon Martin Case \u201d ) . Drum first noted that \u201c A week ago , the worst I could say about right-wing reaction to the Martin case was that conservatives were studiously ignoring it , \u201d but that things had suddenly changed . It wasn \u2019 t surprising that conservatives had been silent , he noted , as there was no obvious conservative principle at stake in the shooting of Trayvon Martin :\nThere 's no special conservative principle at stake that says neighborhood watch captains should be able to shoot anyone who looks suspicious . There 's no special conservative principle at stake that says local police forces should barely even pretend to investigate the circumstances of a shooting . There 's no special conservative principle at stake that says young black men should n't wear hoodies .\nAnd yet , he noted \u201c as Dave Weigel points out today , the conservative media is now defending the shooter , George Zimmerman , with an almost messianic zeal , \u201d most notably working itself up into a frenzy over a faked \u2014 even debunked \u2014 photograph of Trayvon as gangsta . So , clearly there must be some principle at stake , but what is it ? Drum then quotes from an L.A. Times Op-Ed by Jonah Goldberg , explaining that we should n't care about Martin \u2019 s death because it was \u201c a statistical outlier \u201d \u2014 more blacks are killed by blacks than by any other race . And this brings Drum an epiphany :\nQuite so . And that , it turns out , is the conservative principle that 's actually at stake here : convincing us all that traditional racism no longer really exists ( just in `` pockets , '' says Goldberg ) and that it 's whites who are the real racial victims in today 's America .\nAlex Pareene \u2019 s piece , mentioned above , had a more elaborate analysis , citing four reasons that Martin \u2019 s killing had become a left-right issue : 1 ) Movement conservatism \u2019 s denial of racism ( corollary : \u201c accusations of racism are the new racism , and said accusations are invariably politically motivated \u201d ) . 2 ) President Obama is extremely polarizing . 3 ) The killing was already political , given the role of Florida \u2019 s \u201c stand your ground \u201d law . ( \u201c Part of the frantic defense of Zimmerman is an attempt to ensure that liberals never , ever go back to the gun control advocacy they essentially gave up on after the 1990s. \u201d ) 4 ) Racism . The plain ole gut-level kind ( \u201c the sincere belief that if a black kid got shot , he probably had it coming \u201d ) .\nOf course , you don \u2019 t have to dig too deeply into ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) to find racism there as well . But the story here only begins with recognizing the presence of racism ; it \u2019 s much more about how racism changes , adapts , morphs , interacts with other issues and concerns , and , in the end , continues the age-old tradition of justifying the extra-legal execution of arbitrary victims `` who just happen to be black . ''\nAn example from now-distant history may be helpful here . During slavery , it was commonly propounded that the whites were both smarter and stronger than blacks . There were even faux concerns that if slavery were abolished , the black race would die out , unable to survive on its own . Once slavery ended , however , things changed . The `` happy docile slave stereotype '' ( there were always multiple variants ) was replaced by the predator/rapist , whose purported presence served to justify wave upon wave of lynching epidemics .\nWhat these examples show is how fluid racist ideologies can be under pressure , and yet still fulfill their same basic function of justifying and naturalizing racially stratified outcomes . The book `` Social Dominance : An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression '' explains how stratified societies maintain themselves with a mixture of hierarchy-enhancing and hierarchy-attenuating ideas , values and \u201c legitimating myths , \u201d which can vary over time , but still continued to produce stratified outcomes provided newer legitimating myths emerge to support hierarchy , as the older ones fall out of favor .\nIn America as a whole , perhaps the most useful framework for understanding this process in the so-called post-civil rights era is Eduardo Bonilla-Silva \u2019 s concept of \u201c colorblind racism , \u201d as explained in his 2003 book , `` Racism Without Racists : Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States . '' While the idea of a \u201c colorblind \u201d social order was , in the 19th century , a relatively radical , emancipatory idea , more recently the notion has been turned upside down , with the claim that we are already colorblind , except , perhaps , for those who still see racial injustices . The concept of \u201c colorblind racism \u201d neatly captures what \u2019 s involved in this shell game .\n`` The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information , '' Bonilla-Silva explained , and he identified four such frames at the heart of colorblind racism : 1 ) Abstract Liberalism , using ideas associated with political liberalism ( such as `` equal opportunity , '' the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy ) and economic liberalism ( choice , individualism ) \u2014 in an abstract manner to explain racial matters . 2 ) Naturalization ( \u201c That \u2019 s just how things are. \u201d ) 3 ) Cultural Racism ( arguments like `` Mexicans don \u2019 t put much emphasis on education '' or `` Blacks have too many babies '' to explain the condition of minorities . ) 4 ) Minimization of Racism , which simultaneously acknowledges and dismisses persistent racism ( `` It 's better now than in the past '' or `` There is discrimination , but there are plenty of jobs out there ) .\nWith this framework as background , it \u2019 s not hard to understand the evolution of even more pernicious extremist variants in the right-wing media , which Boehlert sketched out . It began with Andrew Breitbart and his website announcing that \u201c basically racism had been eradicated , and that anyone who talked about the topic was therefore a racist , \u201d especially \u201c civil rights activists and civil libertarians \u2026 because by raising questions , or talking about it , or discussing it , they were trying to rip the country apart , because the country is already solved racism . \u201d\nThat 's like Glenn [ Beck ] that went on Fox News and called the president of the United States a racist , because he dared to discuss it in the wake of the Henry Louis Gates arrest in Cambridge . So that 's why he was denounced as having \u2018 a hatred of white people . Why ? Because he talked about race . \u201d\nOf course , the framework of colorblind racism also explains the persistence of racial stereotyping , albeit in a \u201c cultural \u201d framework . But the right-wing media takes this aspect to extremes as well , which accounts for another , contradictory tendency : the persistence of \u201c increasingly race-baiting rhetoric , \u201d including all manner of things that Hannity , Limbaugh and Beck have been saying about Obama since his inauguration . \u201c This is some of the most rancid , insulting kind of gutter rhetoric you could imagine , \u201d Boehlert said. \u201d But the cone that they 've tried to protect themselves in is that the other people are the racists . It 's very weird . I guess said , it 's a lot of weird projecting going on . \u201d\nWhile the development of colorblind racism as Bonila-Silva describes it took place over decades , the nastier variants in the right-wing media developed much more rapidly , spurred on in part by Obama \u2019 s election . They have now burst forth in multiple forms , one of which is the automatic demonization of any black victim , and the matching valorization of whoever killed or injured that victim . Of course , the specific details of any given case are not always so accommodating to the pre-determined colorblind racist script . As a result , in the killings of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown , we \u2019 ve strikingly similar false claims about both victims , as well as the men who killed them , and some of those claims have persisted quite powerfully , despite all evidence to the contrary .\nWhile we \u2019 ve seen some of those attitudes most brazenly expressed on the Darren Wilson Gofundme site , we see more subtle echoes reflected in statements of support that are carefully crafted to conform to `` all-American '' norms , such as calls for due process \u2014 which Michael Brown , naturally , did not get , and which would not be threatened by treating Wilson like any other murder suspect .\nThis reflects a broader phenomenon , the persistent power of misinformation , which an inter-disciplinary collection of researchers has been studying for some years now . Most recently , I wrote about one study of misinformation in the context of three initiatives on Washington state \u2019 s 2006 ballot . The issues involved were much less charged than the murder of an unarmed black teenager , but all the better , it occurred to me . It may be easier to anecdotally recognize extremely charged distortions in a rapidly shifting framework of rationalizations ( unless you \u2019 re a Fox News devotee ) , but as a matter of scientific methodology , it \u2019 s easier to study less-charged distortions in more stable issue areas .\nSo , did someone with hands-on experience studying those less-charged distortions see similar issues at play , as I did ? I decided to ask Justin Reedy , principle co-author of the Washington state study . \u201c Just anecdotally , I 've seen some things that support both of the phenomena that we think might be happening with misperception : shoddy information in the media , and spontaneous creation of \u2018 facts \u2019 or ideas that are in keeping with one 's values , \u201d Reedy told me .\nIt \u2019 s one of several important open questions in the field just how much distortion wells up from below and how much trickles down from above , and there \u2019 s no reason why the proportions should be either similar or stable across different domains , especially in times of dramatic flux , which are particularly challenging to study . But one can \u2019 t help noticing how top-down and bottom-up influences can get jumbled together , as when Fox \u2019 s Geraldo Rivera speculates on how white jurors will respond at trial :\nRIVERA : The white jurors will look at that convenience store surveillance tape . They will see Michael Brown menacing that clerk . The white jurors will put themselves in the shoes of that clerk . They 'll say , of course the officer responded the way he did . He was menaced by a 6-foot 4-inch , 300-pound kid , 10 minutes fresh from a strong-armed robbery . The officer was defending himself . The white jurors will put themselves in the white officer 's place . The black jurors will see Michael Brown , despite his flaws , as the surrogate for every black youngster ever shot . [ Fox News , `` Outnumbered '' ]\nRivera is purporting to present a \u201c balanced \u201d picture : what white jurors will see vs. what black jurors will . And it \u2019 s quite true that jurors tend to have racially informed perspectives . But what \u2019 s not true is that the surveillance tape had anything to do with the shooting , or that it should play any role in the trial . Hence , virtually all of Rivera \u2019 s speculation about how white jurors would think is fatally tainted . On the other hand , the black jurors are presented as intentionally ignoring evidence ; \u201c despite his flaws \u201d apparently refers to the surveillance tape , which is legally irrelevant and has no place in a murder trial . Such is the false balance that Rivera presents . It does not take any sort of leap to view Rivera \u2019 s performance as providing instruction and guidance , as well as encouragement , for how white jurors should act , in order to legalize modern-day lynchings .\nPledging to uncover the `` truth '' about the shooting victim and determined to prove definitively that anti-black racism does n't exists in America ( it 's a political tool used by liberals , Republican press allies insist ) , many in the right-wing media have dropped any pretense of mourning Martin 's death and set out to show how he probably deserved it .\nHe was certainly correct to focus attention on dichotomization ( what psychologists call \u201c splitting \u201d ) , which links Martin \u2019 s alleged victim-worthiness with Zimmerman \u2019 s innocence , if not heroism . Naturally , the very act of \u201c proving \u201d that Martin had it coming was itself a classic form of racist behavior . The belief that such \u201c proof \u201d would \u201c prove \u201d that racism doesn \u2019 t exist is itself only the latest twist in a very old story of how racism rationalizes itself .\nThe question now is how much both sides of this dichotomized narrative will be allowed to advance unchallenged , and more important , whether we will be able to bring new narratives into the discussion . Allowing that old dichotomized narrative to advance means opening the way for a new era of lynching , at the hands of \u201c heroes \u201d like George Zimmerman , Darren Wilson and countless others like them \u2014 despite the incredible proliferation of social media and monitoring devices that should , in theory , help empower us with unprecedented knowledge , transparency and capacity for collective action .\nBut the tools we have at hand are only as good as the hearts and minds that use them . And our hearts and minds are only as good as our commitment to learn hard truths from our history , rather than blindly repeat it .",

The story of an unarmed teenager shot dead while walking home and a police force that decided that didn\u2019t constitute a crime suddenly became a partisan issue with numerous points of contention.\n\nJust to be clear, what Obama said was \"totally innocuous,\" as libertarian-leaning commentator Josh Barro noted at the time (\u201cTrayvon Martin and the Right's Race Problem\u201d). Obama was responding to a press conference question, and Barro saw the right\u2019s reaction as troubling. He cited the examples of Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh, then said:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe claim running through these objections is that black Americans cannot have any special concerns in need of airing. Many of the issues raised in the Trayvon Martin case\u2014was Trayvon Martin singled out for suspicion because he was black? Did race influence the Sanford police\u2019s handling of the case? What is the burden of profiling on young black men?\u2014are therefore off limits.\n\nBarro went on to say that \u201cConservatives, almost universally, feel like they get a bad rap on race,\u201d that they \u201ccatch heat\u201d when they make a wide range of arguments that Barro clearly feels have some merit. But then he said:\n\nWhy do conservatives catch such heat? It\u2019s probably because there is still so much racism on the Right to go alongside valid arguments on issues relating to race and ethnicity. Conservatives so often get unfairly pounded on race because, so often, conservatives get fairly pounded on race.\n\nAnd to clarify what he had in mind, Barro went on to the topic of birtherism, about which he concluded:\n\nRepublican rejections of Birtherism tend to focus on the issue being \u201ca distraction,\u201d as RNC Chairman Reince Preibus puts it, rather than pointedly noting that it is a nutty, racist conspiracy theory. There has been a clear strategic calculation here among Republican elites. Better to leverage or at least accept the racism of much of the Republican base than try to clean it up.\n\nBarro still seems to identify as a Republican, so that\u2019s going pretty far. But almost 50 years after Nixon first launched his \u201cSouthern Strategy,\u201d it\u2019s a bit late to start worrying. More to the point, given the extent of GOP birtherism, sometimes it feels like if Republican elites cleaned up the racism in their base, they wouldn\u2019t have a base at all.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTheir only recourse is to insist that it\u2019s not really racism, because folks like Al Sharpton and Barack Obama are the \u201creal racists\u201d \u2014 you know, folks who notice race and say something about it.\n\nThis was a point made by Kevin Drum the next day (\u201cThe Conservative Agenda in the Trayvon Martin Case\u201d). Drum first noted that \u201cA week ago, the worst I could say about right-wing reaction to the Martin case was that conservatives were studiously ignoring it,\u201d but that things had suddenly changed. It wasn\u2019t surprising that conservatives had been silent, he noted, as there was no obvious conservative principle at stake in the shooting of Trayvon Martin:\n\nThere's no special conservative principle at stake that says neighborhood watch captains should be able to shoot anyone who looks suspicious. There's no special conservative principle at stake that says local police forces should barely even pretend to investigate the circumstances of a shooting. There's no special conservative principle at stake that says young black men shouldn't wear hoodies.\n\nAnd yet, he noted \u201cas Dave Weigel points out today, the conservative media is now defending the shooter, George Zimmerman, with an almost messianic zeal,\u201d most notably working itself up into a frenzy over a faked \u2014 even debunked \u2014 photograph of Trayvon as gangsta. So, clearly there must be some principle at stake, but what is it? Drum then quotes from an L.A. Times Op-Ed by Jonah Goldberg, explaining that we shouldn't care about Martin\u2019s death because it was \u201ca statistical outlier\u201d \u2014 more blacks are killed by blacks than by any other race. And this brings Drum an epiphany:\n\nQuite so. And that, it turns out, is the conservative principle that's actually at stake here: convincing us all that traditional racism no longer really exists (just in \"pockets,\" says Goldberg) and that it's whites who are the real racial victims in today's America.\n\nAlex Pareene\u2019s piece, mentioned above, had a more elaborate analysis, citing four reasons that Martin\u2019s killing had become a left-right issue: 1) Movement conservatism\u2019s denial of racism (corollary: \u201caccusations of racism are the new racism, and said accusations are invariably politically motivated\u201d). 2) President Obama is extremely polarizing. 3) The killing was already political, given the role of Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d law. (\u201cPart of the frantic defense of Zimmerman is an attempt to ensure that liberals never, ever go back to the gun control advocacy they essentially gave up on after the 1990s.\u201d) 4) Racism. The plain ole gut-level kind (\u201cthe sincere belief that if a black kid got shot, he probably had it coming\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t have to dig too deeply into (2) and (3) to find racism there as well. But the story here only begins with recognizing the presence of racism; it\u2019s much more about how racism changes, adapts, morphs, interacts with other issues and concerns, and, in the end, continues the age-old tradition of justifying the extra-legal execution of arbitrary victims \"who just happen to be black.\"\n\nAn example from now-distant history may be helpful here. During slavery, it was commonly propounded that the whites were both smarter and stronger than blacks. There were even faux concerns that if slavery were abolished, the black race would die out, unable to survive on its own. Once slavery ended, however, things changed. The \"happy docile slave stereotype\" (there were always multiple variants) was replaced by the predator/rapist, whose purported presence served to justify wave upon wave of lynching epidemics.\n\nWhat these examples show is how fluid racist ideologies can be under pressure, and yet still fulfill their same basic function of justifying and naturalizing racially stratified outcomes. The book \"Social Dominance: An Intergroup Theory of Social Hierarchy and Oppression\" explains how stratified societies maintain themselves with a mixture of hierarchy-enhancing and hierarchy-attenuating ideas, values and \u201clegitimating myths,\u201d which can vary over time, but still continued to produce stratified outcomes provided newer legitimating myths emerge to support hierarchy, as the older ones fall out of favor.\n\nIn America as a whole, perhaps the most useful framework for understanding this process in the so-called post-civil rights era is Eduardo Bonilla-Silva\u2019s concept of \u201ccolorblind racism,\u201d as explained in his 2003 book, \"Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States.\" While the idea of a \u201ccolorblind\u201d social order was, in the 19th century, a relatively radical, emancipatory idea, more recently the notion has been turned upside down, with the claim that we are already colorblind, except, perhaps, for those who still see racial injustices. The concept of \u201ccolorblind racism\u201d neatly captures what\u2019s involved in this shell game.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\"The central component of any dominant racial ideology is its frames or set paths for interpreting information,\" Bonilla-Silva explained, and he identified four such frames at the heart of colorblind racism: 1) Abstract Liberalism, using ideas associated with political liberalism (such as \"equal opportunity,\" the idea that force should not be used to achieve social policy) and economic liberalism (choice, individualism) \u2014 in an abstract manner to explain racial matters. 2) Naturalization (\u201cThat\u2019s just how things are.\u201d) 3) Cultural Racism (arguments like \"Mexicans don\u2019t put much emphasis on education\" or \"Blacks have too many babies\" to explain the condition of minorities.) 4) Minimization of Racism, which simultaneously acknowledges and dismisses persistent racism (\"It's better now than in the past\" or \"There is discrimination, but there are plenty of jobs out there).\n\nWith this framework as background, it\u2019s not hard to understand the evolution of even more pernicious extremist variants in the right-wing media, which Boehlert sketched out. It began with Andrew Breitbart and his website announcing that \u201cbasically racism had been eradicated, and that anyone who talked about the topic was therefore a racist,\u201d especially \u201ccivil rights activists and civil libertarians \u2026 because by raising questions, or talking about it, or discussing it, they were trying to rip the country apart, because the country is already solved racism.\u201d\n\nThus, the allegation is that simply talking about race in America makes you a racist. It is, as Boehlert called it, \u201ca very odd brand of projection\u201d that\u2019s \u201cvery weird and complicated,\u201d but that\u2019s where the roles of endless repetition and cognitive closure come in. They naturalize and normalize what would otherwise clearly be both arbitrary and bizarre. After years in development, the result can be quite stunning, as Boehlert went on to note:\n\nThat's like Glenn [Beck] that went on Fox News and called the president of the United States a racist, because he dared to discuss it in the wake of the Henry Louis Gates arrest in Cambridge. So that's why he was denounced as having \u2018a hatred of white people. Why? Because he talked about race.\u201d\n\nOf course, the framework of colorblind racism also explains the persistence of racial stereotyping, albeit in a \u201ccultural\u201d framework. But the right-wing media takes this aspect to extremes as well, which accounts for another, contradictory tendency: the persistence of \u201cincreasingly race-baiting rhetoric,\u201d including all manner of things that Hannity, Limbaugh and Beck have been saying about Obama since his inauguration. \u201cThis is some of the most rancid, insulting kind of gutter rhetoric you could imagine,\u201d Boehlert said.\u201d But the cone that they've tried to protect themselves in is that the other people are the racists. It's very weird. I guess said, it's a lot of weird projecting going on.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nWhile the development of colorblind racism as Bonila-Silva describes it took place over decades, the nastier variants in the right-wing media developed much more rapidly, spurred on in part by Obama\u2019s election. They have now burst forth in multiple forms, one of which is the automatic demonization of any black victim, and the matching valorization of whoever killed or injured that victim. Of course, the specific details of any given case are not always so accommodating to the pre-determined colorblind racist script. As a result, in the killings of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, we\u2019ve strikingly similar false claims about both victims, as well as the men who killed them, and some of those claims have persisted quite powerfully, despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen some of those attitudes most brazenly expressed on the Darren Wilson Gofundme site, we see more subtle echoes reflected in statements of support that are carefully crafted to conform to \"all-American\" norms, such as calls for due process \u2014 which Michael Brown, naturally, did not get, and which would not be threatened by treating Wilson like any other murder suspect.\n\nThis reflects a broader phenomenon, the persistent power of misinformation, which an inter-disciplinary collection of researchers has been studying for some years now. Most recently, I wrote about one study of misinformation in the context of three initiatives on Washington state\u2019s 2006 ballot. The issues involved were much less charged than the murder of an unarmed black teenager, but all the better, it occurred to me. It may be easier to anecdotally recognize extremely charged distortions in a rapidly shifting framework of rationalizations (unless you\u2019re a Fox News devotee), but as a matter of scientific methodology, it\u2019s easier to study less-charged distortions in more stable issue areas.\n\nSo, did someone with hands-on experience studying those less-charged distortions see similar issues at play, as I did? I decided to ask Justin Reedy, principle co-author of the Washington state study. \u201cJust anecdotally, I've seen some things that support both of the phenomena that we think might be happening with misperception: shoddy information in the media, and spontaneous creation of \u2018facts\u2019 or ideas that are in keeping with one's values,\u201d Reedy told me.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIt\u2019s one of several important open questions in the field just how much distortion wells up from below and how much trickles down from above, and there\u2019s no reason why the proportions should be either similar or stable across different domains, especially in times of dramatic flux, which are particularly challenging to study. But one can\u2019t help noticing how top-down and bottom-up influences can get jumbled together, as when Fox\u2019s Geraldo Rivera speculates on how white jurors will respond at trial:\n\nRIVERA: The white jurors will look at that convenience store surveillance tape. They will see Michael Brown menacing that clerk. The white jurors will put themselves in the shoes of that clerk. They'll say, of course the officer responded the way he did. He was menaced by a 6-foot 4-inch, 300-pound kid, 10 minutes fresh from a strong-armed robbery. The officer was defending himself. The white jurors will put themselves in the white officer's place. The black jurors will see Michael Brown, despite his flaws, as the surrogate for every black youngster ever shot. [Fox News, \"Outnumbered\"]\n\nRivera is purporting to present a \u201cbalanced\u201d picture: what white jurors will see vs. what black jurors will. And it\u2019s quite true that jurors tend to have racially informed perspectives. But what\u2019s not true is that the surveillance tape had anything to do with the shooting, or that it should play any role in the trial. Hence, virtually all of Rivera\u2019s speculation about how white jurors would think is fatally tainted. On the other hand, the black jurors are presented as intentionally ignoring evidence; \u201cdespite his flaws\u201d apparently refers to the surveillance tape, which is legally irrelevant and has no place in a murder trial. Such is the false balance that Rivera presents. It does not take any sort of leap to view Rivera\u2019s performance as providing instruction and guidance, as well as encouragement, for how white jurors should act, in order to legalize modern-day lynchings.\n\nAfter Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal, Boehlert wrote, in a retrospective overview:\n\nPledging to uncover the \"truth\" about the shooting victim and determined to prove definitively that anti-black racism doesn't exists in America (it's a political tool used by liberals, Republican press allies insist), many in the right-wing media have dropped any pretense of mourning Martin's death and set out to show how he probably deserved it.\n\nHe was certainly correct to focus attention on dichotomization (what psychologists call \u201csplitting\u201d), which links Martin\u2019s alleged victim-worthiness with Zimmerman\u2019s innocence, if not heroism. Naturally, the very act of \u201cproving\u201d that Martin had it coming was itself a classic form of racist behavior. The belief that such \u201cproof\u201d would \u201cprove\u201d that racism doesn\u2019t exist is itself only the latest twist in a very old story of how racism rationalizes itself.\n\nThe question now is how much both sides of this dichotomized narrative will be allowed to advance unchallenged, and more important, whether we will be able to bring new narratives into the discussion. Allowing that old dichotomized narrative to advance means opening the way for a new era of lynching, at the hands of \u201cheroes\u201d like George Zimmerman, Darren Wilson and countless others like them \u2014 despite the incredible proliferation of social media and monitoring devices that should, in theory, help empower us with unprecedented knowledge, transparency and capacity for collective action.\n\nBut the tools we have at hand are only as good as the hearts and minds that use them. And our hearts and minds are only as good as our commitment to learn hard truths from our history, rather than blindly repeat it.",
