    "content": "Here , on the streets of Ferguson and St. Louis , you can already feel the rest of the world forgetting . Today , President Obama will hold in Washington a series of Ferguson-related meetings . He will meet with local law enforcement leaders , faith leaders , and focus on working together to \u201c build trust to strengthen neighborhoods across the country. \u201d What he will not do , evidently , is to come to Ferguson , to see the burned-out blocks and feel the city \u2019 s pain . The national media is beginning to depart . The grand jury is literally last week \u2019 s news .\nBut Ferguson is not \u201c over , \u201d because Ferguson never really \u201c began. \u201d Ferguson did not \u201c start \u201d on August 9 th when Darren Wilson approached Michael Brown ; it did not \u201c end \u201d on November 24 th when the grand jury results were announced . As media vacate the smoldering wreckage of West Florissant Avenue , as pundits and politicians talk about \u201c healing \u201d and \u201c closure , \u201d St. Louis is being left to struggle with the same problems it always had . There has been no healing , only deeper wounds . There has been no closure , only a desire to move on . St. Louis wants to move forward , but it is driving blind .\nThis should have been a year of celebration . This is the 250 th anniversary of the founding of St. Louis , and across the metropolitan area , cakes were planted to mark important sites in the region \u2019 s history . Each cake is unique , beautiful , hand-painted by a local artist , often reflecting the landmark on which it lies . All year long , families in St. Louis have gone \u201c caking \u201d , posting pictures of themselves at each site . In late November , a gap-toothed child posed in front of a police barricade , the celebratory cake behind yellow tape and metal bars . That night , her city burned . This is St. Louis \u2019 s reality , 250 years in . This is what St. Louis \u2019 s children will remember .\nFollow the pattern of the cakes , and you will see who is abandoned in St. Louis . You will find cakes in the downtown area , on 19 th-century sites built when St. Louis was proclaimed a \u201c future great city of the world. \u201d You will find cakes in the museums and monuments created for the 1904 World \u2019 s Fair , when people traveled to St. Louis to see society build instead of burn . You will find cakes in the white suburbs , parked at ice cream parlors and children \u2019 s attractions , symbolic of our family-friendly ways . You will find few cakes in the black suburbs that are neither romantic enough for revitalization nor pestigious enough for investment . Civic abandonment is nothing to celebrate .\nSt. Louis was a city built on promise\u2014the promise of the westward expansion , the promise of endless opportunity , the promise of great societal progress .\nBut the promise of St. Louis was one never meant\u2014or kept\u2014for all .
