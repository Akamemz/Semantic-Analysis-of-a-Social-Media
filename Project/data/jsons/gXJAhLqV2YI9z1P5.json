    "content": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson aired a segment on Friday night that showed how a lot of the rhetoric being used by the mainstream media and Democratic Party matches the propaganda that the communist Chinese government is using to deflect blame over the coronavirus outbreak .\nCarlson began the segment by reporting on what he says U.S. government officials have told him about the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China , and by also documenting how China has repeatedly changed its story about what happened .\nLater in the segment , Carlson said , \u201c As of today , says someone in a position to know , there is \u2018 Almost unanimous agreement in the American intelligence gathering agencies that the virus currently destroying much of the world emerged from a lab in Wuhan. \u2019 Almost unanimous . That is a phrase almost never used to describe any conclusion coming out of the Intel Community . \u201d\n\u201c Government officials in this country have believed that for some time now , \u201d Carlson continued . \u201c They \u2019 ve been unable to interest our media or our epidemiologists in writing about it . In recent weeks analysts from the CIA , the NSA , and others have reached staff at The New York Times about the origins of this virus , but the newspaper has still not reported their findings . At the same time , and this may be directly related , China has been waging an unremitting propaganda war on the subject . Chinese officials have tried to squelch all conversations about who might be responsible for this pandemic by inflaming the political sensitivities and race guilt of American elites . \u201d\nWe brought you fresh reporting last night on the question of where the deadly coronavirus pandemic came from . Tonight , we have more . We spent much of the day speaking to highly informed officials in the U.S. Government as well as seasoned specialists on China , and here \u2019 s the picture that emerged from those conversations .\nFirst , many in the intelligence world with experience in China suspected right away that the story the Chinese government was telling about this virus was almost certainly a lie .\nThe first indication of that was the torrent of obvious nonsense coming from official sources in Beijing . Now initially , Chinese sources , you may remember this , claimed the virus had jumped from an obscure scaly animal called a \u201c Pangolin , \u201d which was sold in the Wuhan wet market , but that explanation didn \u2019 t make any sense . Wet markets are seafood markets . Pangolins are mammals . So , for that matter , are bats . So in the face of skepticism at this explanation , the Chinese then blamed Italian armed forces personnel , who it turns out had been near Wuhan a few months before for the military world games \u2013 that \u2019 s an international sporting event . The Italians must have brought the virus to China , the Chinese said .\nWhen the Italian government complained about that , the Chinese shifted the blame to the U.S. military . The American armed services and western tourists must have infected Wuhan , the Chinese said . Meanwhile , as they were saying this , behind-the-scenes Chinese officials were working frantically to destroy relevant evidence of where it actually came from . Doctors and journalists in Wuhan who raised uncomfortable questions about the virus disappeared . Some of them may have been murdered . At one point in January , scientists in Shanghai succeeded in sequencing the DNA from the virus . The information they gathered from that could \u2019 ve been crucial to researchers around the world who were trying to understand the virus and develop vaccines against it . In other words , the rest of us .\nBut the Chinese government ordered that viral sample destroyed and the lab notes from that shredded . The scientists themselves were disciplined for daring to conduct this research , and their lab was shut down . The Chinese government then quarantined the entire city of Wuhan , up to 5 million people fled . But apparently , relatively few of them were allowed to travel to Beijing , the Chinese capital . Instead , they flew to western cities around the world . Now , to most in the United States , reactions to a crisis like this seem grotesque , really unimaginable . But to mandarin speakers who follow China carefully and have for a long time , these were highly familiar moves .\nThe first reflex of the Chinese government is always to lie in order to hide failure and avoid embarrassment . In 2003 , for example , the Chinese government lied about the initial outbreak of SARS , another Coronavirus . In July 2011 , two passenger trains traveling in opposite directions smashed into each other at high speed outside the Chinese city of Wenzhou . The trains collided on a railroad bridge . Four calls derailed and tumbled to the ground below . Within hours , authorities arrived with backhoes , they pushed the passenger cars into a pit , and began covering them with dirt . By some accounts there were still survivors inside at that time , inside the passenger cars . In their initial statements , Chinese officials claimed that a lightning strike had caused that crash . They later conceded under pressure that it was sloppiness and shoddy construction that were to blame . Chinese media meanwhile were ordered to ignore the crash entirely except for \u201c positive news \u201d or \u2026 news issued by authorities .\nThis was the template for China \u2019 s official response to the Wuhan virus . From the early days of the outbreak , Chinese diplomats around the world insisted there was no chance whatsoever the virus had come from a lab . They sometimes insisted this even when no one had asked them , as if they were reading from a script . It soon became very obvious what was going on . English-language academic journals had raised for years questions about the safety standards in Wuhan bio research labs . An article in \u201c Nature \u201d for example from 2017 noted that \u201c Some scientists outside China worry about pathogens escaping from the facility. \u201d Classified State Department cables a year later than voiced the same concerns . Chinese scientists themselves publicly discussed working with extremely dangerous pathogens in Wuhan .\nAs of today , says someone in a position to know , there is \u201c Almost unanimous agreement in the American intelligence gathering agencies that the virus currently destroying much of the world emerged from a lab in Wuhan. \u201d Almost unanimous . That is a phrase almost never used to describe any conclusion coming out of the Intel Community . Government officials in this country have believed that for some time now .

Chinese officials have tried to squelch all conversations about who might be responsible for this pandemic by inflaming the political sensitivities and race guilt of American elites . Watch this clip from early last month as a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry tries to dictate how American press outlets describe the virus .\nAmong the many ironies in what you just heard , even now , even today , the disease is widely referred to in China as the Wuhan virus . Our news outlets , meanwhile , almost always call it COVID-19 . That term does not translate to Chinese . COVID-19 is the name devised by the World Health Organization back in January under influence from Chinese leaders who were anxious to deflect responsibility for it . Once they succeeded in removing any hint of origin from the name of the virus , the Chinese government launched a campaign to tar anyone who mentioned Wuhan as a dangerous racist . \u201c Racism is not the right tool to cover your own incompetence \u201d lectured Chinese state media when President Trump refer to the Wuhan virus . American media parroted that line almost precisely , as no doubt Chinese expected they would .\nFools . But not a major victory for the Chinese government . Media outlets are relatively easy to corrupt , given the relatively low level sophistication of the people who work there . The Chinese government have bolder aims than that . The Chinese instructed their employees and assets in the United States to exert influence on elected officials . For example , according to an informed U.S. government official , \u201c Beijing has instructed diplomats in their consulate in San Francisco to work with American state and local officials , and members of Congress to push back against anyone who gets too far out on blaming China for this. \u201d That is what they are doing , apparently it \u2019 s working . Here \u2019 s Connecticut senator Chris Murphy on CNN earlier this week .\nOther members of Congress voiced similar views , often in eerily similar language . Barbara Lee of California , long considered a strongly pro-China voice , tweeted this to the president , \u201c Diseases don \u2019 t have nationalities . China isn \u2019 t to blame for you fumbling this crisis. \u201d On March 12 , congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles wrote this , \u201c China didn \u2019 t unleash anything . A virus spread as viruses do . Blaming China and insisting on calling this the Wuhan virus , even though every medical expert said not to , is putting people \u2019 s lives in danger . Stop politicizing this and put people first. \u201d Just week before Judy Chu wrote that on March 6 , a man called [ inaudible ] who runs the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles met with the Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti about the American response to Coronavirus . He tweeted about it that day .
