Its goal , after all , is \u201c fighting against evil and trying to restore the palace guard and the Kingship of Christ , \u201d it proclaims in a recent video . In such a fight , it adds , \u201c extreme and fringe \u201d is the only place to be .\nA nondescript brick building here in the Detroit suburbs is where those videos are produced \u2013 the command center of an ultraorthodox Catholic organization that called the recent women \u2019 s marches a \u201c disgusting scene \u201d and argues that the role of the state is only to protect the civil rights of Catholics .\nChurch Militant \u2019 s criticism of Judaism and Islam is such that it is \u201c on the spectrum \u201d of hate groups , according to the Taskforce on Hate and Terrorism in Washington .\nBut this year , its coffers are fuller than ever , says group leader Michael Voris . As Donald Trump made his way toward the White House , the organization doubled its revenue from $ 1 million to $ 2.2 million , marking what Mr. Voris calls \u201c our best year ever . \u201d\n\u201c The enthusiasm level has really taken off in this last year , \u201d he tells the Monitor . \u201c It \u2019 s really off the chart . \u201d\nThe enthusiasm for Church Militant mirrors a shift in hate-related activity since the start of Mr. Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign . Hate-related incidents spiked after his election , though inconsistent reporting made it hard to determine the extent of the trend .\nMore clear has been the rise in the number of hate groups the past two years , with the Southern Poverty Law Center writing on its website that the increase is \u201c in part due to a presidential campaign that flirted heavily with extremist ideas. \u201d The number of anti-Muslim hate groups nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016 , according to SPLC data .\nFor his part , Trump has condemned recent threats against Jewish organizations and has visited and extolled the new National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington . He has said his proposed temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is not based on religion .\nBut his talk of a Muslim ban during the campaign , combined with his broad characterizations of many undocumented immigrants as violent criminals , bears what one scholar calls \u201c a family face resemblance \u201d to ideas supported by hard-right groups . Indeed , a broader surge in hate groups since 2000 has been \u201c driven in part by anger over Latino immigration \u201d and the declining whiteness of the United States , SLPC argues .\nIn that context , experts are watching to see how this rise in energy and organization on the extreme right plays out . The question is whether some Americans are feeling empowered to use the confrontational stance of the Trump administration to radicalize an emotional and existential debate over America \u2019 s fundamental character .\n\u201c What is novel about the current moment is that these groups \u2026 see Trump as someone giving them hope that the state will act on their interests , \u201d says Carolyn Gallaher , a political geographer at American University in Washington and author of \u201c On the Fault Line : Race , Class and the American Patriot Movement . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 ll be interesting to see what happens to memberships in [ far-right ] groups : Will it only get bigger as they feel they now have a conduit to the White House ?
