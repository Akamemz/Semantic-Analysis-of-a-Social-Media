    "content": "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker stunned onlookers and lawmakers during an already-contentious House hearing Friday , when he tried to call time on the Democratic chairman after yet another line of questioning regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia probe .\nThe retort came after Chairman Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , first said he wanted Whitaker to appear for a private deposition after the hearing and went on to ask Whitaker whether he had been \u201c asked to approve any requests or action \u201d for the special counsel .\nWHITAKER WILL TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE PANEL AFTER TENSE BACK-AND-FORTH : NADLER AND DOJ\n\u201c Mr . Chairman , I see that your five minutes is up , so\u2026 \u201d Whitaker replied as the hearing room broke out in gasps . \u201c I am here voluntarily . We have agreed to five-minute rounds . \u201d\nNadler , who even cracked a slight smile at the response , repeated his question , and Whitaker ultimately responded : \u201c I have not interfered in any way with the special counsel \u2019 s investigation . \u201d\nAs it dragged on , the hearing repeatedly gave way to bickering among Whitaker and Democratic lawmakers , and among members of the committee , over whether Whitaker was properly answering questions . At one point , he tussled with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas , when she pressed on whether he \u2019 s appeared before for an oversight hearing .\nWhile the answer , eventually , was that he had not , the congresswoman objected when Whitaker would not answer with a requested \u201c yes or no. \u201d When she asked the chairman if her time had been restored , Whitaker snarked back : \u201c I don \u2019 t know whether your time \u2019 s been restored or not . \u201d\n\u201c Mr . Attorney General , we \u2019 re not joking here , and your humor is not acceptable , \u201d the congresswoman responded .\nThe fiery back and forth follows a dramatic political prelude to the hearing itself , complete with threats by Nadler to subpoena the witness and threats by the DOJ to boycott . Democrats are acutely focused on Whitaker 's oversight of the Mueller probe , in his acting AG status while awaiting confirmation of President Trump 's attorney general pick William Barr .\n\u201c There has been no change in the overall management of the special counsel investigation , \u201d Whitaker testified Friday , saying that he never offered any \u201c promises or commitments \u201d regarding the Mueller or any other investigation .\nNadler pressed Whitaker over whether he had shared information about the investigation with Trump , or any White House officials .\n\u201c I do not intend today to talk about my private conversations , but to answer your question , I did not talk to the president about the status of the investigation , \u201d Whitaker answered . \u201c Consistent with what I \u2019 ve already said , I have not talked about the special counsel \u2019 s investigation with any White House officials . \u201d\nWhitaker did not directly answer several of Nadler \u2019 s other questions , resulting in the chairman requesting that the acting attorney general return to the committee at a later date .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve given you a fair opportunity so that we could avoid this fight in the first place , but you don \u2019 t appear to have done any of that , \u201d Nadler said , referring to Whitaker \u2019 s preparations , while saying , \u201c I do not believe issuing a subpoena here would correct the problem. \u201d Nadler explained that the committee would \u201c attempt to reach an accommodation with the department to receive answers , \u201d so Whitaker can return for \u201c deposition before the committee , under oath . \u201d\nNadler said that , at that point , he expects \u201c clean answers or proper assertion of privilege claimed by the president . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the top Republican on the committee blasted the hearing as a `` dog and pony show .
