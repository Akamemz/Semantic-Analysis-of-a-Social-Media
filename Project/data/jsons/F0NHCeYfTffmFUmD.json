    "content": "On Monday , 11 Jewish community centers across the country were targeted with bomb threats . Outside St. Louis , a Jewish cemetery was desecrated : More than 100 tombstones were overturned and damaged .\n\u201c Enough already , \u201d Karen Aroesty , an Anti-Defamation League local leader , told a Fox news affiliate . \u201c This is where your loved ones come to be safe in perpetuity , and the level of tension in the Jewish community is pretty high . \u201d\nNBC News asked the White House for a statement on the uptick in anti-Semitic activities and the terrorizing of JCCs nationally , as the newest round of threatening calls brings the total number of bomb scares to 67 since the beginning of January . The White House press office issued a statement :\nHatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom . The President has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable .\nAmerica is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance . We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers . # JCC \u2014 Ivanka Trump ( @ IvankaTrump ) February 20 , 2017\nBoth comments were among the most specific statements the White House , or its surrogates , has made to address the rise in anti-Semitic acts , statements , and sentiment that has percolated since the middle of the election .\nThe silence was so profound , ADL \u2019 s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt put out a statement , earlier Monday , underscoring the notable absence of leadership . \u201c We look to our political leaders at all levels to speak out against such threats directed against Jewish institutions , to make it clear that such actions are unacceptable , and to pledge that they will work with law enforcement officials to ensure that those responsible will be apprehended and punished to the full extent of the law , \u201d he said .\nThe White House press office comment may miss that test , even now , in failing to use the words \u201c Jewish , \u201d \u201c Jewish Community Center , \u201d or \u201c anti-Semitism . \u201d\nIndeed , President Donald Trump has been minimally vocal about his positions on the matter . Just last week , he had the chance to use his bully pulpit to reassure Jews who are fearful of rising anti-Semitism in America . He took two chances for targeted messaging to talk , instead , about himself .\nAt two press conferences last week , reporters raised sober questions about Jewish safety in America and the rise of anti-Semitism over the course of the election and beyond . Both were opportunities for a statement of firm condemnation against acts of violence and a moment of empathy : a presidential reassuring hand and an outstretched arm . Both times the questions were deflected , and rerouted , leaving the Jewish community reeling .\nLast Wednesday morning , at a press conference held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israeli journalist Moav Vardi stood up and asked , \u201c Since your election campaign , and even since your victory , we have seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States and I wonder what you have say to the Jewish community of the United States and Israel , and maybe around the world , and ... to those who feel your administration is maybe playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones ? \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s response was surreal . First , he crowed about his electoral victory \u2014 \u201c Well , I just want to say that we are , you know , very honored by the victory that we had I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory we had \u2014 316 Electoral College votes . We were not supposed to crack 220 . You know that , right ? \u201d ( It was so incongruous that a New York Times editorial noted : \u201c It was as if his brain had short-circuited or someone had hit some internal replay button in his brain . \u201d )\nI will say that we are going to have peace in this country . We are going to stop crime in this country . We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that 's going on . There 's a lot of bad things that have been taking place over a long period of time . ... As far as people , Jewish people , so many friends ; a daughter who happens to be here right now ; a son-in-law , and three beautiful grandchildren . I think that you 're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three , four , or eight years . I think a lot of good things are happening . And you 're going to see a lot of love . You 're going to see a lot of love .\nHe did not say , On behalf of my Jewish grandchildren , this White House will stand against anti-Semitism . He did not say , even more simply , No children should live in fear . He merely noted the existence of his Jewish relatives , as though their very presence spoke sufficiently to both of those points .\nThe following day , Trump had a second chance to address the issue .\nDuring a 77-minute meandering press conference on Thursday , Jake Turx , a journalist from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish publication Ami Magazine , stood up and asked a question . After first promising that he wasn \u2019 t accusing Trump himself of being anti-Semitic ( knowing he was a zayde , a grandfather , to Jewish kids ) he then asked :\nWhat we are concerned about and what we haven \u2019 t really heard being addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it . There \u2019 s been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks . There are people committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to \u2014\nBut Turx never got to finish his question . Trump cut him off , and told him to sit down . \u201c See , he said he was going to ask a very simple , easy question , and it 's not , '' the president said , brusquely .\nNot a simple question . Not a fair question . Okay , sit down . I understand the rest of your question . ... So here 's the story , folks . number one : I am the least anti-Semitic person that you 've ever seen in your entire life .\nThe reporter immediately tried to elaborate . The president stopped him again saying :\nQuiet , quiet , quiet . See he lied about \u2014 he was going to get up and ask a very straight , simple question . So , you know , welcome to the world of the media .\nThis is startling . Instead of taking an easy opportunity to reassure concerned American Jews that their president has their back , Trump roughly pushed back at an Orthodox Jewish reporter whose questions weren \u2019 t about what the administration , or the president , was doing negatively , but what it might be doing proactively to address those who are attacking the community .\nFor many Jews , the moment brought home a concern that has rankled for many months . By halfway through 2016 , there was a persistent , palpable , even terrifying , sense within the community that we had suddenly entered into a new era of popular anti-Semitic permissiveness , one where what was once fringe thought and speech had been mainstreamed and magnified by social media .\nThere were tweets that brought in anti-Semitic imagery during the campaign ( a six-pointed Jewish star , superimposed upon a pile of money that was later sworn to be a \u201c sheriff \u2019 s star \u201d ; surrogates who tweeted images of Pepe the frog , a favorite of the self-described alt-right ) .\nThere was , as well , worrisome messaging from the campaign itself , including a final advertisement that used anti-Semitic dog whistles about money , power , and \u201c global special interests. \u201d And there was deep concern about the stories published by Breitbart news , former news home of Steve Bannon , a leading campaign adviser turned White House right-hand man , which didn \u2019 t shy away from speaking negatively about Jews .\nMidway through the campaign , those who disliked journalists \u2019 work on Trump and his campaign began to target Jewish journalists on Twitter . Direct requests to the Republican candidate to condemn the demonization of Jewish journalists yielded nothing .\nOnce in office , it was hardly reassuring that the president \u2019 s message on Holocaust Remembrance Day failed to mention Jewish victims . To many , it felt premeditated .\nAdded together with an uptick in physical threats to Jewish institutions around the country , these two press conference moments were a chance to let Jewish citizens know support from the White House would be robust , and that hate would not be tolerated .\nThe choice to ignore that moment , or miss it , sent a different message entirely .\n\u201c What will it take for Donald Trump to condemn Anti-Semitism , \u201d began an op-ed in the Jewish daily Forward by Kenneth Stern , executive director of the Justus and Karin Rosenberg Foundation , an organization that fights anti-Semitism and hate crimes . He called the president a \u201c serial enabler \u201d of anti-Semitism and white supremacists , and noted the incredible lack of empathy conveyed over the past 48 hours .\n\u201c If the President can \u2019 t empathize with , or even imagine , what it feels like to be a Jewish child rushing out of a [ Jewish community center ] in fear of a bomb , or the Jewish child from Montana whose picture neo-Nazis posted online , maybe he should think about the increasingly hostile environment confronting his beautiful Jewish grandchildren , \u201d wrote Stern . \u201c History teaches that hatred of all types \u2014 perhaps anti-Semitism especially \u2014 grows in a culture where it is tolerated , and not reflexively condemned , by leaders . \u201d\nIn a statement posted to Twitter , American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris plaintively said , \u201c Mr . President , anti-Semitism around the world is on the rise . ... We need the help of the government to combat this cancer . That \u2019 s why questions are being asked at press conferences . ... But if every such question elicits either no substantive response or , mistakenly , is taken personally , then what are people of good will supposed to conclude ? \u201d\nWriting for the Jewish parenting site Kveller , Jordana Horn noted all the president needed to say was , \u201c \u2018 I deplore and condemn anti-Semitism in all forms . Perpetrators of anti-Semitic acts will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. \u2019 \u201d She then offered several reasons for why the statements he did make were \u201c woefully inadequate \u2014 and why their inadequacy should profoundly trouble Americans \u2014 Jewish and otherwise . \u201d\n\u201c The presence of Jews in one \u2019 s administration does not give one carte blanche to ignore anti-Semitism , \u201d she said . The rest of her statement is worth reading in full :\nWe are here , President Trump . We are Jewish Americans . We are not going anywhere . Some of us agree with your policies , others do not . But surely all of us , regardless of our politics , agree that our children should not be targeted for violence because they are Jewish . That our synagogues should not be vandalized with swastikas and broken windows . That Jewish homeowners should not receive threatening letters . That people who say , \u201c Jews should burn in ovens , \u201d are disgusting and should be loudly acknowledged as such . That bomb threats to JCCs are crimes and should be investigated and prosecuted , with the perpetrators brought to justice . Do you agree , Mr. President ? If you do , you need to explicitly say so . You feel free to express your opinions on Twitter about everything from Saturday Night Live to Nordstrom to Meryl Streep . So why , sir , do you stubbornly refuse to say anything condemning anti-Semitic attacks in our country ? Because if you say nothing , I would argue that your silence speaks volumes .\nIn a private Facebook message to me ( reprinted with permission ) , Horn wrote , \u201c I couldn \u2019 t not write . I am the Jewish-American mother of six children : I have an investment in our future as well as our present . \u201d\nStatements ranging from bewildered to angry came as well from Rabbi Jack Moline , president of the Interfaith Alliance , Rabbi Rick Jacobs , of the Union for Reform Judaism , Rabbi Jill Jacobs , of the rabbinical association T \u2019 ruah , and Stosh Cotler , CEO of Bend the Arc .\n\u201c Presidents are supposed to show empathy for their anxious constituents . But when it comes to anti-Semitism , the only person Trump shows empathy for is himself , \u201d wrote columnist Peter Beinart at the Atlantic .\nIn conversation with me , Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) said , simply , \u201c Words have consequences . \u201d\n\u201c Even a simple statement would speak volumes to calm the anxiety . This has become a test , \u201d Greenblatt said . \u201c It \u2019 s not political ... to say prejudice should be stamped out of public square . It is not left and right , only right and wrong . \u201d\nThe reason so many Jews are asking questions about anti-Semitism is that , following the increasingly worrisome rhetoric , associations , and bedfellows of the campaign , there has been a rise in terrifying anti-Semitic incidents since the year began .\nIn January , 60 bomb threats were called in to some 48 Jewish community centers ( JCCs ) across North America . `` I 've been in the business for 20-plus years , and this is unprecedented , '' Paul Goldenberg , national director of the Secure Community Network , told CNN . `` It 's more methodical than meets the eye . ''\nJCCs , it should be noted , are not simply places of gathering or gyms for Zumba classes \u2014 though , of course , none of those should be targeted either . They are also often preschools during the day . That means children under 5 are the ones being evacuated each time a bomb threat is called in .\nAnd the bomb threats are only one piece of the problem .\nAn entire community in Montana has been threatened by actual neo-Nazis , terrifying the Jewish population and putting its rabbi under a microscope . A neo-Nazi march was originally planned for the town of Whitefish , Montana , on Martin Luther King Jr. Day , home to a handful of Jews \u2014 and to the leader of the so-called alt-right Richard Spencer . It was later scuttled .\nAnd during the presidential election , there was a dramatic rise in online harassment of Jewish journalists and Jewish public figures . Says Greenblatt of the ADL , \u201c You had a white supremacist trope winding itself into public dialogue that the campaign did not tamp down when it could have. \u201d He notes that the ADL was dismissed as being \u201c political \u201d for complaining . But what he was seeing was \u201c a tsunami of slander on social media \u2014 photoshopped images and grotesque threats \u2014 all these things were metastasizing . \u201d\nIndeed , the problem grew so large that the ADL issued a report on the matter in October . \u201c At least 800 journalists received anti-Semitic tweets with an estimated reach of 45 million impressions , \u201d the report explained . \u201c There was a significant uptick in anti-Semitic tweets in the second half ( January-July 2016 ) of [ the report \u2019 s ] study period . This correlates to intensifying coverage of the presidential campaign , the candidates and their positions on a range of issues . \u201d\nVandalism , too , has increased , both on public property , and private , Greenblatt notes . And this week a man in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , was arrested for trying to buy a gun . According to the FBI , he had hoped to carry out a \u201c Dylann Roof \u201d style attack on a synagogue to kill Jews . Roof murdered nine worshipers at the historically black Emanuel AME Church in Charleston , South Carolina , in 2016 .\n\u201c I think , empirically \u2014 not opinion , not anecdote , not politics \u2014 something is going on , \u201d says Greenblatt . \u201c There is an uptick in incidents . That is why people are concerned . \u201d\nTrump , though , seems far more concerned with bragging about his electoral victory .",
