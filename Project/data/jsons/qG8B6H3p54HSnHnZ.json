But the way USDA structured the plan means that farmers in Midwestern states like Indiana and Iowa , which backed Trump in 2016 , are on track to receive huge sums of cash ahead of the midterm elections in November , while major produce and nut-growing states , like the Democratic stronghold of California , aren \u2019 t in line to receive big checks from the government .\n\u201c This is strong evidence of [ Trump \u2019 s ] sensitivity to losing support in the Midwest , \u201d Scott Irwin , an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois , said last month when USDA first announced broad outlines of the aid package .\nThe likelihood that Western states are not expected to benefit as much from the aid package , even though they export great quantities of produce , fruits and nuts to China and also have been hammered by retaliatory tariffs , has fueled criticism that the administration is looking to take care of its heartland political base ahead of the election and blunt potential political fallout from its trade policies .\nJohn Block , who served as Agriculture secretary during the Reagan administration and has helped rally support for Trump within the agricultural community , disagreed that politics is at the root of the plan .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an effort to send a message to rural America and agriculture that we do care , \u201d he said . \u201c We know you \u2019 re suffering . \u201d\nUSDA spokesman Tim Murtaugh argued last week that the rollout was connected to farmers \u2019 harvest times and not to any political calendar . For most row crops , farmers harvest in the fall .\nControversy surrounding the aid package does not fall squarely along partisan lines . Many farmers , who tend to vote Republican , have argued that they want the Trump administration to broker new deals to expand overseas markets for agricultural goods , not pay producers for getting walloped in the ongoing trade disputes with China , Canada , Mexico and the European Union .\nAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue , in a statement on Monday , noted that the assistance is intended to stop the bleeding in agriculture and give Trump time to land new trade deals .\n\u201c It \u2019 s important to note all of this could go away tomorrow , if China and the other nations simply correct their behavior , \u201d he said . \u201c But in the meantime , the programs we are announcing today buy time for the president to strike long-lasting trade deals to benefit our entire economy . ''\nFarmers can begin to apply for trade assistance starting on Sept. 4 . Perdue went public with that detail shortly after the administration first announced , in late July , that aid would be made available to farmers , but producers now face a quick turnaround before the application window opens .\nJoseph Glauber , who served as USDA 's chief economist during the Obama administration , said it seems clear that the administration is racing against the political clock with the midterms coming up . \u201c If you \u2019 re going to get money out , you want to do it as quickly as possible for political purposes , \u201d he said .\nPerdue , who was tasked by Trump earlier this year with devising the trade aid program , spent most of the early part of the summer saying publicly that more information on the effects of retaliatory tariffs was needed before the department could determine how rates of assistance would be calculated .\nDoling out billions of dollars in aid to farmers in a matter of months is a complicated task , Glauber and other economists said , particularly because it \u2019 s difficult to isolate price changes that are directly related to tariffs , as opposed to other factors like weather conditions and supply and demand . But because the payments are also slated to be paid out before most crops are done being harvested , questions have been raised about USDA 's method for divvying up funds between growers , given that payments are being based on actual production .\n\u201c These things always sound easier than they turn out to be , \u201d Glauber added .\nBy and large , however , frustration among commodity groups outside of the soy universe stems from the fact that USDA 's assistance will cover only a fraction of anticipated losses .\nThe National Corn Growers Association , during a meeting with USDA and White House officials earlier this month , presented an economic analysis showing that prices have dropped by 44 cents a bushel , amounting to an overall hit of more than $ 6 billion . Under the plan , corn growers will receive payments at a rate of a penny per bushel , amounting to $ 96 million \u2014 the smallest amount of all planned direct payments .\nThe National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S . Wheat Associates also gave officials a rough estimate of losses , showing that prices could fall by 75 cents a bushel , resulting in nearly $ 2.5 billion in losses . Wheat growers will get just over $ 119 million in direct payments .\nUnder the plan , in addition to the direct payments , USDA outlined $ 1.2 billion in purchases of commodities like apples and almonds , to help boost prices . Goods will be redistributed to food banks and other nutrition programs . USDA will also devote $ 200 million to developing foreign markets for U.S. crops , through efforts such as advertising , participation in trade fairs and market research .\nPork is slated to be the largest beneficiary of the buy-ups , with a planned purchase of $ 558 million . Pork , which has been hit by retaliatory tariffs on multiple fronts , also will get the second-highest amount of direct payments , at $ 290 million .\nTraditionally , USDA 's efforts to buy up commodities to take supply off the market have been unpopular with many growers because the purchases have less of a direct effect on their bottom lines . A long list of other commodities , including apples , dairy , oranges , pistachios and potatoes would also be purchased under the plan .\nAlmond growers are a prime example of a sector outside of traditional commodities like corn and wheat where growers were feeling shortchanged . USDA said it will likely buy $ 63 million worth of almonds . California almond farmers \u2014 who grow the state \u2019 s top agricultural export \u2014 had requested additional funding for the industry \u2019 s promotion activities overseas and to have the government cover 100 percent of their crop insurance premiums .\nCalifornia and Washington lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had already complained about the bailout shortchanging growers in their states \u2014 almond growers included . Last month , a group of California lawmakers wrote to USDA expressing concern about \u201c solely relying \u201d on commodity purchases to help farmers who grow tree nuts , like almonds , along with citrus , leafy greens , berries , tree fruit and potatoes \u2014 a category known as specialty crops .\n\u201c [ A ] ny program that is focused on direct payments should be constructed in a way that can also work for the growers of these types of commodities , \u201d they wrote .\nEarlier this month , House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) held a call with the White House Office of Management and Budget , ostensibly to press for more aid for California interests .
