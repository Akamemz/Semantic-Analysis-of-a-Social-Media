The book of Leviticus tells how to quarantine lepers . Hippocrates covered the issue in a three-volume set on epidemics , though he came from a time in ancient Greece when disease was thought to spread from `` miasmas , '' or foul-smelling gas that came out of the ground . With proposed quarantines for Americans exposed to Ebola in the news , we offer a look at quarantine use \u2014 and abuse \u2014 over the ages .\nThe so-called Black Death killed 20 million Europeans in the 14th century . So Venice , a major trade port , grew nervous . If a ship was suspected of harboring plague , it had to wait 40 days before any passengers or goods could come ashore . Venice built a hospital/quarantine center on an island off its coast , where sailors from plague-infested ships were sent either to get better , or , more likely , to die . This 40-day waiting period became known as quarantinario , from the Italian word for 40 . As opinions about the disease changed , the isolation period shrank to trentinario \u2014 30 days \u2014 but the original name stuck .\nAlmost 5,000 people died over the course of two years , about a tenth of the city 's population . Thousands fled for the countryside , and at the height of the epidemic , when nearly 100 people were dying every day , the city government collapsed . Philadelphia was the capital of the country , but the federal government evacuated rather than face the scourge . The best known cure at the time was to `` bleed '' patients of infected blood and give them wine \u2014 and a popular theory on stopping the disease was to quarantine sailors at the Lazaretto , a hospital outside the city . But the disease is spread through mosquitoes , so quarantine was not as effective as the cold snap that eventually killed the infected insects . The Lazaretto , named after Lazarus , the Biblical leper treated and brought back to life by Jesus , remains the oldest surviving quarantine hospital in the United States .\nIn 1892 , a boat carrying many Russian Jewish immigrants arrived at Ellis Island . Passengers in steerage class had developed such bad cases of body lice that the harbor inspector declared he had `` never seen a more bedraggled group , '' according to University of Michigan medical historian Howard Markel . Lice led to typhus , but by the time that disease was discovered , the passengers had spread out to boarding houses and family homes across New York 's Lower East Side . At least 70 were rounded up and quarantined in tents on North Brother Island in the East River . An outbreak of cholera followed in New York , from a ship bringing more Russian Jewish immigrants .

'' She was an Irish-born cook who carried the bacteria that causes typhoid fever , a form of salmonella that can cause fever , diarrhea and death . But Mallon herself was immune to the disease . When authorities figured out that her work as a cook had caused the city 's typhoid outbreak , she was sent to North Brother Island for a three-year quarantine . She promised never to cook for others again . But she broke her word . ( She was especially fond of making peach ice cream . ) When apprehended in 1915 , she was sent back to the island for the rest of her life \u2014 23 more years .\nWith World War I raging , the U.S. military became concerned about the number of young men ineligible for the draft because of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and gonorrhea . They also noticed an uptick in `` camp girls , '' prostitutes and other women hanging around U.S. training grounds and military recruitment centers . A federal order allowed for the incarceration of prostitutes and camp girls until they were deemed STD-free via mandatory testing . Harvard University medical historian Allan Brandt estimates at least 30,000 women were picked up in raids . `` There 's no evidence that this impacted the rates of transmission , '' he says . `` But there was this notion that these women constituted a serious threat to our success in the war . '' He notes that while the women were being rounded up and held in prison , often long after they 'd tested negative , the Army was issuing condoms to soldiers shipping off to France .\nThis global pandemic , which killed an estimated 50 million , prompted quarantine and isolation , as well as school cancellations in Europe and a ban on public gatherings in parts of the U.S . These methods merely held the disease at bay temporarily and were `` hugely socially disruptive , '' according to University of Michigan 's Markel . Influenza is one of the most contagious diseases in the world . A few minutes with a patient who is coughing and sneezing can be enough to transmit the disease .

'' No quarantines went into effect , he says , thanks to a loud opposition movement .\nThough the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) pandemic of 2003 led to quarantines in many different countries , Canada 's response was the most disproportionate to the risk . According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health , Canada quarantined almost 100 people for every confirmed SARS case in the country . Though Toronto only had 250 probable cases , about 30,000 people were confined in hospitals and their homes . A comparable number were quarantined in Beijing , which had 2,500 cases .\nAndrew Speaker , a lawyer from Atlanta , was suspected of having extensively multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , a dangerous version of the infectious and deadly respiratory disease . While awaiting test results , Speaker flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon , hitting Paris , Athens , Mykonos island , Rome and Prague . Then he flew to Montreal and was able to cross the border to the U.S. , where he was put under the first involuntary isolation order since 1963 ( that one occurred when a traveler was incorrectly suspected of having smallpox ) . Speaker apologized to those he 'd flown with but insisted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told him he was safe to travel .
