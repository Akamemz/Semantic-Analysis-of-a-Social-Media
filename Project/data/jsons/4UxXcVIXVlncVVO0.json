The outcome could have far-reaching implications because the contours of congressional districts drawn by Republican-controlled legislatures are seen as a driving reason why Democrats may be locked in the House minority until at least after the next census in 2020 .\nIn Virginia , Democrats are hoping to redraw the lines to make some GOP districts more competitive after a panel of federal judges ruled recently that the Republican-led Legislature \u2019 s decision to pack African-American voters into the 3rd Congressional District , which is represented by Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott , was motivated purely by race \u2014 a violation of the 14th Amendment .\nOther battleground states such as North Carolina and Florida also have redistricting battles pending .\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court recently made the opposite decision in a case similar to Virginia \u2019 s , and plaintiffs have already said they will take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court . And in Florida , a coalition of Democratic groups has appealed a court \u2019 s decision to keep the state \u2019 s congressional districts , which were tweaked only slightly by the Legislature last year after a court threw them out .\nBut the Virginia court ruling striking down the state \u2019 s map based on race , and the legislative wrangling that \u2019 s been triggered by it , has put the commonwealth in the spotlight because of the potential to boost Democrats in other states as well .\n\u201c The Virginia case is so important because it tells government decision makers how to evaluate the use of race in the redistricting process , \u201d said Justin Levitt , a redistricting expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles , who also worked as the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s National Voter Protection counsel in 2008 .\nLevitt added that the divided government in Virginia with Democrats controlling the governorship and Republicans controlling the Legislature opens up the real possibility for revisions to the map that might be more in line with a string of recent Democratic victories in close statewide races : The contests for Virginia \u2019 s 13 electoral votes in the presidential race have mirrored the national popular vote in the past two elections . The state \u2019 s Senate races in 2014 and 2012 were among the closest in the country . The 2013 governor \u2019 s race was decided by fewer than 3 points , and its attorney general , Democrat Mark Herring , was elected only after a protracted recount .\nBut 2014 \u2019 s congressional races weren \u2019 t just lopsided in the GOP \u2019 s favor overall , the individual races weren \u2019 t even close : Each contest was decided by a margin of more than 16 points .\nThe dichotomy between statewide offices and the congressional delegation is a familiar story for Democrats . As a result of population patterns and gerrymandering , Democrats find themselves in the minority in the congressional delegations in other swing states . President Obama has won Florida twice , but Republicans hold 17 of 27 House seats . In Ohio , the GOP controls 12 of 16 seats . In Pennsylvania , it \u2019 s 13 of 18 .\nAfter losing control of governorships and state legislatures before the latest round of redistricting , the party is taking the fight to the courts . Democrats have been financing legal battles over redistricting across the country in an effort to make some political gains in key states , including in Virginia , where Democrats see an opportunity to change the political dichotomy in the state .\nAfter a panel of federal judges last October struck down the state \u2019 s congressional map , the court ordered the Legislature to draw a new map by April 1 . But the decision has since been appealed , leaving open the question of when or if the districts will actually need to be redrawn . The status of Virginia \u2019 s map is largely dependent on a similar case out of Alabama , on which the Supreme Court is expected to rule later this year . ?\nStill , the case in Virginia has given Democrats a chance to push for new lines that could make at least two districts \u2014 the 2nd and 4th , currently represented by GOP Reps. Scott Rigell and Randy Forbes , respectively \u2014 more competitive once some of the black population from Scott \u2019 s district is moved .\n\u201c The court \u2019 s ruling cemented what everyone already knows about Virginia \u2019 s congressional districts , which is that they are wildly unfair and need to change , \u201d said Morgan Finkelstein , spokeswoman for the Virginia Democratic Party . \u201c These gerrymandered districts leave no room for moderation when Virginia Republicans are more concerned with a tea party challenge than with actually representing what the majority of Virginians want . That does not benefit Virginia . \u201d\nAlthough Republicans still hold a majority in the state Legislature , if the lower court \u2019 s decision is upheld the GOP will have to work with Democratic Gov . Terry McAuliffe to draw a new map .\nRepublicans might try to mitigate potential Democratic gains in the districts held by Rigell and Forbes by moving black voters to the 7th District instead , a solidly conservative district now represented by GOP Rep. Dave Brat , who defeated then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a Republican primary last year and took office in a special election after Cantor resigned . Brat might not have the seniority and influence in the state to keep Virginia \u2019 s GOP leadership from making his district more Democratic .\nWhen asked about that scenario , Brat said after a long pause : \u201c I don \u2019 t think we know anything yet . It \u2019 s all in flux . There \u2019 s no \u2018 it \u2019 yet to be concerned about . \u201d\nAnother scenario that some Democrats in the state are considering , sources say , is a standoff between McAuliffe and the Republicans in the state Legislature , which would take the redistricting process entirely out of their hands and give the courts control .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve heard some Democrats say that won \u2019 t be so bad because it can \u2019 t get any worse than it is now , but it could be better for them if the courts could make these districts more competitive , \u201d said Quentin Kidd , director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University . \u201c The question is \u2014 do you take a reputational hit for your state for potential partisan gain ? \u201d\nWhile some in the black community are worried about breaking up Scott \u2019 s district , the congressman is confident he can keep his seat even with a minority-influenced district , rather than a majority-minority district .\n\u201c The Republicans appealed . I didn \u2019 t . So you \u2019 ll have to ask them what they \u2019 re so worried about , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m not concerned . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Republicans have argued that wide margins of victory in House races don \u2019 t qualify as political gerrymandering , pointing to the fact that Obama narrowly carried Rigell \u2019 s district in 2012 , and Mitt Romney won Forbes \u2019 by only 2 points .\n\u201c These are competitive districts , \u201d said former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis , who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his tenure . \u201c Rigell and Forbes run way ahead because voters like them . \u201d\nRepublican Rep.-elect Barbara Comstock \u2019 s seat , the Northern Virginia-based 10th District , voted for Obama by 3 points in 2008 and for Romney by 1 point in 2012 . But Comstock defeated Democrat John Foust by more than 16 points in November and will have the power of incumbency in future races .\nThe potential remap comes amid a broader , nonpartisan push for redistricting reform in Virginia . Groups like OneVirginia2021 and the bipartisan ethics commission appointed by McAullife in the wake of the corruption case against former GOP Gov . Bob McDonnell hope to draw a more competitive map in the future .\n\u201c Virginia is one of the most gerrymandered states in the country , \u201d argued Greg Lucyk , president of the board of directors for OneVirginia2021 . \u201c The districts make legislative elections a meaningless exercise . \u201d\nEven Bill Bolling , a former GOP lieutenant governor who is co-chair of the ethics commission , is pushing for a more bipartisan process of drawing the state \u2019 s congressional map . \u201c I think there is a concern in the state \u2014 and a legitimate concern \u2014 as a result of the last redistricting process that we have very few districts that are competitive , \u201d said Bolling , who decried the rightward tilt of the Virginia GOP after being pushed out of the 2013 governor \u2019 s race by the more conservative Ken Cuccinelli .\nBolling \u2019 s commission passed a set of recommendations calling on governor and Legislature to work together to create nonpartisan districts within 10 business days of the General Assembly convening its 2015 regular session on Jan. 14 . It also pushed the Legislature to amend the commonwealth \u2019 s constitution to create an independent redistricting commission before 2020 .\n\u201c The only real battle is for the Republican or Democratic nomination , \u201d Bolling added . \u201c Republicans that tend to get nominated are farther to the right and the Democrats are farther to the left , so this current redistricting process is a major contributor to the gridlock in Congress . \u201d",
