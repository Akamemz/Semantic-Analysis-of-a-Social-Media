    "content": "On September 13 , danah boyd took the stage at the Online News Association \u2019 s annual conference in Austin . She is the founder and president of Data and Society , a research institute dedicated to \u201c the thorny issues at the intersection of technology and society. \u201d The topic she had come to address , and the audience before which she had chosen to address it , was among the thorniest . boyd was in Austin to tell the media they were getting played .\n\u201c I \u2019 m hoping that you can hear what I \u2019 m saying , \u201d she told the assembled journalists . \u201c Because our democracy depends on you recognizing that you are being manipulated . \u201d\nThe manipulators boyd was talking about were mostly alt-right and alt-light trolls , conspiracy theorists , and provocateurs . They would do or say something offensive or outrageous , bathe in the flood of negative publicity , and use the media \u2019 s coverage \u2014 particularly its storm of outraged , fact-checking , oppositional coverage \u2014 to whip up their base , generate interest in their ideas , and stoke the belief that the MSM was against them .\nboyd was warning the journalists that the strategies of modern media manipulators were different \u2014 they had learned to thrive on negative coverage , and had discovered they could popularize ideas and recruit sympathizers by provoking the media into trying to discredit their noxious ideas .\n\u201c Their goal is to get the news media to negate [ their ] frame \u2014 and negate the conspirators who are propagating that frame , \u201d she warned . For some people , having the media turn en masse to say something is vicious and untrue makes them think : Huh , I wonder if that \u2019 s true . I wonder what they \u2019 re trying to hide ?\nThe approach had become predictable , but the media seemed unable or unwilling to stop falling for it , boyd said . She even laid it out in a clean , bulleted list :\nMedia manipulators have developed a strategy with three parts that rely on how the current media ecosystem is structured : 1 . Create spectacle , using social media to get news media coverage . 2 . Frame the spectacle through phrases that drive new audiences to find your frames through search engines . 3 . Become a \u201c digital martyr \u201d to help radicalize others .\nboyd suggested there was a simple way to shut down the manipulations of these trolls . \u201c Ignore their attention games and focus your reporting on the wide range of non-hateful political views in this country that aren \u2019 t screaming loudly to get your attention , \u201d she advised .\nI \u2019 ve been thinking a lot about boyd \u2019 s speech lately , but the particular media manipulator who has me thinking about it presents unique problems , and the dynamics surrounding him defy her solutions .\nI \u2019 m talking , of course , about the president of the United States .\nLast week , law enforcement apprehended a pro-Trump obsessive who was mailing bombs to the president \u2019 s political opponents . Over the weekend , an anti-Semite entered a synagogue in Philadelphia and murdered 11 Jewish worshippers on the grounds that Jews were behind the caravan of migrants that Trump keeps hyping as an existential threat to American safety .\nOn Monday morning , Trump logged on to Twitter to change the subject :\nThere is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate , and even fraudulent , reporting of the news . The Fake News Media , the true Enemy of the People , must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly . That will do much to put out the flame ... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) October 29 , 2018\nIt \u2019 s easy to read Trump \u2019 s tweets , with their quasi-random capitalization , and miss the care with which they \u2019 re crafted . But there \u2019 s a phrase in this one that Trump knows elicits more media outrage than any other : \u201c the true Enemy of the People. \u201d The media doesn \u2019 t much care when the president calls them fake news anymore . But calling them the enemy of the people mere days after a mentally imbalanced MAGA obsessive sent them bombs in the mail ? The media isn \u2019 t going to ignore that . And Trump knew it .\nBut this wasn \u2019 t just a morning missive from Trump . This was a coordinated message from his White House .\nOn Monday afternoon , press secretary Sarah Sanders held her first press briefing since October 3rd to reiterate Trump \u2019 s sentiments . The rare briefing was held for one reason , and one reason only : Sanders wanted an on-camera confrontation with the media , and she got it .\nJIM ACOSTA : Can you state for the record which outlets that you and the president regard as the enemy of the people ? SANDERS : I \u2019 m not going to walk through a list , but I think those individuals probably know who they are .\nAs the briefing wrapped up , Sanders delivered the message she wanted the country to hear . \u201c You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country , when 90 percent of the coverage of everything this president does is negative , despite the fact that the country is doing extremely well , despite the fact that the president is delivering on exactly what he said he was going to do if elected , \u201d she said . \u201c And he got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him , and wanted to see his policies enacted . \u201d\nIt was a perfect statement . It combined an outrageously timed attack on the media with a complaint that Trump just can \u2019 t get fair coverage and wrapped it in the kind of easily proven lie the press can \u2019 t resist covering ( far from being elected by an \u201c overwhelming majority , \u201d Trump lost the popular vote ) .\nTrump needs an enemy , and his enemy is the media\nDays after Trump \u2019 s inauguration , then-chief strategist Steve Bannon gave an interview to the New York Times .\n\u201c I want you to quote this , \u201d Bannon said . \u201c The media here is the opposition party . \u201d\nJust in case his point was missed , he said it again . \u201c You \u2019 re the opposition party . Not the Democratic Party . You \u2019 re the opposition party . The media \u2019 s the opposition party . \u201d\nTrump has always treated his presidency as a reality show , and every good reality show needs a villain . From day one , Trump wanted his villain to be the media . With Democrats basically powerless , the media was the only force powerful enough to make continuing sense of Trump \u2019 s aggrieved , oppositional political style .\nThe problem was the media didn \u2019 t want to be Trump \u2019 s opposition party . The media wanted to cover his presidency . Early on , the media wanted more than anything else to normalize his presidency , and their coverage of it ; there was a constant hunt for the moments when Trump appeared presidential or seemed to be changing his behavior to better match the burdens of his office .\nTrump \u2019 s solution to that problem has been to provoke the media into looking like his opposition by lying in more absurd ways and directly attacking them in more outrageous ways at more and more outrageous times . Remember , for instance , \u201c The FAKE NEWS awards , \u201d which Trump hyped on Twitter for weeks ?\nTrump leverages the trollish formulas boyd outlined to perfection : He uses Twitter to create spectacle on social media , deploys catchy and unusual frames ( \u201c FAKE NEWS ! \u201d \u201c the true Enemy of the People \u201d ) that sympathizers can search for to find supporting evidence or fellow loyalists , and then uses the media \u2019 s aggrieved or simply truth-telling reaction to paints himself as a victim of endless media bias ( \u201c 90 percent of the coverage of everything this president does is negative \u201d ) .\nThe media then reacts in the only way that makes any sense given the situation : We cover Trump \u2019 s statements as outrageous and aberrant ; we make clear where he \u2019 s lied or given succor to violent paranoiacs ; we fret over the future of the free press . And then Trump and his loyalists point to our overwhelmingly negative coverage and say , \u201c See ? Told you they were the opposition party . \u201d\nTrump , in other words , manipulates the media using the same tactics as a run-of-the-mill alt-right troll , and for much the same reason : He wants the media to fight with him so he gets more coverage and shows how biased they are against him . He wants the media to fight him because that drives attention to the things he \u2019 s saying , to the conspiracies he \u2019 s popularizing , and to himself . Going to war with the media nets Trump much more coverage than giving a speech on manufacturing policy or tax cuts .\nThe problem is Donald Trump isn \u2019 t your run-of-the-mill troll . He \u2019 s the president of the United States of America .\nIn her important report on the way trolls manipulate the media into amplifying their messages , communications scholar Whitney Phillips summed up the media \u2019 s lose-lose choice well . \u201c It is problematic enough when everyday citizens help spread false , malicious , or manipulative information across social media , \u201d she writes . \u201c It is infinitely more problematic when journalists , whose work can reach millions , do the same . At least , it can be infinitely more problematic . It can also be a critical contribution to public discourse . \u201d\nPhillips was talking about the difficult questions involved in covering online neo-Nazis and alt-right provocateurs , but the bind applies with vastly more force to Trump himself . Constantly covering Trump \u2019 s endless attacks on the press , his lies , his violations of basic decency and norms , crowds out coverage of arguably more consequential questions , like his baldfaced lying about the GOP \u2019 s health care plan or the specifics of Democrats \u2019 agenda if they retake Congress .\nBut covering a US president \u2019 s proto-fascist language about the free press is also a critical contribution to public discourse . The term \u201c newsworthy \u201d may be abused and opaque , but that \u2019 s newsworthy under any definition .\nWhat do you do , though , when coverage of that proto-fascist language is actually the point of the language in the first place ? Trump wants to bait the media into looking like his opposition . He wants us to make the dominant and constant topic of political conversation his war with , well , us .\nAs press critic Jay Rosen put it , the media has no idea what to cover when \u201c the erosion of democratic institutions \u2014 not just the press , but all of them \u2014 is part of how the political movement [ the president ] leads is powered . \u201d\nThe media used to have a stick here : negative coverage . Sure , you could get us to cover you by being outrageous or offensive , but you wouldn \u2019 t want that kind of coverage . That kind of coverage could destroy your career .\nBut Trump does want that kind of coverage . That kind of coverage is how he built his political career . That kind of coverage is how he shows that we \u2019 re his opposition , that he \u2019 s an underdog at war with the Washington \u201c deep state. \u201d Even better , that kind of coverage lets him crowd out the kind of coverage he really doesn \u2019 t want \u2014 coverage of his actual agenda , which trends toward plutocracy rather than populism ; of other politicians , who have ideas and messages that could threaten Trump \u2019 s presidency if only they could get heard .\n\u201c Journalists have become more savvy in how they deal with lower-level trolls , \u201d Phillips told me by phone . \u201c They figured out how to not engage with them on Twitter . But no one has quite figured out what to do when the president is engaging in similar behaviors . You can \u2019 t just ignore him , can you ? \u201d Then I heard her tone change . \u201c That \u2019 s a genuine question . Can we ignore him ? Does it make sense ? Is it ethical to look at something the president of the United States says and decide we won \u2019 t report that ? \u201d\nNor is it obvious that if the mainstream media ignored Trump \u2019 s provocations , stunts , and obsessions in favor of focusing on more substantive parts of his agenda , it would much matter . Trump has his own communication channels . This is a point Sanders has made defending her decision to rarely hold press briefings ( a decision she defended , naturally , on Fox News ) . \u201c The day that the briefing was initially created , the atmosphere was incredibly different and you didn \u2019 t have the same access and ways to communicate with the American public , \u201d she said .\nSocial media and propagandistic outlets like Fox News let Trump drive the story before any independent editorial judgment comes into play . Mainstream publications that ignore the controversies he creates would make themselves look like the opposition in a totally different way , and would likely lose market share to outlets that swarmed around Trump \u2019 s provocations and reaped the social and search traffic that came with it .\nTrump often winks at this relationship he has with the media , the way his attacks are good politics for him and good business for us . In December , he told the New York Times :\nAnother reason that I \u2019 m going to win another four years is because newspapers , television , all forms of media will tank if I \u2019 m not there because without me , their ratings are going down the tubes . Without me , the New York Times will indeed be not the failing New York Times , but the failed New York Times . So they basically have to let me win . And eventually , probably six months before the election , they \u2019 ll be loving me because they \u2019 re saying , \u201c Please , please , don \u2019 t lose Donald Trump .\nThis is the part of the piece where I \u2019 m supposed to offer solutions , I think . But I don \u2019 t have good ones . I think media outlets need to develop a clearer rubric for newsworthiness as a way of making coverage decisions less reactive to Trump tweets . At \u2588\u2588\u2588 , for instance , we weight policy stories more heavily , which gives a different mix to our news , but of course , we cover Trump \u2019 s tweets and provocations as well \u2014 hell , this whole piece is , in a sense , me covering Trump \u2019 s tweets and provocations .\n\u201c You can starve lower-level manipulators of oxygen , \u201d says Phillips . \u201c How do you starve the president of oxygen ? He creates his own oxygen . \u201d\nThe first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one . And we have one . Trump has shown you can build a whole presidency around provocation . He has shown that you can always manipulate the media into swarming you with negative coverage and looking like your enemy , and then you can run against the media at the same time you \u2019 re discrediting it to your followers . He has shown that you can shut down your competitors , challengers , and opponents by being so outrageous that you simply deny them the oxygen of media coverage .\nThis strategy is dangerous for the country , but it \u2019 s worked for Trump , and it could work for others if nothing changes . \u201c He has established a coherent behavioral template for others to borrow from , \u201d says Phillips . \u201c When something is done and it succeeds , it sends a message to anyone who might want to take a similar behavior down the road that they should press those exact same buttons . \u201d\nCorrection : I initially said this was Sanders \u2019 s first press briefing since September 10th . As best I can figure out , it was her first solo press briefing since 9/10 , but on October 3rd , she hosted a briefing with a number of other members of the White House staff , so I \u2019 ve corrected the text .",

He has shown that you can shut down your competitors, challengers, and opponents by being so outrageous that you simply deny them the oxygen of media coverage.\n\nThis strategy is dangerous for the country, but it\u2019s worked for Trump, and it could work for others if nothing changes. \u201cHe has established a coherent behavioral template for others to borrow from,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cWhen something is done and it succeeds, it sends a message to anyone who might want to take a similar behavior down the road that they should press those exact same buttons.\u201d\n\nCorrection: I initially said this was Sanders\u2019s first press briefing since September 10th. As best I can figure out, it was her first solo press briefing since 9/10, but on October 3rd, she hosted a briefing with a number of other members of the White House staff, so I\u2019ve corrected the text.",
