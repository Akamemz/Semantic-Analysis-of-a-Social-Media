    "content": "Young immigrants across the country were elated after the Supreme Court \u2019 s favorable ruling Thursday for DACA , the program that temporarily shields about 650,000 undocumented people from deportation . But Maria Garcia is not cheering\u2014at least not yet .\nGarcia , who is 17 and just finished high school in Tempe , Arizona , has everything needed to be eligible for DACA . She was 4 years old when her Mexican parents sent her across the border with a smuggler\u2014 \u201c some random lady , \u201d as she remembers it . She has never been in legal trouble and graduated with a 4.0 grade point average . She is two years older than the program \u2019 s lower age limit of 15 .\nYet Garcia has not been able to apply for DACA . After President Trump \u2019 s decision to cancel the program in 2017 , and the court fights that followed , immigrants who already had two-year permits under DACA have been allowed to renew them . But no new applications were accepted .\nShe is in a cohort of foreign-born teenagers , part of a group sometimes called Dreamers , who turned 15 after the program was terminated on Sept. 5 , 2017 . They are coming of age without legal papers , facing fears , frustrations and roadblocks that immigrants just a few years older have avoided with DACA . There are about 66,000 of them , according to an estimate by the Migration Policy Institute , a non-partisan research center , and they could be eligible to apply for DACA after the Supreme Court decision .\nBut it is not clear that Trump will let them in .\nLawyers are debating the impact of the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling . In a 5-to-4 decision , the court found that the Trump administration acted unlawfully in ending the program , failing to follow procedural rules or to take into account the hardships for immigrants who had built their lives around it . The court sent the matter back to the Department of Homeland Security \u201c so that it may consider the problem anew , \u201d and sent three cases back to lower courts for further action .\nTrump , who once called DACA holders \u201c incredible kids , \u201d immediately threatened to cancel the program again .\nAs President of the United States , I am asking for a legal solution on DACA , not a political one , consistent with the rule of law . The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one , so now we have to start this process all over again . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 18 , 2020\nChad Wolf , the acting secretary of Homeland Security , said the ruling \u201c usurps the clear authority of the executive branch to end unlawful programs. \u201d But administration officials issued no guidance on how they planned to proceed .\nSome legal scholars argued that the administration is required to restore the program with no delay and begin taking new applications . \u201c The effect of the ruling is we go back to life as it was before September 2017 , \u201d said Marisol Orihuela , a professor at Yale Law School .\nOthers predicted the administration would not accept new applications unless , after further court battles , a judge orders them to re-open the program completely . If Trump moves to end DACA again , bureaucratic procedures and court fights would likely leave the current configuration in place past the election in November .\nThe legal fog was bewildering to young people who could be receiving DACA \u2019 s protections but are still left out .\n\u201c What happened is one step , \u201d Garcia said guardedly of the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling , by phone from her home in Phoenix , \u201c but we still have a way to go . \u201d\nThe Obama administration created DACA , or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , in 2012 , and the program doesn \u2019 t grant a formal immigration status . For undocumented immigrants who came here as children , it offers temporary protection from deportation and a two-year , renewable work permit with a Social Security number . But the program removed obstacles many young people faced because of their lack of legal status , opening door after door .\n\u201c Within a year , they were already taking giant steps , \u201d said Roberto Gonzales , a professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education who has studied the program since it started . \u201c They found new jobs . They increased their earnings . They acquired driver 's licenses . They began to build credit through opening bank accounts and obtaining credit cards . \u201d\nFor Garcia , however , Trump \u2019 s cancellation of DACA just when she was old enough to apply was a painful blow .\nAside from her schoolwork , she started running track for her Tempe high school . By senior year she was the school \u2019 s top runner , she said . But as she applied to colleges and scholarships , she received only impersonal form letters of rejection because she didn \u2019 t have a Social Security number .\n\u201c I basically didn \u2019 t know where I was going in my life , \u201d she said . \u201c I wanted to give up . \u201d\nAt the last minute she discovered a scholarship program called TheDream.US , which provides financial aid for college even if students are undocumented .
