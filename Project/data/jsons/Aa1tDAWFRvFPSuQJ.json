Yet as I read the attacks on Lilla , I was struck by the extent to which his critics were either ignorant of or indifferent to the way in which conservatives and many moderate white Americans experience identity politics . They do not know the face that identity politics presents to Americans outside the progressive bubble .\nTo Lilla \u2019 s critics , minority identity politics is a defensive response to white identity politics ( sometimes outright white supremacy ) that is necessary for achieving a measure of justice and fairness in society . Sure , there are excesses , but they \u2019 re mainly confined to the fringes of the academy , where outrages are exaggerated by the likes of Fox News . Here \u2019 s the New Yorker \u2019 s David Remnick making that case in his interview with Lilla :\nAnd one of the things right-wing media does is take some examples of exaggerated identity politics , in your terms\u2014cartoonish moments\u2014and blow them up on Fox or Breitbart or the rest , and make it seem as if every student at Columbia or Oberlin or the University of Chicago is inflamed with this . Am I wrong ?\nWhen I read words like that , I think they just don \u2019 t know . Or maybe they know \u2014 but don \u2019 t care \u2014 the extent to which a hostile , illiberal brand of identity politics has seeped into every nook and cranny of American culture . It \u2019 s not the case that conservative Americans sit ensconced in their immense privilege , raging at an irrelevant fringe hyped up by Fox News . Rather they experience identity politics at their jobs , hear their children and grandchildren describe experiencing it at school , and find it so omnipresent on television and online that they can \u2019 t seem to find any space ( aside from conservative media ) where someone isn \u2019 t mocking their values or accusing them of being complicit in historical atrocities .\nAt colleges , immersion in identity politics begins on Day One , when countless students start their orientation-mandated \u201c privilege walks \u201d designed to teach white kids who don \u2019 t have a racist bone in their body that there is something inherently wrong with them . People are treated as members of groups , not individuals , which leads to the absurd spectacle of poor kids \u2019 being mocked as \u201c privileged \u201d by the wealthy , powerful children of doctors and lawyers .\nOh , and the outrages are not limited to the very few cases that make Fox News . For every embattled student group we hear about , there are dozens more that suffer in obscurity .
