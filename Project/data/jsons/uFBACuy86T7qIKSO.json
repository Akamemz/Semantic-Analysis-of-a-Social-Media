In the early October meeting , Mr. Halper reportedly asked , \u201c George , you know about hacking the emails from Russia , right ? \u201d\nMr. Trump equated the tactic with spying and said it could go down as the \u201c all time biggest political scandal ! \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Top Democrat deems claims Trump campaign was spied on \u2018 nonsense \u2019\nMr. Papadopoulos would become the subject of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential race . The Trump campaign \u2019 s former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty in October to making false statements to the FBI .\nIn a statement Sunday night , Sarah Isgur Flores , director of public affairs at the Justice Department , said the department \u2019 s watchdog has been asked to look into the accusations of improper surveillance .\n\u201c The Department has asked the Inspector General to expand the ongoing review of the FISA application process to include determining whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election , \u201d Ms. Flores said . \u201c As always , the Inspector General will consult with the appropriate U.S. Attorney if there is any evidence of potential criminal conduct . \u201d\nRep. Mark Meadows , North Carolina Republican and chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus , said Mr. Trump is making the right call .\nBut he also said the Justice Department can \u2019 t be impartial about policing itself . He pointed to the department \u2019 s refusal to turn over to the House documents outlining the scope of Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve seen disturbing evidence that the FBI engaged in political targeting , \u201d Mr. Meadows tweeted . \u201c But the DOJ can \u2019 t be trusted to investigate themselves \u2014 Congress needs the documents too . [ Deputy Attorney General ] Rod Rosenstein : where are the documents ? Show Americans the truth . \u201d\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan , a harsh critic of Mr. Trump , had a different idea about what Congress should do , lashing out at the president Sunday on Twitter and calling on congressional Republican leaders to stop him .\n\u201c Senator [ Mitch ] McConnell & Speaker [ Paul ] Ryan : If Mr. Trump continues along this disastrous path , you will bear major responsibility for the harm done to our democracy , \u201d Mr. Brennan tweeted . \u201c You do a great disservice to our Nation & the Republican Party if you continue to enable Mr. Trump \u2019 s self-serving actions . \u201d\nRep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said the idea that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign is nonsense .\n\u201c The most I can tell you , Chuck , is that this claim by the president , the suggestion by [ Rudolph W. ] Giuliani that there is a political spy embedded in the Trump campaign , is nonsense , \u201d Mr. Schiff told Chuck Todd on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c And you hear it in the same terms that Trump often speaks , which is \u2018 people are saying , \u2019 or \u2018 I \u2019 m hearing , \u2019 or \u2018 We \u2019 re being told. \u2019 That \u2019 s another way of saying , \u2018 This is patently untrue , but we would like to spread it anyway. \u2019 And it \u2019 s singularly destructive of our institutions , but then that \u2019 s the point . \u201d\nIf reports of the informant are true , Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and chairman of the House intelligence committee , said it \u2019 s a \u201c red line \u201d that the FBI should not be allowed to cross .\n\u201c If they paid someone , it \u2019 s an absolute red line , and this is over with , \u201d he said . \u201c I mean , there is no possible way that we should be allowing , even if it was legal , we should never allow this in this country . Congress should not allow for anything like this to ever occur again to any political campaign , if it in fact happened . \u201d\nMr. Nunes , who has accused the Justice Department of stonewalling congressional document requests , said it \u2019 s impossible to tell how many informants were working to infiltrate the Trump campaign .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know if there \u2019 s one informant or more informants because there \u2019 s so much out there now , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s really getting tough to follow , and all we \u2019 re asking for is give us the documentation that you used to start this investigation . \u201d\nMr. Nunes also questioned the timing of the media reports about the FBI \u2019 s informant , effectively accusing at least some people within the Justice Department of trying to set him up .\nHe said the Justice Department had invited him and Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , to a meeting Friday , which the lawmakers declined to attend after information from a previous meeting was leaked to the press .\n\u201c They were trying to get Mr. Gowdy and I to go on Friday to the Department of Justice for supposedly another briefing , \u201d Mr. Nunes said . \u201c We said , \u2018 Look , unless we \u2019 re going to get documents. \u2019 We found out Thursday night they were not going to provide documents , so therefore we \u2019 re not going to go . Now , if you look what happened on Friday night , probably the mother of all leaks of all time to two major newspapers that came out late Friday night . Now had Mr. Gowdy and I went to that meeting , you can bet they would have tried to pin that on us . \u201d\nThe accusations of spying have emerged as patience with Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation grows thin . The president \u2019 s allies point out that no evidence of collusion with a foreign adversary has been made public .\nRoger Stone , a longtime Trump aide , said it \u2019 s \u201c not inconceivable \u201d that Mr. Mueller will try to \u201c conjure up \u201d a crime completely unrelated to the 2016 campaign .\n\u201c I can guarantee you they have found no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion , nor trafficking of allegedly hacked emails with WikiLeaks , \u201d Mr. Stone said Sunday on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c It is not inconceivable no-w that Mr. Mueller and his team may seek to conjure up some extraneous crime pertaining to my business or maybe not even pertaining to the 2016 election . \u201d\nOn Sunday , CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper pressed Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , for evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia .\nMr. Warner said that is the \u201c endpoint question that we \u2019 re going to have to deal with . \u201d\n\u201c But have you seen any evidence of that ? \u201d Mr. Tapper shot back .\nMr. Warner pointed to the Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who was offering dirt on Hillary Clinton . He said the meeting shows that the Trump campaign was \u201c receptive to these kinds of offers \u201d and may be indicative of a pattern .\n\u201c Now , did the president know about that meeting or not ? I don \u2019 t know , \u201d Mr. Warner said . \u201c I \u2019 d like to get the answer to that . \u201d\n\u201c Still , as far as the public knows , \u201d Mr. Tapper said , \u201c no evidence of anybody in the Trump team accepting the offers of help , no evidence of actual conspiracy that we know of yet , that we in the public know of yet . And you \u2019 re not willing to comment on whether or not you \u2019 ve seen evidence of that conspiracy . \u201d",
