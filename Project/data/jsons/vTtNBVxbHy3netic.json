    "content": "The red-meat speeches at this week \u2019 s Conservative Political Action Conference are likely to thunder with calls to repeal the Common Core . But out in the trenches , conservative lawmakers in state after state are running into difficulty rounding up votes to revoke the academic standards outright .\nSo , aided at times by unlikely allies in the teachers unions , Republican lawmakers are trying a new tactic : sabotaging , in incremental steps , the academic guidelines and the new Common Core exams rolling out this spring .\nBills to repeal the Common Core have been introduced in 19 states so far this year , down slightly from the 22 states that considered such a step last year , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . So far , they \u2019 ve fared poorly .\nCommon Core opponents had high hopes for rooting out the standards from Mississippi and Arizona . But in both cases , the state senates rejected repeal bills . North Dakota lawmakers killed a repeal bill earlier this month ; on Tuesday , their counterparts in South Dakota did the same .\nKansas state Rep. Ron Highland , a Republican , said he \u2019 s not even sure a repeal bill will come to the floor in his deep-red state this session , much as he would like it to : \u201c I \u2019 m not sure we have the votes , quite frankly . \u201d\nRefusing to concede defeat , Highland said he \u2019 s considering drafting a bill to curb state funding for textbooks and tests aligned to the Common Core and for the computer equipment that schools need to administer those tests online .\nAnd the Common Core tests developed by two federally funded consortia , Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers and Smarter Balanced , have become a popular target in other states .\nWisconsin lawmakers are considering an effort to strip funding for the Smarter Balanced exam from the state budget and let districts pick their own assessments from a state-approved list . The New Jersey General Assembly this week overwhelmingly passed a bill to prevent the PARCC test from being used to evaluate students or teachers until 2019 .\nAnd in Colorado , where Democrats repeatedly have shot down attempts at outright repeal , Republican state Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt is pushing a bill to withdraw the state from the federally funded PARCC testing consortium in what he sees as the first step toward reclaiming local control over education .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not trying to hit a home run , \u201d Klingenschmitt said . \u201c I \u2019 m trying to lay down a bunt single . \u201d\nMeanwhile , teachers unions in New Jersey , Rhode Island , Illinois , Washington and elsewhere are encouraging members to support parents who want to opt their children out of the Common Core tests . The New Jersey Education Association has even launched a six-week TV and online ad campaign featuring videos of parents expressing concern \u2014 to the point of breaking down in tears \u2014 about the PARCC exam .\nYet another creative approach to undermine the Common Core has emerged in New Hampshire , where the state Senate this month passed a bill that explicitly gives local districts , and even individual schools , the right to opt out of the standards .\nMost of the anti-Common Core bills proposed this session have been sponsored by Republicans , though Democrats are taking the lead in New Mexico and Washington state .\nCommon Core foes say the array of tactical maneuvers they \u2019 ve introduced in statehouses shows the movement is maturing and digging in for a long fight . \u201c There \u2019 s much more thoughtful consideration , rather than \u2018 Let \u2019 s just get rid of it , \u2019 \u201d said state Sen. Paul Farrow , a Republican .\n\u201c I feel confident if we don \u2019 t get it done this year , then within the next three years we \u2019 ll get it done , \u201d said Washington state Sen. John McCoy , a Democrat who recently co-sponsored a bipartisan repeal bill .\nCommon Core supporters acknowledge that their dream of using common exams to assess students across the country has already taken a hit and will most likely take more as additional states pull out of the testing consortia . But they insist that the tests aren \u2019 t as important as the standards themselves \u2014 and they feel certain that the overwhelming majority of states will continue to use the standards to shape classroom instruction for years to come .\nAt a press briefing on Wednesday morning , Idaho Gov . Butch Otter , a Republican , made the case that the tea party \u2019 s fierce fight to dismantle the Common Core has failed . He was joined by fellow Common Core supporters Karen Nussle , executive director of the Collaborative for Student Success , and Michael Petrilli , president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute .\nPetrilli spent a lot of time in 2013 and 2014 traveling to testify on behalf of the Common Core in a frantic effort to beat back repeal attempts . This spring , however , he plans to stay in D.C. : He said he \u2019 s confident that local business leaders , teachers and parents who support the Common Core will be able to handle the legislative fights .\n\u201c There are certainly fierce debates going on out there , but just a handful of states are in play , \u201d Petrilli said . \u201c The big story is how resilient this thing has been in the face of a huge national backlash . \u201d\nConsider Mississippi . The tea party group FreedomWorks has made the state a priority target in its anti-Common Core campaign ; it even staged a rally outside the state capitol this winter featuring Republican Gov . Phil Bryant . In early February , Noah Wall , the group \u2019 s grass-roots director , called the movement in Mississippi \u201c powerful \u201d and told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he was \u201c really excited \u201d about the prospects for a repeal .\nLess than a week after that conversation , however , the Mississippi Senate rejected the repeal effort . Instead , the chamber voted to create a commission to recommend new standards \u2014 but left it up to the state Board of Education to decide whether to adopt them or to stick with the Common Core . The board so far has backed the Common Core standards , calling them more rigorous than Mississippi \u2019 s previous academic guidelines .\nDespite the defeat , FreedomWorks continues to send out fundraising pleas in which it pledges to eradicate the standards nationwide . \u201c Every dollar you give goes toward making sure one more child doesn \u2019 t have to learn under Common Core standards , \u201d one recent email promised .\nOther groups are also stepping up mobilization efforts . American Principles in Action , for instance , just launched a new website meant to rally parents against the Common Core .\nA recent national poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that only 17 percent of Americans support the Common Core , with the remainder divided between opposition and uncertainty . But many respondents were hopelessly confused about the standards , erroneously believing that they covered topics such as global warming , evolution , sex ed and U.S. history . In fact , they cover only math and language arts .\nBackers of the standards continue to believe that if they could just explain the Common Core more clearly , public support would grow . In the meantime , they are counting on powerful groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , teachers unions and even the U.S. military to convince legislators that the standards are good public policy . The Chamber \u2019 s foundation on Tuesday released a new video touting the Common Core \u2014 without ever mentioning it by name \u2014 as essential to prepare kids for the challenging jobs of the future .\nAbout 40 of the 45 states that initially adopted the Common Core remain committed to the standards .\nThe boldest defection has been Oklahoma , where the state Legislature repealed the Common Core and replaced it with the state \u2019 s old academic standards . Indiana also has officially repealed the Common Core , though its new standards are so similar that some lawmakers are now pushing to revoke those , too , and go back to the academic guidelines in place before 2010 .\nNorth Carolina , South Carolina and Missouri have all set up commissions to review and potentially rewrite the standards , but it \u2019 s as yet unclear how much they will diverge from the Common Core , which lays out guidelines for what students at each grade level should learn in language arts and math .\nWhatever happens in state legislatures , activists on both sides agree that the debate will continue to flare at least through the 2016 Republican presidential primary .\nSeveral potential candidates , including Louisiana Gov .
