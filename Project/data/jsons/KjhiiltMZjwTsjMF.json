Then , in one of the most bizarre moments in modern presidential history , he strode across the park to stand in front of an iconic church holding a Bible aloft in a striking photo op .\nIt was a moment of vanity and bravado -- orchestrated for the cameras and transparently political -- as Trump struggles to cope with protests sweeping the country after the killing of George Floyd and tries to cover up his botched leadership during the coronavirus pandemic . Overnight , the White House 's official Twitter account released a triumphant video of the moment set to music but omitting any signs of the mayhem unleashed on the protesters .\nTrump appeared to be trying to project strength at a moment when his presidency seems feckless and as the nation spins out of control . If it occurred abroad and not in the White House , Americans might perceive a ridiculous self-deluding act of a wanna-be strongman .\n`` I thought I was watching a scene from something in Turkey , and not in the United States , '' retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore , who commanded National Guard troops in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper .\nAnd after using St. John 's Church , the `` church of the presidents , '' which had experienced a basement fire during Sunday 's demonstrations , Trump drew immediate criticism from faith leaders , including Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington .\n`` The President just used the Bible , our sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition , and one of the churches of my diocese , without permission , as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus , '' Budde said on `` AC360 . ''\nTrump 's showmanship was motivated in part by anger at media coverage saying he had sheltered in a bunker below the White House on Friday night amid protests in Washington , CNN 's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak reported . It shows how far Trump will go to protect his own thin skin and how his power plays are often motivated by assaults on his dignity .\nBut his behavior is also alarming , considering the vast power at his command , uses of demagogic tropes and capacity to buckle the traditions and structures of civilian , democratic government . So while Trump 's turn to the rhetoric of the despotic leaders he so admires had elements of farce , it opened a sinister new chapter in his presidency and a challenge to American norms .\nJUST WATCHED Don Lemon : This was all a show Replay More Videos ...
