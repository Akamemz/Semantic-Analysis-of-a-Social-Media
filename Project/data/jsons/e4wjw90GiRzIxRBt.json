    "content": "Donald Trump is once again pushing the limit , bringing Megyn Kelly \u2019 s anatomy into a feud that had already opened him to charges of sexism \u2014 and the risk of losing support among the Fox News anchor \u2019 s rabid following .\nAfter a day of escalating hostility , Trump took his attacks on Kelly to the next level on Friday night , apparently insinuating that the moderator had been menstruating when she questioned him during Thursday \u2019 s first Republican debate .\n\u201c You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes , blood coming out of her \u2014 wherever , \u201d he told anchor Don Lemon during an appearance on CNN .\nThe crudeness of the comment sparked an immediate flurry of rebukes , including from RedState.com \u2019 s Erick Erickson , who revoked an invitation for Trump to speak at his Saturday conference on the grounds that it showed he wasn \u2019 t a \u201c legitimate \u201d candidate .\nOn Saturday morning , Trump appeared to tweet a clarification of his previous remark : \u201c Re Megyn Kelly quote : \u2018 you could see there was blood coming out of her eyes , blood coming out of her wherever \u2019 ( NOSE ) . Just got on w/thought . \u201d\nHe also released a statement lashing Erickson and the decision to exclude him . \u201c \u2026 not only is Erick a total loser , he has a history of supporting establishment losers in failed campaigns so it is an honor to be uninvited from his event . Mr. Trump is an outsider and does not fit his agenda . \u201d\nNevertheless , Trump was a hot topic of conversation at the RedState event . Speaking there , Republican 2016 candidate Mike Huckabee said , \u201c The Republican Party is not engaged in a war on women , the Republican Party is not engaged in saying things about Megyn Kelly , \u201d he said . \u201c One individual is . \u201d\nCarly Fiorina , the only female Republican presidential candidate in the race , took to Twitter to condemn Trump .\n\u201c Mr . Trump . There . Is . No . Excuse , \u201d she wrote . \u201c I stand with @ megynkelly . \u201d\nIn a tweet sent Saturday , Gov . Scott Walker also repeated the \u201c stand with @ megynkelly \u201d line , adding , \u201c There \u2019 s no excuse for Trump \u2019 s comments . \u201d\nGov . John Kasich tweeted a statement , saying , \u201c Everyone deserves respect and dignity , whether they agree with you or not . You don \u2019 t tear people down just because they disagree with you or stand up to you or question you . \u201d\nIn a statement , Sen. Lindsey Graham said , \u201c I applaud Erik [ sic ] Erickson for doing the right thing when he disinvited Donald Trump from a gathering of Republican activists . As a party , we are better to risk losing without Donald Trump than trying to win with him . Enough already with Mr. Trump . \u201d\nAlso in a statement , Sen. Rand Paul called Trump \u2019 s statements \u201c inappropriate and offensive . \u201d\nAnd then there was the nature of the target itself . Unlike undocumented immigrants , John McCain or Rosie O \u2019 Donnell , the Fox News anchor enjoys a huge following among the network \u2019 s viewers , who happen to make up the core of the Republican primary electorate . So picking a fight with Kelly \u2014 as Trump did when he chided her during a tough debate question about insults he \u2019 s lobbed at women , dissed her in the spin room , and tweeted his complaints about her \u2014 carries risks that Trump \u2019 s other feuds do not .\nSo does making such a gendered attack on a journalist at a time when his party is battling the perception that it \u2019 s waging a \u201c war on women . \u201d\nBut if Trump world is worried about taking on the only person who might be more popular with the Republican base than their boss is right now , they \u2019 re not showing it .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , maintained that the mogul \u2019 s willingness to take on Kelly makes him the kind of equal-opportunity brawler Republicans will need next fall .\n\u201c If the Democratic nominee is going to be Hillary Clinton , then you would want a strong person to stand up to make America great again , \u201d he said earlier on Friday , before the \u201c blood \u201d comment .\nTrump political adviser Roger Stone sounded a slightly more cautious note . \u201c Certainly Fox reaches a disproportionate number of Republican primary voters , \u201d he said , adding that as of Friday afternoon he hadn \u2019 t yet sorted out his thoughts about the matter .\nStone said Trump was satisfied with his debate performance when the two conferred last night . And Stone offered a positive assessment , if not a ringing endorsement , of his boss \u2019 s performance . \u201c He held his own . He was fine . He made all his key points . \u201d\nBut Trump and his associates clearly had a bone to pick after a debate in which Fox \u2019 s moderators , especially Kelly , trained some of their toughest questions on the controversial front-runner . Trump \u2019 s annoyance showed during the debate when he told her , \u201c I \u2019 ve been very nice to you , although I could probably maybe not be , based on the way you have treated me \u201d in response to a question about his name-calling of women ( which he joked he \u2019 d only ever done to his longtime Twitter nemesis O \u2019 Donnell ) . After the debate , Trump said Kelly \u201c behaved very nasty to me . \u201d\nIn the early morning hours on Friday , his Twitter account tweeted that Kelly was \u201c not very good or professional \u201d and retweeted anti-Kelly tweets from supporters , including one calling her a \u201c bimbo . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s deputy and surrogate , Michael Cohen , retweeted a tweet from a Trump fan ( @ hawaiiluvstrump ) after the debate that included the hashtag \u201c boycottmegynkelly \u201d and the message \u201c we can gut her . \u201d\nCohen told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he does not believe the tweet implied any sort of physical violence but did not back down from his beef with Kelly . \u201c It is interesting to note that the only attacks against Mr. Trump last night came from the moderators , \u201d Cohen said in a statement . \u201c It appeared to all viewers that it was a coordinated effort . Megyn Kelly clearly tried the hardest and failed as Mr. Trump has been deemed the winner of last night \u2019 s debate by multiple polls and media outlets . \u201d\nBecause he works for Trump Enterprises , rather than the campaign , Cohen said that his being in conflict with Kelly shouldn \u2019 t affect Trump \u2019 s political fortunes . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter if I am or I \u2019 m not , \u201d he said .\nMonmouth University pollster Patrick Murray told \u2588\u2588\u2588 after Thursday \u2019 s debate that Trump \u2019 s back-and-forth with Kelly , in which he dismissed her question about insults lobbed at women as \u201c political correctness , \u201d could end up hurting him with female Republican primary voters , a group he is currently winning , though by a smaller margin than he \u2019 s winning men .\nAnd despite the negative reaction of a focus group convened for Fox News by Republican messaging guru Frank Luntz to Trump \u2019 s interactions with Kelly , as well as his refusal to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee , there were indications that his trademark Trump bluster continued to play well with important Republican constituencies .\n( Trump tweeted that Luntz \u201c is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest .
