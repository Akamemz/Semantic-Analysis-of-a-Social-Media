Most importantly, polarization and partisan conflict lead to inaction, as \"my way or the highway,\" ideologically rigid mentalities lower the probability of achieving the compromise that should be at the heart of legislative functioning.

But our society must continue to function, and that functioning requires an underlying agreement in the legitimacy of societal institutions.
