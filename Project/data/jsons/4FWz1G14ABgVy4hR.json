You think about things like same-sex marriage , affirmative action , voting rights -- all of these are issues that have very different ideological components to them , and the more conservative justices definitely have a different view , '' he said .\nBut the landmark health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time as a CNN/ORC poll just days later showed virtually no change in opinions on public attitudes toward Obama or Romney .\nIt is an unusual dynamic : the Supreme Court traditionally rates near the bottom when voters are asked to list the issues most important to them , but the high-profile issues the justices decide -- hot-button topics like health care , abortion , economic and tax reforms -- remain of consistent concern to the electorate .\nThe high court is poised to maintain a period of bench stability for at least a couple more years , barring an unexpected illness or personal crisis . This , after four court vacancies from 2005-2010 brought on Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito , Sonia Sotomayor , and Elena Kagan .\nStill , many court watchers anticipate the man sitting in the Oval Office through 2016 could name at least one and perhaps as many as three members to the Supreme Court . And the recent health care decision may have raised the already high stakes on the makeup of the federal bench at large .\n`` Even more Americans are watching who is on the Supreme Court this election cycle , more so perhaps they have in the past , because there 's a clear connection between who is on the court and how that affects your daily life , '' said Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center . `` The Supreme Court and its ideological divide is really placing the Constitution and the country in many ways at a crossroads . ''\nObama has touted his successful nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan , saying they fit his overall philosophy of what a good judge should be . He has been criticized in the past for using `` empathy '' as a key criterion to nominate judges .\n`` I think that 's why he 's backed off from talking about it , because ultimately the 'empathy ' standard turns a court more into identity politics , '' said Carrie Severino , chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative legal advocacy group .\n`` Ultimately , that 's actually not what Americans want . We do n't want judges that are going to vote their interest group . We want judges who are going to vote with the Constitution : what they think is the correct legal and constitutional result . And that is what Governor Romney has been emphasizing , '' Severino said .\nThe president 's has not talked much about the high court this election year , but he has had an uneasy relationship with its conservative majority .\nRomney has said , if elected , he would `` nominate judges in the mold of Chief Justice [ John ] Roberts . '' But Romney told CBS News this past summer that Roberts made `` political considerations '' in authoring the health care ruling . The Republican nominee supplemented his thoughts on the kinds of judges he would appoint : `` I 'd look for individuals who have the intelligence and believe in following the Constitution . ''\nWydra said the decision on health care `` was sort of a microcosm of the philosophies that are frankly at a crossroads '' at the court . `` And if President Obama gets to nominate one or more justices in his next term , that could solidify the approach of the majority in the Affordable Care Act , which gives the national government the power to solve national problems . ''\nA dynamic California politician and a low-key Washington lawyer have emerged as unofficial favorites for any high court vacancy in the next four years . CNN talked with nearly a dozen sources close to both the Romney and Obama campaigns .\nFor the president 's backers , one name is repeatedly mentioned : Kamala Harris , the Golden State 's elected attorney general . At 48 , the part Asian , part African-American woman has been praised for her political savvy , ethnic background , telegenic personality , law enforcement credentials , and early support of Obama 's 2008 candidacy .\n`` If Justice [ Ruth Bader ] Ginsburg does retire , or President Obama gets another appointment , I do think Kamala Harris is the most likely to be put on , '' said Goldstein , who generated buzz when he analyzed Harris at length eight months ago in his well-respected legal blog . `` The California attorney general has the most political experience , which is really missing on the court right now . She 's diverse , she 's young -- I think kind of a female Barack Obama in some sense . ''\nHarris declined to speculate about a possible move to Washington .\nFor Romney , his legal advisers point to Paul Clement , the former U.S. solicitor general , as the kind of reliable , articulate conservative justice they think the Republican nominee would like .\nDespite no judicial experience , the quietly self-assured 46-year-old Iowa native has earned praise as a dazzling attorney arguing a range of big cases before the high court -- including health care and immigration reform .\nSome conservative legal advocates want more assurances of Clement 's conservative bona fides , hoping he and other young Republican lawyers would first be named to a federal appeals court seat -- a stepping stone perhaps to the high court .\n`` Clearly he 's a brilliant man . He 's clearly a wonderful [ oral ] advocate , '' said Severino . `` But I think particularly for a Supreme Court spot , you 're going to want to see somebody who has judicial experience , to see how they actually perform as a judge . ...
