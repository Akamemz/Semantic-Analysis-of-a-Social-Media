    "content": "That WTO week in Seattle twenty years ago was exhilarating . It felt like extraordinary events were happening and a new left politics had been born . Maybe after all the defeats of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 first Reagan leading the class war from above , then Clinton consolidating capital \u2019 s gains \u2014 things were turning . During a rally outside the city jail , where a few hundred protesters were kept on ice \u2014 the first place I ever heard the chant \u201c this is what democracy looks like \u201d \u2014 fellow boomer Marc Cooper of the Nation said to me , \u201c They \u2019 re smarter than we were. \u201d I had to agree , though in retrospect I \u2019 m not clear on just why .\nI went because I thought it would be interesting but had no idea what to expect . I fell in with Cooper , John Nichols ( then of Capital Times ) , and Peter Rothberg of the Nation , and we wandered around together , wrote it up for the magazine , and reported on it for its radio show . I also roamed around doing daily photojournalism .\nThe occasion for the counter-gathering was a ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization . The WTO had been founded five years earlier , to replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . As their names suggest , GATT was a loose framework for periodic trade negotiations , known as rounds , which were named after the city they opened in . With the neoliberal exuberance characteristic of the mid-1990s , the WTO was created as a formal body with powers to adjudicate trade disputes according to principles established during those rounds .\nActivists overestimated the WTO \u2019 s sway . As the Columbia economist and militant free-trader Jagdish Bhagwati told Liza Featherstone and me in an interview a couple of years later , the organization \u2019 s entire budget was smaller than the IMF \u2019 s travel budget , which should give you an idea of the two institutions \u2019 relative importance . But it nonetheless served as something of a home address for global capitalism , which despite the boom of the late 1990s was in some disrepute , and so activists decided to disrupt the ministerial .\nGoing into the meeting , member countries were deeply divided over many issues \u2014 not just the rich nations against poor , but also within the rich and poor delegations . Much of the work that should have been done in advance of the conference , so that assembled bigwigs could just formalize deals already made by lower-level diplomats , wasn \u2019 t done because of all that internal conflict . So , while the protests cut the meeting short , it \u2019 s not like there was a great momentum interrupted .\nBut to be safe , the WTO scheduled its next major meeting for Doha , a site where riots seemed highly improbable , two years later . That 2001 meeting opened a trade round that continues to this day because no one can agree on anything still .\nSeattle was often read as semi-spontaneous , but it took months of hard organizing to make it happen . There were several axes among the organizers . There were NGOs like the Naderite Public Citizen , whose Michael Dolan was a key figure ; Global Exchange ; the International Forum on Globalization ( IFG ) ; and mainstream enviro groups like Friends of the Earth . More radically , there were activist/anarchist groups , like the Direct Action Network ( DAN ) , The Ruckus Society , and Earth First ! .\nOrganized labor shed , at least briefly , some of its usual caution , and put a lot of bodies on the scene , some of whom split off from the official proceedings and joined the troublemakers . There was a strong presence of representatives from the Global South , who denounced the WTO as an imperialist enterprise \u2014 which it is , though not like the IMF . WTO is based on a one-country , one-vote principle ; the IMF , on a one-dollar ( or equivalent ) , one-vote principle . That more democratic voting structure is the major reason for the last twenty years of stalemated trade negotiations .\nI arrived on Monday , November 29 and went to NGO headquarters , where I met Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 , the French farmer who \u2019 d pulled the roof of a McDonald \u2019 s off with his tractor a few weeks earlier , and snapped a picture of his contraband cheese , which was subjected to punitive tariffs as part of a US trade war with the European Union . Bov\u00e9 had roused a crowd outside a McDonald \u2019 s with a speech against Monsanto and GMO , which then broke the restaurant \u2019 s windows . The Battle of Seattle , as it came to be known , was characterized by the bourgeois media as violent and destructive , but there was little of that . Those reports seem more driven by the ideological bruising capitalism itself was taking , which elites had been unaccustomed to for the previous couple of decades .\nTuesday brought a giant labor rally . Organized labor had , at least for this event , shunned the nationalist rhetoric of old in favor of international labor solidarity . A South African mineworker quoted Marx by name , urging the workers of the world to unite \u2014 to a great cheer from the crowd . There were jingoistic bleats from some Steelworkers and Teamsters , but it was largely contained .\nBut later on , organized labor split away from the march that was supposed to block the delegates from assembling , leaving the task to the serious militants . The reason for this cowardly move , as Jeffrey St. Clair reported at the time : \u201c [ Labor ] would get a Wednesday meeting with Bill Clinton , with the promise that at future such WTO conclaves they would get \u2018 a seat at the table. \u2019 \u201d This tactic works all too often . As organizer and writer Bill Fletcher once told me , a labor higher-up disclosed to him that \u201c it \u2019 s better to have a seat at the table and not be listened to than be outside . \u201d\nTuesday was also the anarchists \u2019 star turn . In a memoir of Seattle week , DAN organizer Chris Dixon described the scene downtown : \u201c Looking around , there was a group of activist Santa Clauses , many returning sea turtles , a sprinkling of stilt-walkers , a jubilant squad of radical cheerleaders , a vast number of giant puppets , an anarchist marching band with matching pink gas masks , and thousands of ordinary people who looked very determined. \u201d Steelworkers marched with environmentalists , Lesbian Avengers with machinists .\nIt was a glorious moment . Anarchists chanted one of the great slogans of the late twentieth century : \u201c Capitalism ? No thanks ! / We will burn your fucking banks ! \u201d Reading this twenty years later is both thrilling and painful : it felt marvelous at the time , but it all led essentially nowhere .\nOn Wednesday , cops shut the city center down , but troublemakers were still able to make plenty of trouble . ( At the end of the week , I said to a trio of Seattle cops that I \u2019 m from New York and the NYPD would have shut things down hard . They admitted that was true because the NYPD knows crowd control and their force didn \u2019 t . ) The labor internationalism of a day earlier was forgotten as unions staged a \u201c tea party , \u201d in which they dumped loads of imported steel products \u2014 actually Styrofoam painted to look like steel \u2014 off a pier . Bored with the speechifying that accompanied the tossing of the steel , some union workers joined the direct-action crew heading downtown where they were all met with tear gas and rubber bullets .\nThings began winding down on Thursday . There was a modestly attended rally outside the city \u2019 s Labor Temple , where Nichols and I talked with a shirtless member of the Santa Cruz chapter of the Lesbian Avengers who said , \u201c When we got here , the Steelworkers weren \u2019 t very queer-friendly . As the week wore on , they got more comfortable with us . My nipples stand in solidarity with the Steelworkers and Teamsters and all the laboring people ! \u201d A locked-out Kaiser Aluminum worker standing near her said : \u201c A year ago I thought a redwood deck was the most beautiful thing in the world . Now I understand the importance of sustainability . I guess I \u2019 m an environmentalist now. \u201d There \u2019 s nothing like common struggle to forge alliances among the most apparently unlikely people .\nOn Friday , the ministerial meeting collapsed . It felt like we \u2019 d won , though you had to step back a lot from the collective high to ask yourself exactly what .\nDespite aspects of radicalism in the air , it was a hard time to be a socialist . Grand narratives were still deeply out of fashion . A few years before Seattle , the late organizer Joanne Landy confessed to me , feeling like she was in a safe space , \u201c I \u2019 ve been a socialist my whole adult life but I \u2019 m afraid to say the word aloud. \u201d Seattle didn \u2019 t change that .\nThe Seattle-era left was heavy with philanthropists and the NGOs they funded . Critiques of capitalism were largely over size and style , never critiques of capitalism as a social system . \u201c Globalization \u201d was identified as the major problem , a word that always sounded like a euphemism for capitalism and imperialism , but those concepts were shunned as hopelessly antique . If you pointed out the euphemizing , you were red-baited .\nThe old and homey ways of doing things were mourned . Despite the presence of people from all over the world , no one thought much about internationalism from the left .\nThat was the drift of the quasi-official counter-events . To the left of those events were anarchists , many of them anti-capitalist , but the refusal to talk about a new system was embedded in the \u201c anti- \u201d prefix . But it must be acknowledged that the meeting wouldn \u2019 t have been shut down without them .\nIn a reflection on the state of the movement in the Nation , published six months after Seattle , Naomi Klein celebrated its protean qualities \u2014 centerless , mobile , flexible . In the parlance of the time , it wasn \u2019 t a movement , but a movement of movements . As Klein put it , \u201c these campaigns have not coalesced into a single movement . Rather , they are intricately and tightly linked to one another , much as \u2018 hotlinks \u2019 connect their websites on the Internet. \u201d ( We used to capitalize \u201c Internet. \u201d ) \u201c [ T ] he communication technology that facilitates these campaigns is shaping the movement in its own image , \u201d she declared . No hierarchies and minimal organization were the gospel of the time .\nKlein briefly wandered into some worries that the movements would devolve into little more than serial protest , endless attempts to replicate Seattle , which itself was a climax of the previous four or five years \u2019 of demos at various economic summits around the world . The seriality was underscored by the convention of naming them after the first letter of the month and date : J18 ( the June 18 , 1999 Carnival Against Capital at the G7 summit in Germany ) , N30 ( Seattle ) , A16 ( the April 16 , 2000 demonstrations against the World Bank and IMF ) , the forthcoming S26 ( September 26 , 2000 demonstrations in Prague , also against the World Bank and IMF ) .\nThe movements were starting to look , Klein lamented , like Grateful Dead groupies following the band around , only instead of a hippie jam band , they were trailing finance ministers and trade negotiators . They left \u201c no trace behind , save for an archived website . \u201d\nBut having raised this bit of disquiet , Klein moves away from it and back to celebrating the grand ad-hoc-ness of it all . What is needed is not stodgy , old organizations , with their tedious hierarchies , and certainly not ideologies , \u201c like Marxism , democratic socialism , deep ecology , or social anarchy \u2014 on which they all agree . That is absolutely true , and for this we should be extraordinarily thankful . \u201d\nBut the serial protests continued , still with few traces beyond their archived websites . Then came 9/11 . In a show of ruling class solidarity , the World Economic Forum held its annual meeting in New York the following January instead of its usual location in Davos .

But there is more ambition to ask big systemic questions now than ten or twenty years ago , and more interest in building organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America that can last beyond the counter-meeting or the park occupation .\nWe have a Left , much of it proudly socialist , that is willing to engage with the state by running for office , and one that doesn \u2019 t see a necessary contradiction between electoral and non-electoral work .
