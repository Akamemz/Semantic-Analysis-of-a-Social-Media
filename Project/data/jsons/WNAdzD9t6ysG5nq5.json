But he was met with a blast from Rep , Jim McGovern ( D-Mass . ) , who said backroom deals had been made to \u201c gut \u201d the nutrition title in the months ahead .\nPowerful cotton , rice , peanut and sugar cane interests were working with the GOP to round up votes . But the two leading agriculture groups \u2014 the American Farm Bureau Federation and National Farmers Union \u2014 came out strongly against the GOP strategy , which breaks with nearly a half-century of practice in farm bills .\nA fresh 608-page text was filed only Wednesday evening , minus Title IV covering nutrition programs including food stamps and local food banks . Amendments adopted in last month \u2019 s farm debate are wrapped into the new measure .
