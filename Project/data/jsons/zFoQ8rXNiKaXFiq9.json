The jubilant crowd swelled to thousands as the night wore on .\n`` A new page in our long history is opening tonight . I want it to be one of hope and renewed confidence , '' Macron said . The 39-year-old investment banker became the youngest president in the 59-year-history of the French Fifth Republic with his victory .\nThe result amounted to an emphatic rejection of Le Pen 's `` French-first nationalism . '' The 48-year-old had hoped the same populist wave that led Donald Trump to the White House would also carry her to the Elysee Palace .\nMacron , in a solemn televised victory speech , vowed to heal the social divisions exposed by France 's acrimonious election campaign and bring `` hope and renewed confidence '' to his country .\n`` I know the divisions in our nation that led some to extreme votes . I respect them , '' he declared , unsmiling . `` I know the anger , the anxiety , the doubts that a large number of you also expressed . It is my responsibility to hear them . ''\nMacron 's victory marked the third time in six months -- following elections in Austria and the Netherlands -- that European voters shot down far-right populists who wanted to restore borders across Europe . The election of a French president who championed European unity could also strengthen the EU 's hand in its complex divorce proceedings with Britain .\nAfter his initial televised speech , Macron took a motorcade to join the party at the Louvre , passing Parisians who had lined the streets outside his campaign headquarters . The European anthem `` Ode to Joy '' played as Macron strode out to address his supporters .\n`` France has won ! '' he said . `` Everyone said it was impossible . But they did not know France ! ''\nSaying Le Pen voters backed her because they were angry , he vowed : `` I will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes . ''\nMany French voters had backed Macron reluctantly and with the sole goal of keeping out Le Pen and her National Front party , which has a long anti-Semitic and racist history .\nAfter the most closely watched and unpredictable French presidential campaign in recent memory , many voters rejected the runoff choices altogether . Pollsters projected that French voters cast blank or spoiled ballots in record numbers Sunday .\nCongratulatory messages poured in from abroad . Trump tweeted congratulations on what he called Macron 's `` big win '' and said he looked forward to working with the French leader . Macron has said he wants continued intelligence-sharing with the United States and cooperation at the United Nations and hopes to persuade Trump not to pull the U.S. out of a global accord fighting climate change .\nGermany 's foreign minister , Sigmar Gabriel , laced his welcome for Macron with a warning to the French , saying : `` If he fails , in five years Mrs . Le Pen will be president and the European project will go to the dogs . ''\nUntil now , modern France had been governed either by the Socialists or the conservatives . Both Macron and Le Pen upended that right-left tradition .\n`` France has sent an incredible message to itself , to Europe and the world , '' said Macron ally Francois Bayrou , tipped among his possible choices for prime minister .\nUnknown to voters before his turbulent 2014-16 tenure as France 's pro-business economy minister , Macron took a giant gamble by quitting Socialist President Francois Hollande 's government to run as an independent in his first campaign .\nHis startup political movement -- optimistically named `` En Marche ! ( Forward ) '' -- caught fire in just one year , harnessing voters ' hunger for new faces and new ideas .\n`` I 'm so happy , it feels so good ! I lived the election of Donald Trump in New York , and now finally , after Brexit , after Trump , populism has been beaten in France , '' said Pierre-Yves Colinet , a joyous Macron supporter at the Louvre victory party . `` Today , I 'm proud to be French . ''\nDespite her loss , Le Pen 's advancement to the runoff for the first time marked a personal and political breakthrough and underscored a growing acceptance of her fierce anti-immigration , platform .

Le Pen said her `` historic and massive '' score turned her party into `` the leading opposition force against the new president 's plans . ''\n`` I call on all patriots to join us , '' Le Pen said . `` France will need you more than ever in the months ahead . ''\nHer supporters at a National Front election night gathering in Paris put on a brave face .\n`` Now we enter combat , '' said Didier Roxel , a National Front legislative candidate .\nLe Pen said she got 11 million votes .
