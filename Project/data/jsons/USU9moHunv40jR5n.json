The trend line for Trump has gone downward in that regard since December , when 59 % of registered women voters had a negative view of him .\nBut for all the women who have voiced their collective disapproval in polling numbers , those closest to the billionaire businessman insist he 's a model husband and father -- supportive , nurturing , and empowering .\nSome women who have worked for Trump offer a similar assessment : Despite his controversial public comments , he is a giving and inspirational boss , they say , and treats female employees no differently than their male counterparts .\nStill , it is difficult to paint a full portrait of Trump 's dealings with women , because many who have worked with him over the years have no interest in talking publicly about a candidate who has shown no hesitation in striking back at his critics .\nA number of Trump 's former female colleagues contacted by CNN did not return calls .

''\nHe recalled his mom as `` smart as hell '' and as `` a really great homemaker and wife to my father . ''\nHe came to see his mother 's supporting role as a model not just for his own situation , but for any man who wants to succeed .\n`` For a man to be successful he needs support at home , just like my father had from my mother , not someone who is always griping and bitching , '' he wrote . `` When a man has to endure a woman who is not supportive and complains constantly about his not being home enough or not being attentive enough , he will not be very successful unless he is able to cut the cord . ''\nThe passage did not explore the possibility of a woman as the family 's primary wage-earner .\nTrump wrote that his `` big mistake '' with his first wife , Ivana , was `` taking her out of the role of wife and allowing her to run one of my casinos in Atlantic City , then the Plaza hotel . ''\nShe did an excellent job at both , he wrote , but once she took on those roles `` work was all she wanted to talk about . ''\n`` I will never again give a wife responsibility within my business , '' Trump wrote . `` Ivana worked very hard , and I appreciate the effort , but I soon began to realize that I was married to a business person rather than a wife .

MUST WATCH Dan Quayle : GOP needs to unite around Trump 02:52\nBut Trump has repeatedly stumbled into controversy with his asides about women over the past year , and his approval numbers among women have spiraled downward .\nThe Republican Party was already facing a deficit among women voters . In 2012 , Barack Obama led Mitt Romney among female voters by about 11 points -- with a particularly steep deficit among single women . ( Romney beat Obama by 7 points among married women , who have generally viewed the GOP more favorably ) .\nIn a March Quinnipiac University poll , 60 % of women said they would not vote for Trump in a general election -- a reflection of his poor approval ratings among women in a wide variety of national polls .\nHis campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , predicted Trump 's image among women would improve as the campaign progressed . His aides have pointed out that he trounced his rivals among Republican women in recent GOP primaries , including Pennsylvania , Maryland and Connecticut ( though that is hardly a good measure of how he would fare in a general election ) .\nJUST WATCHED Female Trump supporter : He 'has respect for women ' Replay More Videos ...

They vote on competency -- and that competency includes making sure that the nation is secure , which Donald Trump has pledged he will do , making sure we do n't have illegal immigrants pouring across the border , and making sure individuals have opportunities for jobs .\n`` Those are the things that cut across socio-economic status , they cut across gender , they cut across race . ''\nBeyond focusing on those broad themes , however , Trump has done little to try to shore up his weaknesses among women voters .\nHis various stumbles have n't helped . He angered both abortion-rights supporters and opponents , for example , when he said during an MSNBC town hall that women who have abortions should be punished if the procedure is outlawed\u2014and then quickly reversed himself .\nHis personal critiques of women 's looks on the campaign trail have been pointed .\nThat exchange seemed tame compared to his taunts of Heidi Cruz .

''\nTrump insisted the press stirred up the controversy . `` The media is so after me on women , '' the real estate magnate tweeted on March 26 . `` Wow , this is a tough business . Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump . ''\nBut female voters seem increasingly skeptical as Trump prepares to take on Hillary Clinton , who is running to be the first female president .\nSome women who have worked for Trump say they find it difficult to reconcile some of his statements and written opinions with the way he treated them .\nJUST WATCHED Mr. Trump goes to Washington Replay More Videos ...

''\nShe said Trump ran the office as a meritocracy and was refreshingly unconcerned about educational pedigrees .\nThough she went to work for Trump at the relatively young age of 30 , she said he put her on projects that challenged her and forced her to grow .\n`` He 'd say , ` I believe in you . I 'm gon na give you this -- now go run with it , '' Cremer recalled .\nCremer said Trump has made some cringe-worthy public comments involving women over the years , but she said he never talked that way to her or in her presence .\n`` I do n't know how to explain it , '' she said . `` But , when you 're on the inside , it 's different . ''\nLili Amini , who manages Trump 's golf club in Palos Verdes , offered a similar description of her billionaire boss .\nAmini , who was identified by a Trump campaign aide as a female employee who could talk about his management style , said she met Trump in 2005 when she accompanied her father to work at the sprawling resort overlooking the Pacific Ocean . Her parents owned a flower business and maintained the plants and flowers at the Trump facility .\nShe was 27 at the time and studying to be a buyer in the fashion world .\nShe said Trump walked up and asked her father : `` Who 's this ? ''\nHe introduced his daughter and the two struck up a conversation . By the end of it , Amini recalled , Trump told her : `` I want you to work here . ''\nShe said she did n't know anything about running a food and beverage operation at the time , and did n't even know what job she was being offered . But after discussing the offer with her parents she decided it was too good to pass up .\nShe started out as the small events coordinator and , with Trump 's mentoring and support , has worked her way to general manager .\nShe said Trump would periodically show up at the resort and each time he did would encourage her to learn everything she could about some new aspect of the business .\nHe was always encouraging , she said , and always professional . He taught her , she said , to never doubt herself . `` He 's been a great motivator , '' she said . `` Impossible is never a word that I use in my vocabulary . ''\nAmini said Trump never made her feel like she got the job because she was a woman or that she was being second-guessed based on her gender after she rose through the ranks .\n`` It 's just about the work , '' she said . `` It 's always about the work . ''\nTrump received more mixed reviews from Barbara Res , who worked for Trump from 1978 to 1996 and helped oversee the construction of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue .\nRes said she had good working relationship with Trump and that it was an unusual move for him to hire her in 1978 , because there were so few women working in the construction industry .\nBut Res , who wrote about her experiences in her book , All Alone on the 68th Floor : How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction , said Trump became less approachable and accessible over time .\nIn an essay for the New York Daily News , Res wrote that Trump was `` nasty to the people who work for him , '' that he could `` be very abusive and curt '' and had an `` incredible temper ... he lashes out at everyone . ''\n`` Of all the people I know who worked for or with Trump , including contractors , lawyers , architects , employees , only a very few actually like him , '' Res wrote in the New York Daily News . `` Some respect him , some do n't . Many hate his guts . ''\nBut she said he had a good eye for talent , and had several strong women working for him in her heyday . He told her she was `` a killer '' and that wanting to be liked by her subordinates was a weakness .\n`` Later , he would hire and promote many people with questionable qualifications , '' Res wrote in her New York Daily News essay . `` I could see , over time , his growing need to be coddled and agreed with , '' she wrote , adding that by the 1980s , he `` had taken to decorating his office with beautiful women . ''\n`` He changed , '' Res said in a telephone interview . `` I think it was fame and fortune , absolutely . ''\nIn his book , Trump wrote : `` I do n't know why , but I seem to bring out either the best or worst in women . ''\nHe reiterated that `` they 're really a lot different than portrayed , '' and `` far worse than men , far more aggressive . ''\nHe praised their intelligence and said they should be saluted for their `` tremendous power , which most men are afraid to admit they have . ''",

MUST WATCH Dan Quayle: GOP needs to unite around Trump 02:52\n\nBut Trump has repeatedly stumbled into controversy with his asides about women over the past year, and his approval numbers among women have spiraled downward.\n\nThe Republican Party was already facing a deficit among women voters. In 2012, Barack Obama led Mitt Romney among female voters by about 11 points -- with a particularly steep deficit among single women. (Romney beat Obama by 7 points among married women, who have generally viewed the GOP more favorably).\n\nIn a March Quinnipiac University poll, 60% of women said they would not vote for Trump in a general election -- a reflection of his poor approval ratings among women in a wide variety of national polls.\n\nHis campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, predicted Trump's image among women would improve as the campaign progressed. His aides have pointed out that he trounced his rivals among Republican women in recent GOP primaries, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and Connecticut (though that is hardly a good measure of how he would fare in a general election).\n\nJUST WATCHED Female Trump supporter: He 'has respect for women' Replay More Videos ...

They vote on competency -- and that competency includes making sure that the nation is secure, which Donald Trump has pledged he will do, making sure we don't have illegal immigrants pouring across the border, and making sure individuals have opportunities for jobs.\n\n\"Those are the things that cut across socio-economic status, they cut across gender, they cut across race.\"\n\nBeyond focusing on those broad themes, however, Trump has done little to try to shore up his weaknesses among women voters.\n\nTrump on the attack\n\nHis various stumbles haven't helped. He angered both abortion-rights supporters and opponents, for example, when he said during an MSNBC town hall that women who have abortions should be punished if the procedure is outlawed\u2014and then quickly reversed himself.\n\nHis personal critiques of women's looks on the campaign trail have been pointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat exchange seemed tame compared to his taunts of Heidi Cruz.

Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut female voters seem increasingly skeptical as Trump prepares to take on Hillary Clinton, who is running to be the first female president.\n\nNurturing talent in the workplace\n\nSome women who have worked for Trump say they find it difficult to reconcile some of his statements and written opinions with the way he treated them.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mr. Trump goes to Washington Replay More Videos ...

I'm gonna give you this -- now go run with it,\" Cremer recalled.\n\n\"And I did it,\" she said.\n\nCremer said Trump has made some cringe-worthy public comments involving women over the years, but she said he never talked that way to her or in her presence.\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it,\" she said. \"But, when you're on the inside, it's different.\"\n\nLili Amini, who manages Trump's golf club in Palos Verdes, offered a similar description of her billionaire boss.\n\nAmini, who was identified by a Trump campaign aide as a female employee who could talk about his management style, said she met Trump in 2005 when she accompanied her father to work at the sprawling resort overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Her parents owned a flower business and maintained the plants and flowers at the Trump facility.\n\nShe was 27 at the time and studying to be a buyer in the fashion world.\n\nShe said Trump walked up and asked her father: \"Who's this?\"\n\nHe introduced his daughter and the two struck up a conversation. By the end of it, Amini recalled, Trump told her: \"I want you to work here.\"\n\nShe said she didn't know anything about running a food and beverage operation at the time, and didn't even know what job she was being offered. But after discussing the offer with her parents she decided it was too good to pass up.\n\nShe started out as the small events coordinator and, with Trump's mentoring and support, has worked her way to general manager.\n\nShe said Trump would periodically show up at the resort and each time he did would encourage her to learn everything she could about some new aspect of the business.\n\nHe was always encouraging, she said, and always professional. He taught her, she said, to never doubt herself. \"He's been a great motivator,\" she said. \"Impossible is never a word that I use in my vocabulary.\"\n\nAmini said Trump never made her feel like she got the job because she was a woman or that she was being second-guessed based on her gender after she rose through the ranks.\n\n\"It's just about the work,\" she said. \"It's always about the work.\"\n\nMixed reviews\n\nTrump received more mixed reviews from Barbara Res, who worked for Trump from 1978 to 1996 and helped oversee the construction of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.\n\nRes said she had good working relationship with Trump and that it was an unusual move for him to hire her in 1978, because there were so few women working in the construction industry.\n\nBut Res, who wrote about her experiences in her book, All Alone on the 68th Floor: How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction, said Trump became less approachable and accessible over time.\n\nIn an essay for the New York Daily News, Res wrote that Trump was \"nasty to the people who work for him,\" that he could \"be very abusive and curt\" and had an \"incredible temper ... he lashes out at everyone.\"\n\n\"Of all the people I know who worked for or with Trump, including contractors, lawyers, architects, employees, only a very few actually like him,\" Res wrote in the New York Daily News. \"Some respect him, some don't. Many hate his guts.\"\n\nBut she said he had a good eye for talent, and had several strong women working for him in her heyday. He told her she was \"a killer\" and that wanting to be liked by her subordinates was a weakness.\n\n\"Later, he would hire and promote many people with questionable qualifications,\" Res wrote in her New York Daily News essay. \"I could see, over time, his growing need to be coddled and agreed with,\" she wrote, adding that by the 1980s, he \"had taken to decorating his office with beautiful women.\"\n\n\"He changed,\" Res said in a telephone interview. \"I think it was fame and fortune, absolutely.\"\n\nIn his book, Trump wrote: \"I don't know why, but I seem to bring out either the best or worst in women.\"\n\nHe reiterated that \"they're really a lot different than portrayed,\" and \"far worse than men, far more aggressive.\"\n\nHe praised their intelligence and said they should be saluted for their \"tremendous power, which most men are afraid to admit they have.\"",
