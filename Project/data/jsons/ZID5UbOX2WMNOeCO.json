But getting to their next destination leaves them on their own .\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement , or ICE , has said that it does not want to put children in detention centers and it does not want to split up families . ICE releases those families with the condition that they contact ICE for their next court date once they reach their destination in this country .\nBut last weekend ICE dropped more people at the downtown Greyhound station than there were seats on the buses .\nWednesday afternoon a government van dropped a group of people at the bus station . ICE said that last weekend as many as 400 were left there over the past few days , and that many of them had been stopped in south Texas .\nThe families , which are from Mexico and Central America , after they are released , contact those who were waiting for them in this country . But sometimes the time is too late to get help from those contacts for a bus ticket .

CBP did not have a formal explanation as to why south Texas detainees are being transferred to Tucson . One could be available later this week .\nAs previously reported here , ICE is also helping to deliver children to illegals already living in the U.S. and has been complicit in cartel human trafficking of minors according to court documents .\nAccording to a court order obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the Department of Homeland Security is enabling cartel trafficking of minors , delivering those minors to illegals living inside the United States and completing criminal transactions for illegal immigrants .\nEssentially , illegal immigrants living in the United States are paying human traffickers connected to Mexican cartels to smuggle their children into the U.S .

It 's a well thought out strategy : get the kids over the border , the U.S. wo n't deport them because they fall under current DREAMer policies and then eventually , parents of those kids will also be able to live in the U.S. illegally because ICE does n't want to `` break up families .
