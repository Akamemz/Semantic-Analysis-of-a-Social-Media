That will be taken up separately .\nWill House Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio also blink , and bring the clean bill \u2013 expected to pass the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote \u2013 to the floor ? Such a move would put him at odds with many in his caucus , and possibly prompt a challenge to his leadership .\nAs weeks of struggle over DHS funding have shown , Republican control of both chambers doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean smooth sailing for the GOP . Even when the two leaders agree on policy \u2013 as they do in this case \u2013 they work under very different conditions , with each chamber having its own political climate and ways of doing things .\nMajority leader McConnell for instance , faces the unique challenge of the filibuster \u2013 the Senate blocking device that requires 60 votes to overcome . With Republicans holding 54 seats , he needs at least six Democrats to pass any controversial legislation , an incentive for at least a minimally bipartisan approach .\nHe also has 24 senators up for reelection in 2016 \u2013 several of them from blue states . That encourages political flexibility . Most GOP House seats , on the other hand , are secure in gerrymandered districts and red states . That promotes rigidity .\n\u201c McConnell has his own challenge . Having won a majority , and a bigger one than he expected , he still has a challenge in holding it . And holding it means showing he can govern and providing some protection for senators who are up in Ohio , in Pennsylvania , in New Hampshire , \u201d says Norman Ornstein , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .\nHouse Republicans , on the other hand , \u201c dominate \u201d in states such as Mississippi , Alabama , Oklahoma , Louisiana , and Texas , Mr. Ornstein points out . \u201c These individual House districts are themselves homogeneous echo chambers . \u201d\nYou can hear the difference when talking with Republicans from these two worlds . Republican Sen. Mark Kirk is up for reelection in Illinois , which Obama easily won in 2012 and 2008 . He was an early supporter of a \u201c clean \u201d bill to fully fund DHS without the immigration riders .

John Fleming ( R ) of Louisiana holds the opposite view .
