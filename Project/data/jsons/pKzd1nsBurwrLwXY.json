Democrats agreed with Charles Krauthammer\u2019s conclusion that the administration\u2019s \u201cPlan B\u201d is \u201cessentially nationalizing healthcare.\u201d\n\nDiscussion of who is actually covered under ObamaCare drew increased viewer participation. Democrats disagreed that the Jan. 1 deadline for new policies to start under ObamaCare may not be met.

Which is exactly where we are now.\u201d The question saw viewer votes spike to 28,000 per minute. Nearly 200,000 viewer panelists participated in Friday\u2019s debate.
