They 've voted to repeal the law over and over again , but have never reached a consensus on a single plan to replace it .

Because a `` replace '' plan would neutralize what has proved to be one of their best , and relatedly most disingenuous , lines of attack against the law since it passed in 2010 .\nWe know the outrage Republicans are expressing on behalf of people receiving cancellation notices from their individual market insurance plans is phony because it 's obviously phony . They do n't have any particular interest in ameliorating this phenomenon short of repealing or destroying the rest of the law .
