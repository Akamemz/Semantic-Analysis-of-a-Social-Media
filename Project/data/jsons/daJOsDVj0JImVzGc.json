For more newsletters , check out our newsletters page Subscribe\nWith the bill \u2019 s text still not released for public view , \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked GOP senators to explain their hopes for it . Who will benefit from the legislation ? What problems is this bill trying to solve ?\n\u201c All of them , \u201d Sen. John McCain said in an interview , not an uncharacteristic response of his Republican Senate colleagues .\nOver the course of the past week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked eight Republican senators to explain the affirmative case for the bill . They rarely answered directly , at least not on the bill \u2019 s policy merits .\nSometimes a senator could identify a desired outcome , like \u201c lowering premiums \u201d or \u201c stabilizing marketplaces. \u201d But they rarely could explain the mechanism through which they planned on achieving that outcome .\nHow will Republicans lower premiums ? \u201c It \u2019 s working together and coming up with a bill that does do that , \u201d Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas said . What tool will bring stability to Obamacare \u2019 s volatile exchanges ? \u201c By bringing certainty to the insurance market , \u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said . What new policy will lead tax cuts to lower premiums ? \u201c It \u2019 s teetering because the exchanges are failing , \u201d Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi explained .\nRead for yourself . Here are the transcripts of our eight interviews with Republican senators .\nMcCain on the problems this bill is trying to solve : \u201c They \u2019 re trying to get to 51 votes \u201d\nClarification : Upon reviewing the recording , McCain cut me off before the full question was out . We have included brackets to clarify what was not in the recording .\nGenerally , what are the big problems this bill is trying to solve ?\nAlmost all of them . They \u2019 re trying to get to 51 votes .\nPolicy-wise . What are the problems [ in the American health care system ] this is trying to solve \u2014 and is the bill doing that right now ?\nWell , it 's whether you have full repeal , whether you have partial repeal , whether you have the basis of it . It 's spread all over .\nBut based on the specifics of the bill you have heard so far , is it solving the problems [ in the health care system ] ?\nWhat I hear is that we have not reached consensus . That \u2019 s what everybody knows .\nRight , but outside of getting the votes . From what you hear of the actual legislation being written , is it solving the problems you see \u2014\nBut generally speaking , what are the big problems it is trying to solve ?\nYou name it . Everything from the repeal caucus , which as you know , they have made their views very clear \u2014 Rand Paul , etc . And then there are the others on the other side of the spectrum that just want to make minor changes to the present system . There \u2019 s not consensus .\nSen. Chuck Grassley says the AHCA will bring certainty to the market because insurers will \u201c know what the government policy is \u201d\nI want to ask a very broad question : What do you think this health care bill will accomplish that will improve America ? What 's the positive case for this bill ?\nWell , I can tell you what it 's going to do for Iowa . We are one of those states that in a couple of weeks if [ the insurer ] Medica pulls out , we 'll have 94 of our 95 counties wo n't have any insurance , even for people who have the subsidies . That 's what we have to concentrate on now .\nHow do you think the bill will fix that problem ?\nWell , by bringing certainty to the insurance market . They do n't have that certainty now .\nWell , they ca n't even file . They have to check the rates real high if they do n't know what the government policy is . And so the certainty is that passing a bill gives the health insurance companies certainty .\nNo , it ... well , yeah \u2014 it gives them certainty that you 'll have a lot higher rates than if you pass the bill .\nUm , if you 're talking about lowering the rates from now down , no . The rates could be way up here . [ Points to sky ] And if they \u2014 if we get a bill passed , it maybe would n't go up or would go up a heck of a lot less than they would without a bill .\nSen. John Boozman on the mechanisms to bring down premiums : \u201c It \u2019 s working together and coming up with a bill that does do that \u201d\nWhat do you think this health care bill will accomplish ? How will it help people in America with their health insurance ?\nWell , right now when I go back to Arkansas \u2014 we \u2019 ve got so many people in Arkansas , premiums have gone up 128 percent in the past four years . We have all kinds of people in a situation where if they \u2019 re fortunate enough to afford the premium , they \u2019 ve got $ 5 [ ,000 ] to $ 10,000 deductibles . And so hopefully we \u2019 ll deal with some of those problems\nWell , it makes it such that it \u2019 s more affordable . So that \u2019 s really what we \u2019 re working through now . We don \u2019 t have a bill yet ; we \u2019 re working hard to come to an agreement so we can solve some of those problems .\nWhy will this bill reduce premiums ? How will it lead to the outcome you \u2019 re describing ?\nWell , again , like I said , that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re working through here . I \u2019 m not going to negotiate the bill now . We \u2019 re in a situation where that is the outcome .\nI know that the course we \u2019 re going down is simply not sustainable . The other problem we \u2019 ve got is that premiums were held down through the election ; the premiums , in my state , the increase will be at least 20 to 25 percent . That \u2019 s what the insurance commissioners are telling me . I think we \u2019 re on an unsustainable course .\nBut I \u2019 m curious why you believe this bill will fix that problem . What \u2019 s the mechanism for fixing it ?\nIt \u2019 s working together and coming up with a bill that does do that . Because we \u2019 re in a situation with Obamacare that , again , we don \u2019 t have a sustainable product .\nI \u2019 m not going to argue with you . Who do you represent ?\n\u2588\u2588\u2588-dot-com . It \u2019 s a website . I \u2019 m just trying to understand how the bill works . That \u2019 s it .\nWell , we don \u2019 t have a bill . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 re working on . The reason we \u2019 re working really hard to come up with a bill is to solve some of the problems of Obamacare .\nBecause of the problems I outlined , we have a lot of people in a situation with increased premiums , increased deductibles . If you \u2019 re an Arkansan , you have a $ 5,000 deductible , you really don \u2019 t have insurance . You have catastrophic insurance , and after that it \u2019 s not such that you don \u2019 t have everything paid for \u2014 it \u2019 s probably an 80-20 match after that . So these are real problems that affect real people . We \u2019 re trying to come up with a solution that makes things more affordable .\nWe come up with a bill , and then Health and Human Services \u2014 [ Secretary of Health and Human Services ] Dr. [ Tom ] Price is working hard \u2014 the bill that was written , Obamacare , the way it was written , they have a lot of flexibility . We \u2019 re looking for ways to put more flexibility in the system . We have a bunch of counties next year that simply won \u2019 t only not have limited competition ; they \u2019 re going to be in a situation where \u2026 there\u2026\nI know the bill isn \u2019 t done , but what do you think in the general Republican overhaul \u2014 what do you think Obamacare is doing right now that isn \u2019 t allowing these problems to be taken care of ? What is your hope for what the Republican bill will do to change the problem you \u2019 re identifying ?\nI think Obamacare , the problem with it is there is nothing in it to drive down and contain costs . That was the problem we had going into health care when we were trying to fix it , was affordability .\nAgain , that \u2019 s what we \u2019 re trying to work through . Identifying the solutions that will work .\nSen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi : the AHCA \u201c will encourage more freedom \u201d\nWhat do you think this health care bill would solve ?\nWhat do I think of the health care bill in general ?\nWhat problems do you think it would take care of in America ?\nIt will , well , encourage more freedom by eliminating mandates at the individual level and the employer . It will cut taxes . It will moderate prices for premiums and inject some competition that is sadly lacking . And it will save money . It will rescue a system that is teetering on the brink .\nHow will it rescue a system teetering on the brink ? Because you think the tax cuts will allow for premiums to come down ? How ?\nIt \u2019 s teetering because the exchanges are failing . They \u2019 re not acting as they were intended . And as a result , insurers are dropping out . There are counties with no option .\nI want to understand why you think the bill will help the marketplaces .\nFor the reasons I \u2019 m giving you . A very comprehensive answer , I think .\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is frustrated . \u201c I want greater access and lower costs . So far , I 'm not seeing that happen . \u201d\nWhat do you want this health care plan to achieve ?\nI want greater access and lower costs . So far , I 'm not seeing that happen .\nHow confident are you that the plan under discussion would do that , compared to Obamacare ?\nThis is the big issue as I 'm talking to folks back home . I continue to hear stories of great frustration . Increasing premium costs . Increasing share of deductibles . Decreasing access . They know what they do n't like .\nThey know what they do like . They do like the fact that they have gotten coverage for preexisting conditions . They do like the fact that they 're able to keep their kids on [ their insurance ] . There 's some positives and then some bad things .\nWhen you ask Alaskans about their stories and what they want , they need increased affordability . Because we are slammed in every category , with premiums and the cost of care . Everything . They wanted decreased costs , increased access .\nAre you seeing provisions in the plan that 's being discussed that would achieve that ?\nThe plan the House laid down does not help Alaska . It does not help decrease their costs , and it does not help increase their access .\nSo the question is whether or not what is being built on the Senate side is going to better reflect that . My hope is that it will .\nI ca n't show to my constituents back home anything concrete because we do n't have anything . We 've been talking about ideas . But for instance , if you are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion or even if you 're going to wind down Medicaid expansion , that 's not increasing access .\nI think the requirements that I 'm looking for and my constituents are asking for are pretty basic . My task is going to be to make sure that those basic asks are met .\nDo you have any specific metrics in mind ? How do you evaluate whether a plan is going to lower costs or increase access ?\nIt was pretty easy for the state to run the numbers under the House-passed bill .\nAs the president was quick to point out the other day , the situation in Alaska is that we 've seen a 203 percent increase in premiums . That speaks to the imperative of why you need to repeal and replace the [ Affordable Care Act ] .\nBut what needs to be shared is that if the House-passed bill were actually going to play , the increase to Alaskans , for a 50-year-old male earning $ 50,000 a year , he would see his premiums hike by 500 percent . So it 's all a matter of scale .\nI do n't know what it is that will actually come forward . This has been part of my frustration . What 's the Senate bill going to look like ? I do n't know .\nI 've got people calling my office , I 've got people coming online to protest . They 're saying , `` Do n't vote for this ! '' Well , what is this ? We do n't know what this is yet .\nI know some senators have tried to say you 're starting from scratch and building your own plan . But it seems like in a lot of important ways , the Senate is really just tinkering with and trying to rework the House plan .\nBut again , I do n't know that . Because none of us have actually seen language .\nIs it the framework of the House-passed bill and then we 're filling in our own details ? I do n't know . We just do n't know .\nMy constituents expect me to know , and if we had utilized the process that goes through a committee , I would be able to answer not only your questions but my constituents ' questions .\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas says \u201c the most important objective \u201d is to lower premiums\nStepping back , what is the most important thing for this bill to achieve ? How is it going to make things better ?\nThe most important objective in repealing Obamacare is to lower health insurance premiums .\nThe biggest reason so many millions of people are frustrated and angry with Obamacare is that it \u2019 s caused premiums to skyrocket , making health insurance unaffordable . That is a problem the federal government caused , and we need to fix that .\nDo you think you can lower premiums for everyone , though ? Because obviously there are some policies that could lower premiums for some people but might not for others .\nUnder Obamacare , the average family \u2019 s premiums have increased over $ 5,000 a year . Every week , when I go back to Texas , I hear from Texans who say , \u201c I can \u2019 t afford health insurance for my family. \u201d That is an enormous problem , and it is the direct legacy of the failed policy of Obamacare .\nSo the idea is that it needs to average out to a premium decrease , even if some people might see higher premiums ?\nWe should work toward giving consumers more choices , more options , more competition , and as a result lower prices that are more affordable .\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia says \u201c people are hurting here. \u201d Will GOP bill help ? \u201c That \u2019 s the goal . \u201d\nWhat do you want this bill to achieve , and how do you think it \u2019 s going to improve health care in America ?\nFirst of all , we \u2019 ve got to stabilize the market of the places that have no coverage for the individual market , whose premiums are skyrocketing , whose deductibles are through the roof . This is a real phenomenon . Somehow we \u2019 ve lost sight of the fact that people are hurting here , and if we don \u2019 t act relatively quickly , the whole system could collapse .\nSo how do you evaluate , what metrics do you use to evaluate whether it achieves that or not ?\nIt \u2019 s simple . It \u2019 s the affordability , protect people with preexisting conditions , protect people with Medicaid . Try to figure out the differences between the Medicaid expansion states and the ones that didn \u2019 t expand Medicaid . These are the same principles we \u2019 ve been talking about because they \u2019 re better principles than what the ACA is giving us .\nAre you confident that the Republican bill would do that in a way Obamacare has not ?\nRight . But do you feel confident that it actually will ?\nUnless I \u2019 m confident we can do that , I don \u2019 t know how we can move forward in good conscience .\nSen . Rob Portman of Ohio : \u201c I \u2019 m not suggesting premiums will go down , but they won \u2019 t go up as much \u201d\nTo step back a bit on this debate , what fundamental goal do you want this legislation to achieve ? How is it going to improve health care ?\nWe \u2019 ve got to fix a real problem , which is that the Affordable Care Act has not worked in a couple really fundamental respects . One is you do have insurers who simply can not operate in this market , so they \u2019 re pulling out and they \u2019 ve been losing money for some time and cost-shifting onto the employer-based plans and other private plans . So it \u2019 s already been a problem .\nNow they \u2019 re at the point where they feel as though they can \u2019 t make enough money to stay out of bankruptcy , so they \u2019 re leaving . My state just got hit with 20 of those counties , but other states have been dealing with this . So that \u2019 s obviously one of the big issues , and that \u2019 s because this thing is not structured properly .\nThe second , and a more fundamental one for everybody I represent , it \u2019 s the cost of health care . Premiums and copays and deductibles have skyrocketed compared to what was promised .\nYou guys have gone beyond stabilizing the market , into overhauling Medicaid , reworking the financial assistance . How confident are you that this plan will really achieve those goals ?\nI think we can help stabilize the market and have some impact on the cost increases . I \u2019 m not suggesting premiums will go down , but they won \u2019 t go up as much .\nOn Medicaid , you \u2019 re right , that \u2019 s a whole different issue . There was expansion in the ACA , but the Medicaid system itself continued as before . That \u2019 s a separate issue , which is where I \u2019 m focused , to make sure we aren \u2019 t pulling the rug out from under people .\nAre you an Obamacare enrollee interested in what happens next ?

We are one of those states that in a couple of weeks if [the insurer] Medica pulls out, we'll have 94 of our 95 counties won't have any insurance ,even for people who have the subsidies.

What certainty?\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nWhat?\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhat do you mean by certainty?\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nWell, they can't even file. They have to check the rates real high if they don't know what the government policy is. And so the certainty is that passing a bill gives the health insurance companies certainty.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWouldn't not passing a bill also do that?\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nNo, it ... well, yeah \u2014 it gives them certainty that you'll have a lot higher rates than if you pass the bill.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nSo you're saying [the bill] will lower the rates?\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nUm, if you're talking about lowering the rates from now down, no.

[Points to sky] And if they \u2014 if we get a bill passed, it maybe wouldn't go up or would go up a heck of a lot less than they would without a bill.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nBy \"rates,\" are you talking about premiums?\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nYeah, premiums. \u2026 I'm sorry I have to go.\n\nSen. John Boozman on the mechanisms to bring down premiums: \u201cIt\u2019s working together and coming up with a bill that does do that\u201d\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhat do you think this health care bill will accomplish? How will it help people in America with their health insurance?\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nWell, right now when I go back to Arkansas \u2014 we\u2019ve got so many people in Arkansas, premiums have gone up 128 percent in the past four years. We have all kinds of people in a situation where if they\u2019re fortunate enough to afford the premium, they\u2019ve got $5[,000] to $10,000 deductibles. And so hopefully we\u2019ll deal with some of those problems\n\nJeff Stein\n\nHow does this bill do that?\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nWell, it makes it such that it\u2019s more affordable. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re working through now. We don\u2019t have a bill yet; we\u2019re working hard to come to an agreement so we can solve some of those problems.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhy will this bill reduce premiums? How will it lead to the outcome you\u2019re describing?\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nWell, again, like I said, that\u2019s what we\u2019re working through here. I\u2019m not going to negotiate the bill now. We\u2019re in a situation where that is the outcome.\n\nI know that the course we\u2019re going down is simply not sustainable. The other problem we\u2019ve got is that premiums were held down through the election; the premiums, in my state, the increase will be at least 20 to 25 percent. That\u2019s what the insurance commissioners are telling me. I think we\u2019re on an unsustainable course.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nBut I\u2019m curious why you believe this bill will fix that problem. What\u2019s the mechanism for fixing it?\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nIt\u2019s working together and coming up with a bill that does do that. Because we\u2019re in a situation with Obamacare that, again, we don\u2019t have a sustainable product.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhy is cutting Medicaid necessary?\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nI\u2019m not going to argue with you. Who do you represent?\n\nJeff Stein\n\nVox-dot-com. It\u2019s a website. I\u2019m just trying to understand how the bill works. That\u2019s it.\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nWell, we don\u2019t have a bill. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. The reason we\u2019re working really hard to come up with a bill is to solve some of the problems of Obamacare.\n\nBecause of the problems I outlined, we have a lot of people in a situation with increased premiums, increased deductibles. If you\u2019re an Arkansan, you have a $5,000 deductible, you really don\u2019t have insurance. You have catastrophic insurance, and after that it\u2019s not such that you don\u2019t have everything paid for \u2014 it\u2019s probably an 80-20 match after that. So these are real problems that affect real people. We\u2019re trying to come up with a solution that makes things more affordable.\n\nWe come up with a bill, and then Health and Human Services \u2014 [Secretary of Health and Human Services] Dr. [Tom] Price is working hard \u2014 the bill that was written, Obamacare, the way it was written, they have a lot of flexibility. We\u2019re looking for ways to put more flexibility in the system. We have a bunch of counties next year that simply won\u2019t only not have limited competition; they\u2019re going to be in a situation where \u2026 there\u2026\n\nJeff Stein\n\nI know the bill isn\u2019t done, but what do you think in the general Republican overhaul \u2014 what do you think Obamacare is doing right now that isn\u2019t allowing these problems to be taken care of?

That was the problem we had going into health care when we were trying to fix it, was affordability.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nSo you think this will drive down costs. How?\n\nJohn Boozman\n\nAgain, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to work through. Identifying the solutions that will work.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi: the AHCA \u201cwill encourage more freedom\u201d\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhat do you think this health care bill would solve?\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nWhat do I think of the health care bill in general?\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhat problems do you think it would take care of in America?\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nOh, goodness. Well.\n\nIt will, well, encourage more freedom by eliminating mandates at the individual level and the employer. It will cut taxes. It will moderate prices for premiums and inject some competition that is sadly lacking. And it will save money. It will rescue a system that is teetering on the brink.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nHow will it rescue a system teetering on the brink? Because you think the tax cuts will allow for premiums to come down? How?\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nIt\u2019s teetering because the exchanges are failing. They\u2019re not acting as they were intended. And as a result, insurers are dropping out. There are counties with no option.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nI want to understand why you think the bill will help the marketplaces.\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nFor the reasons I\u2019m giving you. A very comprehensive answer, I think.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is frustrated. \u201cI want greater access and lower costs. So far, I'm not seeing that happen.\u201d\n\nDylan Scott, Vox\n\nWhat do you want this health care plan to achieve?\n\nLisa Murkowski\n\nI want greater access and lower costs. So far, I'm not seeing that happen.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nHow confident are you that the plan under discussion would do that, compared to Obamacare?\n\nLisa Murkowski\n\nThis is the big issue as I'm talking to folks back home. I continue to hear stories of great frustration. Increasing premium costs. Increasing share of deductibles. Decreasing access. They know what they don't like.\n\nThey know what they do like. They do like the fact that they have gotten coverage for preexisting conditions. They do like the fact that they're able to keep their kids on [their insurance]. There's some positives and then some bad things.\n\nWhen you ask Alaskans about their stories and what they want, they need increased affordability. Because we are slammed in every category, with premiums and the cost of care. Everything. They wanted decreased costs, increased access.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nAre you seeing provisions in the plan that's being discussed that would achieve that?\n\nLisa Murkowski\n\nThe plan the House laid down does not help Alaska. It does not help decrease their costs, and it does not help increase their access.\n\nSo the question is whether or not what is being built on the Senate side is going to better reflect that. My hope is that it will.\n\nI can't show to my constituents back home anything concrete because we don't have anything. We've been talking about ideas. But for instance, if you are going to eliminate Medicaid expansion or even if you're going to wind down Medicaid expansion, that's not increasing access.\n\nI think the requirements that I'm looking for and my constituents are asking for are pretty basic. My task is going to be to make sure that those basic asks are met.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nDo you have any specific metrics in mind? How do you evaluate whether a plan is going to lower costs or increase access?\n\nLisa Murkowski\n\nIt was pretty easy for the state to run the numbers under the House-passed bill.\n\nAs the president was quick to point out the other day, the situation in Alaska is that we've seen a 203 percent increase in premiums. That speaks to the imperative of why you need to repeal and replace the [Affordable Care Act].\n\nBut what needs to be shared is that if the House-passed bill were actually going to play, the increase to Alaskans, for a 50-year-old male earning $50,000 a year, he would see his premiums hike by 500 percent. So it's all a matter of scale.\n\nI don't know what it is that will actually come forward. This has been part of my frustration. What's the Senate bill going to look like? I don't know.\n\nI've got people calling my office, I've got people coming online to protest. They're saying, \"Don't vote for this!\" Well, what is this? We don't know what this is yet.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nI know some senators have tried to say you're starting from scratch and building your own plan. But it seems like in a lot of important ways, the Senate is really just tinkering with and trying to rework the House plan.\n\nLisa Murkowski\n\nBut again, I don't know that. Because none of us have actually seen language.\n\nIs it the framework of the House-passed bill and then we're filling in our own details? I don't know. We just don't know.\n\nMy constituents expect me to know, and if we had utilized the process that goes through a committee, I would be able to answer not only your questions but my constituents' questions.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas says \u201cthe most important objective\u201d is to lower premiums\n\nDylan Scott\n\nStepping back, what is the most important thing for this bill to achieve? How is it going to make things better?\n\nTed Cruz\n\nThe most important objective in repealing Obamacare is to lower health insurance premiums.\n\nThe biggest reason so many millions of people are frustrated and angry with Obamacare is that it\u2019s caused premiums to skyrocket, making health insurance unaffordable. That is a problem the federal government caused, and we need to fix that.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nDo you think you can lower premiums for everyone, though? Because obviously there are some policies that could lower premiums for some people but might not for others.\n\nTed Cruz\n\nUnder Obamacare, the average family\u2019s premiums have increased over $5,000 a year. Every week, when I go back to Texas, I hear from Texans who say, \u201cI can\u2019t afford health insurance for my family.\u201d That is an enormous problem, and it is the direct legacy of the failed policy of Obamacare.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nSo the idea is that it needs to average out to a premium decrease, even if some people might see higher premiums?\n\nTed Cruz\n\nWe should work toward giving consumers more choices, more options, more competition, and as a result lower prices that are more affordable.\n\nSen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia says \u201cpeople are hurting here.\u201d Will GOP bill help? \u201cThat\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\nDylan Scott\n\nWhat do you want this bill to achieve, and how do you think it\u2019s going to improve health care in America?\n\nShelley Moore Capito\n\nFirst of all, we\u2019ve got to stabilize the market of the places that have no coverage for the individual market, whose premiums are skyrocketing, whose deductibles are through the roof. This is a real phenomenon. Somehow we\u2019ve lost sight of the fact that people are hurting here, and if we don\u2019t act relatively quickly, the whole system could collapse.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nSo how do you evaluate, what metrics do you use to evaluate whether it achieves that or not?\n\nShelley Moore Capito\n\nIt\u2019s simple. It\u2019s the affordability, protect people with preexisting conditions, protect people with Medicaid. Try to figure out the differences between the Medicaid expansion states and the ones that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid. These are the same principles we\u2019ve been talking about because they\u2019re better principles than what the ACA is giving us.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nAre you confident that the Republican bill would do that in a way Obamacare has not?\n\nShelley Moore Capito\n\nThat\u2019s the goal.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nRight. But do you feel confident that it actually will?\n\nShelley Moore Capito\n\nUnless I\u2019m confident we can do that, I don\u2019t know how we can move forward in good conscience.\n\nSen. Rob Portman of Ohio: \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting premiums will go down, but they won\u2019t go up as much\u201d\n\nDylan Scott\n\nTo step back a bit on this debate, what fundamental goal do you want this legislation to achieve? How is it going to improve health care?\n\nRob Portman\n\nWe\u2019ve got to fix a real problem, which is that the Affordable Care Act has not worked in a couple really fundamental respects. One is you do have insurers who simply cannot operate in this market, so they\u2019re pulling out and they\u2019ve been losing money for some time and cost-shifting onto the employer-based plans and other private plans. So it\u2019s already been a problem.\n\nNow they\u2019re at the point where they feel as though they can\u2019t make enough money to stay out of bankruptcy, so they\u2019re leaving. My state just got hit with 20 of those counties, but other states have been dealing with this. So that\u2019s obviously one of the big issues, and that\u2019s because this thing is not structured properly.\n\nThe second, and a more fundamental one for everybody I represent, it\u2019s the cost of health care. Premiums and copays and deductibles have skyrocketed compared to what was promised.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nYou guys have gone beyond stabilizing the market, into overhauling Medicaid, reworking the financial assistance. How confident are you that this plan will really achieve those goals?\n\nRob Portman\n\nI think we can help stabilize the market and have some impact on the cost increases. I\u2019m not suggesting premiums will go down, but they won\u2019t go up as much.\n\nOn Medicaid, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s a whole different issue. There was expansion in the ACA, but the Medicaid system itself continued as before. That\u2019s a separate issue, which is where I\u2019m focused, to make sure we aren\u2019t pulling the rug out from under people.\n\nJoin the conversation\n\nAre you an Obamacare enrollee interested in what happens next?
