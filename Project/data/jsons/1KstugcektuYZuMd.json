    "content": "After months of waffling and reality show\u2013style intrigue , President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he \u2019 d decided to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement .\nIn a speech that was stunning in its deceptiveness , he argued the agreement is unfair to America , has damaged our economy , and will hasten other countries \u2019 theft of US jobs . \u201c This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States , \u201d he said . Of course , none of this is true .\nThe agreement is nonbinding and flexible . The 195 countries that signed have plenty of room to chart their own courses within it . The US , and every other country that \u2019 s party , can change its commitments if it deems them a burden . The agreement , rather than a \u201c legal liability \u201d per Trump , is an international partnership to solve humanity \u2019 s most dangerous long-term problem .\nWhile most countries are not yet on track to hit their commitments under the agreement , we are seeing a widespread resolve around the world to take responsibility for climate change and scale back greenhouse gas emissions . And the US and the world \u2019 s other leading emitters are likely to continue transitioning to cleaner energy regardless of the Paris accord . Trump may have even made others more determined to show leadership now that the US has decided it will not .\nBut Trump \u2019 s move is cruel in the message it sends about how America values the environment , how little it now cares about the risks climate change poses to the planet . And it \u2019 s likely to prove incredibly damaging to America \u2019 s strategic position in the world and its standing in international negotiations on a range of issues .\nHere are the winners and losers from this major event .\nThe US coal industry is collapsing \u2014 make no bones about it . But some coal companies , particularly ones operating in Kentucky and Wyoming , retain remarkable political influence and have long pushed Trump to exit the accord .\n`` This is a step to fulfilling some of the promises that he [ President Trump ] made , '' Tyler White , president of the Coal Association in Kentucky , told Fortune on Thursday .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 has explained in depth many times , there is no way Trump will be able to bring coal back , despite his claims to the contrary . Between 2011 and 2016 , US coal production dropped by 27 percent . The culprits , according to a report by the Columbia Center on Global Energy Policy , are :\nNatural gas : 49 percent Lower-than-expected demand : 26 percent Renewable energy : 18 percent Obama regulations : 3 to 5 percent\n( The Paris agreement , ahem , is not on the list . This is about markets . )\nSome coal companies are more in touch with the reality that they \u2019 re going to have to evolve past burning coal to stay in business , and the industry was reportedly divided on Paris . According to POLITICO , \u201c The top three U.S. coal producers \u2014 Peabody Energy , Arch Coal and Cloud Peak Energy \u2014 indicated ... that they would not publicly object to sticking with the international accord , particularly if the administration can secure more financial support for technology to reduce pollution from the use of coal , according to industry officials and sources close to the administration . \u201d\nBut coal company Murray Energy , and its friends at various conservative think tanks , helped convince Trump that Paris put the US \u201c at a very , very big economic disadvantage. \u201d So did the National Association of Manufacturers and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America , out of fears that their energy costs would increase . And according to Timmons Roberts at Brookings , in the past two weeks , the Competitive Enterprise Institute ran 70 ads against the agreement .\nBut the efforts to fight Paris will do very little for coal miners : Their lost jobs aren \u2019 t coming back , and their communities won \u2019 t be saved by the pullout .\nWhile the central storyline about the political figures who convinced Trump to pull out of Paris focused on Steve Bannon , Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt , and White House counsel Don McGahn \u2014 all known to have vigorously opposed the agreement \u2014 there \u2019 s a lot more to it .\nMany conservative and GOP leaders and influencers in Congress and the think tanks they listen to have also been pushing Trump hard to leave Paris . Twenty-two Republican senators , including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , sent a letter in May making a bogus argument that the US is could be sued if it doesn \u2019 t meet the Paris agreement \u2019 s emissions goals .\nAs \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Andrew Prokop writes , the Republican Party and the conservative movement have \u201c adopted a rock-solid , widespread consensus in opposition to any serious action aimed at US reducing carbon emissions . \u201d\nThere is a bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus . But as reporter Zack Colman found , there is really only lukewarm support for climate action among the Republicans on it . And this is the party that allowed Pruitt , a climate change denier and close pal of the oil and gas industry , to lead the EPA . With Paris , Trump stuck with the party line , and handed it a gleeful win .\nSo the US is no longer going to lead on climate change . That leaves other developed countries , and really China , to steer the ship . Like Europe , China has already emerged as a leader on green energy and technology . It \u2019 s expecting to reach its Paris target early .\nLately , Premier Li Keqiang , China \u2019 s second-in-command , has been pitching China , as Isaac Stone Fish writes for The Atlantic , as a \u201c liberal , responsible , globalist power , \u201d though it actually remains illiberal and authoritarian . The opportunity to step up on climate will help it reshape its image .\nConservatives have argued that Paris gave China and India an economic leg up on the United States , that their cheap coal puts US manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage . This is not accurate , but China does stand to emerge stronger in the realm of international diplomacy .\nLeading on climate may not come easy to China , however . \u201c There is still internal resistance in China by some powerful parties to policies cutting the use of coal and other fossil fuels , \u201d Edward Wong notes in the New York Times . \u201c Those interests include the state-owned energy companies . \u201d\nThe other irony here is that Trump has been fearmongering about losing to China for a long time . \u201c There are people who wish I wouldn \u2019 t refer to China as our enemy . But that \u2019 s exactly what they are , \u201d Trump wrote in his campaign manifesto \u201c Great Again : How To Fix Our Crippled America . \u201d\nTrump , no doubt , is feeling like a winner today after his big speech on Paris . But history suggests this decision is going to make him a loser . He may be unaware , or simply dismissive , of the repercussions . But they could very likely be severe , not just to his presidency but to US diplomacy and to US companies that want to do business overseas for years to come .\nAs Rebecca Leber at Mother Jones pointed out , the aftermath of the Bush administration \u2019 s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 , the last time we effectively shirked international responsibility on climate change , offers some clues as to the backlash that \u2019 s in store .\n`` We suffered through this issue over the years : drawing that early line in the sand helped to establish our reputation for 'unilateralism . ' We handled it badly , '' wrote then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in her 2011 memoir . Pulling out of Kyoto was a `` self-inflicted wound that could have been avoided . ''\nNational security experts today say they are worried about how the decision creates a \u201c strategic penalty \u201d that will damage US national security in a number of ways .\n\u201c This \u2018 strategic penalty \u2019 will come in terms of strained cooperation with our partners and allies who are dismayed and insulted by the move , as well as in terms of our strategic strength vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors and adversaries in the world , \u201d said Francesco Femia , co-president of the Center for Climate and Security , a security think tank . \u201c These competitors and adversaries will likely seize on this decision to expand their influence at our expense , whether that 's in the Asia-Pacific , the Arctic , the Middle East and North Africa , or anywhere else the US is engaged . It 's a blow to our leadership , and that will take time and great effort to recover from . \u201d\nThese are not things that Trump is apparently worried about \u2014 but they may very well affect people close to him , like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , in the near future . And more broadly , this move on Paris will be a stain on his presidency and could prevent his ability to do business and expand the Trump brand for years to come .\nAs part of the Paris agreement , developed countries -- which have generated the lion \u2019 s share of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change \u2014 reaffirmed that they would give $ 100 billion by 2020 to the Green Climate Fund , to assist developing countries with their climate policy and adapt to climate impacts . As of June 2017 , $ 10.3 billion had gone to the fund .\nIn his speech , Trump not only made clear that the US is done with the fund but also mocked it . \u201c The so-called green climate fund , nice name , \u201d is \u201c costing the United States a vast fortune , \u201d he said .\n\u201c In reality , the United States has contributed to date $ 1 billion out of a total pledge of $ 3 billion , \u201d writes Matthew J. Kotchen , a Yale professor who served on the governing board of the Green Climate Fund , in the Washington Post . \u201c Which is to say that what we \u2019 ve spent so far amounts to about .026 percent of the annual federal budget. \u201d ( Last year , President Obama contributed $ 500 million from the State Department \u2019 s budget . )\nPart of the point of the fund is to help the least developed countries most at risk of catastrophic global warming \u2014 and it \u2019 s currently supporting 43 projects in Eastern Europe , Latin America , the Caribbean , Africa and the Asian Pacific region . The threats to many countries in these regions are very real and very scary . Bangladesh , for instance , is looking at a major refugee crisis in the coming years as sea level rise displaces millions of people living in coastal flood zones .\nAnd we \u2019 re not just talking about people having to leave their homes because climate change will make them inhospitable or make it impossible to grow food or find water . The World Bank estimates climate effects could push 100 million people worldwide into poverty over the next 15 years .\nAs David Victor explained in a blog post for Brookings , Trump \u2019 s decision to withhold the additional promised contributions to the fund is a sign to developing countries \u201c that America is unreliable and that the benefits of staying engaged in climate negotiations are fleeting. \u201d We might also lose their good will for future negotiations . \u201c While these countries are generally not large greenhouse gas emitters , having their support is essential to making formal decisions \u2014 including adoption of the Paris agreement , \u201d Victor writes .\nMany of the biggest players in the US \u2014 including 69 Fortune 500 companies \u2014 saw the Paris agreement as a good deal for American enterprise . They sent letters and published ads in support of it . Their argument for Paris was that , as ConocoPhillips , one of the world \u2019 s largest oil companies , explained to Bloomberg : \u201c It gives the U.S. the ability to participate in future climate discussions to safeguard its economic and environmental best interests . \u201d\nBut even the CEO of Exxon Mobil , Darren Woods , who sent a letter to Trump in May advocating for the agreement , failed to sway him .\nNow a number of business titans are pissed off with the result . Here \u2019 s what the chairman and CEO of General Electric had to say :\nDisappointed with today \u2019 s decision on the Paris Agreement . Climate change is real . Industry must now lead and not depend on government . \u2014 Jeff Immelt ( @ JeffImmelt ) June 1 , 2017\nWithdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment , bad for the economy , and it puts our children 's ...

So now we have to ask : Will these corporations already committed to reducing emissions stick to those plans ? We \u2019 ll have to see if CEOs and investors will take up the challenge . Many are already signaling that they will .\nThe Paris agreement is not dead . In a statement Thursday , the European Union affirmed its commitment to the agreement , and to leading on climate change : \u201c The world can continue to count on Europe for global leadership in the fight against climate change . Europe will lead through ambitious climate policies and through continued support to the poor and vulnerable . \u201d\nBut losing the US is a serious blow \u2014 for how it could erode other countries \u2019 motivation to push hard for emissions reductions . Countries that are still fully committed will now have to worry more about the possibility that less committed countries may take this as an opportunity to slack off .\nAs Andrew Light of WRI has said , \u201c If the US pulls out altogether , the chances increase that developing countries like Brazil or India back away from their own commitments and say , \u2018 Why should we bother doing this if the world \u2019 s biggest historical emitter is completely out of the game now ? \u2019 \u201d\nUS participation in the Paris agreement wasn \u2019 t going to stop global warming from happening \u2014 the train has very much already left the station .
