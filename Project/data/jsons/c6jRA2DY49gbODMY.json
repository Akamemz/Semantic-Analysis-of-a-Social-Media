The night Jimmy Carter won the presidency , dad slept in the guest room . For the U.S. , the bitter campaign that ushered in Pres . Donald Trump in 2016 was a lot like that of 1976 in my house . Many families were politically divided , and the calendar forced the issue : The cherished American holiday Thanksgiving came just days after the election .\nAnecdotal reports suggest family feasts that year were less festive than usual , with many Americans struggling to sit across the table from relatives whom they knew had voted for a candidate they loathed . Now there is hard data showing political polarization caused quite a few people to skip the pie . A new study published this week in Science reveals families with mixed politics spent 20 to 50 minutes fewer at the table than politically like-minded groups . Even the amount of the difference was partisan : Republicans left earlier than Democrats ( some by more than an hour ) ; Democrats were more likely not to go at all . The effect was three times stronger in areas with heavy political advertising .
