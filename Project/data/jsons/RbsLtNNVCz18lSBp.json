Users tend to be younger and may not have lived through the first cycle of the story years ago .\n\u201c Old news is actually new news , \u201d GOP strategist Kevin Madden said .\n\u201c The stuff that happened 15 years ago is a window into how they arrived at this moment , \u201d Madden said of how the next generation of voters might find things newsworthy and help propel them to go viral . \u201c It \u2019 s a window into their resume and a window into the kind of person they are . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s also a sense among strategists that anything that happened before a platform existed is fair game . Twitter , for example , launched in 2006 and only became very popular in the last few years , making all kinds of old events relevant .\n\u201c If something is found now from the 80s or 90s , that could light a fire on social media very very quickly because it \u2019 s news now , \u201d said JD Chang , founder of TrendPo , a political analytics company that sells data on Twitter and Facebook to campaign and member offices .\nChang , who has done work for Republicans and Democrats , including Paul Ryan \u2019 s Prosperity PAC and South Carolina House candidate Tom Adams , points out the issue can apply to long-time politicians . \u201c Their history may not be covered by social media , certainly not their earlier histories , \u201d he said .\nThat makes dealing with this new environment especially challenging for senators considering reelection bids in 2016 \u2013 from Harry Reid to John McCain , whose last race in 2010 came at a time when Facebook was just starting to play in elections and Twitter was still a relatively niche platform .\nSocial media is also forcing old events to be held to current moral standards .

But not now . \u201c There \u2019 s an element of justice to what \u2019 s going on \u201d with Cosby , he said .
