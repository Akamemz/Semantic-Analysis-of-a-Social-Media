John Kerry , D-Mass. , who was tapped to replace Clinton at the department .\nOne issue that may come up is the department 's funding . Assertions that State Department posts are left vulnerable because Congress has decided not to fully fund security requests pervaded Wednesday 's hearings .\n`` Shame on the House for ... failing to adequately fund the administration 's request , '' Rep. Gregory Meeks , D-N.Y. , said\nDemocratic New York Rep. Eliot Engel repeatedly said Congress had `` slashed '' diplomatic security requests .\nClinton , in turn , affirmed their claims , saying budget issues are a `` bipartisan problem . ''\nBudget numbers , though , actually show the overall diplomatic security budget has ballooned over the past decade .\nDemocrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years , and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested . But Congress often scales back the administration 's requests , and not just for the State Department .\nAnd the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004 .\nFor that year , the budget was $ 640 million . It steadily climbed to $ 1.6 billion in fiscal 2010 . It dipped to $ 1.5 billion the following year and roughly $ 1.35 billion in fiscal 2012 -- still far more than it was a decade ago .\nIt 's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi . Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department 's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip , from $ 11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $ 10.1 million the following year .\nStill , then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue .\nAsked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force , she said : `` No . ''\nShe added : `` This was an unprecedented attack in size . '' Asked again about budget issues , Lamb said : `` Sir , if it 's a volatile situation , we will move assets to cover that . ''\nAsked Wednesday about Lamb 's testimony , Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role .\n`` That 's why you have an independent group like an ( Accountability Review Board ) ; that 's why it was created to look at everything , '' Clinton said .\nBut Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , R-Calif. , said `` any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base , or political . ''\nOther lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security .\nAnother pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable . That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a `` coordinated attack . ''\nThat cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack . But , to the dismay of lawmakers , Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it .\n`` That cable did not come to my attention . I have made it very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level , '' Clinton said . `` I 'm not aware of anyone within my office , within the secretary 's office , having seen the cable . ''\nRep. Michael McCaul , R-Texas , said `` somebody within your office should have seen this cable . ''\n`` An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself , warning of what could happen . And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office . That 's the bottom line , '' he said .\nClinton said it was `` very disappointing '' that `` inadequacies '' were found in the `` responsiveness of our team here in Washington , '' and said `` it 's something we 're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it does n't happen again .
