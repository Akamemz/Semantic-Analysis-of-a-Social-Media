''\nIt was vintage Obama , blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders .\nThere were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code , spend more to rebuild roads and bridges , bolster education and avoid war if at all possible .\nHe brought many to tears with a tribute to Sgt . First Class Cory Remsburg , a disabled war veteran who sat next to First Lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation .\nEven Republicans relentlessly critical of the President conceded his oratorical skill .\n`` A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex , '' said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos . `` The worst there ever was is still excellent . ''\nAccording to a snap CNN/ORC International poll , 44 % of respondents had a `` very positive '' response to Obama 's speech , while 32 % described a `` somewhat positive '' response and 22 % did n't like it at all .\nLast year , 53 % of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive .\nThe underlying theme of Obama 's fifth State of the Union address was his call for the government to work on behalf of all Americans in 2014 , and his pledge to do so even if Congress refused to join him in an election year .\n`` Let 's make this a year of action , '' Obama said . `` That 's what most Americans want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations .

''\nThe President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers . While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people , Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America .\nEarlier Tuesday , House Speaker John Boehner chafed at such unilateral action , telling reporters that Republicans are `` just not going to sit here and let the President trample all over us .

He cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits .\n`` The American people are n't interested in refighting old battles , '' Obama said . `` Let 's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that 's already helping millions of Americans . ... The first 40 were plenty . ... We all owe it to the American people to say what we 're for , not just what we 're against .

''\nEven as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits , Obama said average wages have been flat . Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts , Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $ 10.10 per hour .\nRepublicans largely oppose any federal increase , saying it will place a burden on employers .\n`` This is definitely the President 's agenda and has been for some time now , '' said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley , who added it was hard to see how Republicans would respond any differently than before and therefore , it was hard to see big things happening in 2014 .",

But CNN went in search of the unseen guests, the everyday Americans in the balconies for the State of the Union speech. Members of Congress can invite one guest each. These are some of the people they chose. We lead with Matt Cooke. During the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood, Cooke threw himself between attacker Nidal Hasan and a fellow soldier and was shot five times himself. A shy man who works to prevent military suicides, he struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder and sat near a House chamber door during the State of the Union in case of a panic attack. He said he attended the speech to fight for Fort Hood families and their push that the 2009 attack be considered a terrorist act.
