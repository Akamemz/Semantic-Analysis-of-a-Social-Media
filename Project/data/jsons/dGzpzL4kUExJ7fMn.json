But 16 % said the U.S. should `` do more '' to end the violence .\nThe desire to stay out of Egypt 's affairs might be connected to the fact that a majority of Americans feel what happens in the country is n't very important to U.S. interests .\nAccording to a Pew Research Center poll , 61 % of Americans say what happens in Egypt is somewhat important or not important , while 36 % say it is very important .\nBut ultimately , it 's up to Egyptians to find a peaceful resolution between the military-backed interim government and those who want Morsy back .\n`` The role the United States had tried to play as mediator between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood to try to find some kind of compromise is now moot , '' said Wright , the Middle East analyst . `` There 's not much the United States can do .
