But Trump did the right thing.\n\nCO2 is what we exhale. It's not a pollutant. It is, however, a greenhouse gas, and such gases increase global warming. It's possible that this will lead to a spiral of climate change that will destroy much of Earth!\n\nBut probably not. The science is definitely not settled.\n\nEither way, Obama's expensive regulation wouldn't make a discernible difference. By 2030\u2014if it met its goal\u2014it might cut global carbon emissions by 1 percent.\n\nThe Earth will not notice.\n\nHowever, people who pay for heat and electricity would notice. The Obama rule demanded power plants emit less CO2. Everyone would pay more\u2014for no useful reason.\n\nI say \"would\" because the Supreme Court put a \"stay\" on the regulation, saying there may be no authority for it.\n\nSo Trump proposes a sensible cut: He'll dump an Obama proposal that was already dumped by courts. He'd also reduce Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spending by 31 percent.\n\nGood!\n\nSome of what regulators do now resembles the work of sadists who like crushing people. In Idaho, Jack and Jill Barron tried to build a house on their own property. Jack got permission from his county. So they started building.\n\nThey got as far as the foundation when the EPA suddenly declared that the Barrons' property was a \"wetland.\"\n\nSome of their land was wet. But that was only because state government had not maintained its own land, adjacent to the Barrons' property, and water backed up from the state's land to the Barrons'.\n\nThe EPA suddenly said, \"You are building on a wetland!\" and filed criminal charges against them. Felonies. When government does that, most of us cringe and give up. It costs too much to fight the state. Government regulators seem to have unlimited time and nearly unlimited money.\n\nBut Jack was mad enough to fight. He spent $200,000 on his own lawyers.\n\nThree years later, a jury cleared Jack of all charges.\n\nBut even that didn't stop the EPA.\n\nJill Barron told me, \"We won, but after we were home for a month maybe, the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA sent us another letter saying, 'how nice for you that you won in the criminal court, but we still feel it's a wetlands.' And the decision made by the jury did not matter to them. 'And if you don't get off the property, we're going to fine you (in) civil (court).'\"\n\nThe EPA threatened a fine of $37,500 a day.\n\nThe Barrons sold their home and moved into a trailer.\n\n\"We'll be bankrupt, obviously.\" Jill told me, \"You have no idea what you're up against. You don't know the power that is the EPA.\"\n\nSo I'm glad that Trump wants to limit the EPA. Scott Pruitt, the agency's new director, understands that bureaucrats often abuse their power.

Can't have that.\n\nSo politicians keep adding unnecessary new rules and keep harassing people like the Barrons.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2017 BY JFS PRODUCTIONS INC.",
