Our goal has been , and will remain , # fullrepeal . ''\nDuring that interview , the Speaker also told Sawyer that comprehensive immigration reform is a top priority in his legislative agenda during the next Congress . Republicans within his conference , like Rep. John Fleming , were livid .\n`` I 'm concerned that Speaker Boehner is getting ahead of House Republicans when he commits to getting a 'comprehensive approach ' to immigration taken care of 'once and for all . ' There 's been zero discussion of this issue within the conference , and I 'm urging the Speaker to talk with House Republicans before making pledges on the national news , '' Fleming , R-La. , blasted in a statement . `` The Speaker needs to pull back on this issue and stop negotiating in public . ''\nAnd when Boehner tried last year to negotiate a grand bargain with Obama on the deficit , taxes and entitlements , key members of his party revolted at the notion that Boehner was open to new revenues .\nIn one of his last news conferences before the election , the Speaker said his failure to strike a grand bargain with the president was `` the biggest disappointment of my speakership . ''\nObama said Friday that new discussions will begin next week when Congress returns to begin the lame duck session .\nBoehner , who held a news conference Friday shortly before Obama , was cautious in his comments and offered few details on what he would accept in a deal , other than rejecting the suggestion of raising taxes on the top tier of tax payers .\nInstead , he said , `` This is an opportunity for the president to lead . This is his moment to engage the Congress and work towards a solution that can pass both chambers . ''\nWhen pressed on what was the size of deficit reduction package he envisioned , the speaker reiterated that he does not want to limit the scope of negotiations and once again called for Obama to lead .\n`` I do n't want to box myself in . I do n't want to box anybody else in , '' Boehner said .\n`` I do n't want to limit the options that would be available to me or limit the options that might be available to the White House , '' he said . `` There are a lot of ways to get there , and I do n't really want to preclude anyone who might have a good idea about how we move forward . ''\nBoehner 's immigration comment was also raised at his news conference Friday , but he was non-committal when asked if he was endorsing a pathway to citizenship .\n`` I 'm not talking about a 3,000-page bill , '' he said . `` What I 'm talking about is a common-sense , step-by-step approach that would secure our borders , allow us to enforce the laws and fix a broken immigration system , '' he said . `` I 'm not going to get into any of the details of how you would get there . It 's just time to get the job done . ''",
