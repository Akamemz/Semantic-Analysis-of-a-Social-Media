Often times , asylum seekers will cross illegally into the US awaiting to be found and processed by a border agent . More personnel between ports of entry may allow more visibility to catch these migrants once they 've crossed , but it 's unclear whether their presence will make them more likely to avoid crossing in the first place .\nIt 's also unclear whether the closure be limited to individuals crossing into and out of the US . If it includes cross-national trains and trucks importing and exporting goods with Latin America , a closure could pose a major threat to international commerce .\nRobert Perez , deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection , told `` CNN 's Right Now with Brianna Keilar '' on Friday that the closure of ports of entry would have `` pretty severe '' consequences .\n`` It 's Customs and Border Protection at every port of entry . Nearly 400 million travelers a year , $ 2.3 billion worth of trade , nearly 30 million trucks , rail cars and cargo containers every year , '' Perez said . `` And so , there ( will be ) a severe impact and this is important to understand because ... what is so important to understand is that the crisis is so severe right now , we are literally trying to save lives .

'' But he did n't close the border then .\nAnd last November , a major US-Mexico border crossing in San Diego was closed for hours after a group of hundreds of migrants on the Mexican side rushed the border area , leading US Border Patrol agents to fire tear gas at the group .\nThe President said at the time that `` if we find that it 's uncontrollable '' or it gets to a point where `` our people are going to start getting hurt , we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control .
