One Corbyn ally told the BBC opponents had been plotting a `` coup '' against the party 's leader for months .\nUnlike Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservatives , leader of the failed 'remain ' side in the British vote on EU membership , Corbyn has refused to resign .

She is the most senior member of his team to resign .\nEagle says the party needs a leader `` who can unite rather than divide '' the party .\nCorbyn has appointed lawmakers loyal to him to fill the vacated posts . He insists he will run in any new leadership contest , and says he has the support of the party 's grassroots .\nEuropean leaders stepped up the pressure on Britain to begin its complex exit from the 28-nation EU immediately , rather than wait several months as British Prime Minister David Cameron prefers .\nThe vote to leave sent the pound and global stock markets plunging . Britain 's Treasury said finance minister George Osborne would make an early morning statement Monday `` to provide reassurance about financial and economic stability '' before the London Stock Exchange reopens .\nThe leaders of the successful campaign to leave the EU stayed largely out of the public eye , as opponents accused them of lacking a plan to calm the crisis the result has triggered . In his first statement since Friday morning , `` leave '' leader and former London Mayor Boris Johnson used his column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper to urge unity and say `` the negative consequences ( of the vote ) are being wildly overdone . ''\nHe said Britain would forge `` a new and better relationship with the EU \u2014 based on free trade and partnership , rather than a federal system . ''\nThe vote , however , risks causing a political schism in the United Kingdom . Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would `` consider '' advising the Scottish Parliament to try to use its power to prevent Britain from actually leaving the EU .
