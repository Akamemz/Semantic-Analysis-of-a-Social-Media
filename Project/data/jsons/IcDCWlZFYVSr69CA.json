After a great deal of research , we moved from the East Coast to Colorado to escape the corrupted , dumbed-down curriculum of an overpriced private girls ' school .\nLife lesson : It 's not just government schools that are the problem . Many supposedly `` elite '' schools indulge in the senseless pedagogical fads that infect monopoly public schools .\nEvery family in America deserves maximized , customized choices in education .
