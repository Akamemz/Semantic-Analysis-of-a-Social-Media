By digging in their heels , the Clintons have only drawn more attention to the question : What , exactly , do you get when you pay a Clinton hundreds of thousands of dollars for an intimate , closed-to-the-press speech ?\nIn Bill Clinton \u2019 s case , it turns out , you get a dose of the full , unplugged Bubba .\nA transcript of a private , $ 285,000 paid speech Bill Clinton delivered last year at the \u201c China-U.S . Private Investment Summit \u201d in Austin , Texas , obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , offers a glimpse behind the curtain of the Clintons ' controversial paid speaking gigs \u2014 and some insight into how the former president holds court out of sight of the press .\n\u201c Once I got a cartoon in the mail when I was fighting out that Whitewater business , \u201d he reminisced in front of about 60 Chinese investors and 150 American business people gathered to discuss bilateral investment opportunities in late March 2015 \u2014 two weeks before Hillary Clinton officially declared her candidacy . \u201c And Jiang Zemin and I are sitting together at a state dinner , and in the first frame , I say to President Jiang , I said , \u2018 You know , you 're doing great economically , but our country has more human rights. \u2019 And he looked at me and he said , \u2018 Yes , and if you were the leader of China , Ken Starr would be in prison making running shoes . \u2019 \u201d\nA self-deprecating Clinton admitted of those scandal-tarred days of his presidency : \u201c I saved that cartoon for a long time . I must say there were days when I wondered who had the better model . \u201d\nBill Clinton has raked in close to $ 3 million in paid speeches since his wife launched her second bid for the White House last April , according to Hillary Clinton 's most recent financial disclosure . The enormous fee for the Texas speech \u2014 which took place when Hillary Clinton was already scouting campaign office space but had yet to officially announced her bid \u2014 signals just how much well-heeled clients are willing to pay to hear from a former , and potentially future , occupant of the White House .\nWaxing philosophical at one point , the former president mused : \u201c I learned that the weight , combined weight , of all the ants on Earth is greater than the combined weight of all the people on Earth . That \u2019 s sobering , \u201d Clinton said , quoting a fact from microbiologist E.O . Wilson \u2019 s book \u201c The Social Conquest of Earth , '' which he called \u201c the most important political book I have read in the last five years . \u201d\nHis long digression on insect life was to furnish a broader point about cooperation between nations . At one point , discussing world leaders he has respected , he said emotionally : \u201c I never loved another man more than I loved Yitzhak Rabin .

But the transcript of a private speech shows off a freer , looser Clinton than the one who has been trying to sell a candidate who is seen as the definition of status quo as `` the best change maker I 've ever known . ''\nThe Austin speech also suggests that Bill Clinton 's talents might best be used in a diplomatic capacity , rather than in a role designed to oversee economic domestic policy , as the Democratic front-runner recently suggested \u2014 which sparked criticism that she was leaning too much on her husband .\nIn the private speech in front of the conservative-leaning business group , Bill Clinton assumed a diplomatic tone discussing China , displaying a softer edge than his wife shows on the campaign trail , where she typically highlights security issues .\nHe touted the importance of investment opportunities in China , noting \u201c we all know what the problems are , but I want to talk to you about the opportunities and why I think it \u2019 s so important that you \u2019 re here. \u201d Extending an open hand , he added : \u201c It doesn \u2019 t bother me that we have differences of opinion . And we should not seek to abolish them or sweep them under the rug . We should instead become comfortable talking about them . \u201d\nThe former president did , however , acknowledge the detention last year of five Chinese women who tried to start a campaign against sexual harassment \u2014 which Hillary Clinton denounced on Twitter as an `` inexcusable '' act that `` must end . '' But he did so in less severe terms .\n\u201c I do think that it 's too bad these women have been arrested in the run up to the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Conference , \u201d he said . \u201c I think that there 's a way to be a strong country and tolerate dissent . \u201d\nHillary Clinton has a hawkish reputation when it comes to China \u2014 as secretary of state , she railed against Beijing \u2019 s \u201c deplorable \u201d human rights record and even questioned the future of the Chinese regime . But her campaign aides have also suggested China needs to be a partner to the United States in creating stability in Afghanistan . In his speech , Bill Clinton stuck to an upbeat pitch to investors as well as hope for a prosperous future between the superpowers .\n\u201c There may come a time when the U.S. and China will become involved in some irreconcilable conflict , as many pessimists believe , but it does n't have to happen if we work for the best and both plan for our security , \u201d he said . \u201c I think you can make a lot of money if you 're Chinese investing in America and I think you can make a lot of money if you 're American investing in China . ... I think the Chinese president is doing things that make sense . It 's a good time to invest there . \u201d\nHe emphasized that both sides need each other : \u201c It is very , very important to do what you are here to do . We need more Chinese investment in America , just like we need more American investment in China . ... Nobody is right all the time . Differences of opinion are healthy and debate is important , but it is really important to find a way for what we have in common to trump our interesting differences . \u201d\nStill , hiring Bill Clinton as a keynote speaker does n't mean he will limit himself to the specific topic of the conference .\nIn a Q & A following the speech , Clinton discussed at length the influence his great uncle had on him growing up , calling him \u201c the smartest person that I ever met in my own family . I believe his IQ was 180 or more . He had only six years of schooling , but he was breathtakingly brilliant . And in his old , old age he could remember the names of dogs he had owned 60 years earlier and things like that . \u201d\nThe former president said he credits his great uncle for teaching him his good people skills . \u201c I listened and I learned that every person has a story and that every person can be inherently interesting if they 're not too shy , or too scared , or too scripted , too controlled to block their own story , \u201d he said .\nClinton also seemed to forecast the divisive election cycle to come , where a brash and bullying candidate has managed to become one of the presumptive nominees .\n\u201c In our family when you were a child you could not tell a story until you proved you could listen to one , \u201d Bill Clinton said . \u201c And my aunt , my uncle , my grandparents , they would look at me and say , Bill , did you hear that ? And I 'd say , yes , I did . Did you understand it ? I think so . What did you hear ? And you would have to stand up and say what you heard . And I do n't think so much of that happens anymore . \u201d\nOf those listening skills , he said : `` I think that \u2019 s why I got elected president . ''",
