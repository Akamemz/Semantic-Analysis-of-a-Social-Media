I encourage you to read the full text of Trump \u2019 s speech and decide for yourself if it was \u201c the most hostile , dangerous \u2026 speech ever \u201d or if this is the worst reporting in the history of human civilization . Ever .\nThen there is John Haltiwanger \u2019 s article in Newsweek titled , \u201c Trump was laughed at by world leaders for dissing socialism . \u201d\nThis column caught my attention both for its content and lack of content . The title alone intrigued me\u2014as good titles are supposed to do\u2014but for all the wrong reasons . I mean , really ? I know we live in the age of 24/7/365 news cycles and the hunger for fresh web content is relentless , but has Newsweek sunk so low that an article that feels like dialogue lifted from the script of `` Mean Girls '' is now counted as serious journalism ?\nAs the title indicates , his critique of Trump \u2019 s speech centers on the president \u2019 s \u201c dissing \u201d of socialism . Haltiwanger writes :\nWhen President Donald Trump criticized socialism during his speech Tuesday at the United Nations , he seemed to expect roaring approval from the audience . Instead , world leaders responded with laughter and weak applause . It was perhaps the most awkward moment of Trump \u2019 s speech .\nSpeaking on the recent crisis in Venezuela , Trump said , \u201c The problem ... is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented . \u201d\n\u201c From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela , wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted , it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure , \u201d Trump added .\nIn the middle of his comments , Trump paused to take the room \u2019 s temperature , but it was apparent world leaders were unmoved by the rebuke of the worker state . The room was silent . It was reminiscent of Jeb Bush \u2019 s \u201c please clap \u201d moment\u2026 . Video of the [ president \u2019 s ] speech has immortalized the uncomfortable moment .\nThat Trump would do such a thing is , for Haltiwanger , evidence of the president \u2019 s buffoonery , lack of sophistication , and his failure to properly read \u201c the room \u2019 s temperature . \u201d\nHe includes a screenshot of a tweet from someone named Jordan , which reads , \u201c The # UNGA [ United Nations General Assembly ] just LAUGHED at Trump for criticizing socialism . \u201d\nI laughed at Mr. Haltiwanger \u2019 s article , but this is no proof that it is logically flawed ( though logically flawed it is ) . The Left has always been overly sensitive to what the world thinks of America and its president . They need global affirmation , it seems . Obama was , for them , urbane , glamorous , \u201c a gentleman , \u201d as an acquaintance at the New York Times has often characterized him to me , as if these are defining characteristics of great national leaders .\nBy contrast , Trump is , for them , a national embarrassment with his comb-over , trademark scowl , and unfashionable patriotism . How are we to stand toe-to-toe with France and Canada when they have socialist beefcakes like Macron and Trudeau ? Winston Churchill , who was neither a gentleman nor glamorous\u2014and whose scowl was likewise perpetual\u2014seems to have worked out rather well as Prime Minister . Moreover , Churchill biographer Paul Reid has said that Churchill , ever a reactionary , \u201c would out-tweet Trump . \u201d\nFurthermore , it is highly unlikely that Trump expected , as Haltiwanger maintains , \u201c roaring approval from the audience. \u201d According to a 2015 Freedom House study of 195 nations\u2014and , at the moment , there are precisely 195 nations in the world\u2014only 46 percent of them are deemed free . Worse , that same report says the world is trending away from freedom -- 193 of the countries included in this report are member states of the United Nations , North Korea and Venezuela among them . Trump \u201c seemed to expect roaring approval \u201d ? Please . Ann Coulter will sooner get applause at Berkeley than Trump before such an audience as this one .\nOf course , the reason the author tells us that UN \u201c leaders responded with laughter and weak applause \u201d is because he is , in the spirit of an adolescent , inviting us to join in the mockery and scorn of this president .\nMr. Haltiwanger , who is clearly infatuated with the undeliverable promises of socialism , concludes his argument with what he apparently thinks is his article \u2019 s mic-drop moment , proving once and for all that socialism works and that Trump is an idiot for thinking otherwise :\nMost industrialized countries , for example , have implemented universal health care . Moreover , Norway was recently ranked the happiest country in the world , and it pointed to its strong state-support programs as crucial to achieving this accolade\u2026 . Several other Scandinavian countries , including Denmark , Iceland and Sweden , were also among the top 10 happiest countries in the world , according to the most recent figures\u2026 . The U.S. , however , ca n't even make it into the top 10 happiest countries . It \u2019 s ranked at No . 14 .\nLet \u2019 s drill down on this a bit and the inference that socialism is the reason for it . Norway \u2019 s designation as the \u201c world \u2019 s happiest country \u201d is based on a United Nations report . You might think that this ranking comes from simple \u201c yes \u201d or \u201c no \u201d responses to the question , \u201c Are you happy ? \u201d It isn \u2019 t . That is essentially what Gallup did and guess who dominated the top ten ? Paraguay and Latin America . Neither Iceland nor a single Scandinavian country appeared in Gallup \u2019 s top ten .\nSo how did the guys at the UN produce entirely different results ? After spending an afternoon reading the UN report , that is still is unclear to me . This is because their study is 184 pages of abstruse data and reads like this :\nThe U.S. corruption index rose by 0.10 between 2006/7 and 2015/6 . With a coefficient -0.53 in the happiness regression , the negative effect on U.S. happiness is 0.054 . Reversing the rise in perceived corruption would therefore raise happiness by 0.054\u2026 .\nDrilling down still more , we find that this report , as with any UN report I \u2019 ve ever read , has a very definite political agenda . It concludes :\nTo escape this social quagmire , America \u2019 s happiness agenda should center on \u2026 an expanded social safety net , wealth taxes , and greater public financing of health and education\u2026 . [ A ] cknowledge and move past the fear created by 9/11 \u2026 Trump \u2019 s ban on travel to the United States from certain Muslim-majority countries is a continuing manifestation of the exaggerated and irrational fears that grip the nation .\nSo , from a haze of data on global happiness the report makes the illogical leap to America , Donald Trump , and the lack of \u201c a social safety net \u201d \u2014i.e. , lack of socialism\u2014as the sources of unhappiness ? They could have saved themselves time , money , and the clever use of dubious statistics and just interviewed Maxine Waters\u2014or Kim Jong Un .\nShould we really be surprised that the UN , the body that commissioned this report , didn \u2019 t like Trump \u2019 s speech ?\nAs for the myth that Iceland and Scandinavia are socialist utopias , it is interesting to note that these countries rank highest in the use of antidepressants . Iceland holds the top spot while Denmark , Sweden , and Norway are all in the top ten . It seems they rank high because they are , well , high .\nWhile speaking at Harvard \u2019 s Kennedy School of Government , Danish Prime Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen rejected the idea that his country is socialist even though it has a much larger social welfare system : \u201c I know that some people in the U.S. associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism . Therefore , I would like to make one thing clear . Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy . Denmark is a market economy . \u201d\nI am currently going around the world investigating the question of national greatness . In the last month , I have been in Japan , Singapore , and China . Traveling across Asia , you quickly discover that no one outside of Pyongyang has faith in the tenets of Marx and Lenin anymore . Not even China is truly socialistic . That is because they know socialism doesn \u2019 t work .\nNo , the people who believe in that na\u00efve , unworkable , utopian ideology no longer live in Beijing , Moscow , or Hanoi . On the contrary , socialism \u2019 s modern advocates reside in such places as London , Paris , Brussels , Berlin , and , increasingly , Washington .\nSince we are using happiness as an indicator of socialism \u2019 s emotional influence , let \u2019 s look at Gallup \u2019 s least happy country : Ukraine . I \u2019 ve spent a lot of time in that country . Indeed , I \u2019 ve written a book on it , and I can tell you that Ukraine has been economically , intellectually , and spiritually assassinated by socialism . Five more socialist ( or formerly socialist ) countries make Gallup \u2019 s bottom ten .\nTrump is right to say that \u201c wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted , it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure . \u201d\nThe failure of socialism is a wholly unjustified confidence in human government .
