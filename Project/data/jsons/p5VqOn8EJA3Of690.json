Outside of that , the highly publicized police shootings in Ferguson and North Charleston bear only mild resemblance .\nSo what 's changed between the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , in August , and that of Walter Scott in North Charleston , South Carolina , last weekend ? And did the backlash and publicity of the Ferguson shooting influence the handling of the North Charleston incident ?\nIt 's tough to say for sure , but here are some of the stark differences in the cases , the lessons learned by both police and the public , and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future .\nFerguson : Officer Darren Wilson said he shot Brown after the two struggled over Wilson 's gun , and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where Wilson was , where Brown was and whether Brown was surrendering or charging the officer .\nNorth Charleston : Though it 's unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it 's 100 % clear from the video that Scott was not posing a threat to Officer Michael Slager when the policeman opened fire on Scott as he ran away .\nTakeaway : Where Brown 's killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said Wilson was justified and those who said Brown was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the Scott shooting .\nIt would be tough to extrapolate for certain , but it 's possible that the clear-cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer , and that quick reaction by authorities in South Carolina after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in Ferguson as the process of determining Wilson 's fate dragged on for months .\nJUST WATCHED South Carolina police officer charged with murder Replay More Videos ...
