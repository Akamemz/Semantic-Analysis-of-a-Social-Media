He 's a one-man band with an impulsive , seat-of-the-pants management style . As his former rival Jeb Bush correctly predicted way back in the primaries , he 's the `` chaos candidate '' and now the `` chaos president . '' While it 's too soon to subscribe to some of the hyperventilating headlines about a `` crisis '' in the West Wing , there 's no doubt Trump 's has been the most chaotic start to any administration in modern times .\nHere are five questions about Trump 's extraordinary fourth week in office .\n1 . Has Trump done more in one month than any other president ?\nThis week started with Trump firing Mike Flynn , his national security adviser , after a news story that Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about what Flynn said to the Russian ambassador . ( Trump had known about that for almost two weeks and failed to inform Pence . ) The week ended with the news that the man Trump chose as his new national security adviser , retired Vice Adm. Robert Harward , had turned him down . Ouch . In between , there was the withdrawal of Trump 's nominee for labor secretary , and the announcement that three congressional committees were investigating repeated contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian intelligence \u2014 including during the time period when U.S. intelligence agencies say Russians were interfering in the U.S. election .\nThose were the big things . There was also a myriad of smaller controversies , like the repeated and false insistence by Trump that millions of people voted illegally for his opponent , and the fights he keeps picking with foreign leaders , intelligence agencies and department stores . Then there was a press conference for the ages , in which Trump insisted he was n't `` ranting and raving . I love this , '' he said . `` I 'm having a good time doing it . ''\nAnd there was one more thing . Gallup has Trump at a 38 percent approval rating , the lowest ever for a president this early in his term .\nTrump 's performance at his news conference \u2014 at times defensive , aggrieved , wheedling , frustrated and combative \u2014 thrilled his hardcore supporters . They love it when he takes on the press . By the end of the week he was tweeting that the media is `` the enemy of the American People . ''\nStill , Trump is losing some support . Gallup and Pew \u2014 two respected polls \u2014 have him around 40 percent approval or below . He 's holding steady with his core white non-college-educated supporters , but his support from white college-educated voters is down since Election Day . Those are the voters who voted for Trump even though they had reservations about his temperament and qualifications .\nThey were willing to give him a chance to disrupt the system because the system was n't working . But is this the kind of disruption they had in mind ? They wanted him to `` drain the swamp , '' vanquish ISIS , and above all , bring back jobs . But he 's been talking about Russians instead of renegotiating NAFTA ; promising to punish `` low-life leakers '' instead of proposing tax reform ; and fighting with the media instead of unveiling his infrastructure program .\nAfter Thursday 's news conference it was hard to find a congressional Republican who thought Trump has helped himself . Republicans have a very compartmentalized view of Trump . They love that after eight long years of Obama they finally have a president who will sign their bills . For that alone , they 're happy to ignore the tweeting , the obsession with his vote totals , and the flirting with Vladimir Putin . But if Trump 's approval ratings keep dropping to the point where he looks like he 'll be a drag on their re-elections , that forbearance might disappear .\nAlthough Republicans in Congress are intimidated by Trump 's tweets and his hardcore supporters \u2014 who make up a large share of the party 's base \u2014 Trump does n't have a real constituency on Capitol Hill the way Mike Pence does .

He's a one-man band with an impulsive, seat-of-the-pants management style. As his former rival Jeb Bush correctly predicted way back in the primaries, he's the \"chaos candidate\" and now the \"chaos president.\" While it's too soon to subscribe to some of the hyperventilating headlines about a \"crisis\" in the West Wing, there's no doubt Trump's has been the most chaotic start to any administration in modern times.\n\nHere are five questions about Trump's extraordinary fourth week in office.\n\n1. Has Trump done more in one month than any other president?\n\nMaybe \u2014 but not exactly the way he means.\n\nThis week started with Trump firing Mike Flynn, his national security adviser, after a news story that Flynn had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about what Flynn said to the Russian ambassador. (Trump had known about that for almost two weeks and failed to inform Pence.) The week ended with the news that the man Trump chose as his new national security adviser, retired Vice Adm.

There was also a myriad of smaller controversies, like the repeated and false insistence by Trump that millions of people voted illegally for his opponent, and the fights he keeps picking with foreign leaders, intelligence agencies and department stores. Then there was a press conference for the ages, in which Trump insisted he wasn't \"ranting and raving. I love this,\" he said. \"I'm having a good time doing it.\"\n\nAnd there was one more thing. Gallup has Trump at a 38 percent approval rating, the lowest ever for a president this early in his term.\n\n2. Is this what Trump voters wanted?\n\nTrump's performance at his news conference \u2014 at times defensive, aggrieved, wheedling, frustrated and combative \u2014 thrilled his hardcore supporters. They love it when he takes on the press. By the end of the week he was tweeting that the media is \"the enemy of the American People.\"\n\nStill, Trump is losing some support. Gallup and Pew \u2014 two respected polls \u2014 have him around 40 percent approval or below. He's holding steady with his core white non-college-educated supporters, but his support from white college-educated voters is down since Election Day. Those are the voters who voted for Trump even though they had reservations about his temperament and qualifications.\n\nThey were willing to give him a chance to disrupt the system because the system wasn't working. But is this the kind of disruption they had in mind? They wanted him to \"drain the swamp,\" vanquish ISIS, and above all, bring back jobs. But he's been talking about Russians instead of renegotiating NAFTA; promising to punish \"low-life leakers\" instead of proposing tax reform; and fighting with the media instead of unveiling his infrastructure program.\n\n3. Is this what Republicans on Capitol Hill wanted?\n\nNo.\n\nAfter Thursday's news conference it was hard to find a congressional Republican who thought Trump has helped himself. Republicans have a very compartmentalized view of Trump. They love that after eight long years of Obama they finally have a president who will sign their bills.

Stone told NBC there is \"a division between those who are loyal to the president and those who are loyal to the Republican National Committee,\" and has urged Priebus' firing.\n\n5. Can this ship be stabilized?\n\nOther administrations started chaotically, though probably not as dizzyingly as this one.\n\nBill Clinton had a famously rocky start but went on to pass NAFTA and welfare reform \u2014 and with the country at peace and prosperous, he won re-election.\n\nTrump has inherited a good economy that's improving by the day.
