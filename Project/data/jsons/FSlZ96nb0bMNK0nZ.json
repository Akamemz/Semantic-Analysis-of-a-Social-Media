Mitch McConnell in 2014 . But as a recent piece about the race in the Atlantic made clear , he still isn \u2019 t good . And while the voters of Kentucky are undoubtedly conservative , a look-over of Bevin \u2019 s political history reveals a man on the wrong side of the line separating \u201c hyper-conservative \u201d from \u201c radical fringe . \u201d\nBut he won , anyway . And despite what pre-election polls suggested , the outcome wasn \u2019 t even close .\nThis raises myriad questions for the Democratic Party , both in Kentucky and the nation as a whole . Most of those questions will center on the party \u2019 s get-out-the-vote apparatus , which increasingly seems to be useless for any election in which Barack Obama isn \u2019 t a candidate . In general , I chalk that up to the decline of organized labor . But Kentucky was never exactly Michigan . ( In fact , the state is something of an outlier recently when it comes to the nation \u2019 s larger de-unionization trend . )\nRegardless of unions \u2019 strength , though , Democrats had hoped that policy successes would inspire their constituents to come out and vote . Specifically , they hoped that Bevin \u2019 s vow to dismantle the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky ( as much as he can , that is ) would inspire the hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians who \u2019 ve benefited to vote for its protection . By almost any metric , after all , Kynect \u2014 what they call the ACA in Kentucky \u2014 has been an inspirational success .\nDemocrats hoped voters would reward the party for successfully implementing such a major policy . But from today \u2019 s vantage , it \u2019 s painfully obvious that they didn \u2019 t . And that \u2019 s not just a problem in the Bluegrass State \u2014 it \u2019 s a problem for all Democrats . Because one of the foundational assumptions behind Kynect , the ACA , and much of the entire Democratic Party agenda is that good policy makes for good politics . In Kentucky , at least , it didn \u2019 t .\nWhat does \u201c good policy = good politics \u201d mean ? It basically means that an effective program can survive , even if it \u2019 s unpopular at the outset . Those who benefit , the theory goes , will eventually become a constituency ( if they aren \u2019 t already ) and will organize to preserve it . Think of Social Security or Medicare : They weren \u2019 t necessarily super-popular when they were first implemented , but once people started relying on them , they became the so-called third rail of American politics .\nBut as left-wing critics of the Democratic consensus have long argued , there \u2019 s a problem with analogizing the ACA and Social Security . One of the programs is universal \u2014 everyone puts in ; everyone takes out \u2014 and the other isn \u2019 t . And this isn \u2019 t incidental . It \u2019 s the reason why so many Tea Party types will rail against \u201c handouts \u201d but cherish their Medicare . It \u2019 s because they believe they \u2019 re simply receiving what they \u2019 re owed ( they aren \u2019 t ) and that the benefits go to them instead of good-for-nothing moochers .\nThere are plenty of people in Kentucky right now who are better off because of the ACA . But many of them are beneficiaries of the law \u2019 s Medicaid expansion ( which Bevin has promised to change , if not revoke ) and thus lack political influence . And the rest ? As far as many of them know , it \u2019 s not the ACA or \u201c Obamacare \u201d that they now rely on . It \u2019 s Kynect . And Bevin didn \u2019 t campaign against Kynect .
