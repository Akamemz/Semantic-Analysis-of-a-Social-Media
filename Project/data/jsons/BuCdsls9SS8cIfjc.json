    "content": "BOULDER , Colorado \u2014 Desperate to stand out as time begins to run short , the Republican presidential candidates lashed out at one another Wednesday in their third presidential debate , with Ohio Gov . John Kasich and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush taking aim at the new generation of anti-establishment Republicans who have eclipsed them in the polls .\nThe 10 candidates on the stage in the evening main event panned the budget deal that Republican leaders on Capitol Hill reached with President Obama , saying it was a bad trade-off that called for more spending and debt now , matched with speculative promises of future cuts .\nThey also sparred over how deeply taxes and spending should be cut in the next administration , with Donald Trump and Ben Carson defending their expansive cutting plans and Mr. Kasich saying their numbers don \u2019 t add up .\nBut they found unity in attacking CNBC , which hosted the debate and seemed intent on reading opposition research attacks or orchestrating a food fight among the candidates .\nSen. Ted Cruz said the moderators were doing a disservice to the candidates by prodding them to insult one another rather than addressing the issues of interest to Republican voters .\n\u201c The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don \u2019 t trust the media , \u201d Mr. Cruz said instead of answering a question about the debt limit . \u201c This is not a cage match . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Republican debate reforms help set viewership records , throw race wide open\nMr. Cruz took issue with moderators over questions that the Texan said mocked Mr. Trump by asking if he was a \u201c comic book \u201d character , insinuated that Mr. Carson doesn \u2019 t understand math , and demanded that Marco Rubio give up his Senate seat .\n\u201c Nobody watching at home believes that any of the moderators has any intention of voting in a Republican primary , \u201d Mr. Cruz said .\nThe candidates repeatedly tried to bring the debate back to their own plans on tax cuts , entitlement programs and national security , but were sidetracked by the unwieldy size of the field and the chaotic format of the debate .\nMr. Trump plowed new ground when he said he would consider allowing employees at his business empire \u2019 s establishments to carry firearms , as he often does himself , saying gun-free zones have become targets for \u201c sickos . \u201d\n\u201c I think gun-free zones are a catastrophe , a feeding frenzy , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nMr. Carson reversed a position from earlier this year and said he now opposes government subsidies for ethanol , saying the government should stop picking winners and losers in business .\nBoth men , who are at top of the polls , were targets for Mr. Kasich , who is struggling for relevance and is stunned that anti-establishment candidates he considers unelectable are doing so well .\n\u201c My great concern is that we are on the verge , perhaps , of picking someone who can not do this job , \u201d he said , questioning Mr. Trump \u2019 s tax and immigration plans and Mr. Carson \u2019 s proposals on Medicare and Medicaid .\n\u201c The rate is going to be much closer to 15 percent , \u201d Mr. Carson said , defending the math on his tax plan . \u201c You also have to get rid of all of the deductions and all of the loopholes . You also have to do strategic cutting . \u201d\nMr. Trump said he would find a way to make Mexico pay for his border fence and would make the tax numbers add up , and then fired back at Mr. Kasich , saying he contributed to the Wall Street collapse as a member of the Lehman Brothers board \u2014 a claim Mr. Kasich denied .\nMr. Bush went after Mr. Rubio , a fellow Floridian who is competing for many of the same donors and who has risen as Mr. Bush has dropped , saying the senator is doing a disservice to voters in their home state by missing so many votes on Capitol Hill while running for president .\n\u201c Marco , when you signed up for this , this was a six-year term , \u201d he said . \u201c You should be showing up to work . I mean , literally , the Senate , what is it , like a French workweek ? You get like three days where you have to show up ? You can campaign or just resign and let someone else take the job . \u201d\nMr. Rubio eviscerated Mr. Bush , pointing out that he didn \u2019 t criticize Sen. John McCain when the 2008 Republican presidential nominee missed votes in the Senate .\n\u201c The only reason why you \u2019 re doing it now is because we \u2019 re running for the same position and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you , \u201d Mr. Rubio said . \u201c Here \u2019 s the bottom line : My campaign is going to be about the future of America , it \u2019 s not going to be about attacking anyone on this stage . \u201d\nThe candidates did delve somewhat deeply into their plans for entitlement reform . Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee defended the existing programs such as Social Security and said the government must find enough money to keep paying the benefits it has promised .\nMost of the rest of the field , however , said the government can not afford those promises , at least for future retirees , and changes have to be made .\nOther candidates later joined in the attacks on the moderators .\nMr. Rubio called them an example of how \u201c the Democrats have the ultimate super PAC \u2014 it is called the mainstream media. \u201d He and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie expressed incredulity at a question about fantasy-football regulation and told moderator John Harwood about his interrupting that \u201c even in New Jersey , what you \u2019 re doing is rude . \u201d\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , the Democratic presidential front-runner , took a page from Mr. Trump and tweeted responses during the debate \u2014 and took aim at Mr. Carson , a retired neurosurgeon , on his criticism of Obamacare and Medicare .\n\u201c For a surgeon , Ben Carson has a pretty poor diagnosis , \u201d she texted to supporters . \u201c We need to build on the progress we \u2019 ve made on health care . \u201d\nThe Republican field is beginning to shift after a relatively stable summer and early autumn .\nMr. Trump , who had consistently led in national and early-state polls , has seen Mr. Carson overtake him in the latest polls in Iowa , and in one new poll of the national Republican electorate .\n\u201c Iowa , will you get your numbers up , please ? \u201d Mr. Trump pleaded with voters in Sioux City , Iowa , on Tuesday . \u201c Will you get these numbers up ? I promise you , I will do such a good job . \u201d\nMr. Bush \u2019 s campaign has stumbled , forcing him to announce staffing cuts last week and to huddle with his family to try to plot another course . Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz have remained steady .\nCarly Fiorina , who surged after the first two debates , reaching double digits and third place , has fallen back to the middle of the pack .\nAlso on the main stage Wednesday were four candidates struggling to gain traction : Mr. Kasich , Mr. Huckabee , Mr. Christie and Sen. Rand Paul , who vowed to lead a filibuster in the Senate to try to stop the budget deal , which adds $ 80 billion in spending over the next two years , back-loading the cuts and savings until later in the debate , and granting the White House a debt holiday through March 2017 .\n\u201c It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money . I will stand firm . I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it , \u201d Mr. Paul said .\nEarlier in the night , four still lower-tier Republicans squared off in another \u201c kiddie \u2019 s table \u201d debate , with Sen. Lindsey Graham earning the best reviews for his shots at the Democratic field .\n\u201c Good God , look who we \u2019 re running against . The No . 1 candidate on the other side thought she was flat broke after her and her husband were in the White House for eight years . The No . 2 guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon , and I don \u2019 t think he ever came back , \u201d the South Carolina Republican said .\nHe then called for voters to put their top focus on national security .\n\u201c To the Chinese , when it comes to dealing with me , you \u2019 ve got a clenched fist or an open hand . You pick . The party \u2019 s over , to all the dictators , \u201d Mr. Graham said . \u201c Make me commander in chief , and this crap stops . \u201d\nFormer Sen. Rick Santorum broke with many other Republican by saying it was the right move to revive the Export-Import Bank , a New Deal-era program designed to provide credit to companies that can \u2019 t find it on the open market .\n\u201c There are 60 other Ex-Im banks all over the world . Every major competitor for the United States \u2019 manufacturing dollar has one of those banks , \u201d Mr. Santorum said . \u201c And guess what ? They use those banks a heck of a lot more than the United States of America does . So , in order to have a level playing field , which is what conservatives talk about all the time \u2026 then we have to have export financing . \u201d\nMeanwhile Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal and former New York Gov . George Pataki sparred over their fiscal records . Mr. Jindal said he cut the size of government while balancing budgets every year , and Mr. Pataki said he did that in New York with a Democrat-led legislature .\n\u201c You know , Bobby , you \u2019 re talking about your tax cuts ? I cut taxes more than everybody on this stage , more than everybody on the next stage , combined , \u201d he said .",
