    "content": "As the debate over gay marriage intensifies on the heels of President Obama 's endorsement , an under-the-radar case pending before the Supreme Court has the potential , some say , to invalidate traditional marriage laws altogether .\nThe latest ruling comes from the California-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , which said that Arizona 's recent attempt to strip health benefits for domestic partners of state workers is illegal .\nArizona moved in 2009 to take away the recently expanded benefit as part of an attempt to partially plug a $ 1.6 billion budget hole . Some gay workers countered that the savings were minimal -- no more than $ 2 million , according to one expert -- and that the law really targeted them . So they challenged it in court . And the court agreed .\nBut one veteran 9th Circuit judge thinks his colleagues have declared a war on marriage .\nThose judges `` all but expressly held that opposite-sex-only marriage rules are unconstitutional -- indeed , that such rules are irrational per se because they can rest only on a 'bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group , ' '' Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote in dissent of his court 's decision not to grant the case further review . He said his colleagues were ignoring Supreme Court precedent and all but called upon the high court to take the case . Arizona 's attorney general recently filed a brief with the justices asking them to accept O'Scannlain 's invitation .\nLawyer John Eastman , with the National Organization for Marriage , called the 9th Circuit ruling `` groundbreaking , '' and one that could render traditional marriage laws across the country `` unconstitutional '' if it takes hold .\nThose challenging the Arizona decision , though , called the state 's actions discriminatory .\n`` The legislature took aim at that system and dismantled it wholesale , '' lawyer Tara Borelli told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` There was nothing accidental or inadvertent about this . The legislature knew exactly what it was doing . And that 's what 's required to show that something is discriminatory . ''\nA trial court judge agreed and so did a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit on appellate review . Arizona officials then asked for another chance to make its case before the 9th Circuit , but that was denied without comment , prompting O'Scannlain 's blistering dissent .\nKeith Humphrey , an administrator at the University of Arizona in Tucson , said he was excited to learn that his partner , Robert , could be added to his employer-sponsored health plan . Then a year later , the state tried to take it away .\n`` I felt very disappointed when the state said my employment is worth less than someone who is married , '' Humphrey told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
