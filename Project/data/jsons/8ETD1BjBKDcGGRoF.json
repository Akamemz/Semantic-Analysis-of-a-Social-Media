Ferguson that enshrined \u201c separate but equal \u201d racial segregation . Such reexaminations of settled law require the ability for appeals courts to absorb evolving societal norms into the law . Florida \u2019 s court failed to show \u201c powerful reasons \u201d to reverse its 2016 decision , says Stephen Harper , director of the Death Penalty Clinic at Florida International University .\nA new conservative majority on Florida \u2019 s highest court has begun taking a shredder to seemingly settled rulings , in part of a national rollback of what conservatives see as liberal judicial activism . But the Florida Supreme Court \u2019 s decision to reverse its own 2016 decision on a death penalty case has caused chaos for inmates on death row . And it is highlighting a divide among conservatives on how rare the overturning of existing law should be .\nWhen the Florida Supreme Court ruled late last month that a unanimous jury is not required for the state to hand down a death sentence , the decision reverberated in the state prisons that house hundreds of felons already sentenced to death .\nThe legal wrangling over their fate overnight became \u201c chaos , \u201d says Marty McClain , a death-penalty lawyer .\nAfter all , only four years earlier , Florida had struck down the power of judges , not juries , to decide whether or not to execute convicted felons . That ruling followed a landmark U.S. Supreme Court finding that Florida \u2019 s system for capital sentencing was unconstitutional and led nearly 100 inmates on death row there to challenge their sentences .\nBut a new conservative majority on Florida \u2019 s highest court has begun taking a shredder to this and other seemingly settled rulings , part of a national rollback of what conservatives see as an era of liberal judicial activism . That ideological rollback is embodied in President Donald Trump \u2019 s appointment of 187 U.S. judges , including two to the Supreme Court , since 2017 . Under his watch , three U.S. appeals courts have flipped from liberal to more conservative majorities .\nIn its Jan. 23 verdict , the Florida Supreme Court said it had \u201c got it wrong \u201d in 2016 when it curbed the power of judges to effectively overrule split juries on capital cases . That case , Hurst v. State , was supposed to have a \u201c limited practical effect on the administration of the death penalty , \u201d Chief Justice Charles Canady wrote . But he said it had led to legal maneuvering that was undermining \u201c decades of settled Supreme Court and Florida precedent . \u201d\nCritics say the court \u2019 s abrupt reversal \u2013 the 2016 ruling was more than a decade in the making \u2013 has caused chaos for inmates on death row and attorneys like Mr. McClain . Some argue it violates the legal concept of stare decisis , which holds that rulings that overturn established law should be \u201c well thought-out and pretty rare , \u201d says Kenneth Williams , a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston .\nIn states that practice capital punishment , juries who find a suspect guilty are required to weigh the \u201c aggravating sentences \u201d and decide whether they justify execution or not . Florida \u2019 s twist on this safeguard is that judges aren \u2019 t bound by a jury \u2019 s advisory finding and can hold a separate hearing and decide that the death penalty is justified .\nThis power was struck down , however , in 2016 by the U.S. Supreme Court , which said in its decision that the Sixth Amendment \u201c requires a jury , not a judge , to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death . A jury \u2019 s mere recommendation is not enough . \u201d\nThis then led to Hurst v. State , in which the Florida Supreme Court set a new precedent for the state \u2019 s death-penalty system .\nThe new interpretation by Florida \u2019 s highest court serves to \u201c remove your friends and neighbors from the awesome power of the state to kill one of your neighbors , \u201d says Eric Freedman , a Hofstra University law professor .\nThe reason for the about-turn is the court \u2019 s makeup : Republican governors have replaced four of the justices who ruled on the 2016 case under Florida \u2019 s mandatory retirement law , tilting it to conservatives .\nWhether justified or not , the impulse in Florida to rewrite law as soon as a new court is seated shows how judges taking cues from national political tides \u2013 and the U.S. Supreme Court itself \u00ad\u2013 can affect lives in profound ways .\nThese are judges \u201c who have a very narrow interpretation of the Constitution and they will come out with really narrow decisions , \u201d says law professor Stephen Harper , director of the Death Penalty Clinic at Florida International University in Miami . \u201c That means the country is reverting to a much more conservative outlook and jurisprudence \u2013 more conservative than I think the public wants , or is . \u201d\nTo be sure , the U.S. legal landscape is littered with scrapped ideas . Rulings like Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) that enshrined \u201c separate but equal \u201d racial segregation and Bowers v. Hardwick ( 1986 ) that upheld a state law against homosexual acts have long been overturned . Such reexaminations of settled law require careful reading of the Constitution but also the ability for appeals courts to absorb evolving societal norms into the law .\nBy contrast , Florida \u2019 s reconstituted court took only a year or so to reverse the 2016 verdict and failed to show \u201c powerful reasons \u201d to do so , says Professor Harper , a former public defender in Miami-Dade County . The issues at hand were \u201c way too close . \u201d\nMr. Freedman agrees . \u201c There is nothing wrong with the concept that you want to reexamine old precedents to see if they make sense , \u201d he says . \u201c But does it make institutional , practical sense , both in terms of where we are now and where we are likely to be ? \u201d\nTo many conservative thinkers , the answer is yes . The Senate Republicans Communications Center tweeted \u201c Merry Christmas ! \u201d in applauding the latest wave of White House appointments to the federal bench in December .\nThese judges \u2019 extended terms mean the effects of their rulings could be felt for decades to come . But the impacts may not be as revolutionary as progressives fear , because conservative jurists don \u2019 t make up a monolith and , moreover , will be leery of upending established case law , say analysts .\nTake the Supreme Court : The four liberal justices tend to rule more as a pack than the other five . That suggests an awareness , says Mr. Freedman , that the power of the court comes in large part from its ability to project stability .\nMoreover , \u201c there is a split of thinking on [ the power of precedent ] in conservative circles , \u201d writes Brian Fitzpatrick , who studies judicial selection at Vanderbilt Law School in Nashville , in an email .\nThis divide is seen in the reasoning of late Justice Antonin Scalia , who \u201c thought that every day could not be a new day in the law , \u201d putting a strong emphasis on stare decisis , Mr. Fitzpatrick points out . Whereas \u201c people like Justice [ Clarence ] Thomas think it is wrong to prolong mistaken decisions \u2013 that his oath is to the Constitution , not to what his colleagues said about the Constitution . \u201d\nThis readiness to challenge precedent was seen last year when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned 40 years of labor law by making it illegal to force non-union workers to pay union fees . Meanwhile , states like Alabama and Georgia have passed laws intended to set up a challenge to the seminal Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion . Given that one Texas state judge has already ruled \u201c Obamacare \u201d unconstitutional , some progressives fear that conservatives hope to stack the courts in order to have the health care law overturned at the federal level .\n\u201c How can we order our lives if the law is constantly changing \u201d in a cavalier manner , asks Mr. Williams , the Houston law professor . \u201c If it becomes completely unpredictable , it becomes almost anarchy . \u201d\nFloridians , for one , are feeling the effects of a whipsaw state Supreme Court , says Daniel Goldberg , legal director at the Alliance for Justice , a progressive judicial advocacy group in Washington , D.C. Last year it blocked Miami Beach \u2019 s minimum wage ordinance on the grounds that it preempted state and federal authority to set a minimum wage .\n\u201c That means that 24,000 Miami workers are losing a total of $ 117 million annually .
