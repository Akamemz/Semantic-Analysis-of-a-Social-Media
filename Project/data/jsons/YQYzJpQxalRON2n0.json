    "content": "The Obama administration has a history of dealing harshly with those who mishandle classified information \u2014 unless the offender resides in the White House inner circle .\nThe FBI is conducting a security investigation of Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2019 s at-home private email server for holding classified material while she was secretary of state . A new poll shows the majority of Americans want a criminal probe , and some conservatives are calling for one .\nThis administration has investigated and prosecuted more security leakers and people who mishandled secrets than any other in history . It has sent six persons to prison .\nBut when it came to retired Marine Corps Gen. James E. Cartwright , the former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was said to be President Obama \u2019 s favorite general , the White House refused to cooperate with a special prosecutor . The prosecutor had named Mr. Cartwright as the target of his investigation of leaked secrets about a covert program to foil Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\nThe Washington Post reported the White House cited national security as the reason for not turning over records . NBC News reports Mr. Cartwright was a target , generally meaning the FBI had gathered enough evidence for an indictment . Mr. Cartwright \u2019 s attorney said his client did nothing wrong .\nThen there is the case of retired Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , one of the great figures in the war on terror who advises the Obama White House on national security . As CIA director and part of Mr. Obama \u2019 s closest national security advisers , he mishandled classified documents .\nHe received what some lawyers for other defendants complain was a slap on the wrist in a plea deal that allowed him to avoid prison .\nThen there were the leaks from the Obama administration about the May 2011 SEAL Team 6 raid that killed al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden . Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election campaign frequently pointed to the mission as a reason to re-elect him .\nThen-Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates was so appalled by the amount of information on tactics and techniques secrets pouring into the public from the White House that he strongly urged Obama aides to shut up .\nThe Defense Department inspector general conducted an investigation into White House support for the 2012 bin Laden hunt movie , \u201c Zero Dark Thirty. \u201d It found that the White House created talking points on the intelligence leading up to the mission to be shared with the moviemakers , according to a draft copy obtained by the Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) .\nThe IG also found that then-CIA Director Leon E. Panetta disclosed classified information at an awards ceremony at CIA headquarters attended by moviemakers who were not authorized to hear classified information . Mr. Panetta disclosed the ground commander \u2019 s name , which was protected . He also discussed material that was \u201c TOP SECRET//SI//REL , \u201d the draft report said .\nSI refers to \u201c special intelligence , \u201d or communications intercepts . REL means it can be shared with certain countries listed .\nThe IG \u2019 s final version , released publicly in June 2013 , scrubbed any mention of the Panetta slip .\nMr. Panetta told The Associated Press he did not know that the moviemakers had attended the ceremony .\nThe IG launched the investigation at the urging of a Republican lawmaker .\nFormer CIA analyst John Kiriakou spent two years in prison for leaking the identify of a CIA operative to the news media . Last year , he wrote in the Los Angeles Times that Mr. Panetta \u2019 s disclosures \u201c should result in a criminal espionage charge . \u201d\n\u201c The president and the attorney general have used the Espionage Act against more people than all other administrations combined , but not against real traitors and spies , \u201d he wrote from prison . \u201c The law has been applied selectively , often against whistle-blowers and others who expose illegal , corrupt government actions . \u201d\nThere are no public reports of any Obama administration officials being punished for providing raid details that so alarmed Mr. Gates .\nIn contrast , the Obama Justice Department has prosecuted at least nine persons for leaking or mishandling classified information : one Army soldier , two National Security Agency personnel , two FBI employees , one State Department contractor , two former CIA officers and Mr. Petraeus .\nUnlike Mr. Petraeus , the other eight were relatively low-ranking employees , and six were sentenced to prison terms .\nThe Obama administration also has placed government whistleblowers under investigation on claims they made unauthorized disclosures . The whistleblowers see these probes as a blatant attempt to silence them .\nSome conservatives have begun to call for a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton , the leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination .\nTom Fitton , president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch , which has filed a series of Freedom of Information lawsuits against the State Department and other agencies , has called for an independent prosecution outside the Justice Department .\nLast week , after news broke that Mrs. Clinton was turning over her private server to the FBI , Rep. Daniel E. Issa , California Republican , made a similar call .\n\u201c If any other American had shown the same disregard for securing classified information that Hillary Clinton showed , the United States government would move quickly and decisively to hold them responsible , \u201d Mr. Issa said . \u201c Months after we learned about Clinton \u2019 s secret email server , the FBI and DOJ have finally mustered the motivation necessary to take it into their custody . The only reasonable path forward is a criminal investigation . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John A.
