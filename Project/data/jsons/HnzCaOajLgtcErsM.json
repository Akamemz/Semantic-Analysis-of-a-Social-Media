    "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 John Podesta , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s top political adviser who served as chairman of her presidential campaign , expressed his support for a request by ten Electoral College voters to receive an intelligence briefing on claims of foreign intervention in the presidential election .\nPodesta \u2019 s statements seem to call into question the legitimacy of President-elect Donald Trump \u2019 s victory .\n\u201c The bipartisan electors \u2019 letter raises very grave issues involving our national security , \u201d Podesta said in a statement Monday , Politico reported . \u201c Electors have a solemn responsibility under the Constitution and we support their efforts to have their questions addressed . \u201d\n\u201c Each day that month , our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump , \u201d he said . \u201c Despite our protestations , this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign . We now know that the CIA has determined Russia \u2019 s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump . This should distress every American. \u201d Podesta was responding to an open letter from ten electors \u2013 including Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s daughter , Christine Pelosi , requesting the intelligence briefing . The electors wrote The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump , his campaign or associates , and Russian government interference in the election , the scope of those investigations , how far those investigations may have reached , and who was involved in those investigations . We further require a briefing on all investigative findings , as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States . Podesta \u2019 s statements are already strengthening attempts by Democratic lawmakers to impact the Electoral College vote on Dec.19 . Politico reported : Shortly after Podesta \u2019 s statement , the Democratic National Committee disseminated a POLITICO story that revealed the electors \u2019 call for a briefing . Two Democratic members of Congress have also suggested the Electoral College should take an active role in reassessing \u2014 or stopping \u2014 a Trump presidency .\nOver the weekend , a Democratic congressman asserted that members of the Electoral College should have the right to consider the alleged impact of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election when they cast their votes .\n\u201c To the extent that foreign interference in the United States presidential elections may have influenced the final result , I believe the electors have the right to consider that , \u201d Rep. David Cicilline ( D-R.I. ) told POLITICO in a statement on Saturday .\nCicilline appears to be the first member of Congress and the highest-ranking elected official in the country to endorse the notion that electors aren \u2019 t simply rubber stamps for their states \u2019 popular vote . Earlier Saturday , he retweeted a Rhode Island-based national security expert who argued that the intelligence community \u201c must brief electoral college about Russia before vote . \u201d\nCicilline was referring to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times claiming Moscow interfered in the presidential election to help Donald Trump win \u2014 a contention the President-elect called \u201c ridiculous \u201d in an interview on Sunday .\nCicilline \u2019 s comments come after a Democratic presidential elector from California filed a lawsuit aiming to overturn a California statute that requires him and the states \u2019 other electors to support the winner of the popular vote in the state with the aim of voting for someone else . The lawsuit , the second of its kind nationwide , is clearly part of an effort to set a legal precedent to free any rogue Republican electors in other states to cast their ballots for someone other than Trump .\nThe lawsuits join a larger effort to try to turn electors against voting for Trump . Last week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported Harvard law professor and progressive activist Larry Lessig announced that he is teaming up with a California-based law firm to offer \u201c free and confidential \u201d legal services to any members of the Electoral College who will vote against President-elect Donald Trump in violation of state law .\nLessig , a one-time presidential candidate , has served on the boards of numerous groups financed by billionaire George Soros .\nLessig \u2019 s Electoral College scheme , which is being called the Electors Trust , is a last-ditch effort to stop Trump from becoming president .\nIt comes after a petition drive by the Soros-funded MoveOn.org activist organization sought to abolish the Electoral College altogether .\nLessig \u2019 s project also follows the largely failed recount efforts of Green Party candidate Jill Stein , who was aided by Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign . \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that the lawyer representing Clinton \u2019 s recount efforts , Marc Elias , recently led legal battles against state voting laws with an infusion of funding from Soros .\nLessig \u2019 s effort to help electors vote against Trump was first reported on Monday by Politico :\nLessig says his new effort , which he calls \u201c The Electors Trust , \u201d will provide free counsel to electors , provided by the midsize firm , Durie Tangri , whose partner Mark Lemley is a longtime associate of Lessig \u2019 s . More significantly , Lessig said , the Trust will offer a platform \u2013 with guaranteed anonymity \u2013 for electors to strategize about stopping Trump from taking the White House . It \u2019 s a platform , he said , that could help electors coordinate to determine whether they \u2019 ve gathered enough support to stop Trump from winning the presidency . \u201c It makes no sense to be elector number five who comes out against Trump . But it might make sense to be elector 38 , \u201d Lessig said in a phone interview .\nWith their permission , the electors can allow others to know that they are considering a vote of conscience . But that information will not include either their identity or their state . Our primary objective is to provide a safe and confidential legal context in which electors can seek advice and support , and depending on the facts , an opportunity to litigate to defend their freedom .\nReached for comment , Lessig last week refused to provide \u2588\u2588\u2588 with the specific numbers of electors who are allegedly considering switching their votes from Trump .\n\u201c \u201d I \u2019 m not in the information flow for that . We \u2019 re being very careful to assure anonymity , \u201d Lessig said .\nPolitico reported advocates of the bid to turn the votes of electors against Trump have briefed allies close to Hillary Clinton .\nClinton \u2019 s team and the Democratic National Committee have steadfastly refused to endorse the efforts spearheaded by a group of electors in Colorado and Washington state . But , as with the ongoing recounts initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein , the Clinton team has not categorically rejected them , leaving the collection of mainly Democratic electors to push forward with no explicit public support from the failed Democratic nominee or any other prominent party leaders .\nLessig launched his project after one Republican elector , Chris Suprun of Texas , published a news-making op-ed in the New York Times announcing his intentions not to vote for Trump when the Electoral College meets on Dec. 19 to formally elect the president .\nLessig \u2019 s movement seems to be gaining some momentum , even if it is a long shot . On Tuesday , the New York Times published an opinion piece by Elizabeth Williamson citing Republican insiders saying there are other quiet \u201c faithless electors \u201d like Suprun plotting to vote against Trump . Still , Williamson , a Times editorial writer who specializes in national politics , admitted the chances of the effort succeeding amount to a \u201c moon shot . \u201d\nWashington Post columnist Kathleen Parker also advocated for the scheme in a piece titled , \u201c The electoral college should be unfaithful . \u201d\nParker claimed renegade electors would write a new history of \u201c heroism \u201d :\nElectors are scheduled to meet Dec. 19 in their respective states to cast their final ballots .
