That wouldn\u2019t be big enough to accommodate her pants suits.\n\nMr. Comey continues to shred what\u2019s left of his reputation as a fearless tough guy eager to do the right thing. His diagnosis of Hillary\u2019s character and competence stopped just short of doing anything about her breaking of the law. President Obama says Hillary would be the most qualified president since Thomas Jefferson, greater than Madison, Monroe, Lincoln, the two Roosevelts and presumably even his own magnificent self.

Mr. Comey\u2019s gift to Hillary of a \u201csoiled bill of health,\u201d as one clever headline writer put it, recalls the vote at a country church in the Arkansas of my youth, where the congregation had a falling out with the pastor.
