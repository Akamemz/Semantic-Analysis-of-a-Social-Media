When the liberal Associated Press feels the need to address readers \u2019 assumptions about Islam and terrorism , we have a reached a tipping point .\nMake that a worldwide tipping point . With the pope and Cardinal Timothy Dolan joining Jewish leaders and growing numbers of Muslim officials in Arab lands speaking honestly about the horrors perpetrated under Islam \u2019 s name , that leaves President Obama as the odd man out .\nNot every Muslim is a terrorist . But almost all terrorists are Muslims . Those two statements are both accurate , as even Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi tacitly conceded when he scolded Islamic clerics for failing to halt the spread of jihadists .

They soon gave up , conceding what French authorities said all along \u2014 the slaughter was an anti-Semitic attack by a follower of the Islamic State .\nObama \u2019 s hesitation to admit the obvious fact about the victims echoes the refusal to properly call Islamic terrorists what they are .\nAt the same time , he has no problem standing up for Islam when he thinks its adherents are wronged . Although police have not concluded that the murder of three Muslims in North Carolina had anything to do with religion \u2014 the killer confessed and denied religion was an issue \u2014 the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation and Obama issued a statement suggesting the murders were hate crimes .\n\u201c No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are , what they look like , or how they worship , \u201d he said .\nRemember , too , that he recently singled out the Crusades to warn Christians about getting on their \u201c high horse \u201d over Muslim killers .\nIf the issue were only semantics , it would be minor in the grand scheme .
