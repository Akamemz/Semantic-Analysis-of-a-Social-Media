''\nJUST WATCHED Committee member : We 've learned nothing in Benghazi hearing Replay More Videos ...

''\n`` I would imagine I 've thought more about what happened than all of you put together . I 've lost more sleep than all of you put together , '' Clinton said .\nThe following morning , one source told CNN that Clinton HQ was `` ecstatic . ''\n`` That was a president sitting there , '' the source , a Clinton campaign aide , said .\nRep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , pushed Clinton hard over her use of a private email server -- mocking her as `` the most transparent person ever . ''\nHe demanded to know the search terms her attorneys used to sort through which emails were work-related and therefore should be turned over to the State Department and which were personal .\n`` You might have made more mistakes -- we do n't know , '' Jordan said .\nClinton appeared a bit thrown , unable to answer questions about how , specifically , her lawyers combed through her emails .\n`` I have been releasing my emails to the public , '' she said , a reference to the State Department 's court-ordered release of her work emails .\nThe hearing started at 10 a.m. , and Jordan 's line of questioning did n't begin until 7:45 p.m . If Republicans were hoping Clinton would be worn down , it did n't happen . But they did manage to push the portion about Clinton 's private server into prime-time television . It was a risk , as some news outlets -- like Fox News -- had already cut away from the hearing .\nThe email questions did push Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings over the edge , though , as he lambasted Republicans for trying to `` badger you into a gotcha moment . ''\n`` We 're better than that . We are so much better .

MUST WATCH Did Clinton talk to Stevens before his death ? 02:50\nDid Clinton speak with Stevens in the months before he died ?\nOne of the most compelling -- and informative -- moments of the day unfolded shortly after 7 p.m. during an exchange with Rep. Susan Brooks , R-Ind. , who repeatedly asked whether Clinton had spoken with Stevens after he was sworn in as the U.S. ambassador to Libya in May 2012 and before his death on Sept. 11 , 2012 .\n`` We do n't know the answer . Did you ever personally speak to him after you swore him in in May ? '' Brooks asked Clinton , her voice raising with emotion . `` Yes or no please . ''\n`` Yes , I believe I did , '' Clinton replied . `` I do n't recall . ''\nIt was a moment that will almost certainly be referred back to again and again , particularly by critics who believe Clinton did not do enough to secure the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi . It was reminiscent of those five words that still reverberate from her 2013 testimony : `` What difference does it make ? ''\nHer voice was calm . She stood her ground . But Clinton bluntly explained that there are many diplomatic personnel working in dangerous conditions -- not just Libya .\n`` We have diplomatic facilities in war zones , '' Clinton said . `` We have ambassadors that we send to places that have been bombed and attacked all the time . ''\n`` Had you talked to him in July , he would have told you that he had asked to keep the security in Libya that he had , '' Brooks said . `` He was told no by your State Department .

Gowdy spent weeks trying to show that the work is only focused on getting the truth -- not Clinton .\nBut Gowdy 's lines of questioning -- hitting Clinton about her friends and her emails -- will do little to erase doubts about his committee , especially as Democrats continue their threat to pull out altogether .\nIt 's unclear whether it sullies his future , though : Gowdy ultimately wants to leave Congress when the committee work concludes and become a federal judge , which would require a Republican in the White House .\nGowdy was unable to say what was different between Thursday 's event and the last time she testified .\n`` I do n't know that she testified that much differently today than the previous times she 's testified , '' Gowdy told CNN .\nThe biggest player in Thursday 's hearing might not have been in the room at all .\nIt was Sidney Blumenthal -- a long-time friend of the former secretary of state who often emailed her what Clinton has described as `` unsolicited '' takes on Libya and other situations , based on conversations with his own contacts .\nThe committee 's chairman , Gowdy , made Blumenthal the focus of the first 10-minute period in which he questioned Clinton . He highlighted negative remarks Blumenthal had made about other members of President Barack Obama 's administration .\n`` You know , Mr. Chairman , if you do n't have any friends who say unkind things privately , I congratulate you , but from my perspective , I do n't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of four deaths of Americans , '' Clinton said .\nThe committee has already interviewed Blumenthal . Democrats got frustrated enough with the GOP 's comments about him that they moved to make public the transcript of that interview -- but Republicans voted down that motion .\nSaid Rep.

The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially thought the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video, made in the United States, that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But the storming of the mission was later determined to have been a terrorist attack.
