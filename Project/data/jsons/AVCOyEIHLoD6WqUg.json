But they said that Mr. Panetta had little choice in referring the matter to the inspector general . General Dempsey informed General Allen of the investigation on Monday from Perth , where he had traveled for a security meeting that Mr. Panetta is also attending .\nGeneral Allen , a Marine , succeeded Mr. Petraeus as the top allied commander in Afghanistan in July 2011 .

The e-mail warned General Allen to be wary of Ms. Kelley and was vaguely threatening . Though he did not know who had written the e-mail , he was concerned and passed it on to Ms. Kelley . She then discussed it with an agent she knew at the F.B.I. \u2019 s field office in Tampa , whose cybercrime unit opened an investigation that eventually linked Ms. Broadwell to General Petraeus .\nA senior law enforcement official in Washington said Tuesday that F.B.I . investigators , looking into Ms. Kelley \u2019 s complaint about anonymous e-mails she had received , examined all of her e-mails as a routine step . Officials familiar with the investigation said it covers 20,000 to 30,000 page of documents , but Pentagon officials cautioned against making too much of that number , since some might be from e-mail chains , or brief messages printed out on a whole page .\nOn Monday night , F.B.I . agents searched Ms. Broadwell \u2019 s home in Charlotte , N.C. , and local television news crews filmed them carrying away boxes of material in what officials said was part of that continuing investigation .\nThe defense official said that the e-mails between Ms. Kelley and General Allen spanned the years 2010 to 2012 .\nAmerican officials familiar with the social dynamics at the upper echelons of the Central Command described Ms. Kelley as wealthy socialite who knew \u201c almost every \u201d high-ranking officer serving in Tampa . Her ties were close enough that Mr. Petraeus and General Allen both intervened last September in a messy custody dispute on behalf of Ms. Kelley \u2019 s twin sister , Natalie Khawam .\nA senior official said Ms. Kelley was close to both General Allen and his wife . She would often send e-mails , hundreds over the course of any given year , to the couple about parties or people she had met or trips she was considering .
