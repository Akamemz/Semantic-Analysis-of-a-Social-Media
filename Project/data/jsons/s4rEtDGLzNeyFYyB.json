    "content": "In the weeks after a gunman walked into a high school in Parkland , Florida , and killed 17 students and faculty members , survivors are n't giving up their fight for stronger gun control efforts .\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School teenagers have moved front and center in the gun control debate , organizing a coming national school walkout , meeting with President Donald Trump , lobbying state lawmakers and participating in protests .\nSince the Feb. 14 shooting , several ideas have been floated by the White House , Republicans , Democrats and state officials to combat gun violence . Trump also hosted a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House to discuss reform .\nTrump and Republicans suggested the possibility of arming teachers after the school shooting \u2013 and Florida lawmakers moved closer to do that this week .\nA school safety bill that , among other things , would allow up to 10 school personnel to be armed , narrowly passed the Florida state House in March , and Gov . Rick Scott , a Republican , signed it into law .\nOn Twitter , Trump promoted the idea of having \u201c highly trained , gun adept \u201d teachers and coaches in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrived or serve as a \u201c deterrent to the cowards that do this . \u201d\n\u201c If a potential \u2018 sicko shooter \u2019 knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers ( and others ) who will be instantly shooting , the sicko will NEVER attack that school . Cowards won \u2019 t go there ... problem solved . Must be offensive , defense alone won \u2019 t work ! \u201d Trump tweeted .\nTwo school districts near Dayton , Ohio , already train a group of select teachers and faculty members to confront an active shooter . These staff members , whose identities are not revealed , have access to safes throughout the schools which have guns hidden inside .\nOhio offers funding for schools to train staff to respond in emergency situations . There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff members who are trained to fire back , or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds .\nTrump has seemed open to strengthening the federal background check process for gun purchases , saying it should be a bipartisan effort to do so .\nGun control advocates point to what they see as \u201c loopholes \u201d in the current system that could allow for people to purchase guns even when they legally should not be able to do so .\nSpecifically , Jonas Oransky , deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety , a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control , noted the ability for consumers to purchase guns from a private seller without completing a background check .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious , but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller , \u201d Oransky told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHe also pointed to the so-called \u201c Charleston loophole , \u201d which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed \u2013 when National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) marks a document \u201c delayed \u201d but does not approve or deny it within three business days . He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers , citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that all sellers are dangerous or devious , but buyers who know that they can skip the background check can look for an unlicensed seller. \u201d \u2014 Jonas Oransky , Everytown for Gun Safety\nHowever , Second Amendment advocates argue the background check system already does too much .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right , \u201d Erich Pratt , executive director of Gun Owners of America , a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn the wake of the Parkland shooting , Trump said he signed an order instructing the Justice Department to ban bump stocks , an attachment that allows a semi-automatic rifle to resemble a fully automatic weapon .\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said top officials in the Justice Department believe they can ban bump stocks through the regulatory process . However , gun manufacturers and owners are likely to sue if they are banned without any legislation from Congress .\nBump stocks were approved in 2010 by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives after concluding the devices did not turn guns into machine guns , which are prohibited under the National Firearms Act .\nThe devices weren \u2019 t used in the Parkland shooting , but the massacre did reignite the debate over whether they should be banned .\nSen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , said he 's open to changing his stance on one gun control measure after meeting with survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting : high-capacity magazines .\n`` I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it , I am reconsidering that position , '' Rubio said during a recent town hall . `` While it may not prevent an attack , it may save lives in an attack ... So we 'll have to get into that debate , but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise [ on ] in this country , and that I 'm willing to reconsider . ''\nThe suspected gunman had to stop to reload his firearm during the massacre , which Rubio added was \u201c evidence in this case that it saved the lives of some people . \u201d\nSeveral measures introduced in states across the country \u2013 including in Colorado , Illinois and Rhode Island \u2013 would ban high-capacity magazines .\nAfter hosting survivors of gun violence and their parents at the White House , Trump publicly backed raising the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic weapons to 21 .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing more important than protecting our children , \u201d Trump said .\nWhen Republican Sen. Pat Toomey , R-Pa. , acknowledged that a bill he \u2019 s sponsored with Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , to broaden background checks does not include raising the age limit , Trump accused him of being \u201c afraid of the NRA . \u201d\nNational Rifle Association ( NRA ) spokeswoman Dana Loesch has already said the powerful gun lobby does not support raising the age limit to purchase certain firearms . After Trump \u2019 s White House meeting , she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 it was \u201c good TV , \u201d but some of the proposals were \u201c really bad policy . \u201d\n\u201c Certainly , nobody under 21 should have an AR-15. \u201d \u2014 Sen.

Just 39 percent of respondents said adults who pass a background check should be allowed to purchase the firearm .\nDick \u2019 s Sporting Goods announced in February that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm .\n\u201c We support and respect the Second Amendment , and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible , law-abiding citizens , \u201d Edward W.
