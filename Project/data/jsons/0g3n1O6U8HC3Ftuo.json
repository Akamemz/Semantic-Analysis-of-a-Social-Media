Sunday \u2019 s debate was no exception . The mutual contempt on display was unquestionable . In this , the candidates felt like all-too-vivid proxies for the electorate at large .\nIt seems as if every day we are reminded of the ways some Americans hold strongly opposing views on a variety of issues . A host of academic studies has reinforced this belief , revealing one finding after another on just how differently liberals and conservatives think . A vicious circle is at work today in which reporting on political polarization only creates an even more entrenched sense of the problem . How , many of us are starting to ask , are we ever going to get out of this ?\nThis past year we began a project to try to reverse this tendency . Using the techniques of big data , we wanted to see if there were spaces where Republicans and Democrats occupied common ground . Rather than look for more divisiveness \u2013 clearly an easy find \u2013 we set ourselves the more challenging task of trying to discover what we have in common as a culture .\nThe linguist Roman Jakobson once contrasted political conventions with literary ones : the problem with political conventions , he said , is that they encourage people to \u201c mindlessly agree \u201d with slogans , which in turn , create unnecessary antagonism between different groups of people .\nLiterary conventions , on the other hand , where individuals get together to read and talk about books , were different . Unlike slogans and speeches , literature encourages people to discuss their differences in more thoughtful and flexible ways . We might disagree on a number of issues , but literature helps create a space where we can compromise .\nAs professors of literature , we are constantly reminded of the ways that literature can provide material where readers engage in meaningful debate about tough ideas . We see it time and again in our classrooms , when two students who hold divergent political beliefs find a way to debate a difficult topic such as racism through a discussion of Toni Morrison \u2019 s Beloved or the Holocaust through a reading of WG Sebald \u2019 s The Emigrants . Over time , we \u2019 ve maintained a belief that Jakobson \u2019 s idea of \u201c literary conventions \u201d still exists , at least in the classroom .\nBut what about in the wider world ? Conventional wisdom , supported by a spate of recent studies , tells us that literature and books are precisely the things that divide conservatives and liberals : conservatives are \u201c illiterate \u201d while liberals are \u201c well read \u201d . Could we find evidence to the contrary ?\nTo answer this question , we decided to study readers \u2019 behavior through the website Goodreads.com . Goodreads is a website owned by Amazon where users can list books they have read or would like to read , post reviews , and carry out discussions . Currently , the website has 55 million users who have posted reviews , annotations , or discussions of over 10m books . It represents a vibrant literary convention .\nWe began by identifying readers \u2019 political affiliation by seeing if they had positively rated one or more books from a hand-curated list of highly partisan writing \u2013 titles like James Carville \u2019 s It \u2019 s the Middle Class , Stupid ! or Paul Krugman \u2019 s End This Depression Now ! on the left and Glenn Beck \u2019 s Cowards , Ann Coulter \u2019 s Demonic , or Pat Buchanan \u2019 s Suicide of a Superpower on the right , to name a few of the 200 titles we used . These are books that are unabashedly written to divide people \u2019 s sentiments on the left and right . If you liked a book from the left group ( meaning you rated it three stars or higher ) then you were labeled a \u201c liberal reader \u201d , and if you liked a book from the right group , you were labeled a \u201c conservative reader \u201d . This gave us a total of 27,852 readers .\nNext , we catalogued all of the books that appeared on our \u201c conservative reader \u201d bookshelves and labeled them as \u201c conservative \u201d , and vice versa . We only focused on books labeled \u201c fiction \u201d or \u201c literature \u201d because we wanted to test our belief in Jakobson \u2019 s idea of the literary convention . This gave us just under 3,000 books that appeared on a minimum of 100 readers \u2019 bookshelves ( out of several hundred thousand books overall ) . Finally , we conducted a statistical test to find out which books were more likely to be on one group of readers \u2019 shelves than the other .\nThe initial results tended to confirm our worst stereotypes . ( Readers can explore the full lists here ) . Conservatives like to read low-brow genre fiction such as novels by John Grisham and Tom Clancy , as well as recent book-to-movie titles , such as The Maze Runner , while liberals enjoy reading more demanding , high-brow novels that win prizes , such as Jennifer Egan \u2019 s A Visit from the Goon Squad , Morrison \u2019 s Beloved , as well as European classics like The Outsider by Albert Camus , which are often taught at colleges . These lists support polarizing stereotypes that pit sophisticated readers of \u201c difficult \u201d prose ( liberals ) against simple-minded readers of formulaic fiction ( conservatives ) .\nYet , when we dug deeper we also found a sizable set of books that appeared on both types of readers \u2019 shelves in roughly equal amounts . As we suspected , it wasn \u2019 t all polarization and difference . We identify these books as \u201c bridge books \u201d because they bridge the gap between right and left . These are books that liberals and conservatives both like to read .\nIn a sense , these books point to some kind of shared culture . We were surprised to find more than 400 of them , many of which were some of the most popular in our data set : To Kill a Mockingbird , 1984 , Lord of the Flies , but also The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo , Game of Thrones ( # 1 ) , The Lovely Bones and Bridget Jones \u2019 s Diary . The space of cultural compromise was larger than we expected , but also more diverse . It contained classics like Romeo and Juliet and Jane Eyre , but also highly popular contemporary books like World War Z ( the top 100 are listed here ) .\nJust skimming these lists , though , one might conclude that they are basically random or arbitrary . After all , both Democrats and Republicans like Taylor Swift . That doesn \u2019 t mean that Swift \u2019 s songs possess some profound , underlying capacity for political reconciliation . For these books to have any meaning , they must together convey some coherent message or set of ideas . Only then can we know that they provide a key to the forms of cultural expression that hold us together rather than drive us apart .\nWe turned to new techniques in the field of text analytics to better understand what might distinguish the content of non-partisan books from their more partisan kin \u2013 in other words , to figure out what makes them special . Our tests revealed a few interesting bits of insight , such as non-partisan books tend to have more first person pronouns , and they talk considerably less about themes like money or work . But overall , we couldn \u2019 t find a signal that was particularly strong or revealing .\nOnly when we turned to analyzing how readers talked about these books did we discover some intriguing results . That is , we wanted to know not only whether there were differences in the content of non-partisan books , but also whether they elicit different reactions on the part of readers through the content of their reviews . What we found was surprising : when both conservative and liberal readers talk about \u201c bridge books \u201d instead of their usual partisan books , they change their way of talking and thinking in significant ways . They use less negative or hateful language . They use more words related to cognitive insight , such as \u201c admit \u201d and \u201c explain \u201d . In short , what is special about these books is that they make readers who otherwise have strong political dispositions become less tribal . When people read these books , they embrace a more tolerant worldview .\nBut our most startling result was this : it was conservative \u2013 not liberal \u2013 readers who are most active in producing this space of cultural compromise . When discussing our bridge books , conservatives used more positive emotions than liberals , something that runs counter to the angry white man thesis of conservative voters . Conservative readers , at least on Goodreads , are more generous when talking about the same books as their liberal counterparts . They tend to be less heated or emotional , and based on an analysis of grammar , they tend to formulate more complex thoughts . If our bridge books are making right- and leftwing readers less extreme in their language and worldviews , it is conservatives who are doing the work . This finding runs strongly opposite to today \u2019 s conventional wisdom . A series of studies , reported widely in the media , claim that polarization is \u201c asymmetric \u201d , and Republicans are to blame . If there is an imagined villain in today \u2019 s crisis of political polarization , it would be the right .\nThese are counterintuitive results that should give us pause . Literature and books , long seen to be the thing that drives Republicans and Democrats apart , can be a site of political reconciliation . And there exists a particular group of books that facilitate this process . We \u2019 re not sure what makes this group of books special , but we do know that readers see something special in them , and these books are changing how they talk about ideas and how they talk to other people . Most importantly , these results should change how we distribute the blame for polarization . Liberals , who have long derided the reading habits and ideological extremism of the right , might have something to learn .",
