Susan Collins (R-Maine) to set up a meeting, the first response was a standard D.C. offer. They could get a meeting with her staff, and Collins would stop by, they were told.\n\nThe families\u2019 answer: not good enough. According to their lobbyists, the families have a rule against staff-only meetings: They won\u2019t do them. They insist on sitting down with the senators themselves. The families wound up getting more than 15 minutes with Collins.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat rule is just one of the ways that the Newtown families, political novices just a few months ago, are proving to be savvy, effective advocates as they promote the gun legislation that has finally begun to move through the Senate.
