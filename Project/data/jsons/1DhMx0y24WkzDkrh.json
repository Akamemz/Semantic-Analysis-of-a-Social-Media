Schools in the lower part of the county , Scarsdale , have closed for ten days . Schools across the border into the Bronx , such as Fordham University , have also closed . A school district next to ours closed for one day because of a trace contact between a student and a confirmed case .

That seems like a protocol for discovering that you failed to contain the coronavirus , not for discovering when you should start acting to contain it . South Korea and Hong Kong closed schools before they became major vectors of transmission . Their numbers are starting to level off , but Seoul began discouraging people from leaving their homes unnecessarily five weeks ago .\nIn my email to the superintendent , I used a phrase a similarly concerned friend gave me as a shorthand for explaining to myself and to others why I \u2019 m taking action : \u201c Too early is , by definition , \u2018 not too late. \u2019 \u201d I \u2019 m not a germaphobe or health nut .

But I have an abiding belief that the hardest prejudice to overcome is the notion that things will go on roughly as they always have .\nCould President Trump be right that the Wuhan virus is less concerning that the flu , because it is less prevalent ? Maybe . But I doubt it . When there is not time for long-term longitudinal studies , broad prejudice is a good enough substitute . One might dismiss the extraordinary actions of China , South Korea , and Japan as actions taken by germaphobic , authoritarian East Asian cultures .

One could dismiss the quarantine of Lombardy as an overreaction by dramatic Italians , though that doesn \u2019 t quite work : Lombardy is more like an Italian-speaking half-Teutonic Switzerland .
