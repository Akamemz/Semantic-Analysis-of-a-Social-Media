You rub it and it goes away even faster . \u201d\nBryan added , \u201c We \u2019 re also looking at other disinfectants , specifically looking at the COVID-19 virus in saliva . \u201d\nSo , I \u2019 m going to ask Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of if you \u2019 re totally into that world , which I find to be very interesting .

And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body , which you can do either through the skin or in some other way . And I think you said you \u2019 re going to test that too . Sounds interesting . And then I see the disinfectant , where it knocks it out in a minute , one minute . And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning ?
