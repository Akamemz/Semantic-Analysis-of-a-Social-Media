Rosa DeLauro , Connecticut Democrat and a leading opponent of giving the president special authority to negotiate the trade pact . \u201c I believe they underestimated the depth of feeling . \u201d\nWhite House aides were in discussions with lawmakers to find \u201c a path forward \u201d to rescue the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership , a sprawling agreement with 11 other Pacific-rim nations . The administration also was scrambling to reassure foreign governments from Japan to Canada that the failed test vote in the Senate Tuesday was not a fatal blow to the overall trade agreement .\nBut White House press secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged that the administration hasn \u2019 t yet found a solution to persuading U.S. lawmakers to grant trade-promotion authority to Mr. Obama .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have one to announce now , \u201d he said . \u201c This is something that \u2019 s under a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill . \u201d\nEven as administration officials were trying to work through the policy differences with their own party , however , the White House also was grappling with renewed criticism about Mr. Obama bungling his personal outreach effort with an approach perceived by some as condescending and even sexist . Liberals from Sen. Sherrod Brown , Ohio Democrat , to NOW President Terry O \u2019 Neill said it was sexist for the president to refer to Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat and a vocal opponent of the deal , as \u201c Elizabeth . \u201d\n\u201c I think it is sexist , \u201d Ms. O \u2019 Neill told The Hill newspaper . \u201c I think the president was trying to build up his own trustworthiness on this issue by convincing us that Senator Warren \u2019 s concerns are not to be taken seriously . But he did it in a sexist way . \u201d\nMr. Brown later relented from his criticism , saying he would apologize to Mr. Obama .\nSenate Democrats filibustered Tuesday to stop the first major free-trade deal vote in years , with the administration \u2019 s effort falling seven votes short of the 60 needed to proceed with debate . Only one Democrat , Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware , voted with the president on legislation to give Mr. Obama trade-promotion authority .\nHouse Democrats said the White House miscalculated badly by rejecting lawmakers \u2019 calls to include a provision in the TPP to address currency manipulation by other countries . Rep. David Scott , Georgia Democrat , called it \u201c the Achilles heel \u201d of the proposed agreement and said the administration \u2019 s refusal to address it was \u201c asinine . \u201d\nRep. Joe Courtney , Connecticut Democrat , said the administration has been downplaying lawmakers \u2019 concerns for years about including an enforceable provision against currency manipulation in the TPP .\n\u201c A huge bipartisan collection of members have been sending up smoke signals for years , going back to 2013 , \u201d Mr. Courtney said . \u201c To not have an agreement that has enforceable provisions on that issue , it \u2019 s almost political malpractice for members of Congress to just sort of look the other way . All of us would have preferred that the administration heeded the early input that all of us were giving on this issue and brought this to the table . \u201d\nThe president has said that addressing currency manipulation could have an adverse impact on U.S. monetary policy , an argument that Mr. Courtney called \u201c misleading rebuttal . \u201d\nMrs. DeLauro said the administration has \u201c rebuffed \u201d lawmakers \u2019 concerns about currency manipulation , food safety and enforceable labor standards for more than two years , and the problem is now coming back to haunt the president .\n\u201c The White House and the administration have only begun to engage in the last few months , really , \u201d she told reporters . \u201c We \u2019 ve been rebuffed . Now there is this frenetic sense of \u2018 let \u2019 s try to address those people who are still undecided . \u2019 \u201d\nSpeaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican who supports the deal , has said the White House needs to provide about 50 votes from the 188 Democratic House lawmakers to help pass the measure . More than 150 House Democrats last year came out in opposition to the deal , and Mrs. DeLauro recited the names of a handful of other Democratic lawmakers who have recently announced their opposition , including Reps. Adam Schiff of California and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois .\nThe so-called \u201c fast-track \u201d authority allows a president to negotiate trade deals with other countries , then submit them for up-or-down votes in Congress without amendments . Analysts say that if Congress were allowed to amend deals , it would make it impossible to negotiate with foreign governments .\nBut the Senate test vote brought to light the breathtaking spectacle of Democratic lawmakers complaining that the president of their own party was trying to grab too much power .\n\u201c We have seen too much power ceded from Congress to the executive branch at the expense of the United States , particularly in foreign matters , \u201d said Rep. David Scott , Georgia Democrat . \u201c You can look at the Iran [ nuclear ] deal , look at a lot of things . Congress has to retain our place . This should be a shared trade deal , not just by the president himself . \u201d\nThe simmering feud between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Warren , an icon of the progressive wing , showed no signs of abating . The White House also faced more second-guessing about Mr. Obama \u2019 s decision to promote the trade deal last week at the headquarters of Nike , a company that has used \u201c sweatshop \u201d labor overseas \u2014 a particular sore point with progressive groups .\nEven as the White House was trying to patch up relations with Democratic lawmakers , Mr .
