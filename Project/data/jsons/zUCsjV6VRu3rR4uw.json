    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s first one hundred days in office have been clouded by an unprecedented obfuscation campaign by Democrats , some Republicans , the establishment news media and a coalition of outside agitators attempting to disrupt the billionaire \u2019 s presidential agenda , smear top administration officials , sow seeds of chaos , and delegitimize his already historic presidency .\nA review of events is instructive . Even before Trump took office , the attempts to delegitimize the billionaire kicked into high gear when Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign joined the improbable recount efforts led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein .\nWhen those efforts failed miserably , the Clinton campaign turned to an outlandish attempt to usurp Trump \u2019 s Electoral College victory . John Podesta , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s top political adviser who served as chairman of her presidential campaign , expressed his support in December for a petition calling for Electoral College voters to receive an intelligence briefing on claims of Russian intervention in the presidential election .\nAround the same time , a Democratic presidential elector from California filed a lawsuit aiming to overturn a California statute that requires him and the states \u2019 other electors to support the winner of the popular vote in the state . The lawsuit was clearly part of an effort to set a legal precedent to free any rogue Republican electors in other states to cast their ballots for someone other than Trump .\nIn addition , Harvard law professor and progressive activist Larry Lessig announced that he was teaming up with a California-based law firm to offer \u201c free and confidential \u201d legal services to any members of the Electoral College who would vote against Trump in violation of state law .\nTrump \u2019 s inauguration was marred by threats of mass protest by a movement dubbed DisruptJ20 , which \u2588\u2588\u2588 exposed as being made up of professional left-wing activists with ties to groups financed by George Soros .\nAnd as Michael Goodwin correctly noted in the New York Post on Wednesday , Trump \u2019 s inauguration was followed 24-hours later by a so-called Women \u2019 s March seeking to taint the newly installed president . That protest group was a coalition that reportedly consisted of more than 50 \u201c partners \u201d tied to Soros . This journalist first reported on the march leaders \u2019 own close associations with Soros .\nTrump was also welcomed to office by Soros-financed advocacy groups openly working for the new president \u2019 s impeachment .\nSome of the basis for the many attempts to delegitimize Trump center on unsubstantiated Russian intervention claims that began after Trump was elected and have since been repeatedly utilized to delegitimize the president .\nOnly last week , it was revealed that the controversial , partially discredited 35-page dossier on Trump compiled by a former British intelligence officer served as the FBI \u2019 s justification for seeking court approval to clandestinely monitor Carter Page , who has been identified as a foreign policy adviser to Trump .\nThis is not the FBI \u2019 s only use of the dossier . Last month , the BBC reported the document served as a \u201c roadmap \u201d for the FBI \u2019 s investigation into claims of coordination between Moscow and members of Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign .\nThe dossier , which contains wild and unproven claims about Trump and sordid sexual acts , including the widely-mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed , was compiled by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele , who was reportedly paid by Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans to investigate Trump . The credibility of the document has been called into question by current and former U.S officials .\nEven before he took office , Trump \u2019 s future presidency was mired in multiple attempts to smear his incoming administration with numerous trumped up charges , from falsified claims of anti-Semitism to comparisons to murderous leader Adolf Hitler to questions surrounding his emotional health .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 reported on the talking point theme in which numerous Democratic Party operatives and establishment pundits began to increasingly use the word \u201c treason \u201d in a seeming attempt to smear Trump over the unproven Russia collusion claims . Many of the arguments mirrored each other in specific ways .\nIn February , another establishment echo-chamber trend emerged in which news media outlets featured articles quoting health care professionals who questioned the billionaire \u2019 s mental stability .\nFollowing those reports , some Democratic politicians \u2013 and at least one Republican \u2013 called for Trump to be subjected to a psychiatric examination to determine whether he was fit for office . Some commentators have even suggested invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution , which allows for the commander-in-chief \u2019 s removal from office if the \u201c president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office . \u201d\nThe health care professionals quoted in recent months attempting to diagnose Trump seem to be violating the so-called Goldwater Rule , established by the American Psychiatric Association after similar unsupported attacks against Senator Barry Goldwater during his 1964 presidential campaign , which was widely considered a threat to the political establishment . The APA \u2019 s Goldwater Rule forbids psychiatrists from commenting on someone \u2019 s mental status unless they first carry out an examination and the doctor is authorized by the patient to speak to the public .\nTrump has been the target of numerous major protests depicted as grassroots by some news media outlets .\nLast Saturday , for example , an anti-Trump Tax Day March was held in Washington and at least 60 other locations .

The script provided word-for-word language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of \u201c xenophobia , racism and Islamophobia. \u201d It asked activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to \u201c forcefully condemn \u201d and support legislation opposing Trump \u2019 s immigration and border security agendas .\nMeanwhile , Soros groups are not limiting themselves to protests .
