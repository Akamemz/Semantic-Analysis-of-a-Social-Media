Just one week into his presidency he ordered the Pentagon to develop a plan to \u201c demolish and destroy \u201d the group . Then U.S. and allied forces did just that .\nOur militaries obliterated a jihadist force that sprung out of the vacuum of the Syrian civil war and once grew so large as to approach the outskirts of Baghdad in neighboring Iraq .\nPresident Trump \u2019 s choice of retired Marine Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense was pivotal . Mattis freed U.S. forces who had been fighting with one arm tied behind their backs , and contributed to major battlefield gains without a massive invasion .\nOf course , ISIS stragglers still exist . Remember that Japanese holdouts were still coming out of the jungle to surrender long after World War II ended ? But ISIS is kaput as an organized military and governing force in Syria and Iraq .\nNow it is time to bring our military home . President Trump correctly tweeted : \u201c We have defeated ISIS in Syria , my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency . \u201d\nOf course , hawks will be upset . Sen.
