Neither is likely to work, for related reasons.\n\nConsider coal first. The Baker Institute writes at Forbes:\n\nGovernment regulations have very little to do with coal's problems. Repealing the CPP [Clean Power Plan, a regulation passed by President Obama] or opening federal lands to mining won't rescue King Coal from the drubbing it is receiving at the hands of cheaper, cleaner natural gas and wind power\u2026.
