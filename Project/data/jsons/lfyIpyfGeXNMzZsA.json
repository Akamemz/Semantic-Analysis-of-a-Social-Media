He doesn \u2019 t , \u201d said Thomas Sanderson , the director of the transnational threats project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . \u201c It suggests ... he simply doesn \u2019 t want to agree with the finding that Russia was behind this because it delegitimizes his campaign win . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s stiff statement came after the president-elect and his allies spent much of the day front-running the meeting and the report , downplaying Trump \u2019 s ties to Russia and calling on lawmakers to investigate leaked details of the report to news outlets .\nTrump himself Friday morning called all the attention paid to the hacks a \u201c political witch hunt , \u201d motivated , he claimed , by his political rivals and their sour grapes over his surprising win .\n\u201c They got beaten very badly in the election . I won more counties in the election than Ronald Reagan , \u201d Trump said of his political opponents in an interview with the New York Times . \u201c They are very embarrassed about it . To some extent , it \u2019 s a witch hunt . They just focus on this . \u201d\nJust before 1 p.m. , the full slate of intelligence chiefs arrived at Trump Tower : FBI Director James Comey , CIA Director John Brennan and NSA Director Mike Rogers . While Trump has not called out them by name on Twitter , he \u2019 s repeatedly disparaged their work , even claiming that his briefing had been delayed because they needed more time to build their case against Russia .\nTrump \u2019 s three-paragraph statement on Friday , issued at 2:34 p.m. after the meeting wrapped up , began on a conciliatory note .\n\u201c I had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community this afternoon . I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation , '' Trump said in the opening of the carefully crafted statement which pivoted quickly to the declarative statement at the heart of Trump \u2019 s effort winning the ongoing public relations battle over the legitimacy of the election that he won\u2014after he spent months last fall , preparing for a loss , asserting that it would be \u201c rigged . \u201d\nAfter noting that a number of foreign entities try to penetrate U.S. targets , Trump said that there had been similar attacks against the Republican National Committee but that those attacks failed because of the RNC \u2019 s \u201c strong hacking defenses '' \u2014 a topic the intelligence community did not address in Friday \u2019 s report .\nThis was the first time Trump acknowledged the possibility that Russia had hacked several American targets , including the DNC , something the nation \u2019 s top intelligence officials concluded in October .\nHe said he will appoint a team upon assuming the presidency responsible for creating a plan within the first 90 days of his administration to combat cyberattacks .\nSince October , the intelligence community has uniformly stated that Russia was behind those attacks , but Trump has been unwilling to concede that conclusion , pointedly casting doubt on the intelligence community at nearly every turn .\nIn a sign of the high tensions surrounding Friday \u2019 s meeting , both U.S. officials and Trump \u2019 s team attempted to get ahead of the meeting by airing their side of the story . Both the Washington Post and NBC News spoke to U.S. officials Thursday night , detailing at least some of the evidence proving Russia was behind the cyberattacks .
