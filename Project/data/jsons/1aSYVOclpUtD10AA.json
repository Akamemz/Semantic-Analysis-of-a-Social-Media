Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 11 , 2020\nProsecutors had recommended a tougher-than-normal sentence of seven to nine years in prison , which they wrote in a court filing would \u201c accurately reflect the seriousness of his crimes and promote respect for the rule of law . \u201d\nA sentencing recommendation is usually not a straightforward process . Prosecutors also take into account the offender \u2019 s criminal history , age , and whether they chose to take the case to trial \u2013 something that typically results in harsher sentences if convicted .\n\u201c I have never seen a prosecutor go in and undermine a jury \u2019 s verdict , \u201d says Laura Brevetti , a former Organized Crime Strike Force prosecutor with the DOJ .\nFor offenses like Mr. Stone \u2019 s , federal guidelines typically call for a sentence ranging from 15 to 21 months , though they can request more if the offender engages in additional questionable conduct .\nBefore his trial , Mr. Stone posted on Instagram a photo of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson , the trial judge , with crosshairs next to her head . During the trial , prosecutors wrote , he also appealed for a presidential pardon through the right-wing media .\nA senior DOJ official told media on Tuesday that the line prosecutor \u2019 s recommendation was \u201c extreme and excessive and disproportionate to Stone \u2019 s offenses . \u201d\nBut \u201c the underlying principles of punishment are you want to deter people , \u201d says Kami Chavis , a professor at Wake Forest University School of Law and a former U.S. attorney . \u201c We do want to deter people from lying to members of Congress . \u201d\nThe fact that the four prosecutors involved have since left the case , she adds , suggests they were \u201c uncomfortable with this high level of intervention that seems politically influenced . \u201d\nPotential for abuse is rife in both a president \u2019 s pardon power and their command of the executive branch . The fact that the Justice Department is part of the executive branch means there are two perpetual concerns , says Professor Bowman , author of \u201c High Crimes and Misdemeanors . \u201d\nOne concern is that a president will use the DOJ \u201c as a shield to himself and his friends. \u201d The other is that they will use the DOJ \u201c as a sword against his enemies . \u201d\n\u201c This president has indicated a disposition to do both , \u201d he adds . The Stone case \u201c is not out of the blue . This is not some one-off event . \u201d\nTwo weeks ago federal prosecutors backed off a recommendation of up to six months in prison for Michael Flynn , Mr. Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser , who he has praised as \u201c a wonderful person \u201d and \u201c a very good man. \u201d Prosecutors now support probation for General Flynn , who pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in the Russia inquiry .\nThe first pardon he granted was to Joe Arpaio , an early campaign supporter .

Col. Alexander Vindman , an Iraq War veteran on the National Security Council staff , and Gordon Sondland , the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union . Mr. Vindman \u2019 s twin brother , who also was assigned to the NSC , was also removed .\nJessie Liu , a federal prosecutor who led the Stone case , had her nomination for a post at the Treasury Department abruptly pulled this week by the White House .\n\u201c We all know what [ Trump ] is about and we all know what he is doing , \u201d says Ms. Brevetti .
