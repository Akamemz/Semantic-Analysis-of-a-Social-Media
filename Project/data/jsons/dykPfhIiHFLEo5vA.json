    "content": "President Barack Obama was furiously lobbying Democratic senators Thursday to back his trade agenda \u2014 and liberals like Elizabeth Warren were pushing hard to derail it .\nAs the trade bill was on the brink of collapse , Reid sat silently at his desk on the Senate floor \u2014 not lifting a finger to either kill the bill or help the president of his own party .\nIt was an oddly complacent posture for the Nevadan , considering the dominating presence he \u2019 s been atop the Senate Democratic Caucus for years . His restraint reflected how divisive the trade debate has become for the White House and progressives \u2014 as well as Reid \u2019 s desire to quickly move on to a more politically palatable issue . And by not continuing to press what almost surely would have been a losing hand , Reid \u2019 s bond with Obama appears to have persevered through the biggest clash between the White House and Senate Democrats in the six years of Obama \u2019 s presidency .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not going to affect our relationship , \u201d Reid said of the president during an interview Thursday . \u201c We \u2019 ve been to the dance together lots of times , and just because he didn \u2019 t take me home this time , I \u2019 m not mad at him . \u201d\nSitting back in his chair and wearing sunglasses covering his blinded right eye , a relaxed Reid was resigned to the outcome of the trade fight , which cleared a filibuster that he supported on Thursday . Reid said he \u201c tried not to be an obstacle \u201d to Obama \u2019 s trade agenda , even though he staunchly opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the \u201c fast-track \u201d trade bill .\n\u201c I knew what the outcome \u2019 s going to be for a long time , \u201d Reid said . \u201c In my caucus , we have a dozen people who have been pro-trade . That \u2019 s why I \u2019 ve been very careful in trying to understand them , and of course the vast majority of Democrats who are against the trade bill . So I \u2019 ve tried not to be an obstacle to the bill passing . \u201d\nAsked why he didn \u2019 t try to line up the votes to kill legislation he strongly opposes , Reid shrugged and said , \u201c Well , maybe I didn \u2019 t want to . \u201d\nHow the 75-year-old Reid handled the issue showcases the challenge of overseeing a caucus that \u2019 s still adjusting to minority status after huge election losses last fall . He \u2019 s had to balance the demands of liberal hard-liners and moderates who are hungry for compromise and blamed Reid \u2019 s tight grip of the legislative process for some of their political problems .\nReid is also contending , of course , with a president who is eager to solidify his legacy during his final two years \u2014 even if that means , at times , dividing his party on Capitol Hill . The tensions hit a high mark a few weeks ago when the president dismissed Warren as a \u201c politician like everybody else . \u201d\nReid said he wasn \u2019 t upset with Obama over the remarks .\n\u201c He was at some press event and spoke out , \u201d Reid said . \u201c He \u2019 s frustrated . I understand that , I \u2019 ve been that way a few times myself . \u201d\n\u201c This is not personal , \u201d she said in an interview . \u201c This is about issues that powerfully affect working families all across this country . \u201d\nWarren , who sits on Reid \u2019 s leadership team , defended the senior senator \u2019 s handling of the trade legislation . Should he have taken a stronger stand to buttress opposition ?\n\u201c He \u2019 s managing the caucus the way he should , \u201d Warren responded . \u201c He \u2019 s the kind of leader we need . He listens to all sides , and he stands up for what he believes in . \u201d\nSo far this Congress , Reid has succeeded , at times , in forcing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bend to his demands , notably to drop an effort to kill Obama \u2019 s immigration actions and fully fund the Department of Homeland Security . But his caucus has also had its share of missteps , such as its handling of a human trafficking bill that contained abortion language Democrats failed to notice .\nAnd after demanding that McConnell finish surveillance and highway measures before taking up the trade bill , Reid backed down , bowing to pressure from pro-trade Democrats .\nLast week , Reid lined up his caucus to oppose taking up the trade bill over concerns that enforcement issues were not being taken seriously , causing an embarrassing setback for the president . The next day , however , Reid and his successor , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , cut a deal to bring the fast-track bill to the floor in exchange for some concessions . Whether Democrats got anything significant out of the exercise is a matter of debate .\nStill , Reid contends that such deal-making would never have occurred if Republicans were still in the minority .\nReid is also contending , of course , with a president who is eager to solidify his legacy during his final two years \u2014 even if that means , at times , dividing his party on Capitol Hill . | John Shinkle/\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u201c If we think that something is good , we just move to it , we don \u2019 t mess around with it , \u201d Reid said . \u201c If we feel there \u2019 s things that should be slowed , we should slow them down , as we did on trade \u2026 We \u2019 ll continue to do that . But I wish I \u2019 d had 3 percent of the cooperation that I \u2019 ve given them when they were stopping everything . \u201d\nRepublicans and some moderate Democrats , though , say that \u2019 s a charitable interpretation of recent events . In fact , many of them say there \u2019 s been a noticeable uptick in pace since the GOP took over \u2014 after years of gridlock , the chamber has passed several bipartisan bills as well as a GOP budget the past few months .\nSome say flatly it \u2019 s because Reid is no longer in charge .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not impressed , \u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) said of Reid \u2019 s remarks . \u201c The Senate \u2019 s finally starting to work . And you know what ? The Democratic members are enjoying it , too , \u2018 cause they can actually do what they were elected to do . \u2026 I don \u2019 t agree with the revisionist history . \u201d\n\u201c Things appear to be moving along with Mitch , \u201d said one Democratic senator , who asked not to be named to avoid upsetting Reid .\n\u201c There are lots of strong , opinionated voices in the caucus , \u201d he said , \u201c but Leader Reid always does a great job listening to people , trying to bring people together and moving the caucus forward . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s true that the Republican Senate has been voting more than the last Congress . Just this year , the Senate has voted on more amendments through Thursday than during the same period in 2014 and 2013 combined . It has taken 185 roll call votes through May 21 , more than the 161 in 2013 and 131 in 2014 over the same number of days .\nBut new majorities frequently exhibit a youthful exuberance . When Democrats took the Senate in 2007 and made Reid the majority leader , the Senate ended up voting on more than 200 amendments . Through all of 2014 , the last year of the Democratic majority , Reid \u2019 s Senate voted on just 15 amendments \u2014 though both parties bore responsibility for the meager activity .\nThere are already signs McConnell \u2019 s Senate is struggling to keep up the pace set in January , when the GOP took up more than 30 amendments to legislation concerning the Keystone XL pipeline . Just two amendments apiece have been considered for the trade bill and an Iran nuclear deal review bill .\nReid said that \u2019 s the nature of running the Senate . Open debate is important , but the majority leader has to keep the process moving .\n\u201c I knew that would come , it had to , \u201d Reid said , referring to repeated moves by McConnell to shut down debate and limit amendments . \u201c It makes it obvious that things are not as easy as McConnell thought they would be . \u201d\nAnd perhaps not surprisingly , Reid is less than impressed with McConnell \u2019 s record as leader , saying several bipartisan bills that have passed were ones held up in the last Congress , sometimes by Republicans .\n\u201c The few things that have passed are things that we would have passed easily , \u201d he contended .\nFor Reid , the last several months have been some of the more personally challenging of his three-decade rise to the pinnacle of congressional power . On New Year \u2019 s Day , he was injured in a freak exercise accident at his Nevada home , breaking multiple bones and damaging his right eye .\nWhen he returned after multiple surgeries , he temporarily wore glasses with frosted shades over his injured eye .
