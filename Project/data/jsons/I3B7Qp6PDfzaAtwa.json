This duplication of effort and cost got one Arizona Senator up in arms .\nSenator John McCain ( R-AZ ) has been digging into this proposal since March , calling it , \u201c nothing more than a protectionist tactic funded at taxpayers \u2019 expense. \u201d Speaking as one of the few isolationists in the crowd , I \u2019 m all for a good protectionist tactic now and then , but this is a major expenditure of money going to no discernible purpose . Of all the industries in the country that face challenges in the modern era , catfish production doesn \u2019 t exactly leap to the top of the list . As the linked article demonstrates , repeated and extensive testing of catfish , both domestic and imported , have resulted in such low levels of contamination in each that it \u2019 s rated as a low-risk food .

Jeanne Shaheen , D-N.H. , and John McCain , R-Ariz. , plan to target one such program : an Agriculture Department catfish-inspection program that would cost $ 14 million a year in wasteful spending , they say\u2026 Repeal the provisions that set up the new program , GAO recommended , and the government would save about $ 14 million a year . Doing so is \u201c a matter of common sense , \u201d Shaheen said in a statement .
