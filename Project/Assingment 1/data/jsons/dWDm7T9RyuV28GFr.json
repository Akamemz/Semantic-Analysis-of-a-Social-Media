Barring a fresh crisis \u2014 and there are certainly a few that could arise \u2014 many economists expect growth to return to a fairly healthy level by next year as house prices and the stock market continue to rise and the jobless rate falls closer to its historic average of 5.8 percent.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Democrats ask: What debt crisis?)\n\nThe federal deficit is around half the size it was when the tea party reached its apex, due to tax hikes, spending cuts and stronger growth.\n\nConsumer confidence this week hit a level not seen since the financial crisis rocked the economy in 2008. And economists say there is enough time between now and when voters go to the polls next November for the improvements to actually be felt throughout the economy. Even conservative economists predict somewhat stronger growth next year, while left-leaning forecasters are borderline giddy.\n\n\u201cThe fact is the economy is probably going to look and feel very good next year,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThe most likely outlook for Obama and the Democrats is pretty good growth and employment rising strongly. If you step back and look at it, it\u2019s a hugely favorable scenario for them.\u201d\n\nObama landed himself in trouble early in his term for appearing to spike the ball too soon on economic growth. So he\u2019s hesitant to make that mistake again when growth remains fairly soft and joblessness is still at 7.5 percent. But he\u2019s shown signs of campaigning for the midterms on a message of a renewed prosperity \u2014 threatened only by Republican demands for more cuts and threats of fiscal standoff.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Private equity seeks 2014 do-over)\n\n\u201cIf you read the headlines over the last couple of days, you\u2019d actually see housing recovering; the economy stronger than expected; stock market hitting record highs,\u201d Obama said at a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Chicago this week. \u201cOur economy is doing better than just about every industrialized country in the world.\u201d\n\nAt another recent fundraising event in New York at movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s town house, Obama blamed GOP partisanship for blocking his efforts to improve the economy even more. \u201cMy thinking was after we beat them in 2012 that might break the fever,\u201d he said to a group that included singer Justin Timberlake and actress Jessica Biel. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite broken yet, but I am persistent and I am staying at it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats down the line are echoing that message and taking credit for progress while arguing that Republicans are standing in the way of a stronger recovery.\n\n\u201cHome values are going up and debt is going down, and all we are telling Republicans is: \u2018Don\u2019t screw this up,\u2019\u201d said Rep.

Rob Portman: Use debt limit as leverage)\n\nRepublicans, who are on comfortable terrain hitting Obama for slow job growth, have had more trouble shifting their message from one focused almost exclusively on austerity-style budget cuts to one reflecting a growing economy and at least a slightly sunnier national mood.
