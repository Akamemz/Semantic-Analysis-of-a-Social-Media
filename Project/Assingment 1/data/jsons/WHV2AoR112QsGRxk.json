    "content": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz set off a media firestorm last week by becoming the first to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination in 2016 . The media has generally described Cruz as a passionate , hard-line conservative and a polarizing figure . Writing for Fox News , Michael Goodwin argued that Cruz has a chance at becoming our next president , calling him \u201c a brilliant man of clear conservative convictions , not muddled by the politics of calculation. \u201d It \u2019 s a nice sentiment , but it also effectively illustrates the underlying problem with candidates like Cruz and with our political system in general : being \u201c muddled \u201d by a willingness to compromise is actually a trait we should pursue in a potential president , not vilify . Working on the problems we face as a nation requires considerable \u201c calculation , \u201d or reasoned , pragmatic solutions . What we don \u2019 t need is more blanket ideology , no matter how passionate .\nIn light of the government shutdown of 2013 , it \u2019 s been made clear that the blatantly dysfunctional nature of Congress is a serious issue . The 112th and 113th congressional sessions , our last two congresses , have been the two least productive\u2014in terms of bills passed\u2014in American history and scored the lowest approval ratings since 1974 , according to NBC . Political polarization lies at the root of this dysfunction , because as politicians move further and further away from each other , they lose their ability to find any reasonable middle ground . This undermines our democratic process by eliminating our ability to work together to find solutions to the problems we face . As a senator , Ted Cruz epitomizes the polarization of Congress in his inability to compromise ; the junior senator has passed just one bill so far , a unanimously supported , non-controversial effort to stop Iran \u2019 s envoy from entering the US .\nPossibly our biggest concern in 2008 was health care . A 2009 study from Harvard University found that 45,000 people died every year from lack of access to health care , and those who had no health insurance were 40 percent more likely to die of preventable causes . In response to this awful scenario , Congress passed the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , making health insurance affordable for low-income earners and closing loopholes that allowed health insurance companies to deny coverage . Obamacare was initially a compromise ; far more moderate than the single-payer system President Barack Obama championed in 2008 , it most closely resembled the health care system put in place by Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts . As a system that mandates minimum health insurance coverage and subsidizes it for low-income earners , Obamacare is ironically similar to the plan put forward by Senator John McCain during the 2008 election . But compromises that could potentially save thousands of lives don \u2019 t fit neatly within the confines of Ted Cruz \u2019 s far-right ideology ; Cruz championed the conservative pushback against Obamacare , filibustering its passage and shutting down the government in an attempt to defund the bill . Since then , Cruz has promised to \u201c repeal every word of Obamacare , \u201d bringing us back to the reality of 2008 , when health and life expectancy were a matter of finances .\nPerhaps most disconcerting about the stubborn nature of U.S. politics is our inability to act in the best interests of the country . Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. , where a shooter used a legally-purchased gun to kill 20 school children and six adult staff members , a bipartisan coalition of senators proposed legislation that would limit the number of bullets that can be held by a magazine and extend universal background checks to keep assault weapons from potentially dangerous individuals . Cruz , along with all but four senate Republicans and most southern Democrats , opposed all measures to reduce gun violence , with Cruz arguing that the Obama administration tried to use the shooting as \u201c an excuse to go after the constitutional rights of law-abiding senators \u201d and has continued to urge Republicans not to compromise on the issue . Before the vote , polls showed overwhelming support for universal background checks , including 92 percent of gun owners and 86 percent of Republicans supporting the bill . This was an opportune moment for politicians to answer their constituencies bring about meaningful change in public policy and hopefully reduce gun violence in the process . But Cruz is not motivated by a desire to lower the murder rate or decrease the number of mass murders ; rather , he is motivated to protect his exact ideology down to the letter , regardless of its effect on the lives of Americans . This is unproductive , harmful politics and the diametric opposite of what we need in 2016 .\nThere \u2019 s no doubt that liberals are also at fault for some of our political polarization . Liberal politicians can be just as unwilling to compromise as conservatives , and our twitterization of social politics has eroded conversations down to slogans . But Ted Cruz stands out as a particularly dangerous politician , the type to give ideological objections to pragmatic solutions and shut down our government rather than compromise on health care .\nWhen the time comes to pick a candidate for the 2016 election , I hope Democrats won \u2019 t merely endorse a liberal version of Ted Cruz in the future but will instead put forth a candidate who will fight arguments of shallow passion with arguments of substance .\nDespite our stagnant Congress , we \u2019 ve made some significant progress over the past eight years , bringing health care to millions of uninsured and cutting unemployment nearly in half . However , over 10,000 Americans continue to die from gun violence every year , and millions of Americans continue working full-time while requiring government assistance to live . The biggest challenge for our next president will be to build upon our successes while working to break down the polarization of Congress so we can move toward a more productive future and address those issues we still face .\nAs a senator , and now as a candidate , Cruz represents an undoing of all the progress we \u2019 ve made over the last eight years and a continued barricade to progress and compromise .
