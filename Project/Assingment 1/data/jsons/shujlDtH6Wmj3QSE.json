Barring a scandal or another extraordinary event that consumes Mrs. Clinton , his only way to beat her starts with a lightning strike : winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1 and then the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 . Such victories would instantly raise questions about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s strength and electability and provide political momentum , fund-raising energy and far greater visibility for Mr. Sanders in the next major contests , in states like South Carolina , Colorado and Texas , where he is not well known .\nBut Mrs. Clinton has been ahead in Iowa for three months , while Mr. Sanders has a slight lead in New Hampshire polls . Mrs. Clinton held a lead in Iowa in 2007 , too , before losing there to Mr. Obama . But he had far more endorsements from state leaders and a sharper line of attack against Mrs. Clinton ( over the Iraq war ) than Mr. Sanders has . Mrs. Clinton is vulnerable this time around on her ties to Wall Street , and there is also an opening for a candidate to run to the left of her on national security issues .\nBut Mr. Sanders , who has ruled out negative campaigning , has not done anything memorable on either front . When he did challenge her on Saturday , accusing her twice of being \u201c too into regime change \u201d to topple dictators and enemies , he did it as respectfully as possible \u2014 after which Mrs. Clinton hit him hard both times for voting to oust Col.
