In the United States , health officials believe more than 20 million people have likely been infected .\nA staggering 500,000 people around the globe have died in just six months . More people have succumbed to the virus in the U.S. \u2014 126,000 \u2014 than the number of American troops who died in World War I .\nBut even after months of painful lockdowns worldwide , the virus is no closer to containment in many countries .

We all want to get on with our lives . But the hard reality is this is not even close to being over , '' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday . `` Globally , the pandemic is actually speeding up . ''\nIn the U.S. , the fierce urgency of March and April has given way to the complacency of summer , as bars and restaurants teem with young people who appear largely convinced the virus poses no threat to them . New outbreaks , especially among younger Americans , have forced 16 states to pause or roll back their reopening plans .\n`` This is a really challenging point in time . It 's challenging because people are tired of the restrictions on their activity , people are tired of not being able to socialize , not being able to go to work , '' said Richard Besser , a former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) who now heads the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .\n`` You have people who have reached that point of pandemic fatigue where they just do n't want to hear it anymore , they just want to go back to their life , '' he added .\nThe number of new U.S. cases has risen sharply in recent weeks , led disproportionately by states in the South , the Midwest and the Sun Belt . More than a quarter-million people tested positive for the coronavirus last week , and more than 40,000 tested positive on three consecutive days over the weekend .\n`` We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day .

It deployed the world 's most successful diagnostics test , developed at a Berlin hospital , on a massive scale .
