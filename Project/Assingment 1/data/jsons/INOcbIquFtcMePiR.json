His father was a British-born , U.S.-educated field biologist who guided Canada \u2019 s regulation of DDT , an insecticide once hailed as a miracle substance but which became infamous for its toxic effects on the environment and humans .\nDr. Keith joined his father and stepmother , a biologist , on their field trips , and roamed 500 acres of woodland that his family partly owned . One of his uncles helped create the American Birding Association . His father \u2019 s colleague at the Canadian Wildlife Service who studied polar bears was a regular visitor at the family house . In high school , he hiked the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire solo .\nIn 1989 , as a physics Ph.D. student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , he landed on the idea of solar geoengineering as part of a group of ambitious science and policy graduate students at Harvard and MIT exploring climate change . \u201c It was a pretty unusual group . We were kind of ahead of our professors , \u201d he says . \u201c I started work on this topic simply because it was a topic somebody brought up and nobody was working on it . \u201d\nSoviet scientists at the Institute of Rainmaking in Leningrad had already studied the release of particulates in the atmosphere to reflect sunlight . But it was an idea that seemed to belong more to science fiction \u2013 a fantastical parable of hubris \u2013 than to the research academy .\nThat didn \u2019 t deter Dr. Keith , says Hadi Dowlatabadi , who at the time was a professor of climate policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a family friend . Dr. Dowlatabadi agreed to work with Dr. Keith on a paper that tried to model a deliberate intervention in the climate system . The report , published in 1992 , found a global cooling effect that previous studies had not . Solar geoengineering , in other words , appeared to work . This was not a popular idea at the time , says Dr. Dowlatabadi , who is now at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver .\n\u201c What David has always been keen on doing is trying to understand where the truth really lies , regardless of the political implications , \u201d he says .\nAfter completing his doctorate at MIT , Dr. Keith moved into other climate-related fields , from policy analysis to designing spectrometers for NASA aircraft . He also developed new ways to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide as a way to limit the effects of climate change . In 2009 , he founded a Canadian startup , Carbon Engineering , backed by Mr. Gates , that builds giant fans to suck carbon from the air .\nHe circled back to solar geoengineering after joining Harvard in 2011 as a professor of engineering and public policy . In 2017 , he became co-director of its Solar Geoengineering Research Program , which has raised $ 16 million so far . This has made him a lightning rod for critics of his lonely frontier of climate research .\nDr. Keith is an agile and forceful debater , and his blunt talk can raise hackles . \u201c Many people find him to be too direct and sure of his position . But it \u2019 s rare to find that he \u2019 s wrong in his position , \u201d says Dr. Dowlatabadi . As a scientist , though , he \u2019 s drawn to data and what can be proved .\n\u201c He comes across as having strong opinions , \u201d says Frank Keutsch , an atmospheric chemist at Harvard . \u201c But he \u2019 s entirely convincible . \u201d\nOn July 20 , 1816 , The Morning Post in London informed its readers that they were not alone in experiencing a chilly , damp summer . \u201c We continue to receive the most melancholy news from Germany on the extraordinary weather that afflicts nearly the whole of Europe . \u201d\nThat month , Mary and Percy Shelley arrived in Geneva after crossing a wintry France . \u201c Never was a scene more awfully desperate , \u201d she wrote . The weather kept them indoors and inspired a candlelit evening of writing ghost stories at the villa of fellow poet Lord Byron . That night , Ms. Shelley conjured up a Gothic tale about a scientist whose creation escapes his control : \u201c Frankenstein . \u201d\nThe \u201c year without a summer \u201d was a global weather event triggered by the eruption a year earlier of Mount Tambora in Indonesia . It burped clouds of volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere that over the next year would dim the skies over Europe , Asia , and the Americas .\nIwan Setiyawan/Kompas Images/AP/File In 1815 , the eruption of Indonesia \u2019 s Mount Tambora ( shown here in 2010 ) burped clouds of volcanic ash that altered the world \u2019 s climate .\nNearly two centuries later , Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines , spewing billions of tons of sulfur and other chemicals . Scientists estimate that eruption , in April 1991 , lowered global average temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius , roughly half the amount of warming seen over the past century .\nStratospheric clouds formed from volcanic matter are a form of naturally occurring solar geoengineering . Yet they are still an imperfect analog for what Dr. Keith is proposing . For his concept to be tested , he needs to get outside the lab . \u201c The only way you learn about the real world is to do experiments , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s how science works . \u201d\nFor the past seven years he has been trying to do just that at Harvard . The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment , or SCoPEx , would be the first such release of particles in the upper atmosphere ; other experiments have occurred in Earth \u2019 s lower atmosphere . The idea is to release tiny plumes of sulfur or limestone that can be monitored to see how they behave , data that researchers can then plug into computer models to determine the effects of large-scale geoengineering .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a number of things we don \u2019 t know , \u201d says Dr. Keutsch , who is leading SCoPEx . \u201c How do we get to this nice , even blanket [ of particles ] that we put in the [ computer ] model ? Is that even feasible ? \u201d\nWhich chemicals to release is a matter of debate . Volcanic plumes have shown that sulfur will form reflective clouds , but it is a pollutant that destroys the ozone , which filters harmful sunlight . Dr. Keith is excited by the idea of dispersing finely milled diamonds instead . Like limestone , diamonds may form reflective clouds that do the job just as well , without the sulfur side effects .\nBut diamonds wouldn \u2019 t stay up there forever . They would fall to the Earth , just as sulfur does as acid rain . Would diamond particles in the soil pose health risks ? How could we know ?\n\u201c This might actually mean that sulfur is the right thing [ to use ] despite all these other exciting things because ... it really is the devil we know , \u201d says Dr. Keith .\nThe experiment also poses significant engineering challenges . Dr. Keutsch is building a self-propelling gondola the size of a four-poster queen bed into which scientific instruments can fit . A balloon will loft it 12 miles into the air . After the release of the particles , the gondola then has to steer back and forth over the plumes to measure the results .\nSCoPEx wouldn \u2019 t pose any danger . The aerosols released would be tiny . In fact , your last airplane flight emitted more sulfur than this experiment would . But to critics of geoengineering , SCoPEx is frightening for what it symbolizes : a privately funded stealth move toward capricious climatic meddling .\n\u201c If there \u2019 s widespread recognition that this technology is not going to solve the climate crisis ... it makes little sense to invest in experimentation , \u201d argues Carroll Muffett , head of the Center for International Environmental Law , a Washington-based advocacy group .\nMoreover , he says , SCoPEx is testing the hardware needed for a future program , while Dr. Keith and others \u201c continue to publish papers on the economics of widespread deployment . \u201d\nTo defuse these and other ethical questions , an external advisory committee will review the experiment before it can proceed , and its advice , and the Harvard team \u2019 s responses , must be published . That could mean shelving a penciled-in launch in fall 2020 . \u201c I think it \u2019 s more important to do this slow and right than rush into something , \u201d says Dr. Keutsch . Otherwise it could become \u201c much harder for anybody else to do future experiments . \u201d\nGeoengineering is a broad term that encompasses many different ideas about how to intervene in the Earth \u2019 s climate system . One way is to seed oceanic clouds , which would help block the sun . Another is to spread silica beads over the polar ice caps to reflect the sun \u2019 s rays . Fertilizing ocean algae , a third option , could enhance the Earth \u2019 s absorption of carbon .\nSome of these methods , such as cloud seeding , would theoretically cool targeted areas of the Earth . Dr. Keith \u2019 s stratospheric approach would have global effects .\nThe argument for solar geoengineering is brutally utilitarian : the need to release pollutants to darken the skies , however risky , if the world doesn \u2019 t do enough to curb climate-related ecological devastation and human suffering .\nMatthias Schrader/AP/File Workers cover a glacier on Germany \u2019 s highest mountain with plastic sheets to reflect sunlight back into space and keep the ice from melting . It \u2019 s a form of geoengineering \u2013 deliberate human intervention in the climate of the Earth .\nBy most accounts , the sand is already pouring through the climatic hourglass . Despite fitful efforts by many nations , global emissions are still rising \u2013 the 2010s was the warmest decade on record \u2013 and rapid decarbonization seems a political non-starter in many countries . Perhaps more ominous , the planet could warm past the danger levels of 2 degrees C above preindustrial averages with just the stock of greenhouse gases that already exists in the atmosphere .\n\u201c Even if we got emissions to zero tomorrow , we \u2019 ve still got a big climate problem , \u201d says Dr. Keith .\nAt best , solar geoengineering might buy the world more decades for a social , economic , and technological transformation .\nPart of the allure of the idea is that it \u2019 s relatively cheap . In a 2018 paper , Wake Smith , a former aerospace executive who teaches at Yale University , estimated the development costs of a stratospheric fleet of sulfur-releasing aircraft at $ 3.5 billion . This theoretical program would start in 2033 with two aircraft and 4,000 annual flights , increasing over 15 years to nearly 100 aircraft flying hundreds of flights a week . With annual operating costs of roughly $ 2.25 billion , or slightly more than one-quarter of what Americans spend on pet food per year , such a program would be within the means of dozens of small and large countries , or even a rich individual .\nTo conservatives repelled by Green New Deal-style makeovers of the U.S. economy , that \u2019 s an attractive proposition . Last September , a Wall Street Journal columnist wrote a scathing review of the solutions of Democratic presidential candidates to climate change and zeroed in on solar geoengineering \u2013 \u201c throw a bunch of particles into the atmosphere , at a cost of perhaps $ 2 billion a year \u201d \u2013 as science \u2019 s answer .\nGernot Wagner , an associate professor of environmental studies at New York University and co-author of the 2018 paper , recalls how its findings , recast as a \u201c solution \u201d to climate change , ricocheted on social media . \u201c It went viral , \u201d he says . \u201c It was literally trending with the Kardashians for 18 hours . \u201d\nAt the time , Dr. Wagner was co-director with Dr. Keith of Harvard \u2019 s Solar Geoengineering Research Program . \u201c One of my biggest nightmares ... was Trump waking up one day at 4 a.m. \u2018 Right . Found a solution to climate change . Told you so . \u2019 \u201d\nIn 2013 , Dr. Keith published a book-length essay , \u201c A Case for Climate Engineering. \u201d The book was far more equivocal than its title , but it earned him a slot on \u201c The Late Show With Stephen Colbert , \u201d which Dr. Keith calls \u201c one of the more intimidating things that I \u2019 ve done . \u201d\nThat night , Dr. Keith wore a dark suit and a colorful shirt with no tie . Behind his desk , Mr. Colbert cut to the chase : \u201c How will we save the planet ? \u201d Dr. Keith outlined the basic idea behind releasing a shroud of sulfur particles in the stratosphere and what it might do to global temperatures .\n\u201c Blanketing the Earth in sulfuric acid , \u201d says Mr. Colbert , in a mock growl , his hands tracing a sphere . \u201c Because I \u2019 m all for it . This is the all-chocolate dinner . I still get to have my CO 2 and I just need to spray sulfuric acid all over the Earth . \u201d\nInsurers call this moral hazard : People tend to take more risks because they know they are covered by insurance . Could progress in geoengineering research lessen the urgency to cut global emissions ?\nThis is one of the chief criticisms of the concept by environmentalists and others , who see it as a dangerous distraction from the work of cutting global emissions . Critics worry about the uncertainty of it all , too : the damage hacking the climate could do to the planet . Indeed , one Oxford physicist has called solar geoengineering \u201c wildly , utterly , howlingly barking mad . \u201d\nAlan Robock , an environmental scientist at Rutgers University , has compiled a list of 27 concerns and risks of stratospheric geoengineering , from human and ecological impacts \u2013 disrupted monsoons , reduced solar power generation \u2013 to ethics and governance . That doesn \u2019 t mean he opposes Dr. Keith \u2019 s research . \u201c [ We ] have to quantify the benefits and the risks , \u201d he says .\nWho decides whether mankind should dim the sun , and under what conditions , are among the trickiest challenges . The Smith-Wagner study describes a slow ramp-up after 15 years of preparation for deployment . That could allow time to reach a global consensus on governance \u2013 say , with a U.N. resolution \u2013 and for cross-border scientific cooperation to foster partnerships .\n\u201c The world has to start talking collectively about this issue in an open and transparent way in the next few years , not later , \u201d says Janos Pasztor , a retired U.N. diplomat who directs the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Project .\nSeveral countries in Europe and Asia , including China and Japan , already have their own research programs . Dr. Keutsch wants to invite foreign researchers to put instruments on his stratospheric gondola so they can compare findings .\nBut what if a climate-related disaster strikes before a political consensus is reached ? One country , or a group of countries , could decide not to wait . \u201c It \u2019 s quite conceivable there will be unilateral action by one or more countries , for different reasons , \u201d says Mr. Pasztor . \u201c That has very substantial geopolitical implications . \u201d\nIndeed , the modest cost of deployment is what makes it hard to imagine that governments would pass up the option in a crisis , knowing that whatever multilateral action is taken on carbon reduction wouldn \u2019 t come quickly enough .\nAndres Forza/Reuters/File Walls of ice calve off a glacier in southern Argentina . To prevent the polar ice caps from melting , some scientists are studying using extreme measures , such as spreading silica beads over the poles to reflect sunlight back into space .\nThe geopolitical entanglements become even more complicated in deciding how much solar radiation should be deflected and then how to attribute the climatic events that follow . If devastating rains fall in China , is that the result of solar geoengineering or simply global warming ? If China decides it \u2019 s the former , then it could demand a halt \u2013 belligerently . Other countries will want to keep going , not least because a sudden stop would trigger a snapback in temperatures . It may be impossible to find common ground .\nAs Dr. Keith put it to Mr. Colbert , \u201c The big fear is that one country will want it one way and one will want it the other way , like two frat boys arguing over the thermostat . \u201d\nBack in his office , his wiry frame folded onto a sofa , Dr. Keith praises the young climate activists who are pressing world leaders to act on global warming now . As an environmentalist , he shares their outrage . He also puts a moral value on the stewardship of nature , of saving rainforests and polar habitats , that goes beyond their role in our climate system . Perhaps that argument has gotten lost , he muses , in the progressive pitch to voters that tough emissions cuts will make financial sense down the road .\n\u201c We have tried that argument and it hasn \u2019 t worked , \u201d he says . \u201c I \u2019 ve got to believe that people care about more than just their immediate self-interest . \u201d\nIn the end , the difficulty in finding a legitimate way to assess the risks of geoengineering and geopolitical conflict could mean that Dr. Keith \u2019 s research never leaves the lab . He says he \u2019 s fine with that . Perhaps carbon capture \u2013 his other passion \u2013 could take off , coupled with the rapid rollout of zero-carbon fuels powered by solar cells .

The report, published in 1992, found a global cooling effect that previous studies had not. Solar geoengineering, in other words, appeared to work. This was not a popular idea at the time, says Dr. Dowlatabadi, who is now at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.\n\n\u201cWhat David has always been keen on doing is trying to understand where the truth really lies, regardless of the political implications,\u201d he says.\n\nJacob Turcotte/Staff\n\nAfter completing his doctorate at MIT, Dr. Keith moved into other climate-related fields, from policy analysis to designing spectrometers for NASA aircraft. He also developed new ways to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide as a way to limit the effects of climate change. In 2009, he founded a Canadian startup, Carbon Engineering, backed by Mr. Gates, that builds giant fans to suck carbon from the air.\n\nHe circled back to solar geoengineering after joining Harvard in 2011 as a professor of engineering and public policy. In 2017, he became co-director of its Solar Geoengineering Research Program, which has raised $16 million so far. This has made him a lightning rod for critics of his lonely frontier of climate research.\n\nDr. Keith is an agile and forceful debater, and his blunt talk can raise hackles. \u201cMany people find him to be too direct and sure of his position. But it\u2019s rare to find that he\u2019s wrong in his position,\u201d says Dr. Dowlatabadi. As a scientist, though, he\u2019s drawn to data and what can be proved.\n\n\u201cHe comes across as having strong opinions,\u201d says Frank Keutsch, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard. \u201cBut he\u2019s entirely convincible.\u201d\n\nA volcanic effect\n\nOn July 20, 1816, The Morning Post in London informed its readers that they were not alone in experiencing a chilly, damp summer. \u201cWe continue to receive the most melancholy news from Germany on the extraordinary weather that afflicts nearly the whole of Europe.\u201d\n\nThat month, Mary and Percy Shelley arrived in Geneva after crossing a wintry France. \u201cNever was a scene more awfully desperate,\u201d she wrote. The weather kept them indoors and inspired a candlelit evening of writing ghost stories at the villa of fellow poet Lord Byron. That night, Ms. Shelley conjured up a Gothic tale about a scientist whose creation escapes his control: \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cyear without a summer\u201d was a global weather event triggered by the eruption a year earlier of Mount Tambora in Indonesia. It burped clouds of volcanic ash into the upper atmosphere that over the next year would dim the skies over Europe, Asia, and the Americas.\n\nIwan Setiyawan/Kompas Images/AP/File In 1815, the eruption of Indonesia\u2019s Mount Tambora (shown here in 2010) burped clouds of volcanic ash that altered the world\u2019s climate.\n\nNearly two centuries later, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines, spewing billions of tons of sulfur and other chemicals. Scientists estimate that eruption, in April 1991, lowered global average temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius, roughly half the amount of warming seen over the past century.\n\nStratospheric clouds formed from volcanic matter are a form of naturally occurring solar geoengineering. Yet they are still an imperfect analog for what Dr. Keith is proposing. For his concept to be tested, he needs to get outside the lab. \u201cThe only way you learn about the real world is to do experiments,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how science works.\u201d\n\nFor the past seven years he has been trying to do just that at Harvard. The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, or SCoPEx, would be the first such release of particles in the upper atmosphere; other experiments have occurred in Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere. The idea is to release tiny plumes of sulfur or limestone that can be monitored to see how they behave, data that researchers can then plug into computer models to determine the effects of large-scale geoengineering.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a number of things we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Dr. Keutsch, who is leading SCoPEx. \u201cHow do we get to this nice, even blanket [of particles] that we put in the [computer] model? Is that even feasible?\u201d\n\nDiamonds and sulfur\n\nWhich chemicals to release is a matter of debate. Volcanic plumes have shown that sulfur will form reflective clouds, but it is a pollutant that destroys the ozone, which filters harmful sunlight. Dr. Keith is excited by the idea of dispersing finely milled diamonds instead. Like limestone, diamonds may form reflective clouds that do the job just as well, without the sulfur side effects.\n\nBut diamonds wouldn\u2019t stay up there forever. They would fall to the Earth, just as sulfur does as acid rain. Would diamond particles in the soil pose health risks? How could we know?\n\n\u201cThis might actually mean that sulfur is the right thing [to use] despite all these other exciting things because ... it really is the devil we know,\u201d says Dr. Keith.\n\nThe experiment also poses significant engineering challenges. Dr. Keutsch is building a self-propelling gondola the size of a four-poster queen bed into which scientific instruments can fit. A balloon will loft it 12 miles into the air. After the release of the particles, the gondola then has to steer back and forth over the plumes to measure the results.\n\nSCoPEx wouldn\u2019t pose any danger. The aerosols released would be tiny. In fact, your last airplane flight emitted more sulfur than this experiment would. But to critics of geoengineering, SCoPEx is frightening for what it symbolizes: a privately funded stealth move toward capricious climatic meddling.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s widespread recognition that this technology is not going to solve the climate crisis ... it makes little sense to invest in experimentation,\u201d argues Carroll Muffett, head of the Center for International Environmental Law, a Washington-based advocacy group.\n\nMoreover, he says, SCoPEx is testing the hardware needed for a future program, while Dr. Keith and others \u201ccontinue to publish papers on the economics of widespread deployment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlow and right\u201d\n\nTo defuse these and other ethical questions, an external advisory committee will review the experiment before it can proceed, and its advice, and the Harvard team\u2019s responses, must be published. That could mean shelving a penciled-in launch in fall 2020. \u201cI think it\u2019s more important to do this slow and right than rush into something,\u201d says Dr. Keutsch. Otherwise it could become \u201cmuch harder for anybody else to do future experiments.\u201d\n\nGeoengineering is a broad term that encompasses many different ideas about how to intervene in the Earth\u2019s climate system. One way is to seed oceanic clouds, which would help block the sun. Another is to spread silica beads over the polar ice caps to reflect the sun\u2019s rays. Fertilizing ocean algae, a third option, could enhance the Earth\u2019s absorption of carbon.\n\nSome of these methods, such as cloud seeding, would theoretically cool targeted areas of the Earth. Dr. Keith\u2019s stratospheric approach would have global effects.\n\nThe argument for solar geoengineering is brutally utilitarian: the need to release pollutants to darken the skies, however risky, if the world doesn\u2019t do enough to curb climate-related ecological devastation and human suffering.\n\nMatthias Schrader/AP/File Workers cover a glacier on Germany\u2019s highest mountain with plastic sheets to reflect sunlight back into space and keep the ice from melting. It\u2019s a form of geoengineering \u2013 deliberate human intervention in the climate of the Earth.\n\nAffordable stopgap?\n\nBy most accounts, the sand is already pouring through the climatic hourglass. Despite fitful efforts by many nations, global emissions are still rising \u2013 the 2010s was the warmest decade on record \u2013 and rapid decarbonization seems a political non-starter in many countries. Perhaps more ominous, the planet could warm past the danger levels of 2 degrees C above preindustrial averages with just the stock of greenhouse gases that already exists in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cEven if we got emissions to zero tomorrow, we\u2019ve still got a big climate problem,\u201d says Dr. Keith.\n\nAt best, solar geoengineering might buy the world more decades for a social, economic, and technological transformation.\n\nPart of the allure of the idea is that it\u2019s relatively cheap. In a 2018 paper, Wake Smith, a former aerospace executive who teaches at Yale University, estimated the development costs of a stratospheric fleet of sulfur-releasing aircraft at $3.5 billion. This theoretical program would start in 2033 with two aircraft and 4,000 annual flights, increasing over 15 years to nearly 100 aircraft flying hundreds of flights a week. With annual operating costs of roughly $2.25 billion, or slightly more than one-quarter of what Americans spend on pet food per year, such a program would be within the means of dozens of small and large countries, or even a rich individual.\n\nTo conservatives repelled by Green New Deal-style makeovers of the U.S. economy, that\u2019s an attractive proposition. Last September, a Wall Street Journal columnist wrote a scathing review of the solutions of Democratic presidential candidates to climate change and zeroed in on solar geoengineering \u2013 \u201cthrow a bunch of particles into the atmosphere, at a cost of perhaps $2 billion a year\u201d \u2013 as science\u2019s answer.\n\nSocial media and Stephen Colbert\n\nGernot Wagner, an associate professor of environmental studies at New York University and co-author of the 2018 paper, recalls how its findings, recast as a \u201csolution\u201d to climate change, ricocheted on social media. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was literally trending with the Kardashians for 18 hours.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Dr. Wagner was co-director with Dr. Keith of Harvard\u2019s Solar Geoengineering Research Program. \u201cOne of my biggest nightmares ... was Trump waking up one day at 4 a.m. \u2018Right. Found a solution to climate change. Told you so.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Dr. Keith published a book-length essay, \u201cA Case for Climate Engineering.\u201d The book was far more equivocal than its title, but it earned him a slot on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d which Dr. Keith calls \u201cone of the more intimidating things that I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThat night, Dr. Keith wore a dark suit and a colorful shirt with no tie. Behind his desk, Mr. Colbert cut to the chase: \u201cHow will we save the planet?\u201d Dr. Keith outlined the basic idea behind releasing a shroud of sulfur particles in the stratosphere and what it might do to global temperatures.\n\n\u201cBlanketing the Earth in sulfuric acid,\u201d says Mr. Colbert, in a mock growl, his hands tracing a sphere. \u201cBecause I\u2019m all for it. This is the all-chocolate dinner. I still get to have my CO 2 and I just need to spray sulfuric acid all over the Earth.\u201d\n\nInsurers call this moral hazard: People tend to take more risks because they know they are covered by insurance. Could progress in geoengineering research lessen the urgency to cut global emissions?\n\nThe real work\n\nThis is one of the chief criticisms of the concept by environmentalists and others, who see it as a dangerous distraction from the work of cutting global emissions. Critics worry about the uncertainty of it all, too: the damage hacking the climate could do to the planet. Indeed, one Oxford physicist has called solar geoengineering \u201cwildly, utterly, howlingly barking mad.\u201d\n\nAlan Robock, an environmental scientist at Rutgers University, has compiled a list of 27 concerns and risks of stratospheric geoengineering, from human and ecological impacts \u2013 disrupted monsoons, reduced solar power generation \u2013 to ethics and governance. That doesn\u2019t mean he opposes Dr. Keith\u2019s research. \u201c[We] have to quantify the benefits and the risks,\u201d he says.\n\nWho decides whether mankind should dim the sun, and under what conditions, are among the trickiest challenges. The Smith-Wagner study describes a slow ramp-up after 15 years of preparation for deployment. That could allow time to reach a global consensus on governance \u2013 say, with a U.N. resolution \u2013 and for cross-border scientific cooperation to foster partnerships.\n\n\u201cThe world has to start talking collectively about this issue in an open and transparent way in the next few years, not later,\u201d says Janos Pasztor, a retired U.N. diplomat who directs the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Project.\n\nSeveral countries in Europe and Asia, including China and Japan, already have their own research programs. Dr. Keutsch wants to invite foreign researchers to put instruments on his stratospheric gondola so they can compare findings.\n\nBut what if a climate-related disaster strikes before a political consensus is reached? One country, or a group of countries, could decide not to wait. \u201cIt\u2019s quite conceivable there will be unilateral action by one or more countries, for different reasons,\u201d says Mr. Pasztor. \u201cThat has very substantial geopolitical implications.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the modest cost of deployment is what makes it hard to imagine that governments would pass up the option in a crisis, knowing that whatever multilateral action is taken on carbon reduction wouldn\u2019t come quickly enough.\n\nAndres Forza/Reuters/File Walls of ice calve off a glacier in southern Argentina. To prevent the polar ice caps from melting, some scientists are studying using extreme measures, such as spreading silica beads over the poles to reflect sunlight back into space.\n\nThe geopolitical entanglements become even more complicated in deciding how much solar radiation should be deflected and then how to attribute the climatic events that follow. If devastating rains fall in China, is that the result of solar geoengineering or simply global warming? If China decides it\u2019s the former, then it could demand a halt \u2013 belligerently. Other countries will want to keep going, not least because a sudden stop would trigger a snapback in temperatures. It may be impossible to find common ground.\n\nAs Dr. Keith put it to Mr. Colbert, \u201cThe big fear is that one country will want it one way and one will want it the other way, like two frat boys arguing over the thermostat.\u201d\n\nBig picture\n\nBack in his office, his wiry frame folded onto a sofa, Dr. Keith praises the young climate activists who are pressing world leaders to act on global warming now. As an environmentalist, he shares their outrage. He also puts a moral value on the stewardship of nature, of saving rainforests and polar habitats, that goes beyond their role in our climate system. Perhaps that argument has gotten lost, he muses, in the progressive pitch to voters that tough emissions cuts will make financial sense down the road.\n\n\u201cWe have tried that argument and it hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got to believe that people care about more than just their immediate self-interest.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the difficulty in finding a legitimate way to assess the risks of geoengineering and geopolitical conflict could mean that Dr. Keith\u2019s research never leaves the lab. He says he\u2019s fine with that. Perhaps carbon capture \u2013 his other passion \u2013 could take off, coupled with the rapid rollout of zero-carbon fuels powered by solar cells. The darkest near-term climatic scenarios may be averted.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
