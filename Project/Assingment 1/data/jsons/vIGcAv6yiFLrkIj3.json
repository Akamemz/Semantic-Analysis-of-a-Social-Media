Kelly , on her television show the Kelly File on Wednesday night , said : \u201c Donald Trump , with all due respect to my friend at 10 o \u2019 clock , will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days , which doesn \u2019 t exactly expand the tent . \u201d\nThe statement prompted Hannity to tweet : \u201c @ megynkelly u should be mad at @ HillaryClinton Clearly you support her .
