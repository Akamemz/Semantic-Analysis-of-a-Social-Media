    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump said Thursday that the USS Boxer downed an Iranian drone that came within 1,000 yards of the Navy ship and ignored `` multiple calls to stand down '' -- marking yet another escalation in the already tense situation playing out between Washington and Tehran .\nSpeaking at the White House , Trump said the drone was `` threatening the safety of the ship and the ship 's crew '' in the Strait of Hormuz and was `` immediately destroyed . ''\nThe drone was destroyed using electronic jamming , according to a US defense official .\nThe crew of the Boxer took defensive action after the drone came within a threatening distance of the US ship , the official said .\nA US Navy official told CNN that there were several other interactions between the US warship and Iranian military forces prior to the downing of the drone .\nAn unarmed Iranian navy Bell 212 helicopter flew close to the Boxer , coming close to the ship 's deck before a US helicopter was able to `` chase '' it away , the official said .\nSeveral Iranian speed boats were in the vicinity as well and maintained a safe distance , but a larger Iranian vessel came as close as 500 yards to the Boxer , a distance that typically merits a warning from US naval vessels , they added .\nIn response , US helicopters flew between the Iranian ship and the Boxer `` to warn it away . '' They also followed an Iranian aircraft , assessed to be a Y-12 surveillance plane .\n`` This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters , '' Trump said . `` The United States reserves the right to defend our personnel , our facilities and interest and calls upon all nations to condemn Iran 's attempts to disrupt freedom of navigation and global commerce .
