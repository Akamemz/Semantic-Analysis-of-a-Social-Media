    "content": "National media and Texas Democrats convinced themselves they had a winner\nWay back in 1996 , a little-known high-school teacher named Victor Morales won the Texas Demo\u00adcratic Senate primary . He beat two better-known and better-funded members of Congress , John Bryant and Jim Chapman Jr. , and Morales was the first non-white candidate for Senate to win the nomination of either party in state history . The media were enraptured with the tale of a humble teacher who put 60,000 miles onto the odometer of his dented white pickup , crisscrossing Texas , taking on incumbent GOP senator Phil Gramm .\nRichard Estrada of the Dallas Morning News wrote that \u201c Morales fairly oozes sincerity . He is the consummate outsider . In truth , Morales is not just a viable candidate , the enthusiastic re\u00adsponse he is receiving signals that he is a political phenomenon. \u201d The New York Times declared that Morales \u201c could energize Hispanic Democrats to turn out for him this November , maybe even providing major help for President Clinton here or for other Democrats . \u201d\nTexas Monthly tracked how Morales had become a media phenomenon : \u201c Morales has been profiled in the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times , USA Today , and the Miami Herald and on the Today show , Dateline , and CNN . Perhaps most important , he has sat for the obligatory , underdog-championing portrait in People . \u201d\nDespite all the hype about Morales , the race was never all that competitive ; Gramm went on to win by eleven points , one of the early chapters of a long , painful stretch for Texas Democrats . No Democrat has received more than 45 percent of the vote in a race for senator or governor since 1994 . Democrats , both inside and out of the Lone Star State , desperately want a candidate who could win Texas , because a Democrat who could win the state \u2019 s 38 electoral votes in a presidential race would end the competition before it began .\nIn past cycles , the yearning to be\u00adlieve in Texas Democratic candidates got national reporters to breathlessly hype the chances and potential of figures such as former Houston mayor Bill White , state legislator Wendy Davis , and former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro , and to tout the formation in 2014 of the progressive grassroots-organizing group Battleground Texas . \u201c There \u2019 s no doubt the group has put a scare into the long-dominant Texas GOP , \u201d declared MSNBC , a few months before Republicans had one of their best election days ever .\nThis is how the stage was set when Democratic congressman Beto O \u2019 Rourke decided to run against first-term incumbent senator Ted Cruz .\nThe national media started sending correspondents to hang out with O \u2019 Rourke , and just about all of them fell in love with him : Vanity Fair , Town and Country , Spin , GQ ( twice ! ) , BuzzFeed , Yahoo News , the New York Times , Rolling Stone , Time , the Washington Post ( twice ! ) , the Guardian , the Los Angeles Times , Bloomberg News , the BBC . . .\nCorrespondents seemed oddly fixated on his sweat . Politico swooned , \u201c Sweat pours off his lean , 6-foot-4-inch frame. \u201d In Vanity Fair , Peter Hamby described him \u201c sweating through a button-down shirt at one of his jam-packed town halls. \u201d The BBC wrote , \u201c His toes are well over the edge of the boards \u201d of the stage \u201c and his suede shoes are soaking up dark splashes of sweat from his brow . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s Texas .
