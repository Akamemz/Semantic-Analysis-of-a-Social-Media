Is that what the UK would do if a nation threatened a nuclear-tipped missile launched against any of the UK \u2019 s territories ? \u201d\nDamian Green , the UK \u2019 s first secretary of state , urged the Trump administration to use UN processes to resolve the crisis . \u201c It \u2019 s obviously in all our interests to make sure that nothing escalates , \u201d Green said on a visit to Edinburgh . \u201c We are very strongly in support of the UN process , which has and continues to put pressure on North Korea to stop acting in an irresponsible way . \u201d\nIn the event of a missile launch by North Korea , the US military faces the dilemma of trying to intercept the incoming missiles and risking humiliation if it fails .

But that wouldn \u2019 t be the case with \u2018 bracketing fire \u2019 , \u201d Pollack said in a thread of tweets . He argued that the exchange of threats and the missile plans underlined the need to open a military hotline between the US and North Korea to mitigate the dangers of catastrophic miscalculation by either side .\n\u201c If they do carry out that plan , both sides might discover that they need a crisis management mechanism sooner than not , \u201d Pollack said .\nQ & A What are North Korea 's nuclear capabilities ?

Japan 's defence ministry warned on 8 August that it was possible that Pyongyang had mastered miniaturisation .\nNorth Korea would also need a reliable delivery system for any bomb .
