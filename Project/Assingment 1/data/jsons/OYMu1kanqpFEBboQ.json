    "content": "One of Facebook 's early investors is urging users to wake up to what he calls the dark side of social media . Longtime tech investor Roger McNamee , who advised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in the early years of the company , now argues that Facebook is a threat to democracy , to public health , and to users ' privacy .\nIn his new book , `` Zucked : Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe '' ( Penguin ) , McNamee writes about how he became convinced that Facebook is `` terrible for America and needed to change or be changed . ''\nAppearing on `` CBS This Morning '' Monday , McNamee said Facebook and other internet giants like Google , have created products `` that essentially prey on the weakest elements of our psychology to create , first , habits , and then addictions . And then they did n't take the steps to safeguard us from what bad actors could do . '' The next generation of technology , he says , will only make the danger much greater .\nMcNamee credits Facebook 's success at creating a revolutionary social media platform , a boon for advertisers , as the heart of the problem . `` There 's never been anything like it for advertisers . They have essentially everybody on there , and they give you the ability to target very specifically . The same things that allowed the Russians to interfere in the Brexit referendum in the U.K. , and our elections , also allow advertisers to reach exactly the people they want to reach . When I want to sell my book , I advertise on Facebook and Instagram , because they are the place to reach people . ... Everybody is there , and we 're vulnerable when we 're on those platforms , '' he said .\n`` So , I 'm not surprised that the business is great . But that 's not the argument I want to have . I just want a conversation about the future of our children . We just saw twice last week Facebook was accused , in one case successfully in legal challenge , with respect to essentially taking advantage of minors with in one case credit card charges related to games , and in other case a product that spied on all their usage . ''\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Facebook said , `` We take criticism seriously . Over the past two years we 've fundamentally changed how we operate to better protect the safety and security of people using Facebook . The reality is Roger McNamee has n't been involved with Facebook for a decade . ''\nMcNamee challenged Facebook 's assertion that it has responded to notice of problems or of bad actors on the platform , saying there have been cases where Facebook has been called out and did not change .\n`` One of the most basic ones was the Department of Housing and Urban Development cited Facebook for advertising tools that allowed discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act , '' he said . `` Facebook claimed that they 'd fixed the product , and then Pro Publica did a series of studies that showed they had not done so .\n`` The Federal Trade Commission went after Facebook for essentially improperly failing to disclose to users what was happening to their data . And Facebook did not , in fact , follow through and do what the Federal Trade Commission asked . That 's how Cambridge Analytica happened . ''\n`` So , this is in fact a repeated problem . There 's been one great author , Zeynep Tufekci at the University of North Carolina , who characterizes Facebook as ' a 15-year apology tour , ' because their strategy is to maintain a black box where we ca n't really inspect what 's going on , and then just apologize and promise to do better .\n`` And my point here is that these products are so important that we need to have these investigations . Keep in mind : They have political power that dominates in this country and around the world .
