It \u2019 s not even a substitute for a decent argument . Yet mainstream journalism foregoes even this simple tool , available to all , in favor of simply pronouncing the world to be a certain way .\nThe Texas Tribune is guilty of this , and of misleading its readers and other journalists into believing that Houston is somehow to blame for its devastating floods . For those not familiar with the name , the Texas Tribune is a conflict of interest organized as a 501 ( c ) 3 . The Austin-based conference production/journalism outfit covers state politics , and takes lots of money from people who do business in the capitol . It covers for its biggest institutional backers , such as the University of Texas , while occasionally doing serious work that doesn \u2019 t threaten its bottom line .\nThis year , the Texas Tribune won Peabody and Murrow awards for a collaboration with ProPublica that blamed Houston \u2019 s flooding problems on global warming and unregulated overdevelopment .\nAs for the idea that global warming can be definitively blamed for disastrous weather , I think Richard Lindzen , an atmospheric science professor at MIT , said it best .\n\u201c The present temptation to attribute these normally occurring events to climate change is patently dishonest , \u201d Lindzen wrote . \u201c Roger Pielke , Jr. actually wrote a book detailing the fact that there is no trend in virtually any extreme event ( including tornados , hurricanes , droughts , floods , etc . ) with some actually decreasing . Even the UN \u2019 s IPCC acknowledges that there is no basis for attributing such events to anthropogenic climate change . \u201d\nBut I don \u2019 t want to litigate the climate change question here . It \u2019 s the other angle , that development is to blame for the flooding , that can be refuted rather easily .\nThe Texas Tribune has been flogging its take in its stories and on social media in recent days , telling readers to go back and read the prize-winners if they want to understand how and why Houston is flooding . And now the narrative has taken off , with the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Economist , Newsweek , Bloomberg Businessweek and others all running with some version of this claim , as phrased by the Economist :\n\u201c Although a light touch has enabled developers to cater to the city \u2019 s rapid growth \u2014 1.8m extra inhabitants since 2000 \u2014 it has also led to concrete being laid over vast areas of coastal prairie that used to absorb the rain . \u201d\nThe idea that pavement is to blame for Houston \u2019 s flooding is , to put it simply , idiotic , even comical . The daily journalists on their deadlines haven \u2019 t had time to realize how out of their depth they are , but the Tribune has no excuse for its shoddy reporting . The committees that awarded those prizes should be ashamed of their inability to spot the obvious hole in the narrative , which has been there all along .\nThe turf surrounding Houston is not , in the words of the county official the Tribune singled out for abuse , a \u201c magic sponge. \u201d Yes , it absorbs some water . Yes , of course , impermeable surfaces produce runoff . But no , absolutely not , no way , no how , could the clay and sandy soil around Houston have absorbed this deluge . The poor absorptive capacity of our soil is a matter of record , but that didn \u2019 t really matter . Even if our turf had the absorptive capacity of the Shamwow , Hurricane Harvey would have overwhelmed it .\nA study by the Harris County Flood Control District , which focused on the same Cypress Creek region that interested the Tribune , found that a residential development with 50 percent impervious cover would indeed absorb less water , creating more runoff . To be precise , the development would absorb exactly 1.79 inches less rainfall than an undeveloped property . But we got hit with up to 51.88 inches of rain during Hurricane Harvey . That \u2019 s more than rainy Seattle got all last year .\nSo even if the Tribune had had its anti-development agenda fully realized , it would have made no difference . The soil would have absorbed the first couple inches of rainfall , and the next 50 inches still would have had to go somewhere . Back in 1935 , when the area was almost entirely covered by natural wetlands , it still got flooded .\nHurricane Harvey put a third of Harris County , which includes Houston and some suburbs , completely underwater . The BBC shows us what that looks like . The Post gives us a sense of the scale .\nNow compare that to the extent of development in Harris County in recent years .\n\u201c Between 1953 and 1989 , 23,000 acres of freshwater wetland were lost in the Houston-Galveston Bay region . Since 1996 , another 19,000 acres of freshwater wetlands have been lost , \u201d scientist Erin Kinney writes .\nAnd what does all that development since 1996 look like ? This . Could those little specks of hardtop to the north of Houston redirect an ocean of water downtown ? The question answers itself .\nThomas Debo , a stormwater management expert at Georgia Tech , scoffs at the idea that open space is sufficient .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like taking an aspirin to cure an ailment , \u201d he says .\nCharles Marohn , an engineer , land use planner , and sometime hydrologist who publishes Strong Towns , has been for several years now one of the most interesting voices in the New Urbanism conversation . He \u2019 s very much on the side of planning and opposed to sprawl , so you might think he \u2019 d join all the journalists who are blaming Houston \u2019 s loose regulatory environment . Instead , he devastates their narratives with a single fact .\n\u201c The Texas A & M research I highlighted above suggests reckless wetland filling robbed Houston of 4 billion gallons of stormwater storage capacity , \u201d Marohn writes . \u201c For context , the Washington Post is reporting now that Harvey dumped 19 trillion gallons on the Houston area . That means that , had those wetlands never been filled , they could have accommodated 0.02 % of the water that fell in Harvey . \u201d\nSo if none of us lived here , and we tore down all our houses and roads , we could solve 0.02 percent of the problem . The Tribune is pushing nonsense , green fantasies dressed up as science .\nThe Tribune insists that \u201c experts say Houston-area officials could work to preserve green space ; strengthen regulation on development ; plan for a changing climate ; and work harder to remove the 140,000 homes that remain in the 100-year floodplain . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a Vietnam War mentality , isn \u2019 t ? We must destroy the homes in order to save them . Houses in floodplains may lose their value , but the problem we face is one of inadequate engineering , not overdevelopment .\nHouston and its suburbs sit on a flat , low-lying plain interspersed with bayous that receive water from tributaries and drainage channels . They all drain into the bay to the east . Almost all of our roads have ditches that run alongside and plug into the drainage network . If we had no improvements , the entire region would be susceptible to flooding at much lower levels of rainfall than Hurricane Harvey produced . But this drainage network works .\nMy town of Pearland , a suburb just south of the city , demonstrates how the practical approach works . Our longtime mayor is a retired engineer from NASA , and the city \u2019 s infrastructure reflects that . In 1990 , the city had a population of 16,000 and was mostly rural . But it has boomed to a population of 113,570 . According to the Tribune \u2019 s angle , all that additional development should have created a flooding problem , when actually we flood less than ever .\nIn 1997 , Pearland passed the first ordinance of its kind , requiring retention ponds in new developments . The developers built housing tracts with low-lying water features that served two purposes . They look pretty year round , but they \u2019 re dug deep to accommodate the torrential rainfall we get . Schools are built on large plots , with their vast lawns a few feet below building level ; the lawns turn into lakes when the rains come , but the buildings stay dry .\nThe city also builds its own ponds . We \u2019 ve got 143 of them around town , at least , and these saved almost all of us from water damage this week , when we got hit with 24 inches of rain in a single day . It \u2019 s a remarkable network . The ponds can be the size of 10 or 20 football fields , dug 10 feet deep , all interconnected by channels , and they all filled to the brim during this storm .\nI have a strong bias against city planning and zoning requirements in general , but I have to concede this point to the planners .
