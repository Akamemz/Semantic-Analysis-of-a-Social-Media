    "content": "The Trump administration has taken its war on abortion worldwide , cutting off all funding to any overseas organisation or clinic that will not agree to a complete ban on even discussing it .\nThe Mexico City policy , dubbed the \u201c global gag \u201d by its critics , denies US federal funds to any organisation involved in providing abortion services overseas or counselling women about them . It was instituted by the then US president Ronald Reagan and has been revoked by every Democrat and reinstated by every Republican president since .\nBut , under Trump , the net has been thrown wider and pulled tighter than ever . Sexual health organisations have said women will die as a consequence as they pursue dangerous DIY solutions or \u201c back street \u201d abortions instead .\nIn March , the US extended the gag , stating that any organisation counselling women on abortion and using funds from elsewhere \u2013 even from its own government or a donor in another country \u2013 will no longer be eligible for any US funding . The diktat applies to all global health organisations . HIV and children \u2019 s charities must sign up to the pledge , alongside those running sexual and reproductive health clinics .\n\u2018 We have to fight \u2019 : Alabama 's extreme abortion ban sparks wave of activism Read more\nWhat that means for organisations such as Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Federation ( IPPF ) is a blight on sexual and reproductive health services even in countries where abortion is never offered because it is illegal .\nEvery time the global gag has been reimposed by a Republican president , rates of back street and self-administered abortions sometimes ending in death have gone up , along with unwanted pregnancies . Two years since Trump \u2019 s original edict , on the day he came into office and in line with his pledge to religious groups he courted for votes , it is still early to assess the impact , but it is likely to be considerable .\n\u201c The global gag rule hits hardest the women living at the margins \u2013 the poorest , the most remote and those under 25 , \u201d said Ana Maria Bejar , the director of advocacy at IPPF . \u201c Progress can only be made when we can expand access for women and girls , not by reducing it .\n\u201c The policy has had a disastrous impact for IPPF in [ more than ] 30 countries . Tailored services for contraception , Zika information , maternal health , antenatal care , reproductive cancers , and HIV prevention and treatment felt the brunt .\n\u201c Any cuts to critical , affordable , high-quality , integrated reproductive healthcare is denying a woman or girl the right to decide what to do with her body , her life and her future . \u201d\nIPPF had 49 projects run by local member organisations in 31 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean , sub-Saharan Africa , and South Asia in January 2017 when the rule came in .
