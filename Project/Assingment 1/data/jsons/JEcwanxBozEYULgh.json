    "content": "The University of California at Berkeley 's inhospitality to conservative speakers , the subject of a federal lawsuit filed on Monday , prompted a Twitter rebuke from President Trump a few months ago . Yet his administration seems determined to demonstrate that suppression of opposing views is a bipartisan impulse .\nBerkeley College Republicans ( BCR ) , which invited conservative commentator Ann Coulter to speak on campus this Thursday evening , and Young America 's Foundation ( YAF ) , which underwrote her visit , argue that Berkeley 's vague , unwritten policy regarding `` high-profile speakers '' unconstitutionally discriminates against unpopular viewpoints . As a result of that policy , which was adopted after violent protests prompted the university to shut down a February 1 appearance by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos , Berkeley canceled Coulter 's speech , then offered to reschedule it for next Tuesday afternoon , in the middle of the `` dead week '' between classes and exams .\nBCR says it felt compelled to cancel an April 12 talk by another conservative journalist , David Horowitz , after the university insisted that it take place at an inconvenient location and end by 3 p.m. , meaning most students would be in class while Horowitz was speaking . BCR and YAF say the restrictions imposed by Berkeley in the name of public safety have not been applied to left-leaning speakers and amount to an `` unlawful heckler 's veto '' that marginalizes conservative voices .\nAfter the Milo melee in February , Trump suggested on Twitter that Berkeley risks losing federal funds if it `` does not allow free speech . '' If the president were sincerely committed to protecting First Amendment rights , he would issue similar warnings to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , which recently demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of a DHS gadfly , and the Justice Department , which is considering criminal charges against people who share classified information leaked by others .\nLast month a special agent in charge at Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) , a division of DHS , issued a summons to Twitter seeking records that would unmask the person or persons behind @ ALT_USCIS , an account that regularly criticizes the Trump administration 's immigration policies . There did not seem to be any legal justification for the summons , which looked like a blatant attempt to intimidate critics .\nDHS dropped the summons the day after Twitter filed a lawsuit arguing that it threatened the First Amendment right to engage in pseudonymous political speech . Last week , in response to inquiries by Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , DHS Inspector General John Roth revealed that his office is investigating whether the CBP summons was `` improper . ''\nThe day before Roth expressed concern about government inquiries that might have `` a chilling effect on individuals ' free speech rights , '' CNN and The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department is once again looking for a way to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for sharing classified documents with the public .
