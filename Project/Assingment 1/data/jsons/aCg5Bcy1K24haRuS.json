But it might take until the next presidential cycle to answer the most pressing question : Is Republicans \u2019 2014 success the result of significant changes in how voters view the two parties , or is the structural difference between the electorates in presidential and midterm years so great that Democrats still maintain a strong demographic advantage going into 2016 ?\nAfter a series of discussions with political experts , pollsters and strategists , here are the five things we learned about American voters this year .\nAfter two years of warnings about Republicans \u2019 woeful performance among nonwhite voters in 2012 , the midterms showed that Democrats have their own significant demographic vulnerability : working-class white voters . Republicans won white voters without a college degree by 30 points , 64 percent to 34 percent , according to exit polls , equal to their margin in the wave election of 2010 . Polling data show that support for President Barack Obama among working-class whites has dropped 8 points since 2010 .\nA new and potentially more popular steward of the Democratic Party \u2014 most notably , Hillary Clinton \u2014 might boost those numbers . But some say the party needs to embrace economic populism after an administration that has prioritized the Affordable Care Act and the environment over a platform focused on wages and other \u201c pocketbook \u201d issues .\n\u201c Democrats have chosen to focus on issues that the liberal base of the party really likes , but the working-class person in West Virginia or Arkansas or Louisiana or Alaska doesn \u2019 t necessarily identify with , \u201d said political analyst Charlie Cook .\nCook pointed to those four states \u2014 where Republicans captured Democratic-held Senate seats this year \u2014 to argue that Democrats are a \u201c marginalized party \u201d across much of the country .\n\u201c This is more than just a bad year for Democrats , \u201d he said . \u201c The challenge that the Democratic Party has in parts of the country appears to be even more formidable than it was two years ago . \u201d\nAdded former Rep. Dan Glickman ( D-Kan. ) : \u201c Democrats really gave up on small towns and exurban America . \u201d\nAnd even though Republicans have yet to make significant inroads among minorities , the GOP could make up for those losses by further enhancing its performance among white voters .\n\u201c Given what \u2019 s happening with working-class voters and how disenchanted they are with the Democratic Party \u2026 Republicans still have a chance to win the presidency without [ making ] significant changes to policy , \u201d said GOP consultant Ford O \u2019 Connell .\nDemocrats won \u2019 t necessarily be able to count on the same level of minority turnout in 2016 without Obama . At the same time , Mitt Romney in 2012 won a larger share of the white vote than any GOP nominee since George H.W . Bush and still lost the presidency .\n2 . Lax campaign finance laws are further separating the American electorate from candidates .\nIn 29 federal races this year , outside groups outspent the candidates themselves , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .

Liberals , meanwhile , increased their \u201c dark-money \u201d spending from $ 10.7 million in 2010 to $ 33 million in 2014 , according to CRP .\nDemocratic operatives earned considerable praise for their turnout operation in 2012 , but again the party suffered a midterm thrashing in large part because young and minority voters again stayed home .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t win on turnout when you have already lost on message , \u201d said Republican pollster Glen Bolger . Referring to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2019 s \u201c Bannock Street Project \u201d turnout operation , he added , \u201c Tactics are important , but if the voters are against you , it doesn \u2019 t matter what cool street name you give your turnout project , it \u2019 s not going to overcome anger among independents and apathy among your base . \u201d\nTurnout in the midterm elections was at its lowest level since 1942 , a major point of concern for Democrats .\nExperts note that the \u201c boom-and-bust \u201d Democratic coalition \u2014 a term used by Ronald Brownstein to note the great disparity between turnout in the presidential and midterm years \u2014 suggests 2014 might have little bearing on 2016 turnout .\nThe 36.4 percent turnout rate in November is yet another sign of an American electorate that has all but given up on Washington and federal institutions .\nVoters were upset and disillusioned in 2014 , and experts warn of the deleterious effects that can have on Washington moving forward .\n\u201c The dramatic drop in turnout could be an anomaly .

The Democrats\u2019 working-class-whites problem is serious.\n\nAfter two years of warnings about Republicans\u2019 woeful performance among nonwhite voters in 2012, the midterms showed that Democrats have their own significant demographic vulnerability: working-class white voters.
