Mike Pompeo left the door open to returning to harsh interrogation techniques , and collecting massive amounts of American data .\nIn newly released written answers to lawmakers \u2019 queries , the Kansas Republican says if confirmed , he \u2019 ll ask if the CIA feels current interrogation techniques are producing results\u2014and if not , he \u2019 ll consider asking for changes . He also says if CIA officers tell him that recent legal limits on data collection , passed after the Snowden leaks , are making it harder for them to do their jobs , he \u2019 ll recommend changes there too .\nThe answer on interrogating detainees appears to be Pompeo \u2019 s third position on the matter in as many years . In 2014 , he spoke up in favor of harsh interrogation . In his confirmation hearing , he said he \u2019 d never ask his officers do something like that . Now , in his written answers , he \u2019 s holding the door ajar for re-introducing the controversial methods .\np.p1 { margin : 0.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px ; font : 12.0px 'Times New Roman ' ; -webkit-text-stroke : # 000000 } span.s1 { font-kerning : none }\nHarsh interrogation of detainees\u2014along with the collection of American \u2019 s data even if they aren \u2019 t involved in a crime\u2014are legislative third rails for Democrats , but are unlikely to derail Pompeo \u2019 s eventual confirmation with a full Senate vote scheduled for Monday . But they mark the start of battles to come , as the Trump administration seeks to roll back legislation his supporters say has tied their hands in the fight against terrorists .\nThe delay of the CIA vote and others drew a rebuke from President Trump , who called on \u201c members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees , \u201d in a statement after his Defense and Homeland Security chiefs were sworn in Friday evening .\nSen. Richard Burr ( R-NC ) , the Senate intelligence committee chairman piled on , aiming his ire at an unnamed senator for delaying a Friday vote to confirm Pompeo . \u201c This will leave the CIA without a permanent director in a period of heightened threats to the United States and our interests abroad , \u201d he said , adding that Pompeo \u2019 s vote would proceed on Monday . ( Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer from New York asked the Trump administration to keep CIA chief John Brennan on for the weekend until Pompeo could be confirmed , but the new administration refused , Schumer \u2019 s spokesman Matt House emailed to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Friday . )\nPresident Trump said Pompeo was his only pick for the job , in remarks as he visited CIA headquarters at Langley on Saturday . He also accused the \u201c dishonest media \u201d for making it seem like he was feuding with the intelligence community , putting distance between himself and his comments since winning the election , when he blamed intelligence chiefs for allegedly leaking the unflattering and unverified private intelligence report that claimed Russian agents had gathered \u201c kompromat \u201d \u2013 compromising material \u2013 on him .\n\u201c I think it was disgraceful , disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out there , \u201d Trump said in his first press conference as president election , adding that it was something Nazi Germany would do .\nOn Saturday , he told the 400 or so CIA officers assembled before the memorial wall for fallen officers that he \u2019 s \u201c with you 1000 percent , \u201d adding that \u201c probably everybody in this room voted for me ... because we \u2019 re all on the same wavelength . \u201d\nThree senators put tough questions to the Trump nominee\u2014former intelligence committee chair California Democrat Dianne Feinstein , Maine Independent Angus King , and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden .\nFeinstein asked if Pompeo thought waterboarding and other \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d used by CIA personnel like stress positions , forced nudity , slamming detainees into walls or slapping and hitting them constitute torture .\nAt his confirmation hearing , Pompeo had said he would \u201c absolutely not \u201d comply with an order from Trump to resume the use of harsh interrogation techniques like waterboarding , considered torture under international law .\n\u201c Moreover , I can \u2019 t imagine that I would be asked that , \u201d the Kansas lawmaker said . Past CIA directors have said their officers would never agree to return to the Bush-era interrogation program , because though they were told what they were doing was legal at the time , some of those involved were investigated by the Obama Justice Department and are still fighting legal action by human rights and other activist groups .\nIn his written answers to the Senate Intelligence Committee , however , Pompeo now says he \u2019 ll consult with CIA experts as to whether the methods in the U.S. Army Field Manual\u2014the standard that now governs all federal agencies\u2014are sufficient . Or as he puts it , he \u2019 ll ask them if the manual is \u201c an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country. \u201d If the answer is yes , he says he may work with legal experts and congressional oversees to make changes\u2014though he stressed he \u2019 d make sure those changes stay \u201c within the law . \u201d\n\u201c He left open the possibility that the army field manual could be changed , \u201d said Laura Pitter , a legal expert at Human Rights Watch . The group is calling for senators to reject Pompeo \u2019 s nomination . \u201c He was not unequivocal about disavowing torture in the future . Coupled with his expressed support of enhanced interrogation techniques in the past , it leaves open the possibility that he would be open to the CIA carrying out these practices again in the future . \u201d\nJames Mitchell , a civilian contractor for the CIA who interrogated \u2014 and waterboarded \u2014 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( KSM ) , argues that going beyond the Army Field Manual makes sense with a small handful of hardened terrorists .\n\u201c Rapport building didn \u2019 t work on KSM , \u201d Mitchell told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview Saturday . Mitchell argues in his book about the program \u2014 as former CIA chiefs like ret . Gen. David Petraeus have argued before him \u2014 that lawmakers should help the CIA formulate legal techniques \u201c somewhere between waterboarding and the army field manual \u201d to be used in a \u201c ticking time bomb situation , \u201d so that CIA field teams don \u2019 t have to .\n\u201c The point I would make to the president in a situation where you have credible intelligence that there is going to be another attack , and you have that person in custody , you have to be able to go beyond the manual , \u201d said Mitchell , who is still being sued by the ACLU for taking part in the interrogation program . \u201c Are we going to stand around a big old smoking hole and congratulate ourselves for our moral high ground ? \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a point of view Pompeo is likely to take seriously . In 2014 , Pompeo had denounced the end of the interrogation program . \u201c President Obama has continually refused to take the war on radical Islamic terrorism seriously\u2014from ending our interrogation program in 2009 to trying to close Guantanamo Bay , \u201d he said in a statement .\nPompeo has similarly argued against the Obama administration \u2019 s rollback of the collection of Americans \u2019 metadata , in a response to the leaks of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden . In a January 2016 Wall Street Journal op-ed he co-authored , Pompeo called on Congress to bring back \u201c the collection of all metadata , and to combine it with publicly available financial and lifestyle date in a comprehensive , searchable database . \u201d\nWhile he told senators in the hearing that he knows that \u2019 s illegal\u2014and he voted for the current law that trimmed NSA \u2019 s collection of such records\u2014he \u2019 d recommend changes to that policy if CIA officers tell him their work is being hampered by current law .\n\u201c If agency officials inform me they believe the current programs and legal framework are insufficient to protect the country , I would make appropriate recommendations for any needed changes to laws and regulations , \u201d he writes , in a response to a question from Wyden .\n\u201c The answers are deeply disappointing to the point of being evasive , \u201d said Human Rights Watch surveillance researcher Sarah St. Vincent . \u201c They suggest that even though he voted for the USA Freedom Act ( which curtailed NSA collection of U.S. metadata ) , he has every intention of pressing the US government to re-adopt mass surveillance . \u201d\nWyden also pressed Pompeo on whether he \u2019 d be open to receiving mass amounts of metadata from a foreign government on U.S. persons . Pompeo had carefully said in the hearing that he wouldn \u2019 t ask for it , but not that he would reject it if offered .\n\u201c Wyden is concerned that Pompeo is open to receiving large amounts of data that would be an end run around the 4th Amendment , \u201d as that may include not only metadata but actual content ( like recorded phone calls or emails ) , St. Vincent said .\nWhile the Kansas Republican \u2019 s answers have troubled some Democrats , the former member of the House Intelligence Committee has been welcomed at the CIA , where insiders say initial meetings have gone well .\nOne answer that may somewhat mollify his Democratic detractors : Pompeo \u2019 s newfound understanding of WikiLeaks \u2019 role in Russia \u2019 s campaign to influence the U.S. election . Back in July , the lawmaker tweeted that hacked Democratic National Commitee emails posted by the group were \u201c proof that the fix was in from Pres . Obama on down . \u201d\nSince then , the Intelligence Community has released its assessment that Russia was responsible for breaking into the DNC \u2019 s email system , and for providing those documents to WikiLeaks . In his written statement , Pompeo said the tweet was \u201c not meant as an endorsement of WikiLeaks or its practices , but rather remarked on the content of the material now in the public domain . \u201d\n\u201c The tweet was sent in reference to political issues in the middle of a hard-fought campaign , \u201d he added . \u201c Based on additional briefings and information , including the reports released by the Intelligence Community , I now have a much deeper understanding of WikiLeaks and its harmful activities . \u201d\nThis story was updated 01/21/17 to add President Trump 's visit to the CIA on Saturday , comment from former CIA contractor James Mitchell , and to add that foreign intelligence agencies may share content as well as metadata with U.S. intelligence agencies .",
