    "content": "In the new House of Ryan , where lawmakers have been promised a greater say in legislating , members burned the midnight oil this week as they worked through scores of amendments to overwhelmingly pass a six-year , bipartisan highway bill on Thursday .\nIt was the first long-term bill in a decade to repair America \u2019 s crumbling roads , bridges , and transit systems , and members jumped at the new opportunity to give their input .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of pent-up , legislative energy around here , and when a real piece of legislation comes along that impacts every district in America dramatically \u2026 then a lot of people have a lot of ideas , \u201d says Rep. Peter DeFazio ( D ) of Oregon , the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee and lead co-sponsor of the bill .\nThe past few days have taught a lesson : patience . But ask Congressman DeFazio , and he 'll say the patience needed to bring this bill to reality has been measured in years , not hours or days . He \u2019 s been working toward this day since he was named a subcommittee chairman in 2007 . His own president resisted his efforts . Then the House changed hands .\nEven now , he acknowledges , the bill is n't what he wanted , since it keeps spending flat and is funded for only three years . But after such a long slog , he 's pleased . \u201c I \u2019 ve never really stopped working on it . \u201d\nIn life , patience is a virtue , and on Capitol Hill , doubly so . Congress was never designed for the quick fix . The Founding Fathers deliberately created two very different chambers so that there would be an opportunity for \u201c second thoughts , \u201d as former Senate historian Don Ritchie puts it .\nTurning ideas into a workable form and winning backing for a bill as big as this requires educating members , hearing them out , negotiating , and working with outside interests . It can take years to get to yes .\nYet that \u2019 s easily forgotten or dismissed by some newcomers . This is especially true in the age of Twitter , when voters know instantly what their senator or representative did \u2013 or didn \u2019 t do \u2013 and then make their demands for instant results immediately known .\nConsider freshman Sen. Marco Rubio ( R ) of Florida , a man in a hurry to become president . He got fed up with the slow pace of the Senate , where in his first year in 2011 he asked in a floor speech , \u201c Do we just stand around and do nothing ? \u201d\nFor lawmakers who were once top dogs at home \u2013 Senator Rubio was speaker of the House in Florida \u2013 it \u2019 s frustrating to arrive as a pup in a slow-moving Congress that values seniority .\nIn his early years , Rubio was left to author symbolic resolutions such as one that congratulated the Miami Heat for their NBA championship . He got his big break when he joined the \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d senators who pushed bipartisan immigration reform through the Senate in 2013 . Then he watched it die slowly from neglect in the House .\nIf he \u2019 s elected president , \u201c we can begin to fix some of these issues that I \u2019 ve been so frustrated we \u2019 ve been unable to address during my time in the Senate , \u201d Rubio told NBC \u2019 s Matt Lauer recently .

But patience is what makes all things real . \u201d\nA subtle dig at the hard-line , rebellious Freedom Caucus , who drove him out of the speakership ?\n\u201c When you get people who are impatient and ideologically driven , they feel like fish out of water \u201d in Congress , says former House historian Raymond Smock . \u201c The truth of the matter is , they are , because ideology is the opposite of pragmatism . \u201d\nA functioning Congress requires its members to want to govern , Mr. Smock says .
