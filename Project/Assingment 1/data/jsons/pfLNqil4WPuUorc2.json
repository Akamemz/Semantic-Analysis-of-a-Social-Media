    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) In a moment of unrestrained demagoguery , President Donald Trump presided Wednesday over a crowd chanting `` Send her back ! Send her back ! '' about an American Muslim congresswoman who he targeted with racist attacks .\nThe scenes at a North Carolina rally provided an ugly overture to a 2020 election campaign already soaked in hate . They exemplified the tribal politics and white nationalism that Trump is making clear he plans to ride to reelection , no matter their impact on America 's fragile societal harmony .\nThe chants of `` Send her back ! '' referred to Somalia-born , American citizen Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota , one of four minority lawmakers attacked by Trump over the weekend . The invective from the crowd replaced the `` Lock her up ! '' and `` Build the wall ! '' chants of Trump 's first campaign with a jarring racial refrain that the commander-in-chief , speaking from behind a podium bearing the symbolic presidential seal , made no effort to stop .\nReinforcing days of attacks on the four progressive Democratic women , known as `` The Squad '' on Capitol Hill , Trump questioned their patriotism and highlighted some of their controversial comments on issues including Israel , law enforcement and the September 11th terrorist attacks , in some cases distorting their records .\n`` They do n't love our country . They are so angry , '' Trump said , lambasting the group as `` hate filled extremists . ''\n`` If they do n't like it let them leave , let them leave , '' Trump said .\nOther presidents , like Richard Nixon for instance , have used veiled racial messaging in elections . But there is no modern equivalent of a US president so openly encouraging racial and tribal undercurrents on the campaign trail in order to consolidate his own power .\n`` We 've had racist presidents , '' CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali said on `` Anderson Cooper 360 . ''\n`` But they did not express their racism as head of state , the way that Donald Trump through his actions -- most importantly the tweets the other day and how he responded to Charlottesville -- the way that President Trump has done . ''\nDemocratic presidential candidates reacted to the menacing scenes by saying they showed why Trump must be driven from office .\n`` It 's vile . It 's cowardly . It 's xenophobic . It 's racist . It defiles the office of the President , '' California Sen. Kamala Harris wrote on Twitter .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden tweeted , `` Mr President , I am here to tell you this . This is OUR country . The United States of America . You 'll never understand what makes us strong . ''\nEven Rep. Adam Kinzinger , an Illinois Republican , tweeted Thursday that the chant `` would send chills down the spines of our Founding Fathers '' and said `` this ugliness must end . ''\nThe President was making his first appearance on the trail since escalating his attempt to make the group of congresswomen of color , who are well to the left of most liberals and who in some cases have their own history of inflammatory rhetoric -- a proxy for the entire Democratic Party .\nThe showdown is revealing the central question of the 2020 election campaign . Will Trump 's embrace of searing racial grievances , tough immigration commentary and rhetorical targeting of non-white adversaries that helped electrify his mainly white , blue-collar base and win the White House in 2016 deliver him a second term ?\nOr will the tactic drive away some moderate , suburban voters around cities such as Philadelphia , Detroit and Milwaukee who he needs to return to his fold to keep a similarly narrow path to victory open in 2020 ? And while it is likely to solidify Trump 's base , will such an approach ignite record breaking Democratic turnout ?\nEvidence from the midterm elections in 2018 suggests that Trump 's scorching immigration rhetoric worked in deep red Republican states . But it backfired elsewhere as Republicans lost the House . According to CNN exit polls , only 23 % of respondents who voted Democratic said immigration was their greatest concern . And health care , on which Democrats based their campaign , was the defining issue of the election and for 41 % of voters .\nStill , though the midterms were a referendum on Trump , he was n't on the ballot -- a factor that means that the lessons of 2018 can not be simply transferred to 2020 .\nAnd there is another variable in 2020 that could be decisive : Hillary Clinton will not be involved . The Democratic nominee was a hugely polarizing force as she carried her own immense political baggage and as well as that of a pair of two-term Democratic presidents -- Bill Clinton and Barack Obama -- on her back .\nThe President lost the popular vote and only carried the three crucial swing states -- Michigan , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- by a combined total of less tha n 100,000 votes . A less controversial Democratic nominee would make Trump 's path back to the White House even more narrow -- a fact that explains his need to rough up his opponent with the most toxic , polarizing campaign possible .\nJUST WATCHED Trump heads to NC rally where he 's expected to continue attacks on 'Squad ' Replay More Videos ...
