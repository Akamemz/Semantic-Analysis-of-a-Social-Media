They \u2019 re interviewing every eye witness they can find and matching evidence with existing law enforcement databases .\nBoth of the bombs were packed in heavy , dark bags , probably duffel bags or backpacks , said Mr. DesLauriers . He asked anyone who had seen a person struggling with such a load near the marathon 's finish line on April 15 , or anyone who had heard a friend , relative , neighbor , or coworker talk about targeting the iconic race in any way , to call the FBI .\n\u201c Someone knows who did this . Cooperation from the community will play a crucial role in this investigation , \u201d said DesLauriers .\nTwo blasts ripped through the Back Bay crowd seconds apart on Monday just before 3 p.m . Early indications are that the bombs had a basic explosive element , such as gunpowder or residue from match heads , placed inside common pressure cookers .
