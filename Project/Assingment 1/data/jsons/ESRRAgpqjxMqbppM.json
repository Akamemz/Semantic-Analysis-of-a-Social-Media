    "content": "In less than 24 hours , the Supreme Court confirmation process has been utterly transformed from a virtual certainty to a dramatic dilemma .\nWhen Brett Kavanaugh faced only an unnamed accuser with a vague story about something that allegedly happened nearly four decades ago , when he was at Georgetown Prep , it was clear that the Republicans had no intention of slowing down the train . And a rough media consensus , including some on the left , decided that this was a late hit and an unfair one at that .\nBut when Christine Blasey Ford came forward to The Washington Post , she changed the equation . And when her lawyer said on two morning shows yesterday that Ford is willing to testify , it created an unstoppable momentum that forced Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to invite her and Kavanaugh to testify next Monday . Once Jeff Flake and Susan Collins joined the call for hearings , there was no turning back . So much for Grassley 's initial suggestion that they just chat by phone .\nKavanaugh , too , with an expanded but equally vociferous denial , said he is willing to testify . So the initial proposal by Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley , that both be interviewed over the phone , looks dead in the water .\nEven President Trump , whose first instinct is always to counterattack , was restrained in comments about his nominee .\nWhile praising Kavanaugh , the president also said , `` I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner , because they had this information for many months . And they should n't have waited til literally the last days . They should have done it a lot sooner . But with all of that being said we want to go through the process . ''\nAnd he added : `` If it takes a little delay , it 'll take a little delay . ''\nEarlier , Kellyanne Conway said that `` this woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored . ''\nMuch of this is driven by math . With Jeff Flake , who is retiring , and Susan Collins saying there should be hearings , and the Republicans holding only a 51-49 majority , two defections could kill the nomination , even if the GOP bypasses the committee for a floor vote .\nLook , the process was terrible . Dianne Feinstein had been sitting on the anonymous letter since July . Even the liberal editorial page of the San Francisco Chronicle said Feinstein was `` unfair '' to everyone\u2014the nominee , the accuser and the panel \u2019 s members . The 11th-hour nature of the charge makes it look like desperation politics .\nIn the Post interview , Ford , now a research psychologist at Palo Alto University , expanded on her account , saying that Kavanaugh groped her as he tried to pull off her bathing suit and put his hand over her mouth when she screamed .\n`` I thought he might inadvertently kill me , '' Ford told the paper . `` He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing . ''\nAnd on `` Today , '' her lawyer Debra Katz said that Ford `` clearly considers this an attempted rape .
