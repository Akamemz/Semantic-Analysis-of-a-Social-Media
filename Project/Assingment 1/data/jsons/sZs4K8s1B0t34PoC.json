Sanders \u2019 summer was supposed to be all about building leverage for the Democratic convention , providing him with a better hand to play as he presses Clinton to accept his policy positions and party reform suggestions . Now , the people closest to him aren \u2019 t sure how exactly to get it back .\nHis first and most prominent endorsers have jumped off the bandwagon , congratulating and in some cases endorsing Clinton \u2014 from Sen. Jeff Merkley to Rep. Raul Grijalva , and from the Communications Workers of America to MoveOn.org.Each of the big-name Democrats and groups who steadfastly remained neutral in the primary have flocked to Clinton over the past week , from President Barack Obama to Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the AFL-CIO . Even Sanders ' highest-profile congressional endorsee , Nevada \u2019 s Lucy Flores , lost her primary bid on Tuesday despite his cash injection into her campaign .\nYet on Thursday night , speaking to over 200,000 viewers who tuned into his live-streamed video address , Sanders vowed to press on \u2014 pledging to fight to defeat Donald Trump but refusing to formally back Clinton and insisting his army of supporters isn \u2019 t going anywhere .\n\u201c We must continue our grassroots efforts to create the America that we know we can become , \u201d he said , nearly acknowledging defeat but making a point not to concede while reading from a prompter in a cramped television studio deep in his hometown . \u201c And we must take that energy into the Democratic National Convention on July 25 in Philadelphia where we will have more than 1,900 delegates .
