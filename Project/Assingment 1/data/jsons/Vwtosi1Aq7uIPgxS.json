Democrats fear the authorization may open the door to another long , bloody ground war in the Middle East , and Republicans say Mr. Obama is unnecessarily tying his own hands and taking a bizarre step by giving up some power in his role as commander in chief .\nAs he announced the plan in a White House speech Wednesday afternoon , Mr. Obama said the U.S. and its allies have made significant progress in halting the advance of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , through Iraq and Syria . Now , he wants the blessing of Congress to finish the job .\n\u201c Make no mistake \u2014 this is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time . It \u2019 s going to take time to dislodge these terrorists , especially from urban areas . But our coalition is on the offensive . ISIL is on the defensive , and ISIL is going to lose , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a brief address . \u201c Our coalition is strong , our cause is just and our mission will succeed . And long after the terrorists we face today are destroyed and forgotten , America will continue to stand free and tall and strong . \u201d\nThe authorization for use of military force , the first since the 2002 document authorizing the Iraq War , calls for the systematic destruction of the Islamic State and any person or group associated with it .\nThe authorization would last through 2018 , giving the U.S. and its allies three years to dismantle the radical terrorist organization , though the time frame could be extended .\nIt contains no geographic boundaries , allowing the president to dispatch U.S. planes or special forces to every corner of the globe to hunt down Islamic State fighters .\nThe authorization prohibits \u201c enduring offensive ground combat operations , \u201d but there is confusion about exactly what that term means . Mr. Obama stressed that he won \u2019 t commit the U.S. to another all-out ground war but made clear that he will use special operations forces to target Islamic State leaders when necessary .\n\u201c If we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders and our partners didn \u2019 t have the capacity to get them , I would be prepared to order our special forces to take action , \u201d he said .\nWhite House officials said ground forces could be used in defensive operations , for example if Islamic State fighters move on Baghdad .\nDemocrats are worried about the vague language and the prospect of escalation .\n\u201c This authorization needs to make it crystal-clear that U.S. combat troops can not be sent back into the Middle East as part of this conflict , and I worry that the vague limitations on ground troops in today \u2019 s draft may turn out to be no limitations at all , \u201d said Sen. Christopher Murphy , Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .\nOpening himself to such criticism wasn \u2019 t legally necessary , the president said .\nHe said the White House does not need a new authorization for use of military force to continue operations against the Islamic State because it has the necessary authority from 2002 on Iraq and a 2001 document allowing the U.S. to pursue those responsible for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .\nThe proposal he submitted Wednesday would repeal the 2002 authorization but would leave the 2001 authorization on the books . The administration , lawmakers and outside groups have said it is time to either repeal or rewrite the broad 2001 authorization , which Mr. Obama has used as legal justification for the air campaign against the Islamic State that began in August .\nIt is unclear how quickly the authorization will work its way through Congress and what it will look like when it leaves Capitol Hill .\nAfter months of calling for the White House to send over a plan , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will not take any action on the proposal until after a weeklong congressional vacation next week for President \u2019 s Day , said an aide to Sen. Bob Corker , Tennessee Republican and chairman of the committee .\n\u201c We will quickly begin to hold rigorous hearings where the administration will have an opportunity to provide Congress and the American people greater clarity on the U.S. strategy to address ISIS , particularly in Syria , \u201d Mr. Corker said in a statement .\nLeaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said they planned to hold a hearing Thursday to begin consideration of the strategy to combat the Islamic State , though no administration witnesses were expected .\nSen. Tim Kaine , Virginia Democrat , said he expects hearings to focus on the president \u2019 s strategy to defeat the Islamic State as much as the language of the authorization , including taking a look at the contributions to the fight from partners in the region .\nHe also expected lawmakers to try to clear up ambiguous language about ground troops .\nSpeaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said the president \u2019 s plan takes too many options off the table to give military leaders the resources they need to defeat the Islamic State .\n\u201c Any authorization for the use of military force must give our military commanders the flexibility and authorities they need to succeed and protect our people , \u201d he said in a statement . \u201c While I believe an AUMF against ISIL is important , I have concerns that the president \u2019 s request does not meet this standard . \u201d\nOther Republicans worry that the narrowness of the authorization would unnecessarily restrict presidential powers as commander in chief .\n\u201c He should explain why he is seeking to tie his own hands by limiting authority that he \u2019 s already claimed , \u201d said Rep.
