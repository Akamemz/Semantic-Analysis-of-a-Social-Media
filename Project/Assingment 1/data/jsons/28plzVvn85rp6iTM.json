MUST WATCH Tea Party reacts to shutdown 03:31\nPresident Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday , the start of the fiscal year , by lambasting the Republicans for being `` reckless '' in their apparent willingness to take down the government in order to take down the law overhauling major aspects of health care coverage . He championed the law , signed it in 2010 , then saw it upheld by the Supreme Court last year .\nSaying the shutdown 's goal is to hinder government efforts to provide health insurance to 15 % of the U.S. population that does n't have coverage , the president said it was `` strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda . ''\n`` Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act , '' he said , flanked by people who the White House said had benefited from the health care reform .\nReid , for one , indicated he 's open to working with the House on budgetary matters -- `` but not with the government closed '' and not by making it all about the legislation widely known as Obamacare .\nUntil then , he and other Democrats pushed for the House to pass a `` clean '' spending plan to fund the government for a few months before negotiating over parts of the health care law .\nThe latest shutdown was not the first for the government . The last time it happened , 18 years ago during the Clinton administration , the stalemate lasted 21 days .\nNow , the House and Senate have both refused to budge from their visions for the budget and , beyond that , health care reform .\nThe Senate began its day on Tuesday by rejecting a GOP counteroffer that would have delayed Obamacare for a year and ended federally provided health care for the president , members of Congress and their staffs while funding the government for 11 weeks .\nThe House GOP plan also called for a conference committee , which usually results from competing legislation from the two chambers on major issues , rather than a short-term continuing resolution intended to keep the government running for a few weeks .\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois , a leading liberal voice , told CNN that he is open to negotiations with the House on at least one specific provision of Obamacare -- a tax on medical devices that some in both parties oppose .\nHowever , Durbin echoed the position of Reid that such negotiations must be separated from the spending impasse that has shut down the government .\nOn the Republican side , Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN that he could vote to fund the government for a few days or weeks to provide time for a conference committee to work out a compromise .\nEven if there was somehow an agreement for a month , Congress would have another crisis on its hands : whether or not to raise the debt ceiling by October 17 , when the U.S. government is set to run out of money to pay creditors unless it increases how much it can borrow .\nWriting in USA Today , House Speaker John Boehner dug in his heels saying `` there is no way Congress can or should pass such a bill without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit . ''\nYet Obama offered no indication that he 'll budge . Noting that such Republican brinkmanship in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating , he said he `` will not negotiate over Congress ' responsibility to pay bills it 's already racked up . ''\n`` I 'm not going to allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud just to refight a settled election or extract ideological demands , '' the president said . `` Nobody gets to hurt our economy and millions of hard-working families over a law you do n't like . ''\nAt the heart of the issue is the insistence by House Republicans that any spending plan for the new fiscal year include anti-Obamacare amendments . Senate Democrats are just as insistent that it does n't .\nObamacare is n't directly tied to funding the government . But it 's so unpopular among the Republican tea party conservatives that they want it undercut , if not outright repealed . For instance , this week Republican Rep. Todd Rokita of Indiana called it `` one of the most insidious laws known to man . ''\nBoth Democrats and Republicans say that a clean spending measure -- with no Obamacare amendments , as urged by the president and his allies -- would pass the House with support from the Democratic minority and moderate Republicans .\nVeteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona noted that any attempt to repeal Obamacare was going to fail because of Obama 's veto , which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate to overcome . And GOP Rep. Peter King of New York said the problem is tea party conservatives tied to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who `` really care about nothing but their own agenda '' driving the Republican approach in the House .\n`` We have people in the conference , I believe , who 'd be just as happy to have the government shut down , '' said King , who has been among the Republican legislators pushing for a `` clean '' funding bill without anti-Obamacare provisions . `` They live in these narrow echo chambers . They listen to themselves and their tea party friends . That keeps them going , forgetting that the rest of the country thinks we 're crazy . ''\nHowever , Boehner has succumbed to pressure from the tea party right to avoid a vote that would pass something without causing some harm to the health care reforms .\nSpeaking in the early minutes of the shutdown , the Ohio Republican insisted the House voted `` to keep the government open '' and assure `` fairness for all Americans under Obamacare '' -- then walked away from the podium .\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN such intransigence is the root of the shutdown , noting that conservative Republicans such as Rokita are the only ones pushing a political agenda for meeting the congressional responsibility of passing a budget .\nAmid the finger-wagging and fulminating , major components of the new health insurance law went into effect on schedule on Tuesday .\n`` The Affordable Care Act is moving forward . You ca n't shut it down , '' said a post on Barack Obama 's verified Twitter feed .\nThe shutdown of the government -- the country 's largest employer -- is n't happening all at once .\nFederal employees who are considered essential will continue working . Those deemed non-essential -- up to 800,000 -- could be furloughed , unsure when they 'll be able to work or get paid again .\nThe shutdown could cost the still-struggling U.S. economy about $ 1 billion a week in pay lost by furloughed federal workers . And that 's only the tip of the iceberg .\nWhile many agencies have reserve funds and contingency plans that would give them some short-term leeway , the economic effect would snowball as the shutdown continued .\nThe total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers , said Brian Kessler , economist with Moody 's Analytics . His firm estimates that a three- to four-week shutdown would cost the economy about $ 55 billion .\nInitial market reaction around the world indicated little serious concern for now . In New York , all the major indexes were higher on Tuesday after closing lower the day before . World markets also rose , while the dollar slipped against other major currencies .\nAlthough much of the federal workforce will go without pay , checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of Congress . The president too will get paid . His salary -- $ 400,000 -- is considered mandatory spending .\nSome members of Congress and government officials have said they will donate their salary to charity during a shutdown .\nMembers of the military will also get paid -- thanks to Congress , which unanimously managed to come together to pass a bill that Obama signed .\nBut it 's uncertain how the shutdown will affect veterans , including the 3.3 million who are disabled . If the shutdown stretches into late October , the Veterans Affairs Department could have to halt disability and pension checks for elderly and ill veterans .\n`` That 's what they need to pay rent , to pay food , '' said Tom Tarantino of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America . `` It 's not their total income , but it is a significant part of it . ''\nAccording to a CNN/ORC poll , 68 % of Americans think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea , while 27 % think it 's a good idea .\nAnd it appears most Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a shutdown : Sixty-nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party 's elected officials were acting like `` spoiled children . ''\nDemocrats , however , were n't far behind : Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they , too , were acting like spoiled kids .\nAnother poll showed public support for Congress at record low levels -- at 10 % .\nKing , the New York Republican , said there 's plenty of blame to go around -- from Cruz , whom he called a `` fraud , '' and his tea party allies to the president for not being more engaged in resolving this crisis .\n`` Let him say he won the battle , '' King said of Obama . `` I do n't care who wins the battle . I want the government to reopen . ''",

During Congress' August recess, the tea party-backed freshman wrote to Republican leaders suggesting that they tie dismantling Obamacare to the funding bill. Though initially rejected by GOP leadership, 79 of Meadows' House colleagues signed on to the letter, which quoted James Madison writing in the Federalist Papers, \"the power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon ... for obtaining a redress of every grievance.\" --The architect.

He'll make the key play call. The top Republican leader in the land may be the most important player in the days immediately before a possible shutdown. Boehner could decide whether to push through the Senate's version of a spending bill and keep government running, or he could float a third version with some other Republican wish list items in it. If he takes the second option, Boehner could risk a shutdown but could also force the Senate into a tough position: give House Republicans something or send federal workers home. Timing on all this will be critical. Hide Caption 3 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- The revolutionary or rabble rouser, depending on your viewpoint. The tea party firebrand could lead a long filibuster on the Senate floor, delaying passage of a spending bill until just one day before the deadline on Monday, September 30. Cruz has stoked the anti-Obamacare flames all summer, but recently angered fellow Republicans by openly saying that the Senate does not have the votes to repeal the health care law. Hide Caption 4 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida -- Senator to watch. The potential presidential candidate has been one of three senators (Cruz and Mike Lee, R-Utah, being the others) pushing to use the government shutdown debate as a way to repeal or defund Obamacare. But watch his actions and language as a shutdown nears to see if he digs in or if downshifts at all. Hide Caption 5 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada -- The man steering the ship in the Senate. Master at using Senate procedure to his advantage, Reid is the main force in controlling the voting process in the chamber and ensuring that an attempted filibuster by tea party-types fails. The majority leader will be a primary negotiator if we reach phase three, if the House does not accept the Senate spending bill. Hide Caption 6 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky -- If Reid steers the ship, McConnell controls the headwinds. Which is good news for Reid, at least initially. The Republican leader and several of his members say they will vote against Cruz's filibuster and in favor of a spending bill with no limits on Obamacare. Meaning, in favor of a bill that just funds government. McConnell generally has been leery of running into a shutdown or default. In fact, one legislative method for avoiding default is named after him. Hide Caption 7 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington -- The consigliore. Murray, center, does not seek the outside limelight, but the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman is a major fiscal force behind the scenes on Capitol Hill. Known by fellow Democrats as a straight shooter, she is also an experienced negotiator, having co-chaired the laborious, somewhat torturous and unsuccessful Super Committee. Hide Caption 8 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia -- The new militia leader. The freshman congressman from Georgia, second from right, is one reason the debate has reached this point. Graves led the charge that blocked the original proposal by House Republican leaders. That would have kept government funded and had a detachable portion on Obamacare. Instead Graves and other conservatives forced their leaders to pass a spending bill with a mandatory defunding of Obamacare. Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Peter King, R-New York -- The blunt statesman. King is outspoken against many tea party tactics, calling the move to tie Obamacare to the must-pass spending bill essentially a suicide mission and Cruz \"a fraud.\" He is pushing for Republicans to accept a more \"clean\" spending bill that can pass the Senate and avoid a shutdown. Hide Caption 10 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Thomas Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- The heavy. Donohue is known for his deep connections and his aggressive lobbying on behalf of business. He and the Chamber are urging Republican lawmakers to avoid a shutdown. The Chamber is an important political backer for conservatives, but has had mixed success with the current Congress, locking in firm anti-tax positions but unable to push through immigration reform so far. Hide Caption 11 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action -- The driving force. Needham runs the political offshoot of the conservative Heritage Foundation and has been unrelenting in urging lawmakers to repeal Obamacare. He has told Republicans not to fear a potential shutdown, saying they would suffer more politically from allowing Obamacare to continue.

Expect the president to use his podium more as a shutdown nears, aiming at public opinion as Democrats in Congress position themselves. If House Republicans send back a new proposal close to the September 30 deadline, the president and Democrats will have to decide what move to make next. Hide Caption 13 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia -- The powerful lieutenant. Cantor, the House Republican No. 2, is much more closely allied with conservatives and tea party members in the House than is Speaker Boehner. The two have not always agreed on every strategy during potential shutdown debates, but have been in public lockstep during the current go-around. Hide Caption 14 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland -- Players on deck. The top two House Democrats are mostly watching and waiting. But they will play a critical role once Boehner decides his next move. They could either bring Democratic votes on board a deal or be the loudest voices against a new Republican alternative. Hoyer will be interesting to watch; he has strongly opposed both the House and Senate plans as cutting too much in spending. Hide Caption 15 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California -- The numbers guy. McCarthy, the House whip, has the tricky job of assessing exactly where Republican members stand and getting the 217 votes it takes to pass a bill in the chamber. He is known for his outreach to and connection with many of the freshmen House members who align with the tea party.

The vote of the House budget chairman and former vice presidential nominee is an important signal both within Republican ranks and to the public at large.

MUST WATCH Tea Party reacts to shutdown 03:31\n\nPresident Barack Obama weighed in Tuesday, the start of the fiscal year, by lambasting the Republicans for being \"reckless\" in their apparent willingness to take down the government in order to take down the law overhauling major aspects of health care coverage. He championed the law, signed it in 2010, then saw it upheld by the Supreme Court last year.\n\nSaying the shutdown's goal is to hinder government efforts to provide health insurance to 15% of the U.S. population that doesn't have coverage, the president said it was \"strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda.\"\n\n\"Republicans in the House of Representatives refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the Affordable Care Act,\" he said, flanked by people who the White House said had benefited from the health care reform.\n\nReid, for one, indicated he's open to working with the House on budgetary matters -- \"but not with the government closed\" and not by making it all about the legislation widely known as Obamacare.\n\nUntil then, he and other Democrats pushed for the House to pass a \"clean\" spending plan to fund the government for a few months before negotiating over parts of the health care law.\n\nFirst shutdown in nearly 18 years\n\nThe latest shutdown was not the first for the government. The last time it happened, 18 years ago during the Clinton administration, the stalemate lasted 21 days.\n\nNow, the House and Senate have both refused to budge from their visions for the budget and, beyond that, health care reform.\n\nThe Senate began its day on Tuesday by rejecting a GOP counteroffer that would have delayed Obamacare for a year and ended federally provided health care for the president, members of Congress and their staffs while funding the government for 11 weeks.\n\nThe House GOP plan also called for a conference committee, which usually results from competing legislation from the two chambers on major issues, rather than a short-term continuing resolution intended to keep the government running for a few weeks.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, a leading liberal voice, told CNN that he is open to negotiations with the House on at least one specific provision of Obamacare -- a tax on medical devices that some in both parties oppose.\n\nHowever, Durbin echoed the position of Reid that such negotiations must be separated from the spending impasse that has shut down the government.\n\nOn the Republican side, Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN that he could vote to fund the government for a few days or weeks to provide time for a conference committee to work out a compromise.\n\nEven if there was somehow an agreement for a month, Congress would have another crisis on its hands: whether or not to raise the debt ceiling by October 17, when the U.S. government is set to run out of money to pay creditors unless it increases how much it can borrow.\n\nWriting in USA Today, House Speaker John Boehner dug in his heels saying \"there is no way Congress can or should pass such a bill without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit.\"\n\nYet Obama offered no indication that he'll budge. Noting that such Republican brinkmanship in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, he said he \"will not negotiate over Congress' responsibility to pay bills it's already racked up.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to allow anybody to drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud just to refight a settled election or extract ideological demands,\" the president said. \"Nobody gets to hurt our economy and millions of hard-working families over a law you don't like.\"\n\n'The rest of the country thinks we're crazy'\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the insistence by House Republicans that any spending plan for the new fiscal year include anti-Obamacare amendments. Senate Democrats are just as insistent that it doesn't.\n\nObamacare isn't directly tied to funding the government. But it's so unpopular among the Republican tea party conservatives that they want it undercut, if not outright repealed. For instance, this week Republican Rep. Todd Rokita of Indiana called it \"one of the most insidious laws known to man.\"\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans say that a clean spending measure -- with no Obamacare amendments, as urged by the president and his allies -- would pass the House with support from the Democratic minority and moderate Republicans.\n\nVeteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona noted that any attempt to repeal Obamacare was going to fail because of Obama's veto, which would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate to overcome. And GOP Rep. Peter King of New York said the problem is tea party conservatives tied to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas who \"really care about nothing but their own agenda\" driving the Republican approach in the House.\n\n\"We have people in the conference, I believe, who'd be just as happy to have the government shut down,\" said King, who has been among the Republican legislators pushing for a \"clean\" funding bill without anti-Obamacare provisions. \"They live in these narrow echo chambers. They listen to themselves and their tea party friends. That keeps them going, forgetting that the rest of the country thinks we're crazy.\"\n\nHowever, Boehner has succumbed to pressure from the tea party right to avoid a vote that would pass something without causing some harm to the health care reforms.\n\nSpeaking in the early minutes of the shutdown, the Ohio Republican insisted the House voted \"to keep the government open\" and assure \"fairness for all Americans under Obamacare\" -- then walked away from the podium.\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN such intransigence is the root of the shutdown, noting that conservative Republicans such as Rokita are the only ones pushing a political agenda for meeting the congressional responsibility of passing a budget.\n\nAmid the finger-wagging and fulminating, major components of the new health insurance law went into effect on schedule on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act is moving forward. You can't shut it down,\" said a post on Barack Obama's verified Twitter feed.\n\nA blow to the economy\n\nThe shutdown of the government -- the country's largest employer -- isn't happening all at once.\n\nFederal employees who are considered essential will continue working. Those deemed non-essential -- up to 800,000 -- could be furloughed, unsure when they'll be able to work or get paid again.\n\nThe shutdown could cost the still-struggling U.S. economy about $1 billion a week in pay lost by furloughed federal workers. And that's only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhile many agencies have reserve funds and contingency plans that would give them some short-term leeway, the economic effect would snowball as the shutdown continued.\n\nThe total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers, said Brian Kessler, economist with Moody's Analytics. His firm estimates that a three- to four-week shutdown would cost the economy about $55 billion.\n\nInitial market reaction around the world indicated little serious concern for now. In New York, all the major indexes were higher on Tuesday after closing lower the day before. World markets also rose, while the dollar slipped against other major currencies.\n\nTroops, congressional paychecks safe\n\nAlthough much of the federal workforce will go without pay, checks will keep coming to the 533 current members of Congress. The president too will get paid. His salary -- $400,000 -- is considered mandatory spending.\n\nSome members of Congress and government officials have said they will donate their salary to charity during a shutdown.\n\nMembers of the military will also get paid -- thanks to Congress, which unanimously managed to come together to pass a bill that Obama signed.\n\nBut it's uncertain how the shutdown will affect veterans, including the 3.3 million who are disabled. If the shutdown stretches into late October, the Veterans Affairs Department could have to halt disability and pension checks for elderly and ill veterans.\n\n\"That's what they need to pay rent, to pay food,\" said Tom Tarantino of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \"It's not their total income, but it is a significant part of it.\"\n\nPublic reaction\n\nAccording to a CNN/ORC poll, 68% of Americans think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea, while 27% think it's a good idea.\n\nAnd it appears most Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a shutdown: Sixty-nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party's elected officials were acting like \"spoiled children.\"\n\nDemocrats, however, weren't far behind: Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they, too, were acting like spoiled kids.\n\nAnother poll showed public support for Congress at record low levels -- at 10%.\n\nKing, the New York Republican, said there's plenty of blame to go around -- from Cruz, whom he called a \"fraud,\" and his tea party allies to the president for not being more engaged in resolving this crisis.\n\n\"Let him say he won the battle,\" King said of Obama. \"I don't care who wins the battle. I want the government to reopen.\"",
