    "content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) is facing unprecedented pressure , as frustrated Democrats have begun \u2014 for the first time in seven years \u2014 to talk about replacing her after a series of disappointments at the ballot box .\nPelosi was hailed as a driving force behind Democrats \u2019 victory in 2006 , when the party seized both houses of Congress and set the stage for victory in the 2008 presidential election . She became the first female Speaker of the House , and set about centralizing power in the Speaker \u2019 s office , ruling her caucus with unquestioned authority and promoting an unapologetically liberal agenda .\nHowever , Pelosi \u2019 s role in the Obamacare debacle of 2009-10 helped provoke the Tea Party wave , sending her party to historic defeat and costing her the Speaker \u2019 s gavel . Amazingly , Pelosi did not resign at that point , and dispatched several would-be challengers , most notably Rep. Heath Shuler ( D-NC ) , who later lost his seat to a Republican . She also fended off a challenge by Rep. Tim Ryan ( D-OH ) after 2016 . Pelosi has been a prolific fundraiser for the party , even if she has also become a lightning rod for criticism and a useful political foil for Republicans to run against .\nIronically , Pelosi \u2019 s power within her caucus only grew as the Democrats lost seats , because most of the losses were in conservative swing districts . That left a core of liberal representatives from major cities , and blue states such as New York , Illinois , and Pelosi \u2019 s home state of California . There has been no political constituency in the caucus for an ideological alternative to the left-wing agenda that Pelosi and her coterie have continued to push even in defeat .\nThe high expectations that Pelosi set for Tuesday \u2019 s special election in Georgia may prove to be her undoing . Early in the week , with Jon Ossoff expected to win , Pelosi let it be known that she expected to take back the Speaker \u2019 s gavel after 2018 . But Republican Karen Handel surged to victory , partly by tying her opponent to Pelosi .\nAs reality hit home , some Democrats began to break the taboo around challenging their leader . MSNBC analyst Matthew A. Miller tweeted : \u201c No Dem wants to say it publicly , but taking their top bogeyman Pelosi off the table would help too . Fair or not , it \u2019 s the truth . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s time for some change . I think it \u2019 s time for a new generation of leadership , \u201d said Rep. Seth Moulton ( D-MA ) .
