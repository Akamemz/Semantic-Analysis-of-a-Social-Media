    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump attacked another prominent African American lawmaker on Saturday , tweeting that his Baltimore district is a `` disgusting , rat and rodent infested mess . ''\nTrump 's morning tirade against Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings , chairman of the House Oversight Committee , is the latest verbal assault against a minority member of Congress who is a frequent critic of the President . Two weekends ago , Trump -- in racist language that was later condemned by a House resolution -- told four progressive Democratic congresswomen of color to `` go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came . '' Three of the four were born in the US , and the fourth is a naturalized US citizen .\nTrump attacked Cummings , 68 , who is originally from Baltimore and represents Maryland 's 7th Congressional District , for erupting at acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan over border conditions during a congressional hearing on July 18 . Cummings ' committee has also launched a number of investigations into the Trump administration related to Trump 's finances and White House practices , including security clearances and Hatch Act violations\nThe President 's attacks , which went on to mention the Oversight investigation and another Democrat-represented district , continued into Sunday .\nThe President on Saturday suggested that conditions in Cummings ' district , which is majority black and includes parts of Baltimore , are `` FAR WORSE and more dangerous '' than those at the US-Mexico border .\n`` If he spent more time in Baltimore , maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place , '' Trump wrote , arguing that Cummings ' `` district is considered the Worst in the USA '' and `` no human being would want to live there . ''\nIn Cummings ' district , about 52 % of the population is black , while nearly 36 % is white , according to US census estimates\nThe President gave no indication of the basis of the claim but the tweets followed a segment that aired an hour earlier on Fox News , in which a Republican strategist said conditions in Cummings ' district were worse than those at the southern border .\n`` Mr. President , I go home to my district daily , '' Cummings wrote on Twitter Saturday in response . `` Each morning , I wake up , and I go and fight for my neighbors . It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch . But , it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents . ''\nCummings told ABC News recently that Trump 's `` go back '' remarks aimed at the four congresswomen brought back memories of the racism he faced as a boy growing up in Baltimore in the 1960s , echoing the same `` very painful '' racist insults he had heard during childhood .\nTrump has used similar language before to criticize Democratic Rep. John Lewis , a civil rights icon , and the Georgia district Lewis represents , which includes most of Atlanta .\nReaction to Trump 's tirade was swift with Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. Jack Young tweeting that it was `` completely unacceptable for the political leader of our country to denigrate a vibrant American City like Baltimore , and to viciously attack U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings a patriot and a hero .
