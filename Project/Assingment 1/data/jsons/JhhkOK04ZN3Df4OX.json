    "content": "Yesterday , NewsBusters reported that cable news has awarded Donald Trump and his surrogates significantly more airtime than the other Republican candidates . Today , we report how those same networks have divvied up the airtime between Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and challenger Bernie Sanders .\nFor this report , a team of MRC analysts has logged each prime time interview of a presidential candidate or a plainly-identified supporter or surrogate on CNN , MSNBC and the Fox News Channel over the past four weeks ( March 21 to April 15 , weekdays only ) , poring over approximately 240 hours of programming .\nAs we reported yesterday , the three main Republican candidates ( Trump , Texas Senator Ted Cruz , and Ohio Governor John Kasich ) and their surrogates were interviewed for a total of 666 minutes on the Fox News Channel during this period . Yet , neither former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton nor Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders gave any interviews to any of FNC \u2019 s prime time programs during the four weeks we examined , and their surrogates appeared for a total of only 13 minutes \u2014 a greater than 50-to-1 disparity .\nThese statistics , of course , only reflect airtime for presidential candidates and their surrogates , not overall coverage of the campaigns .\nWhat \u2019 s the reason ? Since 2007 , Democratic presidential candidates have generally boycotted Fox News , refusing to let the top-rated cable network host any of their presidential debates . Earlier this year , Fox News anchor Bret Baier pressed DNC chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz about \u201c letting the Fox News debate team handle \u201d one of the then-upcoming debates ; Schultz demurred .\nAt the same time , FNC \u2019 s core audience is decidedly right-of-center . A 2012 Pew Research Center survey of the Fox News audience found conservatives outnumbered liberals by a 6-to-1 margin ( 60 % to 10 % ) , while on shows such as Hannity the gap was a whopping 78 to 5 percent . So FNC may have concluded \u2014 not unreasonably \u2014 that its audience is more interested in hearing from the GOP candidates and their surrogates than the Democrats .\nOn CNN and MSNBC , the Democrats were much more visible \u2014 and , unlike the top two Republican candidates , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders \u2019 s campaigns received nearly equal airtime , with Sanders and his surrogates garnering 263 minutes of airtime , vs . Team Clinton \u2019 s 248 minutes .\nCNN gave the edge to Clinton , who personally appeared twice for a total of 28 minutes ; her surrogates boosted the campaign \u2019 s total to 110 minutes . Sanders also appeared twice , for a total of 40 minutes ; adding in his supporters puts his campaign \u2019 s total at 104 minutes , just behind the frontrunner .\nNot included in the interview tally : CNN \u2019 s Democratic debate between Clinton and Sanders , held on April 14 . If it had been , the two-hour event would have added 60 minutes to Clinton \u2019 s tally ( questions directed at her , plus her answers ) , and 52 minutes to Sanders .\nOn MSNBC , Sanders \u2019 s campaign took the most airtime , with nearly 159 total minutes ( 45 minutes for the candidate himself , the rest for surrogates ) . Clinton was interviewed only once , by Rachel Maddow on March 30 for a total of 33 minutes , with another 105 minutes going to staffers and other surrogates .\nMSNBC was the only network to give more airtime to the Democratic campaigns than the Republicans : Team Clinton and Team Sanders combined to receive 296 minutes of airtime , or nearly an hour more than the 246 minutes allocated to interviews with the Trump , Cruz and Kasich campaigns .\nOn CNN , the gap between the two parties \u2019 candidates was 515 minutes , more than eight-and-a-half hours , in favor of the Republican candidates .",
