    "content": "President Donald J. Trump made a speech to the United Nations , an organization he had recently dismissed as an impotent debating club , during which he mentioned North Korea , Iran , Syria , Israel , China , France , the United Kingdom , Cuba , Venezuela \u2014 even the USSR , which no longer exists . Two nations did not make the president \u2019 s roll call : Canada and Mexico .\nAmericans have an uncomplicated relationship with Canada . Mostly , we do not think about Canada at all . Sometimes , we joke about it , and sometimes we resent it on the theory that it has built its welfare state while freeloading under the U.S. military umbrella , a foolish if common complaint applied by Trump and other populists to Western Europe , too , as though we maintained all those troops in Germany to help out the Germans . Canada , on the other hand , has a complicated relationship with the United States , a country its people often resent for the same reason Philadelphia resents New York City .\nBut turning our eyes south for a moment ought to make us grateful for our neighbors to the north . We could hardly ask for better neighbors than the Canadians . Aside from some unpleasant business during and right after the Revolutionary War , the Canadians have been no trouble at all . American populists left and right get the vapors when they think about our \u201c addiction to foreign oil , \u201d as Barack Obama put it , but more of our U.S. energy imports come from Canada than from anywhere else \u2014 in fact , Canada provides more of our imported oil than all of the Persian Gulf producers combined . If you pay attention , you \u2019 ll notice that Washington \u2019 s batty talk about \u201c American energy independence \u201d has been replaced by talk of \u201c North American energy independence. \u201d That \u2019 s because we get so much of our energy from Canada and from our No . 3 supplier , Mexico . For similar reasons , we now label automobiles by what share of their components is of \u201c North American origin . \u201d\nThe Canadians buy about $ 320 billion worth of goods and services from U.S. producers each year and in 2016 sold Americans about $ 308 billion , resulting in a small trade surplus for the United States vis-\u00e0-vis Canada . There is a great deal of cross-border commerce , cultural and educational connections , immigration , and much more . And when the United States has been obliged to send its troops into war , the Canadians have been right beside us . That \u2019 s not to say that our relations have been entirely harmonious : Decrying the recent flood of illegal immigrants across his southern border , Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has done everything except promise to build a wall and make Donald Trump pay for it . Good neighbors make good fences .\nTrump \u2019 s speech to the United Nations touched on two interesting themes : One was his usual \u201c America First \u201d shtick , in this case bitching that the United States is obliged to bear a larger share of the United Nations \u2019 expenses than are those loafers in Eritrea and Guinea and mocking Kim Jong-un as \u201c Rocket Man. \u201d ( You can hardly blame him for that : Demeaning nicknames won him the Republican party \u2019 s presidential nomination . If it ain \u2019 t broke . . . ) The other was lavishing praise on the Marshall Plan \u2014 which , on the surface of it , was one of the least \u201c America First \u201d initiatives of the 20th century .\nThe Marshall Plan was a transnational do-gooder scheme cooked up by a bunch of Ivy League eggheads ( George F. Kennan practically defined \u201c establishment \u201d ) and longtime political insiders organized by the Brookings Institution . It was \u2014 angels and ministers of grace defend us ! \u2014 bipartisan , and it was damned expensive . It was opposed by the nationalist-populists of the time and championed by such gilded globalists as Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . It was also one of the great successes of American diplomacy .\nThe Marshall Plan succeeded because it conjoined the best of American idealism with a hardheaded assessment of American interests . The voters in Kansas were not out in the streets demanding aid for the reconstruction of Berlin , but the American leadership of the time understood that there is something more to leadership than getting out in front of a parade , and they knew that the speedy recovery of Western Europe \u2014 including that of the peoples who had just been making war on us \u2014 was necessary to counterbalance the rise of the red empire in the east .

And we \u2019 d be better off with a rich and stable Mexico to our south .\nThink of how much better-off we would be if we had a country more like Germany or France to our south \u2014 or a sunnier Canada \u2014 than the neighbor we \u2019 ve actually got .\nMexico is a poor country by North American standards , but a middle-income one by world standards .
