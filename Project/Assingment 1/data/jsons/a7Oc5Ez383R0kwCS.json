If that vote were combined rather than split , the socialist scenario says , it could result in a Democratic presidential nominee who is either openly socialist , like Senator Sanders , or an ideological ally of Sanders , like Senator Warren , who says she is a capitalist but who is campaigning with a call for an annual wealth tax and for what she calls `` big , structural change .

It 's not clear that the Democratic primary electorate has moved so far left since 2016 that re-running a similar experiment with Sanders in 2020 will produce appreciably different results than it did in 2016 .\nIt is hard to imagine Sanders endorsing Warren until and unless Warren defeats him consistently and by a significant margin in several early states . Similarly , it 's difficult to see what Warren would get from throwing her support to Sanders . Even if Warren were promised the vice presidency on a Sanders-Warren ticket , Democratic voters who are excited by her might be dismayed to see a woman of color\u2014if you credit Warren 's claim to Native American ancestry\u2014stepping aside to play a merely supporting role .
