    "content": "Forty-two years ago , I met a woman agent from Hollywood . She was a sweet , diminutive woman originally from Boston . She was a militant leftist , and teased me good naturedly but sometimes bitterly about my work for Nixon . We worked together for decades . She retired and moved to San Diego but I still talked to her on the phone a few times per week .\nShe was always solicitous about the health of my family members and I was about hers . Hundreds of times we talked of old times and of mental and physical illnesses around us . She did not like Trump . In fact , she was terrified of Trump , but I never could understand why . I told her over and over that I thought Trump had no chance of winning .\nThen , on election night , I told her I was wrong . Trump would surely win . Moreover , I told her , my wife and I had voted for Trump out of revulsion at the arrogance of Hillary Clinton .\nThat was election night . That was about two and a half months ago . That woman , who had been one of the mainstays of my life , who was probably as close to me as any woman in my world except my wife and my sister , has not spoken to me since .\nI have written to her asking her to speak to me . She answered with an angry letter rehearsing various grievances she had against me \u2014 that she had never mentioned until Trump won . I sent her two large plants . No answer . I sent her another letter asking her to speak to me . No response .\nHere \u2019 s the crazy part : when I tell this sad story to friends and colleagues , they all have similar stories to tell \u2014 about men and women \u2014 even brothers \u2014 who have refused to speak to the Trump voter .\nIt \u2019 s like the Civil War . Brother has been pitted against brother and children versus parents . I have not seen this level of bitterness before . Even in the Nixon days , I did not see such rage on the part of my leftist friends except from one nutcase ( naturally , a psychologist ) .\nWhy ? Why is Trump unleashing such rage ? Obviously , it \u2019 s not policy . No one gets to hate a friend over tariffs . No one stops speaking to a brother over immigration rules . No one gets a mad hate over corporate tax rates .\nNo , it has to be about personality . There is something in Trump that frightens the haters . Or else there is some weakness in Trump that excites bullies . A brilliant shrink once told me that the reason some hated RN was that he was a \u201c weak but dominant father figure. \u201d Children hate that . They would fear but love a strong figure ( like Stalin ) . But they would have anger and contempt for the dominant father figure whom they thought of as weak .\nTrump is not Nixon though . He \u2019 s a tough guy . He \u2019 s a shtarker , as we say in Yiddish . So , maybe some people hate a strong and dominant father figure . Maybe we don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going on .\nWe do know that the left has an astonishing capacity for hate . It organizes their thoughts , their poor jumbled up , nonsensical thoughts .\nThink of Orwell \u2019 s Two Minute Hates , in 1984 , which brought the people of Ingsoc together and helped them forget their misery . Think of Kristallnacht . Think of KKK lynchings . Think of the look of gleeful fury on the faces of women demanding that there be no interference with their \u201c right \u201d to murder their own children .\nNow , think : why does this hate and rage almost always come from the left ? Why are there no riots of white men demanding that hands be kept off their guns ? Why are there no mass marches of people who have worked and paid taxes all of their lives demanding an end to subsidizing the willful idleness of some groups ? Decent , life-loving men and women march for life . But they don \u2019 t riot for life .\nSo why does Trump , whose speeches are largely meaningless clich\u00e9s ( what does \u201c turning power back to the people today \u201d even mean ? ) , get people so frightened and so furious ? Almost everything big in life is about fear . But I just don \u2019 t get it . Jimmy Kimmel finds Trump mostly amusing \u2014 and so do I . What are others so afraid of ?\nBy the way , in seven days , he will have been in office nine days . Time for his Nobel Peace Prize . And what a genius Bob Dylan was to not show up for his .
