    "content": "How to Stay In is a series about redefining `` normal '' life in order to take care of ourselves and one another during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nA couple of Mondays ago , on a whim , I decided to take a vacation day . I had to bring my cat to the vet in the morning , which meant a 30-minute walk each way to the neighborhood bordering mine . All together I didn \u2019 t expect the excursion\u2014the walk , the appointment itself\u2014to take more than an hour and a half , but it was the excuse I needed to make myself take a day off .\nI knew I had nine days ' worth of vacation saved up , and I could recognize that I was burned out by work , but I couldn \u2019 t bring myself to face the prospect of more unstructured time . Though I still look forward to weekends under quarantine , they \u2019 ve taken on a different quality\u2014that is , the quality of there being nothing different about them . On Saturdays and Sundays I do the same activities I do on days I have work , except because I \u2019 m not working I can easily exhaust the possibilities for a day before 4 pm . But this wouldn \u2019 t happen on my vacation day , I thought , because it will be vacation .\nWhen I got home from the vet , I picked up one of the few books in my apartment I hadn \u2019 t read yet , and skimmed a few pages before realizing it was a terribly depressing book , about a girl whose dad locks her out of the house after she bikes 20 miles home from her French boarding school to visit . I abandoned the book and tried to take a nap , but I couldn \u2019 t fall asleep . I made a few moves in my Words with Friends games , scrolled through my phone for an hour , stared at the wall for another two , and then it was time for dinner . It felt like any other day .\nI had done something wrong , certainly , but was there anything I could do differently to have a more relaxing , more restorative quarantine vacation day ?\n\u201c It \u2019 s really important to set the stage and to prepare the environment , \u201d said Doreen Dodgen-Magee , an author and psychologist who studies the way technology shapes us . \u201c One thing I would seriously think about is how to delineate some time away from screens . \u201d\nDodgen-Magee said our constant screen time is part of the reason why those of us who are working from home might be more exhausted by our jobs lately , and wanting to take a day off in the first place . Whereas before , we at least had a commute separating the \u201c bad screen \u201d from the \u201c good screen , \u201d as a popular meme goes , now it \u2019 s all \u201c bad. \u201d The laptop we use to Zoom with our coworkers is the same one we use to Zoom with our friends , and marking the end of the workday might mean little more than closing one tab and opening another . This to say nothing of people who are working from home while caring for small children , for whom the already paper-thin boundary of \u201c work \u201d and \u201c life \u201d has been obliterated .\n\u201c When work creeps into what would normally be our time off , we can start feeling time-famished\u2014like we 're starving for time\u2014and that alone can make us feel less happy , \u201d Laurie Santos , a psychology professor at Yale University , told me . Her class , \u201c Psychology and the Good Life , \u201d is considered to be the most popular course in the history of the university .\n\u201c I think another issue is that we don \u2019 t often turn to the best leisure when we \u2019 re stressed , \u201d Santos continued . \u201c We often pick things that have an easy start-up cost ( e.g. , scrolling through social media , scanning Netflix ) rather than something a bit more challenging that gives us a sense of what scientists call \u2018 flow . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Flow \u201d describes a mental state in which you \u2019 re totally absorbed in what you \u2019 re doing . Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi , the Hungarian-American psychologist who coined the term in the 1990s , said that when a person achieves this state , \u201c the ego falls away . Time flies . Every action , movement , and thought follows inevitably from the previous one , like playing jazz. \u201d It \u2019 s a time when we \u201c feel our best and perform our best. \u201d Afterward , we feel refreshed and reinvigorated .\nDeciding to simply \u201c unplug , \u201d be it for an hour or a whole day , is only the first step to finding a flow state . To abstain from screens for any meaningful amount of time , we have to have something more exciting and absorbing in mind to take their place , Dodgen-Magee said . Before the coronavirus pandemic , that might have meant going to see a new museum show and taking yourself out for a nice meal during a staycation , or sunbathing and sightseeing while away on a trip . These activities may be off the table for now , but some basic principles apply , according to Dodgen-Magee : Vacation is about having sensory experiences we don \u2019 t usually have in our day-to-day lives , and if we engage our senses we can approximate the feeling of being on vacation , even under quarantine .\nDodgen-Magee said some new scents , scenes , and tastes are key : Light some candles , and put up something new on the wall , like a poster , or a roll of paper to draw or write on . Have some special groceries ready to go so you can enjoy a snack or dish you \u2019 ve never tried before , or order takeout from a new restaurant , or one you haven \u2019 t dined at since going into quarantine . If you \u2019 re someone who likes to pamper yourself , she suggested giving yourself a manicure or imitating a massage with a foam roller . If you usually use vacation for leisurely reading , set aside a would-be beach or plane read for your time off .\nVacation is about having sensory experiences we don \u2019 t usually have in our day-to-day lives , and if we engage our senses we can approximate the feeling of being on vacation , even under quarantine .\nSandi Mann , a psychology professor at the University of Lancashire who studies how the workplace affects our emotions , said a big part of enjoying vacation time under quarantine involves adjusting our expectations . We may not be able to get the same level of sensory experience we would from a typical vacation , but we can find a way to enjoy the forms of stimulation we have at our disposal .\n\u201c It \u2019 s about looking for the beauty in the mundane and finding the joy in everyday life without needing high levels of stimulation\u2014rediscovering the sunsets , leaves , the bird songs , and leaving our expectations behind , \u201d Mann said . She recommended looking at the weather forecast ahead of time and picking a day or two when it will be nice enough outside to take a walk along a different route , or to a neighborhood you don \u2019 t usually visit .\nSome people who , like me , have the immense privilege of still being able to take paid time off during the pandemic have done a better job at making the most of it .
