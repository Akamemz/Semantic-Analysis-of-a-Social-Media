Public records indicate that she is 29 years old . Officials confirmed the second patient lived alone on the 6000th block of Village Bin Drive and without pets .\n\u201c Like Nina Pham [ a nurse , and the first health care worker at the hospital to test positive for Ebola ] , this is a heroic person , a person who is dedicating her life to helping others and is a servant leader , \u201d said Jenkins .\nOfficials confirmed that within 90 minutes of reporting a fever , the health care worker \u2019 s temperature was taken and she was placed in isolation .\nPreliminary tests were run at the state public health lab in Austin and results came back at approximately midnight Wednesday . A separate test will be done this morning at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in Atlanta .\nOfficials have said the health care worker was interviewed quickly to identify any contacts or potential exposures , and that others will be monitored .

Pham \u2019 s dog has also been isolated .\nMore than 70 people who may have had contact with Duncan at the hospital are currently being monitored . The 48 contacts outside of the hospital who may have had contact with Duncan are asymptomatic , and Sunday marks the end of the 21-day incubation period , during which Ebola symptoms can arise after direct contact .\nOfficials have not said when or how the second health care worker or Pham may have had contact with Duncan .
