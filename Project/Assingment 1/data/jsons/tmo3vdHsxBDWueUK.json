These are only a few of the companies to ignite the collective ire of progressive consumers over corporate ties to Trump . In the case of the boutique fitness studios , it was a Trump fundraiser hosted by their majority stake investor Stephen M. Ross ; with the home improvement chain , it was co-founder Bernie Marcus \u2019 s promise to donate to Trump \u2019 s 2020 reelection campaign ; with the duck boot and outdoor apparel brand , it was Bean descendant and board member Linda Lorraine Bean \u2019 s $ 60,000 donation to Trump super PAC Making America Great Again , LLC ( itself a violation of the Federal Election Commission \u2019 s permitted donor limit of $ 5,000 ) .\nFor Americans opposed to Trump \u2019 s policies \u2014 from the inhumane treatment and targeting of detained migrants , to detrimental inaction on climate change , to refusal to regulate guns in the wake of unprecedented mass shootings \u2014 shopping at retailers connected to the celebrity-entrepreneur-turned-sitting-president is tantamount to hypocrisy .\n\u201c The goal came originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience \u201d\nCalls to boycott Trump-tainted brands stretch back to the # GrabYourWallet movement that began in the wake of the 2016 election . Organizers Shannon Coulter and Sue Atencio turned outrage into action with a spreadsheet of companies linked to Trump or the Trump family , both explicitly ( Trump owned ) and implicitly ( Trump funders , Trump brand sellers ) , detailing why those companies are on the list and what they need to do to get off it . \u201c The goal , \u201d Coulter told the New York Times , \u201c came originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience . \u201d\nOf course , boycott calls are not unique to Trump \u2019 s critics ; Trump himself is an avid boycotter , and his MAGA fans follow suit . Nor are boycott calls unique in the Trump era . Consumers have long registered their disapproval of businesses \u2019 practices by refusing to shop them and calling on others to do the same , dating back to this country \u2019 s birth ( and further back elsewhere in the world , like in ancient Greece and early Christianity , in the form of organized ostracism ) .\nWhat do you get when consumers takes action ? Consumer activism . And by the inverse action , consumers are shopping alternative products and companies that complement their worldview more now than ever before \u2014 particularly when it comes to combating climate change . Sustainability-tinged consumer activism is a new flavor of an old tactic , one that falls under the umbrella of what we now call conscious consumerism .\nConsumer activism can take the shape of two diametrically opposed actions \u2014 buying en masse and boycotting en masse \u2014 that are after the same goal\n\u201c [ Consumer activism is ] either grassroots collective organization of consumption or its withdrawal , \u201d explains Lawrence Glickman , an American historian at Cornell University and author of Buying Power : A History of Consumer Activism .\nMeaning , it \u2019 s \u201c Buy Nike ! \u201d to express support of Colin Kaepernick \u2019 s 2018 pick as brand ambassador following his kneeled protest against police brutality targeting people of color and his collusion lawsuit against the NFL . It \u2019 s also , \u201c Boycott Nike ! \u201d and even , \u201c # BurnYourNikes ! \u201d to express outrage over \u201c when somebody disrespects our flag , \u201d as Trump put it in 2017 , supposedly provoked by Kaepernick \u2019 s peaceful demonstration .\nCalls to boycott , though , are a heck of a lot more visible on social media than are rally cries to pledge brand support . Glickman writes in Buying Power that two-thirds of Americans take part in at least one boycott a year .\nBoycotts stem from anger . Anger spreads faster and farther on social media than any other emotion , as uncovered by computer scientists at China \u2019 s Beihang University and reported by MIT Technology Review . And there are many , many ongoing and overlapping boycotts at any given time . AP News even has a feed to track boycotts worldwide .\nConsumer activism , boycotts included , puts power in the hands of the people \u2014 \u201d or at least they think it is , \u201d adds Glickman .\nWe boycotted before there was even a word for it\n\u201c Boycotts are as American as apple pie , \u201d # GrabYourWallet co-founder and digital strategist Coulter told Fast Company in 2017 , referring to the Boston Tea Party \u2019 s 1773 dump of British imports that precipitated the American Revolutionary War . Colonists had boycotted British tea for several years by then ; \u201c No taxation without representation , \u201d they demanded . Refusing to purchase British tea was a pointed way to voice their mounting resentment of their decidedly un-independent status . Short of revolt , it was the only power they had \u2014 until , of course , they revolted .\nGlickman dates the boycott much further back : to ancient Greece . Expedition Magazine cites the city of Athens \u2019 historic boycott of the Olympic Games in 332 BCE as a key turning point . The city had incurred a massive fine after its endorsed athlete attempted , and failed , to fix a match , and refused to attend the games in protest unless the charges were dropped . ( They weren \u2019 t , and Athens eventually relented . )\nBoycotts are employed the world over , and not all of them are about consumerism\nThe term \u201c boycott \u201d didn \u2019 t emerge , however , until 1880 , in Ireland . Captain Charles Boycott was a British land agent in County Mayo \u2014 and \u201c the man who became a verb ! \u201d \u2014 whose evictions \u201c were many and bloody , \u201d as described by IrishCentral . After Boycott attempted to evict another 11 tenants , the Land League ( an Irish political organization of the 1800s that rallied in aid of poor farmworkers ) convinced Boycott \u2019 s employees to walk out and compelled the community to , essentially , ice him out . Shops and the like refused to do business with him , the post stopped his mail . He left Ireland humiliated .\nBoycotts are employed the world over , and not all of them are about consumerism . Just last month , tens of thousands of students in Hong Kong boycotted the first day of school as part of ongoing protests over an extradition bill that could send Hong Kong citizens to China , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a boycott of the Israeli TV channel that co-produced the HBO show Our Boys , and Sweden \u2019 s top female hockey players are boycotting the national team over unfair pay and poor working conditions .\nStill , there is a certain Americanness to the ubiquity of the boycott today . Take # GrabYourWallet , which at present calls for boycotts of 31 different companies ( not including subsidiaries or partners ) , five over their Stephen M. Ross connections . Says Glickman , Americans \u201c didn \u2019 t invent [ the boycott ] , but the frequency with which we use it is somewhat exceptional . \u201d\nConsumer activism in 2019 is not a whole lot different from consumer activism in the 1840s \u2014 except when it comes to the causes\n\u201c A lot of people think that what we \u2019 re seeing now is new , \u201d says Glickman . \u201c But there are a lot of parallels with history. \u201d Particularly , America \u2019 s history of slavery and abolitionism .\nThe Free Produce Movement , led by Quaker abolitionists in the 1840s through the Civil War , hinged on boycotting goods made by enslaved people , cotton key among them . Buying these products , as far as Free Produce stalwarts were concerned , was analogous to supporting slavery outright .\nThe issues are different today , but the strategy remains the same : Vote with your dollar and don \u2019 t contribute a cent to the bottom line of companies whose values don \u2019 t align with your own . Says Glickman , \u201c That fundamental question of , \u2018 No one stands outside of moral problems , that we \u2019 re all implicated in [ them ] \u2019 \u2014 that \u2019 s the essence of consumer activism . \u201d\n\u201c \u2018 No one stands outside of moral problems , that we \u2019 re all implicated in [ them ] \u2019 \u2014 that \u2019 s the essence of consumer activism \u201d\nVoting with your dollar doesn \u2019 t just mean not spending your dollars in problematic places ( i.e . Amazon , Wayfair , etc . ) ; it also means supporting companies that practice what they preach , both by way of their company culture and by what they sell . Conscious consumerism drives at that very point , particularly when it comes to \u201c voting \u201d for sustainability and humane working conditions .\nSays the Nation \u2019 s Willy Blackmore of the boycott \u2019 s antebellum lineage , where abolitionists bought wool over cotton and maple sugar over cane :\nThe same thinking\u2014that it \u2019 s better to buy products that we believe are made without exceptional suffering\u2014animates some contemporary conscious consumerism . The desire to minimize the harm we cause as consumers has led to a variety of fluffy marketing terms as well as third-party verification organizations , so you can buy everything from cruelty-free makeup to Fair Trade food products .\nConscious consumerism ( alternatively called ethical consumption ) is today \u2019 s catchall to cover consumer dollars invested in a host of progressive values : worker rights , animal rights , low-carbon footprint , recycled and/or renewable materials , organic , local , etc . \u2014 your fair-trade fashion , your greenhouse-gas-cutting Ikea , your metal straw . It \u2019 s a term that \u2019 s caught on in the last 10 years , but it was not only predated by the green consumerism of the 1990s , it \u2019 s also the driving argument behind all consumer activism from the tea-in-the-harbor get-go .\nWhat is newish , however , is the phenomenon of sustainable shopping and widespread availability of ethically made , eco-friendly goods \u2014 where consumers concerned about climate change , for instance , \u201c live their values \u201d vis a vis their plastic-free purchases .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to pinpoint exactly when we saw consumers trying to make positive environmental change in their shopping , \u201d says Emily Huddart Kennedy , University of British Columbia sociologist and author of Putting Sustainability into Practice : Applications and Advances in Research on Sustainable Consumption . Data analytics company Nielsen called 2018 \u201c The Year of the Influential Sustainable Consumer , \u201d adding that \u201c it \u2019 s soon to be the decade of the sustainable shopper. \u201d Sustainable product sales reached $ 128.5 billion in 2018 , up 20 percent from four years prior ; Nielsen projects 2021 to cash in on $ 150 billion worth of sustainability sales .\nThere are several theories , says Kennedy , on what caused the shift , including mistrust in government to adequately address climate change and the growing \u201c sense of doing something in the face of these huge sustainability crises , \u201d as she puts it . Kennedy \u2019 s research has shown that conscious consumerism \u2019 s popularity can also be tied to its elite nature \u2014 in part because of high price tags , in part because of championing among celebrities , in part because of its en vogueiness , \u201c it \u2019 s seen as a \u2018 high-class \u2019 thing to do . \u201d\nConsuming consciously is aspirational , both for individuals and for the planet . University of Toronto sociologist Jos\u00e9e Johnston , a colleague of Kennedy \u2019 s , found that nearly two-thirds of consumers resonated with the statement , \u201c shopping is a powerful force for social and environmental change. \u201d Elaborates Johnston \u2019 s survey report in the Journal of Marketing Management , \u201c This suggests that the majority of the shopping public believe that their shopping dollars can promote a social and environmental alternative to the status quo . \u201d\nConsumer activism , for all its prevalence , might be an unintentional misdirect , say critics\nActivists for any one particular cause are in no way united that consumer activism is the most effective way \u2014 or even an effective way \u2014 to enact change . The main criticism is that individual product swaps do nothing to impact legislation and corporate responsibility .\nThat \u2019 s not a new argument ; many abolitionists disagreed with their Free Produce Movement cohorts . As Glickman writes in Buying Power , \u201c Critics accused free produce activists of overvaluing private rectitude to the point where it had little connection with the public good. \u201d Maybe wearing wool and eating maple makes you abolitionists feel better , Free Produce critics seemed to say , but it does squat to end slavery .\n\u201c Conscious consumerism is a lie , \u201d writes sustainable fashion expert and frequent \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor Alden Wicker for Quartz , quoting a speech she delivered at the 2017 UN Youth Delegation . \u201c Small steps taken by thoughtful consumers \u2014 to recycle , to eat locally , to buy a blouse made of organic cotton instead of polyester \u2014 will not change the world. \u201d Instead , she argues , conscious consumerism is an expensive distraction from the real work at hand .\nSure , vote with your dollar , the criticism stands \u2014 but you do a whole lot more by simply voting for politicians who give a damn that the Earth is melting . Only 46.1 percent of voters aged 18-29 voted at all in 2016 , 55 percent of which voted Democrat . Nielsen found that 90 percent of millennials ( aged 21-34 ) are willing to pay more for eco-friendly and sustainable products . These stats don \u2019 t necessarily provide a one-for-one since there \u2019 s a gap in the age categorizations , but if the entirety of that 90 percent of conscious consumer millennials had gone to the polls and voted how their dollar votes ... We don \u2019 t have to spell it out , right ?\nWith more opportunities to be a conscious consumer \u2014 thanks to more and more \u201c leading brands that compete to see who is greener , \u201d as Joel Makower , author of 1990 \u2019 s The Green Consumer , writes for GreenBiz \u2014 so too do opportunities for economic existential angst mount . Ditching plastic straws , in the grand scheme of things , will do diddly for the planet , representing less than 1 percent of our sweeping plastic problem .\nAnd as such , conscious consumerism can deliver unearned complacency , house-on-fire calm akin to \u201c This Is Fine \u201d dog . As Jim Leape , co-director of the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions told Stanford Report , \u201c The risk is that banning straws may confer \u2018 moral license \u2019 \u2014 allowing companies and their customers to feel they have done their part . The crucial challenge is to ensure that these bans are just a first step . \u201d\nSen. Elizabeth Warren homed in on this very point during CNN \u2019 s recent climate change forum , following a series of questions to Democratic candidates on regulating lightbulbs , banning plastic straws , and encouraging people to cut down on red meat , as reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Li Zhou :\n\u201c Oh , come on , give me a break , \u201d Warren said in response to the lightbulb question , in one of the breakout moments of the night . \u201c This is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about . ... They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs , around your straws , and around your cheeseburgers , when 70 percent of the pollution , of the carbon that we \u2019 re throwing into the air , comes from three industries . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s an added tension when it comes to green shopping and movements like Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement , that conscious consumerism \u2019 s prescribed solution is antithetical to sustainability \u2019 s aims .\n\u201c The idea of \u2018 shopping \u2019 your way to sustainability is fundamentally flawed , \u201d says sociologist Kennedy . \u201c That is , if we need to slow down growth to protect the environment , then we can \u2019 t rely on \u2018 better \u2019 consumption \u2014 we also have to reduce consumption. \u201d To her point , climate activist Greta Thunberg \u2019 s speech at the UN \u2019 s Climate Action Summit on September 23 addressed world leaders but zeroed in on an oft-repeated delusion that cutting emissions by 50 percent in 10 years will do the trick . \u201c We are in the beginning of a mass extinction , and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth . How dare you . \u201d\nThere are alternative ways that consumers can \u201c do something \u201d impactful with their money , writes Wicker in Quartz : Donating to activist organizations and donating to politicians who vow to vote for green initiatives ( i.e . passing a Green New Deal ) and holding big corporate offenders accountable are good places to start .\nIn a word : sometimes ! In more words , whether or not consumer activism and conscious consumerism \u201c work \u201d depends , really , on the definition of success .\nHistorian Glickman likes to differentiate between short-term and long-term goals . Sociologist Kennedy separates material benefits from ideological gains .\n\u201c Oftentimes the boycott starts with a great deal of enthusiasm and ends with a whimper \u201d\n\u201c Almost every boycott fails to achieve its punitive goal , \u201d says Glickman . The Montgomery Bus Boycott , he adds , is a rare example of an \u201c unambiguous victory , \u201d where the boycott attained its demands : hiring black drivers , promising respectful drivers , and first-come first-seated policy . The SoulCycle boycott is another : Last month \u2019 s consumer activism over Ross \u2019 s Trump fundraiser did in fact dent SoulCycle \u2019 s attendance . But these are notable exceptions ( the former inarguably more impactful than the latter ) to the rule .\nAdds Glickman , \u201c A lot of times boycotts of big corporations don \u2019 t really affect the bottom line of that corporation . Oftentimes the boycott starts with a great deal of enthusiasm and ends with a whimper. \u201d For instance , Amazon : Despite calls year after year to boycott Amazon Prime Day over factory conditions ( and this year over contracts with ICE ) , the retail behemoth repeatedly manages to smash its sales record .\nIn terms of the material benefit of product swaps , \u201c the jury is out , \u201d says Kennedy . Yes , phosphate-free dish detergent can curb water pollution , she says ; but Kennedy \u2019 s research shows that conscious consumers often maintain very large carbon footprints themselves . \u201c Conscious consumers tend to be well-educated , \u201d explains Kennedy , \u201c and well-educated people typically earn a good income , \u201d income that buys them nice cars and tickets on commercial planes and air conditioning units and so on .\n\u201c The ideological benefits are not much more conclusive , unfortunately , \u201d adds Kennedy . \u201c I think it \u2019 s fair to say that conscious consumption has made more people think about the resources that go into the stuff we buy and about what happens to our stuff when we throw it away. \u201d This , in effect , is consumer activism \u2019 s long-term goal , what historian Glickman calls \u201c a transformation of consciousness. \u201d On the other hand , Kennedy says , \u201c When people obsess about the environmental impact of their goods , that can let companies and governments off the hook . So it \u2019 s a mixed bag . \u201d\nWhere and how we spend our money does matter . But how much it matters depends on what else we do with our money and what governments and corporations do with their ( considerably larger ) pots . At best , the rising popularity of conscious consumerism , for instance , suggests that the buying public will at least spend their way to a healthier world ; the big problem , though , is that individual monetary action \u2014 even when performed collectively \u2014 is only the beginning .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t imagine that the world is worse off because of conscious consumerism , \u201d says Kennedy , \u201c but I doubt it will be enough to save the planet . \u201d",

It\u2019s a term that\u2019s caught on in the last 10 years, but it was not only predated by the green consumerism of the 1990s, it\u2019s also the driving argument behind all consumer activism from the tea-in-the-harbor get-go.\n\nWhat is newish, however, is the phenomenon of sustainable shopping and widespread availability of ethically made, eco-friendly goods \u2014 where consumers concerned about climate change, for instance, \u201clive their values\u201d vis a vis their plastic-free purchases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when we saw consumers trying to make positive environmental change in their shopping,\u201d says Emily Huddart Kennedy, University of British Columbia sociologist and author of Putting Sustainability into Practice: Applications and Advances in Research on Sustainable Consumption. Data analytics company Nielsen called 2018 \u201cThe Year of the Influential Sustainable Consumer,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s soon to be the decade of the sustainable shopper.\u201d Sustainable product sales reached $128.5 billion in 2018, up 20 percent from four years prior; Nielsen projects 2021 to cash in on $150 billion worth of sustainability sales.\n\nThere are several theories, says Kennedy, on what caused the shift, including mistrust in government to adequately address climate change and the growing \u201csense of doing something in the face of these huge sustainability crises,\u201d as she puts it. Kennedy\u2019s research has shown that conscious consumerism\u2019s popularity can also be tied to its elite nature \u2014 in part because of high price tags, in part because of championing among celebrities, in part because of its en vogueiness, \u201cit\u2019s seen as a \u2018high-class\u2019 thing to do.\u201d\n\nConsuming consciously is aspirational, both for individuals and for the planet. University of Toronto sociologist Jos\u00e9e Johnston, a colleague of Kennedy\u2019s, found that nearly two-thirds of consumers resonated with the statement, \u201cshopping is a powerful force for social and environmental change.\u201d Elaborates Johnston\u2019s survey report in the Journal of Marketing Management, \u201cThis suggests that the majority of the shopping public believe that their shopping dollars can promote a social and environmental alternative to the status quo.\u201d\n\nConsumer activism, for all its prevalence, might be an unintentional misdirect, say critics\n\nActivists for any one particular cause are in no way united that consumer activism is the most effective way \u2014 or even an effective way \u2014 to enact change. The main criticism is that individual product swaps do nothing to impact legislation and corporate responsibility.\n\nThat\u2019s not a new argument; many abolitionists disagreed with their Free Produce Movement cohorts. As Glickman writes in Buying Power, \u201cCritics accused free produce activists of overvaluing private rectitude to the point where it had little connection with the public good.\u201d Maybe wearing wool and eating maple makes you abolitionists feel better, Free Produce critics seemed to say, but it does squat to end slavery.\n\nTwenty-first century shoppers face, in spirit, the same conundrum.\n\n\u201cConscious consumerism is a lie,\u201d writes sustainable fashion expert and frequent Vox contributor Alden Wicker for Quartz, quoting a speech she delivered at the 2017 UN Youth Delegation. \u201cSmall steps taken by thoughtful consumers \u2014 to recycle, to eat locally, to buy a blouse made of organic cotton instead of polyester \u2014 will not change the world.\u201d Instead, she argues, conscious consumerism is an expensive distraction from the real work at hand.\n\nSure, vote with your dollar, the criticism stands \u2014 but you do a whole lot more by simply voting for politicians who give a damn that the Earth is melting. Only 46.1 percent of voters aged 18-29 voted at all in 2016, 55 percent of which voted Democrat. Nielsen found that 90 percent of millennials (aged 21-34) are willing to pay more for eco-friendly and sustainable products. These stats don\u2019t necessarily provide a one-for-one since there\u2019s a gap in the age categorizations, but if the entirety of that 90 percent of conscious consumer millennials had gone to the polls and voted how their dollar votes ... We don\u2019t have to spell it out, right?\n\nWith more opportunities to be a conscious consumer \u2014 thanks to more and more \u201cleading brands that compete to see who is greener,\u201d as Joel Makower, author of 1990\u2019s The Green Consumer, writes for GreenBiz \u2014 so too do opportunities for economic existential angst mount. Ditching plastic straws, in the grand scheme of things, will do diddly for the planet, representing less than 1 percent of our sweeping plastic problem.\n\nAnd as such, conscious consumerism can deliver unearned complacency, house-on-fire calm akin to \u201cThis Is Fine\u201d dog. As Jim Leape, co-director of the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions told Stanford Report, \u201cThe risk is that banning straws may confer \u2018moral license\u2019 \u2014 allowing companies and their customers to feel they have done their part. The crucial challenge is to ensure that these bans are just a first step.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren homed in on this very point during CNN\u2019s recent climate change forum, following a series of questions to Democratic candidates on regulating lightbulbs, banning plastic straws, and encouraging people to cut down on red meat, as reported by Vox\u2019s Li Zhou:\n\n\u201cOh, come on, give me a break,\u201d Warren said in response to the lightbulb question, in one of the breakout moments of the night. \u201cThis is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about. ... They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers, when 70 percent of the pollution, of the carbon that we\u2019re throwing into the air, comes from three industries.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an added tension when it comes to green shopping and movements like Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement, that conscious consumerism\u2019s prescribed solution is antithetical to sustainability\u2019s aims.\n\n\u201cThe idea of \u2018shopping\u2019 your way to sustainability is fundamentally flawed,\u201d says sociologist Kennedy. \u201cThat is, if we need to slow down growth to protect the environment, then we can\u2019t rely on \u2018better\u2019 consumption \u2014 we also have to reduce consumption.\u201d To her point, climate activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s speech at the UN\u2019s Climate Action Summit on September 23 addressed world leaders but zeroed in on an oft-repeated delusion that cutting emissions by 50 percent in 10 years will do the trick. \u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\u201d\n\nThere are alternative ways that consumers can \u201cdo something\u201d impactful with their money, writes Wicker in Quartz: Donating to activist organizations and donating to politicians who vow to vote for green initiatives (i.e. passing a Green New Deal) and holding big corporate offenders accountable are good places to start.\n\nOkay, okay, but does consumer activism do \u2026 anything?\n\nIn a word: sometimes! In more words, whether or not consumer activism and conscious consumerism \u201cwork\u201d depends, really, on the definition of success.\n\nHistorian Glickman likes to differentiate between short-term and long-term goals. Sociologist Kennedy separates material benefits from ideological gains.\n\n\u201cOftentimes the boycott starts with a great deal of enthusiasm and ends with a whimper\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost every boycott fails to achieve its punitive goal,\u201d says Glickman. The Montgomery Bus Boycott, he adds, is a rare example of an \u201cunambiguous victory,\u201d where the boycott attained its demands: hiring black drivers, promising respectful drivers, and first-come first-seated policy. The SoulCycle boycott is another: Last month\u2019s consumer activism over Ross\u2019s Trump fundraiser did in fact dent SoulCycle\u2019s attendance. But these are notable exceptions (the former inarguably more impactful than the latter) to the rule.\n\nAdds Glickman, \u201cA lot of times boycotts of big corporations don\u2019t really affect the bottom line of that corporation. Oftentimes the boycott starts with a great deal of enthusiasm and ends with a whimper.\u201d For instance, Amazon: Despite calls year after year to boycott Amazon Prime Day over factory conditions (and this year over contracts with ICE), the retail behemoth repeatedly manages to smash its sales record.\n\nIn terms of the material benefit of product swaps, \u201cthe jury is out,\u201d says Kennedy. Yes, phosphate-free dish detergent can curb water pollution, she says; but Kennedy\u2019s research shows that conscious consumers often maintain very large carbon footprints themselves. \u201cConscious consumers tend to be well-educated,\u201d explains Kennedy, \u201cand well-educated people typically earn a good income,\u201d income that buys them nice cars and tickets on commercial planes and air conditioning units and so on.\n\n\u201cThe ideological benefits are not much more conclusive, unfortunately,\u201d adds Kennedy. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that conscious consumption has made more people think about the resources that go into the stuff we buy and about what happens to our stuff when we throw it away.\u201d This, in effect, is consumer activism\u2019s long-term goal, what historian Glickman calls \u201ca transformation of consciousness.\u201d On the other hand, Kennedy says, \u201cWhen people obsess about the environmental impact of their goods, that can let companies and governments off the hook. So it\u2019s a mixed bag.\u201d\n\nWhere and how we spend our money does matter. But how much it matters depends on what else we do with our money and what governments and corporations do with their (considerably larger) pots. At best, the rising popularity of conscious consumerism, for instance, suggests that the buying public will at least spend their way to a healthier world; the big problem, though, is that individual monetary action \u2014 even when performed collectively \u2014 is only the beginning.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that the world is worse off because of conscious consumerism,\u201d says Kennedy, \u201cbut I doubt it will be enough to save the planet.\u201d\n\nSign up for The Goods\u2019 newsletter.
