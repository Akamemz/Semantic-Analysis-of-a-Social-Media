    "content": "The Pentagon is no longer immune from budgetary cuts . House GOP thinks unthinkable on DOD cuts\nThe Republican mantra for decades has been : cut NPR , EPA and the National Endowment for the Arts .\nIn the modern history of the Republican Party , it would have been unthinkable . The GOP is built on two core tenets \u2014 small government and big defense spending \u2014 and for decades , the two ideas co-existed peacefully . Republicans wanted to cut the federal budget \u2014 everywhere except the Pentagon . No more .\nThe reason : A new breed of conservatives in the House cares so much about cutting spending they \u2019 re willing to extend that to the budget for bullets and bombs , too \u2014 in this case , by letting $ 500 billion in across-the-board automatic budget cuts over 10 years take effect , alongside a similar number for domestic agencies .\n\u201c I \u2019 m reading what a lot of different members are saying , and I find there \u2019 s not as much opposition to sequestration as I thought there might be , \u201d Rep. Bill Young ( R-Fla. ) , the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee in charge of the Pentagon \u2019 s purse strings , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think I have any real feeling for which direction this House is going , and this is the first time in a long time that I haven \u2019 t had a pretty good feel for it , \u201d Young added .\nIt \u2019 s got defense hawks in the House on edge \u2014 and on the defensive . But the members of the next generation say their argument is straightforward : Of course they want a strong national defense , but spending is spending .\n\u201c What you \u2019 re hearing from some folks about the status of the sequester simply tells you that there \u2019 s a group of Republicans who are willing to look at the Defense Department equally with the other departments , \u201d said Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( R-S.C. ) , a sophomore who has been leading the campaign for spending cuts , including at the Pentagon .\n\u201c I think Republicans lose credibility when they say we have to look everywhere for savings except defense , \u201d he added .\nRepublican Policy Committee Chairman James Lankford of Oklahoma said sequester isn \u2019 t his first choice . He \u2019 d rather shift cuts to domestic programs , but he knows that \u2019 s an idea Senate Democrats aren \u2019 t going to swallow .\n\u201c I haven \u2019 t done the head count , but I can tell you a large part is committed to saying we have to reduce spending . We \u2019 d rather do it another way . But if the only way it can be done is sequestration , then it has to be done , \u201d said Lankford , a sophomore who quickly rose to the top ranks of Republican leadership .\nRight now , bets are on the automatic cuts taking place . It would take a dramatic , last-minute action from the White House to prevent them .\nAnd sequestration saber rattling is loud enough that the defense industry is taking notice . Pentagon brass , who had long insisted they weren \u2019 t planning for sequestration , outlined several short-term personnel measures in case Congress doesn \u2019 t turn off the automatic cuts by the March 1 deadline , including hiring freezes , voluntary early retirements and furloughs of up to 30 days .\nThe reasons for the GOP \u2019 s political shift are many : America is the world \u2019 s lone superpower , with its military might unchallenged . The nation \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 are weary of war , as President Barack Obama wound down the involvement in Iraq and is winding down the one in Afghanistan .\nBut first and foremost , some of these newly elected conservatives had the backing of the tea party \u2014 whose central tenet is cutting what it sees as runaway federal spending , wherever it is , and stopping an explosion of dangerous deficits and debt .\nAnd that \u2019 s showing up on the House floor : House GOP floor votes in recent weeks suggest Speaker John Boehner won \u2019 t be catching many breaks as he works with an unruly conference in search of big cuts on the big-ticket fiscal questions of the day , including sequestration , increasing the nation \u2019 s $ 16.4 trillion borrowing limit and the expiration of the continuing resolution at the end of March .\nFor example , 157 Republicans voted for Mulvaney \u2019 s amendment to the Hurricane Sandy relief bill that would have slashed all government spending , including the Pentagon \u2019 s , as a budget offset . ( The amendment failed thanks to opposition from Democrats and 71 Republicans . )\nThe first House roll call of the 113th Congress \u2014 to provide $ 9.7 billion in flood insurance for Sandy victims \u2014 garnered 67 \u201c no \u201d votes . Nearly half came from freshman and sophomore Republicans .\nEven defense hawks aren \u2019 t immune to registering their objections over how GOP leaders have handled the budget and tax negotiations with the Obama White House . The last-minute fiscal cliff deal that passed last month \u2014 extending George W. Bush-era tax cuts and postponing sequestration until March \u2014 won the support of just 10 of the 35 Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee .\nAmong House GOP lawmakers known as Pentagon stalwarts , several said they were alarmed by floor vote defections and the rhetoric from fellow Republicans . They recognize they \u2019 re the ones playing defense now on the military budget .\n\u201c There are people that think we need to cut more , \u201d House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon ( R-Calif. ) acknowledged in an interview .\nMcKeon said he \u2019 s been pushing back against budget hawks in the GOP conference by pointing to the nearly $ 600 billion in spending cuts that the Pentagon has already absorbed in recent years \u2014 and that \u2019 s before sequestration would even begin .\nEven if budget hawks were to get their way , McKeon added , the sequestration cuts slated to hit the Pentagon and the rest of the federal budget in March \u2014 stretched out over a decade \u2014 won \u2019 t make a dent against the deficit .\n\u201c At a time when China is increasing their defense spending and we \u2019 re having all these hot spots and troubles around the world , I \u2019 m thinking that really people don \u2019 t all see the whole big picture and don \u2019 t understand that if you totally eliminated the Defense Department , totally eliminated federal spending on education , on transportation , on parks , on everything that we vote on , if you eliminate all discretionary budgets , we \u2019 d still be running a deficit of a half-trillion dollars a year , \u201d he said .\nBut that money does make a difference for the Defense Department and its ever-changing mission , including new threats in Africa . McKeon said he \u2019 s telling Republicans that lives are at stake if the sequestration spending cuts go forward .\n\u201c The military is going to be asked to do more with less . Every time we do that , every time we cut the military back in our history going into World War II , and to Korea and to Vietnam , we lost people because we had cut back too much , and I don \u2019 t want to see that happen , \u201d he said .\nNot all House GOP freshmen say they would support voting to let the automatic Pentagon cuts as currently constituted go forward .\n\u201c Overall , we have to save money in the budget , but sequestration is not the way to do it , \u201d said Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine , a Navy pilot and Armed Services Committee member who joined eight other Republicans last month voting against Boehner \u2019 s election as speaker . \u201c Sequestration needs to be undone . And I \u2019 m looking forward to working on this committee to make sure that it gets undone . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 d rather we manage it in more of an intelligent fashion than just say we \u2019 re cutting it , \u201d added Rep.

There \u2019 s just areas that , yeah , we can pull back a little more , even though they did their $ 470 billion already . They said it hurt , but we possibly could . \u201d\nAsked where he envisioned military cuts , Yoho replied \u201c some of the bases may need to be relooked at . \u201d\nObama initially signed off on sequestration figuring the Pentagon cuts would be so painful that they \u2019 d force Republicans to the bargaining table to negate them .
