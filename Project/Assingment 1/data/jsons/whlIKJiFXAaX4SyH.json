    "content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has many tools to prevent the discharge petition from reaching the House floor \u2014 and even to prevent a clear majority of legislators from passing the planned amnesty .\nTwenty GOP legislators have signed the petition , just five short of the number need to let the Democrats get 218 votes for a floor vote on an amnesty bill . When , or if , 25 GOP members have signed , Democrats can rush another 193 signatures on the petition , giving them then 218 votes they need to force a vote on the floor , which can happen the following month .\nVoters can make their opinions clear , and the President can threaten a veto , but House Speaker Ryan has the institutional and political power to make or break the amnesty petition \u2014 and to avoid turning the floor over to Rep. Nancy Pelosi in the run-up to the November election .\nRyan can demote , defund and defenestrate GOP legislators who sign the petition .\n\u201c What can be doing is beating the crap out of these moderates just like they would be beating the crap out of conservatives if they were trying to do this , \u201d said Rachel Bovard , policy director at Conservative Partnership Institute .\nRyan can exclude members from joint fundraisers , deny them any share of collective funds and kick them out of the committee slots which make members attractive to donors . He can ask donors to stop donating , and he can ask allies to stop allying , and he can threaten to freeze out retiring members if they start lobbying for favors .\nIn 2015 , 34 House members voted against the House Speaker John Boehner \u2019 s leadership on a trade issue .\nBoehner retaliated and Rep.
