(Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters)\n\nIts importance to the U.S. and the world goes far beyond oil.\n\nIt is an unpopular view in Washington now to say that the Middle East matters. But it does. War fatigue, American energy \u201cdominance,\u201d and a bipartisan campaign to increase burden-sharing, in which Arab state partners pay more and do more for their own regional security, are strong and widely supported arguments for America\u2019s disengagement with the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe collateral damage of a persistent incompetence on the part of Saudi Arabia to manage its communications strategy and intelligence operations has made the U.S.\u2013Saudi strategic partnership weaker than it was after September 11, 2001.
