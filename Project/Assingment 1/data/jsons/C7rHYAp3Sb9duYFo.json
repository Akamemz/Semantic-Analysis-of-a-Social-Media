At the same time , Mr. Sedney said , al Qaeda \u201c appears to be reclaiming lost ground , with its activities once again increasing in the region and its ability to exercise leadership control from Pakistan seeming to be on an upswing . \u201d\nAccording to other sources , a portion of the debate gripping White House intelligence and national security advisers centers on whether a serious and sustainable drone campaign over the Afghan-Pakistani border region could be ramped up again as needed .\nGeneral Atomics \u2019 Grey Eagle drone , which the Army \u2019 s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment has deployed to Afghanistan , can fly for more than 25 hours at a time at altitudes up to 29,000 feet and carry four Hellfire missiles . Such characteristics conceivably would allow for widespread drone missions inside Afghanistan , as well as cross-border missions into Pakistan , to be carried out from Bagram Air Field .\nThe catch , according to one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the classified nature of the drone program , is that the Grey Eagle \u2019 s accuracy and efficiency depend on ground intelligence gathered by soldiers at forward operating bases in the region .\n\u201c Technically , you can probably continue to do drone operations from Bagram , but the important question is : Where are you going to get targetable intel from ? \u201d said the source . \u201c How are you going to know what to hit and know that it \u2019 s going to be there when your drones get there ? Are you going to just have Afghans call in the targets ? That \u2019 s not how we usually operate . \u201d\n\u201c The Army used to have a saying that \u2018 every soldier is a sensor , \u2019 \u201d added the U.S. official , who spoke with The Times on Thursday . \u201c Well , we \u2019 re going to have a lot fewer soldiers on the ground , and that means a lot fewer sensors . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s worse , Mr. Sedney said , is that once the U.S. loses the capability provided by forward operating bases in Afghanistan , that capability will be difficult to restore . \u201c Theoretically , you could ramp it back up , but practically it \u2019 s very hard because it involves re-establishing support structures , including gaining the trust of locals to let you back in .\n\u201c Politically , there will also be a great cost for it , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s one thing to continue an activity . It \u2019 s another thing to renew it . \u201d\nMr. Obama said Tuesday that the current U.S. force of nearly 35,000 troops in Afghanistan will be cut to roughly 9,800 by the end of this year .\n\u201c By the end of 2015 , we will have reduced that presence by roughly half and will have consolidated our troops in Kabul and on Bagram Air Field , \u201d the president said . By the end of 2016 , he said , the U.S. military will \u201c draw down to a normal embassy presence \u201d in the Afghan capital .\nMr. Obama offered few details about how U.S. troops will operate beyond saying that \u201c we \u2019 re open to cooperating with Afghans on two narrow missions after 2014 : training Afghan forces and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda . \u201d\nThe Pentagon offered similarly guarded responses this week when pressed for details about the future of U.S. drones , Special Forces and counterterrorism operations that have included incursions into Pakistan from forward operating bases in Afghanistan .\n\u201c I won \u2019 t detail the specifics in terms of exactly how counterterrorism operations are going to work going forward , \u201d Rear Adm. John Kirby , the Pentagon \u2019 s top press secretary , told CNN on Tuesday . \u201c We know it \u2019 s a persistent challenge , and nobody is going to turn their back on that . \u201d\nDespite such assurances , many counterterrorism analysts are skeptical . \u201c The reality is that the fewer troops we have in Afghanistan , the fewer bases we have there and [ the ] less ability we have to conduct airstrikes , be it droned or manned aircraft , \u201d said Bill Roggio , editor of The Long War Journal and a scholar focused on al Qaeda at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies .\nMr. Roggio , who spoke with The Times before Mr. Obama \u2019 s announcement this week , said 5,000 to 10,000 troops on the ground is \u201c just not enough coverage to conduct air operations and counterterror operations in Afghanistan , let alone Pakistan . \u201d\n\u201c When you get down to 6,000 , you \u2019 re getting down to the proverbial self-licking ice cream cone , \u201d said Frederick W. Kagan , who heads the American Enterprise Institute \u2019 s Critical Threats Project in Washington .\n\u201c What you have is one base that can defend itself and probably not even make sure that Kabul doesn \u2019 t fall to the Taliban , \u201d said Mr. Kagan , who also spoke with The Times before Mr. Obama \u2019 s announcement .\nWhat \u2019 s particularly disconcerting , Mr. Sedney said , is the manner in which al Qaeda appears to be recovering from gains made by the 2005-to-2013 drone campaign and the 2011 raid that killed bin Laden .\n\u201c These strikes were just having a dampening effect . They were not permanently degrading or defeating al Qaeda , \u201d Mr. Sedney said . \u201c Al Qaeda is an ideology , not a core of individuals . The number of attacks is ramping up again . The flow of recruits never stopped ; the flow of money has not stopped . A lot of the flow has gone to Syria , but much of that is because al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan wanted it there . \u201d",
