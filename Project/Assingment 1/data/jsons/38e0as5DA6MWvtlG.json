With House members dispersed around the country , Pelosi and Republican leaders were planning to bless the measure by a voice vote , probably with just a sprinkling of lawmakers present in the chamber .\n\u201c It will pass with strong bipartisan support , \u201d said Pelosi , D-Calif. President Donald Trump has implored lawmakers to finish with the package so he can sign it into law .\nThe package comes to the House as fresh evidence emerges that the economy is in a recession . The government reported 3.3 million new weekly unemployment claims , four times the previous record . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a TV interview the economy \u201c may well be in a recession . \u201d\nPelosi praised the bill \u2019 s expansion of unemployment benefits and provisions that encourage companies hit by the pandemic to keep paying their workers , even those who are furloughed .\n\u201c We will have a victory tomorrow for America \u2019 s workers , \u201d she said . \u201c If somebody has a different point of view , they can put it in the record , but we \u2019 re not worried about that . \u201d\nThe package would give direct payments to most Americans , expand unemployment benefits and provide a $ 367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home . It would steer substantial aid to larger industries , too .\nThe unanimous Senate vote late Wednesday came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough and capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has faced .\nThe 880-page measure is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote \u2014 and he released senators from Washington until April 20 , though he promised to recall them if needed .\n\u201c Pray for one another , for all of our families and for our country , \u201d said McConnell , R-Ky .\n\u201c The legislation now before us now is historic because it is meant to match a historic crisis , \u201d said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. \u201c Our health care system is not prepared to care for the sick . Our workers are without work . Our businesses can not do business . Our factories lie idle . The gears of the American economy have ground to a halt . \u201d\nThe package is intended as relief for a sinking economy and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that \u2019 s killed more than 21,000 people worldwide . The U.S. death toll has surpassed 1,000 people .\n\u201c This is a unique situation , \u201d Powell told NBC \u2019 s \u201c Today \u201d show . \u201c This is not a typical downturn . \u201d\nThe Fed chief went on : \u201c What \u2019 s happening here is people are being asked to close their businesses , to stay home from work and to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity and so they \u2019 re pulling back . And at a certain point , we will get the spread of the virus under control and at that time confidence will return , businesses will open again , people will come back to work . \u201d\nUnderscoring the effort \u2019 s sheer magnitude , the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $ 4 trillion-plus annual federal budget . The $ 2.2 trillion estimate is the White House \u2019 s best guess .\nThe drive by leaders to speed the bill through the Senate on Wednesday slowed as four conservative Republican senators from states whose economies are dominated by low-wage jobs demanded changes . They said the legislation as written was so generous that workers like store clerks might opt to stay on unemployment rather than return to their jobs . They settled for a failed vote to modify the provision .\nWednesday \u2019 s delays followed Democratic stalling tactics earlier in the week as Schumer held out for additional money for states and hospitals and other provisions .\nThe sprawling measure is the third coronavirus response bill produced by Congress and by far the largest . It builds on efforts focused on vaccines and emergency response , sick and family medical leave for workers and food aid .\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , said earlier he expected the measure to pass by a voice vote without lawmakers having to return to Washington . House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday his members were on board with that .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll have a debate , and then we \u2019 ll have a voice vote to bring it up and move it to the president \u2019 s desk , \u201d McCarthy told Fox News . He said that while Democrats inserted things in the bill that didn \u2019 t deal with coronavirus , \u201d we will still get this package done for hospitals , workers , small businesses . \u201d\n\u201c Every day matters , so we want to get this done quickly , \u201d McCarthy said .\nThe package has a heavily negotiated $ 500 billion program for guaranteed , subsidized loans to larger industries , including airlines . Hospitals would get significant help as well .\nThe bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $ 1,200 per adult making up to $ 75,000 a year and $ 2,400 to a married couple making up to $ 150,000 , with $ 500 payments per child .\nA huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks to an estimated $ 130 billion . Another $ 45 billion would fund additional relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for local response efforts and community services .\nDemocrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months , rather than the three months first proposed . Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment , plus a $ 600-per-week add-on , with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time .\nBusinesses controlled by members of Congress and top administration officials , including Trump and his immediate family members , would be ineligible for the bill \u2019 s business assistance .\nState and local authorities would receive up to $ 150 billion in grants to fight the virus , care for their residents and provide basic services .\nRepublicans won inclusion of an employee retention tax credit that \u2019 s estimated to provide $ 50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 % of workers \u2019 paycheck up to $ 10,000 . Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 % Social Security payroll tax .\nPelosi was a force behind $ 400 million in grants to states to expand voting by mail and other steps that Democrats billed as making voting safer but Republican critics called political opportunism . The package also contains $ 15.5 billion more for a surge in demand for food stamps as part of a massive $ 330 billion title for agency operations .\nMost people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks . For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , or death .\nIn the United States , more than 69,000 people have been sickened by the virus .",
