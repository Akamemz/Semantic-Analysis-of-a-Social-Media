Yet others , deeply distressed by the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and eager for the Republican Party to rally around a mainstream candidate with viability , say they have come to terms with Bush \u2019 s long odds and the possibility they will eventually get behind someone else .\n\u201c I acknowledge reality . There \u2019 s going to be three or four candidates remaining after New Hampshire , \u201d said former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber , a Jeb Bush adviser who also worked on George W. Bush \u2019 s presidential campaigns . \u201c I think the field is going to narrow pretty quickly . We \u2019 ll see what happens in South Carolina , and from there you can see the dynamic starting to winnow the field pretty quickly . \u201d\nWhile Weber said he would remain with Bush as long as he was in the race , others said they may soon head for the exits . Barring a strong showing , they said , Wednesday could be a day of deep reflection for them .\n\u201c If he doesn \u2019 t do well in New Hampshire , I think he needs to think long and hard about what he wants to do , \u201d said one top Bush fundraiser who played a key role in his brother \u2019 s administration .\nAnother high profile Bush financial backer , who has also been close to the family for years , said most of Bush \u2019 s donors would give him until the South Carolina primary on Feb. 20 . \u201c That \u2019 s when they say , \u2018 Enough . \u2019 \u201d\nThere is still some reason for optimism . If recent polls are to be believed , Bush has climbed to within striking distance of second place , putting him in a head-to-head competition with his chief rival , Rubio . And he might have more upside after Saturday night , when Bush emerged relatively unscathed from the GOP debate while Rubio stumbled badly under a barrage of attacks , largely from Chris Christie .\nYet Bush \u2019 s top aides are still struggling to keep restless supporters in line . On Thursday , three days after the former governor barely registered in the Iowa caucuses , the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise held a conference call with top donors to outline the path forward . At one point , Mike Murphy , a longtime top Bush adviser who oversees Right to Rise , was pressed by a donor on why the super PAC \u2019 s substantial spending had yet to improve the former governor \u2019 s poll numbers .\nFor Bush \u2019 s supporters , though , the question of whether to desert him is a complicated one . Bush \u2019 s network of loyal donors and political supporters is far more extensive than that of any of his rivals . The ties between them and the Bush family \u2013 to which many of them remain deeply indebted \u2013 are strong and long-lasting . This weekend , dozens of longtime Bush family friends and supporters from across the country descended on New Hampshire to trudge through the snow and knock on doors .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no question that some of us have had long relationships with the family , from Prescott Bush to George W. Bush . Most of the folks I know who were with us in 1988 , 1992 , 2000 , and 2004 and here with us now , \u201d said Lawrence Bathgate , the Republican National Committee finance chairman under President George H.W . Bush , pointing to the family \u2019 s long list of presidential campaigns . \u201c I have no intention of leaving the team at all and I think most people feel the same way . \u201d\nIf some backers do begin to walk away , it could alter the trajectory of the campaign . The former governor , who has raised well over $ 120 million , has a deep well of donors who could go on to fill another contender \u2019 s coffers .\nTo date , Bush has lost relatively few high profile contributors . One exception came in November when Brian Ballard , a top Florida-based fundraiser , announced he was ditching the campaign out of disagreements over strategy .\nSome say they are hesitant to leave Bush because there is a growing sense that he has no intention of departing the race soon . He has said publicly to supporters , and privately to senior aides , that he will fight on to South Carolina and his team has begun planning a campaign event there with George W. Bush . His campaign is getting ready to send a bus of Bush loyalists from Washington , D.C. to South Carolina .\nTo many of Bush \u2019 s closest followers , the thought of him dropping out is almost unthinkable \u2013 particularly if Rubio emerges as the leading establishment candidate . Among Bush \u2019 s top advisers , the dislike of Rubio -- who for years was a junior figure to Bush in Florida politics and is seen as deeply disloyal -- is intense . One top Bush fundraiser said that on conference calls with the campaign Rubio has been called \u201c Judas , \u201d a reference to the biblical figure who had betrayed Jesus .\nBut with the governor struggling , some - for all their feelings of closeness to the family \u2013 hint that they are beginning to think about the possibility of a 2016 campaign without him .\n\u201c One thing I am is a loyal guy and I \u2019 m loyal to the Bush family . It \u2019 s been a wild ride , \u201d said Francis Rooney , who served as an ambassador under George W.
