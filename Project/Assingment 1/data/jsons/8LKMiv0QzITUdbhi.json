    "content": "John Dowd , one of the lead lawyers who represented President Trump during Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation into Russian collusion , said Tuesday that the special counsel engineered a perjury trap for Trump in the exact same way that James Comey \u2019 s FBI invented a trap for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn .\n\u201c Mueller \u2019 s scheme was the same one captured in the ( newly released ) FBI set-up notes pertaining to Flynn . They knew they had nothing , but using their official power they created and perpetuated the facade of an investigation , \u201d said Dowd .\nIn an extensive interview on Tuesday , Dowd explained to me how his commitment of cooperation and transparency in dealing with Mueller was eventually turned against the president , as the special counsel \u201c misled \u201d Trump \u2019 s legal team in order to manufacture a crime where none existed .\nJENNA ELLIS : MICHAEL FLYNN 'S JUDGE \u2013 3 POSSIBLE REASONS HE HIRED A DEFENSE ATTORNEY\nAccording to Dowd , Mueller learned early in his investigation that there was no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion to influence the 2016 presidential election . He admitted it during a meeting with the president \u2019 s lawyers on March 5 , 2018 . So , Mueller shifted to a legally contorted interpretation of obstruction of justice in order to keep his investigation afloat .\nOn Tuesday , Dowd elaborated on how the special counsel deceived the Trump team :\n\u201c As I look back , we had the most perfect trusting relationship with Mueller based on his word and handshake , which held throughout . No paper . Word was solid . They received everything they asked for without a hitch or page missing , including the most intimate notes of conversations with and by POTUS ( President of the United States ) . Every witness they requested testified truthfully . No lying . No grand jury testimony . Mueller affirmed all of this in our March 5 ( 2018 ) meeting . How could there be a whisper of obstruction under these circumstances ? \u201d\nDespite no evidence of an underlying crime , Mueller insisted that the president be interviewed by the special counsel . Dowd knew it was a trap . Mueller had done it to Flynn and others . He was clearly angling for obstruction of justice and hoping to ensnare the president in the equivalent of a perjury trap if he consented to be interviewed .\nBut obstructing what ? Mueller readily acknowledged that there was no underlying crime . Moreover , Trump had encouraged every witness connected to his campaign and the White House to testify . He voluntarily produced more than a million pages of documents . The special counsel \u2019 s investigation had proceeded unimpeded .\nAs Mueller persisted , Trump \u2019 s lawyer realized that he had been conned all along . On Tuesday , Dowd was unsparing in his scorn for Mueller and his unscrupulous tactics :\n\u201c That is when I knew he had lied to me in our original meeting ( June 16 , 2017 ) and every meeting thereafter . Robert Mueller \u2014 \u2018 D.C. \u2019 s great man \u2019 \u2014 completely and deliberately misled us in order to set up a perjury/false statement trap for POTUS . It was a monstrous lie and scheme to defraud . \u201d\nDowd shared with me numerous documents and letters supporting his accusations against Mueller . They paint a vivid picture of a special counsel determined to damage the president with an investigation bereft of any credible evidence .\n\u201c They acted like crybabies who were offended that someone dared to criticize them , so they instinctively labeled it obstruction , \u201d Dowd told me last year .\nIn the March 5 , 2018 , meeting , the special counsel suggested that maybe Trump \u2019 s firing of Comey ( Mueller \u2019 s longtime friend , partner and ally ) might constitute obstruction of justice . This was especially ludicrous since both Comey and deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe had testified that no one had obstructed the bureau \u2019 s investigation and that the probe had continued uninterrupted after Comey \u2019 s departure .\nDowd patiently explained to Mueller that the firing had been an exercise of presidential authority under the Constitution and could not , by definition , establish obstruction . Even Comey had confirmed this . Trump had sacked the director for repeated violations of FBI regulations in his mishandling the Hillary Clinton email scandal and on the recommendation of the deputy attorney general , as well as several former attorneys general and deputy attorneys general from different eras and both political parties .\nYet , Mueller would not relent . This led to an angry confrontation between the special counsel and Dowd that is recounted in my book , `` Witch Hunt : The Story Of The Greatest Mass Delusion In American Political History '' ( page 222 , Chapter 5 ) :\nDowd : You want to look at obstruction in the firing of Comey ? I \u2019 ll tell you who our first witnesses will be : the attorney general , the deputy attorney general and the White House counsel . They all urged the president to fire Comey . He was off the rails in his handling of the Clinton email case .\nMueller : We may pursue a grand jury subpoena to compel the president to testify .\nDowd ( pounds his fist on the table ) : You \u2019 ve got nothing ! Go ahead ! I can \u2019 t wait for you to try . You \u2019 ve got no leg to stand on .\nJay Sekulow , another of President Trump \u2019 s lawyers , attended that meeting and confirmed to me this account of the heated exchange , which was also reflected in his handwritten notes .\nAt the same meeting , Mueller became so desperate that he broached the absurd idea of how Trump \u2019 s public criticism of the special counsel might be construed somehow as an obstructive act . Dowd felt that Mueller and his subordinates were now living in an alternative universe where their version of the law bore no resemblance to statutes , Supreme Court decisions and accepted constitutional law .\n\u201c They acted like crybabies who were offended that someone dared to criticize them , so they instinctively labeled it obstruction , \u201d Dowd told me last year . He added , \u201c It was insane . \u201d\nOne of the most insightful documents Dowd shared with me recently was a letter to Mueller dated Feb. 16 , 2018 , in which Trump \u2019 s legal team argued persuasively how the FBI \u2019 s counterintelligence investigation was predicated on Russian disinformation secretly fed to ex-British spy Christopher Steele , who composed a phony anti-Trump \u201c dossier \u201d that was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democrats .\nJust last month , more than two years after Dowd \u2019 s letter , declassified documents were released proving that Kremlin-sponsored disinformation drove the collusion case . Comey and his confederates deliberately exploited what they knew to be untrue and discredited information . They used it as a pretext to spy on the Trump campaign and investigate the president . This led to the illegitimate appointment of the special counsel , Bob Mueller , who launched an investigation in search of a crime that never occurred . As Dowd correctly stated in his letter , the special counsel appointment was \u201c void \u201d because it was the product of corruption .\nOn Tuesday , Dowd called Mueller \u2019 s investigation and report a sham . \u201c They knew there was nothing there. \u201d Dowd said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also knew it and is \u201c just as guilty . \u201d\nDowd said he hopes that U.S. Attorney John Durham , who is currently investigating the Russia hoax , would hold all of them to account for their rampant corruption and dishonesty . \u201c Their three-year investigation was all phony , \u201d he observed .\n\u201c They knew there was nothing to investigate .
