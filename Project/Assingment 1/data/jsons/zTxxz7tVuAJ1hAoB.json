But the order caused confusion at the nation \u2019 s airports , including for green-card holders and dual citizens .\n\u2022 Trump said that the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , which unanimously decided not to reinstate Trump \u2019 s travel ban , has had its rulings overturned by the Supreme Court \u201c at a record number. \u201d Not true .\n\u2022 Trump wrongly said that Hillary Clinton \u201c gave \u201d Russia 20 % of the uranium in the United States . Clinton was one of nine votes approving the deal . She alone couldn \u2019 t have stopped the deal , which involved 20 % of U.S. production capacity , not stocks , and the uranium can \u2019 t go to Russia without export licenses .\n\u2022 The president claimed his November victory was \u201c the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. \u201d It wasn \u2019 t . Three presidents since Reagan captured a larger share of electoral votes than Trump did , including Republican George H.W . Bush .\n\u2022 Trump said \u201c jobs have already started to surge \u201d since his election , citing investments by Ford , Fiat Chrysler and Intel . But the investments , much of which were in the works before the election , were largely market driven .\n\u2022 Contrary to the president \u2019 s claim that \u201c nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates , \u201d there was plenty of press coverage in October when it was revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared several questions with the Clinton campaign during the primary election .\n\u2022 Trump said he thought the media had \u201c a lower approval rate than Congress. \u201d No \u2014 the public \u2019 s approval of Congress is lower than its trust in the media .\nTrump took questions from the media after announcing his new pick for labor secretary , R. Alexander Acosta , dean of the Florida International University College of Law and a former U.S. attorney .\nTrump described his administration as \u201c a fine-tuned machine , \u201d and in particular praised its implementation of his anti-terrorism executive order , which has been largely blocked by the courts .\nOf course , that is his opinion . But there are some facts that suggest it was less than perfect .\nThe order included a 90-day travel ban on citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries . It was signed on Jan. 27 , and caused confusion and sparked protests at international airports .\nFor example , the order did not say \u2014 and the administration failed to immediately clarify \u2014 whether lawful permanent residents of the U.S. , known as green-card holders , would be barred from reentering the U.S. , if they are citizens of the seven banned countries .\nOn Jan. 28 , CNN reported that green-card holders from the affected seven countries would need a waiver to enter the country , citing unnamed administration sources . A day later , Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement confirming that green-card holders would be allowed into the U.S. on a case-by-case basis . Three days later , the administration issued an update on Feb. 1 declaring green-card holders would not need a waiver .\n\u201c They no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident they won \u2019 t need it anymore , \u201d White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a Feb. 1 briefing .\nIt also was unclear how the order affected dual citizens . For example , that caused confusion for dual-citizen Canadians who held citizenship in one of the banned countries . The Toronto Starreported that the Trump administration informed Canada late on Jan. 28 that dual citizenship holders traveling from Canada would not be affected by the order .\n\u201c The word from National Security Adviser Michael Flynn , relayed to the media by Canada \u2019 s Washington embassy , ended a day of confusion and turmoil over a vaguely worded Trump policy that had appeared to ensnare tens of thousands of Canadian citizens and abandon 150 years of border tradition , \u201d the Star wrote .\nOn Feb. 3 , a week after Trump signed the order , the U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a definitive statement \u201c to clarify the classes of aliens affected by the 90-day temporary pause on travel. \u201d It also now provides an FAQ page that answers more than two dozen questions about the order .\nTrump and other administration officials sought to downplay the impact of the temporary travel ban . The president tweeted on Jan. 30 that \u201c only 109 out of 350,000 were detained and held for questioning. \u201d But , as we wrote , the order affected tens of thousands of people . The State Department has estimated that about 60,000 visa holders were affected by the travel ban , and the United Nations estimated that about 20,000 refugees would be affected by the 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program .\nTrump also wrongly said that the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , which unanimously decided on Feb. 9 not to reinstate Trump \u2019 s travel ban , has had its rulings overturned by the Supreme Court \u201c at a record number . \u201d\nTrump : `` In fact , we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number . I have heard 80 % , I find that hard to believe , that is just a number I heard , that they are overturned 80 % of the time . I think that circuit is \u2014 that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil . But we are appealing that , and we are going further . ''\nIn 2015 , the most recent year for available data , the 9th Circuit did have a reversal rate of 80 % , but the 11th Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 % . And the year before that , the 9th Circuit had a reversal rate of 63 % , when four other circuits had 100 % of their rulings overturned .\nAnd over a longer period of time , between 1999 and 2008 , the 9th Circuit , at 80 % , had the second highest reversal rate , according to a 2010 report from the American Bar Association . The highest rate , 83.3 % , belonged to the Federal Circuit . The ABA wrote that the \u201c common perception \u201d that the 9th Circuit is the \u201c rogue circuit \u201d is not true .\nThe ABA noted that the Supreme Court overturns most circuit court decisions that it reviews , but reviews less than 1 % of all circuit court rulings .\nTrump repeated his misleading claim that Hillary Clinton \u201c gave \u201d Russia one-fifth of all U.S. uranium .\nTrump : `` You know , they say I \u2019 m close to Russia . Hillary Clinton gave away 20 % of the uranium in the United States . She \u2019 s close to Russia . ''\nHe \u2019 s wrong on several counts . The deal Clinton had a role in approving gave Russia ownership of 20 % of U.S. production capacity \u2014 not existing stocks of uranium . Furthermore , Clinton alone could not have stopped the deal ; only the president could have done that with a finding that national security would be endangered . Lastly , none of the uranium goes to Russia . That would require export licenses .\nTrump was referring to Clinton \u2019 s role in the 2010 purchase by Russia \u2019 s nuclear agency of Uranium One , a Toronto-based company with mining operations in Kazakhstan , Tanzania and the United States , where the company \u2019 s operations amount to about 20 % of annual U.S. production capacity .\nThe fact is \u2014 as we reported nearly two years ago \u2014 Clinton had no veto power to stop that deal . She was one of nine voting members on the foreign investments committee that unanimously approved it , a panel that also includes the secretaries of the Treasury , Defense , Homeland Security , Commerce and Energy , the attorney general , and representatives from two White House offices \u2014 the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy . ( Separately , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission needed to approve \u2014 and did approve \u2014 the transfer of two uranium recovery licenses as part of the sale . )\nOnly the president could have stopped the sale , and only if at least one member of the foreign investment committee had objected . And even then , the president can not prohibit a transaction without finding \u201c credible evidence \u201d that the \u201c foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security , \u201d according to the federal regulation that governs such matters .\nFinally , Russia may own the mines , but the uranium coming out of them stays in the U.S. As the Nuclear Regulatory Commission noted when it approved the sale , \u201c no uranium produced at either facility may be exported . \u201d\nTrump made the same claim in slightly different words three times during his news conference . It \u2019 s a replay of a bogus accusation he made during last year \u2019 s campaign , when it was debunked by us and other independent fact-checking sites . But constant repetition doesn \u2019 t make a false statement true .\nTrump claimed that \u201c we got 306 \u201d electoral votes \u201c because people came out and voted like they \u2019 ve never seen before so that \u2019 s the way it goes . I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan . \u201d\nActually , Trump finished with 304 electoral votes , since two members of the Texas Electoral College did not cast their votes for Trump even though he won the state .\nAlso , as we \u2019 ve written before , Trump \u2019 s Electoral College victory margin ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections , based on Trump \u2019 s share of the 538 electoral votes . Trump received 56.5 % of the electoral vote .\nSince President Reagan \u2019 s victories in 1980 and 1984 , three presidents have captured a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump did in 2016 . President George H.W . Bush won 79.18 % in 1988 ; President Bill Clinton won 68.77 % in 1992 and 70.45 % in 1996 , and President Barack Obama won 67.84 % in 2008 and 61.71 % in 2012 .\nLater in the press conference , a reporter pointed out that Obama and other presidents since Reagan had received more electoral votes than Trump did . The president clarified that he was talking about just Republicans , but he \u2019 s wrong about that , too , as the reporter pointed out .\n\u201c I was given that information , I don \u2019 t know , \u201d Trump responded . \u201c I was just given it . We had a very , very big margin . \u201d\nTrump claimed that \u201c jobs have already started to surge \u201d since his election , citing investments by Ford , Fiat Chrysler and Intel in new U.S. plants . But much of the U.S. expansion was in the works before Trump was elected , and the investments were largely market driven .\nWhile many corporate leaders \u2014 including at those companies mentioned by Trump \u2014 have praised the president \u2019 s plan to cut regulations and corporate taxes , it is too early to tell how those changes have or will affect the job market overall .\nLet \u2019 s deal with some of the specific claims one at a time .\nTrump : `` Jobs have already started to surge . Since my election , Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico , and will instead invest $ 700 million in Michigan , creating many , many jobs . ''\nAs we wrote when Trump boasted in a tweet two days prior to his inauguration that jobs at Ford and other companies are coming back to the U.S. \u201c because of me , \u201d Trump is giving himself too much credit with Ford .\nFord announced on Jan. 3 that it was canceling its plan to build a $ 1.6 billion plant in Mexico , and that it planned to invest $ 4.5 billion over the next five years to ramp up production of electric cars , including an investment of $ 700 million at its plant in Flat Rock , Mich. , to manufacture two of them .\nThe decision not to build the plant in Mexico , where Ford had planned to build the next generation Ford Focus , was scrapped because \u201c we \u2019 ve seen decreasing demand here in North America for small cars , and we simply don \u2019 t need the capacity anymore , \u201d Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Fox Business News . Instead , he said , Ford will build the Focus in an existing facility in Mexico .\nAs for the investment in electric vehicles , Fields said in announcing the plan that it was a reaction to the reality that \u201c the era of electric vehicles is dawning , \u201d adding that he expected to see production of electric cars exceed traditional gas-powered ones in the next 15 years .\nHost Neil Cavuto asked whether any of the decisions were based on Trump \u2019 s criticisms during the campaign .\n\u201c Well , we \u2019 re doing this based on what \u2019 s right for our business , \u201d Fields said . Fields added that Ford is anticipating \u201c more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under Trump , \u201d and he said the company welcomes some of the \u201c pro-growth policies \u201d such as regulation and business tax changes that Trump talked about during the campaign . Fields said Ford \u2019 s announcement was a \u201c vote of confidence \u201d that the president will deliver on these things .\nFields noted that the 700 new jobs were in addition to the 28,000 the company has added over the last five years . The company also has invested $ 12 billion in U.S. plants over the same period .\n\u201c Would you have done this [ the moves announced ] if Donald Trump were not elected president ? \u201d Cavuto asked .\nTrump : `` Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $ 1 billion in Ohio and Michigan , creating 2,000 new American jobs . ''\nFiat Chrysler announced on Jan. 8 a $ 1 billion investment in plants in Michigan and Ohio , and the addition of 2,000 new American jobs . The company said the investment was part of an ongoing \u201c commitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base , \u201d which has included commitments to invest more than $ 9.6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities , and the creation of 25,000 new jobs to date , since 2009 .\nIn comments the day after the announcement , Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters the announced investments were in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump or his policy ideas , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported .\nRather , he said , \u201c It has been part of the discussion going back to 2015\u2033 negotiations with the United Auto Workers .\nTrump : `` Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with . And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs . ''\nTrump has a stronger case with this example , though the history is a bit complex .\nWhile Intel \u2019 s CEO credited Trump \u2019 s pro-business platform for the recent announcement of a $ 7 billion investment in a new factory in Arizona that will make semiconductor chips \u2014 which he said will result in 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state \u2014 this is actually the second announcement for the facility .\nBack in 2011 , Intel announced a $ 5 billion investment in the same facility , which Obama touted in an early 2012 visit to Arizona .\nIntel began building the shell of that facility several years ago , but the project was left uncompleted because of a lack of \u201c general demand for the product , \u201d a company spokesman told CNN Money .\n\u201c We \u2019 re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect , \u201d Intel spokesman William Moss said . \u201c That said , we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration \u2019 s pro business and pro investment goals . \u201d\nThat praise was echoed by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in an announcement at the White House on Feb. 8 that the project would be moving forward . He credited Trump \u2019 s pro-business platform as the impetus to move forward .\nKrzanich was asked whether there was \u201c something that President Trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now . \u201d\nSaid Krzanich : \u201c It \u2019 s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S . \u201d\nIn the bigger picture , Trump claimed that he \u201c inherited a mess \u201d with \u201c jobs pouring out of the country \u201d when he took office . But as we noted in our Jan. 20 story \u201c What Trump Inherits , \u201d the economy added nearly 2.2 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office . It has gained jobs for 75 straight months \u2013 the longest streak on record .\nThe number of job openings also has continued to hold at near record levels for the last two years . And the unemployment rate , at 4.8 % in January , is well below the historical norm . We won \u2019 t know how Trump is doing on jobs until the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes out with its monthly figures for February , and it may take many more months or even years , to fully evaluate Trump \u2019 s impact on jobs .\nTrump said that \u201c nobody mentions that Hillary [ Clinton ] received the questions to the debates. \u201d As we have written before , there was plenty of press coverage when it was revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared questions with Clinton \u2019 s campaign during the primary election .\nTrump : `` Now , when WikiLeaks , which I had nothing to do with , comes out and happens to give , they \u2019 re not giving classified information . They \u2019 re giving stuff \u2014 what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates . Which , by the way , nobody mentions . Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates . ''\nPerhaps no one mentions it now because the election was over three months ago . But there was plenty of press coverage back in October when emails allegedly obtained from the account of Clinton \u2019 s campaign chairman , John Podesta , revealed that former CNN contributor Brazile shared several town hall and primary debate questions with members of Clinton \u2019 s campaign .\nAccording to the emails , Brazile sent multiple questions to the Clinton campaign before a CNN town hall in mid-March last year , and she sent at least one question to Clinton \u2019 s campaign prior to a Democratic debate earlier that month .\nPolitico and others reported that the hacked emails showed that Brazile sent a town hall question about the death penalty in an email on March 12 , 2016 , to Clinton \u2019 s communications director , Jennifer Palmieri , with the subject line , \u201c From time to time , I get the questions in advance . \u201d\nPolitico also reported that an additional email showed that Brazile forwarded the campaign other town hall questions \u2014 one about unions and another about income inequality . Clinton was asked the question about unions , and Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked about income inequality in the town hall .\nThere were also multiple news reports that another email showed that Brazile tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potential question the day before a Democratic debate between Clinton and Sanders on March 6 in Flint , Mich . In that email , Brazile tells Podesta and Palmieri that \u201c one of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash \u201d who will ask \u201c what if anything will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint . \u201d\nCNN , which was among those that reported on the emails , accepted the resignation of Brazile , the acting DNC chairwoman , on Oct. 14 , three days after the first press reports on the controversy .\nHowever , there is no evidence that Clinton herself directly received any questions .\nAnd though the alleged Clinton campaign emails that WikiLeaks published did not contain classified information , the organization has made classified information public before . For example , in 2010 , WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of classified documents pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that it had obtained from Chelsea Manning , a transgender woman and former Army intelligence officer .\nManning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other counts in August 2013 and sentenced to 35 years in prison . But she is scheduled to be released on May 17 , after then-President Obama commuted her sentence in mid-January .\nTrump also stumbled over the facts when he taunted the reporters questioning him by saying , \u201c People \u2014 I mean , you have a lower approval rate than Congress . I think that \u2019 s right . I don \u2019 t know . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s true that Americans \u2019 trust in the mass media \u201c to report the news fully , accurately and fairly \u201d had dropped to its lowest level since the Gallup organization began asking the question in 1972 , as of Gallup \u2019 s most recent annual report on the subject last September .\nAnd Trump would have been correct to say that trust in the media is even lower than approval of himself . According to Gallup , Trump \u2019 s approval rating stood at 41 % , as of the week ending Feb. 12 , while the public \u2019 s trust in the media was down to 32 % .\nBut even fewer people say they approve of the way Congress is doing its job . As of January , only 19 % said they approve , while 76 % disapproved , according to Gallup .\n'Chaos . ' 'Mess . ' 'Fake news . ' 'Turmoil . ' Trump lets loose at press conference\nRep. Cummings baffled by Trump comments , says he 's been trying to meet\nDemocrats not sold on Trump 's answers , claims in news conference",

For example, that caused confusion for dual-citizen Canadians who held citizenship in one of the banned countries. The Toronto Starreported that the Trump administration informed Canada late on Jan. 28 that dual citizenship holders traveling from Canada would not be affected by the order.\n\n\u201cThe word from National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, relayed to the media by Canada\u2019s Washington embassy, ended a day of confusion and turmoil over a vaguely worded Trump policy that had appeared to ensnare tens of thousands of Canadian citizens and abandon 150 years of border tradition,\u201d the Star wrote.\n\nOn Feb. 3, a week after Trump signed the order, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a definitive statement \u201cto clarify the classes of aliens affected by the 90-day temporary pause on travel.\u201d It also now provides an FAQ page that answers more than two dozen questions about the order.\n\nTrump and other administration officials sought to downplay the impact of the temporary travel ban.

The State Department has estimated that about 60,000 visa holders were affected by the travel ban, and the United Nations estimated that about 20,000 refugees would be affected by the 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nNot a Record on Reversals\n\nTrump also wrongly said that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which unanimously decided on Feb. 9 not to reinstate Trump\u2019s travel ban, has had its rulings overturned by the Supreme Court \u201cat a record number.\u201d\n\nTrump: \"In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.

The ABA wrote that the \u201ccommon perception\u201d that the 9th Circuit is the \u201crogue circuit\u201d is not true.\n\nThe ABA noted that the Supreme Court overturns most circuit court decisions that it reviews, but reviews less than 1% of all circuit court rulings.\n\nUranium Overreach\n\nTrump repeated his misleading claim that Hillary Clinton \u201cgave\u201d Russia one-fifth of all U.S. uranium.\n\nTrump: \"You know, they say I\u2019m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20% of the uranium in the United States. She\u2019s close to Russia.\"\n\nHe\u2019s wrong on several counts. The deal Clinton had a role in approving gave Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. production capacity \u2014 not existing stocks of uranium. Furthermore, Clinton alone could not have stopped the deal; only the president could have done that with a finding that national security would be endangered. Lastly, none of the uranium goes to Russia. That would require export licenses.\n\nTrump was referring to Clinton\u2019s role in the 2010 purchase by Russia\u2019s nuclear agency of Uranium One, a Toronto-based company with mining operations in Kazakhstan, Tanzania and the United States, where the company\u2019s operations amount to about 20% of annual U.S. production capacity.\n\nThe fact is \u2014 as we reported nearly two years ago \u2014 Clinton had no veto power to stop that deal. She was one of nine voting members on the foreign investments committee that unanimously approved it, a panel that also includes the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy, the attorney general, and representatives from two White House offices \u2014 the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. (Separately, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission needed to approve \u2014 and did approve \u2014 the transfer of two uranium recovery licenses as part of the sale.)\n\nOnly the president could have stopped the sale, and only if at least one member of the foreign investment committee had objected. And even then, the president cannot prohibit a transaction without finding \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that the \u201cforeign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security,\u201d according to the federal regulation that governs such matters.\n\nFinally, Russia may own the mines, but the uranium coming out of them stays in the U.S. As the Nuclear Regulatory Commission noted when it approved the sale, \u201cno uranium produced at either facility may be exported.\u201d\n\nTrump made the same claim in slightly different words three times during his news conference. It\u2019s a replay of a bogus accusation he made during last year\u2019s campaign, when it was debunked by us and other independent fact-checking sites. But constant repetition doesn\u2019t make a false statement true.\n\nNo Electoral Bragging Rights\n\nTrump claimed that \u201cwe got 306\u201d electoral votes \u201cbecause people came out and voted like they\u2019ve never seen before so that\u2019s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nActually, Trump finished with 304 electoral votes, since two members of the Texas Electoral College did not cast their votes for Trump even though he won the state.\n\nAlso, as we\u2019ve written before, Trump\u2019s Electoral College victory margin ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections, based on Trump\u2019s share of the 538 electoral votes. Trump received 56.5% of the electoral vote.\n\nSince President Reagan\u2019s victories in 1980 and 1984, three presidents have captured a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump did in 2016. President George H.W. Bush won 79.18% in 1988; President Bill Clinton won 68.77% in 1992 and 70.45% in 1996, and President Barack Obama won 67.84% in 2008 and 61.71% in 2012.\n\nLater in the press conference, a reporter pointed out that Obama and other presidents since Reagan had received more electoral votes than Trump did. The president clarified that he was talking about just Republicans, but he\u2019s wrong about that, too, as the reporter pointed out.\n\n\u201cI was given that information, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI was just given it. We had a very, very big margin.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Jobs Record\n\nTrump claimed that \u201cjobs have already started to surge\u201d since his election, citing investments by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Intel in new U.S. plants. But much of the U.S. expansion was in the works before Trump was elected, and the investments were largely market driven.\n\nWhile many corporate leaders \u2014 including at those companies mentioned by Trump \u2014 have praised the president\u2019s plan to cut regulations and corporate taxes, it is too early to tell how those changes have or will affect the job market overall.\n\nLet\u2019s deal with some of the specific claims one at a time.\n\nTrump: \"Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.\"\n\nAs we wrote when Trump boasted in a tweet two days prior to his inauguration that jobs at Ford and other companies are coming back to the U.S. \u201cbecause of me,\u201d Trump is giving himself too much credit with Ford.\n\nFord announced on Jan. 3 that it was canceling its plan to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and that it planned to invest $4.5 billion over the next five years to ramp up production of electric cars, including an investment of $700 million at its plant in Flat Rock, Mich., to manufacture two of them.\n\nThe decision not to build the plant in Mexico, where Ford had planned to build the next generation Ford Focus, was scrapped because \u201cwe\u2019ve seen decreasing demand here in North America for small cars, and we simply don\u2019t need the capacity anymore,\u201d Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Fox Business News. Instead, he said, Ford will build the Focus in an existing facility in Mexico.\n\nAs for the investment in electric vehicles, Fields said in announcing the plan that it was a reaction to the reality that \u201cthe era of electric vehicles is dawning,\u201d adding that he expected to see production of electric cars exceed traditional gas-powered ones in the next 15 years.\n\nHost Neil Cavuto asked whether any of the decisions were based on Trump\u2019s criticisms during the campaign.\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re doing this based on what\u2019s right for our business,\u201d Fields said. Fields added that Ford is anticipating \u201cmore positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under Trump,\u201d and he said the company welcomes some of the \u201cpro-growth policies\u201d such as regulation and business tax changes that Trump talked about during the campaign. Fields said Ford\u2019s announcement was a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d that the president will deliver on these things.\n\nFields noted that the 700 new jobs were in addition to the 28,000 the company has added over the last five years. The company also has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants over the same period.\n\n\u201cWould you have done this [the moves announced] if Donald Trump were not elected president?\u201d Cavuto asked.\n\n\u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d Fields said.\n\nTrump: \"Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.\"\n\nFiat Chrysler announced on Jan. 8 a $1 billion investment in plants in Michigan and Ohio, and the addition of 2,000 new American jobs. The company said the investment was part of an ongoing \u201ccommitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base,\u201d which has included commitments to invest more than $9.6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities, and the creation of 25,000 new jobs to date, since 2009.\n\nIn comments the day after the announcement, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters the announced investments were in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump or his policy ideas, USA TODAY reported.\n\nRather, he said, \u201cIt has been part of the discussion going back to 2015\u2033 negotiations with the United Auto Workers.\n\nTrump: \"Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.\"\n\nTrump has a stronger case with this example, though the history is a bit complex.\n\nWhile Intel\u2019s CEO credited Trump\u2019s pro-business platform for the recent announcement of a $7 billion investment in a new factory in Arizona that will make semiconductor chips \u2014 which he said will result in 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state \u2014 this is actually the second announcement for the facility.\n\nBack in 2011, Intel announced a $5 billion investment in the same facility, which Obama touted in an early 2012 visit to Arizona.\n\nIntel began building the shell of that facility several years ago, but the project was left uncompleted because of a lack of \u201cgeneral demand for the product,\u201d a company spokesman told CNN Money.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,\u201d Intel spokesman William Moss said. \u201cThat said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration\u2019s pro business and pro investment goals.\u201d\n\nThat praise was echoed by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in an announcement at the White House on Feb. 8 that the project would be moving forward. He credited Trump\u2019s pro-business platform as the impetus to move forward.\n\nKrzanich was asked whether there was \u201csomething that President Trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now.\u201d\n\nSaid Krzanich: \u201cIt\u2019s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.\u201d\n\nIn the bigger picture, Trump claimed that he \u201cinherited a mess\u201d with \u201cjobs pouring out of the country\u201d when he took office. But as we noted in our Jan. 20 story \u201cWhat Trump Inherits,\u201d the economy added nearly 2.2 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office. It has gained jobs for 75 straight months \u2013 the longest streak on record.\n\nThe number of job openings also has continued to hold at near record levels for the last two years. And the unemployment rate, at 4.8% in January, is well below the historical norm. We won\u2019t know how Trump is doing on jobs until the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes out with its monthly figures for February, and it may take many more months or even years, to fully evaluate Trump\u2019s impact on jobs.\n\nNo Question on Debate Coverage\n\nTrump said that \u201cnobody mentions that Hillary [Clinton] received the questions to the debates.\u201d As we have written before, there was plenty of press coverage when it was revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared questions with Clinton\u2019s campaign during the primary election.\n\nTrump: \"Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they\u2019re not giving classified information. They\u2019re giving stuff \u2014 what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.\"\n\nPerhaps no one mentions it now because the election was over three months ago. But there was plenty of press coverage back in October when emails allegedly obtained from the account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, revealed that former CNN contributor Brazile shared several town hall and primary debate questions with members of Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nAccording to the emails, Brazile sent multiple questions to the Clinton campaign before a CNN town hall in mid-March last year, and she sent at least one question to Clinton\u2019s campaign prior to a Democratic debate earlier that month.\n\nPolitico and others reported that the hacked emails showed that Brazile sent a town hall question about the death penalty in an email on March 12, 2016, to Clinton\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, with the subject line, \u201cFrom time to time, I get the questions in advance.\u201d\n\nPolitico also reported that an additional email showed that Brazile forwarded the campaign other town hall questions \u2014 one about unions and another about income inequality. Clinton was asked the question about unions, and Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked about income inequality in the town hall.\n\nThere were also multiple news reports that another email showed that Brazile tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potential question the day before a Democratic debate between Clinton and Sanders on March 6 in Flint, Mich. In that email, Brazile tells Podesta and Palmieri that \u201cone of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash\u201d who will ask \u201cwhat if anything will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\u201d\n\nCNN, which was among those that reported on the emails, accepted the resignation of Brazile, the acting DNC chairwoman, on Oct. 14, three days after the first press reports on the controversy.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Clinton herself directly received any questions.\n\nAnd though the alleged Clinton campaign emails that WikiLeaks published did not contain classified information, the organization has made classified information public before. For example, in 2010, WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of classified documents pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that it had obtained from Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman and former Army intelligence officer.\n\nManning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other counts in August 2013 and sentenced to 35 years in prison. But she is scheduled to be released on May 17, after then-President Obama commuted her sentence in mid-January.\n\nMedia Approval\n\nTrump also stumbled over the facts when he taunted the reporters questioning him by saying, \u201cPeople \u2014 I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nNo, that\u2019s not right.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Americans\u2019 trust in the mass media \u201cto report the news fully, accurately and fairly\u201d had dropped to its lowest level since the Gallup organization began asking the question in 1972, as of Gallup\u2019s most recent annual report on the subject last September.\n\nAnd Trump would have been correct to say that trust in the media is even lower than approval of himself. According to Gallup, Trump\u2019s approval rating stood at 41%, as of the week ending Feb. 12, while the public\u2019s trust in the media was down to 32%.\n\nBut even fewer people say they approve of the way Congress is doing its job. As of January, only 19% said they approve, while 76% disapproved, according to Gallup.\n\nUSA TODAY coverage from the Trump press conference:\n\n'Chaos.' 'Mess.' 'Fake news.' 'Turmoil.'
