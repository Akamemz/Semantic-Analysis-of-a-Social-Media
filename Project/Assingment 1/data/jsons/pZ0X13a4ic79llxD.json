    "content": "Facebook and Twitter were in the spotlight again on Wednesday . The Senate Judiciary Committee grilled the companies ' top execs over a perceived anti-conservative bias , with some Republicans renewing calls for government regulation of social media platforms .\nSen. Ted Cruz ( R\u2013Texas ) opened the hearing , saying that `` nobody\u2014or at least nobody in their right mind\u2014wants to see a government speech police . '' But he outlined several ways where he wants government intervention . Most notably , he suggested that social media networks could lose their status under Section 230 , which protects the content-sharing companies from various lawsuits .\nIf that happened , Facebook and Twitter would be liable for any and all libelous comments made on their sites\u2014a tall order , especially when you remember that Facebook gets a billion new posts each day . Such a move would almost certainly lead to increased censorship , with tech companies actively seeking to quash comments that might attract lawsuits .\nCruz also proposed using antitrust laws to break up big tech , and he said that cases of alleged censorship could be litigated as fraud .\nWhether or not social media platforms push an anti-conservative agenda has been a matter of ongoing debate , as much of the evidence is anecdotal . Sen. Marsha Blackburn ( R\u2013Tenn . ) mentioned that her campaign announcement video was temporarily removed from Twitter in 2017 after it was deemed inflammatory . She likened social media to a `` town square , '' saying a sheriff\u2014in this case the federal government\u2014is necessary to preserve fairness and order . Carlos J. Monje , Jr. , the director of public policy and philanthropy for Twitter 's presence in U.S. and Canada , apologized and said the company had `` made the wrong call '' in taking down her ad .\nMeanwhile , ranking member Mazie Hirono ( D\u2013Hawaii ) lambasted the notion that social media platforms discriminate against conservatives . She named a number of anti-bias efforts undertaken by social media platforms to appease Republicans and listed a range of experts who had found no evidence to support such claims . That social media companies are blind to ideology can be seen in the case of Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D\u2013Mass . ) , Hirono argued . Not unlike Blackburn , the liberal presidential hopeful recently had a campaign ad removed by Facebook .\nHirono claimed that the real threat is the online proliferation of conspiracy theories and hate speech , which she said requires more rigorous moderation . `` I hope that going forward , this subcommittee will focus on the real issues facing America , like hate speech , like voter suppression , like looking into the emoluments clause , '' noted Hirono .\nFrancesca Tripodi , a sociologist at James Madison University , testified that her research shows `` conservative content creators excel at search engine and social media optimization . ''\nThroughout the hearing , Cruz focused heavily on pro-life sentiment , which has been at the center of the censorship dispute . The senator introduced a briefly blocked tweet from Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List , which features a Mother Teresa quote characterizing abortion as `` profoundly anti-women . '' Monje said that pro-choice groups have had content removed when they , too , were in violation of Twitter 's policies\u2014although what those policies are remains unclear .\nHe also rejected allegations that Twitter has a bias against any political ideology , referencing an internal study that found no statistically significant difference in the number of people that see tweets from Democrats versus Republicans .\nNeil Potts , the public policy director at Facebook , also pushed back on the accusations of bias . `` We are committed to encouraging dialogue and the free flow of ideas , '' he said , citing a laundry list of internal efforts meant to ensure ideological diversity in content review efforts . `` We take that neutrality seriously . ''\nBut Cruz pressed Potts on Facebook 's stance against hate speech , raising concerns over the company 's history of removing posts that are deemed emotionally injurious .\nNot all Republicans on the committee expressed a desire to monitor social media practices . `` I differ from some of my colleagues in the approach I take to this , '' said Sen. Mike Lee ( R\u2013Utah ) . `` I do n't view you as a public utility . I do n't view you as being owned by the government , but some of my colleagues see it differently . '' Yet in a moment of cringeworthy political theatre , Lee angrily pressed both execs to concede that their respective companies are dominated by liberal employees . They almost certainly are , as both are based in Silicon Valley . But it 's information that neither is privy to .\nThe hearing likely accomplished very little\u2014if anything\u2014as Democrats and Republicans stood firm in their respective positions .
