    "content": "A fringe group of far-right activists have been disrupting conservative and pro-Trump events in recent weeks , drawing rebukes from mainstream Republicans who are eager to separate the party from white nationalists and alt-right racists .\nA small but vocal group of young men led by 21-year-old broadcaster Nicholas Fuentes received national attention this week after heckling Donald Trump Jr. at an event in California , where he was promoting his new book `` Triggered . ''\nFuentes and others on the far right have been publishing calendars of events held by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk , conservative media stars Ben Shapiro and David Rubin and others , including Trump Jr. and Rep. Dan Crenshaw ( R-Texas ) , in an effort to have their followers infiltrate and disrupt the events .\nThe alt-right activists view Kirk and Shapiro as insufficiently conservative on issues like immigration and claim to be carrying the mantle for President Trump . Members often show up at the events wearing red Make America Great Again hats and Fuentes 's show is called `` America First '' in a nod to the president 's popular slogan .\nShapiro , who is Jewish , and others have described the disruptions as an insidious effort to smuggle racist and anti-Semitic ideologies into the conservative mainstream .\nAt a speech at Stanford University this week , Shapiro lashed out at Fuentes , calling him a `` garbage human being '' whose views are `` obviously white supremacist garbage . ''\nShapiro did not call out Fuentes by name , as he and others are worried that fighting back will elevate the fringe group and give them more attention than they deserve .\nBut it was clear that Shapiro was directing his fire at Fuentes , whom he characterized as the leader of the next wave of the alt-right movement .\n`` Some call themselves 'America First ' to hijack President Trump 's slogans to give themselves a patina of credibility ... you 're seeing them adopt the beliefs of some of these other movements in order to find cover for their own vile belief system , '' Shapiro said .\nFuentes 's followers are called `` Groypers '' and identify themselves with the image of a fat , green frog , who looks similar to the original alt-right `` Pepe '' character .\nFuentes 's YouTube show has been a factory for bigoted , anti-Semitic and racist content .\nThe 21-year old attended the `` Unite the Right '' white supremacist rally in Charlottesville , Va. , in 2017 , and later posted on his Facebook page : `` The ruthless transnational elite know a tidal wave of white identity is coming and know that once the word gets out they will not be able to stop us .

Today we 've got a Jew . ''\nAnd in another anti-Semitic segment , Fuentes questioned whether the Holocaust took place , while likening the burning bodies of Jews to cookies baking in an oven .\n`` The math does n't seem to add up there , '' Fuentes said . `` I do n't think you 'd result in 6 million . Maybe 200 to 300 thousand cookies . ''\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Fuentes insisted that he is not racist , anti-Semitic or a white nationalist .
