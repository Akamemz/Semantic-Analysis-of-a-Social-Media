''\nI want to thank Chairman Grassley for introducing legislation based on the White House Immigration Reform and Border Security Framework . The Grassley bill accomplishes the four pillars of the White House Framework : a lasting solution on DACA , ending chain migration , cancelling the visa lottery , and securing the border through building the wall and closing legal loopholes . I am asking all senators , in both parties , to support the Grassley bill and to oppose any legislation that fails to fulfill these four pillars \u2013 that includes opposing any short-term `` Band-Aid '' approach . The overwhelming majority of American voters support a plan that fulfills the Framework 's four pillars , which move us towards the safe , modern , and lawful immigration system our people deserve .\nGrassley had previously introduced `` The Secure and Succeed Act '' with Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton . The bill would provide a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA recipients , $ 25 billion in border security and wall funding , limits on family-based migration , and would eliminate the diversity visa lottery . It 's unclear if the president has since suggested changes to the original version of Grassley 's legislation . There are currently no Democrats who have said they support this measure .
