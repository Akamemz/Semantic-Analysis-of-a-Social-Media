He is the author of the forthcoming book `` United States of Jihad : Investigating America 's Homegrown Terrorists . ''\nLike many of Trump 's charges this one does n't hold much water . Clinton left the State Department in January 2013 and ISIS was n't even founded until three months later .\nBut Trump 's charge does raise an interesting question , which is how best to assign responsibility for the rise of ISIS , including the issue of how might the Obama administration 's exit from Iraq at the end of 2011 have helped smooth the path for ISIS ?\nThe rise of ISIS starts with a Jordanian thug named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who founded ISIS ' parent organization , al Qaeda in Iraq .\nIt was Zarqawi who inaugurated al Qaeda in Iraq 's televised beheadings with the killing of American businessman Nick Berg in 2004 . And it was Zarqawi who ignited a civil war against the Shiites in Iraq the same year . These tactics and policies remain today at the core of ISIS .\nWhat gave Zarqawi the opportunity to create al Qaeda in Iraq ? It was , of course , George W. Bush 's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 . Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein brutally repressed all forms of opposition to his regime and before the Iraq War al Qaeda had no presence in Iraq .\nAl Qaeda in Iraq grew in strength in 2006 so that it controlled much of the massive Anbar province in western Iraq . At the beginning of 2007 , Bush authorized a surge of new troops and brought in a new commander , David Petraeus . Allied with a movement of Sunni tribesmen angered by al Qaeda known as `` the Awakening , '' U.S. troops had largely extirpated al Qaeda from Iraq by 2008 .\nSo how did al Qaeda in Iraq surge back as ISIS ?\nThere are four big factors . The first is the Syrian civil war , which launched in 2011 in reaction to President Bashar al-Assad 's brutal repression of peaceful protests against his dictatorship . Elements of what would become ISIS traveled from Iraq into Syria to fight against Assad . Those forces gained strength in Syria , which they drew upon when they re-entered Iraq as a reinvigorated force in 2013 , seizing much of Anbar a year later as well as Mosul , the second-largest city in Iraq .\nThe second factor was the role that some of Hussein 's former officer corps played in helping ISIS to its victories . A number of the late dictator 's former commanders helped to professionalize ISIS as a fighting force . ( The Bush administration 's decision to disband the Iraqi army in 2003 had helped push some Iraqi officers to join Sunni militant groups . )\nThe third factor was the feckless and incompetent rule of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki , who marginalized Sunnis and disenfranchised them from Iraq 's political process to the point that many Sunnis preferred the rule of the Islamist militants in ISIS to that of the `` Shia '' government in Baghdad . Inexplicably , the Obama White House kept backing Maliki despite his manifest flaws as a leader .\nThe fourth factor was the hollowing out of the Iraqi army , which simply ran away as ISIS made its most dramatic advances during the first half of 2014 . The Iraqi army was poorly led , poorly paid and riven with corruption .\nNone of these factors can be easily ascribed to Obama or to Clinton , although certainly they did preside over the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 , a plan bequeathed to them by Bush .\nCould the Obama administration have fought harder to retain a U.S. troop presence in Iraq ? Possibly .\nWould the Iraqi government have allowed such a presence ? Not likely as the Iraq government was by the time of the U.S. withdrawal more aligned with Iran than with the United States .\nObama was also slow to recognize the threat posed by ISIS , famously referring to the Islamist terrorist group gaining ground in Syria and Iraq as a `` JV '' team in a January 2014 interview .\nSince the summer of 2014 the Obama administration has mounted -- at least from the air -- an aggressive campaign against ISIS , but it has proven reluctant to do much on the ground .\nCould more be done ? Yes . More U.S. Special Forces fighting side by side with Iraqi forces and more U.S. forward air controllers calling in close air support would certainly help the Iraqi military against ISIS .\nIn Syria , a no-fly zone targeted at Assad 's air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help tamp down the death toll that plays into the hands of ISIS and other Sunni militants who can position themselves as the only groups that are really defending the Sunni population .\nRather than making loose and unsubstantiated claims that Obama and Clinton created ISIS , it would behoove Trump if he advanced some real policy ideas about how to solve the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars . Of course , to do that he would have to get beyond the inflammatory slogans and sound bites that have characterized his campaign .",
