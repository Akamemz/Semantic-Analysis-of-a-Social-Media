The nurse 's refusal to stay in her home has ignited debate over whether she should be considered a hero for volunteering to fight Ebola in West Africa or a selfish danger to the public .\nTV personality Piers Morgan made his opinion clear in a harshly worded opinion piece in the Daily Mail in which he called Hickox \u201c utterly selfish. \u201d \u201c Nurse Hickox should stop her pathetic squealing , fire her lawyer , get off TV , thank her lucky stars she 's not got Ebola , and stay inside her damn home for the next couple of weeks to ensure there 's not a tiny scintilla of chance she could infect a fellow American , \u201d he argued .\nOthers sought to quell fears . Charles Blow , of the New York Times , said Hickox \u201c is a paladin being treated like a leper , \u201d and that mandatory quarantines would discourage health workers from volunteering in West Africa .\nHickox , a 33-year-old nurse , spent a month treating Ebola patients in West Africa with Doctors Without Borders and returned to the U.S. last week through Liberty International Airport in Newark , New Jersey .

At the time of her travels , a New York doctor tested positive for the virus after returning from treating Ebola in West Africa , prompting Christie and New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo to announce a new policy requiring any health care workers returning from treating Ebola patients to be quarantined for 21 days . Hickox was released on Monday , reportedly following pressure on Christie from the Obama Administration . She was allowed to go home to Maine , where she was expected to stay in isolation .\nShe tested negative for the virus while in quarantine in New Jersey , but Hickox \u2019 s blood wouldn \u2019 t test positive for the virus until she was symptomatic , so there \u2019 s still a possibility that she does have Ebola .
