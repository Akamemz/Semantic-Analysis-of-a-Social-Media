    "content": "While Marco Rubio was flailing in Florida , Ted Cruz \u2019 s team was lying in wait , preparing to move state by state , donor by donor to capture Rubio \u2019 s supporters after his fall . And with Rubio out , that effort is now in full swing .\nEven before Rubio formally exited the race , Cruz \u2019 s team was communicating with donors and other prominent Rubio supporters \u2014 Cruz senior foreign policy adviser Victoria Coates , for example , was checking in with people like prominent Bush administration figure and Rubio backer Elliott Abrams .\nWhen Rubio did drop , the Texan \u2019 s team sprang into action across the country .\nIn Utah , his leadership team moved to lock down the Florida senator \u2019 s lengthy list of legislative endorsements before next Tuesday \u2019 s caucus . Cruz is planning to meet with Gov . Gary Herbert Saturday at a campaign kickoff event for Utah Sen. Mike Lee , another Cruz ally . In Washington , several of Rubio \u2019 s national security advisers signed on with Cruz \u2014 after , in part , courting from Coates . And nationally , Cruz \u2019 s money team is making the case to Rubio \u2019 s former donors that Cruz \u2019 s time has come .\nTheir message : The party is running out of time to stop Donald Trump \u2014 and Cruz is the only one who can do it .\n\u201c We need to unite , \u201d said Chris Herrod , a former Utah state legislator who is Cruz \u2019 s campaign coordinator in the state , characterizing his message to former Rubio backers . \u201c The only person that can beat Donald Trump right now is Sen. Cruz . \u201d\nThe broad-based , national effort comes as Cruz seeks to consolidate the anti-Trump wing of the GOP behind his campaign . He lags well behind Trump in delegates , but his team is hopeful that with a united party behind him , he \u2019 ll turn that deficit into a lead by the time the he heads to the Republican National Convention in July . They insist he could do even better : assemble enough delegates to score an outright win \u2014 though that \u2019 s a path that has narrowed dramatically and remains a long-shot for Cruz .\nA win in Utah on Tuesday , however , would be a significant first step toward catching up in the delegate count , and Cruz enjoyed a boost toward that goal Friday when former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney\u2014whom Cruz has frequently criticized -- said he would vote for Cruz in Utah over Trump and over Ohio Gov . John Kasich .\n\u201c A vote for Governor Kasich in future contests makes it extremely likely that Trumpism would prevail , \u201d Romney wrote in a Facebook post , echoing Cruz \u2019 s argument . \u201c I will vote for Senator Cruz and I encourage others to do so as well , so that we can have an open convention and nominate a Republican . \u201d\nState Republicans will dole out 40 delegates when they hold caucuses . Cruz could grab them all by scoring more than 50 percent of the vote . If no candidate hits that threshold , the delegates get divvied up proportionally .\nRubio had the monopoly on Utah legislative endorsements , but now that he \u2019 s out , Herrod and others on Cruz \u2019 s team in the state are working the phones and tapping their political relationships , seeking to bring over ex-Rubio supporters to Cruz . It \u2019 s an approach the campaign is expected to replicate in other states that vote down the line , including in Arizona , which also votes next week .\nHerrod passed along the names of two state representatives , Mike Noel and Brad Daw , who had been backing Rubio and were now , he said , with Cruz . Five others , he said , were on the sidelines until this week but have now also come on board .\nCruz \u2019 s team is echoing that message , of the importance of unifying around one candidate , to donors across the country .\n\u201c There \u2019 s only two serious candidates , \u201d said Mica Mosbacher , a Houston-based fundraiser for Cruz , referring to the Texas senator and to Trump . \u201c What I \u2019 ve said is , some people are going to have to say the Serenity Prayer . Neither one may be their favorite flavor or first choice , but if they want to defeat Hillary , they \u2019 re going to have to choose a candidate . Cruz \u2019 s strength is , he \u2019 s whip smart . He sells the steak , not the sizzle . \u201d\nFormer Rubio supporters say they \u2019 ve heard that argument , which often comes infused with a dose of alarm over Trump .\n\u201c Their pitch is very direct : He \u2019 s the guy who can stop Trump , \u201d said a former Rubio backer who has heard it . \u201c They walk through the next series of elections coming , primaries , and give a very clear-eyed , realistic assessment of what their chances are , how they \u2019 re going to go forward , what they \u2019 re asking for . It is a very clear appeal in that sense . \u201d\nBut Cruz faces long odds in his effort to beat Trump outright before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July , and even his plan B\u2014going into the convention as the delegate leader\u2014looks to be an uphill battle . Trump has 678 delegates , Cruz has 413 , and the Northeastern and industrial Midwestern-heavy map going forward is not natural Cruz territory .\nStill , he has far more delegates than does Kasich , who has only 143 after winning only Ohio\u2014his home state\u2014outright . The Cruz campaign \u2019 s hope is twofold : that the calendar going forward , which features many closed primaries in which only Republicans can vote , will be friendly terrain as they seek to mobilize conservatives ; and that he will be boosted by an influx of supporters who previously backed other candidates , like Rubio .\nYet it \u2019 s unclear how much of a groundswell of ex-Rubio support he can expect . There has been no rush in the Senate\u2014where Rubio enjoyed plenty of endorsements -- to get behind Cruz : he currently has support from only two of his colleagues , Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and the virulently anti-Trump Lindsey Graham .\nAnd some Rubio donors are planning to either focus on House and Senate races or simply stay out of politics for the moment , as many of Rubio 's key advisers also remain on the sidelines for now .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been a Rubio guy from the beginning , \u201d said George Seay , a prominent Texas-based GOP donor who knows the Cruz team well . \u201c That \u2019 s where I sit today\u2026I don \u2019 t just hop from campaign to campaign . \u201d\nBut Cruz has also seen some prominent pro-Rubio forces come out for him , including South Carolina Gov . Nikki Haley , and Graham , whose support for Cruz\u2014after saying he preferred Rubio\u2014is remarkable , given how openly he previously detested his Texas colleague . He will now headline a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday .\nMosbacher said Haley \u2019 s backing of Cruz , in particular , was something internalized and valued by former Rubio supporters .\nAnd on Friday , Cruz \u2019 s campaign announced that former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm would be spearheading outreach to members of Congress .\n\u201c We \u2019 re down in a critical period in this election where more and more Republicans recognize the fact that Donald Trump would be a disastrous nominee , \u201d Cruz communications director Alice Stewart added . \u201c The only way to stop that from happening is to get behind the true , consistent conservative in this race that can and has beaten Donald Trump . \u201d\nRubio himself told supporters this week that Cruz was the \u201c only conservative left in the race , \u201d according to a report .\nOn Thursday , two prominent members of Rubio \u2019 s national security team\u2014Elliott Abrams , the former high-ranking national security official in the Bush administration , and former Sen.
