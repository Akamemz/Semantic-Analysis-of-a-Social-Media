    "content": "On Friday , Google removed the Infowars Android app from its Play Store , extinguishing one of the last mainstream strongholds of infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones . The takedown comes on the heels of a video , posted in the Infowars app last week and viewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , in which Jones disputed the need for social distancing , shelter in place , and quarantine efforts meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus .\nGoogle confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it removed the app on Friday . The app had more than 100,000 downloads according to Google Play 's published metrics , and was rated `` E10+ , '' meaning safe for all users 10 and older . The Infowars app sold products like supplements and protein powder , broadcast The Alex Jones Show live , and posted videos and articles from Jones and others .\n`` Now more than ever , combating misinformation on the Play Store is a top priority for the team , '' a Google spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` When we find apps that violate Play policy by distributing misleading or harmful information , we remove them from the store . ''\nAlex Jones and Infowars did not immediately respond to a request for comment . In the video in question , Jones said that `` everybody dies under the new world order except maybe one tenth of one percent that believe they 're going to merge with machines and have made deals with this inter-dimensional thing that gave them all the technology ... You ca n't make a deal with these aliens , OK , that the Bible tells you about and ever get off the planet . '' Elsewhere in the video , Jones claims that natural antivirals exist to treat the novel coronavirus .\nGoogle is far from the first tech giant to block or ban Infowars content . In fact , Google-owned YouTube suspended The Alex Jones Channel in August 2018 , after mounting pressure from critics that platforms should enforce their anti-hate speech policies . Facebook took action against several Jones-operated pages that same day , as did Twitter with Infowars-related accounts the next month . Facebook instituted a full ban of Alex Jones and Infowars content across all of its platforms in May 2019 . Apple 's iOS App Store , Google Play 's main competitor , already banned the Infowars app more than a year ago during the late summer 2018 blitz .\nIn the wake of all the mainstream bans , Jones and his supporters have repeatedly maintained that blocking Infowars and Jones ' content only spreads it farther and makes it more popular . But research indicates that so-called `` deplatforming '' actions do effectively reduce the spread of hate speech , misinformation , and conspiracy theories . The bigger question is why Google waited so long to take action against Infowars given that its peer organizations did so a year and a half ago .\nTech services and social networks have long touted their role as defenders of free speech . But rampant abuse , misinformation , and coordinated disinformation campaigns carried out by nation states on the platforms have brought the industry to a new understanding in recent years of its necessary role in policing violent and dangerous content . The industry has also specifically moved to crack down on misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic in the last few weeks .
