    "content": "There are three problems you could have imagined the manager \u2019 s amendment to the American Health Care Act trying to fix :\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the AHCA will lead 24 million more Americans to go uninsured , push millions more into the kind of super-high-deductible care Republicans criticized in the Affordable Care Act , and all that will happen while the richest Americans get hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts . Voters \u2014 including the downscale rural whites who propelled Donald Trump into the presidency \u2014 aren \u2019 t going to like any of that . Virtually every health policy analyst from every side of the aisle thinks the AHCA is poorly constructed and will lead to consequences even its drafters didn \u2019 t intend . Avik Roy argues there are huge implicit tax increases for the poor who get jobs that lift them out of Medicaid \u2019 s ranks . Bob Laszewski thinks the plan will drive healthy people out of the insurance markets , creating even worse premium increases than we \u2019 re seeing under Obamacare . Implementing this bill , as drafted , would be a disaster . As written , the AHCA is unlikely to pass the House , and so GOP leadership needs to give House conservatives more reasons to vote for the bill , even if those reasons leave the legislation less likely to succeed in the Senate . For this bill to fail in the House would embarrass Speaker Paul Ryan and President Trump .\nOf the three problems in the AHCA , the third is by far the least serious \u2014 but it \u2019 s the only one the manager \u2019 s amendment even attempts to solve .
