The lawyer for a third U.S. swimmer said he would make a $ 10,800 payment and leave Brazil later in the day .\nThe drama surrounding the alleged robbery of American swimmers \u2014 and their ever-changing descriptions of it \u2014 has shocked and deeply angered Brazilians , who said it cast a false negative shadow on their city and their Olympics . The story has also dominated Olympic headlines , overshadowing the worthy accomplishments of athletes who had trained for years just to get to Rio and set records during their performances at these Olympics .\nThe rapid-fire developments early Friday came hours after police announced that Ryan Lochte and three of his teammates had not been held at gunpoint after a night of partying , as he claimed . Instead , Brazilian police said the men , while intoxicated , vandalized a gas station bathroom and were questioned by armed guards before they paid for the damage and left .\nThe saga was an enormous embarrassment for the U.S. Olympic team , which had otherwise dominated the games .
