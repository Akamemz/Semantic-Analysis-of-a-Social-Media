But other Republicans said it contained measures that could show promise .\nWhile the nearly 2,500-page budget package is stuffed with different proposals , including higher taxes on cigarettes and spending on climate-change research , there are a handful of items the White House hopes could be the seeds of a broad deficit-reduction deal later this year .\nPresident Obama held a press conference in the White House Rose Garden to announce his budget plan for the 2014 fiscal year .\nThese include slowing the growth of spending on programs such as Social Security by $ 130 billion over 10 years by using a different inflation measure for calculating annual cost-of-living increases , and making $ 370 billion in changes to Medicare through cuts to providers and raising certain fees and premiums . Many Democrats have long objected to cutting future benefits or spending on these programs , and adding them to the White House 's budget infuriated liberals and labor unions .\nBut the president offered no apologies . `` I am willing to make tough choices that may not be popular within my own party , because there can be no sacred cows for either party , '' Mr. Obama said Wednesday .

Many Republicans say much more needs to be done , but White House officials say their new budget would bring the total deficit reduction to more than $ 4 trillion over 10 years .\nHouse Republicans and Senate Democrats already have passed budget resolutions , meaning the long-delayed White House proposal can be viewed as a political document aimed at influencing deficit-reduction discussions .\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) said he saw little `` common ground '' in a plan that raised taxes , increased spending and made `` minuscule '' deficit reductions . `` We had hoped the president would have done something larger than this , bigger than this , for the beginning of his second term , '' he said .\nWSJ reporter Janet Hook explains why the Obama budget is arriving so late , and looks at whether there is any realistic hope Democrats and Republicans will find common fiscal ground .\nMr. Obama and 12 GOP senators dined at the White House Wednesday evening to discuss these and other issues , the second such gathering in recent weeks that administration officials hope will help build trust between the two parties and lead to further talks .\nAfter the meal\u2014which lasted nearly three hours and included green salad , steak and saut\u00e9ed vegetables\u2014a White House official said the president had enjoyed a constructive , wide-ranging discussion on topics including the deficit , immigration and gun violence .\nSen.
