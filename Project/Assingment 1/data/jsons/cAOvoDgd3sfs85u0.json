I think it \u2019 s going to have to be something that is not one size fits all . \u201d\nFauci said , \u201c You know , I think it could probably start at least in some ways maybe next month . And again , Jake , it \u2019 s so difficult to make those kinds of predictions , because they always get thrown back at you if it doesn \u2019 t happen , not by you , but , you know , by any number of people . We are hoping by the end of the month . We can look around and say , \u2018 OK , is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on , \u2019 if so , do it . If not , then just continue to hunker down . And that \u2019 s what , at least from the standpoint of the public health aspect , that we look at . Other decisions to be made at the level of the president and the governors about what they are going to do with all of the information they get . \u201d",
