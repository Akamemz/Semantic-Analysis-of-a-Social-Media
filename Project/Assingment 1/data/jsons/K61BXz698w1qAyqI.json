    "content": "WASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The Trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the United States , challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the Obama era , according to data reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe more intense scrutiny of the applications for H-1B visas comes after President Donald Trump called for changes to the visa program so that it benefits the highest-paid workers , though he has not enacted any such reforms .\nData provided by U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services shows that between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31 , the agency issued 85,000 challenges , or \u201c requests for evidence \u201d ( RFEs ) , to H-1B visa petitions - a 45 percent increase over the same period last year . The total number of H-1B petitions rose by less than 3 percent in the same period .\nThe challenges , which can slow down the issuance of visas by months , were issued at a greater rate in 2017 than at any time in the Obama administration except for one year , 2009 , according to the USCIS data , which has not been previously reported .\nThe trend is likely to cheer supporters of Trump \u2019 s hardline stance on immigration . They say visas for skilled foreigners undercut American workers by replacing them with low-paid employees shipped in from abroad . But major tech companies , universities and hospitals contend the visas allow them to fill highly specialized jobs for which there are sometimes few qualified Americans .\nH-1B visas allow foreign workers , generally with bachelor 's degrees or higher , to work for three years at a time , often in the technology , healthcare and education sectors . Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) , Amazon ( AMZN.O ) , Google ( GOOGL.O ) , Apple ( AAPL.O ) , Intel ( INTC.O ) , Oracle ( ORCL.N ) and Facebook ( FB.O ) were heavy users of H-1B visas in 2016 , according to USCIS data .\nThe USCIS inquiries typically challenge the basis of the original petitions and assert that the employers do not qualify for the visas . Employers and their lawyers must then provide further evidence to prove their need and eligibility for the visas .\nTo be sure , the Obama administration also issued a large number of H-1B challenges \u2013 nearly 59,000 - from January through August 2016 , and a similar number in 2015 .\nImmigration attorneys have for years complained about redundant and burdensome challenges to high-skilled employment visas . But they say they are seeing a new trend in the Trump era .\nIn addition to querying applications more often , the Trump administration is targeting entry-level jobs offered to skilled foreigners . The lawyers say this violates the law governing H-1Bs , because it allows for visa holders to take entry-level jobs .\nSeveral attorneys said they view the increase in challenges and focus on entry-level jobs as a stealth campaign by the administration against the H-1B program in the absence of public regulatory changes or changes passed by Congress , which could be debated and decided in the open .\n\u201c One way to have an immigration policy that \u2019 s consistent with the policy that \u2019 s been articulated by the Trump administration is to put more scrutiny on H-1B cases , \u201d said Cyrus Mehta , a New York-based immigration attorney .\nUSCIS spokesman Robert C. Langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyers or the sharp spike in RFEs this year . In an email , he said the agency is applying \u201c currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirements to evaluate petitions . \u201d\nPartners HealthCare is a healthcare system that includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women \u2019 s Hospital , two prestigious teaching hospitals for Harvard Medical School .
