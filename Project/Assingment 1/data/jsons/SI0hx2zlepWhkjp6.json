Report: ACA abortion rules ignored\n\nThere are widespread instances of Obamacare insurance plans violating the rigid rules surrounding whether customers can use federal health care subsidies on insurance policies that cover abortion procedures, according to a Government Accountability Office investigation.\n\nThe report, commissioned by House Republican leadership and obtained by POLITICO on Monday night, found that 15 insurers in a sample of 18 are selling Obamacare plans that do not segregate funds to cover abortion (except in cases of rape, incest or the mother\u2019s life) from their Obamacare subsidies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires that insurers collect separate payments from customers for abortion coverage so that taxpayer money in the form of subsidies do not cover abortions. Adoption of the complex payment scheme \u2014 which essentially requires customers to send two separate payments to their insurers \u2014 was pivotal to getting the health law through Congress. Anti-abortion Democrats brokered the arrangement shortly before the law passed, threatening to vote against it without the restrictive language.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 115K to lose health coverage)\n\nThe report\u2019s release is likely to elicit new election-year attacks on congressional Democrats from anti-abortion groups and Republicans who warned that Obamacare would allow for taxpayer subsidized abortions.\n\nAmong a sample of 18 insurers, \u201call but three issuers indicated that the [abortion coverage] benefit is not subject to any restrictions, limitations, or exclusions,\u201d the GAO wrote in its report.\n\nThe vast majority of people who bought coverage on the exchanges did so with subsidies. According to government figures, 87 percent of the 5.4 million people who bought a plan on HealthCare.gov in the last enrollment period did so with at least some subsidy .\n\nThere is no data provided on how many plans have paid for abortions so far.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP could chip away at Obamacare)\n\nThe GAO report found that in Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, all insurance plans offered on the exchanges cover abortions above and beyond the exceptions for rape, incest and the mother\u2019s life.
