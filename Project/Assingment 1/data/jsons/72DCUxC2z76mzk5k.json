    "content": "Conservative critics of President Obama \u2019 s health care reforms are engaged in two long-shot lawsuits to overturn the Affordable Care Act or disable one of its central provisions . Both lawsuits should be recognized for what they really are \u2014 attempts to use the courts to scuttle a law that Congressional Republicans have repeatedly tried , but failed , to repeal through the political process .\nOne case , now before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , makes the specious argument that the entire law should be overturned because the bill did not \u201c originate \u201d in the House . The suit was brought by a conservative legal foundation on behalf of an Iowa artist who does not want to buy health insurance or pay a fine , as the law requires . The lawyers build their entire case on the legislative procedure used when the reform law was passed .\nThe act started out as a House bill to modify tax credits for certain first-time home buyers and increase the estimated tax payments owed by corporations . That bill passed the House by a vote of 416 to 0 in late 2009 . When it got to the Senate , the text and title of the bill were struck and replaced with the text and title of the Affordable Care Act . That version of the bill passed the Senate in late 2009 and then the House in March 2010 , when it was signed into law by President Obama .\nThe plaintiff \u2019 s lawyers argue that this process violated the \u201c origination clause \u201d in Article 1 of the Constitution , which says \u201c All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills. \u201d They contend the Senate did not merely \u201c amend \u201d the original House bill because the health care reform amendment was not germane to the original bill .",
