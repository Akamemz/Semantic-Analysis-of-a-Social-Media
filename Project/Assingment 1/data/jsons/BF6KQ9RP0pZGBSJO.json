( Greg Yerex via AP )\nSEATTLE ( AP ) \u2014 Amid all the fears , quarantines and stockpiling of food , it has been easy to ignore the fact that more than 60,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus spreading around the globe .\nThe disease can cause varying degrees of illness and is especially troublesome for older adults and people with existing health problems , who are at risk of severe effects , including pneumonia . But for most of those affected , coronavirus creates only mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough , with the vast majority recovering from the virus .\nAccording to the World Health Organization , people with mild illness recover in about two weeks , while those with more severe ailments may take three to six weeks to rebound . In mainland China , where the virus first exploded , more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed , but more than 60,000 already have recovered .\nBecause the difference in impact can be so great , global health authorities have the difficult task of alerting the public to the virus \u2019 dangers without creating panic .\nAlready , the widespread consequences of the virus have been staggering , sending shock waves through the world \u2019 s financial markets . Global oil prices sustained their worst percentage losses since the the Gulf War in 1991 , and new restrictions were imposed in Italy and in Israel as the Holy Week approached .\nBut even some of the most vulnerable patients can fight their way through the disease .\nCharlie Campbell \u2019 s father , 89-year-old Eugene Campbell , has been diagnosed with the coronavirus and is hospitalized in Edmonds , Washington . Charlie Campbell said his father \u2019 s doctor is cautiously optimistic , adding , \u201c Under normal circumstances , he would discharge my dad , but these aren \u2019 t normal circumstances . \u201d\nEugene Campbell came to the hospital from Life Care Center , a nursing home in Kirkland that has been linked to a large share of the state \u2019 s coronavirus deaths .\n\u201c We went and saw him yesterday and he looked pretty good , \u201d Campbell said , noting that his father is breathing normally and his vital signs and heart rate are good . \u201c He may be the oldest person to recover from coronavirus . \u201d\nIn China , Tan Shiyun , a postgraduate student at a university in Wuhan , had traveled to her family home in Yichang over 180 miles away when she began to experience minor symptoms from the virus .\nShe went to the hospital , where she was given common cold medicine and sent home . It was only after her symptoms persisted and she visited the hospital a second time for an outpatient CT scan and received a call asking her to come back did she understand her symptoms came from something other than the common flu .\nAfter many days and a number of tests , doctors eventually told her that the infection had spread to both of her lungs .\n\u201c After that , I felt a heavy head while walking , unable to breathe , and nauseous , \u201d Tan said in a video blog post . But after over two weeks in the hospital , a CT scan showed her infection was disappearing and she was discharged .\nFor some who \u2019 ve been quarantined , anxiety and dread that they will become stigmatized by friends , neighbors and co-workers have equaled their concerns about their physical health . A few patients with the virus who were interviewed by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 all of them passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that ended up quarantined off Japan \u2014 described symptoms that were no stronger than a regular cold or flu .\nFor some who \u2019 ve been quarantined , anxiety and dread that they will become stigmatized by friends , neighbors and co-workers have made them reluctant to acknowledge even the most modest health impact .
