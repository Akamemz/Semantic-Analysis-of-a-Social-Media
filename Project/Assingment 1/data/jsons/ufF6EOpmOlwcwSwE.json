    "content": "One of Watergate \u2019 s less obvious but lasting effects was that a politician \u2019 s \u201c character \u201d \u2014a capacious term that would eventually encompass all kinds of supposed virtues and flaws\u2014became an object of increasingly obsessive scrutiny for the press and the public . This was a noticeable shift . John F. Kennedy , for instance , was famously unfaithful to his wife , and yet , as Lesley Stahl told Radiolab in 2016 , \u201c we wouldn \u2019 t have dreamed of printing that even if the whispers were loud enough to spread around the country . It just wasn \u2019 t done. \u201d Those decorous conventions collapsed in the wake of a more invasive press activated by Richard Nixon \u2019 s crimes . So , in the ensuing years , did whatever illusions the public may have had about its political leadership . Though there were many reasons for Nixon \u2019 s downfall , the Oval Office tapes that finally incriminated him beyond doubt did something else as well : They revealed the extent of the gap between the private machinations of the men who held office and their public bearing . And once the press had helped reveal that gap , it became impossible to close it up again .\nAs the tacit agreement to keep the private sins of politicians off-limits began to erode , a new political reality emerged . Its strictures\u2014as with all such upheavals\u2014were sometimes a little arbitrary . Many of the scandals were naturally about sex , and few were as much of a legal breach as the Watergate break-in and cover-up . In 1976 , Rep. Wayne Hays resigned when it was discovered he \u2019 d been keeping a young woman on his staff who turned out , despite his forceful denials , to be his mistress . The financial side of this mattered , of course , but so\u2014to a portion of the public that was coming to see the personal as political\u2014did the cheating and lying , something that used to be dismissed as mere \u201c scandal. \u201d The so-called character question only increased in importance over the next few years : Jimmy Carter won in part by contrasting his moral probity with the Nixon-Ford administration \u2019 s ( in 1979 , James Fallows would backhandedly call Carter \u201c as admirable a human being as has ever held the job \u201d ) . And in 1987\u2014charmingly called \u201c the Year of the Bimbo \u201d by the Wall Street Journal\u2014Gary Hart , the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , would be brought down after an affair was deemed ( despite his protestations that infidelity \u201c hasn \u2019 t been the business of the American public for 200 years \u201d ) not just newsworthy but disqualifying .\nIn his book All the Truth Is Out about Hart , Matt Bai suggested\u2014in a passage lamenting the rise of \u201c this violent compression of politics and celebrity and moral policing \u201d \u2014that character , as a bucket term for human flaws that reflect on a politician \u2019 s fitness , had become distressingly and even unsustainably broad .\nIt wasn \u2019 t just about sex , as it was in Hart \u2019 s case , but also about whether you uttered a line you wished you could take back or made an investment you probably shouldn \u2019 t have , about whether you \u2019 d ever gotten stoned or written something idiotic in a school paper . Nothing mattered more in a politician than his essential character , and no shred of private behavior , no moment of weakness or questionable judgment , was too insignificant to illuminate it .\nOnce a person \u2019 s private conduct was perceived to impinge on their ability to do their public work , the onus fell on the public to decide what to do about revelations of this sort\u2014in particular , whether they rendered the candidate unfit for public service . Many of us have spent decades being overexposed to the ubiquitous personal shortcomings of politicians . The idea was that we , the judicious public , deserved to know all the facts , ingest the filth , and metabolize it into a sound and democratic electoral result . But it has been a messy change . It \u2019 s not just that media organizations are neither consistent nor clear about which scandals are newsworthy ; the problem is that we , the members of that vaunted public square , have not been able to reconcile these ugly exposures with the American ideals democracy theoretically serves . And so Americans have been heading , for some time , toward something like moral burnout .\nBack in 1987 , Gary Hart felt unreasonably targeted . He wasn \u2019 t alone ; many Americans found the reporters who hid in the bushes to get the story of Hart and Donna Rice guilty of sensational overreach . On the other hand , Cokie Roberts told Radiolab that some female reporters at the time felt that Hart \u2019 s conduct was more than fair game . \u201c There were times when you \u2019 d be in a room where he \u2019 d hit on every woman in the room , \u201d she said . \u201c The way women were treated was something we thought , and I continue to think , is a good gauge of character . \u2026 We were expanding the universe of what was a major character flaw . \u201d\nThere was one other unexpected casualty of that 1987 presidential campaign dominated by the politics of character : Joseph Biden .\nBiden was forced to end his first presidential campaign after he was found to have copied parts of a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock , even appearing to claim details from Kinnock \u2019 s life story as his own . He was also found to have borrowed bits of speeches from Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey , and to have improperly footnoted an assignment in law school . It \u2019 s unlikely that these discoveries would have ended his campaign two decades earlier . The New York Times called Biden \u201c the second victim of the character issue in a contest for the White House. \u201d \u201c Whatever else it may or may not prove , the withdrawal of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. from the contest for the Democratic Presidential nomination demonstrates how much the 1988 campaign differs from its predecessors , \u201d the Times piece noted . \u201c Never before have candidates \u2019 alleged character flaws emerged so early or proved so lethal . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s possible the character issue truly peaked in 1987 ; that was also the year that Ronald Reagan \u2019 s failed nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court ( sunk with the help of Biden ) became shorthand for what were perceived as personal attacks for partisan reasons . Biden was already middle-aged\u201444 ! \u2014when he first experienced this newfangled backlash to his past failings . Many , political insiders especially , saw those failings as minor : Democrats who stayed mum about Gary Hart spoke up in Biden \u2019 s defense . Even Republicans defended him . \u201c I have never seen the Republicans as totally supportive of a person on the opposite end of the spectrum as they have been with Joe , \u201d Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum , a Democrat from Ohio , told the New York Times . Sen. Strom Thurmond said , \u201c I \u2019 ve always found him to be a high-type man. \u201d The New York Times observed that these defenses \u201c reflected Mr. Biden \u2019 s acceptance within the Senate \u2018 club , \u2019 where Mr. Hart was always considered a loner . \u201d\nR.W . Apple Jr. \u2019 s assessment of Biden \u2019 s 1987 candidacy chose an apt metaphor to describe what went wrong : \u201c In the early stages of a courtship , transgressions can be fatal , but in a well-rooted marriage , they may be quickly forgiven ; so it is in politics . Almost the first things many voters learned about Mr. Biden , aside from his good looks and articulateness , was that he had done things that most people consider a bit questionable at best. \u201d In other words , Biden may have been familiar to Washington . But the senator from Delaware wasn \u2019 t broadly popular , or an especially known quantity , in the rest of America .\nCharacter wasn \u2019 t reducible to one \u2019 s reputation . It was a more personal amalgam , and one that , in Biden \u2019 s view , deserved some measure of privacy .\nBiden is now in just such a \u201c marriage \u201d with many American voters\u2014thanks in no small part to his long tenure in the Senate and his close association with President Barack Obama . He \u2019 s a household name . But as he comes under at least as much scrutiny for his moral character as for his politics , 33 years later , we can see two things : 1 ) that Trump has badly distorted\u2014perhaps beyond recognition\u2014our ability to properly judge the issue of moral personal behavior in American politics ; and 2 ) that we can learn a lot about how Biden himself thinks about the character question by seeing how it played out when he presided over the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings .\nOne can deduce how much Biden hated the rise of \u201c character \u201d as a matter of public concern given how reluctant he seemed , a few years after losing the presidential primary on the issue , to see Thomas evaluated on the same terms . Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer write in Strange Justice that Biden was aware early on of Hill \u2019 s allegations but \u201c went out of his way to suggest that any charges of improper conduct\u2014he made no mention of Hill or her allegations , of course\u2014were not worthy of debate. \u201d Indeed , in a speech he gave explaining his choice to vote no on Thomas in committee , he made a point to say \u201c there is no question with respect to the nominee \u2019 s character , competence , credentials , or credibility. \u201d He told the committee before Hill \u2019 s allegations went public : \u201c I believe there are certain things that are not at issue at all , and that is his character . This is about what he believes , not about who he is . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s statement betrays some concern over how slippery and powerful the category of \u201c character \u201d had gotten . Character wasn \u2019 t reducible to one \u2019 s reputation , nor was it defined by one \u2019 s actions , however objectionable ; it was a more personal amalgam , and one that , in his view , deserved some measure of privacy . Biden draws an extremely curious distinction on these grounds : He posits that Thomas can and should be judged on what he believes\u2014implying that what a person believes is at least theoretically separable from who they are .\nBiden \u2019 s strenuous exclusion of character as a criterion for public office was shared by an unlikely party : Anita Hill . According to Abramson and Mayer , Hill was also unhappy that character was becoming a defining issue in American politics . Before her claims went public , she told a friend \u201c that she had been \u2018 appalled \u2019 by the treatment their old Yale professor Robert Bork had received during his abortive confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court in 1987 . She didn \u2019 t want to see another nominee ripped apart on the basis of his personal character : \u2018 Bork and Thomas should stand or fall on their ideas . \u2019 \u201d\nIt \u2019 s somewhat ironic that Biden\u2014who made a point of rejecting character-based politics in 1991\u2014has been frequently accused of transforming American political culture on those very grounds when he ran Bork \u2019 s confirmation hearing in 1987 , just as his own presidential campaign was collapsing on character-related charges . ( He withdrew from the race in the middle of the hearings . ) Borking has become a term of art for unfairly attacking a candidate through \u201c harsh public criticism or vilification. \u201d Many conservatives blame Biden , specifically , for ushering in an era dominated by the politics of personal destruction , even though the effort to turn public opinion against Bork ( which cited his conservative legal opinions but also his role presumably aiding Nixon in Watergate \u2019 s Saturday Night Massacre ) was initiated by Sen. Ted Kennedy and a combination of grassroots organizations . In actuality , Biden tried to safeguard Bork \u2019 s privacy , refusing , for example , to subpoena Bork \u2019 s video rental history . In 2008 , a former Biden intern described Biden \u2019 s commitment to the theoretical separation of private and public selves at this crucial moment in 1987 : \u201c I saw Mr. Biden struggle to focus the hearings on Judge Bork \u2019 s judicial philosophy rather than his private life , in the face of overwhelming political pressure from interest groups on the left . \u2026 He did everything in his power to resist the collapse of boundaries. \u201d Still , the hearing was one of the first to be televised and Bork himself was underprepared , which did nothing to turn the tide back in his favor . The Senate voted against the nominee by the widest margin in history .\nThis much is accurate : Biden maintained a distinction between public and private life even when it was not politically advantageous to do so . The future vice president \u2019 s reluctance to act on Hill \u2019 s account until he was forced to is well documented . So is the fact that he considered burying other ethically troubling allegations about nominees the decent thing to do\u2014to avoid besmirching their characters . Per the New York Times , \u201c On other occasions as Judiciary Committee chairman , [ Biden ] said he had been made aware of unsubstantiated reports of wrongdoings by nominees that he did not divulge in order to protect their reputations. \u201d On the whole , Biden seemed to believe that a man \u2019 s good name needed protection more than his alleged bad actions needed exposure . In a 1992 interview with E.J . Dionne in which he looked back on the confirmation hearings , he said he regretted not defending Hill and \u201c attacking the attackers , \u201d but he also made clear that he was worried less about damage to Hill \u2019 s character than to Thomas \u2019 . Conceding that he could have paused the hearings in order to investigate whether there was a \u201c pattern of behavior , \u201d Biden said that it wouldn \u2019 t have been fair\u2014to Thomas . He was worried that doing so would allow rumors about Thomas to spread .\nBiden did , however , pay lip service to the new world everyone was inhabiting . He speechified\u2014to Thomas and to his colleagues\u2014about how private misconduct intersects with public service , and how the judgment of a man accused of such a thing would go :\nWe \u2019 re big boys . I knew when I ran for president everything was free game . Anybody who runs for the Supreme Court or is appointed to the Supreme Court , to be more precise , should understand . It \u2019 s not Boy Scouts , it \u2019 s not Cub Scouts .\nBiden also clarified then that the hearing was \u201c not a referendum \u201d on whether sexual harassment was a grave offense\u2014it was\u2014but about whether it had occurred . \u201c Now , \u201d he addressed Thomas , \u201c we \u2019 re going to hear more witnesses who are going to come in and corroborate your position and hers . We \u2019 ll find out whether they \u2019 re telling the truth or not as best as we are capable of doing , just like you as a judge are when you look them in the eye and make a judgment . \u201d\nWhat emerges is a portrait of a man perceptive enough to articulate changing mores even if he privately resists them .\nAs we now know , Biden did not call three witnesses who could have spoken to whether Thomas had a pattern of sexual harassment . Angela Wright-Shannon and Sukari Hardnett were prepared to testify to Thomas \u2019 conduct and to the culture at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . So was a third woman , Rose Jourdain , who said she could back up Wright \u2019 s testimony and was prepared to do so while extremely ill .\nIn 2017 , Biden told Teen Vogue that he wanted the witnesses to testify and that they had refused . \u201c I wasn \u2019 t able to convince three women we \u2019 d subpoenaed to cooperate with testimony . At the last minute , they changed their mind and said they wouldn \u2019 t do it . I had them sign an affidavit saying , \u2018 I want you to come , and you \u2019 re saying , \u201c No , I will not come. \u201d \u2019 \u201d A letter to that effect does exist for Wright\u2014it \u2019 s in the hearing transcript and bears Wright \u2019 s signature as well as Biden \u2019 s . But Mayer and Abramson \u2019 s reporting on how that letter came to be entered into the record does not remotely match Biden \u2019 s account :\nAn aide from Biden \u2019 s office called Middlebrooks [ Wright \u2019 s attorney ] and offered to release Wright from her subpoena\u2014if she was willing to say that she had requested the cancellation . Wright \u2019 s response was typically blunt : \u2018 Bullshit . After I \u2019 ve been sitting here for three days being called names ? \u2019 Middlebrooks also refused . \u2018 You are not going to make her look like she \u2019 s cutting and running . She \u2019 s the key second witness and we want our story aired . \u2019\nBiden \u2019 s office kept negotiating ways for Wright not to testify , and Wright finally signed . As for Hardnett , she said in a 2018 interview with NPR that she had no idea why she wasn \u2019 t called .\nWhat emerges from all this , it seems to me , is a portrait of a man perceptive enough to articulate changing mores even if he privately resists them . Biden wants to be good , works very hard to look good , and squints very hard to try to make nice and good mean the same thing . But given the choice between exposing a fellow insider \u2019 s questionable conduct or withholding that information from the public he ostensibly represents , Biden protected the insider . Faced with the assassination of Anita Hill \u2019 s character ( which was happening in real time , under his watch ) and the potential assassination of Thomas \u2019 , he protected Thomas and not Hill . Biden prioritized the preservation of the insider \u2019 s reputation over the public \u2019 s right to know .\nSuch a man might plagiarize slightly from various speeches ( or in law school ) . Such a man might also massage an unfavorable story into a more flattering one . It \u2019 s he who desperately wanted Angela Wright-Shannon and Sukari Hardnett to testify , Biden maintains ; it was they who pulled out . Or perhaps , as he has also suggested , it was Hill \u2019 s preference that Wright keep quiet : \u201c Biden and several of his top staff members said that it had been Hill and her lawyers who had chiefly opposed calling Wright , \u201d Mayer and Abramson write . But Hill denied this . \u201c We were waiting for Angela Wright \u2019 s testimony , just like everyone else , \u201d Hill said . \u201c Apparently something went wrong . I was as surprised as anyone that she didn \u2019 t testify . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s stories about all this don \u2019 t quite add up . He \u2019 s not out-and-out wrong\u2014the Wright affidavit exists , and she signed it ! \u2014but the whole is sloppy and incomplete , and the omissions and errors accrue in his favor . Biden clearly sensed , even at the time , that not calling Wright might look bad . When Democratic senators decided against calling her , Biden came out and told his staff the result of a full committee vote was 13\u20131 against her testifying \u201c with himself as her sole supporter. \u201d But two other Democratic senators on the committee said they recalled no such vote . Howard Metzenbaum , a Democrat , said , \u201c I don \u2019 t think Biden was anxious to bring Angela Wright on . \u201d\nEven as Biden tacitly protected Thomas \u2019 privacy , he publicly told him \u201c you will not be unaffected by this no matter what happens . Nobody goes through the white-hot glare of this process at any level for any reason and comes out unaffected. \u201d He also chose a fascinating metaphor for how character ought to be understood : \u201c But , Judge , nobody \u2019 s reputation , nobody \u2019 s reputation , is a snapshot ; it \u2019 s a motion picture . And the picture is being made , and you \u2019 ve made a vast part of it the last 43 years . \u201d\nI have been reading up on Biden as a \u201c motion picture \u201d for obvious reasons\u2014to better understand who Biden was before he was reinvented , during Obama \u2019 s presidency , as a warm and frank \u201c Uncle Joe \u201d whose gaffes are part of his charm . This last snapshot is the muscular public image on which his well-rooted marriage to the American public is based . Looking back a few decades doesn \u2019 t just reveal a great deal more about who Biden was\u2014it illustrates how the American conversation around what we expect from public officials developed too . I understand why Biden wants to remain laser-focused only on his history since helping to pass the Violence Against Women Act . But the preceding years were crucial . They defined how the nation would and would not grapple with scandals around sex\u2014a sphere whose \u201c dirtiness \u201d had functionally created a safe space of sorts for men of all previous generations , but which was becoming contested , political , and public .\nA minor publishing scandal in 1979 illustrated how sensitive this new focus on private conduct was , and how much the idea of holding male politicians accountable was considered risky , or extreme , or unfair . Ted Kennedy was challenging Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president . Suzannah Lessard wrote a 3,000-word essay about Kennedy \u2019 s philandering called \u201c Kennedy \u2019 s Woman Problem , Women \u2019 s Kennedy Problem \u201d for the New Republic . It was controversial enough that TNR owner Marty Peretz refused to publish it , prompting editor Michael Kinsley to resign in protest ( he would later be rehired ) . The Washington Monthly picked the column up and made it the cover of its December issue .\nLessard \u2019 s point is by now familiar : She argues that character\u2014in every sphere\u2014counts . While privacy matters , Ted Kennedy \u2019 s womanizing must be considered fair game if he intends to run for president , she writes . She criticizes \u201c the fastidious gentlemen \u2019 s code that holds that the private lives of politicians should be off limits , that what counts are the serious matters , such as a man \u2019 s position on issues , and that only a very sleazy and trivial reporter would lower himself to write about that sort of dirt. \u201d She observes , too , that there \u2019 s more than a whiff of condescension underpinning this attitude about what the voting public needs to know : that if the people knew what politicians were really like , it would \u201c render them incapable of treating such information properly . They would be excessively shocked , they would overreact , and the political process would be distorted by irrelevancies . \u201d\nToday we \u2019 re all the way on the other side : overexposed to \u201c that sort of dirt \u201d about politicians and exhausted from the task of sorting through it . Has the political process been \u201c distorted by irrelevancies \u201d ? Or has this painful ongoing process of navigating the \u201c character \u201d question been , on the whole , worth it ?\nThe public \u2019 s answers to these questions have oscillated . Bill Clinton \u2019 s impeachment trial , for instance , was a Republican effort to make \u201c character \u201d sink a president , but it didn \u2019 t work out that way . Even as , according to polling , Americans became more skeptical of whether the president had \u201c high moral and ethical standards , \u201d they still supported his presidency and the roaring economy that buttressed it . Many said they didn \u2019 t care what Clinton did in his personal life provided he did his job .\nMore recently , Donald Trump has thrown a much larger wrench into these fine distinctions . And indeed , the upcoming election , between two men who have weathered\u2014even broken\u2014the character question , may mark another drastic shift in how we consider it .\nIt \u2019 s pretty clear by now that Tara Reade \u2019 s allegation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 will mean little or nothing for Biden \u2019 s presidential bid . Further reporting has cast some doubt on Reade \u2019 s credibility , but from an electoral standpoint , it \u2019 s amazing how little her allegation seemed to matter in the first place . Despite the ethical demands # MeToo made , people \u2019 s individual rulings on whether they believed Reade didn \u2019 t seem to much affect whether they would vote for Biden . Lucy Flores , who wrote an essay for the Cut last year describing the discomfort she experienced when he touched her and smelled her hair at a campaign event ; Linda Hirshman ; and many other feminists who spoke up for Reade said that if the presidency comes down to Trump and Biden , they would reluctantly , citing a principle of harm reduction , vote for the latter . \u201c I won \u2019 t say it will be easy , \u201d Hirshman wrote . \u201c I know how supposedly \u2018 liberal \u2019 men abused the sexual revolution in every imaginable way. \u201d But she would swallow her reservations and vote for Biden anyway . The neighbor who corroborated Reade \u2019 s account falls into this category too ; she \u2019 s a Biden supporter and likely to remain so . I \u2019 ve never been a Biden supporter , but if he \u2019 s the candidate , I , too , will vote for him , because the ongoing calamity in the United States must be slowed . Even Reade herself , in her recent interview with Megyn Kelly , said she understands that people who believe her will still vote for Biden . ( She also noted that he \u201c should not be running on character for the president of the United States . \u201d )\nThese statements suggest that \u201c character \u201d might have run its course as a decisive issue in American politics . There are too many tangible emergencies . There is a pandemic . Forty million Americans have filed jobless claims . More than 100,000 people who were alive three months ago are dead . Black people are being killed on video with little to no accountability while the president defends Confederate monuments and generals . Despite the dangers , the streets are wild with people \u2019 s desperation and unhappiness . In the middle of all of this , Biden is deploying one of his unique strengths\u2014his empathy , born from the many familial tragedies he \u2019 s suffered through while in politics . America is grieving right now , and Joe Biden is good at grief .\nThere are too many tangible emergencies . There is a pandemic . Forty million Americans have filed jobless claims .\nHe is also , arguably , using the character issue to reroute Americans \u2019 character concerns into institutional questions . When Biden says \u201c character is on the ballot , \u201d the line isn \u2019 t about his character as much as it is about the moral character of America . His campaign is not personality-driven . At this particular point in history , that lack of emphasis on the self may be a welcome change .\nTrump and Biden , who have both been public figures for decades , have each weathered the character question by rejecting its premises . But they \u2019 ve done so in different ways . Trump has flouted ethical prescriptions both publicly and privately . He screwed people who worked for him by not paying them , knowing they \u2019 d never be able to make him do so in court . He sued enemies until they gave up , bribed porn stars , and used Trump University to further immiserate vulnerable people who didn \u2019 t see through the fraud . He \u2019 s the ultimate expression of the American id freed of any remaining Puritan constraints , and of American capitalism freed from any regulation at all , whether legal , ethical , or social .\nBiden , by contrast , has long battled from inside the crosshairs of the character crisis , as both administrator and subject . His record is mixed ; the flaws that cost him the Democratic nomination in 1987 are still there . New issues like his handsiness have emerged . As for Reade : Much has been written about her credibility , but it \u2019 s worth reiterating that Biden \u2019 s credibility is in question too . The strange lies he repeatedly tells\u2014about being arrested en route to visiting Nelson Mandela even though he wasn \u2019 t , about marching in the civil rights movement even though he did not\u2014are as injurious as his reluctance to give them up is baffling . But on this front , as with so many , Trump has bottomed out the curve . Biden \u2019 s ethical infractions exist , but he still responds to at least a few external standards besides his naked self-interest . He wants to be considered a good and decent man by people of all political persuasions , Republicans included . This last is key . Whatever else one might say about him\u2014and I \u2019 ve said plenty\u2014he worked very hard during the Thomas hearings to be considered fair\u2014by Republicans even more than by Democrats .\nIf character were still a top-tier issue for Americans , other candidates in the Democratic primary would have fared better than they have . Biden isn \u2019 t the character candidate . He might be the decency candidate ( decency being a flattering category that forgives and overlooks much that character exacts and excludes ) . Given the current political terrain , many Americans seem to regard having ethical aspirations at all\u2014even if you don \u2019 t live up to them , even if you fudge facts in your striving toward them , even if you have at times sacrificed righteousness for reputation\u2014as enough .\nThere is an upside to this low bar . If Biden wins , his will not be a cultish victory , and some diminished passion toward the presidency might be a healthy corrective to a country whose character might be damaged beyond repair . No doubt a President Biden would see his character come under assault by the opposing party , but it \u2019 s not likely to be able to do much damage . Much of the public is exhausted , furious , and sickened by the yawning gap between American ideals and American realities . Standards have been shredded to such an extent that it \u2019 s hard to imagine a candidate dropping out over a character issue now . Maybe this is OK . The mythmaking urge to turn our leaders into idols of history\u2014whether Clinton or Reagan or Kennedy\u2014was always in tension with the ugly facts that kept emerging about them . Of course the cognitive dissonance was insupportable . Of course American idealism did not survive the ongoing public exposure of the political system that built it . But if we can start treating presidents as functionaries rather than celebrities\u2014if the reality TV president ends the celebrity presidency\u2014that will have been a good thing . And if Biden \u2019 s first presidential run was one of the first casualties of character politics , his late career ascent might mark its end .",
    "content_original": "One of Watergate\u2019s less obvious but lasting effects was that a politician\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d\u2014a capacious term that would eventually encompass all kinds of supposed virtues and flaws\u2014became an object of increasingly obsessive scrutiny for the press and the public. This was a noticeable shift. John F. Kennedy, for instance, was famously unfaithful to his wife, and yet, as Lesley Stahl told Radiolab in 2016, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of printing that even if the whispers were loud enough to spread around the country. It just wasn\u2019t done.\u201d Those decorous conventions collapsed in the wake of a more invasive press activated by Richard Nixon\u2019s crimes. So, in the ensuing years, did whatever illusions the public may have had about its political leadership. Though there were many reasons for Nixon\u2019s downfall, the Oval Office tapes that finally incriminated him beyond doubt did something else as well: They revealed the extent of the gap between the private machinations of the men who held office and their public bearing. And once the press had helped reveal that gap, it became impossible to close it up again.\n\nAs the tacit agreement to keep the private sins of politicians off-limits began to erode, a new political reality emerged. Its strictures\u2014as with all such upheavals\u2014were sometimes a little arbitrary. Many of the scandals were naturally about sex, and few were as much of a legal breach as the Watergate break-in and cover-up. In 1976, Rep. Wayne Hays resigned when it was discovered he\u2019d been keeping a young woman on his staff who turned out, despite his forceful denials, to be his mistress. The financial side of this mattered, of course, but so\u2014to a portion of the public that was coming to see the personal as political\u2014did the cheating and lying, something that used to be dismissed as mere \u201cscandal.\u201d The so-called character question only increased in importance over the next few years: Jimmy Carter won in part by contrasting his moral probity with the Nixon-Ford administration\u2019s (in 1979, James Fallows would backhandedly call Carter \u201cas admirable a human being as has ever held the job\u201d). And in 1987\u2014charmingly called \u201cthe Year of the Bimbo\u201d by the Wall Street Journal\u2014Gary Hart, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, would be brought down after an affair was deemed (despite his protestations that infidelity \u201chasn\u2019t been the business of the American public for 200 years\u201d) not just newsworthy but disqualifying.\n\nIn his book All the Truth Is Out about Hart, Matt Bai suggested\u2014in a passage lamenting the rise of \u201cthis violent compression of politics and celebrity and moral policing\u201d\u2014that character, as a bucket term for human flaws that reflect on a politician\u2019s fitness, had become distressingly and even unsustainably broad.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about sex, as it was in Hart\u2019s case, but also about whether you uttered a line you wished you could take back or made an investment you probably shouldn\u2019t have, about whether you\u2019d ever gotten stoned or written something idiotic in a school paper. Nothing mattered more in a politician than his essential character, and no shred of private behavior, no moment of weakness or questionable judgment, was too insignificant to illuminate it.\n\nOnce a person\u2019s private conduct was perceived to impinge on their ability to do their public work, the onus fell on the public to decide what to do about revelations of this sort\u2014in particular, whether they rendered the candidate unfit for public service. Many of us have spent decades being overexposed to the ubiquitous personal shortcomings of politicians. The idea was that we, the judicious public, deserved to know all the facts, ingest the filth, and metabolize it into a sound and democratic electoral result. But it has been a messy change. It\u2019s not just that media organizations are neither consistent nor clear about which scandals are newsworthy; the problem is that we, the members of that vaunted public square, have not been able to reconcile these ugly exposures with the American ideals democracy theoretically serves. And so Americans have been heading, for some time, toward something like moral burnout.\n\nBack in 1987, Gary Hart felt unreasonably targeted. He wasn\u2019t alone; many Americans found the reporters who hid in the bushes to get the story of Hart and Donna Rice guilty of sensational overreach. On the other hand, Cokie Roberts told Radiolab that some female reporters at the time felt that Hart\u2019s conduct was more than fair game. \u201cThere were times when you\u2019d be in a room where he\u2019d hit on every woman in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way women were treated was something we thought, and I continue to think, is a good gauge of character. \u2026 We were expanding the universe of what was a major character flaw.\u201d\n\nThere was one other unexpected casualty of that 1987 presidential campaign dominated by the politics of character: Joseph Biden.\n\nBiden was forced to end his first presidential campaign after he was found to have copied parts of a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock, even appearing to claim details from Kinnock\u2019s life story as his own. He was also found to have borrowed bits of speeches from Robert Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey, and to have improperly footnoted an assignment in law school. It\u2019s unlikely that these discoveries would have ended his campaign two decades earlier. The New York Times called Biden \u201cthe second victim of the character issue in a contest for the White House.\u201d \u201cWhatever else it may or may not prove, the withdrawal of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. from the contest for the Democratic Presidential nomination demonstrates how much the 1988 campaign differs from its predecessors,\u201d the Times piece noted. \u201cNever before have candidates\u2019 alleged character flaws emerged so early or proved so lethal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible the character issue truly peaked in 1987; that was also the year that Ronald Reagan\u2019s failed nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court (sunk with the help of Biden) became shorthand for what were perceived as personal attacks for partisan reasons. Biden was already middle-aged\u201444!\u2014when he first experienced this newfangled backlash to his past failings. Many, political insiders especially, saw those failings as minor: Democrats who stayed mum about Gary Hart spoke up in Biden\u2019s defense. Even Republicans defended him. \u201cI have never seen the Republicans as totally supportive of a person on the opposite end of the spectrum as they have been with Joe,\u201d Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, a Democrat from Ohio, told the New York Times. Sen. Strom Thurmond said, \u201cI\u2019ve always found him to be a high-type man.\u201d The New York Times observed that these defenses \u201creflected Mr. Biden\u2019s acceptance within the Senate \u2018club,\u2019 where Mr. Hart was always considered a loner.\u201d\n\nR.W. Apple Jr.\u2019s assessment of Biden\u2019s 1987 candidacy chose an apt metaphor to describe what went wrong: \u201cIn the early stages of a courtship, transgressions can be fatal, but in a well-rooted marriage, they may be quickly forgiven; so it is in politics. Almost the first things many voters learned about Mr. Biden, aside from his good looks and articulateness, was that he had done things that most people consider a bit questionable at best.\u201d In other words, Biden may have been familiar to Washington. But the senator from Delaware wasn\u2019t broadly popular, or an especially known quantity, in the rest of America.\n\nCharacter wasn\u2019t reducible to one\u2019s reputation. It was a more personal amalgam, and one that, in Biden\u2019s view, deserved some measure of privacy.\n\nBiden is now in just such a \u201cmarriage\u201d with many American voters\u2014thanks in no small part to his long tenure in the Senate and his close association with President Barack Obama. He\u2019s a household name. But as he comes under at least as much scrutiny for his moral character as for his politics, 33 years later, we can see two things: 1) that Trump has badly distorted\u2014perhaps beyond recognition\u2014our ability to properly judge the issue of moral personal behavior in American politics; and 2) that we can learn a lot about how Biden himself thinks about the character question by seeing how it played out when he presided over the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings.\n\nOne can deduce how much Biden hated the rise of \u201ccharacter\u201d as a matter of public concern given how reluctant he seemed, a few years after losing the presidential primary on the issue, to see Thomas evaluated on the same terms. Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer write in Strange Justice that Biden was aware early on of Hill\u2019s allegations but \u201cwent out of his way to suggest that any charges of improper conduct\u2014he made no mention of Hill or her allegations, of course\u2014were not worthy of debate.\u201d Indeed, in a speech he gave explaining his choice to vote no on Thomas in committee, he made a point to say \u201cthere is no question with respect to the nominee\u2019s character, competence, credentials, or credibility.\u201d He told the committee before Hill\u2019s allegations went public: \u201cI believe there are certain things that are not at issue at all, and that is his character. This is about what he believes, not about who he is.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s statement betrays some concern over how slippery and powerful the category of \u201ccharacter\u201d had gotten. Character wasn\u2019t reducible to one\u2019s reputation, nor was it defined by one\u2019s actions, however objectionable; it was a more personal amalgam, and one that, in his view, deserved some measure of privacy. Biden draws an extremely curious distinction on these grounds: He posits that Thomas can and should be judged on what he believes\u2014implying that what a person believes is at least theoretically separable from who they are.\n\nBiden\u2019s strenuous exclusion of character as a criterion for public office was shared by an unlikely party: Anita Hill. According to Abramson and Mayer, Hill was also unhappy that character was becoming a defining issue in American politics. Before her claims went public, she told a friend \u201cthat she had been \u2018appalled\u2019 by the treatment their old Yale professor Robert Bork had received during his abortive confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court in 1987. She didn\u2019t want to see another nominee ripped apart on the basis of his personal character: \u2018Bork and Thomas should stand or fall on their ideas.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic that Biden\u2014who made a point of rejecting character-based politics in 1991\u2014has been frequently accused of transforming American political culture on those very grounds when he ran Bork\u2019s confirmation hearing in 1987, just as his own presidential campaign was collapsing on character-related charges. (He withdrew from the race in the middle of the hearings.) Borking has become a term of art for unfairly attacking a candidate through \u201charsh public criticism or vilification.\u201d Many conservatives blame Biden, specifically, for ushering in an era dominated by the politics of personal destruction, even though the effort to turn public opinion against Bork (which cited his conservative legal opinions but also his role presumably aiding Nixon in Watergate\u2019s Saturday Night Massacre) was initiated by Sen. Ted Kennedy and a combination of grassroots organizations. In actuality, Biden tried to safeguard Bork\u2019s privacy, refusing, for example, to subpoena Bork\u2019s video rental history. In 2008, a former Biden intern described Biden\u2019s commitment to the theoretical separation of private and public selves at this crucial moment in 1987: \u201cI saw Mr. Biden struggle to focus the hearings on Judge Bork\u2019s judicial philosophy rather than his private life, in the face of overwhelming political pressure from interest groups on the left. \u2026 He did everything in his power to resist the collapse of boundaries.\u201d Still, the hearing was one of the first to be televised and Bork himself was underprepared, which did nothing to turn the tide back in his favor. The Senate voted against the nominee by the widest margin in history.\n\nThis much is accurate: Biden maintained a distinction between public and private life even when it was not politically advantageous to do so. The future vice president\u2019s reluctance to act on Hill\u2019s account until he was forced to is well documented. So is the fact that he considered burying other ethically troubling allegations about nominees the decent thing to do\u2014to avoid besmirching their characters. Per the New York Times, \u201cOn other occasions as Judiciary Committee chairman, [Biden] said he had been made aware of unsubstantiated reports of wrongdoings by nominees that he did not divulge in order to protect their reputations.\u201d On the whole, Biden seemed to believe that a man\u2019s good name needed protection more than his alleged bad actions needed exposure. In a 1992 interview with E.J. Dionne in which he looked back on the confirmation hearings, he said he regretted not defending Hill and \u201cattacking the attackers,\u201d but he also made clear that he was worried less about damage to Hill\u2019s character than to Thomas\u2019. Conceding that he could have paused the hearings in order to investigate whether there was a \u201cpattern of behavior,\u201d Biden said that it wouldn\u2019t have been fair\u2014to Thomas. He was worried that doing so would allow rumors about Thomas to spread.\n\nBiden did, however, pay lip service to the new world everyone was inhabiting. He speechified\u2014to Thomas and to his colleagues\u2014about how private misconduct intersects with public service, and how the judgment of a man accused of such a thing would go:\n\nWe\u2019re big boys. I knew when I ran for president everything was free game. Anybody who runs for the Supreme Court or is appointed to the Supreme Court, to be more precise, should understand. It\u2019s not Boy Scouts, it\u2019s not Cub Scouts.\n\nBiden also clarified then that the hearing was \u201cnot a referendum\u201d on whether sexual harassment was a grave offense\u2014it was\u2014but about whether it had occurred. \u201cNow,\u201d he addressed Thomas, \u201cwe\u2019re going to hear more witnesses who are going to come in and corroborate your position and hers. We\u2019ll find out whether they\u2019re telling the truth or not as best as we are capable of doing, just like you as a judge are when you look them in the eye and make a judgment.\u201d\n\nWhat emerges is a portrait of a man perceptive enough to articulate changing mores even if he privately resists them.\n\nAs we now know, Biden did not call three witnesses who could have spoken to whether Thomas had a pattern of sexual harassment. Angela Wright-Shannon and Sukari Hardnett were prepared to testify to Thomas\u2019 conduct and to the culture at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. So was a third woman, Rose Jourdain, who said she could back up Wright\u2019s testimony and was prepared to do so while extremely ill.\n\nIn 2017, Biden told Teen Vogue that he wanted the witnesses to testify and that they had refused. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to convince three women we\u2019d subpoenaed to cooperate with testimony. At the last minute, they changed their mind and said they wouldn\u2019t do it. I had them sign an affidavit saying, \u2018I want you to come, and you\u2019re saying, \u201cNo, I will not come.\u201d \u2019 \u201d A letter to that effect does exist for Wright\u2014it\u2019s in the hearing transcript and bears Wright\u2019s signature as well as Biden\u2019s. But Mayer and Abramson\u2019s reporting on how that letter came to be entered into the record does not remotely match Biden\u2019s account:\n\nAn aide from Biden\u2019s office called Middlebrooks [Wright\u2019s attorney] and offered to release Wright from her subpoena\u2014if she was willing to say that she had requested the cancellation. Wright\u2019s response was typically blunt: \u2018Bullshit. After I\u2019ve been sitting here for three days being called names?\u2019 Middlebrooks also refused. \u2018You are not going to make her look like she\u2019s cutting and running. She\u2019s the key second witness and we want our story aired.\u2019\n\nBiden\u2019s office kept negotiating ways for Wright not to testify, and Wright finally signed. As for Hardnett, she said in a 2018 interview with NPR that she had no idea why she wasn\u2019t called.\n\nWhat emerges from all this, it seems to me, is a portrait of a man perceptive enough to articulate changing mores even if he privately resists them. Biden wants to be good, works very hard to look good, and squints very hard to try to make nice and good mean the same thing. But given the choice between exposing a fellow insider\u2019s questionable conduct or withholding that information from the public he ostensibly represents, Biden protected the insider. Faced with the assassination of Anita Hill\u2019s character (which was happening in real time, under his watch) and the potential assassination of Thomas\u2019, he protected Thomas and not Hill. Biden prioritized the preservation of the insider\u2019s reputation over the public\u2019s right to know.\n\nSuch a man might plagiarize slightly from various speeches (or in law school). Such a man might also massage an unfavorable story into a more flattering one. It\u2019s he who desperately wanted Angela Wright-Shannon and Sukari Hardnett to testify, Biden maintains; it was they who pulled out. Or perhaps, as he has also suggested, it was Hill\u2019s preference that Wright keep quiet: \u201cBiden and several of his top staff members said that it had been Hill and her lawyers who had chiefly opposed calling Wright,\u201d Mayer and Abramson write. But Hill denied this. \u201cWe were waiting for Angela Wright\u2019s testimony, just like everyone else,\u201d Hill said. \u201cApparently something went wrong. I was as surprised as anyone that she didn\u2019t testify.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s stories about all this don\u2019t quite add up. He\u2019s not out-and-out wrong\u2014the Wright affidavit exists, and she signed it!\u2014but the whole is sloppy and incomplete, and the omissions and errors accrue in his favor. Biden clearly sensed, even at the time, that not calling Wright might look bad. When Democratic senators decided against calling her, Biden came out and told his staff the result of a full committee vote was 13\u20131 against her testifying \u201cwith himself as her sole supporter.\u201d But two other Democratic senators on the committee said they recalled no such vote. Howard Metzenbaum, a Democrat, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Biden was anxious to bring Angela Wright on.\u201d\n\nEven as Biden tacitly protected Thomas\u2019 privacy, he publicly told him \u201cyou will not be unaffected by this no matter what happens. Nobody goes through the white-hot glare of this process at any level for any reason and comes out unaffected.\u201d He also chose a fascinating metaphor for how character ought to be understood: \u201cBut, Judge, nobody\u2019s reputation, nobody\u2019s reputation, is a snapshot; it\u2019s a motion picture. And the picture is being made, and you\u2019ve made a vast part of it the last 43 years.\u201d\n\nI have been reading up on Biden as a \u201cmotion picture\u201d for obvious reasons\u2014to better understand who Biden was before he was reinvented, during Obama\u2019s presidency, as a warm and frank \u201cUncle Joe\u201d whose gaffes are part of his charm. This last snapshot is the muscular public image on which his well-rooted marriage to the American public is based. Looking back a few decades doesn\u2019t just reveal a great deal more about who Biden was\u2014it illustrates how the American conversation around what we expect from public officials developed too. I understand why Biden wants to remain laser-focused only on his history since helping to pass the Violence Against Women Act. But the preceding years were crucial. They defined how the nation would and would not grapple with scandals around sex\u2014a sphere whose \u201cdirtiness\u201d had functionally created a safe space of sorts for men of all previous generations, but which was becoming contested, political, and public.\n\nA minor publishing scandal in 1979 illustrated how sensitive this new focus on private conduct was, and how much the idea of holding male politicians accountable was considered risky, or extreme, or unfair. Ted Kennedy was challenging Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president. Suzannah Lessard wrote a 3,000-word essay about Kennedy\u2019s philandering called \u201cKennedy\u2019s Woman Problem, Women\u2019s Kennedy Problem\u201d for the New Republic. It was controversial enough that TNR owner Marty Peretz refused to publish it, prompting editor Michael Kinsley to resign in protest (he would later be rehired). The Washington Monthly picked the column up and made it the cover of its December issue.\n\nLessard\u2019s point is by now familiar: She argues that character\u2014in every sphere\u2014counts. While privacy matters, Ted Kennedy\u2019s womanizing must be considered fair game if he intends to run for president, she writes. She criticizes \u201cthe fastidious gentlemen\u2019s code that holds that the private lives of politicians should be off limits, that what counts are the serious matters, such as a man\u2019s position on issues, and that only a very sleazy and trivial reporter would lower himself to write about that sort of dirt.\u201d She observes, too, that there\u2019s more than a whiff of condescension underpinning this attitude about what the voting public needs to know: that if the people knew what politicians were really like, it would \u201crender them incapable of treating such information properly. They would be excessively shocked, they would overreact, and the political process would be distorted by irrelevancies.\u201d\n\nToday we\u2019re all the way on the other side: overexposed to \u201cthat sort of dirt\u201d about politicians and exhausted from the task of sorting through it. Has the political process been \u201cdistorted by irrelevancies\u201d? Or has this painful ongoing process of navigating the \u201ccharacter\u201d question been, on the whole, worth it?\n\nThe public\u2019s answers to these questions have oscillated. Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, for instance, was a Republican effort to make \u201ccharacter\u201d sink a president, but it didn\u2019t work out that way. Even as, according to polling, Americans became more skeptical of whether the president had \u201chigh moral and ethical standards,\u201d they still supported his presidency and the roaring economy that buttressed it. Many said they didn\u2019t care what Clinton did in his personal life provided he did his job.\n\nMore recently, Donald Trump has thrown a much larger wrench into these fine distinctions. And indeed, the upcoming election, between two men who have weathered\u2014even broken\u2014the character question, may mark another drastic shift in how we consider it.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear by now that Tara Reade\u2019s allegation that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 will mean little or nothing for Biden\u2019s presidential bid. Further reporting has cast some doubt on Reade\u2019s credibility, but from an electoral standpoint, it\u2019s amazing how little her allegation seemed to matter in the first place. Despite the ethical demands #MeToo made, people\u2019s individual rulings on whether they believed Reade didn\u2019t seem to much affect whether they would vote for Biden. Lucy Flores, who wrote an essay for the Cut last year describing the discomfort she experienced when he touched her and smelled her hair at a campaign event; Linda Hirshman; and many other feminists who spoke up for Reade said that if the presidency comes down to Trump and Biden, they would reluctantly, citing a principle of harm reduction, vote for the latter. \u201cI won\u2019t say it will be easy,\u201d Hirshman wrote. \u201cI know how supposedly \u2018liberal\u2019 men abused the sexual revolution in every imaginable way.\u201d But she would swallow her reservations and vote for Biden anyway. The neighbor who corroborated Reade\u2019s account falls into this category too; she\u2019s a Biden supporter and likely to remain so. I\u2019ve never been a Biden supporter, but if he\u2019s the candidate, I, too, will vote for him, because the ongoing calamity in the United States must be slowed. Even Reade herself, in her recent interview with Megyn Kelly, said she understands that people who believe her will still vote for Biden. (She also noted that he \u201cshould not be running on character for the president of the United States.\u201d)\n\nThese statements suggest that \u201ccharacter\u201d might have run its course as a decisive issue in American politics. There are too many tangible emergencies. There is a pandemic. Forty million Americans have filed jobless claims. More than 100,000 people who were alive three months ago are dead. Black people are being killed on video with little to no accountability while the president defends Confederate monuments and generals. Despite the dangers, the streets are wild with people\u2019s desperation and unhappiness. In the middle of all of this, Biden is deploying one of his unique strengths\u2014his empathy, born from the many familial tragedies he\u2019s suffered through while in politics. America is grieving right now, and Joe Biden is good at grief.\n\nThere are too many tangible emergencies. There is a pandemic. Forty million Americans have filed jobless claims.\n\nHe is also, arguably, using the character issue to reroute Americans\u2019 character concerns into institutional questions. When Biden says \u201ccharacter is on the ballot,\u201d the line isn\u2019t about his character as much as it is about the moral character of America. His campaign is not personality-driven. At this particular point in history, that lack of emphasis on the self may be a welcome change.\n\nTrump and Biden, who have both been public figures for decades, have each weathered the character question by rejecting its premises. But they\u2019ve done so in different ways. Trump has flouted ethical prescriptions both publicly and privately. He screwed people who worked for him by not paying them, knowing they\u2019d never be able to make him do so in court. He sued enemies until they gave up, bribed porn stars, and used Trump University to further immiserate vulnerable people who didn\u2019t see through the fraud. He\u2019s the ultimate expression of the American id freed of any remaining Puritan constraints, and of American capitalism freed from any regulation at all, whether legal, ethical, or social.\n\nBiden, by contrast, has long battled from inside the crosshairs of the character crisis, as both administrator and subject. His record is mixed; the flaws that cost him the Democratic nomination in 1987 are still there. New issues like his handsiness have emerged. As for Reade: Much has been written about her credibility, but it\u2019s worth reiterating that Biden\u2019s credibility is in question too. The strange lies he repeatedly tells\u2014about being arrested en route to visiting Nelson Mandela even though he wasn\u2019t, about marching in the civil rights movement even though he did not\u2014are as injurious as his reluctance to give them up is baffling. But on this front, as with so many, Trump has bottomed out the curve. Biden\u2019s ethical infractions exist, but he still responds to at least a few external standards besides his naked self-interest. He wants to be considered a good and decent man by people of all political persuasions, Republicans included. This last is key. Whatever else one might say about him\u2014and I\u2019ve said plenty\u2014he worked very hard during the Thomas hearings to be considered fair\u2014by Republicans even more than by Democrats.\n\nIf character were still a top-tier issue for Americans, other candidates in the Democratic primary would have fared better than they have. Biden isn\u2019t the character candidate. He might be the decency candidate (decency being a flattering category that forgives and overlooks much that character exacts and excludes). Given the current political terrain, many Americans seem to regard having ethical aspirations at all\u2014even if you don\u2019t live up to them, even if you fudge facts in your striving toward them, even if you have at times sacrificed righteousness for reputation\u2014as enough.\n\nThere is an upside to this low bar. If Biden wins, his will not be a cultish victory, and some diminished passion toward the presidency might be a healthy corrective to a country whose character might be damaged beyond repair. No doubt a President Biden would see his character come under assault by the opposing party, but it\u2019s not likely to be able to do much damage. Much of the public is exhausted, furious, and sickened by the yawning gap between American ideals and American realities. Standards have been shredded to such an extent that it\u2019s hard to imagine a candidate dropping out over a character issue now. Maybe this is OK. The mythmaking urge to turn our leaders into idols of history\u2014whether Clinton or Reagan or Kennedy\u2014was always in tension with the ugly facts that kept emerging about them. Of course the cognitive dissonance was insupportable. Of course American idealism did not survive the ongoing public exposure of the political system that built it. But if we can start treating presidents as functionaries rather than celebrities\u2014if the reality TV president ends the celebrity presidency\u2014that will have been a good thing. And if Biden\u2019s first presidential run was one of the first casualties of character politics, his late career ascent might mark its end.",
