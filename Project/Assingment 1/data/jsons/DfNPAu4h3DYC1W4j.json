Such small flyers aren \u2019 t likely to share airspace with manned flights .\n\u201c We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules , \u201d Michael Huerta , administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration , said in a statement . \u201c We want to maintain today \u2019 s outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry. \u201d On a conference call with reporters , Huerta bragged the FAA had created \u201c the most flexible regime for unmanned aircraft 55 pounds or less that exists anywhere in the world . \u201d\nThe proposal is largely favorable to the thousands of businesses who want to use drones for photography , agriculture or inspection purposes . While there was discussion of requiring licensed drone pilots to have time flying in a manned aircraft \u2014 a potentially expensive proposition \u2014 pilots will instead have to pass a written test at an aviation training center . The FAA rejected the idea of offering the tests online , as is done in some other countries .\nThe Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International applauded the FAA for issuing the long-delayed rule , while remaining cautious about its impact .\n\u201c This proposed rule is a critical milestone in the UAS integration process , and one that is long overdue , \u201d AUVSI President Brian Wynne said . \u201c UAS technology has largely remained grounded while many prospective users wait for the regulatory framework to catch up .
