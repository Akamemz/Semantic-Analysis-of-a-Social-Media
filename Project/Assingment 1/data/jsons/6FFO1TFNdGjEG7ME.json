It \u2019 s the basis for who we are . \u201d\nAn undercount of that size could mean that a half-dozen states , including California , Texas , and Florida , would lose congressional seats and Electoral College votes . Also , it would jeopardize hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding to states for services such as health care and infrastructure . Polls , surveys , and decisions by businesses would also be affected , and the consequences would be felt for a decade , if not longer .\nResearch by the Census Bureau found that the question would decrease responses from noncitizen households by at least 5.8 % , leading to an undercount of approximately 6.5 million people \u2013 about the population of Tennessee .\nOn Tuesday , the Supreme Court heard what is likely to be one of the biggest decisions of a relatively quiet term . The case hinges on whether a question last asked in 1950 should be included on the next census : \u201c Is this person a citizen of the United States ? \u201d\nThat is the question at the heart of several others the U.S. Supreme Court asked Tuesday in a case concerning whether it is lawful for the Department of Commerce to include a question on citizenship in the 2020 census .\nIn an expanded 80-minute-long argument , the justices probed a technically complex and detailed case that could have broad and long-reaching consequences for millions of people around the country . While the core issues in the case concern the next census specifically , and the purpose of a once-a-decade census generally , the issues the justices took most interest in today examined how much deference courts should give executive agencies and their presumed expertise in areas like census-taking .\nSeveral members of the high court , across the ideological spectrum , have expressed an interest in curbing the power of administrative agencies . In the argument this morning , however , the court \u2019 s five conservative justices sounded more accepting of the government \u2019 s argument that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross didn \u2019 t overstep his authority in seeking to reinstate a citizenship question .\nA dense , and unusual , factual record from the lower court caused some disagreement among the justices , however , in addition to the debate over whether Secretary Ross violated the authorities given him by Congress .\n\u201c A secretary can deviate from his experts \u2019 recommendations and his experts \u2019 bottom line conclusions , \u201d said Justice Elena Kagan . \u201c But the Secretary needs reasons to do that , and I searched the record and I don \u2019 t see any reason . \u201d\nThe high court \u2019 s decision is likely to be one of the biggest of a relatively quiet term . Were the 2020 census to include a citizenship question , research by the Census Bureau found that the question would decrease responses from noncitizen households by at least 5.8 % , leading to an undercount of approximately 6.5 million people \u2013 about the population of Tennessee .\nAn undercount of that size could mean that a half-dozen states , including California , Texas , and Florida , would lose congressional seats and Electoral College votes . Also , it could jeopardize hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding to states for services that are used by all , such as health care and infrastructure . Polls , surveys , and decisions by businesses would also be affected , and since it would alter the census results , the consequences would be felt for a decade , if not longer .\n\u201c This is not just inside-the-Beltway business , \u201d says Justin Levitt , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles . \u201c It \u2019 s the basis for [ political ] representation , and it \u2019 s become the basis for our informational infrastructure . It \u2019 s the basis for who we are . \u201d\nThe U.S. Census Bureau , a nonpartisan agency , has not asked the question on the census since 1950 ( though it has asked a small subset of the population in the annual American Community Survey ) . But Secretary Ross indicated he was reinstating it after the Department of Justice said it needed \u201c a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population \u201d to better enforce the Voting Rights Act . Several states and nonprofit groups filed lawsuits challenging the move .\nWhat followed was a legal fight over what information the Commerce Department had to turn over in court , followed by a trial . In mid-January , a federal judge in New York ruled that Mr. Ross had violated the Administrative Procedure Act by using a dubious excuse \u2013 the DOJ voting rights request \u2013 for reinstating the question . In early March , a federal judge in California ruled that a citizenship question was unconstitutional , and a federal judge in Maryland ruled the same in early April .\nWith the 2020 census form needing to be finalized by late June , the high court took the rare step of agreeing to hear it before an appeals court did .\nHow the justices choose to interpret what the district court learned will be significant , and different interpretations became apparent almost immediately during today \u2019 s oral argument .\nWhen U.S . Solicitor General Noel Francisco , arguing for the Commerce Department , opened by saying that a citizenship question had been asked on the census \u201c for nearly 200 years , \u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor immediately cut him off .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sorry , it has not been a part of the survey since 1950 , \u201d she said . \u201c And for 65 years , every Secretary of the Department of Commerce , every statistician , including this Secretary \u2019 s statistician , recommended against asking the question . \u201d\nSeveral questions on demographics were taken off the census around that time , Solicitor General Francisco said , but were asked on other Census Bureau surveys . A citizenship question has been asked on the American Community Survey , an annual survey sent to a subset of the population , since 2005 .\nThus , he said , Mr. Ross \u201c reasonably chose \u201d by reinstating a citizenship question to the census .\nSeveral justices sounded skeptical , referencing the Census Bureau estimate of non-response rates if a citizenship question is included . Mr. Ross \u201c is told by the Census Bureau in three studies that if you ask this question on the regular form , you will get back fewer answers , \u201d said Justice Stephen Breyer .\nJustice Sotomayor referenced emails revealed in the lower court that showed how , prior to the DOJ requesting a citizenship question , the Commerce Department approached the DOJ about coming up with a reason for asking it . The DOJ said to ask the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , who in turn said it should talk with the DOJ , according to the emails .\n\u201c If the Department of Justice refused to listen to that , how can the Secretary conclude he \u2019 s complying with \u201d the Census Act , added Justice Sotomayor . \u201c This is a solution in search of a problem . \u201d\nSolicitor General Francisco expressed a different view of the lower court record . \u201c There \u2019 s no evidence in this record , \u201d he said , \u201c that the Secretary would have asked had the Department of Justice not requested it . \u201d\nWhen Barbara Underwood , the solicitor general for the state of New York , presented her argument for why reinstating the question violated federal law , Chief Justice John Roberts was the first to jump in . Wouldn \u2019 t a citizenship question help with enforcing the Voting Rights Act ?\nNo , replied Solicitor General Underwood , since the Census Bureau had said that , due to the likely effect on response rates , a citizenship question would provide less accurate data .\n`` The Census Bureau says , \u2018 We 're going to create a model ... trust us , \u2019 \u201d said Justice Samuel Alito . \u201c Is it arbitrary and capricious \u201d \u2013 a standard at which Mr. Ross would be breaking the law \u2013 \u201c for the secretary to say , \u2018 I \u2019 ll go with [ the question ] \u2019 ? \u201d\nBoth Justices Roberts and Alito ruled in favor of striking down part of the Voting Rights Act in the Shelby v. Holder decision , so \u201c it is ironic \u201d that they \u201c are now eager for its enforcement , \u201d Jennifer Nou , an administrative law professor at the University of Chicago Law School , said in an email . \u201c It is also worth noting that the Trump Administration has thus far brought exactly zero Section 2 Voting Rights Act cases thus far \u2013 further suggesting pretext . \u201d\nBoth Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh echoed Solicitor General Francisco \u2019 s point that many other countries , including Germany and Australia , ask about citizenship in their census . The United Nations also recommends countries ask about citizenship on their census , Justice Kavanaugh said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s certainly useful information for a country to have , \u201d replied Solicitor General Underwood . \u201c The question is whether it should be collected on [ the survey ] whose principal function is to count the population , when we have such strong evidence that it will depress that count . \u201d\nThere were only a few occasions when the constitutionality of reinstating a citizenship question surfaced . The sixth sentence of the founding document charges the federal government shall make an \u201c actual enumeration \u201d of people in the country every 10 years . It is the first job the Constitution gives the government , before taxation , war powers , and making laws .\nThe high court prefers to avoid rulings on constitutional grounds when it can . Plus the lower court decision at question in this case found that the Commerce Department hadn \u2019 t violated the Constitution . Still Professor Nou says she is \u201c surprised at how little attention the constitutional argument received . \u201d\n\u201c The Court certainly seemed divided along partisan lines , suggesting a 5-4 decision in favor of allowing a citizenship question on the census , \u201d she adds , impacting elections for the next decade .\n\u201c When the executive branch makes a decision with electoral consequences , it \u2019 s a good idea for courts to serve as a stronger check , \u201d she continues . \u201c If the Supreme Court fails to do so here , it will continue to be perceived as a partisan body . \u201d",
