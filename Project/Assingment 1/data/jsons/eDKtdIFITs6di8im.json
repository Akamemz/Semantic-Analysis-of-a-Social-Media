Forty-two percent say they see the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts governor in a negative light .\nWhile rising 14 points since February , Romney still trails the president , who currently has a 56 % favorable rating , with 42 % saying they hold an unfavorable opinion of Obama . The president 's favorable and unfavorable ratings are unchanged from CNN polls in March and April .\n\u201c The biggest gap between Obama and Romney 's favorable ratings is among younger Americans . More than two-thirds of those under 30 have a favorable view of Obama , compared to only four-in-ten who feel that way about Romney . Romney is much stronger among senior citizens , but the gap is not nearly as big , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` Romney may have a small advantage among independent voters , but that is offset by his lower favorable rating among Republicans than Obama has among Democrats .
