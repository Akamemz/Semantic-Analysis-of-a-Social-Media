Senate fails to save PATRIOT Act Key provisions have expired \u2013 at least for a few days .\nKey parts of the PATRIOT Act expired at midnight after a bitterly divided Senate adjourned after failing to reach agreement during a rare Sunday session to extend the anti-terrorism law .\nThe Senate did vote overwhelmingly to advance the USA Freedom Act , a House-passed surveillance reform bill that GOP leaders opposed but were forced to accept given the lack of time and other alternatives . But Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) refused to allow that measure to be adopted in time to replace the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions .\nThe USA Freedom Act easily cleared a filibuster in a 77-17 vote that appeared to set the stage for eventual passage . But it was not the outcome envisioned by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell : He had hoped to pass a temporary extension of current law to avoid a midnight shutdown of three PATRIOT Act programs , including the controversial \u201c bulk data \u201d phone record collection program .\nBut Paul wouldn \u2019 t relent , so those initiatives have at least temporarily lapsed , a troubling development for Senate Republicans in just their fifth month in the majority .\n\u201c All of us are extremely concerned about the program going dark at a time when the terrorist threat is very high , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) .\nThe Senate will vote next to end debate Tuesday on the House bill and on amendments intended to make it more palatable to Senate hawks . Those will likely extend a transition period to the new bill beyond six months and require additional certifications to the reformed data collection program .\nUntil then , three surveillance authorities will be nullified . And the House will still have to reconcile with the Senate over any changes later this week .\nMcConnell has already submitted a set of amendments to the measure . One relatively uncontroversial proposal , submitted with Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , would require telecommunications companies to notify the government if they plan to hold onto call records for less than 18 months . Another would to require the director of national intelligence to certify that the new process for obtaining business records effectively protects national security .\nBut other amendments may face significant resistance in the Senate and House , including a provision that would give the NSA six more months to wind down its bulk phone records collection program , and another that would gut the bill \u2019 s effort to make public any significant opinions from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .\nAll four are slated to get a vote after the Senate votes to end debate Tuesday , leaving the bill for now on the doorstep of success but not a done deal , even as Washington clamors for a swift resolution .\n\u201c We call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as short-lived as possible , \u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest . \u201c Individual senators must put aside their partisan motivations and act swiftly . \u201d\nPaul seemed unconcerned : Through his presidential campaign , he said his successful , if temporary , victory \u201c will not relinquish functions necessary for protecting national security . \u201d\nA visibly angry McConnell made a last-ditch attempt to keep the expiring provisions on life support on Sunday evening . He moved to extend for two weeks less controversial wire-tapping and \u201c lone wolf \u201d terrorist provisions , only to be rebuffed by his Kentucky colleague . Responding on the Senate floor , McConnell ripped what he called \u201c demagoguery \u201d surrounding the PATRIOT Act debate .\nThough McConnell had pressed Republicans to oppose the House bill earlier last month , he said the alternative \u2014 letting the PATRIOT Act provisions expire \u2014 \u201c would mean disarming completely and arbitrarily , based on a campaign of disinformation . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s a totally unacceptable outcome . We won \u2019 t be doing that , \u201d McConnell said , staring at Paul at times during the stern speech , which was interrupted by Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts \u2019 \u201c Frozen \u201d phone ringtone . \u201c We \u2019 re left with Option 2 , the House-passed bill . It \u2019 s not ideal but , along with votes on some modest amendments that attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised , it \u2019 s now the only realistic way forward . \u201d\nAfter the vote , Paul took to the floor to criticize the House bill , which would extend the PATRIOT Act but make major changes to bulk data programs exposed by Edward Snowden . Paul acknowledged that the bill will eventually pass despite his opposition even as he asserted that \u201c the PATRIOT Act will expire tonight . \u201d\n\u201c It concerns me that the president [ who ] supports bulk data collection and has been performing it illegally for six years is supporting this bill , \u201d Paul said . \u201c It \u2019 s hard for me to have trust in the people we are giving great power to . \u201d\nMcConnell laid out out his strategy during a closed-door Republican meeting on Sunday afternoon . He indicated he would try to fix what he believes are problems with the House bill , which would make telecom companies responsible for bulk data collection .\nPaul was not present at the party meeting , and it was clear his colleagues were tiring of the presidential candidate \u2019 s campaign against swift passage of any surveillance legislation . Before he objected to McConnell \u2019 s last-ditch effort , Paul was shouted down by his fellow Republicans as he attempted to give another speech against government surveillance .\nAnd McConnell lashed the \u201c determined opposition from those who simply wish to end this counterterrorism program altogether \u201d \u2014 a clear reference to Paul , the leader of that opposition .\n\u201c It \u2019 s worrying for our country . Because the nature of the threat we face is serious , it \u2019 s aggressive , it \u2019 s sophisticated , it \u2019 s geographically dispersed , and it \u2019 s not going away , \u201d McConnell said .\nSources said the USA Freedom Act , with or without amendments , could be approved as early as Tuesday or Wednesday even if Paul continues his fight . But McConnell had vowed not to let the programs lapse , hoping that the June 1 deadline would pressure the Senate to act as he pushed trade legislation through the Senate first .\nIn reaction to McConnell \u2019 s quandary , Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) blasted his successor \u2019 s leadership of the Senate , including his decision to wait to take up the PATRIOT Act until just before its key provisions were set to expire .\n\u201c The job of the leader is to have a plan . In this case , it is clear the majority leader simply didn \u2019 t have a plan , \u201d Reid said on the Senate floor . \u201c The majority leader , though , had five months during the time he \u2019 s been majority leader to coordinate with the House , which passed ( surveillance ) reform weeks ago , but instead he went it alone . In fact , it appears as if the House and the Senate Republican leaders are on completely different pages . \u201d\nIndeed , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , who shepherded a surveillance reform bill through the House by an overwhelming margin earlier this month , urged McConnell to take up the USA Freedom Act on Sunday night .\nBurr , the Intelligence Committee chairman and an ally of McConnell , predicted the House bill would pass but \u201c not in its current form . \u201d\nTempers flared as the debate unfolded . Senators were called back to Washington early from their Memorial Day vacation to address the issue , and most of their ire was directed at Paul .\n\u201c The way we work in the Senate , at least we used to , is we have compromises . And compromises may have to be made , \u201d said Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) of McConnell \u2019 s change of position on the House bill . \u201c That is not Sen. Paul \u2019 s M.O . \u201d\nPaul has been asking McConnell to allow him to have two votes on his privacy amendments , including one that would kill bulk data collection altogether , at simple majority thresholds rather than at a 60-vote threshold . It \u2019 s a demand most senators will not agree to . Reid said Democrats \u201c would agree to take \u201d up the amendments Paul had demanded before the Memorial Day recess , assuming they are \u201c limited to two. \u201d Reid said he and Paul did not discuss Paul \u2019 s demands that they be considered on a 51-vote threshold .\nBut it appeared that Republicans were more focused on amending the House-passed bill than trying to placate Paul at this point . They are concerned that the phone companies will shirk the bulk data collection program prescribed by the bill and want a longer transition period to the new setup than the six-month period that the House bill affords .\n\u201c There \u2019 ll be some amendments to strengthen the House bill and hopefully we \u2019 ll get that passed before the week \u2019 s out , \u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) . The amendments , he added , \u201c make a lot of sense . \u201d\nThe Obama administration has warned repeatedly of serious national security risks if the PATRIOT Act provisions expired .
