    "content": "Des Moines , Iowa ( CNN ) Sen. Rand Paul embraced his libertarian roots in Iowa this weekend , speaking unapologetically about his apprehension about foreign intervention and stoking the fire in one of the libertarian movement 's biggest crusades : auditing the Federal Reserve .\nIn his first trip to Iowa this year , just under a year before the caucuses , the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate ventured into familiar territory , rallying young voters and libertarian-minded supporters who turned out big for his father 's presidential campaigns .\nPaul found friendly audiences at the end of a stormy week filled with negative headlines over comments he made about vaccinations and swirling controversy involving one of his advisers in Iowa .\nThe crowds this weekend were a marked contrast to the social conservative audience that packed a Des Moines theater two weeks ago to hear 10 hours of speeches from a hoard of other potential candidates at the Iowa Freedom Summit .\nThe Federal Reserve was hardly mentioned at that event , and the rhetoric on war and the fight against ISIS was more forceful and hawkish that the positions Paul took this weekend .\nLast fall , the senator struggled to communicate his stance on the war against terror . At first he urged restraint against ISIS , but after American journalists were beheaded by the group , Paul began supporting limited action .\nHe eventually , in a committee vote , voted `` no '' to authorizing war against ISIS , saying he felt the bill was too open-ended , and it was a vote he stood proudly by this weekend as he used it to separate himself from his potential competitors .\n`` You 're going to get a choice on who the nominee is for the Republican Party . You 're going to have nine , 10 , 15 , 20 who are eager to go and want troops on the ground , '' he said at the `` Audit the Fed '' rally Friday , which took place at a winery in Des Moines . `` They want 100,000 troops on the ground . Right now . In all the countries . ''\n`` I can tell you there will be one loud voice in our party saying , think of the unintended consequence . Think about what we 're going to accomplish and whether it will work before we go to war . ' I promise you that will always be something I take very , very seriously .

''\nThat should be left to regional fighters , he said , before launching into a fiery diatribe . `` And do n't get me started about Saudi Arabia . There need to be 20,000 Saudi Arabians fighting that war because they 've been a problem . ''\nWith so many Republican candidates likely to echo each other 's talking points in the next year , Paul has tried to run in his own lane by shaping his libertarian foundation into a selling point that says he 's best poised to expand the Republican base .\nTo stop the `` dismantling of the country , '' Paul said it 's going to take someone with a nontraditional approach .\n`` It 's not going to take a ho-hum , same-old , same-old , we'll-get-a-Republican-that's-a-little-bit-different-than-the-Democrats .
