He began throwing `` incendiary devices '' at vehicles , lighting one car on fire , and attempting to burn buildings and a propane tank , according to Tacoma police .\nIn a Facebook post , his daughter , Ariel Van Spronsen , said she believes that he blew up his own car , her old `` 2002 VW GTI , which I had loaned to him . ''\nResponding officers opened fire , killing the 69-year-old . The Pierce County medical examiner 's office said Monday that Van Spronsen died of multiple gunshot wounds . The four officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave as the investigation continues , the department said .\nLast year , Van Spronsen was one of 10 people arrested at a protest outside the detention center , the New Tribune reported . According to the newspaper , Van Spronsen was accused of jumping on a police officer as the officer was attempting to detain a 17-year-old ; Van Spronsen later pleaded guilty to obstructing police .\nThat 17-year-old , who is now 18 and a lead organizer with Seattle Antifascist Action , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Van Spronsen was active in a number of far-left communities in Seattle , but `` no one saw this coming from him '' because he was `` soft powered . ''\nThe teen asked that his full name not be used , for privacy reasons .\nBefore attacking the facility , Van Spronsen sent a letter to friends that he titled a `` written manifesto , '' which detailed his motivation to `` take action against the forces of evil , '' specifically fascism and `` concentration camps . ''\nOne woman , Deb Bartley , who had known Van Spronsen for 20 years , told the Seattle Times that she believed the act `` was a suicide . ''\nThe three-page declaration outlined his `` unshakable abhorrence of injustice , '' which , he wrote , `` is what brings me here . ''\nVan Spronsen described growing up in postwar Holland and France , promising to never be one who `` stands by as neighbors are torn from their homes and imprisoned for somehow being perceived as lesser . ''\n`` I am antifa , '' he wrote , though later adding that he was not affiliated with any organization . Van Spronsen described the `` semi automatic weapon '' he used in the attack as a `` cheap , home built , unregistered 'ghost ' ar15 '' with six magazines .\nVan Spronsen was active in several radical left and `` softer left '' movements in the Seattle area , said the antifa organizer . Van Spronsen was a member of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club , which describes itself as a community-led defense group , and Occupy Portage , a faction of the Occupy movement . In a 2012 blog , the activist discussed how the group could successfully take over the island off Seattle .\n`` That group meant a lot to him ; that was his thing , '' the teen said . `` He was there last year protesting the detention center as part of that group . ''\nAfter hearing of the Trump administration 's threat of mass raids and deportations , Van Spronsen decided to target a fleet of buses that transport immigrants .\n`` The vehicles outside the detention facility are used to forcibly remove people from their homes and deport them , often to situations where they will face severe danger or death . Those vehicles being destroyed is only a start of what is needed , '' the Puget Sound Anarchists said in a post , calling Van Spronsen `` a long-time anarchist , anti-fascist and a kind , loving person . ''\nIt 's Going Down , another anarchist group , said Van Spronsen was taking action `` to disable the fleet of buses that serve the Northwest Detention Center . His action occurred on the one-year anniversary of a hunger strike inside the Northwest Detention Center and an encampment outside . ''\nAlthough Van Spronsen often `` had guns on him , '' the antifa organizer said that he was not a violent person , but someone who `` wanted to spark effective mass action . ''\n`` I think it was a combination of his age and the weekend he did it was when all those raids were going to take place , and there 's a correlation there , '' the 18-year-old said . `` I think this is something that he had thought about for a long time and he finally decided , Well , if there ever was a time , it 's now . He did what he did because he saw violence . His goal was not to hurt anyone in that facility .
