He cites the similarities : `` Young , unknown president is elected after an unpopular administration \u2014 Nixon/Ford , Bush \u2014 economy in the doldrums , problems with Iran , sense of malaise . Republicans nominate the person who finished second place in the previous nomination \u2014 Reagan to Ford in 1976 , Romney to McCain in 2008 \u2014 after a divisive nomination struggle .

''\nBack in 1980 , Smith says , Carter went `` very negative against Reagan ... because he could not claim success with the economy , and Obama looks to do the same thing this year .

''\nObviously , he says , some things are different : The Democrat is in the White House and the Republican is the challenger , and the economy is the major concern of voters this year instead of the war in Iraq . `` But there are some striking similarities , '' he says . `` And the result is again likely to be a close election in which the outcome will come down to a few swing states .
