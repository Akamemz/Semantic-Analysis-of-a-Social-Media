Cory Booker win the White House with exhortations to love one another , especially as the nation heads into a divisive impeachment inquiry ?\nThe first time New Hampshire state Sen. Martha Hennessey heard Sen. Cory Booker speak , he reminded her of a Baptist preacher . \u201c He was so \u2018 love and hope , \u2019 \u201d she says . \u201c Frankly , I was almost in tears . \u201d\nAt the same time , she thought to herself , I \u2019 m not sure America is going to like this .

But while she enjoyed the visit , the New Hampshire Democrat \u2013 who \u2019 d been hoping to endorse a female nominee \u2013 wasn \u2019 t ready to commit .\nIn this season of political courtship , many voters so far seem to see Senator Booker as \u201c friend \u201d material . \u201c He \u2019 s not the one that they have a romantic interest in , \u201d says Patrick Murray , director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey , who has been following the senator since he first ran for mayor of Newark in 2002 . The latest Monmouth poll shows Senator Booker in a five-way tie for 8th place among Democratic candidates , with 1 % of the vote .\nMany Democrats are furious with President Donald Trump , and looking for a fighter to lead them ; one voter even asked the athletic New Jersey senator to punch the president in the face . But Senator Booker is trying to convince them to take a different approach .

The experience , he says , made him understand the impulse to hate or the desire to lash out . \u201c But what I also realized was that in the times where the most challenging , hurtful , painful things come forward , you actually see the greatest of human spirit , the greatest of human potential . I saw people who were able to ignite the best in others . And that \u2019 s the model of leadership that I think we need at this time in America . \u201d\nWhile Cory Booker may talk about love , he harbors no illusions about the ugly realities of life \u2013 or politics . He knows what it \u2019 s like to have a dirty diaper thrown at him as when , as city councilman , he was leading a 10-day hunger strike to protest inadequate policing of drug dealers .

Four years later , he came back to win by the largest margin in Newark \u2019 s history . As mayor , he teamed up with Republican Gov . Chris Christie to secure a $ 100 million investment from Facebook \u2019 s Mark Zuckerberg in the city \u2019 s schools , and raised $ 300 million more through other philanthropic efforts .\nAs much as he did to champion Newark , some saw his ambitions \u2013 for the city and himself \u2013 as eclipsing the less-glamorous parts of the job .\n\u201c It \u2019 s great to paint a house , but he didn \u2019 t care at all about the plumbing and the electric , \u201d says a Democratic operative in New Jersey . \u201c But honestly before him , nobody cared about anything in Newark . \u201d\nThe city has continued to attract development since Senator Booker left for Capitol Hill in 2013 , but it has also become engulfed in a lead water crisis due to corroding pipes . The Booker campaign has vociferously denied that he bears any responsibility , noting that city water tests two years after he left still bore no signs of elevated lead levels .\nIn his book , \u201c United , \u201d Senator Booker admits he too often tried to solve things personally . He famously went into a burning building to rescue a woman , and shoveled residents \u2019 driveways during a blizzard .

But whether he was moved by ambition , genuine care , or both , he has lived the problems of inner city America in a way that few presidential candidates have .\n\u201c There are a lot of places Cory Booker could have gone to be more powerful , \u201d says Herb Jackson , a veteran New Jersey political reporter who covered his Senate campaigns . \u201c He is motivated by these things , I think sincerely . \u201d\nNow , in what Senator Booker calls \u201c a moral moment \u201d for the country , he is highlighting that experience in an effort to persuade voters that he knows best how to unite the country around shared ideals .\n\u201c I am here right now because a white guy on a couch , at a time of moral trial in our nation , did not just sit there , \u201d he tells a crowd in Bedford , New Hampshire , on a late September morning . \u201c He did not even know that I would one day exist , but he stood up for the ideals of America . And why am I running for president ? Because they \u2019 re in peril . Our dream is in trouble . \u201d\nOver the plinking of forks at Politics & Eggs , a staple on the New Hampshire campaign circuit , Senator Booker preaches his civic gospel .\nIn thundering tones , he transports the crowd from the colonial charm of the Bedford Village Inn to a memorial in Memphis , Tennessee , erected at the assassination site of Martin Luther King Jr .\nElise Amendola/AP Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
