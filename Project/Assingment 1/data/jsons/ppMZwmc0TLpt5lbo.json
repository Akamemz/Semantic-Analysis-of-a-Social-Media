    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump is shifting his story about the Stormy Daniels controversy following the revelation by his lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , that the President reimbursed a payment to the adult film actress by Michael Cohen .\nTrump -- who previously said he was not aware of the $ 130,000 Cohen paid to Daniels before the 2016 election in an effort to keep her quiet about an alleged affair between her and the President -- denied on Thursday that any campaign money was used to reimburse Cohen and said he was paid via retainer . The payment has prompted complaints to the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission over potential violations of campaign finance law .\n`` Mr. Cohen , an attorney , received a monthly retainer , not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign , from which he entered into , through reimbursement , a private contract between two parties , known as a non-disclosure agreement , or NDA , '' Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday morning .\n`` These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth , '' Trump continued . `` In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford ( Daniels ) . The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. ``\nHe added , `` Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney , this was a private agreement . Money from the campaign , or campaign contributions , played no roll in this transaction .

''\nToobin also said the penalty for violating campaign finance laws `` depends on the level of intent . Most FEC , Federal Election Commission , violations are handled civilly .

He suggested that there would be a violation of campaign finance laws if Trump and Cohen structured the payment `` in a way to avoid detection or in an effort to make it appear to be something that it was not , namely , a retainer payment as opposed to $ 130,000 reimbursement , that may involve money laundering depending on how it was handled . ''\n`` There also may be tax issues relating to the deductibility of those expenses , '' he continued . `` If they were deducted as legal expenses for tax purposes when in reality it had nothing to do with legal services rendered but instead was the reimbursement of the $ 130,000 , that , too , is going to be a problem . ''\nIn an interview on CNN 's `` The Lead with Jake Tapper , '' Avenatti said he believed Giuliani was trying to get in front of the information inevitably coming out .\n`` I absolutely believe that , '' Avenatti said . `` I believe that this was an attempt by Giuliani to hang a lantern on this and to disclose it on terms that he believed to be friendly to the President and friendly to him . ''\nBut Bradley Smith , a former FEC chairman , told CNN that he does n't believe the payment constitutes a campaign finance violation .\n`` I do n't think it matters whether Trump paid Cohen back or not , '' Smith said , adding , `` The standard is not : If it 's related to the campaign , it 's a campaign expenditure . The standard is : It 's a campaign expenditure if it is an obligation that would not exist were it not for the campaign .
