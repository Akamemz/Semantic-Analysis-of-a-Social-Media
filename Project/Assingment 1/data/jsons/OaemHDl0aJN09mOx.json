I 'm only speaking for myself . ''\nThe Trump versus Pelosi show is turning into an intriguing daily political game . But the consequences are hardly trivial : After the 2020 election it 's likely that only one of the rivals will be left standing .\nIn his second eruption against Pelosi in as many days on Thursday , Trump showed just how much she 's got under his skin .\nHe called the highest-ranking woman in the history of American politics `` a mess '' and `` crazy .
