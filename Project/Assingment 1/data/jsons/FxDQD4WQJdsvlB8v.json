Readers can check the full fact check , but in summary , we noted that most gun deaths \u2014 more than 60 percent in 2013 \u2014 are actually suicides . The data used in the National Journal chart calculates the number of gun-related deaths per 100,000 people by including all gun deaths , including homicides , suicides , accidental gun deaths and legal intervention involving firearms .

Also , like the New York Times , he references the AR-15 rifle , which was not used in Orlando :\nThere is significant contrary data that shows the 10-year assault weapons ban had little , if any , effect . A 2004 study for the Justice Department found that the ban \u2019 s impact on gun violence was mixed , at best ; if the ban were renewed , the \u201c likely effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. \u201d The report said that assault weapons were \u201c rarely used \u201d in gun crimes ... Did the assault weapons ban make a difference in mass shootings ?
