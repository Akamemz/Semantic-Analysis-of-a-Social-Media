    "content": "President Donald Trump has proposed a `` big league '' ( or is it `` bigly '' ? ) tax reform plan that 's not perfect \u2013 but it is just about as good as one can expect . It 's best part is that by spurring growth , it will undercut his own ethno-nationalistic agenda , which is why , if progressives had any sense , a big `` if '' , they 'd support it instead of demagoguing it !\nIf they are looking for something to fight , Trump 's ridiculous plans to increase defense spending offer a ton load of ammo . It is nuts that he wants $ 56 billion more in annual defense spending in a country that already spends as much as the next seven countries combined . And conservative deficit hawks worried about the budget ought to concentrate on curbing his new domestic spending , especially his proposed $ 1 trillion on infrastructure ( after his predecessor lavished almost the same amount with literally nothing to show for it except bridges to nowhere ) .\nTrump noted that there were two principles\u2014both noble\u2014guiding his plan : Simplifying the tax code and lowering the tax burden on individuals and corporations .\nThe most conspicuous mark of his seriousness of this is what he did n't do , namely , embrace the Border Adjustment Tax loopiness of House Republicans that he himself had initially encouraged . They wanted to offset revenue losses from tax cuts by taxing imports to the tune of $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade from countries with higher tariffs than the United States . But this was a poison pill that , apart from being horrendously protectionist ( that a free-trader like Speaker Paul Ryan has surely earned a lot of bad karma for embracing ) , would have infinitely complicated the tax code for American businesses that have supply chains that span the globe , while sticking it to American consumers who 'd face higher prices .\nBut what he wants to do to simplify taxes for individual filers is good too . Broadly , he wants to reduce the tax brackets for individuals from seven to three and eliminate tax breaks and deductions except for those for charity and home ownership . To mitigate the tax increases that some might face due to this , he 'll double the personal tax deductions . And as a special fuck you to high-tax liberal states such as California and New York that did n't vote for him , he 's proposing to end the deductions for local and state taxes . Most of these are steps in the direction of a flatter tax code that 'll one day make the world an infinitely better place by ridding it of tax accountants and lawyers . But the other \u2588\u2588\u2588 to applaud it is that a less kinky tax code means a less distorted economy .\nHis ideas to accomplish this goal are decent but not flawless .\nHe wants to eliminate the liberal absurdity that is the Alternative Minimum Tax . When originally enacted in the mid-1960s , it was meant to bring to heel about a 150 super-rich families who were using loopholes and deductions to avoid paying any taxes at all . The AMT required everyone to calculate their taxes at a flat rate without breaks and at the regular rate with breaks and pay whichever was higher . But its been increasingly snagging folks who are not its targets , even after it was modestly indexed for inflation four years ago .\nThe bigger deal , however , is that he would compress the current 10 % , 15 % , 25 % , 28 % , 33 % , 35 % and 39.6 % tax brackets to 10 % , 25 % and 35 % . Clearly , the highest tax-brackets will get a nifty cut ( especially since Trump will also , much to the dismay of liberals , scrap the death tax ) and the lowest will be held harmless . As for the in-between folks , it will be important to pick the right income at which to position it so that a vast majority\u2014if not nearly all\u2014see declines in their tax bill , which will make it politically easier to push through .\nNow , it is true that unlike the corporate tax cuts , reductions in individual tax rates wo n't necessarily spur growth ( although they could remove the disincentives to work and boost productivity ) and hence might add to the deficit . But Cato Institute 's Chris Edwards notes that that can be dealt with by eliminating deductions and credits , which is why Trump 's proposal to offer `` relief for families with child and dependent expenses '' is among the most disappointing aspect of his reform package .\nTrump does n't explicitly say what form this relief would take , but he talked about child-care tax credits during his campaign . These will surely give reformocons wet dreams . But such credits are unfair to folks who do n't have children . And they unwisely pile another entitlement on top of the existing entitlement state , making its reform more elusive .\nThat flaw , however , does n't negate the crowning achievement that is his corporate tax reform proposal , the centerpiece of his package .\nTrump would slash corporate tax rates from 35 percent ( 39 percent when state taxes are included ) to 15 percent and end America 's system of worldwide taxation that taxes companies even on their foreign income . Liberals have not yet figured out that taxing worldwide income discourages multinational companies from domiciling in America and loses , instead of gains , Uncle Sam revenues . Hence it is unlikely that they will do anything but play spoilsport on this measure . But there are quite a few liberals who have grokked that America 's corporate tax rates undermine America 's global competitiveness because these taxes are the highest in the developed world . The UK 's current rate is 20 percent going down to 17 percent , Denmark 's 24.5 percent , and Ireland 's an inspiring 12.5 percent .\nThis disparity shamed even President Barack Obama into proposing a 28 percent rate , something that New York 's Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer was in principle on board with . Even Harlem Democrat Rep. Charlie Rangel , who is just about as left as they get before turning into Bernie Sanders , recommended slashing this rate to 30.5 percent .\nBut what 'll give Democrats ( and some Republican deficit hawks ) conniptions , besides the size of this cut , is that Trump has shown no interest in making it revenue-neutral by raising taxes elsewhere or cutting spending . These worries are not baseless but they are overblown\u2014and misplaced , at least at the moment .\nThe Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin may be exaggerating that , `` the tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth . '' But so is the Tax Policy Center , a liberal-leaning outfit , that estimates that the 15 percent rate would lead to a $ 2.4 trillion loss in revenue for Uncle Sam over 10 years .\nCato 's Edwards ' notes that the U.S. corporate tax rates are in the `` strong Laffer zone . '' ( The Laffer curve , named after Arthur Laffer , the economist who formulated it , shows that up to a point , tax cuts lead to an increase in revenues by fueling business expansion , broadening the tax base and attracting more foreign investments . ) Studies examining OECD countries have shown that corporate tax rates above 26 percent reduce government revenues . The U.S. corporate tax rate is 14 percentage points above that rate , which is why America has a lot of room to cut . Indeed , corporate revenues from Canada 's 15 percent central corporate tax rate right now constitute 2.1 percent of the GDP ( which is a bit higher than what it was when those rates were twice as high in the 1980s ) and America 's 35 percent rate 1.7 percent of the GDP , estimates Edwards .\nA 15 percent rate in America may result in some revenue losses despite growth effects . That 's not ideal when America 's annual deficit is approaching $ 590 billion and its total debt , not counting unfunded entitlement liabilities , already exceeds its total GDP .\nBut America 's Number One challenge right now is boosting its sluggish economy that grew a lame 1.6 percent last year , its weakest performance in five years , and lifting stagnant wages , that are growing at a far lower rate than before the Great Recession . And tax cuts that stop penalizing business growth and expansion are the best known tool to man to fix that .\nBut this is not just a matter of improving America lives , but also American politics . The appeal of zero sum ethno-nationalism becomes infinitely greater when a moribund economy turns politics into a zero-sum game of dividing the spoils . Trump won because he found a populist narrative that masterfully combined left-wing class warfare with right-wing nativism . He told American middleclass voters that they were getting screwed , on the one hand , by a corrupt elite hell bent on keeping all the gains for itself and , on the other , immigrants and foreigners who were threatening their livelihoods and lifestyle .\nTrump may not realize it but the appeal of such a zero-sum message goes away in a robust economy that releases the animal spirits of Americans . Economic growth is great not only because it allows consumers to trade their iPhone 6 for an iPhone 7 but because it makes every sectarian divide easier to manage . It will also inevitably require more workers , taking the wind out of Trump 's anti-immigrant bashing .\nTrump , then , may himself be the best cure for Trumpism . That 's why , unless liberals have better ideas for reviving the economy ( and , puhlese , Keynesianism that Obama already tried and spectacularly failed does n't count ) , they should desist from using ad hominem attacks about Trump 's failure to release his tax returns to derail his tax reform . And Republicans who want to tame the federal deficit would do the country a far bigger favor by : ensuring that Trump 's infrastructure package is privately funded , curbing defense spending and reforming Medicare and Social Security . Defense , after all , consumes 16 percent of the federal budget and Medicare-Social Security more than half .\nTrump has finally presented a solid policy reform plan , let him run with it .",
