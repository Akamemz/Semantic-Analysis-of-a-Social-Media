Yet , in Wyoming , one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud .\nYou do n't get to choose your family . Still , family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones . They make others uncomfortable , and hurt those who love them . These people are often thinking only of themselves , and they have n't considered the consequences of their behavior .\nLiz Cheney is one of these people . And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician .\nThe Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi . And because that might not be so easy to do , whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic , it 's difficult to know if she 's speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator .\nAn independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund , which is defending Enzi , recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees .\nThis week , while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it `` gutter politics , '' Cheney stood by those earlier positions . During an interview on `` Fox News Sunday , '' she said :\n`` I do n't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation . If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance , there 's no reason we should n't do that . ''\nNonetheless , that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot , and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she 's trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum , she ca n't be seen as soft on same-sex marriage .\nThus , in the same interview , she made clear that she does n't favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports `` the traditional definition of marriage . ''\nIt 's a position that Cheney has long held . That is part of the problem . In a country where , as public opinion polls make clear , the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue , it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney .\nBesides , she should tread lightly on this subject . Why ? Because blood is thicker than votes . And because Michael Corleone was right , and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you `` do n't ever take sides with anyone against the family . ''\nAnd , for the Cheney family , this issue is personal . Liz 's sister , Mary , is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion , Heather Poe .\n`` I love Mary very much . I love her family very much . This is just an issue in which we disagree , '' Cheney said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''\nMary Cheney was n't having any of it . Not long after the interview , she posted this rebuttal on Facebook :\n`` Liz -- this is n't just an issue on which we disagree -- you 're just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history . ''\nMary also shared a post by Poe , who was likewise bothered by Liz 's comments . It read :\n`` I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday ( yes Liz , in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law ) and was very disappointed to hear her say ' I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage ....\n`` Liz has been a guest in our home , has spent time and shared holidays with our children , and when Mary and I got married in 2012 -- she did n't hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us .\n`` To have her now say she does n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least . ''\nHere is what Liz Cheney missed : To many proponents of marriage equality , the very idea of `` traditional marriage '' is offensive . You see , tradition is the antithesis of progress . It was once tradition that women did n't have the right to vote , and African-Americans used separate restrooms , and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps . Those things had to change , and they did . In those instances , Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness , justice and equality .\nThis year , Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward . The kids are fighting , and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all .\n`` This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years , and we are pained to see it become public , '' Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife , Lynne , said Monday in a statement .\nThey insisted that Liz Cheney has `` always treated her sister and her sister 's family with love and respect , exactly as she should have done .

Dick Cheney has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that -- despite calls for a federal ban on same-sex marriage -- the issue should be handled at the state level .\nI know something about what Liz Cheney is going through .
