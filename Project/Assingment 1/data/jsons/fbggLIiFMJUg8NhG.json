    "content": "Donald Trump made headlines this week while touring India alongside prime minister and \u201c true friend \u201d Narendra Modi , with plenty of fanfare , botched speeches , and questionable broccoli samosas along the way .\nBut this was not just a diplomatic trip for Trump , who made a visible appearance at the Howdy Modi rally held by the Indian diaspora in Houston , Texas , last year . Nor was it solely a display of solidarity with Modi and his far-right administration at a time when India is erupting in protest and sectarian violence centered around an ongoing lockdown and communications blackout in Kashmir , a controversial national registry bill and a stringent citizenship bill that would favor non-Muslim migrants .\nInstead , Trump approached India not as another nation state , but rather another state to turn red , and one more stop on his 2020 campaign trail . And his trip was strategically designed to stoke themes of nationalism and protectionism for those with a foothold in both countries .\nThe Indian American vote in the US has become something to reckon with . It is 1.3 million people strong , and comprises some of the most educated and wealthy people in the country . This is a community that Trump has heavily courted over the years , most notably at a 2016 Hindu American rally in Edison , New Jersey \u2013 an epicenter for Indian Americans \u2013 called Hindus for Trump , before his victory .\nAnd Trump has realized an essential truth about first-generation Indian Americans : even those who immigrated decades ago are often as invested in Indian politics as they are in the US .\nTrump hardly has the diaspora in the bag . Despite the show of support in Edison and Houston , and the increasingly conservative leanings of Hindu nationalists in the US , almost 80 % of Indian Americans voted for Hilary Clinton in 2016 , and the population continues to be heavily blue . A cohesive group of South Asian influencers are supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren in this year \u2019 s Democratic primary , and several Indian Americans are on the core teams of Democratic campaigns .\nTrump \u2019 s target , however , is not these progressives . It is likely those who support Modi-era nationalism and the Hindu establishment in India , but remain ambivalent or moderate while stateside . And while the majority of the Indian American population is centered in California and New York , there are also vital concentrations in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan that could help him retain his hold .\nIt makes sense then that Trump , unlike most American political leaders before him , made his first stop in Ahmedabad , Gujarat , and not in Delhi , the capital , as presidents before him . While the Indian diaspora is incredibly diverse , Gujaratis still dominate the numbers in the Indian American community . And Ahmedabad , the capital , has become a powerful and divisive symbol of the newest rendition of the Hindu nationalist movement .\nIn embracing Ahmedabad , Trump also took the leap that Barack Obama had been navigating in his own relationship with Modi , by deciding not to directly address the communal violence that happened under the prime minister \u2019 s watch when he was governing Gujarat as chief minister .\nIn this week \u2019 s appearances , Trump made it clear that his trip was directed to the US under the guise of support for India . He highlighted Russian meddling in support of Senator Bernie Sanders \u2019 campaign ( which Sanders denounced ) , and talked about how the markets would soar if he was re-elected in November .\nAnd as nine civilians died just miles away from his press conference in Delhi , he wrapped up his trip with an America-focused speech that criticized the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor , and Representative Adam Schiff , who had been leading the impeachment charge .\nIt \u2019 s unclear if Trump \u2019 s India act will work . Though many wealthy Indian Americans support Trump , as they did previous Republican candidates , his anti-immigrant policies have taken a toll on south Asian families in the US , and those who would benefit from a trade agreement between the two countries .
