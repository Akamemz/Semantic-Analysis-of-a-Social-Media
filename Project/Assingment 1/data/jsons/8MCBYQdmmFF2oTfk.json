    "content": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski was knee-deep in the starting ceremony for the world-famous Iditarod dog-sled race on Saturday in Anchorage when her phone blew up . On the other end of the line was Sen. Tom Cotton , eager to recruit as many Republican senators as he could for a letter to Iran \u2019 s leadership that would soon anger the White House and inflame partisan tensions in Congress .\nThe Alaska Republican ultimately declined , one of seven GOP senators to tell Cotton \u201c thanks , but no thanks. \u201d But the exchange highlighted the methodical approach that Cotton , a freshman senator from Arkansas with an Ivy League CV and multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan , is taking behind the scenes as he emerges as one of the chief antagonists of President Barack Obama \u2019 s foreign policy .\nWith his missive to Iran \u2019 s political leadership , ultimately co-signed with 46 of his GOP colleagues , and the fallout over his unusual attempt to circumvent the president \u2019 s foreign policy deal-making , Cotton has rocketed to the top of TV bookers \u2019 lists , and fellow Republican senators are suddenly flocking to him for counsel on foreign policy .\nAll before he \u2019 s even given his maiden speech on the Senate floor .\nCotton has gained prominence with a disciplined adherence to talking points on television and the campaign trail . He easily ousted former Sen. Mark Pryor last year , a centrist Democrat from Arkansas political royalty , in one of the most hard-fought and expensive Senate races in the country . With his letter and a few headline-grabbing speeches in his Senate committees , Cotton is showing that driving a message can be just as important to building a profile in the Senate as amassing bipartisan support for legislation .\nAnd he \u2019 s clearly winning the favor of his colleagues while doing it \u2014 at least the Republican ones .\n\u201c I wasn \u2019 t necessarily thinking this guy \u2019 s going to be the greatest possible replacement , \u201d said a Republican lawmaker . \u201c But , I \u2019 m impressed . \u201d\nThough he clearly has media savvy \u2014 he runs a guerrilla-like Twitter account that constantly blasts Obama \u2019 s foreign policy \u2014 Cotton has little regard for the media relationships of his forebears . He declined \u2014 three times \u2014 to answer questions for this story when approached in the Senate hallways . Instead , Cotton chose a spate of cable TV interviews and an interview with The Wall Street Journal to push his message this week .\nThe youngest senator in the chamber at 37 , Cotton has emerged as a leader of the next generation of GOP hawks . His ascent comes amid internal party battles over foreign policy that appeared to give increased influence to the non-interventionist policies embodied by Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) . With support from the conservative wing of the party as well as leadership , Cotton has risen from the House to Senate in two years and is seen by some Republicans as an eventual White House contender .\nCotton is already making his mark on presidential politics . He persuaded Paul , as well as three other potential senators running for president to co-sign his letter , plus Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal . He is one of a dozen GOP freshmen , leading a class that \u2019 s more hawkish than the one the 2010 tea party wave ushered in .\n\u201c By virtue of his military service , he \u2019 s got a lot of credibility on these issues . And I \u2019 m glad to see him step up , \u201d said Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) .\nBut Cotton \u2019 s Iran move has brought out plenty of critics too , from the seven Republicans who didn \u2019 t sign on to his letter to the president , vice president and the Democratic Party \u2019 s presumptive 2016 front-runner , Hillary Clinton .\nThey say Cotton crossed the line from opposing the president on philosophical grounds to undermining him on the international stage .\nCotton \u2019 s letter \u201c undermined , I think , our standing in the world . And ultimately , when you undermine our standing , you \u2019 re undermining our national security , \u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo. ) . \u201c I hope it \u2019 s an aberration and not a precedent . \u201d\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) also chided Cotton on Monday him for displaying such \u201c pettiness \u201d just 62 days into his Senate career . It \u2019 s a criticism that Cotton \u2019 s elders say is unwarranted .\n\u201c To suggest , like some have , that Tom Cotton hasn \u2019 t been here long enough to comment on foreign policy ? \u201d said Sen. Richard Burr , chairman of the Intelligence Committee , on which Cotton serves . \u201c That \u2019 s a pretty bold statement to make about somebody who \u2019 s gone , been shot at , defended his buddies and , more importantly , defended the country . \u201d\nThis isn \u2019 t Cotton \u2019 s first bout of controversy in the Senate , though it \u2019 s by far his most prominent . At a Senate Banking Committee hearing in January , he tried to make an Iran sanctions bill more strict and said he had little patience for Obama \u2019 s pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran , admitting weeks before his Iran letter was released that he \u2019 d prefer that talks fall apart .\n\u201c I would rather see this negotiation end because I think the administration is committed to a deal at all costs . Or is committed to letting Iran achieve in slow motion what they could otherwise not achieve through a deal , \u201d he said .\nBanking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) says many Republicans were glad to hear that kind of fire from their chamber \u2019 s youngest member : \u201c I wasn \u2019 t surprised at all . A lot of us have those thoughts , and words . He says \u2019 em . \u201d\nCotton was even blunter during a February hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee , attacking President Barack Obama \u2019 s plans to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay .\n\u201c The only problem with Guant\u00e1namo Bay is there are too many empty beds in cells there right now , \u201d he thundered . \u201c We should be sending more terrorists there for further interrogation to keep this country safe . As far as I \u2019 m concerned , every last one of them can rot in hell . But as long as they don \u2019 t do that , they can rot in Guant\u00e1namo Bay . \u201d\nThough Cotton \u2019 s letter has revealed internal GOP divisions between those who signed the letter and those who did not , there was little dissension during the party \u2019 s private lunch on Tuesday , sources said . The only concern that senators discussed was caution moving forward on Iran so as not to further alienate Democratic hawks when it finally comes time to vote on an Iran bill sometime in early April .\nIf there was any surprise about the letter in the GOP , it was over the firestorm it generated , from the New York Daily News \u2019 \u201c Traitors \u201d headline featuring Cotton \u2019 s mug to giving Hillary Clinton a way to ease into a news conference about her emails by laying into the GOP Senate .\nWhen Cotton first began circulating the letter for signatures one day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress over the \u201c very bad \u201d Iran deal that Obama was working toward , many Republican senators signed on with little reservation .\n\u201c I saw the letter , I saw that it looked reasonable to me and I signed it , that \u2019 s all . I sign lots of letters , \u201d said Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) .\nThe text of the document was written by Cotton himself , his office said , and he had hoped to push it out last week after circulating it among his GOP colleagues . But Washington was socked by a snowstorm , a Senate session was scuttled and the weekend came .\nCotton had no success in a short conversation with Sen. Jeff Flake ( R-Ariz. ) , who \u201c didn \u2019 t feel it was appropriate or productive at this point \u201d to sign the letter . He too met with resistance from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) , who concluded that Cotton is a \u201c nice guy \u201d who \u2019 s going in a different direction on Iran than Corker \u2019 s pursuit of bipartisanship .\nAnd Cotton ultimately got the cold shoulder from Murkowski as well , as she watched sled dogs prepare for the Iditarod .\n\u201c I said : \u2018 I \u2019 m going to have to get back with you Tom. \u2019 And I did , \u201d Murkowski recounted .
