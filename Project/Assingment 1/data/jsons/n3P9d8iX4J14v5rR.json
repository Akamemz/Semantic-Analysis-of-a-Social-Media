Instead of probing his vague answers , they complacently accepted them before trailing off into the next series of unilluminating questions .\n\u201c I have no information that supports those tweets , \u201d Comey replied to one of Schiff \u2019 s leading questions . Why didn \u2019 t Republicans ask him to elaborate ? Was he saying that the FBI didn \u2019 t investigate the computer server connected to Trump Tower ( as reported by Circa News ) ? Was he saying that his investigation hasn \u2019 t intercepted a single one of Trump \u2019 s communications ? He would have declined to answer these questions , but that refusal to answer would have cast doubt on the authority of his categorical denial . After all , if he can \u2019 t describe his investigation into the Trump campaign , how can anybody be sure that it excludes Trump \u2019 s communications ?\nCongressman Devin Nunes , the chairman of the committee , couldn \u2019 t match Schiff in partisan zeal and rigor , as evident in his giving Schiff fifteen minutes of opening remarks while restricting himself to five minutes of them .

Why let the hearing become a referendum on Trump \u2019 s tweeting ? Why place the emphasis on that and not on the one suggestive remark Nunes did make , which he didn \u2019 t pursue very effectively and asserted more weakly than necessary , that \u201c it \u2019 s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates \u201d ? Still possible ? Given that any investigation involves surveillance of some kind , it is not possible but certain that FBI agents have engaged in those activities .\nThe insufferable Louise Mensch of Heat Street , the anti-Trump activist who got one of the criminal leaks last fall about the FBI investigation , says that the FBI sought \u201c incidental \u201d interceptions of \u201c Trump \u2019 s campaign. \u201d How are they incidental if sought ? What does it matter , in terms of violated privacy , if the wiretap was on the Trump campaign \u2019 s phones/computers or the phones/computers of the person/institutions with whom the campaign may have been communicating ?

Again , Comey would have refused to answer , but at least his non-answer would have gotten people thinking about the abusive character of an open-ended investigation of a candidate \u2019 s campaign during an election season .\nAnd what was Comey doing investigating the Trump campaign in the first place ? Where did Comey get the idea to investigate the Trump campaign ? That subject deserved more attention than it received at the hearing .
