Today \u2019 s polarized politics make the filibuster a procedural wall . In recent years both sides have used procedural \u201c nuclear options \u201d to bypass it for judicial nominations . Is it only a matter of time before the whole thing topples ?\nBut the filibuster is a Senate tradition . It \u2019 s meant to protect minority rights . In essence , it subjects contested bills and nominations to a 60-vote Senate threshold . In theory it forces both sides to work together to find paths forward acceptable to all .\nIs the filibuster slowing the progress of American democracy ? Both President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren say it is . The former blames it for the GOP Senate \u2019 s failure to get rid of Obamacare , among other things . The latter believes it could hinder the passage of climate and gun control legislation if a Democrat wins the White House next year .\nTo scrap or not to scrap ? Lawmakers are again wrestling with that recurrent , abiding question about the filibuster , the wonky Senate procedure that some say is a key agent of obstruction in Congress .\nPresident Donald Trump has placed himself squarely in Camp Scrap , urging Senate Republicans to get rid of the filibuster so that the GOP can muscle through legislation on controversial issues like immigration without needing bipartisan support .\nFormer Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made a similar case earlier this month in a New York Times op-ed , in which he urged his party to eliminate the procedure once they regain power . Otherwise the Senate will never act on issues such as climate change and guns , he said .\nA few days later , current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , issued a rebuttal , defending the filibuster and accusing Democrats of wanting to run roughshod over Senate tradition in order to \u201c inflict \u201d a \u201c laundry list of socialist policies \u201d on Middle America .\nThe 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are also split on the issue . Some agree with former Senator Reid that it \u2019 s blocking liberal change . Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , for instance , backs its elimination . Others warn that in the long run Senate Democrats would regret losing such a powerful legislative weapon .\nHow much is the filibuster really to blame for legislative gridlock ? What would it take to get rid of it , and what could the long-term effects look like ?\nHere \u2019 s a primer on the Senate \u2019 s favorite scapegoat , and the cases for and against it .\nThe filibuster is , in essence , any attempt by a senator to block a measure by preventing it from coming to a vote .\nOne way of doing that is to physically stand on the Senate floor and speak \u2013 because according to Senate rules , a senator can pretty much talk for as long as he or she wants ( with some exceptions ) , and a bill can \u2019 t go to a vote if any senator still wants to say something . Think \u201c Mr . Smith Goes to Washington , \u201d the 1939 film where Jimmy Stewart \u2019 s character , a senator named Jefferson Smith , speaks on the Senate floor for 25 hours to postpone the vote on an appropriations bill ( and defend his innocence in a villainous graft scheme ) .\nToday \u2019 s filibuster , though , is a lot less dramatic , most often coming by way of a clunky procedural mechanism called cloture .\nBefore 1917 , a senator could stand and speak until the end of time , if he wanted . Debate would end only when the senator gave up or got concessions he could live with from his colleagues . But that year , President Woodrow Wilson \u2013 pressured to act against Germany toward the end of World War I \u2013 urged senators to create a way to close debate more quickly , and Rule 22 was born .\nUnder Rule 22 , a group of at least 16 senators can file a cloture motion , or a motion to end debate over a piece of legislation . If three-fifths of the senators present \u2013 typically 60 \u2013 vote to invoke cloture , debate ends . The Senate then moves to an up-or-down vote on the bill in question .\nThese days , senators are \u201c filibustering \u201d when they agree to be part of the minority needed to vote against cloture on any debatable matter the Senate is considering . The bottom line is that a large enough minority can block action on a bill or personnel nomination \u2013 even if the bill or nomination itself would have had enough support to pass .\n\u201c You \u2019 re no longer requiring a senator to stand on the floor to keep talking , \u201d says Mark Schmitt , director of policy reform at the Washington think tank New America . \u201c It just becomes , \u2018 Do you have 60 votes ? \u2019 \u201d\nWhen people talk about abolishing the filibuster , what do they mean \u2013 and how would it happen ?\nThe word \u201c filibuster \u201d never actually appears in the Senate rule book . Eliminating the filibuster today means lowering the 60-vote threshold needed to block a measure to a simple majority by amending existing Senate rules . If only 51 senators were needed to end debate , the reasoning goes , then it would be much harder for the minority to block or delay the final vote on a bill .\nNow , a Senate rule can be changed via majority vote on a simple resolution . But if the change is controversial and opponents are willing to mount a filibuster , rules changes require a supermajority of senators \u2013 typically 67 \u2013 in favor .\nIn recent years , senators who \u2019 ve wanted to change the rules haven \u2019 t been able to get that supermajority . Instead they \u2019 ve employed what \u2019 s called the \u201c nuclear option . \u201d\nIn 2013 , Democrats under Majority Leader Reid ignored the two-thirds rule and voted by simple majority to lower the threshold needed to invoke cloture during the confirmation process for almost all executive nominations \u2013 effectively eliminating the filibuster for most presidential appointees . In 2017 , Republicans under Majority Leader McConnell did the same to include Supreme Court nominees .\nIn both cases , the senators pushing for change wanted to speed up the process of confirming appointees and rely less on their colleagues from across the aisle to do it . Each time , they used arcane legislative maneuvers that some experts judge aboveboard , but others say involved violations of previously existing Senate procedures .\nGiven how slim Senate majorities have become , and how difficult it is to get 67 senators to agree on anything , any effort to abolish the legislative filibuster would likely again involve the nuclear option .\nIt sounds like the filibuster is meant to give the minority leverage . While the 2020 map looks better for Senate Democrats , who are in the minority now , than the 2018 one did , they still face an uphill climb to the majority .\nSo why would Democrats push to get rid of the filibuster , which would theoretically benefit a Republican majority ? The filibuster , after all , historically empowers a single senator , or a large enough minority of senators , to slow down debate and encourage bipartisan buy-in .\nExcept the filibuster doesn \u2019 t really work that way anymore . Over the years , both parties have used the filibuster more as a tool to block laws indefinitely rather than to negotiate any sort of meaningful deal with the other side , congressional scholars say .\n\u201c The filibuster could be a useful tool in a more open Senate , \u201d Mr. Schmitt says . \u201c It all works differently when everything \u2019 s following party lines . \u201d\nSome suggest that a filibuster-free Senate could advantage the left in the long haul . While Senate majorities are increasingly short-lived , progressives could use their time in the sun to pass sweeping social reforms \u2013 and some theorize that it \u2019 s incredibly difficult to roll back major social benefits once they \u2019 ve been passed .\nBut generally , those calling for filibuster reform today see Democrats beating the odds and reclaiming unified control of government in 2020 , only to find Republicans blocking their agenda at every turn . Republicans tend to control states with smaller , less diverse populations , but \u2013 the argument goes \u2013 the filibuster as used today could give the GOP an effective veto over legislation supported by both a majority in the Senate and a majority of Americans .\n\u201c More and more Democratic activists are picking up on the fact that the filibuster , either by purpose or unintended consequences , is benefiting a certain amount of small-population states , \u201d Jim Manley , a former top Democratic aide , tells The Atlantic . \u201c There \u2019 s an inherent unfairness to the Senate that more and more people are focusing on . \u201d\nOne argument rests on tradition . The framers of the Constitution always envisioned the Senate as a more deliberative body than the majority-run House of Representatives ; James Madison described it as a \u201c necessary fence \u201d against the \u201c fickleness and passion \u201d that tended to influence members of the House . According to this line of thinking , the filibuster serves as a tool that helps maintain that deliberative quality .\nThe cynical view is that the filibuster \u2013 or specifically , the supermajority requirement to end debate \u2013 makes it easier for senators to duck out of difficult votes . Because the 60-vote threshold is almost impossible to hit on any legislation , senators can take a more radical position than they \u2019 d like , or not take a position at all , without suffering blame or consequence .\n\u201c The filibuster has become a way to shift blame to someone else , to [ either ] an oppressive and draconian majority or a totally empowered minority , \u201d says James Wallner , a senior fellow at the R Street Institute who \u2019 s written extensively about Senate procedure . \u201c It \u2019 s a way to say , \u2018 I can \u2019 t do X . Therefore it \u2019 s OK for me to stop trying . \u2019 \u201d\nBesides , he says , getting rid of the filibuster wouldn \u2019 t necessarily end Senate gridlock . Growing partisanship will still be a problem . So will the precedent that gives the majority leader the ability to be recognized on the floor first \u2013 because that allows him ( or her ) to offer the maximum number of amendments permitted on a piece of legislation before anyone else can .
