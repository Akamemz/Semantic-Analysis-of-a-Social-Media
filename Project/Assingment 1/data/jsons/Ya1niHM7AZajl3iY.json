Many would say our apparent inability to engage in respectful and nuanced conversations has hit a crisis level .\nThat is why April 20-28 has been declared the National Week of Conversation by the Bridge Alliance , a coalition of several civic action groups founded by people from across the political spectrum .\nOne hundred organizations are sponsoring the National Week of Conversation ( NWOC ) . Events will be held in cities across the country . It is a week `` for mending America one conversation at a time , '' according to the NWOC website .\nAnd while our elected officials are often at the heart of the ongoing partisan bickering , several are joining the Bridge Alliance and its partners to offer a better alternative than the toxic , hyper-partisan status quo .\nFrom the Halls of Congress to Your Community : The Growing Demands for Civility\nThe national community organizer for the National Institute for Civil Discourse , Cheryl Graeve , explained in an interview for \u2588\u2588\u2588 that some of the events policymakers will be a part of will be open to the public , while others will be more personal and private .\n`` For example , Ohio members of Congress Steve Stivers ( R ) and Joyce Beatty ( D ) have established a Congressional Civility and Respect Caucus , and will be having conversations with their caucus members , '' she says . They will also host workshops over the next few months for members of Congress to address the need for greater civility and respect in Washington .\nMost people probably do n't know there is such a thing as a Congressional Civility and Respect Caucus in Congress . It was created in January by Stivers and Beatty to encourage civility and respect in political discourse on Capitol Hill and in every congressional district .\n`` Joyce and I don \u2019 t always agree on how to solve the issues facing our nation , but we find common ground where we can .

In other words , if a Republican wanted to join the caucus , he or she would have to join with a Democratic colleague .\n`` It 's a beautiful model of coming together across the aisle to be part of rebuilding and reweaving a more civil fabric in our country , '' she says .\nThen there are more private and personal conversations that will happen between state and local policy leaders , faith leaders , and candidates that will seek to foster productive conversations on the biggest issues in each participant 's respective community .\n`` Sometimes , those conversations which we hope will both foster relationships and help us explore what we may do together as citizens and policymakers and the media to improve the tone of our conversations and public discourse -- especially as we look at 2018 now -- sometimes those conversations can happen in a more authentic and personal and deep way when they are outside the glare of the public spotlight , '' Graeve explains .\nThe media might not like it .
