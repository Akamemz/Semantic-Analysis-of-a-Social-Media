    "content": "When Colleen Fay of Mount Rainier , Maryland , came out as transgender 12 years ago to her parish music director , she was fired from her position on the choir . She later described feeling like she was in \u201c doctrinal limbo \u201d because there is no universal teaching on gender from the church .\n\u201c I \u2019 m hurt by the Catholic Church every single day , \u201d she said . \u201c They want me and they don \u2019 t want me . \u201d\nOn June 10 , the Vatican released a document that seems to seek to clarify the ambivalence Fay and other transgender Catholics have described . It is the most comprehensive document on gender identity the Vatican has ever released . Called \u201c Male and Female He Created Them : Towards a Path of Dialogue on the Questions of Gender Theory in Education , \u201d the document aims to address what it calls \u201c educational crisis \u201d surrounding sexuality and gender .\nBut its conclusion has not been received favorably by trans Catholics ; it says that Catholic schools must help teach young people that gender is fixed at birth . According to the Congregation for Catholic Education , the Vatican office that released the document , \u201c gender theory \u201d has misled people to think that gender is different from biological sex .\n\u201c Oscillation between male and female becomes , at the end of the day , only a \u2018 provocative \u2019 display against so-called \u2018 traditional frameworks \u2019 , and one which , in fact , ignores the suffering of those who have to live situations of sexual indeterminacy , \u201d the authors write .\nThe announcement comes at a time when trans people \u2019 s rights are under threat on a national level . Last month the Trump administration announced a proposal to roll back protections for discrimination against trans people by healthcare providers . Transgender people make up only 0.6 percent of the US population , and they are about 8 times as likely to report attempting suicide than the rest of the population . This rate rises even higher depending on the type of discrimination they are subject to , says a 2014 study by the Williams Institute .\nIt is not clear why the Congregation for Catholic Education has decided to weigh in on gender identity now . The past few years have seen a rapid increase in conversations about LGBTQ Catholics within the church \u2014 the Vatican used the acronym LGBT for the first time in June of last year , in a document written for a meeting of bishops in Rome . In a final version of the document , the acronym was removed .\nIn the United States , attitudes of Catholics have been shifting . Sixty-eight percent of Catholics in the United States say they feel more supportive toward transgender rights than they did five years ago , compared to 62 percent of the general population , according to a survey conducted this year by Public Religion Research Institute ( PRRI ) . In 2017 , Father James Martin , a Jesuit priest , wrote \u201c Building a Bridge : How the Catholic Church and the LGBTQ Community Can Enter into a Relationship of Respect , Compassion , and Sensitivity , \u201d a book that affirmed LGBTQ Catholics and received praise from several bishops as well as members of the LGBTQ community for advancing the conversation on this topic .\nThe new document talks about gender and transgender people in a less polemical way than the church has done previously . ( Pope Francis , for example , has in the past compared arguments for transgender rights to those for nuclear weapons . ) It dedicates a section to \u201c Listening \u201d and \u201c Points of Agreement \u201d that concedes that \u201c unjust discrimination \u201d has been \u201c a sad fact of history \u201d and has taken place within the church . But it also reiterates views that the pope and the US bishops expressed which characterize transgender people as \u201c choosing \u201d their gender , which themselves have been called transphobic and discriminatory by some trans Catholics .\nSo what does this mean for transgender Catholics ? Here , five trans Catholics respond .\nThere is no evidence in this document that its authors have spent any time listening to transgender or intersex people .\n\u201c Gender identity \u201d is not about choosing which gender you would rather be , but noticing which gender you already are , as a gift given to you by God .
