Yes , it really is that simple , \u201d they explain in their mission statement .\nThis slogan is simply dishonest ; rich people do , in fact , pay taxes . Just under half ( 48 percent ) of federal revenue comes from income taxes . If you define the rich as the top 1 percent \u2014 which is probably too narrow , depending on the region of the country \u2014 the rich pay a big chunk of that . In 2016 , according to the Tax Foundation , the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income-tax revenue , a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined .

It \u2019 s not preposterous to argue that the rich , however defined , should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness .
