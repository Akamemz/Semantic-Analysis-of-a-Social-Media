    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Sooner or later , many of the President 's subordinates face the same dilemma .\nThey can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump . It 's often just not possible to do both .\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen became the latest Cabinet member to pay the price for not letting Trump do what he wants -- and on the issue he cares about more than any other -- when she was forced to resign on Sunday .\nIt was a case of the Trump revolution eating one of its own , since Nielsen , an immigration hardliner , was seen as insufficiently doctrinaire despite becoming the face of the zero-tolerance immigration policy that led to child separations and caused outrage last year .\nBut CNN reporting makes clear that Nielsen also lost her job because she ultimately came to believe that Trump 's wilder impulses on immigration -- an issue that he sees as critical to his reelection in 2020 -- threatened America 's security and may have run contrary to the law .\nNielsen is not the first senior Cabinet official to lose their career after coming up against Trump 's vision of his own authority -- or his instinct to elevate largely unaccountable appointees , such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller or his son-in-law , Jared Kushner .\nIn their own ways , former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , former FBI Director James Comey and even former Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- the spiritual father of much of the administration 's immigration policy -- suffered a similar fate .\nUnlike the President , these public servants eventually concluded that the Constitution , the rule of law and the norms of democratic governance rendered some of Trump 's behavior unacceptable .\nNielsen 's departure , which was accompanied by a White House sweep against her department that also accounted for the director of the Secret Service , sends a signal that Trump is ready to do whatever it takes to stem the crisis on the US-Mexico border , which is threatening to expose his vows to stem the flows of migrants from Central America as hollow .\nThat will be welcome news for Trump 's supporters , who relish his bypassing of the Washington establishment and overwhelmingly back his hard line on immigration and warnings that the US is under siege by an invading tide of criminals .\nBut the President 's desire to honor the faith of his base on immigration eventually made Nielsen 's position untenable .\nCNN 's Jake Tapper reported on a series of clashes leading up to Nielsen 's ouster on Sunday that reveal a President demanding obeisance to his orders , even if they cross legal lines .\nA `` ranting and raving '' Trump demanded the closure of the US-Mexico border at El Paso , Texas , in late March , despite being told by Nielsen it was a dangerous idea , according to an attendee at a White House meeting .\nTrump has also been pushing to reinstate and escalate the separations of undocumented migrant parents and children at the border , despite the practice being outlawed by the courts and causing bipartisan and international outrage .\nThe newly purged Department of Homeland Security may well embark on a policy that has been discussed for months that would give migrants at the border a tough decision to make : Remain united as a family in detention or agree to be separated while the parents go through the immigration court process , a senior administration official told CNN 's Jim Acosta .\nThe President also told border agents last week not to let any more asylum seekers into the country , forcing officials to quietly countermand his instructions after he had left the room , Tapper reported .\nCNN also reported Monday that Trump is regretting his climb down on a vow to slam shut the southern border -- despite being warned that it could trigger an economic disaster for many Americans .\nAs the final days of Nielsen 's tenure were unfolding , it was Miller , perhaps
