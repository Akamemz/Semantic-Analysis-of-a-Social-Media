    "content": "President Donald Trump just said he wants America to have a \u201c space force \u201d charged with protecting America in , well , space . The problem is that it \u2019 s unclear he will actually get one .\nOn Monday , Trump signed an executive order meant to create the space force , which would be the sixth branch of the US military ( but the White House text of the order doesn \u2019 t feature a directive to create the space force ) . He then asked Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to oversee the creation of the new service . If it \u2019 s officially created , the Air Force would likely give up all of its space duties to the space force , including preparing for war in space and protecting US satellites from harm .\n\u201c We have the Air Force , and we \u2019 re going to have the space force , \u201d Trump said during a speech from the White House . \u201c Separate but equal . \u201d\nTrump has long called for the creation of a space force , saying in March that it would be \u201c like the Army and the Navy , but for space , because we \u2019 re spending a lot of money on space. \u201d There was even a congressional push last year that tried to formally create the new service .\nBut Congress flatly rejected that proposal . In this fiscal year \u2019 s must-pass defense budget bill , both the House and the Senate decided against a new space force , preferring instead to keep space defense within the Air Force .\nThat doesn \u2019 t seem to matter to Trump , since he has now ordered the creation of the space-focused service . It \u2019 s unclear whether Trump can actually create a military branch out of thin air . But one thing is for sure : He doesn \u2019 t have much support for it .\nA senior congressional source told me that Congress \u2014 not the president \u2014 would need to authorize a new military service , just like it did in 1947 when it created the Air Force . After all , the Constitution is clear that the Congress has the authority \u201c to raise and support armies . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s another problem : The Air Force is adamantly against a space force . \u201c The Pentagon is complicated enough , \u201d Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters last summer . \u201c This will make it more complex , add more boxes to the organization chart . \u201d\nEven Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis came out against it . \u201c I oppose the creation of a new military service and additional organizational layers at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting efforts , \u201d Mattis wrote in a letter to congressional defense leaders last October .\nOf course , there \u2019 s nothing stopping Trump from wanting a space force or even ordering its establishment . It \u2019 s just an open question as to whether there will ever be a space force .\n\u201c [ T ] he near-term practical effect of all this is that the president can direct DoD to come up with a plan and start preparing to create a space force , but he still needs congress to authorize it , \u201d Todd Harrison , a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank , tweeted on Monday .\nThere \u2019 s a good case to make for a space force , though .\n\u201c Space is no longer a peaceful domain , \u201d Deborah Lee James , the Obama administration \u2019 s final Air Force secretary , said in an interview last July . \u201c There is a real possibility that a conflict on Earth could bleed into space . \u201d\nThere are two main reasons for that : Russia and China . According to the Defense Intelligence Agency , Russia wants to gain more power in space because it believes gaining supremacy there will allow it to win future fights on this planet . And in late 2015 , China created the Strategic Support Force , which is meant to streamline and improve its space , cyber , and electronic warfare missions .\nThe two countries are causing problems with anti-satellite technology , too , noted Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last May \u2014 meaning they could mess with the satellites that help the US military do its job . The Pentagon is planning to open a space-war center to counter their threats .\nOkay , but ... what sort of conflict is actually going on in space ? What are we really talking about ?\nBasically , there are tons of military equipment in space , especially satellites . This kind of equipment helps the US , Russia , and China \u2014 and any tech-savvy force \u2014 navigate terrain and communicate with one another . On top of that , assets in space help to track enemy fighters , take pictures for intelligence services , and even help control missiles . Without space , it would be much harder to fight on Earth ; that \u2019 s why Russia and China are investing so heavily in it .\nBut Russia and China aren \u2019 t space \u2019 s only threats . The area just outside Earth \u2019 s orbit has seen an explosion of commercial satellites and other communications equipment since the 1960s , put there first by countries and , as of late , by commercial companies . That equipment is used to help drivers reach their destination , help potential lovers swipe right on dating apps , or simply help people text friends .\nThe chart below shows the huge growth in these satellites . The blue line represents their total growth since around 1960 .\nThe internet , of course , adds a new complication to all the equipment that countries are putting in space . Most notably , equipment can potentially be hacked . For instance , a team of hackers could jam a satellite by messing with its signals so it interrupts the satellite \u2019 s normal activity , rendering it useless . That could cause problems for all sorts of everyday activities , like credit card transactions and phone calls .\nThen , of course , there \u2019 s space debris threatening all of that commercial and military space equipment , since it could knock into the expensive machines . NASA estimates that there are 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth , about 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger , and many millions of pieces that are too small to register .\nThe idea is that creating a new service will ensure that there \u2019 s a segment of the military whose entire job is to focus on space 100 percent of the time . That would allow a space force to counter Russia , China , and other threats while giving space-focused staff more bureaucratic power inside the Pentagon .\nBut Sean O \u2019 Keefe , a former NASA head and Navy secretary , thinks creating a brand new branch of the military is not the right way to go . \u201c This is a solution in search of a problem , \u201d he told me in an interview last summer . Basically , he thinks the Air Force is already doing a fine job protecting space , even if it does privilege earthbound pilots . Creating a space force would just add another layer of bureaucracy to an already massive organization : the Pentagon .\nJames , the former Air Force secretary , agrees . She thinks dealing with the current complaints about the Air Force and space \u2014 1 ) that it \u2019 s not well-funded , 2 ) that acquisition takes too long , and 3 ) that there is no one person to call about military space operations \u2014 makes more sense .\nSo clearly the space force has its detractors , not least Defense Secretary Mattis . And of course , Congress has yet to officially mandate its creation .\nBut with Trump \u2019 s comments on Monday , the space force conversation has kicked into hyperdrive . Time will tell if future US troops will be wearing space helmets .",
