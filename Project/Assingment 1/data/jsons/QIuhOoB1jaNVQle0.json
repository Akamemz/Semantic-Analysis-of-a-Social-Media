Many commenters linked the alleged attack to larger alleged sicknesses : \u201c The racist , homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is far-right America \u2019 s endgame , \u201d tweeted GQ , in a sentiment echoed by many others .\nPossibly it might be wise to establish whether an incident actually happened before leaping to conclusions about it . Remember Covington ? Oh , right , that was almost a whole month ago .\nThe certain tone of the reports about an attack that Jussie Smollett may or may not have suffered was notable given the strange circumstances surrounding the actor \u2019 s claims .
