Seattle , a case challenging the constitutionality of Seattle \u2019 s innovative and successful democracy voucher system . The Supreme Court \u2019 s refusal to hear the case\u2014without any noted dissent\u2014means the public financing program is safe for the foreseeable future . It also gives a legal green light to other jurisdictions thinking of adopting a version of this important program .\nThe case arises from Seattle \u2019 s innovative mechanism for publicly financing local elections . Each election cycle , all city residents are given $ 100 in democracy vouchers , which work as coupons that Seattleites may give to local political candidates . Candidates do not need to participate , but those candidates that opt-in to the system can redeem these vouchers for cash to use in their campaigns . The system has now been in place for two cycles , 2017 and 2019 .

Public financing is a voluntary program because no candidate has to opt-in to receive vouchers . Thus , the program does not infringe on anyone \u2019 s speech or ability to raise money .

Backed by the right-wing Pacific Legal Foundation , the plaintiffs argued that democracy vouchers , which are funded by a small property tax increase , are a form of \u201c compelled \u201d speech on unwilling taxpayers . The chain of compulsion is tenuous : the plaintiffs pay taxes ( like everyone who owns property in Seattle ) , and some portion of their tax dollars go toward the democracy vouchers city residents use to fund candidates , and those vouchers in turn may be used to fund campaigns for candidates with which the plaintiffs disagree . They claim this meant that they were \u201c forced \u201d to fund the campaigns of these candidates they did not prefer .
