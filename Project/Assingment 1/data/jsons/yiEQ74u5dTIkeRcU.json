Currently , Americans have a total of roughly $ 1.5 trillion in student loan debt \u2014 and graduate degrees are responsible for a chunk of that debt . Make a payment , instead of worrying about the market . Many credit-card accounts have compound interest rates of 20 % or more . So money spent on that debt can guarantee high returns . Even paying student-loan debt , which typically has lower rates , can guarantee a better return than the market can at times , she said .\nRecommended : Will coronavirus spread throughout the U.S. ? We can all learn from the missteps during those critical , early days in China\nHave you signed up for a retirement account ? There \u2019 s no time like the present . Many employed Americans don \u2019 t have a retirement account at all . If there \u2019 s room in your budget , you can also amp up the amount you contribute to your 401 ( k ) in order to get a contribution match from your employer , if it offers one . For those who don \u2019 t have 401 ( k ) accounts at work , it can be fast to sign up online for a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA . They allow you to save while receiving tax benefits for doing so .\n\u201c Nearly one quarter of the investors in the 401 ( k ) plans managed by Fidelity Investments said they were overinvested in stocks versus recommended levels . \u201d\nFidelity Investments , a major manager of company retirement plans , recently estimated that 23 % of the investors in the 401 ( k ) plans it manages were overinvested in stocks compared to their recommended levels , including 7 % who had their entire 401 ( k ) plan in the stock market . Among baby boomers , who are near or in retirement , 38 % were overinvested in stocks , and 8 % were entirely invested in the stock market .\nIdeally , you will \u201c maximize contributions to your IRA , 401 ( k ) , or 403 ( b ) . You can contribute up to $ 19,500 in 2020 to your 401 ( k ) or 403 ( b ) plan , and if you \u2019 re 50 or older , you can contribute an extra $ 6,500 , \u201d according to Kimberly Foss , the founder of Empyrion Wealth Management in Roseville , Calif. She adds : \u201c And don \u2019 t forget IRAs ; the maximum contribution for 2020 is $ 6,000 , with an extra $ 1,000 catch-up provision in you \u2019 re 50 or older . The tax-free compounding of these retirement accounts is strong magic for your income at retirement time . \u201d\nMany traditional banks offer low interest rates on savings accounts , but there are several online banks offering higher rates to consumers.Consumers holding an emergency fund in cash could be earning more than they are currently , he said , and setting up an online account can take only a few minutes . Look for a savings account that pays a greater than 2 % annual percentage yield . On that note , some financial writers recommend CIT Bank CIT , -2.99 % and Citizens Access , an offshoot of Citizens Bank , Marcus by Goldman Sachs GS , +2.05 % , Synchrony and Barclays .\nResearch from TD Ameritrade \u2014 which looks at people who save 20 % or more of their incomes , called \u201c super savers \u201d \u2014 shows that the single biggest difference between what super savers spent less on , as compared with the rest of us , was housing . Super savers spent just 14 % of their incomes on housing , while regular folks dropped 23 % . What \u2019 s more , more than four in 10 people who fully funded or were very close to fully funding their 401 ( k ) accounts said in another survey that one of the sacrifices they made to save so much was that they lived in a modest home .\nIn less than 15 minutes , you can find out just how financially healthy you are by taking a financial capability quiz . Questions like : Could you come up with $ 2,000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month ? May prompt you to adhere to a stricter budget , especially if you or your partner has to take time off work because of illness .\nOne rule of thumb : dedicate 80 % of your spending budget to necessities like rent , utilities and 20 % for fun splurges like concerts and clothing , according to Northwestern Mutual . A fear-driven rush to sell stocks amidst coronavirus concerns may ignore the less obvious underlying problems in your portfolio . \u201c Are your investments appropriate for your age ? \u201d or \u201c Are you sensibly diversified ? \u201d may help you regain a sense of control over your emotional and financial health .\nClosing your eyes and taking deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth won \u2019 t pay your bills , create a magical bump in the stock market , and it certainly won \u2019 t act as a preventative measure against coronavirus . But it can help you restore a calm mind set to make more rational decisions . There are free apps such as Smiling Mind and one designed by UCLA \u2019 s Mindful Awareness Research Center . YouTube GOOG , +1.76 % also offers guided meditation tutorials .\nOne of the most popular paid meditation apps , Headspace , which costs $ 12.99 a month , offers a catalog of 30-day courses on topics such as how to find focus at work and dealing with regret . They also offer single meditation courses that can last three to 10 minutes . \u201c Our brains have developed to focus on the threat , \u201d said Megan Jones Bell , a clinical psychologist and chief science officer at Headspace . \u201c I think it \u2019 s understandable for people to go down a rabbit hole . \u201d\nMeditation helps people \u201c deactivate that emotional center of the brain which is sensitive to negative reactions that keep us hooked to news cycles , \u201d she added .

Distract yourself from alarming headlines\n\nIf you\u2019re a relatively young, long-term investor, don\u2019t even look at your account balance, or the week\u2019s stock-market plunge.

Take time to evaluate your budget\n\nMany Americans would do well to examine their budgets \u2014 if they even have a budget at all, according to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at the personal-finance website Bankrate.com. About two-thirds of American adults don\u2019t even have one, according to the polling firm Gallup.

But both aren\u2019t always readily available, in which case the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Anne Marie Helmenstine, who holds a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences, posted a tutorial online for how to make it. It may take your mind off the plunge in the stock markets, although some health experts say homemade versions may not be very effective. Here are the ingredients and equipment you would need:\n\n2/3 cup 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) or ethanol\n\n1/3 cup aloe vera gel\n\n8-10 drops essential oil, optional (such as lavender, vanilla, peppermint, grapefruit)\n\nBowl and spoon\n\nFunnel\n\nRecycled liquid soap or hand sanitizer bottle\n\n4. Check-in with elderly family and community members\n\nThe elderly appear to be more prone to contracting the new coronavirus. \u201cBut some haven\u2019t even heard about it,\u201d said Amy Goyer, a family and care-giving expert for AARP. \u201cFor others, that\u2019s all they\u2019re listening to.\u201d It\u2019s a good idea to call seniors and get a feel for where they stand, she said. \u201cAs the virus spreads it\u2019s more and more important to be in touch with people who are isolated,\u201d Goyer said. \u201cThey may think this is minor and may not get themselves checked out.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to act like we\u2019re in the middle of a huge crisis,\u201d according to Goyer, who has written three books on care giving.

Organize your finances and pay off debt\n\nFully 18% of people who earn more than $100,000 say they live paycheck to paycheck, according to a survey released last month of 8,000 workers by global advisory firm Willis Towers Watson. \u201cThere\u2019s a high correlation between high pay \u2014 and living in a high-cost area and having an advanced degree,\u201d Shane Bartling, the senior director for retirement for the firm, explains of why so many people making a chunk of change say they\u2019re still living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nDo you have a student loan, or even some credit-card debt?

Even paying student-loan debt, which typically has lower rates, can guarantee a better return than the market can at times, she said.\n\nRecommended: Will coronavirus spread throughout the U.S.? We can all learn from the missteps during those critical, early days in China\n\n7. Amp up your retirement investing\n\nHave you signed up for a retirement account? There\u2019s no time like the present. Many employed Americans don\u2019t have a retirement account at all. If there\u2019s room in your budget, you can also amp up the amount you contribute to your 401(k) in order to get a contribution match from your employer, if it offers one. For those who don\u2019t have 401(k) accounts at work, it can be fast to sign up online for a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. They allow you to save while receiving tax benefits for doing so.\n\n\u201c Nearly one quarter of the investors in the 401(k) plans managed by Fidelity Investments said they were overinvested in stocks versus recommended levels. \u201d\n\nFidelity Investments, a major manager of company retirement plans, recently estimated that 23% of the investors in the 401(k) plans it manages were overinvested in stocks compared to their recommended levels, including 7% who had their entire 401(k) plan in the stock market. Among baby boomers, who are near or in retirement, 38% were overinvested in stocks, and 8% were entirely invested in the stock market.\n\nIdeally, you will \u201cmaximize contributions to your IRA, 401(k), or 403(b).

The tax-free compounding of these retirement accounts is strong magic for your income at retirement time.\u201d\n\n8. Open a higher-interest savings account\n\nMany traditional banks offer low interest rates on savings accounts, but there are several online banks offering higher rates to consumers.Consumers holding an emergency fund in cash could be earning more than they are currently, he said, and setting up an online account can take only a few minutes. Look for a savings account that pays a greater than 2% annual percentage yield. On that note, some financial writers recommend CIT Bank CIT, -2.99% and Citizens Access, an offshoot of Citizens Bank, Marcus by Goldman Sachs GS, +2.05% , Synchrony and Barclays.\n\nResearch from TD Ameritrade \u2014 which looks at people who save 20% or more of their incomes, called \u201csuper savers\u201d \u2014 shows that the single biggest difference between what super savers spent less on, as compared with the rest of us, was housing.

Celebrate your strengths, fix your financial flaws\n\nIn less than 15 minutes, you can find out just how financially healthy you are by taking a financial capability quiz. Questions like: Could you come up with $2,000 if an unexpected need arose within the next month? May prompt you to adhere to a stricter budget, especially if you or your partner has to take time off work because of illness.\n\nOne rule of thumb: dedicate 80% of your spending budget to necessities like rent, utilities and 20% for fun splurges like concerts and clothing, according to Northwestern Mutual. A fear-driven rush to sell stocks amidst coronavirus concerns may ignore the less obvious underlying problems in your portfolio. \u201cAre your investments appropriate for your age?\u201d or \u201cAre you sensibly diversified?\u201d may help you regain a sense of control over your emotional and financial health.\n\n10. Finally, explore the art of meditation\n\nClosing your eyes and taking deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth won\u2019t pay your bills, create a magical bump in the stock market, and it certainly won\u2019t act as a preventative measure against coronavirus. But it can help you restore a calm mind set to make more rational decisions. There are free apps such as Smiling Mind and one designed by UCLA\u2019s Mindful Awareness Research Center.
