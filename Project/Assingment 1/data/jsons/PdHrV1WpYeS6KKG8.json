But on Wednesday , Trump told reporters : \u201c We \u2019 ve asked for it \u2026 if it exists \u201d \u2013 before adding that it \u201c probably does \u201d exist .\nTrump had previously suggested he believes the denials of responsibility from the Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , and warned against a rush to judgement .\nOn Wednesday evening , the Washington Post published Khashoggi \u2019 s final column for the paper under the headline Jamal Khashoggi : What the Arab world needs most is free expression . Karen Attiah , the global opinions editor , wrote in an introduction : \u201c I received this column from Jamal Khashoggi \u2019 s translator and assistant the day after Jamal was reported missing in Istanbul . The Post held off publishing it because we hoped Jamal would come back to us so that he and I could edit it together . Now I have to accept : That is not going to happen . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , Trump denied he was covering up for the Saudi royals but at the same time pointed to their importance as strategic and commercial partners .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not giving cover at all . And with that being said , Saudi Arabia has been a very important ally of ours in the Middle East . We are stopping Iran , \u201d he told reporters .\nBut Trump \u2019 s defence of the Saudi royals has become increasingly difficult as Turkish government leaks and press reports have revealed more details about the grisly nature of Khashoggi \u2019 s fate and the involvement of Saudi operatives close to the Saudi crown prince .\nThe evidence , if confirmed , would also undermine any Saudi attempt to claim that Khashoggi \u2019 s death was the result of an interrogation gone wrong , carried out by rogue elements in the Saudi intelligence and security services . Multiple reports have suggested that Riyadh was contemplating putting out a narrative along those lines .\nPlay Video 1:10 ' I do n't want to talk about any of the facts ' : Mike Pompeo on Jamal Khashoggi case \u2013 video\nAccording to an account in the pro-government daily newspaper Yeni \u015eafak , and a later report citing Turkish officials by the New York Times , the audio recording proves that Khashoggi was seized as soon as he entered the office of the Saudi consul , Mohammad al-Otaibi , on 2 October .\nThe dissident journalist was beaten and had his fingers cut off , according to the news account . Otaibi asked for the torture to be done outside his office , saying : \u201c You will put me in trouble . \u201d\n\u201c If you want to live when you come back to Arabia , shut up , \u201d the consul was told by a Saudi hit team who had flown to Istanbul hours before Khashoggi \u2019 s planned visit to the consulate , where he had expected to pick up legal papers he needed to get married .\nKhashoggi was beheaded and his body was cut up . A Saudi forensics specialist Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy can be heard putting on headphones to listen to music and telling others to do the same while the body was dismembered , according to the reports .\nInvestigators believe that after the killing , Khashoggi \u2019 s body was taken to the consul general \u2019 s house , where it was disposed of .\nPolice set up barricades outside the residence on Tuesday evening to carry out a planned search of the premises . Under the Vienna convention , diplomatic premises are considered foreign soil and Turkey needed the Saudis \u2019 agreement . Turkish and Saudi investigators eventually entered the residence on Wednesday evening , according to reports .\nOn Thursday a Reuters witness said Turkish crime scene investigators had left the consulate itself after searching the premises and consular vehicles . During the inspection bright lights were used to illuminate the consulate \u2019 s garden , in what was the second search there this week .\nOtaibi , the consul general , has not been seen in public since the scandal erupted and is said to have left Turkey on a commercial flight to Riyadh on Tuesday .\nIt is unclear how the Turkish authorities obtained audio recordings of the murder , but officials have briefed multiple news organisations on their macabre contents .\nThe US secretary of state , Mike Pompeo , initially refused to say whether he had heard the recordings at meetings at Istanbul airport on Wednesday morning with President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Turkish foreign minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu .
