    "content": "For the last couple of years , the conventional wisdom has been that the Republican Party potential presidential field was an embarrassment of riches . Their `` bench '' was so chock full of executive talent , they barely had room for them all . This was always discussed in the context of the Democratic Party 's sad little group of ancient mariners who might well have already been set on the ice floe in an earlier time .\nIt 's interesting how that 's unfolding . None of the governors are panning out . Texas Governor Rick Perry , whose record running one of the biggest state 's successfully on a Republican platform was no help , dropped out first ; followed by the union slaying Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker . Both had been highly touted as excellent presidential material based on their records . None of the current and former governors , from Bush to Kasich , Christie , Huckabee , Jindal and Pataki , have caught fire either . Between them , they have decades of executive experience and yet they ca n't get any momentum . This flies in the face of everything we 've ever heard about the Republican reverence for state government , for executive experience and the ability to get results from Republican policies .\nFor a long time it was assumed that Senators were unsuited for the task of the presidency , what with their lack experience `` running things . '' Not that this stopped them from running for president , but it had n't escaped anyone 's notice that until 2008 the last Senator to become president had been elected in 1960 . Barack Obama broke that long streak and the Republicans have a handful of Senators to choose from in 2016 . Two of the four in the race , Rubio and Cruz , seem to be doing slightly better than the governors , and are at this point seen as `` establishment '' alternatives , even though neither of them are polling at more than 11 percent . The third , Rand Paul , once touted as the leader of a new libertarian , isolationist Republican Party , has turned out to be irrelevant . The fourth , Senator Lindsay Graham , is a joke .\nThere you have the vaunted GOP bench -- the well-prepared , highly qualified , totally experienced group of veterans , any one of whom the country was supposed to be able to see as president . And Republican primary voters ca n't stand any of them . They are , instead , enthralled with two men who have never held public office , and seem not to even understand our system of government or care how it works .\nThe Hill asked some Republican strategists to explain this phenomenon :\n\u201c It \u2019 s a different test this time around , \u201d said GOP strategist David Payne . \u201c Experience , executive experience , these aren \u2019 t the tests .
