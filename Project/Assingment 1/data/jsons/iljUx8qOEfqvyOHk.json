But although Rock \u2019 s comments on racism initially drew the most attention , a recent study from Gregory Clark , a researcher at University of California , Davis , has got me thinking that the comedian \u2019 s most insightful ( and potentially radical ) statement came earlier in the interview , during a brief digression about inequality . \u201c Oh , people don \u2019 t even know , \u201d he said , responding to Rich \u2019 s claim that class was still \u201c the elephant in the room \u201d of American politics . \u201c If poor people knew how rich rich people are , \u201d he continued , \u201c there would be riots in the streets . \u201d\nAt first blush , this may not sound like such a profound statement ; it could be easily mistaken for a comment about the politics of envy or simply the awesome scale of inequality today . But I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s what Rock was getting at , really . Rather than speaking to the reality of inequality itself or the combustible resentment of the underclass , Rock was talking about our perception of American society , and how that perception influences politics . That \u2019 s why , in his next remark , he expanded beyond the poor to \u201c the average person. \u201d They too , he said , would also be outraged and bewildered by the lifestyle of the 1 percent . \u201c If the average person could see the Virgin Airlines first-class lounge , \u201d Rock said , \u201c they \u2019 d go , \u2018 What ?

Multiple studies have shown that Americans seriously underestimate the degree of inequality in the U.S. economy .

Moreover , the same study shows that even if the wealth of the U.S. economy was distributed like they \u2019 d believed , most Americans would still consider it too unequal .
