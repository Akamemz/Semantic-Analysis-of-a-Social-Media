Nor did he suggest , as President Barack Obama often did , that Muslim countries are unlikely to wipe out extremism until they reform their economies and political systems so their people have ways to address their grievances , to participate in governing , to obtain an education and jobs .\nMr. Trump chose instead to single out Iran , the leading Shiite-majority state and Saudi Arabia \u2019 s main enemy , as a threat because of its support for militias in Lebanon and Yemen and for its backing of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria . Many of Iran \u2019 s activities are indeed destabilizing ; but Mr. Trump \u2019 s friend Vladimir Putin has been no less responsible for keeping Mr. Assad in power .\nIn some ways Iran is an easy political target . Sunni Arabs feel threatened by Iran and are competing with Iran for regional influence . Israel detests Iran and so do many members of Congress . Yet to see Iran as implacably hostile is much too simple . Even as Mr. Trump reaffirmed America \u2019 s partnership with the conservative Saudi royals , Iranians were re-electing a moderate , Hassan Rouhani , as president and reaffirming their interest in engagement with the West .\nWhile Mr. Trump was explicitly not lecturing Sunni Arab leaders on human rights , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson responded to the Iranian election by advising Mr. Rouhani to restore the rights of Iranians to freedom of speech and organization . The Saudi human rights record is no better than Iran \u2019 s .",
