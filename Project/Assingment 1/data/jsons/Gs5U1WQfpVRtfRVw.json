But , of course , it \u2019 s not clear how much access to cannabis we \u2019 ll have as the shutdown goes on .\nIn response to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 callout , hundreds of people across the country and in Canada told us how they were getting their cannabis products , how supply has changed , how their dealers have changed the process of buying , and whether they \u2019 re worried about future supply as the quarantine goes on . We also received a number of replies from dealers in different cities who either are ramping up sales due to high demand or have stopped selling entirely because they can \u2019 t do so safely . ( In fact , thanks to me tweeting repeatedly about this story and looking for dealers who wanted to talk , my inbox now has a number of emails asking for leads on new dealers from people who lost theirs .

For people in larger cities , they can still access the products they need \u2014 just with stringent rules . In cities where weed is legal , only a certain number of customers can enter the dispensary at a time , meaning there are often long lines queued up outside . In cities where it \u2019 s illegal , dealers are often refusing cash and only taking Venmo , and not allowing customers to touch any of the product except what they buy . These rules are reasonable \u2014 and are likely going to become more and more customary \u2014 for the time we \u2019 re living in , but they \u2019 re not what you usually associate with inviting a stranger over to your home and rummaging through their backpack before choosing a treat for yourself . What \u2019 s clear , at least , is that the shutdown has only made people want to buy even more weed during our collective endless , unwanted staycation . No better time than now , when we have literally nothing to do but sit and wait , to ride out life with a blunt . As one dealer said , \u201c Do you have any idea how many people would hate me if I stopped right now ? \u201d\nI would be remiss if I didn \u2019 t mention that smoking weed , especially right now , isn \u2019 t a great idea for your health .

The complications that come with coronavirus \u2014 tightening in your chest , trouble breathing \u2014 could be made worse if you \u2019 re a regular smoker .\nBut coronavirus notwithstanding , some people still need cannabis products for their health during this time . Whether it \u2019 s for pain management for cancer treatments , anxiety , depression , PTSD management , or just to while away the seemingly infinite hours that we \u2019 re all trapped in our own homes , the demand for weed has skyrocketed in the last few weeks .
