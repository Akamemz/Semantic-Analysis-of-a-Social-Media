    "content": "In just about seven weeks , people will be able to start buying Obamacare-approved insurance plans through the new health care exchanges . But already , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is predicting those plans , and the whole system of distributing them , will eventually be moot . Reid said he thinks the country has to \u201c work our way past \u201d insurance-based health care during a Friday night appearance on Vegas PBS \u2019 program , Nevada Week in Review . \u201c What we \u2019 ve done with Obamacare is have a step in the right direction , but we \u2019 re far from having something that \u2019 s going to work forever , \u201d Reid said . When then asked by panelist Steve Sebelius whether he meant ultimately the country would have to have a health care system that abandoned insurance as the means of accessing it , Reid said : \u201c Yes , yes . Absolutely , yes. \u201d The idea of introducing a single-payer national health care system to the United States , or even just a public option , sent lawmakers into a tizzy back in 2009 , when Reid was negotiating the health care bill .\nThe truth , from a man best known for his shameless lying\nThere 's no need to fret about Obamacare 's myriad implementation meltdowns and broken promises , Reid explains ; after all , everyone knows the new law is n't `` going to work forever . '' Now they tell us . The Left evidently plans to bide its time , allow their own interim law to wither on the vine , then swoop in with an ingenious `` new '' plan : Even more government control . Sure , many Americans may suffer in the meantime , but true compassion is measured by the advancement of Statist policies , so Obamacare-caused pain can be chalked up as collateral damage for the cause . It is astonishing to watch Reid breezily admit that Obamacare is unsustainable as its full implementation looms , especially since the Senate Majority Leader might have likened you to a supporter of slavery for making such a claim while Obamacare was being debated . Now that it 's the law and the moment of truth is approaching , of course we 'll have to move away from an insurance-based system one of these days . Kudos to the Obamacare minions for keeping a straight face while reciting their `` you can keep your existing plan '' talking points , knowing full well that their end goal is to outlaw said existing plans . Obamacare is a costly , inefficient , harmful means to an end . And if you ( understandably ) do n't want to take Reid 's word for it , listen to the candid assessments of his leftist brethren :\nAs the debate over Obamacare played out , conservatives who merely pointed out that Barack Obama was once a vocal advocate for a government-owned-and-operated healthcare system were tarred as vicious smear merchants . How dare we repeat Obama 's own words ?\nImagine if Paul Ryan had given a speech circa 2003 , in which he confessed that he `` happened to be a proponent of ending Medicare altogether . '' Might that soundbyte have effectively ended his future fair-minded efforts to reform the broken program ? And might the Left 's hyperbolic attacks have been even more unhinged than this ? Those are rhetorical questions . In any case , as average Americans try to survive the Obamacare era , they can rest assured that their rulers will soon return with an improved plan to fashion the nation 's healthcare system to more closely reflect Great Britain 's panacea -- at which point , the Left 's sliming of conservatives over single-payer worries will instantly morph from `` that 's not our goal , you paranoid wingnuts ! '' to `` why do you want these children to die ? '' By the way , Reid 's been on a roll recently . He 's engaged in ugly concern trolling about the root cause of GOP opposition to Obama 's agenda , `` hoping '' that it 's not based on the president 's skin color ( this from Mr. `` Negro Dialect '' ) , and compared the Tea Party to pre-World War One anarchists ( this from a leader of the Occupy-aligned political party ) . And since casual defamation seems to be in vogue , has anyone conclusively disproven persistent rumors about Reid 's personal proclivities ? The `` word 's out , '' Harry .",
