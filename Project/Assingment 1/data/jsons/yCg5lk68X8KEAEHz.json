In that group , his lead over Mitt Romney \u2014 12 points \u2014 is about half of what it is among 25- to 29-year-olds , according to an online survey this spring by the Harvard Institute of Politics . And among whites in the younger group , Mr. Obama \u2019 s lead vanishes altogether .\nAmong all 18- to 29-year-olds , the poll found a high level of undecided voters ; 30 percent indicated that they had not yet made up their mind . And turnout among this group is expected to be significantly lower than for older voters .\n\u201c The concern for Obama , and the opportunity for Romney , is in the 18- to 24-year-olds who don \u2019 t have the historical or direct connection to the campaign or the movement of four years ago , \u201d said John Della Volpe , director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics . \u201c We \u2019 re also seeing that these younger members of this generation are beginning to show some more conservative traits . It doesn \u2019 t mean they are Republican . It means Republicans have an opportunity . \u201d\nExperts say the impact of the recession and the slow recovery should not be underestimated . The newest potential voters \u2014 some 17 million people \u2014 have been shaped more by harsh economic times in their formative years than by anything else , and that force does not tend to be galvanizing in a positive way .\nFor 18- and 19-year-olds , the unemployment rate as of May was 23.5 percent , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . For those ages 20 to 24 , the rate falls to 12.9 percent , compared with the national unemployment rate of 8.2 percent for all ages . The impact of the recession on the young has created a disillusionment about politics in general , several experts suggested .\n\u201c I think the lack of excitement right now is palpable enough to be a challenge to the re-election campaign \u201d of Mr. Obama , said Peter Levine , director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University .\nThe Romney campaign intends to seize the moment , with new online and campus-based initiatives rolling out in the next few weeks , said Joshua Baca , the campaign \u2019 s national coalition director .
