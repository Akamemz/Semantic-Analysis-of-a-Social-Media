    "content": "The transformative nature of President Trump 's election in 2016 -- by way of a unique coalition of support -- had given Republicans a degree of optimism heading into a challenging midterm election season . Though the president has historically low approval ratings nationally , he is still overwhelmingly popular among the party 's base , which includes voters Trump lured away from the Democrats .\nBut as Democrats discovered over the past few elections with Barack Obama as president , star power does n't necessarily trickle down . If anything , it fuels and unites the opposition . Now , after losing a congressional district Tuesday that Trump had won by 20 points , the GOP faces a similar reckoning .\nDemocrat Conor Lamb 's apparent defeat of Rick Saccone in a Western Pennsylvania district that combines steel country with the suburbs , comes on the heels of Democrats winning a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama for the first time in a quarter-century . Trump endorsed the Republican candidate in both cases . He visited Pennsylvania twice to tout his agenda and tie it to Saccone , who ran as an ally of the president . Trump 's son Don Jr. told voters during a campaign stop earlier this week that `` everything [ my father ] stands for and represents for the future '' would be on the ticket .\nRepublicans say Trump 's visit was helpful , and argue that Saccone was a uniquely weak candidate and Lamb as a uniquely strong one .
