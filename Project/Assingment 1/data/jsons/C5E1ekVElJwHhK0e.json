But it did so at a cost , which he had to have seen coming : It focused most of the attention on where and how he was protesting , rather than on his underlying cause . The main defense offered by Kaepernick \u2019 s partisans on the left amounts to gleefully blaming Americans who reacted to this protest in completely predictable ways for their reaction . Which is more or less the opposite of what you do if you are trying to persuade people to change or improve something about the country they love . It is , instead , how you behave if what you want is a fight .\nOf course , that Kaepernick chose to make this a fight about the nation \u2019 s unifying symbols doesn \u2019 t excuse President Trump , and now Vice President Pence , for throwing gasoline on the fire in a way that only makes Democrats more likely to continue treating these symbols as mere partisan emblems of the Republican tribe . Trump in particular managed to revive the controversy after Kaepernick \u2019 s inability to find a new job in the NFL had mostly stilled the waters ; the president \u2019 s rant induced a whole lot of NFL players who were not protesting the anthem to protest the president \u2019 s demand that a fellow player be fired . Naturally , Trump \u2019 s insertion of himself into the drama only further drew the issue away from Kaepernick \u2019 s original cause .\nPence \u2019 s response Sunday was more temperate , as usual \u2014 he didn \u2019 t call anybody an SOB or demand that anyone be fired \u2014 and would have been better-received if Trump hadn \u2019 t escalated the situation . But it still fanned further fires under the controversy after Puerto Rico and Las Vegas had driven it from the front pages , and stomped all over a day in Indianapolis honoring Peyton Manning to boot . Pence \u2019 s move may have been politically savvy , given how the fight has played out , but it was a depressing spectacle nonetheless and drove politics still deeper into the world of sports .\nIn contrast to the American flag , the Confederate flag and other symbols of the rebellion have always been divisive , meaning dramatically different things to different people . There \u2019 s a strong likelihood that anyone trying to make a political cause from the Confederate flag or Confederate statues or memorials today is looking to create racial division by picking at very old scabs . Focusing on 19th-century symbols , when there are so many bigger things going on in the world , is a sign of seriously misplaced priorities . That goes for the people exercised about tearing them down , and it goes as well for the people looking to make hay from defending them , such as Minnesota transplant Corey Stewart , who recently lost a primary bid for the Virginia governorship . It surely goes for the 30 idiots marching in Charlottesville on Saturday .\nHere \u2019 s the obvious problem : To most African-Americans , Confederate symbols can \u2019 t be separated from the centrality of slavery to the Confederate cause or from the later use of those symbols by defenders of Jim Crow who stood in the doorway blocking integration and equal civil rights . That should be reason enough for any American in 2017 to reconsider waving the Confederate flag or trying to raise new monuments honoring the \u201c Lost Cause. \u201d As Jay Nordlinger has argued at length , we shouldn \u2019 t be in the business today of whitewashing the awful truth of what the Confederacy was about . Yet when we move from the flag to the old statues \u2014 when we leave behind promoting symbols and focus on tearing them down \u2014 a number of polls have found that even black Americans are at best split around 50/50 on removing those statues , while a clear majority of all Americans are opposed . Why ?\nMaybe because ordinary Americans understand what pundits pretend not to : Confederate symbols have more than one meaning , and have for some time , and trying to force people to change their minds about the meaning of ancestral symbols and history is one of the most unproductive ways possible to approach the project of improving society . Teach your kids the truth , but let the past lie where it fell .\nThe perspective of the victors in any just war is memorably set forth in Winston Churchill \u2019 s great and underrated speech of July 4 , 1918 \u2014 poignant in retrospect \u2014 about Germany in World War I :\nWe are all erring mortals . No race , no country , no individual , has a monopoly of good or of evil , but face to face with the facts of this war , who can doubt that the struggle in which we are engaged is in reality a struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil ? It is a struggle between right and wrong , and as such it is not capable of any solution which is not absolute . Germany must be beaten ; Germany must know that she is beaten ; Germany must feel that she is beaten . Her defeat must be expressed in terms and facts which will , for all time , deter others from emulating her crime , and will safeguard us against their repetition . But , Ladies and Gentlemen , the German people have at any rate this assurance : that we claim for ourselves no natural or fundamental right that we shall not be obliged and even willing in all circumstances to secure for them . . . . Whatever the extent of our victory , these principles will protect the German people . The Declaration of Independence and all that it implies must cover them . . . . No compromise on the main purpose ; no peace till victory ; no pact with unrepentant wrong . . .\nThe necessity of demonstrating both the completeness and the justice of defeat is important ; it ultimately failed in Germany after 1918 , but for all the failures of Reconstruction , it succeeded , if fitfully , in the South after 1865 . The South never again took up arms in any organized fashion against the North \u2014 nobody has tried secession since \u2014 and it did not rise again until it fully embraced the Union . That practical acceptance of defeat , emulating the example of Robert E. Lee \u2019 s surrender , was important ; it avoided a further war of annihilation against white southerners and laid the foundation for the growth of the nation to a prosperous world power in steady stages from 1865 to 1945 .\nIn the interim , two things happened that still echo in our fights over symbols . One was the development of the \u201c Lost Cause \u201d myth , the popular southern history that sought to recast the \u201c War Between the States \u201d as a noble and principled struggle that was nearly won and slipped away due to a series of ill-starred missed chances . The other event in parallel , of course , was the imposition through force and terror of Jim Crow , a comprehensive legal and social system of white supremacy throughout the former Confederacy .\nToday , we have what might be called the \u201c Lost Lost Cause \u201d myth .\nToday , we have what might be called the \u201c Lost Lost Cause \u201d myth : the progressive notion that the two were inseparable , that the \u201c Lost Cause \u201d mythology glorifying the Confederacy as a noble effort served no possible or conceivable purpose besides propaganda for the restoration of white supremacy . In this view , Reconstruction was a noble and principled struggle that was nearly won and slipped away , due mainly to the refusal of the former Confederates to accept defeat . In the modern progressive telling , any commemoration of the Confederacy was a plot to subjugate freed black Americans . But the \u201c Lost Lost Cause \u201d myth , like the myth it seeks to supplant , is incomplete in its effort to erase from past and present the human reality of white southerners over the past century and a half . That matters in particular when it comes to understanding the statues .\nThe literature and statuary of the Lost Cause was hardly the monolith on issues of slavery and race that the progressives would have you believe . Some were horrifyingly blunt about framing the war as a defense of white supremacy . But many others \u2014 indeed , much of the official history taught in southern public schools for decades \u2014 went to great and implausible lengths to claim that the war was about everything but slavery . That would scarcely have been necessary if not for the unstated recognition that a more respectable justification was needed to ennoble the bloodshed .\nThe chief item of evidence trotted out in the statue debate is the timeline of the erection of monuments . A widely cited Southern Poverty Law Center \u201c study \u201d declares :\nThe dedication of Confederate monuments and the use of Confederate names and other iconography began shortly after the Civil War ended in 1865 . But two distinct periods saw significant spikes . The first began around 1900 as Southern states were enacting Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise African Americans and re-segregate society after several decades of integration that followed Reconstruction . It lasted well into the 1920s , a period that also saw a strong revival of the Ku Klux Klan . The second period began in the mid-1950s and lasted until the late 1960s , the period encompassing the modern civil rights movement .\nSimilar studies are offered , frequently with major omissions , regarding public displays of the rebel flag . There is undoubtedly some truth in this , especially as regards the resurgence of memorial-building in the 1950s and \u2019 60s . But it suffers both from the tendency to reduce white southerners to one-dimensional cartoons and the chronic progressive obsession with hunting for some syllogism that can be used to declare , as if by mathematical proof , that no possible good-faith opposing argument could ever exist .\nThe southern need to salvage something of which to be proud from the wreckage of the war was misguided , and it was turned at times to bad uses , but it was not inherently malicious . Nearly all of the manhood of the Confederacy was mobilized in the war , and somewhere in the neighborhood of 250,000 men died for the Confederate cause . Another 200,000 or so more were wounded , many of them crippled or maimed for life . Hundreds of thousands of families felt those losses directly . The economic losses were even more widespread , including not just the destruction of the unjust plantation system and Sherman \u2019 s trail of destroyed infrastructure but also the economic isolation that would plague the region as a whole for decades ( partly due to the self-inflicted wound of Jim Crow ) .\nGiven the great sacrifices made by ordinary people for the cause , the search for some way to honor them is not at all surprising , and does not require one to assume a vast conspiracy to justify Jim Crow . Studies like the SPLC \u2019 s generally fail to measure southern memorial-building against the obvious control group : Union memorials of the same war .\nIn fact , there is a natural rhythm to a society \u2019 s commemoration of wars . There is typically a wave of monuments and memorials during the war and in the immediate aftermath , when the veterans come home and the dead are freshly buried . The second wave tends to arrive when the veterans are a gray and fading generation honored by their children and grandchildren . And those memorials are often , as in the case of the Confederacy , monuments to the generals as a proxy for the more numerous men who bled and died under their command .\nConsider , in our own time , the commemoration of World War II . Twenty-five years after the war ended , the children of the men who fought it were chanting \u201c don \u2019 t trust anyone over 30 \u201d ; 50 years after the war ended , they were re-christening their fathers \u201c the Greatest Generation \u201d and flocking to see Saving Private Ryan . The National World War II Memorial in Washington was commissioned in 1993 , 48 years after the end of the war , and opened in 2004 .\nThe same dynamic followed the American Civil War . On the Union side , the Gettysburg battlefield was first memorialized four months after the battle , including Lincoln \u2019 s famous address there , and both sides began building the first memorials after the war ( Maryland erected a Confederate memorial in 1884 , but few others followed ) . Inevitably , the next wave followed when the veterans were old and gray . One of the signature events , in the case of the Civil War , was the 1913 reunion of over 50,000 veterans at Gettysburg , including more than 8,000 Confederate veterans , and that era was when most of the Confederate memorials were built at Gettysburg .\nThe driver of this timeline was the fact that the leaders of the day were men whose aging and departing fathers had fought for the Confederacy .\nThe timing explanation is especially strained in application to the 1910s and 1920s , an era when white supremacy was already deeply entrenched in the old Confederacy and outside pressure was minimal ( especially during the openly racist presidency of Woodrow Wilson , the Democratic founder of modern progressivism ) . Yet that \u2019 s when many of the Confederate monuments went up . The SPLC \u2019 s own data shows by far and away the largest spike in the early teens . A reasonable person who was not in the thrall of an ideological crusade would recognize that the driver of this timeline was the fact that the generation of southern political , social , and economic leaders of the day were men whose aging and departing fathers had fought for the Confederacy .\nThe 75th anniversary of Gettysburg , in 1938 , attracted almost 2,000 veterans from the two sides , a remarkable number given that their average age was 94 . At that event , acknowledging the national goal of putting the war to rest , President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed the gathering and unveiled the Eternal Light Peace Memorial , dedicated to lasting peace among the two contending sides . As I \u2019 ve noted before , the \u201c two contending sides \u201d narrative was incomplete : By focusing only on North vs. South , it left black southerners out of the picture . But we shouldn \u2019 t use that omission to pretend that white southerners \u2019 effort to honor their own fathers and grandfathers was some sort of charade , or that the nation didn \u2019 t need to find some way to be magnanimous enough in victory to let the defeated have their own monuments . The question , instead , is how to move beyond the old monuments into a future where black Americans are an equal part of the story .\nIt wasn \u2019 t really so long ago that Democrats , carrying the political project of liberalism and the uniform support of African-Americans , nonetheless recognized their own electoral need to throw a purely symbolic bone here and there to people who still valued the Confederate symbols . Bill Clinton himself , as governor of Arkansas , went out of his way to commemorate the Confederacy by signing a bill in 1987 specifically noting that \u201c the blue star above the word \u2018 ARKANSAS \u2019 is to commemorate the Confederate States of America. \u201d In 2005 , the Democrats made their national chairman Howard Dean , who had professed in 2003 that \u201c I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. \u201d Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s own father helped dedicate Confederate statues when he was mayor of Baltimore . The turn of liberals like Pelosi against those symbols now feels less like a genuine indictment of men like Pelosi \u2019 s father than a lashing-out at voters who stopped supporting Democrats .\nIn my lifetime , the first big effort to nationalize the issue of Confederate symbols , back in 2000 , was a ginned-up liberal panic over George W. Bush pulling ahead in the South Carolina primary . Bush had been the furthest thing from a racially polarizing governor of Texas and was conspicuously descended from a long line of New Englanders , but after he spoke to several thousand students at the controversial Bob Jones University , the media tried to drag him into the ongoing state controversy over the Confederate flag on state property .\nAs I \u2019 ve detailed at length before , however , the partisan politics of the Confederate flag in South Carolina were still complex in 2000 . The prior Republican governor , David Beasley , had proposed a compromise to move the flag off the state capitol dome \u2014 where it had been raised in 1961 by Democratic governor Fritz Hollings , who served in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat until 2005 \u2014 to a less prominent site . Beasley was defeated in 1998 by Democrat Jim Hodges , a Bill Clinton comrade who sat silent as his allies pounded Beasley for taking on the flag . Hodges , after cashing his electoral winnings , later endorsed Beasley \u2019 s plan ; he signed it into law after his media allies were done beating up Bush . Naturally , however , liberal Democrats outside the South making the issue into a national partisan and cultural lightning rod made it radioactive for years after that .\nSouth Carolina didn \u2019 t really change its mind about the symbol , so much as somebody else tried to make an issue of it and lost : the Charleston church shooter .\nSouth Carolina \u2019 s flag was finally brought down entirely by Republican governor Nikki Haley in 2015 . South Carolina didn \u2019 t really change its mind about the symbol , so much as somebody else tried to make an issue of it and lost : the Charleston church shooter . Just as Haley recognized that the rebel flag needed to come down once it became the rallying cause for a mass murder , and just as the symbol of the \u201c Ground Zero Mosque \u201d needed resisting when it was explicitly targeted for the site of mass murders committed by fanatics in the name of Islam , the embrace of the Lee statue in Charlottesville in connection with the murder of a protestor likewise calls for it to be taken down now , to prevent it from being a rallying point for such people in the future .\nTaking that flag down was nonetheless overdue . But flags and statues are different ; flags are active symbols , raised and lowered daily , while statues reflect not only what \u2019 s been commemorated but a record of the people who did the commemorating . Of course , when a society throws off tyranny or occupation , statues may well be torn down in a political statement of contempt \u2014 this happened at the end of Communism , and also when an American mob tore down the George III statue in Lower Manhattan , ultimately melting it down into bullets . But the history of iconoclastic furies against the past , from the Protestant Reformation to the Taliban dynamiting the Bamiyan Buddhas in early 2001 , is full of mob rages that led to atrocities . We shouldn \u2019 t court that spirit lightly .\nGoing forward , there may well be some statues that should , with mature reflection , be taken down or relocated . I \u2019 m partial myself to removing standalone monuments to Jefferson Davis and John C. Calhoun , the political theorists and leaders of rebellion rather than military commanders ; Davis in 1865 and after was the most conspicuous example of a Confederate leader who refused to accept that the South was beaten or should be beaten . Nathan Bedford Forrest , too , deserves close scrutiny for his foundational role in the KKK . In some cases , as was done in New Orleans in the early \u2019 90s , the better path may be to keep statues in place while removing offensive inscriptions . At the opposite end of the spectrum is Stone Mountain , Ga. , with its enormous bas-relief ( the largest in the world ) of Davis , Lee , and Stonewall Jackson . Stone Mountain is an artistic achievement in its own right , and it would likely be destroyed or mutilated in any effort to remove it , as Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has demanded . That would be a sad replay of what the Taliban did to the Buddhas . A wholesale eradication of Confederate statuary would eliminate the value of picking and choosing the worst offenders to single out .\nCivil rights and equality are typically advanced by appeals to empathy and the things we share in common , and by isolating the kinds of extremists who marched in Charlottesville . That requires confrontation at times , but starting divisive battles over symbols is about the most counterproductive approach possible . America \u2019 s national symbols matter and mean something , and they should not be lightly dragged into partisan controversy . The Confederacy \u2019 s symbols , by contrast , are best left to their place in the past . Picking fights over either is the mark of an unserious time , one in which we \u2019 re more interested in offending people for its own sake than in making this a better world for everyone to live in .",

August\u2019s controversy around the removal of Confederate statues also resurfaced, as about 30 \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d losers returned to Charlottesville Saturday to protest the planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth fights are ultimately about the power of symbols. In each case, the original push to pick a fight came from the Left and was followed by a reaction from the Right. Symbols evoke powerful emotions, yet controversies around them tend to generate a lot of division without accomplishing anything tangible.\n\nThe trouble with symbols is that they have a history, and history can\u2019t be changed overnight by any amount of reason or good will. Policies may change, laws may change, but history is always with us, and pulling it up by the roots invariably means digging deeper than we expect. The history of iconoclasm suggests that the result is more often bloodshed than reform.\n\nThe Unifying Flag\n\nLet\u2019s start with a commonsense rule: Whoever picks the fight over symbols is the one who has the explaining to do.

His stated cause was to protest cases in which police weren\u2019t criminally convicted for killing African-Americans, but from the outset, he framed it as a broad-brush indictment of America under Barack Obama:\n\n\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d\n\nWith Kaepernick\u2019s wealth and celebrity, he could have picked any number of venues for his protest. By his own admission, he picked the flag and anthem to demonstrate his inability to show pride in his country. He even went so far as to defend Fidel Castro, a man who ran a brutal police state with a distinct record of racism against black Cubans, suggesting that policing isn\u2019t his real problem with America.\n\nThe choice of the flag and anthem was as deliberately provocative as Kaepernick\u2019s rhetoric. Lots and lots of Americans have an emotional, non-ideological connection to the flag and anthem as unifying symbols of America, its people (all of them), its history, and its ideals. That includes all the things conservatives love about this country and all the things liberals love about this country. The fact of our ideological, partisan, and tribal divisions only emphasizes the importance of the few symbols of national unity that transcend those divisions. America stands for pluralism; you have a legal right to protest the flag, but by doing so, you stand outside of that common commitment to the values of a nation where other people less privileged than you have that right, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaepernick knew all this before he picked his target. He isn\u2019t some red-diaper baby from Berkeley, or the product of a forsaken ghetto cut off from the rest of our society. He grew up in Turlock, in California\u2019s Central Valley, even today a modestly Republican and still very Middle America part of the state. He knew full well how much the national symbols mean to most Americans, and that targeting those symbols would bring out opposition, even from people who might have listened to his specific grievances if they hadn\u2019t been bundled with a message of \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag\u201d that represents America.\n\nLeft-wing memes have offered analogies to Kaepernick\u2019s protest.

Focusing on 19th-century symbols, when there are so many bigger things going on in the world, is a sign of seriously misplaced priorities. That goes for the people exercised about tearing them down, and it goes as well for the people looking to make hay from defending them, such as Minnesota transplant Corey Stewart, who recently lost a primary bid for the Virginia governorship. It surely goes for the 30 idiots marching in Charlottesville on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the obvious problem: To most African-Americans, Confederate symbols can\u2019t be separated from the centrality of slavery to the Confederate cause or from the later use of those symbols by defenders of Jim Crow who stood in the doorway blocking integration and equal civil rights. That should be reason enough for any American in 2017 to reconsider waving the Confederate flag or trying to raise new monuments honoring the \u201cLost Cause.\u201d As Jay Nordlinger has argued at length, we shouldn\u2019t be in the business today of whitewashing the awful truth of what the Confederacy was about. Yet when we move from the flag to the old statues \u2014 when we leave behind promoting symbols and focus on tearing them down \u2014 a number of polls have found that even black Americans are at best split around 50/50 on removing those statues, while a clear majority of all Americans are opposed. Why?\n\nMaybe because ordinary Americans understand what pundits pretend not to: Confederate symbols have more than one meaning, and have for some time, and trying to force people to change their minds about the meaning of ancestral symbols and history is one of the most unproductive ways possible to approach the project of improving society. Teach your kids the truth, but let the past lie where it fell.\n\nThe perspective of the victors in any just war is memorably set forth in Winston Churchill\u2019s great and underrated speech of July 4, 1918 \u2014 poignant in retrospect \u2014 about Germany in World War I:\n\nWe are all erring mortals. No race, no country, no individual, has a monopoly of good or of evil, but face to face with the facts of this war, who can doubt that the struggle in which we are engaged is in reality a struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil? It is a struggle between right and wrong, and as such it is not capable of any solution which is not absolute. Germany must be beaten; Germany must know that she is beaten; Germany must feel that she is beaten. Her defeat must be expressed in terms and facts which will, for all time, deter others from emulating her crime, and will safeguard us against their repetition. But, Ladies and Gentlemen, the German people have at any rate this assurance: that we claim for ourselves no natural or fundamental right that we shall not be obliged and even willing in all circumstances to secure for them. . . . Whatever the extent of our victory, these principles will protect the German people. The Declaration of Independence and all that it implies must cover them. . . . No compromise on the main purpose; no peace till victory; no pact with unrepentant wrong . . .\n\nThe necessity of demonstrating both the completeness and the justice of defeat is important; it ultimately failed in Germany after 1918, but for all the failures of Reconstruction, it succeeded, if fitfully, in the South after 1865. The South never again took up arms in any organized fashion against the North \u2014 nobody has tried secession since \u2014 and it did not rise again until it fully embraced the Union. That practical acceptance of defeat, emulating the example of Robert E. Lee\u2019s surrender, was important; it avoided a further war of annihilation against white southerners and laid the foundation for the growth of the nation to a prosperous world power in steady stages from 1865 to 1945.\n\nIn the interim, two things happened that still echo in our fights over symbols. One was the development of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d myth, the popular southern history that sought to recast the \u201cWar Between the States\u201d as a noble and principled struggle that was nearly won and slipped away due to a series of ill-starred missed chances. The other event in parallel, of course, was the imposition through force and terror of Jim Crow, a comprehensive legal and social system of white supremacy throughout the former Confederacy.\n\nToday, we have what might be called the \u201cLost Lost Cause\u201d myth.\n\nToday, we have what might be called the \u201cLost Lost Cause\u201d myth: the progressive notion that the two were inseparable, that the \u201cLost Cause\u201d mythology glorifying the Confederacy as a noble effort served no possible or conceivable purpose besides propaganda for the restoration of white supremacy. In this view, Reconstruction was a noble and principled struggle that was nearly won and slipped away, due mainly to the refusal of the former Confederates to accept defeat. In the modern progressive telling, any commemoration of the Confederacy was a plot to subjugate freed black Americans. But the \u201cLost Lost Cause\u201d myth, like the myth it seeks to supplant, is incomplete in its effort to erase from past and present the human reality of white southerners over the past century and a half. That matters in particular when it comes to understanding the statues.\n\nThe literature and statuary of the Lost Cause was hardly the monolith on issues of slavery and race that the progressives would have you believe. Some were horrifyingly blunt about framing the war as a defense of white supremacy. But many others \u2014 indeed, much of the official history taught in southern public schools for decades \u2014 went to great and implausible lengths to claim that the war was about everything but slavery. That would scarcely have been necessary if not for the unstated recognition that a more respectable justification was needed to ennoble the bloodshed.\n\nA Time for Mourning\n\nThe chief item of evidence trotted out in the statue debate is the timeline of the erection of monuments. A widely cited Southern Poverty Law Center \u201cstudy\u201d declares:\n\nThe dedication of Confederate monuments and the use of Confederate names and other iconography began shortly after the Civil War ended in 1865. But two distinct periods saw significant spikes. The first began around 1900 as Southern states were enacting Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise African Americans and re-segregate society after several decades of integration that followed Reconstruction. It lasted well into the 1920s, a period that also saw a strong revival of the Ku Klux Klan. The second period began in the mid-1950s and lasted until the late 1960s, the period encompassing the modern civil rights movement.\n\nSimilar studies are offered, frequently with major omissions, regarding public displays of the rebel flag. There is undoubtedly some truth in this, especially as regards the resurgence of memorial-building in the 1950s and \u201960s. But it suffers both from the tendency to reduce white southerners to one-dimensional cartoons and the chronic progressive obsession with hunting for some syllogism that can be used to declare, as if by mathematical proof, that no possible good-faith opposing argument could ever exist.\n\nThe southern need to salvage something of which to be proud from the wreckage of the war was misguided, and it was turned at times to bad uses, but it was not inherently malicious. Nearly all of the manhood of the Confederacy was mobilized in the war, and somewhere in the neighborhood of 250,000 men died for the Confederate cause. Another 200,000 or so more were wounded, many of them crippled or maimed for life. Hundreds of thousands of families felt those losses directly. The economic losses were even more widespread, including not just the destruction of the unjust plantation system and Sherman\u2019s trail of destroyed infrastructure but also the economic isolation that would plague the region as a whole for decades (partly due to the self-inflicted wound of Jim Crow).\n\nGiven the great sacrifices made by ordinary people for the cause, the search for some way to honor them is not at all surprising, and does not require one to assume a vast conspiracy to justify Jim Crow. Studies like the SPLC\u2019s generally fail to measure southern memorial-building against the obvious control group: Union memorials of the same war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, there is a natural rhythm to a society\u2019s commemoration of wars. There is typically a wave of monuments and memorials during the war and in the immediate aftermath, when the veterans come home and the dead are freshly buried. The second wave tends to arrive when the veterans are a gray and fading generation honored by their children and grandchildren. And those memorials are often, as in the case of the Confederacy, monuments to the generals as a proxy for the more numerous men who bled and died under their command.\n\nConsider, in our own time, the commemoration of World War II. Twenty-five years after the war ended, the children of the men who fought it were chanting \u201cdon\u2019t trust anyone over 30\u201d; 50 years after the war ended, they were re-christening their fathers \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d and flocking to see Saving Private Ryan. The National World War II Memorial in Washington was commissioned in 1993, 48 years after the end of the war, and opened in 2004.\n\nThe same dynamic followed the American Civil War. On the Union side, the Gettysburg battlefield was first memorialized four months after the battle, including Lincoln\u2019s famous address there, and both sides began building the first memorials after the war (Maryland erected a Confederate memorial in 1884, but few others followed). Inevitably, the next wave followed when the veterans were old and gray. One of the signature events, in the case of the Civil War, was the 1913 reunion of over 50,000 veterans at Gettysburg, including more than 8,000 Confederate veterans, and that era was when most of the Confederate memorials were built at Gettysburg.\n\nThe driver of this timeline was the fact that the leaders of the day were men whose aging and departing fathers had fought for the Confederacy.\n\nThe timing explanation is especially strained in application to the 1910s and 1920s, an era when white supremacy was already deeply entrenched in the old Confederacy and outside pressure was minimal (especially during the openly racist presidency of Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic founder of modern progressivism). Yet that\u2019s when many of the Confederate monuments went up. The SPLC\u2019s own data shows by far and away the largest spike in the early teens. A reasonable person who was not in the thrall of an ideological crusade would recognize that the driver of this timeline was the fact that the generation of southern political, social, and economic leaders of the day were men whose aging and departing fathers had fought for the Confederacy.\n\nThe 75th anniversary of Gettysburg, in 1938, attracted almost 2,000 veterans from the two sides, a remarkable number given that their average age was 94. At that event, acknowledging the national goal of putting the war to rest, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed the gathering and unveiled the Eternal Light Peace Memorial, dedicated to lasting peace among the two contending sides. As I\u2019ve noted before, the \u201ctwo contending sides\u201d narrative was incomplete: By focusing only on North vs. South, it left black southerners out of the picture. But we shouldn\u2019t use that omission to pretend that white southerners\u2019 effort to honor their own fathers and grandfathers was some sort of charade, or that the nation didn\u2019t need to find some way to be magnanimous enough in victory to let the defeated have their own monuments. The question, instead, is how to move beyond the old monuments into a future where black Americans are an equal part of the story.\n\nFlags and Statues\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really so long ago that Democrats, carrying the political project of liberalism and the uniform support of African-Americans, nonetheless recognized their own electoral need to throw a purely symbolic bone here and there to people who still valued the Confederate symbols. Bill Clinton himself, as governor of Arkansas, went out of his way to commemorate the Confederacy by signing a bill in 1987 specifically noting that \u201cthe blue star above the word \u2018ARKANSAS\u2019 is to commemorate the Confederate States of America.\u201d In 2005, the Democrats made their national chairman Howard Dean, who had professed in 2003 that \u201cI still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.\u201d Nancy Pelosi\u2019s own father helped dedicate Confederate statues when he was mayor of Baltimore. The turn of liberals like Pelosi against those symbols now feels less like a genuine indictment of men like Pelosi\u2019s father than a lashing-out at voters who stopped supporting Democrats.\n\nIn my lifetime, the first big effort to nationalize the issue of Confederate symbols, back in 2000, was a ginned-up liberal panic over George W. Bush pulling ahead in the South Carolina primary. Bush had been the furthest thing from a racially polarizing governor of Texas and was conspicuously descended from a long line of New Englanders, but after he spoke to several thousand students at the controversial Bob Jones University, the media tried to drag him into the ongoing state controversy over the Confederate flag on state property.\n\nAs I\u2019ve detailed at length before, however, the partisan politics of the Confederate flag in South Carolina were still complex in 2000. The prior Republican governor, David Beasley, had proposed a compromise to move the flag off the state capitol dome \u2014 where it had been raised in 1961 by Democratic governor Fritz Hollings, who served in the U.S. Senate as a Democrat until 2005 \u2014 to a less prominent site. Beasley was defeated in 1998 by Democrat Jim Hodges, a Bill Clinton comrade who sat silent as his allies pounded Beasley for taking on the flag. Hodges, after cashing his electoral winnings, later endorsed Beasley\u2019s plan; he signed it into law after his media allies were done beating up Bush. Naturally, however, liberal Democrats outside the South making the issue into a national partisan and cultural lightning rod made it radioactive for years after that.\n\nSouth Carolina didn\u2019t really change its mind about the symbol, so much as somebody else tried to make an issue of it and lost: the Charleston church shooter.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s flag was finally brought down entirely by Republican governor Nikki Haley in 2015. South Carolina didn\u2019t really change its mind about the symbol, so much as somebody else tried to make an issue of it and lost: the Charleston church shooter. Just as Haley recognized that the rebel flag needed to come down once it became the rallying cause for a mass murder, and just as the symbol of the \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d needed resisting when it was explicitly targeted for the site of mass murders committed by fanatics in the name of Islam, the embrace of the Lee statue in Charlottesville in connection with the murder of a protestor likewise calls for it to be taken down now, to prevent it from being a rallying point for such people in the future.\n\nTaking that flag down was nonetheless overdue. But flags and statues are different; flags are active symbols, raised and lowered daily, while statues reflect not only what\u2019s been commemorated but a record of the people who did the commemorating. Of course, when a society throws off tyranny or occupation, statues may well be torn down in a political statement of contempt \u2014 this happened at the end of Communism, and also when an American mob tore down the George III statue in Lower Manhattan, ultimately melting it down into bullets. But the history of iconoclastic furies against the past, from the Protestant Reformation to the Taliban dynamiting the Bamiyan Buddhas in early 2001, is full of mob rages that led to atrocities. We shouldn\u2019t court that spirit lightly.\n\nGoing forward, there may well be some statues that should, with mature reflection, be taken down or relocated. I\u2019m partial myself to removing standalone monuments to Jefferson Davis and John C. Calhoun, the political theorists and leaders of rebellion rather than military commanders; Davis in 1865 and after was the most conspicuous example of a Confederate leader who refused to accept that the South was beaten or should be beaten. Nathan Bedford Forrest, too, deserves close scrutiny for his foundational role in the KKK. In some cases, as was done in New Orleans in the early \u201990s, the better path may be to keep statues in place while removing offensive inscriptions. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Stone Mountain, Ga., with its enormous bas-relief (the largest in the world) of Davis, Lee, and Stonewall Jackson. Stone Mountain is an artistic achievement in its own right, and it would likely be destroyed or mutilated in any effort to remove it, as Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has demanded. That would be a sad replay of what the Taliban did to the Buddhas. A wholesale eradication of Confederate statuary would eliminate the value of picking and choosing the worst offenders to single out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCivil rights and equality are typically advanced by appeals to empathy and the things we share in common, and by isolating the kinds of extremists who marched in Charlottesville. That requires confrontation at times, but starting divisive battles over symbols is about the most counterproductive approach possible. America\u2019s national symbols matter and mean something, and they should not be lightly dragged into partisan controversy. The Confederacy\u2019s symbols, by contrast, are best left to their place in the past. Picking fights over either is the mark of an unserious time, one in which we\u2019re more interested in offending people for its own sake than in making this a better world for everyone to live in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCan the NFL Survive National Polarization\n\nThe Glass House of the NFL\n\nThe Spiritual Side of the National Anthem Protests",
