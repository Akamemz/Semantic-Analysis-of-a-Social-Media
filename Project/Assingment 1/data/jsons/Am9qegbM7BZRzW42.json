Each respondent was given a gap score based on the number of scale positions separating the two ratings.

Respondents who rate their own views and those of their community the same were scored a zero.\n\nThe resulting gap between the respondent's ideology and their perception of the dominant ideology of people in their local area is used to define whether a respondent feels they live in an ideologically similar or dissimilar environment.\n\nRepublicans are the most likely to perceive their ideology as being similar to those in their community, while Democrats are least likely to do so.\n\nWith gap scores of zero to one, most Republicans (61%) and independents (53%) perceive little to no difference between their personal ideological convictions and the prevailing views of people in their area. Slightly less than half of Democrats (47%) perceive the same symmetry.\n\nIn contrast, with gaps of four or more points, 21% of Democrats believe they live in an area where residents hold significantly different ideological beliefs from their own.

Those who perceive a moderate ideological gap are nearly as likely to say the same (75%). A more significant drop in a sense of belonging occurs among respondents who perceive a large ideological gap, with 62% saying they feel \"very\" or \"somewhat\" attached.
