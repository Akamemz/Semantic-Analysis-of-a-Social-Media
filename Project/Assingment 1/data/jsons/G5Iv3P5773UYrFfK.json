Ted Cruz said Saturday .\n`` It has the potential of having a huge impact on the fiscal strength of our country , '' the Texas Republican told economist Larry Kudlow on his WABC radio show , while admitting that it will be complicated to solve the issues surrounding Medicaid expansion .\n`` There are not only ideological differences , but parochial differences '' among Republicans from different states , Cruz explained . `` You have some of the states that have expanded Medicaid , other states have not , and no senator wants to see their state get the short end of the stick . ''\nAt any rate , it is going to take some time before the Senate has a bill ready to return to the House , Cruz said .\n`` I think it was a positive step of the House this week to reach an agreement and vote the repeal bill out , '' Cruz told Kudlow . `` In the Senate , we have a difficult task ahead of us . We have a very narrow majority , just 52 Republicans , and need at least 50 to pass the bill . ''\nAs the matter is a `` deliberative process , '' it could take several weeks or even a `` couple of months '' before the Senate returns a bill to the House , and if that does n't happen , it would prove `` catastrophic . ''\n`` For seven years the Republicans have been promising , 'If only you elect us , we \u2019 ll repeal ObamaCare , ' `` Cruz told Kudlow.v `` I think the consequences of failure would be catastrophic . But it \u2019 s going to take senators across the Republican conference being willing to sit down in good faith . ''\nThe main key , said Cruz , is finding a way to lower insurance premiums .\n`` If you look at under Obamacare , the average family 's premiums have risen over $ 5,000 a year , '' the senator said . `` That 's the main reason people are so furious with Obamacare . ''\nThe first and most important way to lower the premium costs is to roll back Title I mandates included in Obamacare .\n`` There are 12 Title I mandates in Obamacare , '' said Cruz . `` The original House bill repealed only two of them and kept in place 10 of the 12 insurance mandates . That 's the main reason so many conservatives were displeased with the first version , because it did n't drive down premiums . The compromise that was reached in the House between conservatives and moderates , between the Freedom Caucus and leadership , allows states to opt out . ''\nOther key steps would allow the purchase of insurance across state lines , creating a `` true 50-state marketplace , '' allowing people in small markets or individuals to join together in large groups to get better rates , letting people pay their insurance premiums through their health savings accounts , and looking for proposals for tort reform , said Cruz .\nObamacare , he continued , is the `` single biggest jobs killer in this country , '' and changes to the insurance law will also boost the nation 's economy , said Cruz .\n`` I do small business roundtables all over the state of Texas and sit down over and over and over again , with small business owners , and I 've never done a small business roundtable when at least half of the small business owners around the table did n't list Obamacare as the single biggest challenge that they face in their business , '' said Cruz . `` We 've got to fix that and I think in time once we come together and come to consensus I hope and believe that 's what we are going to do .
