    "content": "On April 2 in Tulsa , Oklahoma , a sheriff 's deputy named Robert Bates shot and killed Eric Harris , a man fleeing a crime scene where he was about to be captured for selling illegal weapons . Bates , a reserve deputy who is allowed to work on cases because he is a big donor to the sheriff 's office , was charged this week with second-degree manslaughter , after claiming that he meant to reach for a taser and not a gun .\nAs Harris lay struggling and dying , he told the surrounding officers , \u201c I \u2019 m losing my breath. \u201d One officer yelled back at him , \u201c Fuck your breath ! \u201d Then he insisted that the dying man be handcuffed .\n\u201c Fuck your breath ! \u201d encapsulates in only three words the systemic disregard that police regularly show to Black people in America . Just last week , we watched Michael Slager execute Walter Scott in South Carolina for daring to run away . Now this week , we are also tuning into the trial of former Chicago Police Officer Dante Servin , who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd in March 2012 . In the cases of Eric Garner in Staten Island , Tamir Rice in Cleveland , Walter Scott in South Carolina , and Eric Harris in Tulsa , we have seen video of law enforcement officers not only critically injuring citizens but also refusing to administer medical care , with fatal consequences .\nGiven the origins of policing in this country and their connections to slave patrols and other forms of racialized social control , I am under no illusions that the police have ever held Black life in high regard . Police complicity and participation in lynchings and in the KKK make that clear . But the explicit , tacit refusal of Black people \u2019 s right to breathe is still significant . The fact that the Tulsa County Sheriff 's Office is a pay-to-play force is significant . The fact that white men can sign up with government approval for the right to play cops and robbers on the weekends is appalling . That Black lives provide fodder for state-sanctioned sport should have us in the streets .\nThere is something about the logics of self-governance under the terms of neoliberalism that make this moment feel more pessimistic than our trite narrative of linear progress on racial issues would have us conclude . In 2012 , the United Arab Emirates gave $ 1 million to the New York City Police Foundation . According to an NYPD spokesperson , the money was used to upgrade equipment and aid in criminal investigations . In both New York City and Tulsa , private funding of law enforcement significantly impacts the way local policing is done . In Tulsa , it results in the pay-to-play scheme . In New York City , it allows for large infusions of cash donations whose specific uses do not come under public scrutiny because they are private funds .\nThese forms of neoliberal policing -- in which private citizens and private monies impact the culture of policing but escape governmental checks and balances -- endanger us all .\nIn New York , such actions enable the purchase of unspecified forms of \u201c equipment \u201d that might , for instance , be used to exacerbate the culture of militarized policing in the NYPD . Part of this money allows the NYPD to travel to the UAE to learn counterterrorism measures . In the wake of 9/11 , some external training might be helpful , but essentially , this sounds like a case of the NYPD being allowed money to play global cops and robbers , and to then test out these tactics on the Black and Brown people who are policed heavily within the city .\nIn the case of Tulsa , this privately underwritten form of law enforcement placed an underprepared \u201c pretend \u201d deputy into a serious confrontation . As a result , Eric Harris lost his life .\nBut he did not just lose his breath . As he lay dying , he was refused the right to breathe . That refusal came in a chorus of other taunts about how he was getting what he deserved because he chose to run . His breath seeped out of his Black body as public service officers taunted him in a barrage of profanity .\nWhy is the refusal of breath to Black people endemic to the American condition ? What about the Black body makes the life-breath that we all hold so dear \u2014 so sacred \u2014 such a profane and devalued thing in the hands of white people ?\nIn 1977 , the famous writer and American prophet James Baldwin returned to America after living in France for more than three decades . In an interview at the New York Times , he said :\n`` I left America because I had to . It was a personal decision . I wanted to write , and it was the 1940 's , and it was no big picnic for blacks . I grew up on the streets of Harlem , and I remember President Roosevelt , the liberal , having a lot of trouble with an anti- lynching bill he wanted to get through the Congress -- never mind the vote , never mind restaurants , never mind schools , never mind a fair employment policy . I had to leave ; I needed to be in a place where I could breathe and not feel someone 's hand on my throat . \u201d\nBaldwin names a moment that sounds similar to our own . The vote is insecure from racial tampering . Indiana has just passed legislation that allows businesses ( including eateries ) to discriminate against customers based on \u201c religious \u201d assessments of their fitness to be served .

Under this kind of logic , the supposed lack of control of working-class Black and Brown people justifies the stultifying overpolicing of our communities , the stranglehold of our prison system saddling Black people with jail time , fines , probation , parole and a constant sense of threat , and finally , the ultimate refusal of one \u2019 s breath by a trigger-happy police officer if you fail to submit in any way to this unjust state of affairs .\nSomething must change .
