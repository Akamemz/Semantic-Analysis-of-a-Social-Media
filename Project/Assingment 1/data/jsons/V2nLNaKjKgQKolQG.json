They both have two young daughters . They both served in the Senate for only two years before defying conventional wisdom and declaring their lofty White House ambitions .\nThe similarities may well stop there for Obama and Cruz , who at 44 is just one year younger than Obama when he launched his improbable presidential bid eight years ago .
