    "content": "People trust the \u201c unbiased \u201d internet search giant Google so much it can actually influence up to 10 million undecided voters to choose Hillary Clinton for president , prominent US psychologist and author Robert Epstein told RT following years of research .\nDespite being a supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee , Dr. Epstein believes Google \u2019 s unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a \u201c threat to democracy . \u201d\nRT : Robert , how did you discover that Google is possibly in cahoots with the Clinton campaign ?\nRE : Well I didn \u2019 t find out that they were necessarily supporting Hillary Clinton , that \u2019 s not what I found at first . First , through several years of research , I found that they had the power to control elections , the power to shift the votes . So , that was more than four years of experimental research with more than 10,000 people in 39 countries .\nSo , we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings Google can shift a lot of votes . More than 20 percent of undecided voters overall , and in some demographic groups up to 80 percent of undecided voters . People trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples \u2019 votes .\nNow , more recently , many people have established that Google has a very close relationship with Hillary Clinton . That didn \u2019 t come from my research , that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people .\nRT : Are you going to take a look at Facebook and Twitter as well ? It looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates .\nRE : Well , we know now that Facebook has the power to shift about 600,000 votes to Hillary Clinton on Election Day with no one knowing this is occurring . All they have to do is send out \u201c Go out and vote \u201d reminders to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s supporters , but not to Trump \u2019 s supporters . That would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home . So yes , we \u2019 ve looked at Facebook , we \u2019 ve looked at Twitter . But again , Facebook can shift 600,000 votes , Google can shift somewhere between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes .\nRT : Have you been able to find abnormal search results by Google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections ?\nRE : We haven \u2019 t look carefully at too many countries . We \u2019 ve looked at the UK election in 2015 , we looked at the national election in India , at the Lok Sabha election in 2014 . What we do know is that it is the nature of Google \u2019 s algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another . That happens automatically . That happens , as Google would say , organically . So , this means that Google \u2019 s algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years , probably actually controlling the winner in as many as 25 percent of the national elections of the world .\nRT : What do you think about this threat of big data ? Do you think Google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose ?\nRE : Well , big data at the moment is a threat . It \u2019 s a threat to democracy , at least as we have it in the United States , it \u2019 s a threat to human freedom , it \u2019 s a threat to civil liberties . This is mainly because the technologies are very new , and new means of control , of surveillance , of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated \u2013 they \u2019 re not covered by any laws or regulations . So , the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly , and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies , we \u2019 ve not developed systems for regulating these technologies . Obviously , we must do so .\nRT : You \u2019 ve said that unlike Europe , Russia and China were able to overcome the Google monopoly , but a lot of people are still using this search engine . Do you think that the US company can manipulate public opinion in Russia as well ?\nRE : Well , it \u2019 s hard for them to manipulate opinion if they don \u2019 t dominate that country . Google dominates most of the countries in the world . The only countries it doesn \u2019 t dominate are Russia and China . So , Russia and China are protected a little bit from Google , but Russia and China have their own problems . Russia has Yandex , China has Baidu , and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that Google is using and perhaps they \u2019 re already using these techniques . These techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine . These techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions .\nMy newest research shows , for example , that Google seems to be favoring Hillary Clinton in its search suggestions , the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item , and from new research I \u2019 ve done , we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate , that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate . So , Google is not the only problem . Any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance , for manipulation , for control , and I think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world , not just Google .\nRT : How do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like Google ?\nRE : Well , the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public . The private company does not have people who we voted on . The private company might be run almost like a monarchy , with the CEO having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do , even not having access to their internal records . So we would have no idea of exactly what they \u2019 re doing or how they \u2019 re doing it and how they \u2019 re making decisions . This is potentially very dangerous . The situation right now is unprecedented in human history . There has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws , beyond the reach of any regulations , and who don \u2019 t necessarily have the public interest in mind .\nRT : What about Donald Trump ? In your opinion , what methods and tricks has Donald Trump and his loyal media used in this presidential race ?\nRE : Well , I \u2019 ve said in writing , repeatedly and in many interviews that I \u2019 m a very strong supporter of Hillary Clinton . Hillary Clinton is by far the better candidate , Donald Trump is a very weak candidate , he would not make a good leader , he would not make a good president . Plus , I know people in his family , it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president , I don \u2019 t think he wants to be president ! I think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network , and I think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that .\nThe private company might be run almost like a monarchy , with the CEO having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do , even not having access to their internal records . So we would have no idea of exactly what they \u2019 re doing or how they \u2019 re doing it and how they \u2019 re making decisions . This is potentially very dangerous .\nI made a prediction on Twitter recently , you can check this : I not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show . It will be a reality TV show about Donald Trump running for president , and that will be a hit show , so I think that \u2019 s his only interest here . Hillary Clinton will become our next president , it \u2019 s guaranteed and in my opinion Donald Trump has no interest , never had any interest in becoming president .\nRT : Do you believe that Hillary Clinton will become US president through the manipulation of public opinion ?\nRE : Oh , Hillary Clinton is guaranteed to win this election , and I have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote , that those polls did not take into account the power that Google and other companies have to shift votes . That \u2019 s missing from these polls . So , once you realize the power that these companies have , Hillary Clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win , and she will win in the margin of somewhere between 2.6 million and 10 million votes . If we take the mean , the average of those two numbers , I guess you could say it \u2019 s pretty clear that she will win by approximately 6.5 million votes .\nRT : Given that the United States has such an expensive and powerful media industry , would you say that voters in the US have a real picture of the presidential campaign ?\nRE : Well , voters in the United States I think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers , magazines and the internet , more than 400 different television channels . So I think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things , but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive . So , we \u2019 re getting one perspective from one magazine , another perspective from another magazine .\nBut when you come to something like Google , there \u2019 s no competition . There \u2019 s no competitor . It \u2019 s a completely different kind of influence , it \u2019 s non-competitive . In other words , if you \u2019 re still trying to make up your mind and you go to Google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election , Google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily , easily tip your opinion one way or the other and there \u2019 s no competitor , there \u2019 s no way for anyone to compensate what Google just told you .\nSo , this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence . It has no competition , there \u2019 s no corrective for it , and people trust Google \u2013 we know this from surveys \u2013 people trust Google more than they trust any newspaper , any magazine or any television station . People trust information that they get from a computer much more than information they \u2019 re getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased , because they know that people are actually giving them the information . But when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial , that information is objective and of course , that \u2019 s not really true , but that \u2019 s what people believe .",
