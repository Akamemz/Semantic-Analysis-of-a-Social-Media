Adam Schiff of California has said the behavior of President Donald Trump is not how democracy is supposed to work . But Mr. Trump has presented himself as a president bent on unblocking a Washington \u201c system \u201d that \u2019 s trying to frustrate the will of millions of \u201c real \u201d Americans .\nAcross the Atlantic , as an impeachment inquiry intensifies , the debate is strikingly similar to that in Britain .\nIn Britain , Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to pull the country out of the European Union by the end of this month , leading to a historic showdown with Parliament .

But the holding of a referendum in 2016 on Brexit has allowed Mr. Johnson to argue his approach truly expresses the popular will .\nCrises in two of the world \u2019 s leading democracies are prompting sharp debate over what democracy looks like \u2013 or what it should look like \u2013 in a world in which nationalism and populism are on the rise , and where confidence in existing institutions has been on the wane .\n\u201c This is what democracy looks like ! \u201d Those six simple words have emerged as the rallying call for countless political protests worldwide in the past few years .\nBut if you put a question mark at the end , they go to the heart of a crisis facing two of the world \u2019 s leading democratic countries : the United States and Britain . In the U.S. , at immediate issue is the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump . In Britain , it \u2019 s the prospect of Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2019 s taking the country out of the European Union without any agreed-upon transition deal .\nBoth crises involve something even more fundamental : a clash of sharply divergent visions of government .
