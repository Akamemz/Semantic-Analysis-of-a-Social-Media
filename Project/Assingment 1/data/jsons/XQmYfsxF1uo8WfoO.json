Manafort 's name was at the top of most lists of possible targets . It was the follow-up revelation from Robert Mueller 's independent counsel team , however , that caught most of Washington by surprise .\nGeorge Papadopoulos - hardly a household name - had pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about his contacts with Russian nationals and connected individuals while he was serving as a foreign policy with the Trump campaign .\nWhere the Manafort indictment was somewhat expected and covered business dealings prior to his time as head of the Trump campaign , the Papadopoulos news sits at the heart of Mr Mueller 's investigation into possible Trump team collusion with Russia .\nHere are three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle . And lest we give the Manafort case short shrift , here are three more reasons why it could end up being even more explosive .\nPer details of the indictment and plea agreement , Papadopoulos has revealed that he was in contact with individuals - a London professor , a female Russian national , a Russian foreign affairs ministry official - either directly or tangentially connected to the Russian government .\nHe was passing along details of conversations he had to senior members of the Trump presidential campaign team including , reportedly , Manafort . At one point , a `` campaign supervisor '' , responding to one of Papadopoulos 's emails , replied `` good work '' .\nWhile not evidence of collusion , this is clear indication that the Russian government was seeking back channels to the Trump campaign - and were finding at least some success .\nThe White House has diminished Papadopoulos 's role within the campaign , noting he was an unpaid adviser and that his efforts to set up a senior-level meeting between the Trump team and Russian officials were rebuffed .\nPapadopoulos did have a sit-down conference on 31 March 2016 , with Mr Trump and the rest of the foreign policy team .
