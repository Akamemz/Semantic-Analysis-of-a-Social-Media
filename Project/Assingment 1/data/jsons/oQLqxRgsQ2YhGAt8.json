( Clearly he didn \u2019 t watch my show the last two Sundays . )\n\u201c They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them . Major lies written , then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed ... a stain on America ! \u201d\nNow those are tough words that tar the entire business with the same brush . But at some point you have to wonder whether , at a minimum , many outlets have set a lower bar for stories damaging to the president . There have been too many instances where they have rushed on the air or online with supposed revelations that don \u2019 t hold up .\nCNN \u2019 s recent mistake was a serious one because the premise of the story was completely invalidated . What was initially reported as an incriminating email to Donald Trump Jr. turned out to be nothing because CNN got the date wrong .\nThe much-touted exclusive\u2014also \u201c confirmed \u201d by CBS and MSNBC\u2014said that an unknown person had sent the president \u2019 s son an encryption key to view secret Wikileaks emails in September 2016 .\nBut the collusion allegation collapsed when it turned out the email was actually sent 10 days later , when the hacked DNC material had already been made public .\nCNN said it was taking no action against its reporter because two sources had provided bad information . But how exactly did two separate sources make the same mistake about the date ?\nAnd that doesn \u2019 t get the network off the hook , because it was making a sensational charge based on an email its reporter hadn \u2019 t seen . That is risky business .\nThus came the Trump tweet : \u201c Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday . They were caught red handed , just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News ( who should be immediately fired for his \u2018 mistake \u2019 ) . Watch to see if @ CNN fires those responsible , or was it just gross incompetence ? \u201d\nRoss , suspended by ABC for four weeks , also got a crucial date wrong . His original report said Trump had ordered Mike Flynn to make contact with the Russians during the campaign , which suggests collusion . But Trump actually directed Flynn to do so during the transition , as president-elect , when such diplomatic outreach would be routine ( except that Flynn lied about it to the FBI ) .\nLeaving aside the propriety of a president demanding the firing of individual journalists , I \u2019 m struck by Trump accusing CNN of a \u201c vicious and purposeful mistake. \u201d What news organization would intentionally make such an error , only to have to run a humiliating correction ?\nVirtually all journalists make mistakes .
