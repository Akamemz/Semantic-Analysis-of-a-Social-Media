    "content": "She is so excruciatingly , insufferably , painfully stupid , shallow , pandering , desperate , and without ethics .\nKirsten Gillibrand . United States Senator from New York . Candidate for 2020 Democrat Presidential nomination .\nShe was not initially on my radar . I follow the news like a hawk , but she always was so politically lightweight \u2014 make that bantamweight \u2014 that she did not register . Here in California , \u201c register \u201d is a term we often use for earthquakes . The Northridge shaker registered at 6.7 . A solid 3.5 , give or take , will wake you up . Gillibrand registers at 0.0 , give or take a zero .\nIt is not that I live amid a high bar for United States Senate excellence . Here in Orange County , the epicenter of The Resistance within the People \u2019 s Republic of California , reports reach us that we are represented by Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris . One slept her way from the bottom to the top . Everyone here knows that . She cavorted publicly with one Willie Brown , then California Democrat Kingmaker , even prompting Willie \u2019 s wife to castigate her in the same brazen open way that the affair itself was conducted . In a quote published by the famous San Francisco columnist Herb Caen in his book , Basic Brown , Mrs. ( Blanche ) Brown said on the eve of Willie being sworn in as Mayor of San Francisco :\n\u201c Listen , she may have him at the moment , but come inauguration day and he \u2019 s up there on the platform being sworn in , I \u2019 ll be the b * * * h holding the Bible . \u201d\nAs for our other U.S. Senate star , she spent nearly twenty years being chauffeured around by a spy for the Chinese government . Are you worried about collusion and leaks to foreign governments ? How about having a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence talking privately on her phone for two decades with no one else listening in \u2014 except for a spy planted there by China ? Many Americans outside the Golden Homeless State had the opportunity to witness for your own eyes and ears these two gems on full national display during Christine Blasey Perjury day . Dromedary and Bactrian . One hump and two humps . Dianne and Kamala .\nSo my exposure to Senate excellence does not set a high bar for Kirsten Gillibrand to transcend or even to ascend . And yet , as she endeavors to ascend , that is exactly the end on which she lands . Here is why :\nFor several years , The Dolt was in the House , representing a somewhat moderate , even conservative , Upstate New York theretofore Republican district . She won election in 2006 and retained office in 2008 by advocating conservative views . She supported the National Rifle Association . She even received a 100 % rating from the NRA . She opposed amnesty for Illegals . She even opposed issuing drivers \u2019 licenses to Illegals . She voted to withhold federal funds from Sanctuary Cities . She won the Republican district because news broke days before the election that her opponent , the incumbent GOP Congressman , was abusive to his wife and even \u201c knocked her around the house. \u201d The wife had phoned in a plea to 9-1-1 , and the tape ended up in the news just in time .\nThat is how democracy works . That is how our leaders emerge to lead us over the cliffs .\nGillibrand was a Clinton neophyte and sycophant . She traveled with them , campaigned for them , and they for her . They raised money for her . Despite everyone knowing about Bill Clinton \u2019 s history with Paula Jones , Kathleen Willey , Juanita Broaddrick , and Monica Lewinsky \u2014 among others \u2014 Gillibrand was only too eager to associate closely with Bill . And it paid off . When Hillary was named by Obama as Secretary of State , she had to give up her Senate seat . Gillibrand , an Utter Unknown in a field of possibilities that included Andrew Cuomo and Caroline Kennedy , nevertheless was named by New York Governor David Paterson to that vacated Clinton seat .\nGillibrand immediately ditched all her \u201c values \u201d and moved rapidly to the Left . As the Democrats moved even farther yet to the Left , she kept endeavoring to outpace them . When # MeToo erupted after Harvey Weinstein , Gillibrand played a leading role in demanding that Al \u201c Probing Fingers \u201d Franken resign from the Senate . To get more national attention as she ramped up her Presidential aspirations , she then turned on her Clinton patrons and excoriated Bill , saying that he should have resigned from the Presidency in light of all the times he abused women , culminating with Lewinsky . Yet such concerns never before had stopped Gillibrand from endorsing Clintons and bragging of their endorsements and of their fundraising for her during all the prior years , even though all of Clinton \u2019 s storied abuses of women had been world famous by then .\nIn other words , not only no deeply held personal values , but also no loyalties , just the brazen single-minded pursuit of fame and power .\nWhen she ran in New York for reelection to the Senate in 2018 , she was challenged whether she had eyes on the White House . She famously and publicly promised to serve a full six-year term in the Senate if elected . Yet only two months after her November reelection , she announced her Presidential exploratory committee and joined the Democrat Clown Car . Unlike Georgia Governor-Not-Elect Stacey Abrams , she was able to fit in .\nDuring the past many months , Gillibrand repeatedly has demonstrated two defining characteristics :\n2 . In the face of polling for months in the general vicinity of Zero-point-Zero , she will say absolutely anything , no matter how absurd ( assuming she is smart and realizes what she is saying , but is saying The Outrageous for news-making effect ) or outright just-plain-stupid ( assuming she actually means what she is saying ) .\nGillibrand is a strong supporter of the most vile bigot in America , Linda Sarsour , and likewise praises Sarsour \u2019 s close second in hate , Tamika Mallory . Gillibrand endorses them , seeks to be photographed with them , and wants the Democrat Left to associate the name of Kirsten Gillibrand with Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory . When Time magazine named those two Jew-hating racist bigots among America \u2019 s most influential people , Sen. Gillibrand amazingly personally authored the article . Sarsour openly thanks Gillibrand for \u201c work [ ing ] for us on the inside. \u201d Yet the same Gillibrand will throw around the insult \u201c Racist ! \u201d when describing others who are not politically correct . She even sees \u201c racism \u201d in being pro-life . But she endorses Sarsour and Mallory , whose catalogues of prejudice , bigotry , and hate against Jews , White people , and even White women are an open book .\nAlthough Gillibrand postures as a # MeToo activist , she has openly tolerated remarkable anti-female abuse in her own office , where she disregarded several women \u2019 s complaints and pleas to deal with one of Gillibrand \u2019 s closest long-time staffers , who repeatedly told \u201c rape jokes \u201d in the office , intimidated women sexually , and created a profoundly hostile workplace environment for women . Only after a woman staffer resigned over the severe and persistent abuse , and the story then broke in Politico , did Gillibrand act to contain the political fallout .\n2 . She Will Say Absolutely Anything to Register a Decimal\nGillibrand was a relative unknown when named United States Senator . As a Democrat United States Senator in New York , she can not lose reelection if she tries . But her Aught Nothingness is more manifest on the national stage . From the early weeks of her candidacy for the Democrat Presidential nomination , she has been unable to register . To get attention \u2014 any attention at all \u2014 she now will say anything that comes to her unscripted mind , no matter how absurd , no matter how really not smart . That is , no matter how objectively stupid . You be the judge : Absurd or Stupid ?\nThus , she has announced that , if elected , she will federally recognize a legal third-gender option , creating an \u201c X \u201d field on identification documents for people who don \u2019 t identify as male or female . Likewise , she will roll out new birth certificates , replacing \u201c mother \u201d and \u201c father \u201d with gender-neutral language \u201c to ensure that both members of a same-sex couple can secure their parental rights from the day their child is born. \u201d Absurd or Stupid ?\nShe tweeted : \u201c Our future is : / Female / Intersectional /\u2026 And we \u2019 re just getting started. \u201d For that , she got slammed all over Twitter . Remember : She is White . Rich . Non-Muslim . For years a friend of the tobacco lobby . And although she yet may change her gender to get another vote somewhere , meanwhile she is one of the two genders recognized in the Bible . She is not yet Muslim , though she works on the inside for Linda Sarsour . Tough to see how Instersectionalism raises her Presidential fortunes above Cory ( Black ) , Kamala ( female , Jamaican , Indian , weed smoker , sexually promiscuous when needed ) , Pete ( Gay ) , Julian Castro ( Hispanic ) , Andrew Yang ( Asian ) , Gov.-Non-Elect Stacey ( female , Black , non-stereotypically full-figured , not elected ) , and those of such ilk . Absurd or Stupid ?\nShecomparespro-life judges to racists and Jew-haters ( like , uh , Linda Sarsour ? Tamika Mallory ? ) . Absurd or Stupid ?\nStill hovering at Zero-point-Zero , she pledges to legislate giving $ 600 to every person to donate to a candidate . Absurd or Stupid ?\nSo she goes to a Gay Bar , wearing a rainbow-colored \u201c Love Is Brave \u201d T-shirt ( get it ? ) , and gets herself filmed sipping a drink at the bar , as though she does this all the time . A long weary day on the trail , so need to relax just a bit at Happy Hour at the Ol \u2019 Gay Bar . And then she waves at one of her many fans in the bar , assuming anyone there even recognized her and did not think instead that she was signaling a desire to be \u201c picked up \u201d or to \u201c pick up , \u201d and she yells : \u201c Gay Rights ! \u201d\nThink about that last one . Really , pause a moment . Can you imagine someone entering a kosher deli , wearing a T-shirt that says \u201c I Love Lukshin Kugel , \u201d eating a piece of gefilte fish with a sour pickle and rye bread , waving at people she does not know and yelling out down the room \u201c Jew Rights ! \u201d ? Seriously .\nI have been at a gay bar only once \u2014 at an awkward moment fifteen summers ago , when my wife and ten-year-old son were driving down to a world-famous Laguna Arts Fair , and we needed most assuredly to stop at a restroom . None of us ever before had been in any bar at all ( except a bar mitzvah\u2026 ) , and it was during the years before a Starbucks bathroom was available on every block . We did not want to enter a non-kosher restaurant for the pit stop because it might seem we would be entering to eat there , so we figured let \u2019 s just go in-and-out of the bar . As we entered , I made a bee-line for the men \u2019 s room . The first thing that seemed strange was that there was no door to the room \u2014 you could see in and out of the room . And then I saw something else in there that educated me rapidly beyond my yeshiva education . \u2019 Nuff said . I realized rapidly that I had entered a twilight zone that even Rod Serling never had imagined , and \u2014 although I had tried avoiding the non-kosher burger place down the block \u2014 I essentially just had brought my wife and young boy into a place that might as well have had that burger store \u2019 s sign : \u201c In-and-Out . \u201d\nSo there is Kirsten , Intersectionalist , tight \u201c Love Is Brave \u201d T-shirt . Music blaring so loud that no one can hear a thing . Sipping a drink at a bar , fake dancing in a kind of Elaine Benes way . Big inviting smile . And she waves her hand at someone and yells something inviting that no one can hear at the bar , except for the microphone her campaign has attached near her for her choreographed tweet . So tell me : What does a person there think , if not that she is looking for a \u201c date \u201d ? Invest five seconds of your life and watch this tweeted snippet . Absurd or Stupid ?\nKirsten Gillibrand will say absolutely anything to register a decimal . Even at a gay bar . To get a one-dollar donation , she will film how many tries at beer pong ? For every Robert O \u2019 Rourke video showing him getting a full-mouth cavity inspection or having his ear hairs cut , she can take Twitter and YouTube a notch even lower . In the year of the 23-and-Counting , Kirsten Gillibrand is the most vapid clown in the car .",
