Back in 2016 , the Obama Administration added sexual orientation language to an HHS rule , forcing faith-based groups to choose between their biblical beliefs on marriage or receiving federal money to serve their communities .\n`` This Administration is committed to doing rule-making right , and to removing regulatory barriers that prevent non-profits from doing what they do best\u2014serving the needy and vulnerable in their communities , '' according to this Senior White House Official . `` The Administration is also fully committed to preserving the religious freedom rights of faith-based organizations , and we are proud to announce this proposed rule today doing just that . ''\nSince the new rule would apply to only laws passed by Congress , that means faith-based groups would have to comply with the three main federal laws on equality : the 1964 Civil Rights Act , the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act . All of them protect citizens against religious discrimination but none of them mention sexual orientation .\nIn the days before President Obama left office , HHS added the controversial regulation with language covering sexual orientation . The Trump Administration rule would make that regulation null and void . Currently , if faith-based groups want to apply for federal funds , they must request a waiver from the Obama rule . The proposal , that will be announced Friday , is the first step in the regulatory process . There will be a time for public comment before it goes into effect . It is expected to be challenged in court .\nThis move should not come as a shock to those who have followed President Trump 's directives closely . The White House has moved to protect medical workers who , due to their religious beliefs , want to opt-out of procedures such as abortion and assisted suicide . They also took action to make sure religious businesses can choose to not enroll in health insurance plans that cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs .\nAs for protecting the rights of faith-based adoption and foster care providers , Trump has been very clear . At the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year in Washington , Trump gave a hint of things to come . `` My administration is working to ensure that faith-based adoption agencies are able to help vulnerable children find their forever families while following their deeply held beliefs , '' the president remarked . It 's a controversial issue as lawmakers , think tanks , and advocacy groups grapple over whether faith-based groups should be funded by the federal government if they choose not to place children in the homes of same-sex couples .\nWhat is n't controversial is that there is a foster care crisis in America \u2013 443,000 children are in foster care and about 100,000 are waiting to be adopted . For the last five years , the foster care crisis has continued to get worse . The Trump administration believes the new rule will make it easier for faith-based agencies to stay in business and with this crisis boiling over , that 's vital to the well being of hundreds of thousands of children .
