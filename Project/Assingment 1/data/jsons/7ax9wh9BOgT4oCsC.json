    "content": "During the early George W. Bush years , when a boy king seemed to be inhabiting the White House , Bill Clinton appeared as sage as King Solomon , minus the latter \u2019 s 700 wives and 300 concubines ( although it might depend on how you count ) , and people sought him out as a shepherd . In 2008 , however , Barack Obama made Clinton lose his cool , in more than one way , and , today , people are suggesting that Clinton has lost the magic entirely . This Wednesday , he defended his support for tough crime measures in 1994 and welfare reform in 1996 , putting on a spirited and sincere show , but one that earned him accusations of being condescending and tone-deaf and \u201c very dehumanizing. \u201d Just a couple of weeks ago , he spoke of the \u201c awful legacy of the last eight years , \u201d a complaint probably uttered with Republican opposition in mind , but one that could not have pleased the current White House . Some have now urged Hillary Clinton to bench her husband . \u201c She can \u2019 t divorce him , \u201d Michelle Goldberg wrote recently in Slate , \u201c but she can fire him . \u201d\nPicking on the Clintons is not without its rewards , campaign stumbles aside . Their habit of approaching the line of vulgarity ( or illegality ) , like a drunk trucker swaying almost ( but not quite fully ) out of his lane , can drive even their fans crazy . But while Clinton \u2019 s mind may be as disorganized as ever , it is still strong ; his unvetted remarks are excusable ; and his voice\u2014for all its foibles\u2014remains valuable . In fact , it might be insidiously valuable during this particular election cycle .\nWe \u2019 ll start with the gaffes , which have set people talking about mental decline . This narrative is a pesky one that \u2019 s hard to get rid of once it takes root , and every misstep becomes another confirmation of it . But it \u2019 s silly . While all of us are going downhill after age 25 , more so at 70 than at 50 , Clinton \u2019 s mind still seems to be in fine repair . Politicians say rash things all the time . That \u2019 s unavoidable in the profession , unless you want to go pure robot . Anyone remember \u201c I didn \u2019 t inhale \u201d ? That dumb line was voiced over two decades ago , but no one thought it meant Bill Clinton had lost his political gifts . They simply concluded that he could be full of it , a belief that subsequent years didn \u2019 t dispel . This year , however , Clinton is making far less trouble than in 2008 , when he was insisting , for instance , that Hillary and Obama hadn \u2019 t really differed on Iraq . Despite a few glancing digs at Bernie Sanders , he has been pretty peaceful . Even when protesters try to disrupt events , he \u2019 s patient .\nThe charitably minded will also acknowledge that mastering the twin roles of ex-president and spousal campaign surrogate is tough , not to mention unprecedented . Sit out the campaign , and it looks weird , generating other sorts of embarrassment and headlines . Is Bill under house arrest ? Is Bill being hidden ? Exclusive : Bill has 6 months to live ! On the other hand , any president , even a former one , looms dangerously large on a stage next to a mere aspirant . Get too involved in the mud-throwing of a primary , and you not only lose your statesmanlike aura but also look like you \u2019 re taking the wheel of the car . That happened in 2008 , when Clinton couldn \u2019 t help but act like someone desperate to be in charge again . In 2016 , though , he looks much more like a supporting player . He \u2019 s performing before Podunk venues across New York and doing his best to play to his strength : connecting with people in a non-giant room . Are you going to advise Hillary not to send her husband to talk to 850 people at the Grapevine Banquets in Depew ( just east of Cheektowaga , if you \u2019 re looking to place it ) on the grounds that it \u2019 ll hurt more than help ? Please .",
