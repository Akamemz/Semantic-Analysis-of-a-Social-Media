Ask me , ask Chuck Todd , ask anyone .\nThere \u2019 s a perfect alignment between the reputation he wants , the reputation he has , and the reputation he deserves in a way that \u2019 s unequalled among American politicians and that allows him to conduct himself with an even greater degree of shamelessness than Donald Trump himself since unlike the all-id Trump , McConnell isn \u2019 t out of control he \u2019 s just willing to be utterly ruthless in pursuit of his political objectives .\nIt would be wrong to see this as a zero-cost strategy . Most people who get into electoral politics do it , on some level , because they want to be liked and admired , and McConnell does not .
