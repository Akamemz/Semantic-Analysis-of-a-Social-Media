But he agrees with Putnam that that extracurricular activities should be free in public schools , that poor kids who do dumb things should get the benefit of the doubt like their affluent peers , and that pre-school is a good way to take poor kids out of a punishing environment even when , in his view , the outcome 20 years down the road doesn \u2019 t justify the expenditure .\n\u201c Government has a lot worse ways of spending my money , \u201d he said .\nStill , Murray said that , even if society did all the things Putnam calls for , little would change . He said that this is because the \u201c opportunity gap \u201d between rich and poor \u201c is driven by larger forces that his policy prescriptions can \u2019 t do anything about . \u201d\nMurray and Putnam have different interpretations of those larger forces , everything from globalization to the breakdown of family structure . But their agreement on some potential policies speaks to the enormity of the challenge facing the country as the current flock of presidential candidates grapple with increasing economic inequality and its social costs .\nThough Putnam and Murray come from opposite ends of the political spectrum , they see the same big trends , and they agree that the disparity is less about race than it is about class . One indicator is that inter-marriage rates are rising and \u201c we tend not to marry people we don \u2019 t know , \u201d Putnam said to a smattering of delayed laughter , explaining this is important \u201c because people of a marriageable age are more likely to encounter people of another race or religion . \u201d\nFewer encounters occur across class lines , and the thesis that Putnam lays out in his new book , Our Kids : The American Dream in Crisis , finds a growing divide between rich and poor , with rich defined not as the top 1 percent but the upper third of society where parents and children are college graduates .\n\u201c Raise your hand if you have a college degree , \u201d he told the crowd of mostly young . Almost every hand went up .\nThe money affluent parents invest in their kids for summer camp , piano lessons , and trips to France has skyrocketed to nearly $ 7,000 per kid per year , while there \u2019 s no increase in the lower two-thirds of families .

Meanwhile , activities for public school kids that 20 years ago were free , like football , band , and chorus , now carry a price tag .\nA parent with an income of $ 200,000 has no problem with this arrangement . But if you have an income of $ 16,000 , and you have two kids , two semesters can set you back $ 1,600 , Putnam said . \u201c Who in their right mind would pay 10 percent of their income for their kids to take part in athletics or band ? \u201d\nPutnam gained notice with his 2000 book , Bowling Alone , which describes the decline in civic engagement .
