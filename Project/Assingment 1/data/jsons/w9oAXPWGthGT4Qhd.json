    "content": "It \u2019 s not really in character for Hillary Clinton to speak in terms of vivid imagery , creative metaphors , or striking turns of phrase . But she did it over the weekend , setting off a growing firestorm of controversy that \u2019 s defined the week in politics .\n\u201c You know , \u201d Clinton said to a friendly crowd of wealthy donors this weekend , \u201c to just be grossly generalistic , you could put half of Trump 's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables . Right ? The racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic \u2014 you name it . \u201d\nWith that odd turn of phrase \u2014 basket of deplorables \u2014 Clinton sent the media-politico ecosystem into a tizzy . Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign immediately took offense on behalf of his constituents , and Clinton rather rapidly apologized . But Trump has only escalated . At a Monday night rally in North Carolina , he accused Clinton of running a \u201c hate-filled and negative campaign \u201d and released a television ad built around the remark .\nAnd indeed , while Clinton apologized for painting with such a broad brush as to call fully half of Trump \u2019 s supporters deplorables , her campaign is very much sticking to the core accusation that Trump is trafficking in bigotry .\nMeanwhile , some liberals think Clinton was wrong to back away from her numerical estimates . Writers like the Atlantic \u2019 s Ta-Nehisi Coates , Slate \u2019 s Jamelle Bouie , New York \u2019 s Jonathan Chait , and \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s own German Lopez have all argued that , as best as we can tell , Clinton was , if anything , undercounting the quantity of irredeemable bigots in Trump \u2019 s ranks .\nThe multifaceted controversy touches on two of the more enduring taboos in American politics \u2014 frank discussion of racism and disparaging the electorate . And it highlights the contrasting campaign strategies of the Trump and Clinton camps . It started because the Trump camp correctly sensed Clinton had made a mistake .\nBut it continues so viciously because it covers terrain Clinton is fundamentally comfortable with \u2014 reenforcing a dynamic in which Trump , like the television entertainer he is , chases the ever-tighter loyalty of a minority \u2014 while Clinton seeks to paint Trump as broadly unacceptable to the general population that will be voting in November .\nClinton \u2019 s remarks came in the context of what was essentially a fundraising pitch . She expressed her understanding of the fact that despite massive strides in achieving legal and social equality , LGBTQ Americans still face many challenges . \u201c You can get married on Saturday , post your pictures on Sunday , and get fired on Monday , \u201d she said before launching into a litany of specific policy commitments she \u2019 s made to the LGBTQ community .\nI know there are only 60 days left to make our case \u2014 and do n't get complacent , do n't see the latest outrageous , offensive , inappropriate comment and think , well , he 's done this time . We are living in a volatile political environment . You know , to just be grossly generalistic , you could put half of Trump 's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables . Right ? The racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic \u2014 you name it . And unfortunately there are people like that . And he has lifted them up . He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people \u2014 now 11 million . He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric . Now , some of those folks \u2014 they are irredeemable , but thankfully they are not America . But the other basket \u2014 and I know this because I see friends from all over America here ; I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas , as well as , you know , New York and California \u2014 but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down , the economy has let them down , nobody cares about them , nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures , and they 're just desperate for change . It does n't really even matter where it comes from . They do n't buy everything he says , but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different . They wo n't wake up and see their jobs disappear , lose a kid to heroin , feel like they 're in a dead end . Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well . And what I hope is that in addition to your extraordinary generosity , you will go to our website , HillaryClinton.com , or text to join at 47246 to see how else you can get involved .\nTo be persnickety about it , the problem here is that Clinton is somewhat herself .\nOn the one hand , she \u2019 s saying that Donald Trump \u2019 s racist and Islamophobic statements and dog whistles have activated and energized a small minority of hardcore bigots . She \u2019 s saying that Trump has taken once-obscure websites and elevated their traffic by a factor of 100 .\nOn the other hand , she \u2019 s saying that the \u201c basket of deplorables \u201d contains about half of Trump supporters \u2014 which is to say it \u2019 s about a quarter of the electorate and not really a small fringe at all .\nThe upshot of Clinton \u2019 s quasi-apology is to disavow the second claim while increasing her bet on the first . Their strategy was boosted when Donald Trump Jr. responded to the controversy by Instagramming a pro-Trump meme image featuring Pepe the Frog , a common white nationalist symbol ( that \u2019 s an explainer for another day , but Olivia Nuzzi \u2019 s primer is a good place to start ) and then Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence went on CNN and refused to call former KKK grand wizard David Duke deplorable , suggesting the current Republican Party is in a tough spot when it comes to white nationalists .\nClinton \u2019 s use of the phrase \u201c deplorables \u201d at the LGBTQ gala was not unique . Earlier in the week , in an English-language interview on Israeli television , Clinton explained , \u201c If I were to be grossly generalistic , I 'd say you can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets . There are what I call the deplorables. \u201d And then there are the rest \u2014 lots of basically good , decent Americans who she believes don \u2019 t buy into the ugly side of what Trump is saying but who are so desperate to see change in American politics that they are willing to vote for Trump .\nWriting at Slate , Ben Zimmer suggests that the \u201c basket of deplorables \u201d construction entered Clinton \u2019 s mind by way of analogy with the term \u201c parade of horribles , \u201d which , starting in the 1920s , \u201c entered legal usage as a dismissive term for imagined concerns about a ruling 's negative effects . \u201d\nClinton is an attorney by training , so Zimmer thinks she would be accustomed to that particular instance of nouning an adjective .\nActual English-language use of \u201c deplorables \u201d as a term for a group of people , however , is quite rare , though Zimmer did find Thomas Carlyle in 1831 writing that \u201c of all the deplorables and despicables of this city and time the saddest are the \u2018 literary men . \u2019 \u201d\nIn general , this type of linguistic term suggests to me the vocabulary of revolutionary France ( and , indeed , Carlyle wrote an early history of the French Revolution ) . This vocabulary is probably most familiar to the mass audience from the musical and book Les Mis\u00e9rables , with its invocation of \u201c the miserables \u201d as a term for the French urban poor . But the revolutionary era also gave us Les Enrag\u00e9s ( \u201c the enraged \u201d ) as a term for a loose group of radical polemicists , the Sans-Culottes ( \u201c the pantsless , \u201d i.e. , people who were the opposite of fancy pants ) for the Paris mob , and other instances of nouning adjectives to give a name to social classes .\nWherever Clinton got it from exactly , it seems that in her LGBTQ gala she committed the cardinal political spin of mixing up two different spiels .\nOne spiel , the one that includes the phrase \u201c deplorables , \u201d is intended to set the stage for a rhetorical pivot to the idea that the vast majority of Trump supporters aren \u2019 t deplorable . She wants to say that they are , mostly , simply confused . They are frustrated by the political status quo , as is she , and she hopes that if she wins she can deliver change and prosperity and win them over despite their doubts .\nThe other spiel is intended to recapitulate the themes of Clinton \u2019 s speech on Trump and the alt-right in which she denounces Trump individually for elevating a handful of extreme and hateful voices that early Republican leaders would have marginalized . By crossing the rhetorical streams , Clinton wound up saying that fully half of Trump supporters belong in the tiny basket of hateful extremists . Whatever one makes of that as a question of demographics , it doesn \u2019 t make sense as a piece of political rhetoric , which is why Clinton backed away from it .\nIn the overwhelmingly white community of political journalists , it felt natural to take the fact that Clinton had made a political error as the starting point of analysis and proceed from there . But a group of writers , disproportionately and not coincidentally composed of people of color , wanted to press the point that Clinton was probably correct . Her political error , if there was an error , was in breaking the taboo around saying that racial bias is a potent and widespread force in contemporary American life .\nAs Lopez wrote for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , public opinion polling strongly suggests that a great majority of Trump supporters hold unfavorable views of Muslims and support a policy that bans Muslims from entering the US . Most of them support proposals that stifle immigration from Mexico , and they agree with Trump \u2019 s comments that Mexican immigrants are criminals . And many \u2014 but not a majority \u2014 say that black people are less intelligent and more violent than their white peers .\nIn particular , a Reuters/Ipsos polling analysis of the GOP primary showed that Donald Trump \u2019 s supporters stood out from backers of the other GOP candidates primarily in having highly negative attitudes toward nonwhite groups .\nWhether the \u201c deplorables \u201d are really half of Trump \u2019 s current general election voters depends a bit on how you count , but it \u2019 s at least a plausible estimate .\nOne important nuance about this that liberals sometimes miss is that even though there \u2019 s a lot of reason to believe racial hostility was key to Trump \u2019 s rise , there \u2019 s very little reason to think that white racism in general is more widespread in 2016 than it was 20 or 30 years ago . Rather , as Lee Drutman writes separately for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the issue is that \u201c whites with strong racist attitudes turned much more sharply Republican following Obama 's election , including some who had previously been Democrats . \u201d\nBack in the 1980s and \u2019 90s , the Democratic Party was already identified as being more aligned with black interests , but the election of an actual black president combined with the growth of the nonwhite population kicked that identification into overdrive . Racially resentful whites left the Democratic Party , and Democrats decided they could build a winning coalition without them , turning racial attitudes into a powerful axis of partisan conflict .\nHow does this compare with the infamous \u201c 47 percent \u201d tape ?\nAaron Blake at the Washington Post immediately reacted to the news of Clinton \u2019 s remarks by asking \u201c Did Hillary Clinton just make her own \u2018 47 percent \u2019 gaffe ? \u201d\nThis is a reference to a secret video recording released to Mother Jones in September 2012 that showed Mitt Romney at a closed-door fundraiser explaining that there was a 47 percent floor on Barack Obama \u2019 s support :\nThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what . All right , there are 47 percent who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you-name-it . That that 's an entitlement . And the government should give it to them . And they will vote for this president no matter what . \u2026 These are people who pay no income tax .\nThese remarks rapidly entered the lexicon of political operatives and journalists as a textbook example of a damaging gaffe , so framing Clinton \u2019 s remarks as a potential new \u201c 47 percent moment \u201d is meant to play up their potential consequences .\nHowever , just as the actual Hurricane Katrina did not have the political impact that the search for \u201c Obama \u2019 s Katrina \u201d implies , there is little reason to believe the 47 percent gaffe hurt Romney . Indeed , in their excellent empirical account of the 2012 campaign The Gamble , John Sides and Lynn Vavreck find that none of the many well-covered gaffes of the 2012 season made much of a difference . On a high level , the economic fundamentals favored an Obama victory , which is what happened , and Romney proved more popular than virtually every GOP Senate nominee , which indicates that at the end of the day the party chose a fairly effective messenger .\nDespite what I wrote above , it is widely believed in professional political circles that the 47 percent gaffe hurt Romney , so it \u2019 s natural for practitioners to leap at the chance to relive it . Beyond that , despite some recent tightening in the polls , Trump is still losing .\nIndeed , he has been consistently losing from day one of this election . At times he \u2019 s made it close , but he \u2019 s never been ahead . His best chance of winning would probably be some kind of economic calamity , but it \u2019 s already mid-September , so he \u2019 s running a bit short on time . ( Remember , though , that in 2008 Obama was the beneficiary of a spectacular financial meltdown in October , so anything can happen ) . He has to try to do something , and the big push around deplorables is indeed something .\nBeyond that , the basket of deplorables idea reenforces a longstanding conservative contention that liberal coastal elites fundamentally despise white working-class Americans . They view white working-class culture as backward , white working-class politics as bigoted , and white working-class community problems as fundamentally less worthy of addressing than those of downscale black and Latino communities .\nIn that sense , the Clinton gaffe is reminiscent of Barack Obama \u2019 s characterization of \u201c small town \u201d politics from the 2008 primary as full of people who \u201c get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who are n't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting , however , that Obama and Clinton were in a sense positioning themselves on opposite ends of the liberal spectrum of views on this matter . Obama was essentially a premature proponent of the \u201c economic anxiety \u201d school of Trump Studies , promoting the view that all of conservative cultural politics is a massive case of false consciousness in which residents of failing economic communities cling bitterly to guns , religion , and racism , which in turn induces them to vote for mainstream Republicans .\nClinton , meanwhile , is offering the considerably more mainstream view that one reason many Americans are planning to vote for a man who says racist stuff is that a large share of those Americans agree with the racist stuff he says .\nClinton \u2019 s big problem is you \u2019 re not supposed to attack the voters , and she did\nWhile some critics see Clinton \u2019 s willingness to back away from her comments as a sign of cowardice or expediency , the norm against attacking the other party \u2019 s constituents has a real logic to it .\n\u201c We are all Republicans , we are all Federalists , \u201d said Thomas Jefferson in his inaugural address that marked the first peaceful transfer of power between political parties in American history . \u201c If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form , let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it . \u201d\nThis can read as simply banal two centuries later , but it \u2019 s worth considering it in context . A losing party whose members fear the other party will persecute them if they lose and go into opposition has every reason to resist giving up power peacefully . And a winning party that fears the other party will resist giving up power has every reason to persecute the losers .\nPreventing a downward spiral of violence and civil conflict requires the winners to reassure the losers that they are not losing everything by giving up power . Reassuring the losing party \u2019 s supporters that they are not the targets of personal enmity on the part of the winning party \u2019 s leaders is key to that .\nIt \u2019 s since become traditional for newly elected presidents to mouth some version of this message almost ritualistically . And like many rituals , it \u2019 s actually pretty important , even if cynics are inclined to roll their eyes at it \u2014 the quadrennial reminder that we are Americans with policy disagreements , not warring tribes , is crucial civic glue .\nWhat ties together the 47 percent , the bitter clingers , and the basket of deplorables is an apparent tradition of violating this ritual at fundraising talks \u2014 badmouthing not the opposition party but its voters in an effort to rationalize away the fact that the candidate won \u2019 t be able to secure their votes .\nIf this controversy becomes about racism , Clinton has an advantage\nThe fact that he \u2019 s been consistently losing tends to obscure this , but Trump has a lot of advantages in the 2016 race . Clinton herself is very unpopular with the American mass public , and she has a notoriously poor relationship with the American news media . People with liberal public policy views but weak institutional and emotional attachments to the Democratic Party overwhelmingly voted for her opponent in the primaries , and there is a real risk of them either not voting in November or else pulling the lever for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein .\nThe nation \u2019 s overall \u201c policy mood \u201d typically shifts in the opposite direction of the incumbent president , and the Obama years have been no exception .\nIndeed , in state after state \u2014 from New Hampshire to Nevada to Ohio to Florida and beyond \u2014 virtually every Republican Party Senate candidate is performing better than Trump .\nTrump \u2019 s strong personal affiliation with racism is not the only reason this is the case , but it is one of the reasons . In the primaries , Trump \u2019 s willingness to court racial controversy worked in his favor because most Republicans take the view that discrimination against nonwhites is an overblown problem in the United States .\nThis view commands overwhelming support among Republicans , but few prominent Republican Party officeholders have championed it because it \u2019 s not popular with the public at large . Trump \u2019 s willingness to say and do things that other presidential contenders wouldn \u2019 t say or do \u2014 that all Muslims should be banned from the United States or that Mexican immigrants are a physical threat to Americans \u2019 safety \u2014 thrilled the primary electorate but alienates general election voters .\nTrump , by loudly and proudly defending white Americans from charges of racism , intensifies his bond with his core base of racially resentful working-class whites . That \u2019 s an excellent strategy for pumping up rally crowds or building a hypothetical future media business , but does nothing to help him reach the people \u2014 minorities and racially liberal whites \u2014 who find him disturbing .\nBack during the heyday of Richard Nixon \u2019 s Southern strategy , Pat Buchanan , then an adviser to the White House , wrote that by playing cultural wedge politics \u201c we can break the country in half and it will leave us with far the larger half . \u201d\nTrump , who is backed by Buchanan and advised by the old Nixon hand Roger Ailes , is employing the exact same strategy today \u2014 except 40 years of demographic changes mean he \u2019 s left with the smaller half .",

Racially resentful whites left the Democratic Party, and Democrats decided they could build a winning coalition without them, turning racial attitudes into a powerful axis of partisan conflict.\n\nHow does this compare with the infamous \u201c47 percent\u201d tape?\n\nAaron Blake at the Washington Post immediately reacted to the news of Clinton\u2019s remarks by asking \u201cDid Hillary Clinton just make her own \u201847 percent\u2019 gaffe?\u201d\n\nThis is a reference to a secret video recording released to Mother Jones in September 2012 that showed Mitt Romney at a closed-door fundraiser explaining that there was a 47 percent floor on Barack Obama\u2019s support:\n\nThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. \u2026 These are people who pay no income tax.\n\nThese remarks rapidly entered the lexicon of political operatives and journalists as a textbook example of a damaging gaffe, so framing Clinton\u2019s remarks as a potential new \u201c47 percent moment\u201d is meant to play up their potential consequences.\n\nHowever, just as the actual Hurricane Katrina did not have the political impact that the search for \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d implies, there is little reason to believe the 47 percent gaffe hurt Romney. Indeed, in their excellent empirical account of the 2012 campaign The Gamble, John Sides and Lynn Vavreck find that none of the many well-covered gaffes of the 2012 season made much of a difference. On a high level, the economic fundamentals favored an Obama victory, which is what happened, and Romney proved more popular than virtually every GOP Senate nominee, which indicates that at the end of the day the party chose a fairly effective messenger.\n\nWhy is Trump up in arms about this?\n\nDespite what I wrote above, it is widely believed in professional political circles that the 47 percent gaffe hurt Romney, so it\u2019s natural for practitioners to leap at the chance to relive it. Beyond that, despite some recent tightening in the polls, Trump is still losing.\n\nIndeed, he has been consistently losing from day one of this election. At times he\u2019s made it close, but he\u2019s never been ahead. His best chance of winning would probably be some kind of economic calamity, but it\u2019s already mid-September, so he\u2019s running a bit short on time. (Remember, though, that in 2008 Obama was the beneficiary of a spectacular financial meltdown in October, so anything can happen). He has to try to do something, and the big push around deplorables is indeed something.\n\nBeyond that, the basket of deplorables idea reenforces a longstanding conservative contention that liberal coastal elites fundamentally despise white working-class Americans. They view white working-class culture as backward, white working-class politics as bigoted, and white working-class community problems as fundamentally less worthy of addressing than those of downscale black and Latino communities.\n\nIn that sense, the Clinton gaffe is reminiscent of Barack Obama\u2019s characterization of \u201csmall town\u201d politics from the 2008 primary as full of people who \u201cget bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that Obama and Clinton were in a sense positioning themselves on opposite ends of the liberal spectrum of views on this matter. Obama was essentially a premature proponent of the \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d school of Trump Studies, promoting the view that all of conservative cultural politics is a massive case of false consciousness in which residents of failing economic communities cling bitterly to guns, religion, and racism, which in turn induces them to vote for mainstream Republicans.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, is offering the considerably more mainstream view that one reason many Americans are planning to vote for a man who says racist stuff is that a large share of those Americans agree with the racist stuff he says.\n\nClinton\u2019s big problem is you\u2019re not supposed to attack the voters, and she did\n\nWhile some critics see Clinton\u2019s willingness to back away from her comments as a sign of cowardice or expediency, the norm against attacking the other party\u2019s constituents has a real logic to it.\n\n\u201cWe are all Republicans, we are all Federalists,\u201d said Thomas Jefferson in his inaugural address that marked the first peaceful transfer of power between political parties in American history. \u201cIf there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\u201d\n\nThis can read as simply banal two centuries later, but it\u2019s worth considering it in context. A losing party whose members fear the other party will persecute them if they lose and go into opposition has every reason to resist giving up power peacefully. And a winning party that fears the other party will resist giving up power has every reason to persecute the losers.\n\nPreventing a downward spiral of violence and civil conflict requires the winners to reassure the losers that they are not losing everything by giving up power. Reassuring the losing party\u2019s supporters that they are not the targets of personal enmity on the part of the winning party\u2019s leaders is key to that.\n\nIt\u2019s since become traditional for newly elected presidents to mouth some version of this message almost ritualistically. And like many rituals, it\u2019s actually pretty important, even if cynics are inclined to roll their eyes at it \u2014 the quadrennial reminder that we are Americans with policy disagreements, not warring tribes, is crucial civic glue.\n\nWhat ties together the 47 percent, the bitter clingers, and the basket of deplorables is an apparent tradition of violating this ritual at fundraising talks \u2014 badmouthing not the opposition party but its voters in an effort to rationalize away the fact that the candidate won\u2019t be able to secure their votes.\n\nIf this controversy becomes about racism, Clinton has an advantage\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s been consistently losing tends to obscure this, but Trump has a lot of advantages in the 2016 race. Clinton herself is very unpopular with the American mass public, and she has a notoriously poor relationship with the American news media. People with liberal public policy views but weak institutional and emotional attachments to the Democratic Party overwhelmingly voted for her opponent in the primaries, and there is a real risk of them either not voting in November or else pulling the lever for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein.\n\nThe nation\u2019s overall \u201cpolicy mood\u201d typically shifts in the opposite direction of the incumbent president, and the Obama years have been no exception.\n\nIndeed, in state after state \u2014 from New Hampshire to Nevada to Ohio to Florida and beyond \u2014 virtually every Republican Party Senate candidate is performing better than Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s strong personal affiliation with racism is not the only reason this is the case, but it is one of the reasons. In the primaries, Trump\u2019s willingness to court racial controversy worked in his favor because most Republicans take the view that discrimination against nonwhites is an overblown problem in the United States.\n\nThis view commands overwhelming support among Republicans, but few prominent Republican Party officeholders have championed it because it\u2019s not popular with the public at large. Trump\u2019s willingness to say and do things that other presidential contenders wouldn\u2019t say or do \u2014 that all Muslims should be banned from the United States or that Mexican immigrants are a physical threat to Americans\u2019 safety \u2014 thrilled the primary electorate but alienates general election voters.\n\nTrump, by loudly and proudly defending white Americans from charges of racism, intensifies his bond with his core base of racially resentful working-class whites. That\u2019s an excellent strategy for pumping up rally crowds or building a hypothetical future media business, but does nothing to help him reach the people \u2014 minorities and racially liberal whites \u2014 who find him disturbing.\n\nBack during the heyday of Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy, Pat Buchanan, then an adviser to the White House, wrote that by playing cultural wedge politics \u201cwe can break the country in half and it will leave us with far the larger half.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is backed by Buchanan and advised by the old Nixon hand Roger Ailes, is employing the exact same strategy today \u2014 except 40 years of demographic changes mean he\u2019s left with the smaller half.",
