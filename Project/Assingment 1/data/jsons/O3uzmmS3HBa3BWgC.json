    "content": "I traveled throughout the world with my friend and Senate colleague John McCain , visiting allies , trouble spots , and American soldiers . I \u2019 ll never forget one such trip : John and I were both reading when our jet encountered a terrible storm .\nThe aircraft was bouncing up and down as angry bolts of lightning split the night skies . But when I looked over at John , the former Navy pilot was engrossed in his book .\n\u201c Hey John , \u201d I said , a bit incredulous . \u201c Are you aware of what \u2019 s going on around this plane ? \u201d\nHe leaned over to me and said , \u201c Joey , if I was meant to die on an airplane , it would have happened over Vietnam . \u201d\nFor a quarter of a century , I served with John in the Senate , working for bipartisan legislation to improve our country at home , and to make America a powerful force for freedom throughout the world .\nGetting to know John McCain was one of the greatest blessings of my time in the Senate . He was a great person , a superior public servant , and a trusted friend and colleague .\nJohn hailed from one of the most storied military families in American history . Both his father and his grandfather were four-star admirals in the United States Navy .\nAfter graduating from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis , John became a Navy A-4 Skyhawk ground attack pilot . He was deployed to Vietnam to serve on the USS Forrestal aircraft carrier .\nIn July 1967 , an electrical malfunction on the carrier \u2019 s deck led to the accidental discharge of a rocket from an aircraft . When the rocket detonated , it set John \u2019 s jet afire \u2014 with him in it .\nAs recounted in his book \u201c Faith of My Fathers : A Family Memoir , \u201d Lt. Cmdr . McCain had just escaped his burning aircraft when a bomb detonated , hitting him with shrapnel .\nThe ship \u2019 s crew won a valiant battle to save their vessel , but at a terrible price : A staggering 134 sailors died , with another 161 wounded .\nThe battered Forrestal went off to a dry dock for repairs , but John wanted to get back in the fight . So he sought an assignment to another aircraft carrier , the USS Oriskany , and resumed flying missions over North Vietnam .\nBy October 1967 , he \u2019 d already executed more than 20 bombing missions when his jet was hit by a missile over Hanoi . He was forced to eject from the aircraft , breaking both arms and his right knee in the process .\nReports say he parachuted into a lake and nearly drowned before being dragged to shore by a mob of angry Vietnamese .\nThere , the Vietnamese greeted the airman by pulverizing his shoulder joint with the butt of a rifle .\nThey stabbed him with a bayonet before hauling him off to the infamous house of torture known as the Hanoi Hilton .\nBeatings and withholding desperately needed medical treatment were routine in that detestable hellhole .\nHis father , Adm. John S. McCain , became commander of all U.S. forces in Vietnam from 1968 to 1972 . When John \u2019 s captors in Hanoi learned of his pedigree , they offered their prisoner an early release . But John was keenly aware that any preferential treatment he received would hand the Vietnamese a propaganda coup , and would devastate the morale of the POWs he would leave behind .\nHe agreed to accept an early release , but with one condition : Every prisoner captured ahead of him must also be given his freedom . The Vietnamese refused .\nThat was an act of honor and courage . It is hard to imagine most anyone else but John having the strength to do the same thing .\nHe would remain a prisoner of war until March 1973 . By then , the damage inflicted on his body was so severe that for the rest of his life he would be unable to raise his arms over his head . When much later in his career he became an outspoken opponent of waterboarding , nobody had to ask why .\nUpon returning stateside , John underwent a lengthy rehabilitation , then commanded a training squadron in Florida . He also served for a time as the Navy \u2019 s liaison to the U.S. Senate .\nIt was there that his lifetime desire to serve our country took a turn toward government . After he and Cindy married , they moved to Arizona where John was elected first to the House , and then to the Senate in 1986 .\nWhen I joined the Senate in 1989 , two years after he did , I was aware of John \u2019 s heroic life and I had great respect for him .\nOne day I approached him on the Senate floor and said , \u201c You know , we ought to work together on some things. \u201d And he said , \u201c I \u2019 d like that. \u201d It was as simple as that .\nOne example of our bipartisanship : I supported then-President George H.W . Bush \u2019 s request to direct the American military to boot Saddam Hussein \u2019 s troops out of Kuwait in 1991 .\nJohn and I both believed we could not let Saddam \u2019 s aggression stand , thereby inviting him to move against Saudi Arabia and jeopardize our oil supply and economy . We had to take action to push him back . That \u2019 s how our working friendship began .\nThen , when the war in Bosnia broke out in the \u2019 90s , John and I both feared it was a decisive moment : Would the end of the Soviet Union usher in an era when the bullies and aggressors would take over large parts of Europe again ? Would we sit back and watch genocide occur in Europe ?\nJohn and I worked together and ultimately we helped get President Bill Clinton and European leaders to commit to halt the violence . That genocidal episode ended better than anyone could have hoped with the signing of the Dayton peace accords .\nBy this point , John and I had become good friends . We would travel overseas together to meet with foreign leaders and U.S. troops , and attended an annual security conference each February in Munich .\nIn fact , at John \u2019 s behest I continued to attend that conference even after I retired from the Senate in 2013 .\nThat year when he called to urge me to go , he said , \u201c You \u2019 re going to be the elder statesman on this delegation . \u201d\nThen when we got there , we were in a meeting with a world leader and he introduced me this way : \u201c Remember Sen. Lieberman ? We \u2019 re really very grateful that the folks at his nursing home let him out for the weekend. \u201d Even I laughed .\nDespite the physical challenges John endured after Vietnam , he was an indefatigable force of nature . Staffers in their 30s said he ran them into the ground .\nDuring our jaunts , it seemed he would always add another stop to our itinerary .\nOn our way to Munich we would go to Belgrade , Moscow , or Madrid . You \u2019 d just put your suit on , leave the plane , meet with the heads of state , see a little bit of the country , then get back on the plane and fly on to Munich .\nDuring our travels , John became aware that I am religiously observant , and observe the Jewish Sabbath . It was unusual to him , but he understood when we were traveling it was important to get me there before sundown Friday .\nHe almost always did that \u2014 although he said he \u2019 d get me a rabbinical waiver if we went a little over sundown .\nTraditionally , the American delegation to the Munich security conference would attend a party on the city \u2019 s outskirts on Friday night . But on the Sabbath , I don \u2019 t ride except in an emergency .\nTypical of John , he said on Friday night : \u2018 I \u2019 m not going to go to the party . \u201d\nAfter that , on Fridays we \u2019 d have dinner at the hotel or walk to our favorite restaurant in Munich .\nThe size of our Sabbath dinner group gradually grew , as a lot of other members of Congress joined us . The Friday night dinner , by the way , was the only occasion when I saw John have a drink , a strong \u201c Schnapps \u201d liqueur .\nHis respect for my religious observance was just part of our friendship . Somebody joked to me once that traveling with John McCain was like being part of one of history \u2019 s great military death marches . The only question was which of us was going to make it to the end .\nThanks to John , we saw more , learned more , and had more experiences than we ever thought possible .\nThe John McCain I knew was a patriot \u2014 he was born into it because of his father and grandfather . He was born to serve our country . When he would speak to students , he \u2019 d tell them what a great sense of satisfaction they would derive from serving a cause larger than themselves . For John , that cause was America . But his was not a mindless loyalty . It was a patriotism based on America \u2019 s values , and America \u2019 s purpose in the world . It was all about freedom and human rights .\nThe terror attacks that on 9/11 brought down the twin towers , part of the Pentagon , and a jet airliner in Pennsylvania , were a tremendous shock to all Americans \u2014 but especially to those of us who had spent our careers trying to do whatever we could to keep America strong and safe .\nWe were angry that our country hadn \u2019 t seen what was coming . Because when you look back , there was a terrorist attempt on the World Trade Center \u2019 s north tower using a truck bomb in 1993 , attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000 .\nA lot of the government agencies involved in intelligence , surveillance , and law enforcement saw all this , but they weren \u2019 t collaborating . John and I felt a real responsibility to fix what was broken and , to the best of our ability , to prevent any attack like that from ever happening again .\nAbout five weeks after 9/11 , we were in the green room one Sunday for a joint appearance on Meet the Press . We talked with each other about the fact that we needed to know how 9/11 happened before we could try to make sure it never happened again . There was a rising but dissonant chorus calling for an investigation into what had happened . Different congressional committees were vying for the lead in it , there was some talk that the administration itself would appoint a commission .\nOn the show , we joined together to call for a totally independent , nonpartisan commission to investigate what led to the attack .\nWe also introduced a bill . It wasn \u2019 t easy because the administration was defensive about what had happened , and didn \u2019 t want an independent investigation .\nSome members of Congress didn \u2019 t want it either , because they wanted to do it themselves . Fortunately , the families of those killed on 9/11 became a powerful and effective lobbying force in support of an independent commission . John and I met with the families several times .\nThe Commission was established and issued an excellent report . Then John and I , and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine , worked hard together with others in both parties to implement those recommendations . The Commission \u2019 s work led to the largest reorganization of our national security and intelligence architecture since the beginning of the Cold War in the late \u2019 40s .\nAs I \u2019 ve said , our objective was to ensure what happened on 9/11 would never happen again . And I believe we did .\nIn reaction to 9/11 , the United States led invasions of Afghanistan and then Iraq . Initially , the war in Iraq went well . But due to a series of errors , conditions began to rapidly deteriorate .\nBefore long , there was a lot of talk on Capitol Hill that it was time for America to cut its losses and get out . John believed this would be disastrous for our country , and I agreed with him .\nWhile it certainly wasn \u2019 t going well in Iraq , the United States could not retreat in defeat and expect that we would have the strength and credibility needed to protect our security and freedom in the years ahead . But that view was very controversial in the Democratic Party . My position on Iraq carried a political cost . I was denied the Democratic re-nomination in Connecticut in 2006 , so I ran as an independent . And thank God and the people of Connecticut , I was re-elected .\nIn early 2007 , John , Sen. Lindsey Graham , and I returned from a fact-finding mission in Iraq in time to support the influential report presented by Gen. Jack Keane , which played a key role in Gen. David Petraeus \u2019 s deployment of the surge strategy that added 21,000 U.S. troops to push back the insurgency .\nDespite the naysayers who considered it a lost cause , it worked . After the surge , U.S. casualties in Iraq dropped from 961 in 2007 to 60 for the entire year of 2010 . And once its civilian populace was protected , the country finally began to achieve a degree of stability .\nWhat would have happened had America left Iraq to the blood-thirsty insurgents who later reconstituted themselves in Syria under the banner of ISIS ? John and I believed that would have been an unmitigated disaster for American credibility around the globe , and for American freedom and prosperity at home .\nWhen the 2008 presidential campaign began , among a lot of Democrats I still had the \u201c mark of Iraq \u201d on my forehead . Perhaps that is why neither then-Sen. Barack Obama nor former Sen. Hillary Clinton , both of whom I knew pretty well , asked me for my support .\nAs the campaign kicked off I watched John struggle . Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee won handily in Iowa , but from there the campaign moved on to New Hampshire , where I knew John \u2019 s \u201c Straight Talk Express \u201d would receive a warmer welcome .\nOne day I received a call from John , who said , \u201c I \u2019 m going to ask you a question , and I just want to say , I know I \u2019 m asking a lot of you . And if you say no , that \u2019 s the end of it , and it won \u2019 t affect our friendship at all . \u201d\nHe said , \u201c You know , it looked like I was out of it earlier in the campaign . I \u2019 m doing better now . But the big event for me is going to be the New Hampshire primary . \u201d\nHe pointed out that in the GOP primary in New Hampshire , independents can vote .\n\u201c You \u2019 re mister independent , \u201d he said . \u201c Also , your support will show I work across party lines . So I want to know if you \u2019 d endorse me in New Hampshire . \u201d\nI asked him to give me a day or two to think about it .\nAfter giving it due consideration , I decided , Why not ? After all , I \u2019 d been re-elected as an independent , and my campaign had received a lot of Republican support . I knew John was totally prepared to be a great president . He had tremendous experience and had proven himself a leader over and over again . He \u2019 d asked me for the endorsement , and he was my friend . So I called him back and I said , \u201c I \u2019 m ready to go . \u201d\nHe won the New Hampshire primary . Afterward , his campaign often asked me to come out and campaign with him , which I did with pleasure . After winning in New Hampshire , John avenged his bitter defeat in South Carolina in 2000 by winning that primary as well .\nHis competition in Florida included Huckabee , former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney , and \u201c America \u2019 s Mayor \u201d Rudy Giuliani . But John barnstormed the Sunshine State with his customary relentless energy , received some key endorsements , and ended up capturing all 57 of Florida \u2019 s delegates .\nIt was a stunning victory that gave him the nomination . In fact the next day , Mayor Giuliani dropped out of the race .\nJohn derived great satisfaction from that victory , and all the more because the pundits had basically declared him out of the race back in 2007 . But he never gave up .\nSuccess breeds success , and being on the Straight Talk Express bus was like being part of a touring band when everyone was having a great time together , including the media .\nJohn knew it was going to be tough to win in November . After two terms of President Bush , with the president of his party leaving office and not very popular , he knew people wanted a change .\nAs the year wore on , Sen. Obama was looking stronger and stronger . But John just kept working his heart out .\nThe press was constantly on the bus with him . He ran an open campaign , and sometimes he \u2019 d get in trouble because he \u2019 d be talking with the media off the cuff all the time . It was contrary to the way campaigns are normally managed , but that too was vintage John McCain .\nThat June or July , John \u2019 s campaign manager , Rick Davis , called me and said , \u201c John wants to vet you for vice president. \u201d I said , \u201c Is he serious ? \u201d He said \u201c Yes , he \u2019 s serious . \u201d\nThe point , according to Rick , was that the two of us would be a bipartisan ticket at a time when the country was in economic trouble and divided by partisanship .\nTwo or three days later John and I were out on the campaign trail together and I said : \u201c John , Rick called me about you putting me on the list to be vetted for vice president . I don \u2019 t know how you can do it , \u201d I said . \u201c I \u2019 m still a registered Democrat even though I got re-elected as an independent . \u201d\nHe said , \u201c No , I \u2019 m serious about it and I \u2019 m asking you as my friend to let us vet you . \u201d\nI said OK and went through the whole vetting process . John clung to the idea for a long time , until his campaign team convinced him that selecting me would divide the Republican Party .\nI understood completely and believe that the most important lesson from this episode was that John even thought about asking me to be on the ticket . It showed again what an independent maverick he was .\nWhen the economy seized up in September in the meltdown that would lead to the Great Recession , what was already an uphill battle became impossible . John knew it , but finished with his customary energy , honor , and grace .\nWe all have many sides to us . I had the privilege to observe John McCain under many different circumstances .\nYes , he \u2019 s the American hero , the tough guy , the fighter . But he could also be extremely contemplative and compassionate . When his Democratic colleague from Arizona , Rep. Mo Udall , languished in a nursing home , John made it a point to visit him regularly .\nOne thing a lot of people did not know about John : He was a great reader . He read history , he read fiction .\nOne of his favorites was Hemingway . He read some of the Hemingway novels a lot more than once .\nIt was this contemplative McCain who called me last year from Hidden Valley , his home in Arizona near Sedona . He was in between treatments for cancer .\nHe said , \u201c Joey , I \u2019 m out here on the terrace and I \u2019 m watching the sunrise , and I \u2019 ve already seen one hummingbird come up to the feeder. \u201d He kept track of how many different kinds of birds they \u2019 d seen out there .\nHe was realistic about his health . We talked on the phone shortly after the diagnosis . He said , \u201c You know , this is serious . \u201d\nHe told me what the odds were , adding , \u201c But I \u2019 ve got great medical care , and I \u2019 m going to fight it . \u201d\nI told him : \u201c John , those are averages they \u2019 re giving you . You \u2019 re not average . Everybody knows you \u2019 re not a normal person . \u201d\nAfter we finished laughing , he went right back to being philosophical .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been so , so lucky with the life that I \u2019 ve had a chance to lead , \u201d he said , adding , \u201c I \u2019 m going to do everything I can to make the most of every day \u201d \u2014 which he did his entire life .\nWhen John returned to Washington after his first surgery this summer , rejecting his doctors \u2019 advice so he could cast important votes on healthcare reform , his Senate colleagues gave him a long , emotional welcome . John made the most of the uplifting moment .\nWith his characteristic humor and unending grace , John quipped , \u201c I \u2019 ve had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you may have confused me with someone else . \u201d\nHe then gave one of the great speeches in recent Senate history , decrying the partisanship that has made the Congress so ineffective and disrespected . He also called for a return to bipartisan legislating , the \u201c regular order \u201d of the Senate .\nToward the end John confronted his mortality in a way he probably hadn \u2019 t since he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam . He did so with characteristic courage , realism , and optimism , and made the most of every day .\nWhenever I spoke with him , his voice would brim with warmth and thankfulness . \u201c Joey , \u201d he \u2019 d say , \u201c you and I have been to places that people with all the money in the world have not been to , and could not go to . We \u2019 ve learned a lot and we had a great time . And hopefully we did some good , too . \u201d\nI know that a lot of Republicans didn \u2019 t like how John voted on the two attempts to repeal Obamacare . But his votes were consistent with the robust values that he articulated in his extraordinary speech to the Senate .\nIn that speech , John also turned his focus to America \u2019 s important role in the world\n\u201c America , \u201d he said , \u201c has made a greater contribution than any other nation to an international order that has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history . We have been the greatest example , the greatest supporter , and the greatest defender of that order . \u201d\nHe brought it home with the indomitable American spirit : \u201c We aren \u2019 t afraid , \u201d he said . \u201c We don \u2019 t covet other people \u2019 s land and wealth . We don \u2019 t hide behind walls . We breach them . We are a blessing to humanity . What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong , aspiring , inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the dignity of all human beings , and their right to freedom and equal justice ? \u201d\nThose ideals were not just rhetoric for John . He lived them throughout his public service . I know because when we traveled we always met with freedom fighters and dissidents . And we regularly introduced resolutions condemning tyranny and supporting those fighting it on just about every continent .\nI will never forget being with John in Myanmar and meeting three young political dissidents who had just been released from a government prison .\nThey all bore the scars of incarceration , but said that one of the reasons they survived was that they learned that Sen. John McCain had spoken on their behalf on the floor of the U.S. Senate .\nThose champions of liberty will never forget the inspiring words and deeds that characterized the remarkable American life of John McCain .\nThis is modified version of a story first published as the December 2017 cover story of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine . Sen. Joe Lieberman was the first Jewish candidate to run on a major political party \u2019 s national ticket . Today he serves as a member of the board of trustees for The McCain Institute for International Leadership and several other organizations , and is a senior partner with the law firm of Kasowitz , Benson , Torres LLP .",

I\u2019ll never forget one such trip: John and I were both reading when our jet encountered a terrible storm.\n\nThe aircraft was bouncing up and down as angry bolts of lightning split the night skies.

Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, doesn\u2019t it concern you?\u201d\n\nHe leaned over to me and said, \u201cJoey, if I was meant to die on an airplane, it would have happened over Vietnam.\u201d\n\nThat was John McCain: fearless, focused, and confident.\n\nFor a quarter of a century, I served with John in the Senate, working for bipartisan legislation to improve our country at home, and to make America a powerful force for freedom throughout the world.\n\nGetting to know John McCain was one of the greatest blessings of my time in the Senate.

But on the Sabbath, I don\u2019t ride except in an emergency.\n\nTypical of John, he said on Friday night: \u2018I\u2019m not going to go to the party.\u201d\n\nAfter that, on Fridays we\u2019d have dinner at the hotel or walk to our favorite restaurant in Munich.\n\nThe size of our Sabbath dinner group gradually grew, as a lot of other members of Congress joined us. The Friday night dinner, by the way, was the only occasion when I saw John have a drink, a strong \u201cSchnapps\u201d liqueur.\n\nHis respect for my religious observance was just part of our friendship. Somebody joked to me once that traveling with John McCain was like being part of one of history\u2019s great military death marches. The only question was which of us was going to make it to the end.\n\nThanks to John, we saw more, learned more, and had more experiences than we ever thought possible.\n\nTRIED AND TRUE PATRIOT\n\nThe John McCain I knew was a patriot \u2014 he was born into it because of his father and grandfather. He was born to serve our country. When he would speak to students, he\u2019d tell them what a great sense of satisfaction they would derive from serving a cause larger than themselves. For John, that cause was America. But his was not a mindless loyalty. It was a patriotism based on America\u2019s values, and America\u2019s purpose in the world. It was all about freedom and human rights.\n\nThe terror attacks that on 9/11 brought down the twin towers, part of the Pentagon, and a jet airliner in Pennsylvania, were a tremendous shock to all Americans \u2014 but especially to those of us who had spent our careers trying to do whatever we could to keep America strong and safe.\n\nWe were angry that our country hadn\u2019t seen what was coming. Because when you look back, there was a terrorist attempt on the World Trade Center\u2019s north tower using a truck bomb in 1993, attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.\n\nA lot of the government agencies involved in intelligence, surveillance, and law enforcement saw all this, but they weren\u2019t collaborating. John and I felt a real responsibility to fix what was broken and, to the best of our ability, to prevent any attack like that from ever happening again.\n\nAbout five weeks after 9/11, we were in the green room one Sunday for a joint appearance on Meet the Press. We talked with each other about the fact that we needed to know how 9/11 happened before we could try to make sure it never happened again. There was a rising but dissonant chorus calling for an investigation into what had happened. Different congressional committees were vying for the lead in it, there was some talk that the administration itself would appoint a commission.\n\nOn the show, we joined together to call for a totally independent, nonpartisan commission to investigate what led to the attack.\n\nWe also introduced a bill. It wasn\u2019t easy because the administration was defensive about what had happened, and didn\u2019t want an independent investigation.\n\nSome members of Congress didn\u2019t want it either, because they wanted to do it themselves. Fortunately, the families of those killed on 9/11 became a powerful and effective lobbying force in support of an independent commission. John and I met with the families several times.\n\nThe Commission was established and issued an excellent report. Then John and I, and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, worked hard together with others in both parties to implement those recommendations. The Commission\u2019s work led to the largest reorganization of our national security and intelligence architecture since the beginning of the Cold War in the late \u201940s.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, our objective was to ensure what happened on 9/11 would never happen again. And I believe we did.\n\nTHE SURGE\n\nIn reaction to 9/11, the United States led invasions of Afghanistan and then Iraq. Initially, the war in Iraq went well. But due to a series of errors, conditions began to rapidly deteriorate.\n\nBefore long, there was a lot of talk on Capitol Hill that it was time for America to cut its losses and get out. John believed this would be disastrous for our country, and I agreed with him.\n\nWhile it certainly wasn\u2019t going well in Iraq, the United States could not retreat in defeat and expect that we would have the strength and credibility needed to protect our security and freedom in the years ahead. But that view was very controversial in the Democratic Party. My position on Iraq carried a political cost. I was denied the Democratic re-nomination in Connecticut in 2006, so I ran as an independent. And thank God and the people of Connecticut, I was re-elected.\n\nIn early 2007, John, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and I returned from a fact-finding mission in Iraq in time to support the influential report presented by Gen. Jack Keane, which played a key role in Gen. David Petraeus\u2019s deployment of the surge strategy that added 21,000 U.S. troops to push back the insurgency.\n\nDespite the naysayers who considered it a lost cause, it worked. After the surge, U.S. casualties in Iraq dropped from 961 in 2007 to 60 for the entire year of 2010. And once its civilian populace was protected, the country finally began to achieve a degree of stability.\n\nWhat would have happened had America left Iraq to the blood-thirsty insurgents who later reconstituted themselves in Syria under the banner of ISIS? John and I believed that would have been an unmitigated disaster for American credibility around the globe, and for American freedom and prosperity at home.\n\nWhen the 2008 presidential campaign began, among a lot of Democrats I still had the \u201cmark of Iraq\u201d on my forehead. Perhaps that is why neither then-Sen. Barack Obama nor former Sen. Hillary Clinton, both of whom I knew pretty well, asked me for my support.\n\nAs the campaign kicked off I watched John struggle. Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee won handily in Iowa, but from there the campaign moved on to New Hampshire, where I knew John\u2019s \u201cStraight Talk Express\u201d would receive a warmer welcome.\n\nOne day I received a call from John, who said, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a question, and I just want to say, I know I\u2019m asking a lot of you. And if you say no, that\u2019s the end of it, and it won\u2019t affect our friendship at all.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cGo ahead, what is it?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cYou know, it looked like I was out of it earlier in the campaign. I\u2019m doing better now. But the big event for me is going to be the New Hampshire primary.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that in the GOP primary in New Hampshire, independents can vote.\n\nA QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mister independent,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, your support will show I work across party lines. So I want to know if you\u2019d endorse me in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nI asked him to give me a day or two to think about it.\n\nAfter giving it due consideration, I decided, Why not? After all, I\u2019d been re-elected as an independent, and my campaign had received a lot of Republican support. I knew John was totally prepared to be a great president. He had tremendous experience and had proven himself a leader over and over again. He\u2019d asked me for the endorsement, and he was my friend. So I called him back and I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nHe won the New Hampshire primary. Afterward, his campaign often asked me to come out and campaign with him, which I did with pleasure. After winning in New Hampshire, John avenged his bitter defeat in South Carolina in 2000 by winning that primary as well.\n\nHis competition in Florida included Huckabee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d Rudy Giuliani. But John barnstormed the Sunshine State with his customary relentless energy, received some key endorsements, and ended up capturing all 57 of Florida\u2019s delegates.\n\nIt was a stunning victory that gave him the nomination. In fact the next day, Mayor Giuliani dropped out of the race.\n\nJohn derived great satisfaction from that victory, and all the more because the pundits had basically declared him out of the race back in 2007. But he never gave up.\n\nSuccess breeds success, and being on the Straight Talk Express bus was like being part of a touring band when everyone was having a great time together, including the media.\n\nOBAMA DERAILS THE EXPRESS\n\nJohn knew it was going to be tough to win in November. After two terms of President Bush, with the president of his party leaving office and not very popular, he knew people wanted a change.\n\nAs the year wore on, Sen. Obama was looking stronger and stronger. But John just kept working his heart out.\n\nThe press was constantly on the bus with him. He ran an open campaign, and sometimes he\u2019d get in trouble because he\u2019d be talking with the media off the cuff all the time. It was contrary to the way campaigns are normally managed, but that too was vintage John McCain.\n\nThat June or July, John\u2019s campaign manager, Rick Davis, called me and said, \u201cJohn wants to vet you for vice president.\u201d I said, \u201cIs he serious?\u201d He said \u201cYes, he\u2019s serious.\u201d\n\nThe point, according to Rick, was that the two of us would be a bipartisan ticket at a time when the country was in economic trouble and divided by partisanship.\n\nTwo or three days later John and I were out on the campaign trail together and I said: \u201cJohn, Rick called me about you putting me on the list to be vetted for vice president. I don\u2019t know how you can do it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m still a registered Democrat even though I got re-elected as an independent.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious about it and I\u2019m asking you as my friend to let us vet you.\u201d\n\nI said OK and went through the whole vetting process. John clung to the idea for a long time, until his campaign team convinced him that selecting me would divide the Republican Party.\n\nI understood completely and believe that the most important lesson from this episode was that John even thought about asking me to be on the ticket. It showed again what an independent maverick he was.\n\nWhen the economy seized up in September in the meltdown that would lead to the Great Recession, what was already an uphill battle became impossible. John knew it, but finished with his customary energy, honor, and grace.\n\nNEW BATTLE LINES\n\nWe all have many sides to us. I had the privilege to observe John McCain under many different circumstances.\n\nYes, he\u2019s the American hero, the tough guy, the fighter. But he could also be extremely contemplative and compassionate. When his Democratic colleague from Arizona, Rep. Mo Udall, languished in a nursing home, John made it a point to visit him regularly.\n\nOne thing a lot of people did not know about John: He was a great reader. He read history, he read fiction.\n\nOne of his favorites was Hemingway. He read some of the Hemingway novels a lot more than once.\n\nIt was this contemplative McCain who called me last year from Hidden Valley, his home in Arizona near Sedona. He was in between treatments for cancer.\n\nHe said, \u201cJoey, I\u2019m out here on the terrace and I\u2019m watching the sunrise, and I\u2019ve already seen one hummingbird come up to the feeder.\u201d He kept track of how many different kinds of birds they\u2019d seen out there.\n\nHe was realistic about his health. We talked on the phone shortly after the diagnosis. He said, \u201cYou know, this is serious.\u201d\n\nHe told me what the odds were, adding, \u201cBut I\u2019ve got great medical care, and I\u2019m going to fight it.\u201d\n\nI told him: \u201cJohn, those are averages they\u2019re giving you. You\u2019re not average. Everybody knows you\u2019re not a normal person.\u201d\n\nAfter we finished laughing, he went right back to being philosophical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so, so lucky with the life that I\u2019ve had a chance to lead,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to make the most of every day\u201d \u2014 which he did his entire life.\n\nWhen John returned to Washington after his first surgery this summer, rejecting his doctors\u2019 advice so he could cast important votes on healthcare reform, his Senate colleagues gave him a long, emotional welcome. John made the most of the uplifting moment.\n\nWith his characteristic humor and unending grace, John quipped, \u201cI\u2019ve had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you may have confused me with someone else.\u201d\n\nHe then gave one of the great speeches in recent Senate history, decrying the partisanship that has made the Congress so ineffective and disrespected. He also called for a return to bipartisan legislating, the \u201cregular order\u201d of the Senate.\n\nToward the end John confronted his mortality in a way he probably hadn\u2019t since he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He did so with characteristic courage, realism, and optimism, and made the most of every day.\n\nWhenever I spoke with him, his voice would brim with warmth and thankfulness. \u201cJoey,\u201d he\u2019d say, \u201cyou and I have been to places that people with all the money in the world have not been to, and could not go to. We\u2019ve learned a lot and we had a great time. And hopefully we did some good, too.\u201d\n\nNEVER SHOW FEAR\n\nI know that a lot of Republicans didn\u2019t like how John voted on the two attempts to repeal Obamacare. But his votes were consistent with the robust values that he articulated in his extraordinary speech to the Senate.\n\nIn that speech, John also turned his focus to America\u2019s important role in the world\n\n\u201cAmerica,\u201d he said, \u201chas made a greater contribution than any other nation to an international order that has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have been the greatest example, the greatest supporter, and the greatest defender of that order.\u201d\n\nHe brought it home with the indomitable American spirit: \u201cWe aren\u2019t afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t covet other people\u2019s land and wealth. We don\u2019t hide behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity. What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the dignity of all human beings, and their right to freedom and equal justice?\u201d\n\nThose ideals were not just rhetoric for John. He lived them throughout his public service. I know because when we traveled we always met with freedom fighters and dissidents. And we regularly introduced resolutions condemning tyranny and supporting those fighting it on just about every continent.\n\nI will never forget being with John in Myanmar and meeting three young political dissidents who had just been released from a government prison.\n\nThey all bore the scars of incarceration, but said that one of the reasons they survived was that they learned that Sen. John McCain had spoken on their behalf on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\nThose champions of liberty will never forget the inspiring words and deeds that characterized the remarkable American life of John McCain.\n\nNeither shall we.\n\nThis is modified version of a story first published as the December 2017 cover story of Newsmax Magazine.
