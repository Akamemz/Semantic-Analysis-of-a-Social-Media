If true, such a report would be absolutely horrifying. But as with much of what we read, quite simply, it is not true.\n\nThe hysteria was caused by partisan Democrats mistakenly linking to a 2014 article in The Arizona Republic, thinking that the photos in the article were current. Trump Derangement Syndrome led to a textbook self-own by the left. As is the case these days, the outrage outran the facts.\n\nWhat is the real story?\n\nUnaccompanied alien children (UAC) enter the country, and when they are apprehended, current law and court precedent requires that they be transferred into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services through their Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). The law then requires the department to quickly locate a parent, relative or sponsor to take in the children.\n\nAccording to HHS Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan, \u201capproximately 90 percent of the children\u2019s sponsors are parents or close relatives, and, historically, ORR has not tracked children once released.\u201d\n\nBut in 2016, ORR began proactively and voluntarily calling sponsors one month after placing the unaccompanied minors with them, to inquire whether additional assistance was needed.\n\nThe statistic published in The Arizona Republic that \u201cthe feds lost \u2014 yes, lost \u2014 1,475 migrant children,\u201d is false.\n\nIn a recent report, 14 percent of those called did not respond.

Of course not.\n\nBecause this is a manufactured controversy.\n\nImmediately, Rep.
