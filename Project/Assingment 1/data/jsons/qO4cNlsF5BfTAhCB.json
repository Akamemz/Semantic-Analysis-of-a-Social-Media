    "content": "Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller , two of the most powerful voices in President Donald Trump \u2019 s inner circle , were never strongly behind Andy Puzder as labor secretary , believing he was too soft on immigration .\nSo when Puzder \u2019 s nomination was teetering on the brink of implosion in recent weeks , that lack of support from the president \u2019 s top aides left Puzder , whose backing was already eroding in the Senate , with little choice but to withdraw his name , according to two sources close to Puzder .\nEven though Puzder had all the right credentials \u2014 major Republican donor , backed by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus , and strong support from the business community \u2014 his past support for more moderate immigration reform put him on the wrong side of the more radical anti-immigration forces in the Trump administration , according to sources close to the situation . More important , revelations \u2014 first reported by \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2014 that Puzder \u2019 s ex-wife had gone on `` The Oprah Winfrey Show '' with allegations that he abused her in the 1980s moved a critical number of wavering Republican senators to the `` no '' column .\nThe Puzder saga came to a quick end Wednesday afternoon when he dropped out from contention to run the Labor Department , the day before he was scheduled to appear in front of several less-than-sympathetic Republican and Democratic senators at his confirmation hearing . Losing a labor secretary nominee within 48 hours of losing an NSC chairman only increased the sense of dysfunction in the 28-day-old Trump administration .\nBannon and Miller distrusted Puzder because of his prior stance in favor of robust immigration , a position that reflected Puzder 's business interests as chairman of the parent company of Hardee 's and Carl 's Jr. , which depend heavily on immigrant food workers .\n`` They [ Bannon and Miller ] predicted this , '' said a source close to the situation . `` They said his confirmation was going to be a problem before they made the announcement . ''\nWhite House Spokesman Sean Spicer said at a briefing Wednesday that Trump would not issue a statement on Puzder . In his own statement , Puzder said : \u201c While I wo n't be serving in the administration , I fully support the president and his highly qualified team . \u201d\nIt was mainly the potency of the immigration issue that weighed Puzder down when the Huffington Post reported that he 'd employed an undocumented worker for several years ( and did n't bother to pay back taxes until after he was nominated ) . A labor nominee , Linda Chavez , under President George W. Bush withdrew under much less damning circumstances .\nAs word spread Wednesday that Puzder was out , anti-immigration groups expressed their delight . The conservative National Review editorialized against Puzder 's nomination earlier Wednesday because he `` has been a reliable font of clich\u00e9s in favor of higher levels of legal immigration . ''\nAnother problem for Puzder was Senate Republicans ' mounting exasperation with the daily fiascoes emanating from the Trump White House . `` They 're about out of political capital , '' one Senate GOP staffer said of the White House . `` Every day , they seem to be making it harder for us . They 're in a spot where they have to pick their battles . ''\nTwo weeks ago , in a meeting with Senate GOP communications staffers , Kellyanne Conway shrugged off one participant 's complaint that the White House was n't providing enough cover as congressional Republicans defended Trump 's Cabinet picks against a surge of constituent phone calls opposing them . Conway asserted , correctly , that many of the calls against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ' nomination were being orchestrated by teachers ' unions , saying that it did n't affect `` real people .

Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) . `` People made their mind up that they were not going to be part of a hearing . And I understand that .

Puzder said he did n't oppose a minimum-wage increase in principle , but opposed an increase to $ 10.10 , a goal congressional Democrats have long since abandoned in favor of $ 12 or $ 15 . Puzder also opposed a rule issued under President Barack Obama that would extend eligibility for overtime pay to four million additional workers . The rule is currently in legal limbo after a federal judge halted its implementation in November .\nPuzder 's fast-food problem was compounded when a 2011 speech surfaced in which he called his fast-food workers `` the best of the worst '' and sometimes `` the worst of the worst .
