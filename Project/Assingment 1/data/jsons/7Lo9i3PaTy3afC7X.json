Her loyal defenders spent most of Tuesday pouring out their fury on Karl Rove for remarks Rove made about her health and fitness for office . If she wins , Clinton would be 69 when she took the oath of office , older than every president other than Ronald Reagan . A Republican strategist and Fox News Contributor pointing out that Clinton \u2019 s 2013 bout of ill health , subsequent cranial blood clot and odd therapeutic eye ware at the height of the Benghazi scandal shouldn \u2019 t cause such consternation . But Democrats have long had a Rove bugaboo , ascribing many dark arts to the architect of George W. Bush \u2019 s two presidential victories . But its more than just hating Rove . It \u2019 s that he spoke to the fear pulsating in every Democratic nerve ending : What if she can \u2019 t run ?

This is a key constituency for Clinton \u2019 s candidacy , who can be expected to further distance herself from President Obama on the subject , as she did in March speech before another Jewish organization . Clinton will also continue to crusade for women rights at a World Bank discussion this evening of a report focusing on barriers to shared prosperity for women and girls the organization will release later today . The message here isn \u2019 t just taking care of her base with Jewish Voters and Wall Street . Because of what Rove said , it \u2019 s also about showing that she can endure the brutal schedule of a modern presidential candidate .\nBubba triangulates - Former President Bill Clinton starts his day in DC with an address at the 2014 Fiscal Summit hosted by the much maligned by liberals Peter G.

Addressing that question , the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) ruled on Thursday that citizens do have a certain \u2018 right to be forgotten \u2019 online\u2026That might all sound reasonable , as we all have parts of our past we \u2019 d like the Internet to forget , but there 's a problem here : Who decides what information can be deleted and what information should be preserved ? Where 's the limit ? \u201d\nObama Job Approval : Approve \u2013 44.6 percent//Disapprove \u2013 51.6 percent\nDirection of Country : Right Direction \u2013 27.9 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 63 percent\nGeneric Congressional Ballot : Democrats \u2013 43.3 percent// Republicans 43.8 percent\nRoll Call : \u201c The co-founder of and chief strategist for one of the biggest tea party organizations is coming out in support of overhauling the nation \u2019 s immigration laws , a bold statement that could energize advocates and alienate conservatives . Sal Russo of the Tea Party Express broke the news in an op-ed titled \u2018 Conservatives Need to Fix the Broken Immigration System , \u2019 published by CQ Roll Call early Wednesday morning . In that piece , the longtime GOP operative and consultant argued that \u2018 conservatives should be at the forefront of reform so the law reflects the just interests of the United States , not misty-eyed ideals of some of the liberal do-gooder reformers \u2019 \u2026 \u2018 We have to get them right by the law in exchange for legal status , but not unbridled amnesty , \u201d Russo wrote . \u201c This should include penalties , background checks to root out criminals , and the requirement that they learn English , understand the Constitution and be committed to our basic freedoms \u2019 \u2026Russo \u2019 s support for a comprehensive immigration fix that includes a legal status pathway \u2014 plus his suggestion that \u2018 conservatives need to seize on immigration reform \u2019 in order to \u2018 reaffirm who we are and what makes our country great \u2019 \u2014 is likely to raise eyebrows on all sides of the immigration debate . \u201d\nRepublican Ben Sasse is all but certain to go on to win the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Mike Johanns , R-Neb . But what kind of senator would the very conservative Sasse be ? Sasse shares a lot in common with Tea Party Caucus members Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , and Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , who both endorsed Sasse when he was still the underdog in the Nebraska race : an impressive educational resume , an iconoclastic streak and significant service in key policy posts . But Sasse also made clear on Tuesday that he doesn \u2019 t see his principle purpose in the Senate as upsetting the Republican leadership , even if those same leaders tried to keep him out of office . The hint as to what to expect from a prospective Senator Sasse came in his Tuesday victory speech and a background briefing from his strategy team . The names dropped included Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , and former Rep. Jack Kemp , R-N.Y . Both are conservative icons , but of a wonkish , not fiery populist , sort . So is this going to be another guy who gets raves at American Enterprise Institute panels but always gets a suspicious eye from the base ? Probably not . The role model for Sasse is Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla. Coburn \u2019 s low-key endorsement early in the race was a pivotal moment for Sasse , and he was eager to highlight their similarities .\n[ Skin in the game - Pete Ricketts , the son of conservative mega donor and founder of TD AmeriTrade , Joe Ricketts , secured the GOP nomination for governor . Cruz had also endorsed the younger Ricketts . More . ]\nThey still say yes to Dr. No - Coburn , who has often frustrated conservative orthodoxy with votes like the one to bail out Wall Street during the Panic of 2008 , will still leave the Senate at the end of this year as a conservative hero . How ? Like Sasse , Coburn had to bust the establishment to win his primary but then did not come to town looking for revenge . He had his credibility as an outsider , but didn \u2019 t nurture the grievance . Coburn was also willing to pay a heavy personal price for the issues that mattered to him , and will walk away from the Senate having effectively killed the practice of earmarking . Dr. No euthanized that patient for sure . And neither is Coburn willing to subordinate his policy goals to his partisan loyalties . And one place where Coburn has adamantly refused to compromise has been on his stalwart pro-life stance , a view shared by Sasse . In short , Coburn is an ornery fellow . And that \u2019 s why conservatives love and trust him . Sasse is looking to inhabit that space and do so on the issue of ObamaCare . Those are some mighty big shoes he \u2019 s looking to fill . If Sasse wants to try them on , he \u2019 d better be ready for some blisters .\n[ Watch Fox : National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Sen. Jerry Moran , R-Kans. , appears in the 2 p.m . ET hour ]\nThe most remarkable story out of the West Virginia Senate primary on Tuesday was that nothing remarkable happened . Despite lots of threats that moderate Rep. Shelly Moore Capito , R-W.Va. , would get waylaid by a tea-party primary challenge , no such thing materialized . Credit this to a good campaign by Capito , who has obviously inherited her father \u2019 s gift for campaigns and elections . But it also represents a continuing trend of Republican primary voters staying focused on a Senate majority before considering ideological purity . Had a little-known candidate emerged on the GOP side in West Virginia , Secretary of State Natalie Tennant , who also easily took the Democratic nomination , would have been in a good position to replace retiring Sen. Jay Rockefeller , D-W.Va . But as it stands , Capito is chugging toward what looks to be a clear victory in November .\nBut sometimes the best candidates are the outsiders - The former chairman of the Maryland GOP Alex Mooney claimed victory Tuesday night in a crowded Republican primary for West Virginia 's 2nd District to replace Rep. Shelley Moore Capito . Mooney beat longtime Republican official Charlotte Lane in the primary . While Mooney may cause some headaches for Capito by highlighting policy differences , he looks to be a much more viable candidate in the fall against the Democratic nominee , former state party Chairman Nick Casey .\nBig Ugly race \u2013 Veteran Rep. Nick Joe Rahall , D-W.Va. , won his 20th consecutive primary on Tuesday . But the news was not good overall for the embattled incumbent . Rahall lost more than a third of the primary vote to a first-time , unfunded candidate , retired Army Maj. Richard Ojeda . Now Rahall must face Republican state lawmaker Evan Jenkins , a former Democrat who switched parties last year , in the general election in the fall . Looks bad for Rahall , an early endorser of then-Sen. Barack Obama , who is now less popular in the Mountain State than the Pitt Panthers .\nNew Orleans Times-Picayune : \u201c The Mary Landrieu campaign is back up Tuesday with another TV ad , this one featuring her well-known father , Moon , describing his daughter as a fighter\u2026 Moon Landrieu says in the 30-second ad that \u2018 I know how BP felt when Mary fought to get billions for Louisiana , \u2019 and how she \u2018 took on the president \u2019 to try and get the Keystone XL Pipeline approved . \u2018 And now you know why Putin wo n't let her into Russia , \u2019 Moon Landrieu says about her daughter 's name appearing on a list of eight U.S. officials sanctioned by President Vladimir Putin in response to U.S. sanctions after Russian intervention in Ukraine . Mary Landrieu shakes her head in response . \u201d\n[ WSJ : \u201c If Ms. Landrieu really had Keystone as a top priority , as she claims , she 'd have joined Republicans in demanding an immediate amendment to a bill that she knows the White House is reluctant to veto . And she 'd have insisted that \u2026 [ Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ] allow a 50-vote threshold for passage , rather than Mr. Reid 's 60-vote supermajority . Ms. Landrieu instead is playing Mr. Reid 's double game , demanding a Keystone vote even as she undermines its passage . She is running for election by boasting about her clout as the new Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee , but she is so ineffectual that she ca n't get her own party to allow a vote on what she claims is one of her top priorities . \u201d ]\nThe Hill : \u201c Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel ( R ) has almost pulled even with businessman David Perdue ( R ) , according to an internal poll for Handel 's campaign obtained by The Hill . Perdue leads Handel by 22 percent to 20 percent with 18 percent for Rep. Jack Kingston ( R-Ga. ) , 11 percent for Rep. Paul Broun ( R-Ga. ) and 7 percent for Rep. Phil Gingrey ( R-Ga. ) , according to an automated poll conducted by Rosetta Stone . The top two vote winners in the May 20 primary will face off in a July 22 runoff , but the new poll shows it 's really become a fierce battle between Perdue , Handel and Kingston for those top slots to advance . \u201d\nThe Hill : \u201c The Chamber of Commerce and National Rifle Association have both endorsed Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst ( R ) in a GOP primary for an open Iowa Senate seat . The endorsement from the leading business group and the powerful gun lobby give Ernst a boost as she battles businessman Mark Jacobs and two other candidates in the primary\u2026she 's still short on money , and the Chamber has spent heavily to back its preferred candidates in other primaries . If they put ads in Iowa behind Ernst , it could help boost her ahead of the June 3 primary . The winner of the primary will face Rep. Bruce Braley ( D-Iowa ) in the swing state . \u201d\nNational Journal : \u201c Alaska is about to get hit by a wave . Just this week , Democratic outside groups plunked down $ 7.5 million worth of reservations for fall TV advertising supporting Democratic Sen. Mark Begich , a huge amount of money for a state where media comes relatively cheap . Just by itself , the new reservation more than doubles the total outside spending in Alaska in 2008 , when Begich won his Senate seat . Put Alaska First , a super PAC backing Begich and largely financed by another Washington-based group , announced on Monday plans to reserve $ 4 million in airtime , according to Alaska Dispatch , while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is also preparing to spend $ 3.5 million in the same post-Labor Day time period , Politico reported . \u201d\nRepublicans need a net gain of six seats to capture control of the Senate this year .

Addressing that question, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on Thursday that citizens do have a certain \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019 online\u2026That might all sound reasonable, as we all have parts of our past we\u2019d like the Internet to forget, but there's a problem here: Who decides what information can be deleted and what information should be preserved?

Sal Russo of the Tea Party Express broke the news in an op-ed titled \u2018Conservatives Need to Fix the Broken Immigration System,\u2019 published by CQ Roll Call early Wednesday morning. In that piece, the longtime GOP operative and consultant argued that \u2018conservatives should be at the forefront of reform so the law reflects the just interests of the United States, not misty-eyed ideals of some of the liberal do-gooder reformers\u2019\u2026 \u2018We have to get them right by the law in exchange for legal status, but not unbridled amnesty,\u201d Russo wrote. \u201cThis should include penalties, background checks to root out criminals, and the requirement that they learn English, understand the Constitution and be committed to our basic freedoms\u2019\u2026Russo\u2019s support for a comprehensive immigration fix that includes a legal status pathway \u2014 plus his suggestion that \u2018conservatives need to seize on immigration reform\u2019 in order to \u2018reaffirm who we are and what makes our country great\u2019 \u2014 is likely to raise eyebrows on all sides of the immigration debate.\u201d\n\nSASSE LOOKS TO FILL COBURN\u2019S SHOES\n\nRepublican Ben Sasse is all but certain to go on to win the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb. But what kind of senator would the very conservative Sasse be? Sasse shares a lot in common with Tea Party Caucus members Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who both endorsed Sasse when he was still the underdog in the Nebraska race: an impressive educational resume, an iconoclastic streak and significant service in key policy posts. But Sasse also made clear on Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t see his principle purpose in the Senate as upsetting the Republican leadership, even if those same leaders tried to keep him out of office. The hint as to what to expect from a prospective Senator Sasse came in his Tuesday victory speech and a background briefing from his strategy team. The names dropped included Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and former Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y. Both are conservative icons, but of a wonkish, not fiery populist, sort. So is this going to be another guy who gets raves at American Enterprise Institute panels but always gets a suspicious eye from the base? Probably not. The role model for Sasse is Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. Coburn\u2019s low-key endorsement early in the race was a pivotal moment for Sasse, and he was eager to highlight their similarities.\n\n\n\n[Skin in the game - Pete Ricketts, the son of conservative mega donor and founder of TD AmeriTrade, Joe Ricketts, secured the GOP nomination for governor. Cruz had also endorsed the younger Ricketts. More.]\n\nThey still say yes to Dr. No - Coburn, who has often frustrated conservative orthodoxy with votes like the one to bail out Wall Street during the Panic of 2008, will still leave the Senate at the end of this year as a conservative hero. How? Like Sasse, Coburn had to bust the establishment to win his primary but then did not come to town looking for revenge. He had his credibility as an outsider, but didn\u2019t nurture the grievance. Coburn was also willing to pay a heavy personal price for the issues that mattered to him, and will walk away from the Senate having effectively killed the practice of earmarking. Dr. No euthanized that patient for sure. And neither is Coburn willing to subordinate his policy goals to his partisan loyalties. And one place where Coburn has adamantly refused to compromise has been on his stalwart pro-life stance, a view shared by Sasse. In short, Coburn is an ornery fellow. And that\u2019s why conservatives love and trust him. Sasse is looking to inhabit that space and do so on the issue of ObamaCare. Those are some mighty big shoes he\u2019s looking to fill. If Sasse wants to try them on, he\u2019d better be ready for some blisters.\n\n[Watch Fox: National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kans., appears in the 2 p.m. ET hour]\n\nAN AMAZING YAWNER IN WEST VIRGINIA\n\nThe most remarkable story out of the West Virginia Senate primary on Tuesday was that nothing remarkable happened. Despite lots of threats that moderate Rep. Shelly Moore Capito, R-W.Va., would get waylaid by a tea-party primary challenge, no such thing materialized. Credit this to a good campaign by Capito, who has obviously inherited her father\u2019s gift for campaigns and elections. But it also represents a continuing trend of Republican primary voters staying focused on a Senate majority before considering ideological purity. Had a little-known candidate emerged on the GOP side in West Virginia, Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, who also easily took the Democratic nomination, would have been in a good position to replace retiring Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. But as it stands, Capito is chugging toward what looks to be a clear victory in November.\n\nBut sometimes the best candidates are the outsiders - The former chairman of the Maryland GOP Alex Mooney claimed victory Tuesday night in a crowded Republican primary for West Virginia's 2nd District to replace Rep. Shelley Moore Capito. Mooney beat longtime Republican official Charlotte Lane in the primary. While Mooney may cause some headaches for Capito by highlighting policy differences, he looks to be a much more viable candidate in the fall against the Democratic nominee, former state party Chairman Nick Casey.\n\nBig Ugly race \u2013 Veteran Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., won his 20th consecutive primary on Tuesday. But the news was not good overall for the embattled incumbent. Rahall lost more than a third of the primary vote to a first-time, unfunded candidate, retired Army Maj. Richard Ojeda. Now Rahall must face Republican state lawmaker Evan Jenkins, a former Democrat who switched parties last year, in the general election in the fall. Looks bad for Rahall, an early endorser of then-Sen. Barack Obama, who is now less popular in the Mountain State than the Pitt Panthers.\n\nLANDRIEU DEPLOYS DAD IN NEW AD\n\nNew Orleans Times-Picayune: \u201cThe Mary Landrieu campaign is back up Tuesday with another TV ad, this one featuring her well-known father, Moon, describing his daughter as a fighter\u2026 Moon Landrieu says in the 30-second ad that \u2018I know how BP felt when Mary fought to get billions for Louisiana,\u2019 and how she \u2018took on the president\u2019 to try and get the Keystone XL Pipeline approved. \u2018And now you know why Putin won't let her into Russia,\u2019 Moon Landrieu says about her daughter's name appearing on a list of eight U.S. officials sanctioned by President Vladimir Putin in response to U.S. sanctions after Russian intervention in Ukraine. Mary Landrieu shakes her head in response.\u201d\n\n[WSJ: \u201cIf Ms. Landrieu really had Keystone as a top priority, as she claims, she'd have joined Republicans in demanding an immediate amendment to a bill that she knows the White House is reluctant to veto. And she'd have insisted that \u2026[Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid] allow a 50-vote threshold for passage, rather than Mr. Reid's 60-vote supermajority. Ms. Landrieu instead is playing Mr. Reid's double game, demanding a Keystone vote even as she undermines its passage. She is running for election by boasting about her clout as the new Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, but she is so ineffectual that she can't get her own party to allow a vote on what she claims is one of her top priorities.\u201d]\n\nPOLL: HANDEL SLIPS PAST KINGSTON IN GEORGIA SENATE\n\nThe Hill: \u201cFormer Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel (R) has almost pulled even with businessman David Perdue (R), according to an internal poll for Handel's campaign obtained by The Hill. Perdue leads Handel by 22 percent to 20 percent with 18 percent for Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), 11 percent for Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) and 7 percent for Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.), according to an automated poll conducted by Rosetta Stone. The top two vote winners in the May 20 primary will face off in a July 22 runoff, but the new poll shows it's really become a fierce battle between Perdue, Handel and Kingston for those top slots to advance.\u201d\n\nERNST RACKING UP SUPPORT FROM CONSERVATIVES AND MODERATES\n\nThe Hill: \u201cThe Chamber of Commerce and National Rifle Association have both endorsed Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst (R) in a GOP primary for an open Iowa Senate seat. The endorsement from the leading business group and the powerful gun lobby give Ernst a boost as she battles businessman Mark Jacobs and two other candidates in the primary\u2026she's still short on money, and the Chamber has spent heavily to back its preferred candidates in other primaries. If they put ads in Iowa behind Ernst, it could help boost her ahead of the June 3 primary. The winner of the primary will face Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) in the swing state.\u201d\n\nBEGICH BACKERS LOOK TO DROWN OUT RIVALS\n\nNational Journal: \u201cAlaska is about to get hit by a wave. Just this week, Democratic outside groups plunked down $7.5 million worth of reservations for fall TV advertising supporting Democratic Sen. Mark Begich, a huge amount of money for a state where media comes relatively cheap. Just by itself, the new reservation more than doubles the total outside spending in Alaska in 2008, when Begich won his Senate seat. Put Alaska First, a super PAC backing Begich and largely financed by another Washington-based group, announced on Monday plans to reserve $4 million in airtime, according to Alaska Dispatch, while the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is also preparing to spend $3.5 million in the same post-Labor Day time period, Politico reported.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX: SHOULD THE 35TH STATE BE NUMBER ONE?\n\nRepublicans need a net gain of six seats to capture control of the Senate this year.

David Jolly, [R-Fla.], in Pinellas County's Congressional District 13, is dropping out of the race. The sudden and surprise announcement comes days after a Tampa Bay Times report about him seemingly padding his educational background and resume\u2026 \u2018Words cannot describe what an epic failure this congressional race has become for the DCCC and Florida Democrats,\u2019 crowed National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Katie Prill. \u2018After a devastating loss and wasting millions in the special election, one thing remains very clear: President Obama\u2019s toxic agenda has cost the DCCC another seat that they couldn\u2019t afford to lose.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nConyers fails to qualify for primary ballot - AP: \u201cLongtime Congressman John Conyers of Michigan doesn't have enough signatures to appear on the Aug. 5 primary ballot, an elections official announced Tuesday\u2026 The 84-year-old Detroit Democrat was at risk because officials believe several people who signed his petitions do not appear to have been registered voters or had registered too late. Conyers has three days to appeal \u2026[the] ruling to the Michigan Secretary of State.\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Yes, but\u2026 the odds are very high that Conyers would win as a write-in candidate. He has been in Congress since 1965, has a largely unknown primary rival and represents a district that President Obama won by 70 points in 2012. Filling petitions that appear to have only 600 out of 2,000 valid signatures is certainly an embarrassment and will necessitate the 85-year-old incumbent to actually campaign this time, but the largest consequence here is likely that this bungle will siphon time and resources from Michigan Democrats\u2019 struggling senatorial and gubernatorial campaigns. But it\u2019s not like Conyers hasn\u2019t been embarrassed and still won before. Remember, this is a man who twice won re-election with his wife in prison for taking bribes as a city councilwoman.]\n\nOWN THE BAR WHERE IT\u2019S NEVER LADIES\u2019 NIGHT\u2026\n\nFor Trekkers willing to part with $35 million, they can own a life-size replica of the set on which the character Capt.
