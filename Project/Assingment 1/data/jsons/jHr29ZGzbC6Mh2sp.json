Election Day saw a steady flow of pilgrims to the gravesite of suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony .

Still-fresh anger over some of the abuse she was subjected to helped to drive turnout to the women \u2019 s march in Washington this weekend .\nOnly 100 years ago , many people found the idea of a woman voting degrading\nIt \u2019 s difficult for many people to imagine the mindset in which it seemed natural and obvious for women to be excluded from politics\nBut suffrage for women represented a challenge to centuries of established political thought . The central justification was the conviction that women are by their very nature unfit for political life . The political realm was inherently masculine , while the private realm of home and family was the women \u2019 s place . The ideal of separate spheres has shown remarkable endurance . As late as 1961 , the United States Supreme Court maintained in Hoyt v. Florida that states could reasonably exclude women from jury duty because women were \u201c the center of home and family life \u201d and this obligation should not be neglected .\nFor opponents of suffrage , masculinity , rationality , and power were intrinsically linked , while helplessness , sentiment , and dependence were defining characteristics of femininity . This self-evident reality was articulated by writer Octavius B. Frothingham in 1890 :\nThe masculine represents judgment , the practicable , the expedient , the possible , while the feminine represents emotion , what ought to be \u2026 The predominance of sentiment in woman renders her essentially an idealist .\nThe political arena was a corrupt and rancorous place .
