Supposedly , Mr. Trump called her to his room at a resort in the western U.S . He then kissed her . Did not have sex . Nothing involved with the digestive tract . No threesomes . No lesbian . Nothing . She then returned to her room and , supposedly , was called by Mr. Trump or someone acting on his behalf , and offered $ 10,000 to come to his room . She was also offered a ride to wherever she was heading on his jet . She indignantly refused , according to her lawyer , the ever-present Gloria Allred , wearing her ever-present pink Chanel jacket at an indignant press conference . ( She is said to be a wealthy woman . She must have more clothes than that . I guess it \u2019 s just a favorite . I know I wear the same navy blazer all of the time . )\nNow , \u201c Jessica Drake \u201d did not report it , whatever \u201c it \u201d is , for ten years . \u201c Miss Drake \u201d used to get , as I am told , about $ 2,000 for having extremely odd sex on camera with total strangers . And we are supposed to believe that she turned down TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS to have sex with a famous businessman , without even having to have cameras there or lights or anything ? Maybe not even to have sex . Just to come to his room .\nAs a smart 27-year-old woman who knows something about sex abuse told me tonight , \u201c Yeah , right . Try that lie on someone else . \u201d\nBut maybe it \u2019 s true . Jessica Drake says she has done some magnificent anonymous \u2014 of course \u2014 charity work and maybe she \u2019 s as pure as the driven snow now and was 10 years ago ( although that is not what one gathers from her bio , which clearly says she was and is extremely busy in the sex business and has made anal sex her particular specialty for some years now ) . Maybe she \u2019 s the saint of deviant sex . Again , where \u2019 s the crime here ? A man offers a woman a gift for private , consensual sex . It \u2019 s not like curing AIDS but , again , where is the crime there ? It happens all day long . The crime would be if she worked for him when he was governor or attorney general of a southern state , and he raped her , and then his wife threatened her kids and her if she came forward with the story . Naturally , that story does not get covered except in the \u201c alt right \u201d press . I guess I am just stupid , but I don \u2019 t see serious misconduct here in the life of Jessica Drake .\n( By the way , the crime of sex abuse is when a woman \u2019 s former boyfriend chokes her into unconsciousness and threatens to kill her if she reports it to the police . That \u2019 s the story of my beautiful 27-year-old friend . She reported what happened to the district attorney of the small town where she lived . The DA did nothing . That \u2019 s sex abuse . )\nMeanwhile , the MSM is full of stories of the \u201c total meltdown \u201d of the GOP . It \u2019 s bad all right . It \u2019 s extremely bad , and I really wish my pal from South Carolina , Lindsey Graham , were the nominee . But the total meltdown has been of the mainstream media . Foaming at the mouth about Donald Trump asking a sex star to come to his room while tens of thousands die in Aleppo because our President backed out on his red lines . Now , the MSM has reached a new low with its refusal to acknowledge that when Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump in Debate Three of purposely colluding with Putin to alter the U.S. election , she was committing textbook libel : a damaging falsehood about a public figure spoken or written intentionally , knowing that it is false or uttered with such contempt and negligence that there might as well be specific intent .\nBut Mrs. Clinton totally got away with it . I know Mr. Trump loves to sue people . Let \u2019 s see him sue HRC for libel over that after she \u2019 s in the Oval Office . Public figures are not immune from libel actions . A well-heeled plaintiff can go after them . Go for it , Donald ! Trump it !",
