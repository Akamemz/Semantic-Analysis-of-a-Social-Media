( AP Photo/ Evan Vucci )\nATLANTA ( AP ) \u2014 During the 2016 campaign , candidate Donald Trump stood in front of largely white crowds and asked black voters to consider , \u201c What the hell do you have to lose ? \u201d\nTrump offered that same message Friday as he launched a black voters coalition in Atlanta , Georgia . While Trump \u2019 s campaign had said his message would focus on his record and gains for black Americans under his watch , Trump instead spent most of his time demonizing Democrats and appearing to try to pit minority voters against immigrants .\n\u201c The Democrats have let you down , \u201d Trump told the crowd of several hundred supporters , including several who wore red \u201c BLACK LIVES MAGA \u201d hats . \u201c They \u2019 ve dismissed you . They \u2019 ve hurt you . They \u2019 ve sabotaged you for far too long . \u201d\nTrump spoke at the launch of a new \u201c Black Voices for Trump \u201d outreach initiative dedicated to \u201c recruiting and activating Black Americans in support of President Trump , \u201d according to the campaign .\nTrump predicted he would win reelection in 2020 with \u201c a groundswell of support from hardworking African American patriots . \u201d\nSuch prediction have been met with skepticism from critics , however , given Trump \u2019 s consistently dismal approval rating with black voters .\nTrump has spent much of the last four years engaged in racially charged attacks , going after minority members of Congress , claiming \u201c no human being \u201d would want to live in \u201c rodent infested , \u201d majority-minority Baltimore and insisting there were \u201c very fine people on both sides \u201d of the deadly Charlottesville protest against white supremacists .\nShortly after landing in Georgia on Friday , Trump retweeted a call from one black supporter for submissions for a \u201d # MAGACHALLENGE \u201d competition featuring Trump-friendly rap songs . Trump said he would be announcing the winners and inviting them to the White House to meet with him and perform .\n\u201c I think black Americans are not the audience for these outreach efforts , \u201d said Theodore Johnson , a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who is an expert in race and politics . While Trump might be able to maintain the low level of black support he received in 2016 , or perhaps expand it by 1 or 2 points , Johnson sees little evidence the president can change many minds .\n\u201c I think this is not going to move the needle at all , \u201d he said .\nBefore launching the new effort , Trump met with supporters at a fundraiser that was expected to raise about $ 3.5 million for a joint committee benefiting the Republican National Committee , the Trump campaign and the campaign of Sen. David Perdue , R-Ga . Nearby , a small group of protesters chanted , \u201c Lock him up ! \u201d\nScores of protesters also gathered outside the convention center where Trump was speaking , chanting , \u201c Impeach and remove . \u201d\nCarl Dix , of the group Refuse Fascism , said he thought the launch was aimed at trying to send a message to Trump \u2019 s white supporters that he \u2019 s \u201c not a racist . \u2018 I \u2019 ve got black friends . \u2019 \u201d\nIn 2016 , 6 % of black voters supported Trump , according to a Pew Research Center analysis of people who participated in its polls and were confirmed to have voted . There is no indication his support is growing . Polling shows that African Americans continue to be overwhelmingly negative in their assessments of the president \u2019 s performance , with his approval hovering around 1 in 10 over the course of his presidency , according to Gallup .\nYet Trump \u2019 s campaign dismissed the numbers , insisting the campaign has seen favorable movement and arguing the president can increase his margins with black voters by bringing new people into the fold .\n\u201c The polls have never been favorable for Trump , and the only poll that matters is on Election Day , \u201d said senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson .\nThe campaign has launched similar coalitions for women , Latinos and veterans .\nDarrell Scott , a black Ohio pastor and a longtime supporter of the president who is co-chair of the new coalition and spoke at Friday \u2019 s event , said that in 2015 and 2016 , supporters trying to sell Trump to black voters could only point forward to things they anticipated from Trump .\n\u201c Now that it \u2019 s 2020 , we \u2019 re able to point backwards and to some very definitive accomplishments that the president has done , \u201d Scott said . \u201c He delivered on promises he didn \u2019 t even make . \u201d\nDuring his remarks , Trump pointed to passage of bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation , which Trump signed into law last year , along with his ongoing support for opportunity zones in urban areas and new investments in historically black colleges .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know anyone who \u2019 s done that kind of work outside of the president on attacking those big issues or trying to stop drugs from coming into the neighborhood and , at the same time , giving people second chances , \u201d said Ja \u2019 Ron Smith , deputy assistant to the president and one of the White House \u2019 s few minority high-ranked officials .\nHe also pointed to a series of economic gains , including the fact that black unemployment hit a record low last year , with fewer blacks living in poverty .
