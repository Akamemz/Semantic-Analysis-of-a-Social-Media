But his donation to America First Action in early 2018 afforded him a new level of access to exclusive high-dollar events .\nParnas has since acquainted himself with a host of President Trump \u2019 s wealthy supporters at close-door donor events , and then touted those very connections to pursue his personal business interests as well as political interests . During an interview on CNN , Parnas said he had so many photos of himself with Trump-world insiders hanging in his house , his wife thought it looked like a \u201c shrine \u201d to the President .\nIn 2018 , Parnas cultivated a relationship and secured a $ 500,000 loan from New York-based lawyer and Trump donor Charles Gucciardo , his attorney told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Gucciardo 's lawyer Randy Zelin said his client then gave the money to Giuliani , which kicked off the business relationship between the two in the fall of 2018 . No apparent connection has been made between Gucciardo \u2019 s loan and Parnas 's specific efforts in Ukraine .\nZelin told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that his client made the payment as a `` passive investor '' in Parnas and Fruman \u2019 s company , called Fraud Guarantee , and that he decided to invest in the company because of an endorsement from Giuliani .\n`` Mr. Gucciardo invested because he believed that Mr. Giuliani \u2013 the former Mayor of New York City ; former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York ; and , the first name in cybersecurity -- was in front of , behind , and alongside the Company which would catapult the Company into the world of cybersecurity and investor protection , '' Zelin said in an email .\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a statement this week the additional documents corroborate a matter central to the congressional impeachment against the president : Parnas ' alleged scheme to `` coerce Ukraine into helping cheat him in the next election . ''\n`` The additional documents and information about potential witnesses that have become available over the last several weeks only underscore the importance of a fair trial and a Senate that is open to hearing all of the evidence , '' Schiff said in the statement .\nSen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn. , also stressed the importance of calling witnesses in the upcoming Senate trial in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` This is how criminal conspiracies work : Everyone is committing crimes and eventually those implementing the crimes turn in those who ordered it from the top , '' Murphy said in the statement . `` Everything Lev Parnas has said thus far lines up with what we 've heard throughout the House investigation , but if the White House and Republicans believe differently , they should actually call witnesses and additional documents so we can hold a real trial .
