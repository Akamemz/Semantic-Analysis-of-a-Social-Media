It was just another quick stopover in a state that demands persistent and extended attention from presidential candidates .\nInstead of the traditional one-on-one conversations at parties and handshakes in diners , New Hampshire voters are getting mostly distant waves and occasional autographs from Trump at big rallies , and they \u2019 re rewarding him nonetheless .\n\u201c Right now , Trump \u2019 s going to win New Hampshire , \u201d said Dave Carney , a longtime GOP strategist in the state who is not connected to any of the 2016 contenders . \u201c It \u2019 s a jump ball for second . \u201d\nTrump has led every poll taken here since July , and pulled in double the support of his closest competitor in four of the last five surveys . \u201c In New Hampshire , we \u2019 re really doing well , \u201d Trump relayed to the adoring crowd . \u201c Really , really , really doing well . \u201d\nThe event in northern New Hampshire was Trump \u2019 s 16th visit to the state this year . And yet not once , according to the New England Cable News candidate tracker , has he spent the night here to campaign on back-to-back days . He ferries himself to and from on his private jet .\nNew Hampshire institutionalists fret that Trump \u2019 s celebrity-based and media-fueled candidacy threatens to undermine one of the last bastions of hand-to-hand campaigning left in national politics , and the chance for underfunded underdogs to break through .\n`` We always prided ourselves on insisting on retail campaigning , \u201d said Donna Sytek , who was the first female speaker of New Hampshire \u2019 s House of Representatives . \u201c Donald Trump has turned tradition on its head . \u201d\nBut he \u2019 s not alone in dismissing the traditional New Hampshire approach , and gaining ground in the process .\nBoth Ben Carson , who until recently had been among the top contenders here , and the steadily climbing Marco Rubio have both dedicated less time to glad-handing in New Hampshire than contenders stuck at the bottom of the 2016 polling , including Jeb Bush , John Kasich and Chris Christie .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign says his popularity simply makes traditional retail campaigning all but impossible . Stephen Stepanek , co-chair of Trump \u2019 s New Hampshire campaign and a state representative , hosted Trump \u2019 s first 2015 appearance at his home in Amherst back in March . He expected a small affair ; 350 people showed up .\n\u201c It was like , after that , every time we announce [ an event ] we get literally thousands of people , \u201d Stepanek said . \u201c We would love to be able to do some of the smaller events but there \u2019 s too much demand for them . Every time we put something out there , we just get an incredible crush of people who want to see him . \u201d\nOn Tuesday , Trump packed multiples of Waterville Valley \u2019 s 247-person population into his event , even as freezing rain fell across northern New Hampshire . Trump told the crowd his own motorcade slipped on the icy roads more than once en route . He vowed to drive slower during his departure .\nSteve Duprey , New Hampshire Republican National Committeeman , said Trump is simply taking advantage of an option available to no other 2016 rival . \u201c If you ask every candidate who \u2019 s doing a town hall in front of 50 people , \u2018 You can do a rally in front of 2,000 , would you like to do it ? \u2019 Every candidate will take you up on that offer , \u201d Duprey said . Of Trump , Duprey added , \u201c His version is , \u2018 I \u2019 m doing a town hall . It \u2019 s just in front of 2,000 people . Don \u2019 t blame me because I \u2019 m beautiful . \u2019 \u201d\nTrump has drawn comparisons to endless flavor-of-the-month candidates from 2012 : Rick Perry , Michele Bachmann , Newt Gingrich and Herman Cain , who appeared alongside Trump at a rally in Georgia this week .

He doesn \u2019 t , \u201d said Carney , the GOP strategist . \u201c There \u2019 s no law of politics that the wild-assed , unsophisticated showman has to fall apart . \u201d\nStill , Trump \u2019 s rivals , especially those employing more traditional tactics , hope his big rallies will amount to a temporary sugar high and won \u2019 t engender the same level of devotion as they say they are securing through private conversations with New Hampshire \u2019 s voters .\nAcross the state from Trump \u2019 s event on Tuesday , for instance , Christie celebrated his 50th day campaigning in New Hampshire , where he has held more than 100 events . \u201c I \u2019 ve been here more than any other candidate and Mary Pat [ Christie ] has been here more than any other candidate but me so we \u2019 re thrilled to be back in New Hampshire , \u201d Christie said in a Londonderry diner .
