    "content": "This week , the troubled state of American democracy was on display in the reactions to the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio . To the establishment Left , led by the New York Times , the El Paso shooter operated as if he were a white nationalist acting on orders from Donald Trump . Some on the right , meantime , linked the Dayton shooter \u2019 s actions to Antifa . In a healthy political environment , Americans , regardless of political views , would consider these tragedies the heinous actions of disturbed people , motivated mostly by a dangerous combination of madness and ideology . But in our warped political climate , everyone assumes that their enemies want to kill them .\nOur political polarization reflects a decline in the notion of American identity . Tribalism on the left has supplanted foundational ideals of citizenship . Representative Ayanna Pressley recently insisted that blacks , Hispanics , gays , and members of other minority groups must promote identity-first politics over any notion of the common good ; failure to do so , she suggested , is a betrayal of the group . In addition , progressive Democrats have effectively championed open borders , advocating the removal of criminal penalties for border-crossers , who also would get free health care not readily available to most American citizens . Such views represent the triumph of identity politics over the civic ideal of E Pluribus Unum .\nThe Left \u2019 s positions , according to Jeh Johnson , Homeland Security secretary under Barack Obama , are \u201c unworkable , unwise , \u201d and lack support of \u201c a majority of American people or the Congress. \u201d And yet our press , cultural institutions , and universities\u2014all controlled by progressives\u2014amplify those views each day , shaping an angry younger generation with little use for citizenship , free speech , open dialogue , democracy , or capitalism . Some 40 percent of millennials , for example , favor limiting speech deemed offensive to minorities\u2014well above the 27 percent that prevails among Gen Xers , 24 percent among baby boomers , and just 12 percent among the oldest cohorts . Many millennials also dismiss basic constitutional civil rights and support socialism over free markets .\nWhile progressives seek to impose their agenda , some populist conservatives are understandably resentful at being told by 1 percenters like Beto O \u2019 Rourke that they are beneficiaries of \u201c white privilege \u201d and are members of the \u201c male patriarchy. \u201d Most Republicans , according to Pew , worry that foreigners are remaking and undermining the country \u2019 s identity . Considering the country \u2019 s demographic trajectory , this politics has a limited shelf life . A return to 1950s America is no more likely than the mass expulsion of Trump \u2019 s white \u201c deplorables . \u201d\nFighting for a robust and inclusive American identity won \u2019 t be popular with our corporate elite . \u201c Transnational class formation \u201d \u2014long linked by various parts of the industrial and financial aristocracy\u2014is becoming more pronounced .

Like feudal lords loyal to the European Christianitas , not their locale , this corporate elite increasingly identifies with global markets and a cosmopolitan , post-national worldview . Since Trump \u2019 s election , many companies , including Google , have grown reluctant to work with the U.S. military , immigration agencies , and police departments , while assisting the surveillance agenda of authoritarian China .\nGiven their post-nationalist inclinations , it \u2019 s not surprising that many corporate powers\u2014notably in tech\u2014prefer unlimited immigration . This partly reflects the non-native share of the tech workforce , which has reached 24 percent nationwide , compared with 16 percent for the rest of labor force . In Silicon Valley , the foreign share is roughly 40 percent . Though they defend open borders , tech leaders express little concern for the native-born , largely white middle class . Immigrants , suggests Steve Case , former CEO of AOL , should replace our troubled , indigenous working class .\nSuch positions invite backlash from those who live outside the charmed circle .
