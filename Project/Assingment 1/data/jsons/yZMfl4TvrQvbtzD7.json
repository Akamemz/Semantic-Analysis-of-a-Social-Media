The House passed legislation aimed at expanding association health plans in March of this year , though it was never taken up in the Senate .

In addition , the order eases restrictions on short-term health plans , which are exempt from many of Obamacare 's mandates .\nTrump 's order is intended to create less regulated , less expensive alternatives to Obamacare . It is not an attempt to unwind the law so much as to work around it , providing options that do not exist under the current scheme , which has resulted in steady and significant increases in health insurance premiums and limited health insurance choices in many parts of the country .
