    "content": "When Barack Obama met in Orlando with yet another set of anguished families who had lost loved ones in a mass shooting , there was one distressingly simple question : \u201c Why does this keep happening ? \u201d\nIt is a question asked around the world about gun violence in the United States \u2013 answered most often with a helpless shrug , and almost ritualistic manoeuvring as people on all sides take up entrenched positions .\nDoes a country with more than 30,000 gun deaths every year simply lack the will to change ? And if reform of US gun laws could not happen after the desolation of 2012 when 20 first-graders were killed at Sandy Hook elementary school , is this a nation trapped in a perpetual cycle of failure ?\nThis week , \u2588\u2588\u2588 will explore just what makes the politics of gun control so difficult . We will ask whether the assault weapons ban is the right target for reformers , why gun rights activists oppose \u201c common-sense \u201d measures , and what can be done to change the conversation in order to save American lives .\n\u201c This debate needs to change , \u201d Obama said in Orlando . What would it take \u2013 both on the left and the right \u2013 to do that ?\nNicole Hockley has been grappling with that question since her six-year-old son Dylan was shot to death in 2012 in the arms of his classroom aide .\nLast week a photograph of Dylan , smiling in a Superman T-shirt , was held up on the Senate floor , at once a symbol of overwhelming urgency and the abject political failure of Congress to pass new gun laws in the wake of the Newtown , Connecticut , shooting .\nObama , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all called last week for a renewal of the federal assault weapon ban , arguing again that \u201c weapons of war \u201d did not belong on America \u2019 s streets . The military-style rifle the Orlando shooter used was just like \u201c the assault weapon used to kill those little children in Sandy Hook \u201d , Clinton said . By Tuesday last week the online petition to ban assault weapons had 400,000 signatures .\nBut Hockley and Sandy Hook Promise , an advocacy group that she and other family members of victims helped to found , have not joined these calls . \u201c We don \u2019 t advocate for an assault weapon ban , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nPersonally , Hockley does not believe that civilians should own military-style rifles , or that gun companies should market them widely . She and her husband are part of a long-shot lawsuit arguing that gun companies have been \u201c negligent \u201d to sell AR-15s to the general public .\nPolitically , she believes , focusing on an assault weapon ban is the wrong battle \u2013 both in terms of convincing everyday gun owners to support reform and in terms of the number of lives a ban might save .\nOther gun control groups take a similar position . But it \u2019 s a distinction that few Democratic politicians are making \u2013 at least not explicitly .\nWhat journalists call the gun debate is not actually a debate : it \u2019 s an endless pageant of dubious statistics , performed before adjudicators who have already decided how to vote . Gun control Democrats argue that every gun control law is worth fighting for , as long as it could save even a single life . Republicans respond that no gun law will make any difference .\nBoth of those positions dodge the real work of addressing America \u2019 s gun violence problem \u2013 the slow , painstaking evaluation needed to decide which policies might help a little more or a little less , and how much each of them burdens gun owners .\nThat \u2019 s the work Hockley has been doing for more than three years . The first weeks after her son \u2019 s death , still shocked and grieving , Hockley and some of the other parents of children murdered at Sandy Hook began a \u201c crash course \u201d in the history of American gun laws and gun politics .\nThey learned that while assault weapons played a prominent part in many mass shootings , they play only a tiny role in America \u2019 s overall gun violence problem . The loophole-ridden 1994 federal assault weapons ban , which expired in 2004 , produced no clear evidence of reducing gun violence . An in-depth evaluation of the law concluded that the impact of even a more comprehensive ban would be \u201c small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement \u201d .\nThat was not a surprise to anyone who had been paying attention . In the early 1990s , even some gun control advocates criticized the push for an assault weapon ban as a \u201c distraction \u201d with little crime-fighting benefit . But the ban generated intense , visceral reactions from the public . A former Democratic staffer who helped craft the assault weapon ban said he had hoped passing it would give Democrats the political momentum they needed to pass the drier , more technical gun laws that might actually save more lives .\nInstead , the push for a political victory backfired . President Bill Clinton later blamed the assault weapon ban for the 1994 midterm victories that allowed Republicans to take over both houses of Congress . Many prominent gun control groups have since moved away from an assault ban \u2013 \u201c through hard , bitter experience \u201d , said Matt Bennett , a gun policy expert who advised Sandy Hook Promise .\nDemocrats know the research behind the ban . While a ban on high-capacity magazines could help some , the assault weapons ban \u201c does nothing \u201d , a former senior Obama administration official said last year .\nDespite this , the ban has remained a moral litmus test for Democratic politicians .\nObama endorsed the assault weapon ban after Sandy Hook . Behind the scenes , the ban got little political support from the White House in 2013 . Instead , the administration focused its energy on expanding background checks . When it came to the assault weapon ban , \u201c We did the bare minimum , \u201d the official said . \u201c We would have pushed a lot harder if we had believed in it . \u201d\nDespite the Democratic rhetoric around assault weapons last week after 49 people died at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando , the Senate will actually be voting Monday on measures to expand background checks and bar suspected terrorists for buying guns .\nThe horror of mass shootings , and the emotion around them , may make it difficult for politicians to talk bluntly about tradeoffs of banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines .\nThat \u2019 s what \u2019 s so striking about the political decisions that Hockley has made . In talking about the AR-15 at a lawsuit press conference , Hockley spoke precisely , but her face was pale with rage and grief . Other parents wept . This has not stopped them from evaluating the data , and from thinking deeply about what political reforms will most benefit the country as a whole .\nIn the months immediately after her son \u2019 s death , Hockley and other Sandy Hook parents joined the fight to expand the federal background check law \u2013 a measure that would not have saved their children , but that Democratic strategists thought had the best political chances and might do the most good . In April 2013 , key senators voted against the background check measure . Hockley called it a \u201c soul-crushing \u201d experience . She had visited senator after senator to share Dylan \u2019 s story and his photograph . Some of the senators wept at her story , she said , and then later voted against her .\nAfterwards , she and other Sandy Hook Promise members worked for months to develop their own gun violence prevention platform . They support a long list of strategies , from mental health reform to school-based intervention programs to laws creating \u201c gun violence restraining orders \u201d . The assault weapon ban does not make the list . But the group does endorse one part of the 1994 ban : limiting ammunition magazines to ten rounds or less .\nFor Hockley , magazine capacity is an intensely personal issue . \u201c Our shooter brought in 30-round magazines , and shot 154 bullets in less than four minutes , and 11 children from Dylan \u2019 s class , from my son \u2019 s class , managed to hide and escape while he was reloading , \u201d she said . \u201c If he \u2019 d had to reload more often , more kids might have gotten out . \u201d\nBut Sandy Hook Promise has made ammunition limits a second-tier priority , not one of their main advocacy fights . That was a wrenching decision , Hockley said , but , she believes , the right one .\nDuring the debates over the group \u2019 s policy priorities , \u201c I \u2019 ve lost my cool on more than one occasion , \u201d she said . \u201c You have to think about the bigger picture . \u201d\n\u201c If we have limited resources , we are going to fight for bills that would make a bigger difference . \u201d",
