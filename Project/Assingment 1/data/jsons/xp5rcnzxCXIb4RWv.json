    "content": "Russian criminals have stolen 1.2 billion Internet user names and passwords , amassing what could be the largest collection of stolen digital credentials in history , a respected security firm said Tuesday .\nThere 's no need to panic at this point -- Hold Security , the firm that discovered the theft , says the gang is n't in the business of stealing your bank account information . Instead , they make their money by sending out spam for bogus products like weight-loss pills .\nThe Milwaukee-based firm , did n't reveal the identities of the targeted websites , citing nondisclosure agreements and a desire to prevent existing vulnerabilities from being more widely exploited .\nHold Security founder Alex Holden told CNNMoney that the trove includes credentials gathered from over 420,000 websites -- both smaller sites as well as `` household names . '' The criminals did n't breach any major email providers , he said .\nA credential pair consists of a user name -- often an email address -- plus a password . There are roughly half a billion email addresses in the gang 's collection , Hold Security says .\nHolden said the gang makes its money by hacking into email and social accounts , posing as trusted friends and family and advertising bogus products . That means that if you see strange messages being sent from your email or social media accounts , you might be among those affected .\n`` It 's really not that impactful to the individuals , and that 's why they were under the radar for so long , '' Holden said . `` They 've ignored financial information almost completely .
