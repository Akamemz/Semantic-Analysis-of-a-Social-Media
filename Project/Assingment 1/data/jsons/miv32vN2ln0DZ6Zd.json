Apparently , the hep new jive among your tiresome cohort is \u201c Democratic Socialism , \u201d resurrecting a poisonous nineteenth-century political death cult and putting a kicky new spin on it to make it palatable for the suckers . It \u2019 s the political equivalent of hipsters who insist vinyl records are superior because they didn \u2019 t grow up forced to crank their tunes on that miserable format .\nThe \u201c Democratic \u201d part is some cunning rebranding . Just stick \u201c Democratic \u201d in front of something awful and it \u2019 s good-to-go . \u201c Democratic haggis \u201d ? Yummy ! \u201c Democratic herpes \u201d ? Sexy ! \u201c Democratic Nazism ? \u201d Hey , what \u2019 s the difference ? National socialism , democratic socialism ? It \u2019 s really just a question of who runs the camps because regardless of the particular brand of socialism , there are always camps .\nThat these millennial Marxoids lack personal experience with socialism does not stop them from embracing it . After all , socialism \u2019 s biggest fans are always the people who aren \u2019 t trapped inside it . Remember the progs who always fly down to Havana and/or Caracas to party with the local caudillo ? They always fly home again .\nToday 's millennial socialist dilettantes might consider consulting with some of us who have personal experience with this ideological cancer , but millennials tend to prefer to rely upon their arbitrary feelz rather than on boring old facts , evidence , and history .\nWhat the boring old facts , evidence , and history demonstrate , beyond any rational dispute , is that socialism is a bloodstained abomination with north of 100 million corpses to its accursed credit . The It Girl of the current commie/Democrat daisy chain , wide-eyed half-wit Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez , doesn \u2019 t let bourgeois concepts like \u201c knowing things \u201d stop her from sharing her sophomore-grade insights all over the left-wing media , which is to say \u201c the media. \u201d Gulag Barbie is a clown , and even the late nite hack hosts stare back at her adolescent babbling , amazed as she tosses an incoherent word salad about her workers \u2019 paradise .\nWhy , it will be just like Switzerland .

My wife escaped it , though her granddad didn \u2019 t \u2013 he rotted in Castro \u2019 s prisons for nearly two decades because he refused to play ball with the reds . Then he died . Oh well , got ta break a few eggs to create a paradise where somebody else pays for your college , right ?\nThe free stuff thing is a really big part of what today \u2019 s \u201c Democratic Socialism \u201d is \u2013getting the leftist government to send people with guns to take the stuff you \u2019 ve worked for and give it to the people who like socialism .\nFree college ? Well , free for the people who vote for the democratic socialists .\nFree healthcare ? Well , free for the people who vote for the democratic socialists .\nFree whatever they decide they want for free next ? Well , free for\u2026you get the idea .\nThree guesses as to who gets stuck with the check for all this free stuff , because someone always gets stuck with the check because there is no such thing as free stuff . All those millennial mommies who read their theybies that insufferably stupid kiddie book The Giving Tree implanted the dual notions of entitlement and economic illiteracy into their useless spawn . The promise of socialism is that someone else will do the toiling \u2013 and that someone is always the people who reject socialism .\nYou guessed right !
