It 's not just the usual Democrats who are criticizing the administration -- some prominent Republicans , including first lady Melania Trump and former first lady Laura Bush , religious leaders and influential figures in Trump 's conservative evangelical base are also speaking out .\n`` It 's an atrocious policy , '' former White House communications director and Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci said on CNN 's `` New Day '' Monday . `` It 's inhumane .
