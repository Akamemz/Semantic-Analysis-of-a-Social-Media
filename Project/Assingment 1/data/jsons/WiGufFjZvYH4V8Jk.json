    "content": "I would like for President Trump to name Judge Antonin Scalia to the United States Supreme Court . Alas , we get only one Justice Scalia in the course of a nation \u2019 s history . So we accept reality , and we move on . ( Just not dot-org . )\nIt is by now a meme : Democrats always get the exact liberal-for-life Supreme Court justice they want their Presidents to appoint . And Republicans get snookered into aiming for fifty percent , toggling like a wall-light switch between and among ( i ) great conservative justices of historical dimensions like Justices Rehnquist , Scalia , Thomas , and Alito ; ( ii ) serviceable conservative justices like Chief Justices Burger and Roberts ; ( iii ) not-sure-what-kind-of-conservatives-they-are jurists like Justices O \u2019 Connor , Kennedy , and Powell ; and ( iv ) liberals like David Souter and auto-immune-disease conservatives like John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun , whose internally confused ideologies promoted intellectual antibodies that somehow fight their internal conservatism leaving them broken down with liberal results . Thus , Republicans usually settle for mediocrity in ideological conservatism or get sucker-punched with a liberal-for-life David Souter . Color us : Cheated .\nGo back half a century . Nixon quickly threw in the towel after the Titanic-quality disasters of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell . Underscoring the Carswell debacle , United States Senator Roman Hruska fearlessly and passionately defended Carswell who had been derided as a judicial mediocrity : \u201c Even if he is mediocre , there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers . They are entitled to a little representation , aren \u2019 t they , and a little chance ? \u201d It took one to know one , it would seem . In the end , Nixon \u2019 s the One who gave us two solid conservatives of significant mettle , Warren Burger and William Rehnquist , and two others , Harry Blackmun and Lewis Powell . Gerald Ford gave us John Paul Stevens . Ronald Reagan gave us Sandra Day O \u2019 Connor and Anthony Kennedy along with Justice Scalia , not a bad tally , but \u201c good enough \u201d is never good enough \u2014 and \u201c not bad \u201d is bad \u2014 when dealing with the United States Supreme Court . Bush I gave us Clarence Thomas and David Souter \u2014 again , wasting an opportunity with historical ramifications . Bush II gave us the wonderful Samuel Alito , the idiosyncratic but usually conservative John Roberts \u2014 and almost saddled us with Harriet Miers , whatever that was about .\nIt is only with President Donald Trump that Republican conservatives finally are finding a President who has it figured out and who has surrounded himself with an all-star team of experts to help him avoid the Nixon-Reagan-Ford-Bush2 stumbles . NeverTrump Republicans apparently can not discern how good these Trump nominations are . It is Trump Derangement Syndrome ( TDS ) , an ebolic derivative of the earlier Bush Derangement Syndrome that Dr. Krauthammer initially diagnosed years earlier . But for the normative mainstream Republican conservatives who actually elected the Republican President , the Kavanaugh nomination reflects yet another Trump Promise Fulfilled .\nJuly 2018 is not the season for a Scalia appointment . By contrast , it is precisely the season for a Brett Kavanaugh appointment . Not only do Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s writings reflect a solidly conservative approach to jurisprudence , though less overtly partisan and combative than was Justice Scalia \u2019 s style , but he is the right person for the right moment . Republicans nurse a razor-thin 51-49 majority in the United States Senate . The GOP threw away its seat in Alabama . It seems that Senator McCain will not give up his seat so that the Republican governor of Arizona may replace him , and yet Sen. McCain also may not be on hand to vote . That makes it 50-49 . Rand Paul is idiosyncratic . Lisa Murkowski of conservative Republican Alaska needs to be satisfied that the nominee is not driven secretly to overturn Roe v. Wade . Susan Collins has that same concern , and she also has an electorate who live in Maine . Yet conservatives insist on a justice who will not countenance abortion on demand , will protect Second Amendment rights , will not let the federal government shove regulations down the throats of industry without considering the full gamut of financial and social costs , and will protect religious liberties and freedoms . Meanwhile , Democrats swore to oppose the nominee before the embryo even was fertilized .\nThis constellation of factors makes Judge Kavanaugh seem the perfect choice for the moment . Yes , hesitation must be expected when anyone Republican-ish has spent too much time too engaged with the Bushes . There always is the fear of a latent NeverTrump/David Souter-type viral infection having taken hold within \u2014 the \u201c Invasion of the Body Snatchers \u201d -type derangement syndrome that has infected everyone from George Will to Jennifer Rubin ( if she ever really was a conservative ) to that nut Ana Navarro at CNN ( same as Rubin , only even crazier , the one who now wants to hound Sarah Sanders out of restaurants ) . But not everyone associated with Bush was RINO . Dick Cheney wasn \u2019 t RINO . Justice Alito was not RINO . Attorneys-General John Ashcroft and Michael Mukasey were not RINO . United Nations Ambassador John Bolton was not RINO . Thus , for honest conservatives , too , Bush was the address in D.C. if a conservative wanted to try having an impact . Therefore , association with Bush should not be disqualifying per se .\nJudge Kavanaugh \u2019 s judicial opinions are good to read ; they are solid and smart . And there are 300 of them . Unlike David Souter , it is too late in the day for Judge Kavanaugh to hide his views . And his opinions reflect that he supports religious rights and liberties , even to the degree of opposing Obamacare impositions on religious groups that required them to submit paperwork to have their insurers pay for employees \u2019 birth control instead of their paying . On abortion , he rejected the Left \u2019 s race to find a new Constitutional right for under-age unlawful immigrants to have an immediate abortion . He seems steadfastly pro-Second Amendment . And he would not kowtow to an Obama-era EPA regulation where the EPA failed to go through an administrative finding that would balance the economic cost of the new regulation .\nWhat makes this pick so perfect is that the numbers do allow the GOP to win this fight , but it is a nail-biter , no slam dunk . We can not afford to lose Rand Paul or Bob Corker or Jeff Flake , so the nominee has to be such a good human being at his very core that Republican Trump-haters would feel ashamed of themselves for superimposing their anti-Trump animus against such a good soul . It has to be someone with a pristine record , unblemished in jurisprudence and in personal life , so clean that CNN gets stuck with having to re-focus on the missing Malaysian airliner and doing specials on Anthony Bourdain . Also someone who unequivocally has not been disdainful of stare decisis ( the principle that established law , even when decided under suspect situations , can not be overturned perfunctorily to accommodate a new zeitgeist ) . In fact , he co-authored with Justice Gorsuch and others The Law of Judicial Precedent , a treatise defending the principle of stare decisis . How genius of President Trump and his advisers is that ? Thus , to keep Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski on board , Brett Kavanaugh is probably as far to the right as Trump can go .\nJudge Kavanaugh probably will hold their support because he really seems an Altar Boy to this day \u2014 feeding the homeless , tutoring kids in the inner cities , Daddy to two sweet little girls . He coaches kids \u2019 basketball . He brings his kids to watch women \u2019 s basketball . As the meme goes : He is \u201c straight out of central casting. \u201d Yale undergrad , Yale Law School , professor at Harvard Law School , hired for Harvard \u2019 s faculty by Elena Kagan . How genius of President Trump and his advisers is that ? He clerked for two federal appellate court judges and then for Supreme Court Justice Kennedy . Was Associate Independent Counsel with Ken Starr \u2019 s investigation and authored part of the Starr Report . Did a few years \u2019 private law practice as a partner at Kirkland and Ellis , one of the nation \u2019 s top fifty law firms , so he knows what real law practice entails outside the classroom and judge \u2019 s chambers . He sits on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals , often described as the nation \u2019 s most important appellate circuit , the step closest to the United States Supreme Court . It was from that exact spot that three current Supreme Court justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , and Chief Justice Roberts \u2014 each ascended to SCOTUS . Indeed , sitting as a judge on that D.C . Circuit was the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 line that Democrats touted when Obama named Judge Merrick Garland . Not only have many of Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s majority opinions been upheld on appeals by the Supreme Court , but the Court even has adopted some of his dissents on appeal , deeming them the better law than the majority opinions he countered . His 100 most-cited legal opinions have been cited by 210 other judges in their opinions . Thirty-nine of his own 48 judicial appellate clerks have gone on to clerk for United States Supreme Court justices ; that means that justices across the ideological spectrum have deemed Judge Kavanaugh \u2019 s clerks especially well trained and suited for the highest of judicial work .\nFor those of us who want even more , the hope is that , if the GOP expands its hold in the United States Senate after November , then President Trump \u2019 s next Supreme Court Justice can be even more overtly Scalia-ish , and then let those games begin .

These are six Democrats up for reelection in tough races in states that went for Trump in 2016 \u2014 especially the first five , while Nelson has a particularly tough opponent in popular Florida Governor Rick Scott . All these six share a common personality trait that has helped them into the Senate : the ability to lie brazenly \u2014 outright brazen , red-faced lying \u2014 to the voters of their Republican states during the two months before elections , promising faithfully to reflect their constituents \u2019 conservative orientations and preferences\u2026 and then bullet-voting with the Democrats for the next five years and ten months .\nThis time , these six really are stuck . If they show their true colors \u2014 Resistance Democrat \u2014 and vote against Kavanaugh only six weeks before the November election , yet with ample time for their Republican opponents to run six weeks of ads highlighting their perfidy , that may well seal their doom and impel eternally gullible Republican voters to see through the lies and throw them out . On the other hand , if they vote for Kavanaugh , they will inflame their Democrat bases that supply the necessary core votes for reelection . Furious Democrats will stay home or vote a \u201c Green \u201d third party candidate \u2014 and might even hound them out of restaurants \u2014 and that also can help swing the seats to the GOP .\nJustice Kennedy often disappointed , often very deeply .
