    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency just took a dramatic step toward deregulating some major sources of toxic air pollution , which could have huge implications for public health .\nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act , the EPA is required to regulate facilities that emit one or more of 189 hazardous air toxics like benzene , dioxin , and lead that cause health problems such as cancer and birth defects .\nA facility like a chemical plant or a factory is classified as \u201c major \u201d by the Clear Air Act if it has the potential to emit more than 10 tons of an individual toxic chemical or 25 tons of a combination of toxics into the air per year . Those that cross this line have to deploy the \u201c maximum achievable control technology \u201d ( MACT ) to reduce pollution as much as possible with the best hardware that \u2019 s available .\nPollution sources that are regulated under this major sources standard are subject to these regulations indefinitely . But the new EPA guidance , detailed in a memo published Thursday , ends the \u201c once in , always in \u201d policy based on a \u201c plain language reading \u201d of the Clean Air Act . That means that once a pollution source brought its air emissions below the threshold for a major source , it would be held to the standard for an \u201c area source , \u201d or anything that isn \u2019 t a \u201c major source , \u201d instead .\nIn other words , once a \u201c major source \u201d reduces its pollution below the line , it doesn \u2019 t have to keep using the best equipment to continue reducing pollution . Crucially , this rating downgrade means that air pollution from some of these facilities would suddenly be completely unregulated .\nThe EPA did not respond to a request for comment at the time of filing .\n\u201c The possibility seems very likely that some [ downgraded ] sources could actually increase their emissions as long as they don \u2019 t hit the cap , \u201d said Janice Nolen , assistant vice president for national policy at the American Lung Association , who added that changing these rules would remove an important tool for the public to enforce air quality laws .\nOn Twitter , Sen.
