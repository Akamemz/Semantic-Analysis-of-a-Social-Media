It \u2019 s the most women who \u2019 ve ever run for a major-party nomination in history .\nUntil this cycle , there had been , at most , two women who had ever competed in a major party primary , according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics .

Tulsi Gabbard and Oprah \u2019 s spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson , have all announced presidential runs .\nPolitical science tells us that the surge of women this cycle is in large part due to the inroads Hillary Clinton made in 2016 , along with the outrage women across the country have experienced since Donald Trump , an alleged sexual harasser , has taken office . The historic 2018 midterms , which saw the election of more than 100 women Congress members , also demonstrated that women could , overwhelmingly , win .\n\u201c Did Hillary inspire many women to run ? Absolutely , \u201d says political strategist Maria Cardona , though she adds that the visceral response to Trump \u2019 s presidency is likely an even more powerful motivating factor . \u201c I think the anger and fear of what we \u2019 re becoming after Trump really lit a fire in women \u2019 s bellies . \u201d\nBut there could be another explanation \u2014 one that many women running for office themselves have cited : If Donald Trump can be president , why can \u2019 t I run for office ? Whether it \u2019 s a Clinton effect or a Trump effect is a matter of debate , but it has opened the floodgates for women , especially Democratic women , around the country .\nWhat it takes to get women to run for office\nA record number of women ran \u2014 and won \u2014 in the 2018 midterms , and the same dynamics that led to this boost could be contributing to the increase in women presidential candidates as well .\nClinton , the first woman to secure a major-party nomination for the presidency , carved out a path that other women could follow .
