But another key place to look is on farms , where the vast majority of medically important antibiotics are sold .\nAntibiotics on farms are typically used in three ways : to treat sick animals , to prevent infections , and to fatten up animals . The first use is uncontroversial : Everyone agrees that it 's okay to use antibiotics to treat animals that come down with disease . But public health experts have criticized the latter two uses .

That means it 'll be more difficult for farmers to buy these drugs over the counter \u2014 which is where they get most of their drugs right now . So this provision is meant to add some oversight .\nThe law also bans livestock producers from using antibiotics to promote growth or for ambiguous `` prevention '' purposes . The idea is that veterinarians would only write prescriptions for antibiotics if they were used specifically to treat sick animals or prevent a disease where there 's a clear risk .

The more we use antibiotics to kill off disease-causing bacteria, the more likely those bacteria are to evolve resistance, developing random mutations to outwit our drugs. And overuse has become a huge problem. In the United States alone, antibiotic-resistant infections are now associated with 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses every year.
