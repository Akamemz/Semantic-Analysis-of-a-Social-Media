Members were told last week they would receive 48 hours ' notice if they needed to return after Christmas .\nThe principal dispute continues to be over taxes , specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets .\nObama campaigned for re-election on keeping the current lower tax rates on family income up to $ 250,000 , which he argues would protect 98 % of Americans and 97 % of small businesses from rates that increase on income above that level .\nRepublicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates , and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise -- a $ 1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate .\nRep.

The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass , but the Senate first must act .

Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader in the Senate , had an approval rating of 34 % for his role so far .\nReid is poised to assume a larger role as the focus of negotiations appears to be shifting to the Senate after last week 's GOP disarray in the House stymied any progress before Christmas .\nA senior Senate Democratic source told CNN on Wednesday that Reid has made clear in private conversations that he will need assurance any plan can pass both the Senate and the House before he will bring it up .\n`` It is to nobody 's advantage to have a failed Senate vote at this point , '' the source said on condition of not being identified . `` This will be the last train we will have , and there is no sense in it leaving the station before we have assurance it will get through . ''\nRemaining questions include whether enough Republicans will support a compromise acceptable to Democrats , and whether Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell will allow a simple majority vote to take up and pass any proposal , or stick to the filibuster level of 60 % .\n`` We believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both houses , '' a senior White House official said . `` The only thing that would prevent it is if Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner do n't cooperate . ''\nSome Senate Democrats have discussed holding off on bringing up a proposal until the final days of 2012 to increase pressure on Republicans to support avoiding higher taxes on everyone due to the fiscal cliff\nWhile the focus now is on a possible agreement in coming days or weeks , anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN earlier this week that the nation should gird for long-range battle .\n`` It 's four years of a fight .

''\nHowever , Norquist called the situation part of a longer process , predicting `` a regular fight '' when Congress needs to authorize more government spending and raise the federal debt ceiling in coming months .\n`` There the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we 'll let you run the government for the next month , but you 've got to make these reforms , '' he explained .\nOn Wednesday , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner informed Congress that the government would reach its borrowing limit at the end of the year -- in five days ' time -- but could take steps to create what he called `` headroom '' for two months or so .\nHowever , Geithner said uncertainty over the fiscal cliff negotiations and possible changes to the deficit situation made it difficult to predict precisely how long the government 's steps to ease the situation would last .\nBefore heading to Hawaii last Friday , Obama called for Congress to come back after Christmas and work with him on a limited agreement to prevent tax hikes on the middle class , extend unemployment insurance and set a framework for future deficit reduction steps .\nBoehner 's spokesman said the speaker will be `` ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress '' when he returns to Washington , expected to occur on Thursday .\nThe GOP opposition to any kind of tax rate increase has stalled deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama , such as McConnell recently filibustering a proposal he introduced and Thursday night 's rebuff by House Republicans of the alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner , their leader .\nReid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that agreement will require support from legislators in both parties , rather than a GOP majority in the House pushing through a measure on its own .\nHe insisted that a Senate-passed plan with Obama 's $ 250,000 threshold would pass the House if Boehner would allow a vote . However , the Senate proposal is held up on constitutional grounds , because legislation that increases revenue must originate in the House .\nBoehner and Republicans complain the Senate has refused to take up any proposals they have passed in the past two years . Reid argues that the GOP measures amount to a conservative wish list of unacceptable spending cuts and reforms intended to shrink government and weaken entitlement programs vital to senior citizens , the poor and the disabled .\nSome House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president 's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek .\nThe possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt .\nNow , legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction , such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid .\nThe two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $ 2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner .\nObama 's latest offer set $ 400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase , up from his original plan of $ 250,000 . It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits , much to the chagrin of liberals .\nCalled chained CPI , the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years .\nStatistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $ 6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI .\nLiberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained CPI after news emerged this week that Obama was willing to include it , calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits .\nFor his part , Boehner conceded on increased tax revenue , including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating some deductions and loopholes .",
