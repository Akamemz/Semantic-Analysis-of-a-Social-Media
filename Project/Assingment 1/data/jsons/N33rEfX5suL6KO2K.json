What pretzel of Joe McCarthy spin is this , Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook , given Hillary \u2019 s negligent disregard for laws protecting classified national security information\u2014a fact supported by FBI investigation ?\nIn a moment we \u2019 ll address the calculated pretzel and examine those who baked it and those who continue to distribute the twisted product via Media Privilege .\nBut first , The Donald \u2019 s behavior : Candidate Trump \u2019 s tangle with Mr. and Mrs. Khan deserves rebuke . The Khans \u2019 son , U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan , died in combat in Iraq in 2004 . The Khans are a Gold Star family and Trump owes them an apology . I endorse what Sen. Tom Cotton , a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan , said on Hugh Hewitt \u2019 s radio program , \u201c that every American speak to Gold Star families tenderly and with respect and even love. \u201d I served in Iraq in 2004 . Cotton gently speaks the truth .\nYet\u2014mainstream media continue to ignore Hillary Clinton \u2019 s Benghazi lie to Patricia Smith , who , in something of a political mirror to Khan , spoke at the Republican National Convention .\n\u201c I blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son , \u201d Smith said . A moment later she addressed Hillary \u2019 s lie : \u201c In an email to her daughter ( Chelsea ) shortly after the attack , Hillary Clinton blamed it on terrorism . But when I saw Hillary Clinton at Sean \u2019 s coffin ceremony , just days later , she looked me squarely in the eye and told me a video was responsible . Since then , I have repeatedly asked Hillary Clinton to explain to me the real reason why my son is dead . I \u2019 m still waiting . \u201d\nCruel ? Stupid ? Deserving rebuke ? Yes . Clinton \u2019 s behavior reflects what criminal prosecutors call a fact pattern . The parents of other Benghazi victims have also accused Clinton of blatant lying . Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were both former U.S. Navy Seals . They resisted the terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate . They were security guards , they weren \u2019 t on active duty but they died in combat , just like Captain Khan . Yes , combat . They died fighting terrorists . Outmanned , outgunned , at great odds\u2014and calling for reinforcements .\nYet Hillary \u2019 s hideous falsehoods , boldfaced lies to grieving parents , go unrequited . Instead of ferocious outrage , mainstream media treat Hillary \u2019 s vicious misconduct with intense disinterest . Trump \u2019 s response to the Khans was stupid and rude , but Hillary went beyond stupid and rude and accused Smith of lying .\nCan an astonished American jaw drop , pass through the Hell of Earth \u2019 s molten core , and express righteous indignation in China ?\nMuch too frequently , to the point of injuring his presidential prospects , Trump \u201c talks awful , \u201d demonstrating an inability to differentiate between inexcusable rudeness and the New York street moxie that marks his business persona . For this rhetorical misconduct he is fairly chastised .\nHillary , however , actually \u201c does awful. \u201d She commits a dreadful ( and at times criminal ) action with calculation and an unrestrained presumption of privilege . Her dreadful action is provable , having witnesses ( grieving parents ) , or , in the case of her national security information crime , a feckless Jim Comey discovering evidence verifying her gross negligence .\nCredit Chris Wallace with confronting her\u2014but Hillary \u2019 s reptilian being scarcely blinks . She apparently believes that by October mis- and mal-informed voters will believe Comey exonerated her . Hillary believes Americans are stupid .\nWhich takes us back to the phrase \u201c an unrestrained presumption of privilege. \u201d After her awful deeds , so-called objective media\u2014self-proclaimed media of record , by golly by damn\u2014try their best to ignore her wrongs , or , that tactic failing , attempt to justify them .\nIn comparison , Trump faces the Khan tsunami\u2014a genuine restraint . It is guaranteed he will face more tsunamis , throughout this election and , should he win , throughout his presidency .\nBut\u2014will Hillary \u2019 s despicable , inexcusable , self-serving , mendacious and outright cruel treatment of grieving parents who lost sons in a battle with terrorists generate a similarly restraining media tsunami of equivalent intensity and outrage ?\nBased on the fact pattern : No . At best we \u2019 ll get a drip drip drip of sighs followed by a \u201c move on , little to see here\u2026 \u201d\nMedia Privilege . Disgusting isn \u2019 t it ? You bet . Crooked ? Media Privilege permits Crooked Hillary \u2019 s survival , so , yeah , it \u2019 s crooked . Harmful poison if swallowed by the American body politic ? Damned straight it is . There \u2019 s a national security angle here lost on mainstream media toffs but not on American war fighters . Let \u2019 s frame the question bluntly : \u201c Will major media\u2014so called mainstream media\u2014let a Republican Administration fight and win a war without going Peace Now ? \u201d\nMedia Privilege is a central subject in this election . The stark , evident and biased difference in mainstream media conduct wages war on honesty . A substantial plurality of the American people sensed it thirty years ago , now they know it . Truth be told , they \u2019 re sick of it .\nHow large is this plurality ? I don \u2019 t know . I \u2019 m not sure anyone does . But they may be a majority of likely voters . Their disgust with mainstream media bias and liberal Democrat Media Privilege are , collectively , Trump \u2019 s first election ace . This ace card is why The Donald may well emerge from the Khan tsunami\u2014and emerge swimmingly .\nPowerline \u2019 s John Hinderaker told PBS in 2007 , \u201c Anybody who \u2019 s in politics as a Republican knows that when you \u2019 re talking to a reporter , there \u2019 s probably somewhere between an 85 percent and 95 percent chance that you \u2019 re talking to a Democrat . I think that \u2019 s the basic reality . \u201d\nPowerline.com won accolades for its role in busting Dan Rather \u2019 s big time lie during the 2004 election . Remember ? Rathergate where ole Dan and \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d peddled fabricated documents alleging George W. Bush shirked National Guard duty ? Ole Dan defended his documents as \u201c fake but accurate . \u201d\nOut of such slime claims of objectivity still burble . Hey , in 2014 ole Dan and Robert Redford produced a movie , Truth , which continues to promote his damnable lie . The fake documents were Ole Dan \u2019 s story , not his allegation . But that \u2019 s Media Privilege with a Hollywood Privilege follow-on fraud .\nDonald Trump \u2019 s genius political move was to go head-to-head with the Democrats \u2019 Media Privilege and say To Hell ! with anything the frauds threw at him\u2014absolutely anything they threw , fraud charges or legit critique . Trump bet the mainstream media elites \u2019 legacy of lies would dog them and theirs more than any mistake he might make . Pressure defense , baby , and pressure offense .\nDonald Surber , author of the newly published book Trump The Press , understood Trump from the get-go : \u201c His plan was simple : use the summer ( 2015 ) lull in news to dominate the cable news networks , and make the race a referendum on him. \u201d ( p.48 )\nAccording to Surber , Trump made several astute assessments based on inside experience with electronic media . Here \u2019 s Surber , at length :\n\u201c Trump copied the marketing plan that Aaron Spelling and Fox broadcasting used to make Beverly Hills 90210 a hit series . The series fin\u00adished in eighty-eighth place after its first season . But that summer , when the other networks showed reruns , Fox offered fresh episodes of 90210 , which drew viewers and developed a following . The show moved up to forty-eighth place in its second season . Providing fresh material to the cable news networks in the summer boosted Trump \u2019 s ratings as well . He knew television better than its talk\u00ading heads did . \u201d\nNow for Media Privilege . Trump also \u201c knew his audience hated the press as much as it hated Congress and both political parties . His criticisms of the press endeared him to the public . Battling the press made him a fighter , which was part of his attraction to the ignored rank-and-file Republicans : he fights . \u201d\nDirect quote of Abraham Lincoln praising Ulysses S. Grant . Honest Abe backed Grant when media\u2014especially Copperhead Democrat media in Union territory\u2014portrayed Grant as a drunkard , a dummy , a failure .\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Copperhead \u201c Peace \u201d Democrats who opposed fighting and winning the Civil War , here \u2019 s a War On Honesty historical bonus .\nVerily . Peace Democrat , man . Peace Now . Stop Abe In 1864 , man . And continued slavery ? Beside the point , man . Because Peace Now , man . And vote Democrat .\nIndeed , the ugly Civil War legacy of anti-war Democrats . Now you know .\nBack to 2016 : Surber observed that Trump \u2019 s media strategy \u201c was a high-risk strategy that worked because it separated him from the politicians. \u201d Surber credits several pundits\u2014Mark Steyn and Pat Buchanan in particular\u2014with recognizing that Trump challenged opponents and media who would seize on any gaffe . Hark , another Civil War echo . Damn the gaffes , full speed ahead !\nI asked Surber to evaluate the last 10 days of the 2016 presidential campaign . \u201c Remember , he \u2019 s a rookie candidate , \u201d Surber replied by email . \u201c Trump will stick to his game plan and amend it as the campaign proceeds . \u201d\nHe added , Trump \u201c hijacked her convention . All this BS about the Russians was very entertaining to his supporters , as well as it linked the DNC emails to Hillary \u2019 s State Department fiasco . \u201d\nMore : \u201c Having learned nothing , Democrats will show her ( Hillary ) chirping in ads on news programs following one of his speeches . That \u2019 s what they do . That \u2019 s how they buy the ads . And it will backfire . Again . So what will they do after that ? I have no idea . But so far , Trump is sticking to his game plan while amending it as he learns from the first half . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s he learned ? Based on his August 2 interview with Bill O \u2019 Reilly , he \u2019 s going to double down . Damn the gaffes .\nLet \u2019 s return to the treason innuendo , to get a feel for the vast moral vacuum of Media Privilege Trump challenges .\nAs previously noted , on July 22\u2014in what I suspect honest histories will describe as an act of political desperation\u2014the Dems ( led by Robby Mook ) pivoted to Old Glory-waving display and creepy Joe McCarthyesque charges of treasonous collaboration with the Kremlin .\nAlas , the Democrats are not the party of American defense and the American flag\u2014and the American people know it , despite what the mainstream media may try to sell for the next two weeks .\nHence Trump \u2019 s second ace card in the election\u2014the Democrat kowtow to Blame Amerika leftist antics and disdain for American soldiers , a 21st century echo of Civil War-era Copperhead Democrats . The Dems \u2019 leftish-elitist kowtow is a fact pattern that began in 1968 with Bill Ayers , Pete Seeger Communist-kumbayah , Students for a Democratic Society screaming \u201c Revolution now ! \u201d and street battles with Mayor Dailey \u2019 s Chicago cops .\n1971\u2014John Kerry accusing fellow soldiers of war crimes . 1983\u2014the Euro-missile Crisis , totally manufactured by the Kremlin but the Dems claimed Ronald Reagan is a warmonger . 1985\u2014Dems go gaga over Gorbachev .

In 2007 , as General David Petraeus prepared to brief Congress on the Iraq surge , Dems like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , in collusion with their friends at Media Matters and The New York Times advertising section , warned of General Betray Us .
