He shows a picture of a dead baby. This is Willie Horton stuff,\u201d an exasperated Barrett charged during the one-hour debate at Marquette University. \u201cYou should be ashamed of that commercial Scott Walker.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Walker ad in question shows a blurred picture of a 2-year-old who spent six days in intensive care after being severely beaten. \u201cBut Tom Barrett\u2019s police department didn\u2019t consider it a violent crime,\u201d says a narrator.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Walker ad on Milwaukee crime statistics)\n\nWalker has made crime statistics in Milwaukee a centerpiece of his closing argument against Barrett in the June 5 gubernatorial recall election, seizing on recent news reports that have identified hundreds of misreported violent crimes during the mayor\u2019s tenure.\n\nBut Barrett\u2019s outrage at the scathing spot created the most emotionally charged moment of the evening.\n\n\u201cThat baby died. The person who killed that baby was arrested by Milwaukee police, was prosecuted by Milwaukee \u2026 But you know what they did wrong. After the baby died, they didn\u2019t change the code.
