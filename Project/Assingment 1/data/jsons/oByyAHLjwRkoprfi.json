He has resisted calls to resign.\n\nOn Wednesday, state Attorney General Mark Herring admitted that he too had once worn blackface, for a costume while he was in college. \u201cIn the days ahead, honest conversations and discussions will make it clear whether I can or should continue to serve as attorney general, but no matter where we go from here, I will say that from the bottom of my heart, I am deeply, deeply sorry for the pain that I cause with this revelation,\u201d Herring said in a statement.
