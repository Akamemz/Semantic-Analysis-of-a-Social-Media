Kemp has already declared victory in the race and resigned his secretary of state position to prepare for the transition .\nIn a 56-page ruling , Totenberg also called for the office to provide a hotline or website for provisional ballot voters to find out why or if they were rejected . The judge ordered all 159 of the state 's counties to publicize the availability of the hotlines on their websites .\nThe court decision comes as votes are still being counted in the race for governor between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp .
