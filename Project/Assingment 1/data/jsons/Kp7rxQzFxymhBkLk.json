    "content": "The impeachment of President Trump has dominated the news this week . But the political focus shifted to the Democratic presidential candidates Thursday night for their sixth debate , this one in Los Angeles and hosted by the PBS NewsHour and Politico .\nThe first subject to come up ? Impeachment . But there are no real cleavages between the candidates on that subject . After all , each of the candidates thinks he should n't be in office . That 's why they 're running against him .\nThere was a notable moment when former Vice President Joe Biden defended his continued regard for bipartisanship despite him and his family coming under attack from Republicans in the Ukraine saga .\n`` If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate , it 's me , '' Biden said , adding , `` I have no love . But the fact is , we have to be able to get things done . And when we ca n't convince them , we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states . ''\nBiden was crisper than in most of the other debates , and , unlike those other debates , his steadiness lasted mostly all the way through . He sidestepped a question , about whether he would run for a second term if elected , given his age \u2014 77 . And he was , at times , tougher with his opponents . For example , telling Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to put his hand down while Biden was finishing an answer .\nBiden did n't dominate the debate , and , at times , he faded from view , but that 's something of a win for him . The steadier he is , the fewer of Biden 's supporters \u2014 and potential supporters \u2014 will be wringing their hands .\nIt took awhile for it to happen , but , as expected , South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg faced some pointed attacks . Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts went after him on fundraising ( yes , in a `` wine cave '' ) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on his experience .\n`` The mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $ 900-a-bottle wine , '' Warren said . `` Think about who comes to that . ''\n`` I have not denigrated your experience as a local official , '' Klobuchar said , pointedly contrasting Buttigieg 's municipal job with hers in Congress .\nButtigieg parried the attacks with some skill , especially toward Warren on fundraising . `` I am literally the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire , '' he said , adding , `` This is the problem with issuing purity tests you can not yourself pass . ''\nButtigieg also hit back at Klobuchar , noting that he had won the 2015 South Bend mayor 's race `` with 80 % of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence 's Indiana . ''\nBut Klobuchar got the last word , noting he had lost the 2010 race for Indiana state treasurer `` by 20 points . I 'm sorry . That 's just the math . '' ( It was 25 points . )\nButtigieg has been surging in Iowa and New Hampshire , and both Warren and Klobuchar see him as an obstacle to their candidacies . He leads with college-educated whites , a group Warren is second with , according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll . And for Klobuchar to have a chance at the nomination , she has to do well in Iowa , as she 's from a neighboring state .\n3 . Money remains a key divide \u2014 and potential problem for Democrats\nThe exchange between Warren and Buttigieg on fundraising highlighted an important split in the Democratic Party \u2014 how to raise money .\nBut it also highlighted another reality \u2014 money is important in politics .\nPolling shows Democratic primary voters want to get money out of politics , but running presidential campaigns costs billions of dollars . Literally , billions .\nAnd here 's the reality : President Trump does n't care where the money comes from , and , so far , is raking in far more than any of the Democratic candidates .\n`` It 's not an easy decision , especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections , '' Barack Obama said in 2008 of his decision to forgo public financing . `` But the public financing of presidential elections , as it exists today , is broken and we face opponents who 've become masters of gaming this broken system . ''\nDemocrats will have a lot of catching up to do on the fundraising front once a nominee is named . It 's one reason incumbent presidents have such an advantage .\n4 . Some issues came up that had n't and others got attention in different ways\nClimate change was a focus earlier than in past debates .\nAnd other topics , which have received little-to-no attention , also came up \u2014 everything from trade and China to Muslim Uighurs and Israel and the Palestinian territories .\nIt 's a reminder that there are lots of things a president has to deal with \u2014 and often has more control over \u2014 than many of the topics that dominate presidential campaigns .\nOne topic that came up later than usual ( 10:06 p.m . ET , more than two hours into the debate ) was health care . The candidates have debated health care ad nauseam in prior debates , but Thursday night 's had a new wrinkle \u2013 whether the candidates calling for big change would be in favor of less sweeping measures if Medicare for All failed to pass Congress as a replacement for private health insurance .\nThe question was directed to Sanders , and he would n't say . `` We 're going to have the American people behind us ; we will have the Congress behind us , '' Sanders insisted .\nBiden said he did n't think that was `` realistic . '' And that highlights the real fracture in the Democratic Party primary \u2014 the purists versus the pragmatists .\nKlobuchar chimed in to defend both Biden and herself . `` I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time , '' she said , adding that Sanders ' fight was n't really with her or Biden , but with new House members from moderate districts and with Andy Beshear , the new Democratic governor of conservative Kentucky , who wants to build on Obamacare .\n`` If you want to cross a river over some troubled waters , '' Klobuchar said , `` you build a bridge , you do n't blow one up . ''\nNotably , the other candidate in favor of Medicare for All stayed silent for most of the exchange .
