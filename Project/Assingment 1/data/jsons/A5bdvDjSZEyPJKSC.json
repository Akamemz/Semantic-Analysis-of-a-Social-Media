Solis/AP\n\nAs a new school year gets underway, the Common Core remains a partisan flashpoint, while Americans overall have serious concerns about the direction of our public education system. That's according to two new polls.\n\nEducation Next, a policy journal, released its 10th annual large national poll of public opinion on education today. And Gallup, the polling organization, has recently released new figures as well.\n\nWith results broken out along partisan lines, the polls also provide insight into trends that may affect the current presidential campaign.\n\nHere's a roundup of key findings:\n\nCommon Core: Like the idea, hate the name\n\nEdNext says support for the Common Core State Standards, the K-12 math and English standards initially adopted in 45 states, has plummeted in a relatively short time. In 2012, the first year EdNext asked about them, 90 percent of those who had an opinion favored the standards. This year, the number had sunk to 50 percent.\n\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\n\n\"The decline in Common Core support is largely due to two factors,\" says Lorraine McDonnell, a professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has conducted her own studies of public opinion on Common Core. \"One, respondents' limited knowledge of what it is and who is responsible for it. And, two, its politicization by Tea Party adherents, the testing opt-out movement and some political candidates.\"\n\nA quick search of the hashtag #commoncore on Twitter turns up negative posts from both ends of the political spectrum, including from self-described Trump supporters.\n\nBut there's an interesting wrinkle in these results.\n\nWhen you ask Americans how they feel about \"the use of the same standards across states,\" two-thirds say they approve. That figure has also declined in the past four years, but not as dramatically.\n\nOf course \"the same standards across states\" is basically the definition of Common Core. Republicans seem especially allergic to the Common Core \"brand.\" When the name is mentioned, approval plummets 22 points; the difference is 10 points for Democrats.\n\nMcDonnell observes that for more than 15 years, even before Common Core was introduced, many surveys, like this one, have found support for cross-state or national standards. \"[Those terms] are concrete and understandable to the public and largely untinged by political rhetoric.\"\n\nGrowing red state-blue state divides\n\nPartisan divides on education policy are wide. But they can be unpredictable.\n\nIn the Gallup poll, just 32 percent of Republicans approve of the nation's K-12 education system, while 53 percent of Democrats feel the same. Just two years ago, both were tied at 48 percent approval.

On the other hand, Dems are now more likely than Republicans to favor school vouchers and tuition tax credits for public schools, both traditional GOP proposals.\n\nUp close looks better than far away\n\nAnother result worth highlighting: In the EdNext poll, Americans' opinions of their local public schools have risen considerably over the past decade. More than half \u2014 55 percent \u2014 give the school in their community an \"A\" or \"B\" rating, compared with just 43 percent a decade ago.\n\nIt's hard to find an empirical reason for this warming of opinion.
