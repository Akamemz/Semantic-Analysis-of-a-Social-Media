    "content": "President Obama this week has found himself at odds with allies in Congress and in organized labor over lifting the 40-year ban on U.S. crude oil exports , with the White House still blocking efforts to ship American fuel abroad despite growing support for the idea and mounting evidence that exports will drive down domestic gasoline prices .\nJust this week , two powerful labor unions \u2014 the Laborers \u2019 International Union of North America and the International Union of Operating Engineers \u2014 joined in a letter to congressional leaders urging them to pass legislation lifting the ban , which has stood since the energy crisis years of the 1970s . Bills to remove the prohibition are gaining steam in both houses of Congress , where more and more Democrats are bucking the administration and calling for the U.S. to take full advantage of its abundance of energy .\nAt the same time , a recent Government Accountability Office review found evidence that lifting the ban could reduce domestic gasoline prices by as much as 13 cents a gallon and \u201c would lead to additional investment in crude oil production and increases in employment . \u201d\nFor Mr. Obama , the crude oil debate has once again pitted him against his traditional friends in organized labor . Major labor unions also have criticized the president for refusing to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline , which the administration admits would create more than 40,000 jobs .\nOn oil exports , some unions say the White House is missing a golden opportunity to spur economic growth at a time when fewer and fewer Americans are participating in the workforce .\n\u201c Opening global markets to U.S. producers will support added domestic production that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and contribute tens of billions of GDP dollars in the supply chain within the next few years . At the same time , we will put downward pressure on domestic fuel prices , while we provide our allies and trading partners with an alternative to sourcing energy from unfriendly and unstable sources , \u201d reads the letter to House leaders , signed by labor unions , manufacturing groups and a host of others who support repealing the ban .\nThe letter specifically calls for the passage of House Bill 702 , which would dramatically ease restrictions on exports . The bill has more than 70 co-sponsors , and similar bipartisan legislation also has emerged in the Senate .\nCrafted four decades ago , the ban was meant to conserve all American oil and protect the country from fuel shortages in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo that sought to punish the U.S. for its support of Israel . Today , fears of fuel shortages no longer exist , with the U.S. now entrenched as the world \u2019 s largest producer of both oil and natural gas .\nWhile the administration slowly has opened the door to gas exports , shipping crude oil around the world remains forbidden .\nThe White House confirmed Thursday it has not changed its position on crude oil exports . Officials previously have expressed concern that lifting the ban would lead to higher gas prices at home .\nBut a host of studies , including one from Harvard Business School and the Boston Consulting Group , along with the recent GAO review , say otherwise .\nWith the gas prices question seemingly answered , a growing number of Democrats are joining with Republicans in pushing legislation to overturn the ban .\n\u201c The advantages of lifting the ban on crude oil exports are not just theoretical talking points discussed in the halls of Congress , but rather supported by a large and growing body of research by government agencies , academic institutions and think tanks across the political spectrum , \u201d Rep.
