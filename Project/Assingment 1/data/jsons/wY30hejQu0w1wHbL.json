The report , titled Cyborg Soldiers 205 : Human/ Machine Fusion and the Implications for the Future of the DOD , reads like the framework for a dystopian novel set in a near future where injured soldiers are cybernetically enhanced , but come home to an America terrified of cyborgs .\n\u201c The primary objective of this effort was to determine the potential of machines that are physically integrated within the human body to augment and enhance the performance of human beings over the next 30 years , \u201d the researchers said .\nThe study identified poor public perception as being a barrier to the mass adoption of cybernetics . Terminator II : Judgement Day poisoned us all against killer robots , much to the military \u2019 s chagrin .\n\u201c Across popular social and open-source media , literature , and film , the use of machines to enhance the physical condition of the human species has received a distorted and dystopian narrative in the name of entertainment , \u201d the study said . \u201c Defense leadership should understand that negative public and social perceptions will need to be overcome , if these technologies are to be fielded . \u201d\nCyber enhancement is cutting edge technology , and it \u2019 s hard to predict where it will go over the next three decades . The Pentagon researchers focused on four probable areas of enhancement : super vision , augmented hearing , enhanced muscles , and \u201c direct neural enhancement of the human brain for two-way data transfer . \u201d\nThe Pentagon predicts a world where enhanced soldiers have cybernetically enhanced eyes that allow them to see across the battlefield in different wavelengths , and identify targets in \u201c dense , urban environments or subterranean megacities that will challenge identification and tracking of targets , \u201d they said .\nThe researchers mention what becomes a disturbing theme of the study\u2014many of these enhancements may only occur after a soldier is injured . When working with a delicate area such as the eye , injury may be the only path towards convincing a wounded warrior to receive the surgery , the study notes .\n\u201c Ocular enhancement would be an attractive medical option in situations where the eye tissue has been damaged or destroyed by injury or disease , \u201d the researchers said . \u201c It is deemed unlikely that individuals would willingly undergo removal of healthy tissue in an area considered to be sensitive . However , the central and critical role that vision plays in society would likely motivate warfighters who have lost part or all of their vision to voluntarily undergo surgery that would restore or even improve their ability to see . \u201d\nThis trend of fixing fallen soldiers with cybernetics continues with optogenetic musculoskeletal control systems . \u201c The most likely [ use ] would be in the restoration of lost function due to injury of muscles or nerves , \u201d the study said . \u201c Musculoskeletal injuries are the second leading cause of lost duty time in the U.S. Armed Forces . \u201d\nTo enhance muscles , the Pentagon would enhance weak tissue with a \u201c network of emplaced subcutaneous sensors that deliver optogenetic stimulation through programmed light pulses , \u201d the researchers said . Optogenetics stimulates muscle tissue , or even neurons , with light instead of electricity .\n\u201c The optogenetic controller would , in effect , take control of the motions of a warfighter \u2019 s limbs , thereby allowing a novice ( i.e. , the warfighter ) to perform functions professionally ''\n\u201c The human body would have an array of small optical sensors implanted beneath the skin in the body areas that need to be controlled .

It could also allow them to control external tools such as drones and weapons systems not directly attached to their body .
