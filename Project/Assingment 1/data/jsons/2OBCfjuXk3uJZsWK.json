But Democrats say Republicans have yet to lay out any specific taxes they will raise , nor have they given their own list of spending cuts .\n\u201c Now is the time for the Republicans to move past this happy talk about revenues \u2014 ill-defined , of course \u2014 and put specifics on the table , \u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , said at a news conference , surrounded by his leadership team . \u201c The president has made his proposal . We need a proposal from them . \u201d\nThe White House wish list included billions of dollars more in stimulus spending , a call to curtail Congress \u2019 control over the federal debt limit , a rise in the estate tax and an increase in taxes on dividends . Those last two items specifically would undo parts of President Bush \u2019 s 2001 and 2003 tax plans and are likely to be contentious among some Democrats , as well as with Republicans .\nIn exchange , Mr. Obama repeated his pledge to find up to $ 400 billion in entitlement spending cuts later , as well as to undertake an overhaul of the tax code .\nSpeaking with reporters after hearing the offer from Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said they are no closer to a deal .\n\u201c No substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks , \u201d Mr. Boehner said .\nThe White House has signaled some flexibility . Though Mr. Obama has called for tax rates on upper-income earners to rise from 35 percent to 39.6 percent \u2014 the same rate during the Clinton administration \u2014 he and his aides privately have told key players that they would be willing to accept something less than the 39.6 percent rate .\nStill , they have said that rates will have to rise somewhat .\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Republican leaders must \u201c accept the essential fact \u201d that tax rates on the nation \u2019 s top earners must go up as part of a deficit-reduction deal .\n\u201c The president will not sign any legislation that extends the Bush-era tax cuts for the top earners in this country , \u201d he said .\nCongressional Republicans said that is out of the question . Instead , they want the additional government revenue to come from ending tax breaks and closing loopholes .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve made clear that we \u2019 ve put real concessions on the line by putting revenues on the table right upfront , \u201d said Mr. Boehner . \u201c Unfortunately , many Democrats continue to rule out sensible spending cuts that must be part of any significant agreement that will reduce our deficit . \u201d\nBut Mr. Boehner has not laid out what specific tax breaks he would end , nor have Republicans proposed spending cuts as part of these negotiations . Instead , Mr. Boehner pointed reporters back to the House Republican budget for a list of ideas .\nAll sides are trying to head off the \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d \u2014 the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts on Jan. 1 , followed a day later by $ 110 billion in automatic spending cuts .\nGoing over the cliff and staying there likely would plunge the country into a short , sharp recession , though delaying the spending cuts and tax increases would mean deeper pain in the long run , according to the Congressional Budget Office .\nThe challenge for Mr. Obama and Congress is to try to spread the pain while doing the least harm to the economy .\nMr. Geithner \u2019 s separate meetings with congressional leaders marked the first major get-together between top negotiators since Mr. Obama called the leaders to the White House two weeks ago .\nAt the time , Mr. Boehner ; Mr. Reid ; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat ; and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , met with Mr. Obama at the White House and emerged sounding optimistic about the chances of reaching a deal to extend tax cuts and replace the spending cuts , known as \u201c sequestration , \u201d that were set into motion through last year \u2019 s bipartisan deal to raise the nation \u2019 s borrowing limit .\nMr. McConnell accused the Obama administration of being more interested in appealing to the \u201c hard left \u201d than having a \u201c serious discussion about how we fix the economy , reduce the federal debt and return the country to a path of growth and prosperity for all . \u201d\nMr. Boehner said he is \u201c disappointed \u201d with the negotiations and warned that \u201c there \u2019 s a real danger of going off the fiscal cliff . \u201d\n\u201c Without spending cuts and entitlement reforms , it \u2019 s going to be impossible to address our country \u2019 s debt crises and get our economy going again and to create jobs , \u201d he said . \u201c So right now , all eyes are on the White House . \u201d\nThe two parties also have staked out different positions on how best to increase the nation \u2019 s $ 16.4 trillion debt limit , which the federal government could reach as early as next month .
