    "content": "In America , it is legal in most states for police to take and keep your stuff without ever convicting you for a crime . Now , Attorney General Jeff Sessions apparently wants to let police do this even more often .\nMost states and federal law already allow what \u2019 s called \u201c civil asset forfeiture. \u201d This lets police seize someone \u2019 s property without proving the person was guilty of a crime ; they just need probable cause to believe the assets were used or obtained in some kind of criminal activity , typically drug trafficking .\nPolice can then absorb the value of the property \u2014 be it cash , cars , guns , or something else \u2014 as profit , either through state programs or under a federal program known as equitable sharing , which lets local and state police get up to 80 percent of the value of what they seize as money for their departments . For police departments , this can end up a fairly profitable venture .\nOn Wednesday , Sessions signed an order to encourage law enforcement to use civil asset forfeiture more often , rescinding previous orders by President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration limiting the practice . The order includes some supposed safeguards , which ask law enforcement to be careful , make sure there is sufficient evidence of a crime , and more thoroughly document the evidence and probable cause justification .\n\u201c [ W ] e hope to issue this week a new directive on asset forfeiture \u2014 especially for drug traffickers , \u201d Sessions said on Monday , hinting at the forthcoming order . \u201c With care and professionalism , we plan to develop policies to increase forfeitures .

A recent report from the inspector general at the Justice Department , for example , found that the Drug Enforcement Administration alone seized more than $ 3.2 billion in assets from 2007 to 2016 .\nBut Sessions wants more . The order comes in sharp contrast to the moves of several states \u2014 led by Republicans and Democrats \u2014 and the Obama administration , which attempted to limit the use of civil forfeiture following reports of its frequent abuse by police departments .\nCritics have long argued that civil forfeiture allows law enforcement to essentially police for profit , since many of the proceeds from seizures can go back to police departments .

For example , in New Mexico and North Carolina , a court must convict the suspect of a crime before the same judge or jury can consider whether seized property can be absorbed by the state .
