    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s Independence Day speech at Mount Rushmore was a call to arms to take on the evil mob destroying our beloved country \u2019 s values . It was a thunderous condemnation of the political left , and a promise to seize the country from the \u201c totalitarian \u201d proponents of \u201c social justice \u201d who are destroying our culture of \u201c free and open debate , \u201d replacing it with \u201c cancel culture and speech codes \u201d :\nIn our schools , our newsrooms , even our corporate boardrooms , there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance . If you do not speak its language , perform its rituals , recite its mantras , and follow its commandments , then you will be censored , banished , blacklisted , persecuted , and punished\u2026 One of their political weapons is \u201c Cancel Culture \u201d \u2014 driving people from their jobs , shaming dissenters , and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees . This is the very definition of totalitarianism , and it is completely alien to our culture and our values , and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America . This attack on our liberty , our magnificent liberty , must be stopped , and it will be stopped very quickly . We will expose this dangerous movement , protect our nation \u2019 s children , end this radical assault , and preserve our beloved American way of life .\nTrump \u2019 s picture of what is going on in the country is totally detached from reality . Totalitarianism involves guns and concentration camps . The \u201c radical left \u201d in the United States has two members of Congress , Bernie Sanders and AOC . ( Perhaps Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib . ) This is the same conservative persecution complex we have heard for decades ; some of the richest and most powerful people in the world complaining that the \u201c far left \u201d are totalitarians . The left is permanently tarred as Stalinist thought police trying to put dissenters in the gulag\u2014even as the contemporary left is trying to dismantle both police and prisons and reduce the power of the carceral state .\nIt should be clear what \u2019 s going on here . Trump \u2019 s much-vaunted economy has tanked . Well over 100,000 people have died of coronavirus and cases are on the rise . Eight out of 10 people report that they are dissatisfied with the direction the country is going , and Joe Biden is outpolling Trump consistently . Americans have only gotten more sympathetic to immigrants over time , so he can \u2019 t run on scapegoating Mexicans like he did in 2016 . Trump has one approach left : try to reignite the culture wars and convince people that a censorious P.C . left is trying to destroy our freedom .\nBut Trump is not the only one who sees the left as a threat to freedom . Rolling Stone journalist Matt Taibbi has said that the \u201c American left has lost its mind , \u201d and that \u201c leaders of this new movement are replacing traditional liberal beliefs about tolerance , free inquiry , and even racial harmony with ideas so toxic and unattractive that they eschew debate , moving straight to shaming , threats , and intimidation. \u201d Yesterday , Harper \u2019 s magazine\u2014which previously fired an editor for criticizing an anti-MeToo essay , and gave the world a 7,000 word self-pitying rant from an NPR host dismissed for sexual harassment and incompetence\u2014published a short open letter on \u201c Justice and Open Debate \u201d co-signed by a motley assortment of luminaries , arguing that free speech is under attack :\nThe free exchange of information and ideas , the lifeblood of a liberal society , is daily becoming more constricted . While we have come to expect this on the radical right , censoriousness is also spreading more widely in our culture : an intolerance of opposing views , a vogue for public shaming and ostracism , and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty . We uphold the value of robust and even caustic counter-speech from all quarters . But it is now all too common to hear calls for swift and severe retribution in response to perceived transgressions of speech and thought . More troubling still , institutional leaders , in a spirit of panicked damage control , are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms . Editors are fired for running controversial pieces ; books are withdrawn for alleged inauthenticity ; journalists are barred from writing on certain topics ; professors are investigated for quoting works of literature in class ; a researcher is fired for circulating a peer-reviewed academic study ; and the heads of organizations are ousted for what are sometimes just clumsy mistakes . Whatever the arguments around each particular incident , the result has been to steadily narrow the boundaries of what can be said without the threat of reprisal .\nWhen I say the collection of co-signers was motley , I mean it . Included were :\n( Ironically , several of the signatories have previously been publicly involved in efforts to get people \u2019 s careers ruined over their speech . )\nThe statement itself is framed as a vague and unobjectionable endorsement of free speech , and several signatories had evidently assumed that \u2019 s what they were endorsing . But it is very clearly mainly a warning about censoriousness coming from the left . This is clear not only from the it \u2019 s not just the right anymore framing , but from the examples the letter uses to support its case . These are vague ( \u201c editors are fired , \u201d \u201c journalists are barred from writing , \u201d \u201c professors are investigated for quoting works of literature , \u201d \u201c a researcher is fired \u201d ) , and the letter specifically declines to litigate the facts of individual incidents . But a book attacked for \u201c inauthenticity \u201d is probably American Dirt ( though it was not withdrawn and is a bestseller ) , an editor fired is probably James Bennet , who resigned from the New York Times op-ed page after printing an op-ed by far right politician Tom Cotton calling for crushing protesters with military force . ( Though it could also refer to Ian Buruma , a signatory to the letter , the New York Review of Books editor who had to leave the publication after publishing a serial rapist \u2019 s excuses for his crimes . ) The \u201c professor investigated \u201d might well be the UCLA professor investigated for reading the n-word aloud in \u201c Letter from Birmingham Jail \u201d after his Black students asked him not to say it . The \u201c researcher fired \u201d was almost certainly David Shor , who may or may not ( he has never claimed he was ) have been fired for posting a study encouraging protesters to be nonviolent .\nThe letter appeared on the surface to be a fairly uncontroversial statement in support of tolerance and open discussion . Fredrik deBoer even argues that anyone who objects to the letter must be objecting to free speech itself , because all the letter is is a statement that free speech is good . But the letter actually goes further : It implies that the theory of a widespread culture of repression and censoriousness on the left is accurate , and there is a serious issue with people being persecuted in the name of social justice .\nAnyone should be able to agree that openness is good , due process is good , and arbitrary firings are bad . The more controversial question is whether there is , in fact , a dangerous leftist \u201c cancel culture \u201d that threatens our liberty of thought . The American right believes there is . Trump is staking his reelection on the hope that the public agrees . And if it \u2019 s true , there is a serious problem with the left .\nBut when you look at the actual incidents , usually the case swiftly begins to crumble . There \u2019 s a reason the letter kept the charges vague and did not provide links . Most of the actual incidents are more complicated than the \u201c political correctness gone mad \u201d framework suggests . If I tell you a professor was investigated for reading a historical document aloud , you might be outraged . But if I add some more facts , namely that the professor had been told by his Black students that they \u2019 d prefer he not say the n-word , and he disregarded them , the complaint seems slightly less insane . If I tell you that Ian Buruma was fired over \u201c printing the wrong article , \u201d you might cry \u201c censorship ! \u201d But I haven \u2019 t told you that the article in question was a sex criminal lying about his crimes in an effort to manipulate the public into sympathizing with him\u2014a strange piece of writing to appear in the New York Review of Books .\nCritical facts are almost always left out . In 2017 , Third World Quarterly pulled an article called \u201c The Case for Colonialism , \u201d after a petition calling for its removal . The writer said a \u201c Maoist \u201d \u201c hate mob \u201d had \u201c tried to silence me , \u201d and in the conservative press he was presented as a victim of the Pervasive Liberal Bias on campus . Left out , though , was the fact that the article was appallingly bad as a piece of scholarship . Even an article from the libertarian Cato Institute said it was \u201c empirically and historically inaccurate \u201d and \u201c misuses existing postcolonial scholarship. \u201d The arguments it made were really , really bad . It was like publishing an article denying the Holocaust . If a peer-reviewed journal had published an article denying the Holocaust , would calls to retract it be seen as \u201c politically correct \u201d \u201c Maoist \u201d thought policing , or a reasonable demand for scholarship to conform to basic intellectual and moral standards ?\nFrequently , there is far more justice in the charges made by \u201c social justice warriors \u201d than their critics want to admit . There was , for instance , always good reason why students thought Charles Murray and Milo Yiannopoulos were not figures worthy of the honor of being invited to speak at a prestigious college . But just as importantly , the \u201c outrage mobs \u201d that \u201c come for \u201d people are usually relatively powerless . Charles Murray , after all , ended up getting to speak successfully at Harvard and Yale . As Osita Nwanevu documents in an excellent essay on the myths around \u201c cancel culture , \u201d generally speaking the main thing the \u201c social justice mobs \u201d can do to people is yell at them on Twitter . And while nobody likes getting yelled at on Twitter , invoking the specter of \u201c lynch mobs , \u201d \u201c Robespierre , \u201d and \u201c Maoism \u201d is an insult to the millions of historical victims of actual violent repression by actual powerful oppressors . Nwanevu shows that generally , the \u201c problematic \u201d people end up doing just fine . They suffer reputational consequences sometimes , meaning part of the public doesn \u2019 t like them . But the actual people who end up being \u201c silenced \u201d tend not to be those who say \u201c politically incorrect \u201d things , but rather leftist dissidents who question the power structure . The suggestion that \u201c both sides \u201d are Totalitarian is willfully oblivious to who really has power in this country . We hear constantly from anti-P.C . types who are Just Asking Questions about the Forbidden Issues . The voices that vanish from discussions , on the other hand , are immigrants in detention facilities , or incarcerated men and women in Covid-ridden prisons . Far more Orwellian than anything the left does is the way the American media presented a right-wing coup in Bolivia as a restoration of democracy or the assassination of an Iranian official as something other than an international crime .\nConservatives do not want us to talk about the actual \u201c manufacturing of consent \u201d in this country , so they spin a tale about a topsy-turvy world in which college students , Black and transgender people hold all the power and rich white men are persecuted and sent to the gulag . This story should be easy to see through , because it \u2019 s so laughably at odds with reality . But when \u201c liberal \u201d academics sign onto it , as with the Harper \u2019 s letter , the \u201c moral panic \u201d around P.C . culture is given new legitimacy .\nOf course , there is a problem in this country with \u201c people getting fired over speech , \u201d like the Black Lives Matter supporter recently fired from Deloitte over a TikTok video . But the big problem here is at-will employment , not \u201c cancel culture. \u201d American workplaces are dictatorships , meaning your boss can fire you for any reason . So , if there \u2019 s even a slight controversy around you , no matter how small it is , your boss may well just can you to avoid the headache . This means that even if it \u2019 s a misunderstanding and the person accusing you deletes their accusation , you will still be let go and have no recourse , because capitalism does not give a shit whether you live or die .\nThe solution , of course , is unions . The way to prevent arbitrary firings is to make arbitrary firings impossible , by ensuring that all workers receive due process and can \u2019 t be let go except for just cause . A person \u2019 s livelihood is incredibly important , which is why the unequal bargaining power between employers and the employed is so unfair . Arguments that \u201c P.C . culture \u201d is the problem blame the left for problems that result from institutional hierarchies and imbalances of power . Our side should not accept the blame , because we are the ones who are trying to reduce the reach of police , prisons , and bosses .\nIt is frustrating when people who are not right-wing lunatics echo the language used by Donald Trump about the left . Donald Trump has risen to power by spinning tales about an America that doesn \u2019 t exist , one plagued by marauding hordes of immigrants , vandals , and Stalinists . He promises the public that he will restore a better America , one that also never existed . It is our job to expose these fictions for what they are , and provide a better vision of what could be . Having liberals and leftists endorse the right-wing myth about Totalitarian Leftist Mobs feeds into Trump \u2019 s culture war re-election strategy . We should refuse to concede , then , that the grotesque caricature of social justice movements is true . We should demand that the full facts of these \u201c canceling \u201d incidents , rather than vague innuendos and selective details , be put on the table and evaluated fairly . And we need to point to the real problems in this country , which do not come from angry anti-racists on Twitter\u2014who mostly just tweet\u2014but from a government that is letting its people die , and a class of oligarchs that couldn \u2019 t care how much ordinary people suffer so long as the stock market keeps going up .",
