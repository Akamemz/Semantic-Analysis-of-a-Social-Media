This is why Elizabeth Warren inflicted that cringe-making , \u201c I \u2019 m gon na get me a beer , \u201d video on a long-suffering electorate . It is why Joe Biden , who reputedly enjoys a special rapport with blue collar voters , is the frontrunner for his party \u2019 s presidential nomination despite his penchant for gaffes and plagiarism .

The belief that his message was resonating only among the working class was debunked by Nate Silver as early as May of 2016 :\nIt \u2019 s been extremely common for news accounts to portray Donald Trump \u2019 s candidacy as a \u201c working-class \u201d rebellion against Republican elites.\u2026 But the definition of \u201c working class \u201d and similar terms is fuzzy , and narratives like these risk obscuring an important and perhaps counterintuitive fact about Trump \u2019 s voters : As compared with most Americans , Trump \u2019 s voters are better off .
