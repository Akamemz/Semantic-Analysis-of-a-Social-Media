La Raja and Brian F. Schaffner , authors of Campaign Finance and Political Polarization : When Purists Prevail , argue that populist approaches such as imposing low contribution limits on parties , distort the campaign finance system in ways that benefit a small group of partisan purists at the expense of the broader electorate . This in turn pushes candidates towards ideological extremes . They write that reformers should consider a more party-centered campaign finance system which would channel money to candidates through highly transparent and broadly accountable party organizations , which would then lead to less polarization .\nSince the 2010 Citizens United decision , there has been increasing concern over the role of money in politics . However , our new research indicates that populist approaches to curtailing money in US politics might actually be contributing to contemporary problems in the political system , including the bitter partisan stand-offs and apparent insensitivity of elected officials to the concerns of ordinary Americans . Populist approaches to campaign finance reform tend to focus on eliminating the potential for corruption by setting relatively low contributions limits to candidates and parties . But such limits rarely stop the flow of money into politics . Instead they affect the channels through which that money travels into politicians \u2019 accounts . And increasingly , that flow pours in from highly ideological donors who tend to pull party candidates toward the extremes .\nOur main argument in our new book , Campaign Finance and Political Polarization : When Purists Prevail , is that constraints on party organizations have forced candidates to rely heavily on ideological sources of funds . While party organizations tend to be highly pragmatic , preferring to support moderate candidates who reflect the views of the broader electorate , other kinds of donors \u2013 both large and small \u2013 favor highly ideological candidates . The demise of party funding relative to other sources ( due to restrictive campaign finance laws and judicial decisions ) has contributed to the decrease in moderate officeholders in statehouses .\nOur view of party organizations runs counter to recent party \u201c network \u201d theorists who discount the importance of the formal party organizations . They claim instead that the party is really made up of the partisan network of allied interest groups , donors and activists who coordinate to help party candidates .
