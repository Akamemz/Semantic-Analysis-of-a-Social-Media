    "content": "The paradox of American gun control got deeper Wednesday . Or , at least it appeared to .\nOn the surface , the poll released by The Washington Post and Pew Research Center made no sense . Only 47 percent of respondents said they were `` disappointed '' or `` angry '' that the Senate last week failed to advance a bill to expand background checks to gun shows and online sales .\nYet in February , a Pew poll found that 83 percent of respondents supported an expansion of background checks to cover gun shows and all private sales \u2013 measures that would actually be stricter than what the Senate rejected .\nSo what gives ? If Americans overwhelmingly support strict background checks , why are n't they angrier that the Senate failed to pass even moderate background checks ? How could 39 percent be `` happy '' or `` relieved '' by the result ? Where is the outrage to which President Obama was appealing when he called the Senate vote `` a pretty shameful day for Washington '' ?\nThere are , perhaps , clues in the poll itself , which suggests that the forces against the bill were more motivated than those supporting the bill . Americans might also have come to the conclusion that the bill would n't do much .\nBut the real takeaway , some say , is that the gun control debate played into the broader narrative of America 's enduring libertarian streak .
