    "content": "Ten Democratic presidential candidates gathered today in Las Vegas , under the auspices of Giffords and March for Our Lives , to talk for a half-hour each at the `` 2020 Gun Safety Forum . '' They were questioned individually and sequentially by MSNBC anchor Craig Melvin and audience members ; most , if not all of them , connected to some anti-gun-violence group .\nCollectively , the first five candidates\u2014South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg , former HUD Secretary Julian Castro , Sen. Cory Booker ( N.J. ) , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( Mass . ) , and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2014supported a set of initiatives they insist have mass popular support , including from gun owners . They argued that these `` common sense gun safety '' proposals are stymied by a combination of President Trump ( who , they stated or implied , must be unseated before anything `` sensible '' can happen regarding new restrictions on gun owners ) and a Congress in the thrall of the gun industry and the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) , with the latter merely standing for the former , not for civil rights or the interests of their gun-owning members .\nAudience questions often steered them toward the question of the disproportionate impact of gun violence on black and brown urban communities . ( While the candidates did n't run with it , David Hogg , the student activist who was present at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018 , linked the issue of gun ownership with `` white supremacy '' without explanation . ) None of the candidates mentioned or alluded to the idea that the illegal drug trade plays a large role in that violence , and that liberalizing federal drug laws might help stem gun violence . Biden , in a complete gun law proposal issued today , does mention specific targeted interventions in affected communities , an idea that National Review 's Robert VerBruggen praises due to `` good evidence showing that they work , and they focus on specific individuals at severe risk of committing gun violence\u2014not everyday people who own guns legally .

She suggested that a slow application of every idea to make gun ownership harder or more onerous , like the constellation of safety features the federal government has mandated for cars over the decades , will add up to the results she seeks .
