MUST WATCH Carney defends Bergdahl prisoner swap 02:45\nSpeaking Tuesday in Warsaw , Poland , President Barack Obama said that Bergdahl had not then been interrogated by U.S. officials because he is still undergoing medical care . Nor had he met yet with his family , according to the President .\nBergdahl -- who was released by his Taliban captors in exchange for five prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba -- is at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany . The five prisoners headed to Qatar as part of the exchange .\nBergdahl will remain at that U.S. Army medical center in Germany until he completes treatment , a U.S. defense official there told CNN . After that , Bergdahl will return to the United States and go to a San Antonio military base , the official said .\nIn his statement Tuesday , McHugh suggested Bergdahl 's medical treatment will be a driving force in what happens next and when it does .\n`` There is no timeline for this , and we will take as long as medically necessary to aid his recovery , '' McHugh said .\nThe release of Bergdahl , the last American soldier held captive from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts , spurred celebration in many circles .\nBut others challenged the move -- including some critical because he was let go in exchange for Guantanamo detainees , plus many of those who served with Bergdahl who characterized him as a deserter whose `` selfish act '' ended up costing others ' lives .\nAccording to firsthand accounts from soldiers in his platoon , Bergdahl -- sometime before he was set to go on guard duty -- shed his weapons and walked off an observation post with nothing more than a compass , a knife , water , a digital camera and a diary .\nThe team leader , Evan Buetow , recalled to CNN 's Jake Tapper that Bergdahl `` did not agree with the war effort in Afghanistan '' and had said various things that , in retrospect , led him to believe the soldier had `` walked away . ''\n`` It was a gut feeling I had , '' Buetow said Tuesday . `` ... When he comes up missing and all of his sensitive items are left behind , it just kind of hit us in the head . ''\nAt least six soldiers were killed in subsequent searches for Bergdahl , according to soldiers involved in operations to find him . The Pentagon was not able to provide details on specific operations in which any soldiers killed during that time were involved .\nAlso , many soldiers in Bergdahl 's platoon said attacks seemed to increase against the United States in Paktika province in the days and weeks following his disappearance .\nBuetow conceded that he and others may never know if this violence was coincidental or if Bergdahl gave his captors information voluntarily or after being tortured . Yet he found it `` incredibly suspicious '' that attacks after Bergdahl disappeared seemed to become `` far more directed . ''\nAs to those U.S. soldiers who died , Buetow said , `` Those soldiers would not be on those patrols , in those specific areas when they were killed , unless Bergdahl left . And that 's a fact to me . ''\nAll this said , the exact circumstances of his disappearance are very uncertain .\nPublished accounts have varied widely , from claims that he walked off the post to claims that he was grabbed from a latrine .\nNoting everything that he left behind , an Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his 2009 disappearance concluded that Bergdahl left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report . The official spoke to CNN Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information .\nThere was no definitive finding Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials could n't do without talking to the soldier . The investigation included interviews with members of Bergdahl 's unit , none of whom reported seeing him go , the official said .\nIn 2012 , Rolling Stone reported that Bergdahl 's unit had discipline and other issues during its time in Afghanistan .\nAddressing the matter Tuesday , Obama stressed that we `` we do n't leave men and women in uniform behind '' and insisted prisoner swaps `` happen ... at the end of wars . ''\n`` Whatever the circumstances may turn out to be , we still get an American soldier back if he is held in captivity . Period . Full stop , '' Obama said . `` We do n't condition that . ''\nIntelligence indicated where Bergdahl was being held a couple of times during his five years in captivity , a U.S. official said .
