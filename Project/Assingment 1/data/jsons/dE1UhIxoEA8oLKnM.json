    "content": "Two days after trying a new CBD oil extract to treat her chronic pain , a 56-year-old woman developed an awful rash .\nHer primary care physician prescribed antihistamines and prednisone , a common steroid used to treat inflammation . She went home . The rash got worse . From a local emergency room , she went to a hospital burn unit . There , the rash went out of control .\nAngry red lesions broke out over 30 percent of her body , including her eyes and groin . Skin peeled from her arms and back . Doctors administered more antibiotics , more anti-inflammatory steroids . They didn \u2019 t work . After a month of suffering , she was dead from septic shock , the final result of a rare and extremely serious allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) , according to an account published February in Case Reports in Ophthalmological Medicine .\nDescribed by the Mayo Clinic as both \u201c rare and unpredictable , \u201d Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is typically triggered by \u201c a medication , an infection or both. \u201d According to the British NHS , among the \u201c medicines that most commonly cause \u201d the affliction is the \u201c oxicam \u201d family of anti-inflammatory drugs . The woman had been taking meloxicam for arthritis , but that \u2019 s not what killed her , according to the case report , written by a group of eye doctors from SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse , New York . She had already been on meloxicam without any reported complications , after all .\nWhat set off the fatal allergic reaction , they claim , was the product she had tried . It was a new brand of cannabidiol ( CBD ) oil she was taking for back pain ; she had previously taken other CBD brands without issue . Though the new CBD oil she used was not tested for impurities , either some unknown ingredient in the oil or some reaction triggered by the CBD was the most likely cause of the allergic reaction and subsequent death , the doctors wrote , published under the title \u201c Commercial Cannabis Oil\u2013Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome . \u201d\nIf true , the news that a cannabis product killed someone would amount to the upending of a longstanding claim from weed legalization advocates that the drug is so safe no one has ever died from it . And this wasn \u2019 t a case of high-THC cannabis allegedly causing psychosis\u2014it was a possible reaction to CBD oil , an increasingly popular and widely available wellness product in the United States .\nPhysicians and medical professionals with expertise in cannabis consulted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 were divided on the merits of the medical journal article . But though they argued over the value of the case study and what ( if anything ) it means , one common theme emerged : it \u2019 s still the Wild West days for CBD , a drug that is still poorly studied , poorly understood and\u2014with products of wildly varying potency and purity available online in all 50 states , at gas stations and novelty shops and corner bodegas\u2014almost entirely unregulated .\nNews of the \u201c first death caused by CBD \u201d made ripples in the weed world and on social media . Project CBD , a cannabidiol advocacy organization , published a rebuttal that criticized \u201c CBD skeptics and click-bait confabulators \u201d rushing to blame a cannabis product , while raising the possibility that the oil could have reacted with the woman \u2019 s medications to fatal effect .\nPeter Grinspoon is a physician on staff at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School who frequently blogs about cannabis and other drugs on Harvard \u2019 s website ( his father is Lester Grinspoon , the Harvard psychiatrist who authored Marihuana Reconsidered , one of the bibles of cannabis-policy reform , in the 1960s ) . Grinspoon was skeptical that the death had much to do with CBD .\n\u201c It 's unlikely that this is the first case in 5,000 years of a cannabinoid causing Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) , but it is certainly possible , \u201d he said .\nGrinspoon allowed that CBD could have inhibited liver enzymes metabolizing the meloxicam , raising its potency and lowering the body \u2019 s defenses , thus triggering the allergic reaction . It \u2019 s possible that the CBD , the meloxicam and the other pharmaceuticals the woman was taking could have set off a sort of perfect storm .\nBut since the SUNY ophthalmologists did not analyze the CBD oil\u2014and offered up theoretical adulterants as a cause , apparently without knowing whether they were in the CBD product or not\u2014 \u201c they have no idea , really , what this patient consumed , and it seems sort of intellectually reckless to pin the death on CBD , \u201d Grinspoon said .\n\u201c Researchers are always eager to try to be the first ones to tie a death to a cannabinoid as this gets you in the news , \u201d he added .\nSome experts were even more dismissive of the case study . \u201c I think the paper is shite , \u201d Jeffrey Hergenrather , a physician and former president of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians , wrote in an email . \u201c Regarding CBD and the association with SJS , I \u2019 ve never heard of such a thing . \u201d\nThe case report did not address what possible contaminant in the offending CBD oil might have been and what it might have done . Nor did it state the size and frequency of the CBD dose taken or any of the patient \u2019 s genetic factors that might have been an equal or greater risk factor for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome , he said . Instead , the authors went straight to the CBD\u2014and that , he pointed out , is a classic tell of anti-cannabis bias . \u201c As usual it is easy to publish a case report implicating harm with a cannabis product , \u201d he said . \u201c Cannabis is an easy target for assertions of harm . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t remember seeing any other case reports associated with cannabidiol , but that being said , we don \u2019 t know what else was in the cannabidiol products that might be associated with this type of disorder , \u201d said Ziva Cooper , a pharmacologist and the research director at the University of California , Los Angeles \u2019 s Cannabis Research Initiative .\nSide effects of drugs like meloxicam are known because \u201c thousands of people \u201d using it \u201c have been tracked . And this has not been the case with cannabidiol , \u201d she said .\nThe case report notes that the \u201c new liposomal CBD extract spray \u201d came from Natural Native , a CBD company based in Oklahoma . Last November , the company received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration . On Facebook and on its website , Natural Native broke several FDA rules for marketing CBD water , marketing CBD products intended for infants and otherwise making scientific claims that suggested CBD was a drug that could help with health conditions ranging from acne to chronic pain to cancer . ( CBD is a \u201c drug \u201d in the taxonomical sense , but in the legal sense , a drug needs FDA approval to be marketed as such . )\nIn this , the company is hardly unique .

The title , Bannister pointed out , is \u201c Commercial Cannabis Oil-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome , \u201d which sounds conclusive . Only toward the end of the report \u2019 s discussion section do the authors admit that it \u2019 s still \u201c unclear if marijuana-derived/CBD products can induce \u201d SJS , and that it \u2019 s a subject that requires more study as well as general clinical awareness .\n\u201c He should take that assertive assumption out of the title , \u201d Bannister said . \u201c Even turning it into a question .
