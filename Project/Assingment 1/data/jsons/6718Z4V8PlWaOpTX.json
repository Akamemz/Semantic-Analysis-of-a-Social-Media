    "content": "The US Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine whether the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority when it sought to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act .\nIn a potential landmark case with substantial implications for the environmental health of the country as well as the health of the US economy , the high court said it would take up six of nine separate petitions filed with the court seeking review of the agency \u2019 s actions .\nMore than 70 business groups and public policy organizations , plus 13 states , filed petitions asking the high court to review various aspects of the EPA \u2019 s new regulations .\nSome argued that the EPA \u2019 s broad reading of the Clean Air Act to allow the agency to enact and enforce a range of regulations of carbon dioxide usurped power reserved exclusively to Congress .\nBut the high court declined to hear petitions challenging the EPA \u2019 s so-called endangerment finding \u2013 that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare . That finding triggered EPA authority to move forward with greenhouse gas regulations .\nIn denying three petitions but granting six others , the high court signaled that it will focus on issues further down the regulatory process .\nSpecifically , the court agreed to answer a single question : \u201c Whether EPA permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases , \u201d the justices said in an order Tuesday .\nStationary sources include power plants , refineries , petrochemical plants , and heavy industry facilities .\nRegulation of emissions of greenhouse gases is a high priority of the Obama administration .\nMost environmental experts maintain that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to global warming , including sea rise increases and more violent weather patterns . Other scientists say the data are unclear , and they question the connection between greenhouse gas emissions and fluctuations in atmospheric temperatures .\nIndustry groups have warned that EPA regulations would cost billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs , stalling the already-sluggish economic recovery . They say such profound policy decisions should be debated and approved by Congress rather than imposed by a regulatory agency .\nLawyers for the US Chamber of Commerce said in their brief the new regulations are \u201c the costliest , farthest reaching , and most intrusive regulatory apparatus in the history of the American administrative state . \u201d\nThe regulations , they said , could eventually \u201c touch practically every aspect of every industry across the entire economy . \u201d\nA range of environmental groups and 17 states filed briefs supporting the EPA action and urging the Supreme Court to decline to hear any of the appeals .\nLawyers for the environmental groups argued in their briefs that the EPA \u2019 s regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gases had gone well and that warnings about dire consequences for the nation are unfounded .\n\u201c No petitioner can credibly contend that the impact of greenhouse gas regulation as actually implemented is unreasonable or oppressive , \u201d they said . \u201c Permitting is proceeding at a reasonable pace across the country and across industrial sectors . \u201d\nIn the first two years , they said , fewer than 200 large emitters \u2013 mostly electric power generators and natural gas processing plants \u2013 applied for permits . The process includes consideration of cost and is subject to judicial review , they said .\nCritics of the EPA regulatory moves disagree . EPA officials , they argue , usurped the role of Congress to substantially expand the federal agency \u2019 s power to fight global warming .\nThe case went to the federal appeals court in Washington , D.C. , which last year rejected industry complaints and upheld the EPA \u2019 s actions .\nThe three-judge panel cited a 2007 US Supreme Court decision , Massachusetts v. EPA , that held that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that could be covered by the Clean Air Act .\nIn the 5-to-4 decision , the high court said the agency had a duty to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act if the EPA determined that greenhouse gases and related global warming pose a threat to public health and welfare .\nThe issue arose during the Bush administration , when the EPA refused to broaden enforcement of the Clean Air Act to include greenhouse gases .\nIn contrast , the EPA under President Obama has welcomed the opportunity to use the Clean Air Act to fight climate change . And the federal appeals court endorsed the Obama administration \u2019 s expansive application of the antipollution law .\n\u201c To be sure , the stakes here are high . The underlying policy questions and the outcome of this case are undoubtedly matters of exceptional importance , \u201d the appeals court said .\nThe judges went on to note that the legal dispute involved a straightforward reading of the clean air statute and application of binding Supreme Court precedent to that statute .\nPrior to appealing to the Supreme Court , lawyers for the industry groups asked the full appeals court to take up the case . It declined .\nIn a dissent from the appeals court decision not to rehear the case , Judge Brett Kavanaugh said regardless of how the case is decided , it would have \u201c massive real-world consequences . \u201d\nJudge Kavanaugh said the EPA \u2019 s broad interpretation of \u201c air pollutant \u201d allowed it to expand the reach of federal regulation to include greenhouse gases . And that would expand the reach of the agency \u2019 s regulations .\nBut the expansion raised a problem within the statutory framework . Congress set thresholds for harmful pollutants that would require permits \u2013 250 million tons per year for some facilities and 100 million tons for others .\nThe limits were set for six specifically identified pollutants \u2013 carbon monoxide , lead , nitrogen dioxide , ozone , particle pollution , and sulfur dioxide .\nHigh concentrations of these pollutants in the air are considered capable of causing an immediate threat to human health . The Clean Air Act is aimed at addressing that threat .\nIn contrast , the threat from greenhouse gases is considered more remote . Greenhouse gases \u2013 such as carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxide , and hydrofluorocarbons \u2013 do not themselves pose an immediate threat to human health .\nBut the EPA is claiming broad regulatory power to address those wider threats to public welfare said to be posed by greenhouse gases and global warming .\nIn its endangerment finding , the EPA concluded that unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and the welfare of current and future generations . Global warming , the agency concluded , would increase heat-related deaths and respiratory illnesses , boost the risks to health from violent hurricanes and other extreme weather events , and increase the prevalence of food and waterborne diseases .\nClimate change could have adverse impacts on US food production , endanger forestry , increase the risk of extreme flooding and drought , increase the risk of storm surge and flooding related to sea level increases , and pose negative consequences for ecosystems and wildlife worldwide .\nCritics of the EPA \u2019 s push to regulate greenhouse gases as if they are another variety of toxic pollutants argue that the problem is that greenhouse gases \u2013 like carbon dioxide and methane \u2013 are emitted in much larger quantities by a much larger universe of emitters .\nMillions of industrial , residential , and commercial sources exceed existing regulatory levels .\nIf the original statutory thresholds for air pollution were applied to greenhouse gas emissions , the EPA would be unable to process all the permit applications . In addition to large industrial facilities , the new regulations could potentially also sweep in tens of thousands of lesser emitters including apartment buildings , large homes , schools , and hospitals , critics say .\nUnder established Clean Air Act thresholds , the number of permits would jump from 14,700 to 6.1 million . The new rules would require $ 22.5 billion in paperwork costs alone and additional billions in compliance costs , these critics say .\nRecognizing this , the EPA rewrote the threshold for greenhouse gases . Rather than 250 tons , the agency set the limit at 100,000 tons . The action is unusual because the 250-ton restriction was written into the statute by Congress .\n\u201c This is a very strange way to interpret a statute , \u201d Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent .\n\u201c When an agency is faced with two initially plausible readings of a statutory term , but it turns out that one reading would cause absurd results , I am aware of no precedent that suggests the agency can still choose the absurd reading and then start rewriting other perfectly clear portions of the statute to try to make it all work out . \u201d\nThe judge added : \u201c Allowing agencies to exercise that kind of statutory re-writing authority could significantly enhance the Executive Branch \u2019 s power at the expense of Congress \u2019 s and thereby alter the relative balance of powers in the administrative process . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
