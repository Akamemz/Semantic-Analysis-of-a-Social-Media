Send us your experiences , but please stay safe .\nCairo ( CNN ) -- Egypt 's military toppled the country 's first democratically elected president Wednesday night and reportedly put him under house arrest while rounding up some of his top supporters even as the deposed Mohamed Morsy insisted that he remains the country 's legitimate leader .\nHundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Egypt over the military 's actions that were decried by Morsy 's supporters as a `` coup '' and celebrated as a `` correction '' by his opponents . At least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in sporadic violence that at times pitted Morsy 's supporters against the opposition and the military .\nMorsy `` did not achieve the goals of the people '' and failed to meet the generals ' demands that he share power with his opposition , Egypt 's top military officer , Gen.
