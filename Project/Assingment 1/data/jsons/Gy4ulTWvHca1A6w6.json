Trump (24 percent), Rubio (16 percent) and Carson (11 percent) also get double-digit backing.\n\nHonest and Trustworthy Revisited\n\nEarlier this month, Carson was the only 2016 candidate deemed honest and trustworthy by a majority of voters: 60 percent said he was (November 1-3, 2015). Since then, some reporters -- and Trump -- have questioned whether everything in Carson\u2019s new book is true.\n\nThe attacks seem to have pushed Carson\u2019s honesty ratings down: today 53 percent of all voters say he is honest, while 34 percent say he isn\u2019t.

By a 51-31 percent margin, voters say he is honest and trustworthy (+20 points), up from 41-36 percent earlier this month.\n\nCruz (+11 points), Fiorina (+5 points) and Bush (+4 points) also get positive honesty scores.\n\nTrump gets a negative 14 honesty score (41 percent honest vs. 55 percent not).
