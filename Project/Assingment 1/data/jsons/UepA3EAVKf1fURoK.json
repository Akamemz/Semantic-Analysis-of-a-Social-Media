    "content": "In a surprise announcement that could derail a major trade deal , President Donald Trump says he is placing a 5 % tariff on all Mexican imports , effective June 10 , to pressure the country to do more to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border .\nTrump said the percentage will gradually increase \u2014 up to 25 % \u2014 `` until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied . ''\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador quickly fired back in a letter to Trump saying that `` social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures '' adding that he was dispatching his foreign relations secretary to Washington Friday to try to negotiate a solution .\nThe decision showed the administration going to new lengths , and looking for new levers , to pressure Mexico to take action \u2014 even if those risk upending other policy priorities , like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement , a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump 's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort . It also risks further damaging the already strained relationship between the U.S. and Mexico , two countries whose economies are deeply intertwined .\nTrump made the announcement by tweet after telling reporters earlier Thursday that he was planning `` a major statement '' that would be his `` biggest '' so far on the border .\n`` On June 10th , the United States will impose a 5 % Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico , until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico , and into our Country , STOP , '' he wrote . `` The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied . ''\nIn his response , the Mexican president also alluded to the United States ' history as a nation of immigrants . `` The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol , '' he wrote .\nTrump , in his growing fury over an increase in border crossings that he has likened to an `` invasion , '' has blamed Mexico for failing to stop the flow of asylum seekers from countries like El Salvador and Honduras who pass through its territory . And he has been itching to take increasingly radical , headline-grabbing action on the issue , which he sees as critical to his 2020 campaign because it energizes his base .\nBut the sudden tariff threat comes at a peculiar time , given how hard the administration has been pushing for passage of the USMCA , which would update the North American Free Trade Agreement . It comes less than two weeks after Trump lifted import taxes on Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum , a move that seemed to clear an obstacle to its passage , and the same day that both Trump and L\u00f3pez Obrador began the process of seeking ratification . The deal needs approval from lawmakers in all three countries before it takes effect .\n`` The tariffs certainly put the USMCA on ice , '' said Gary Hufbauer , an expert in trade law at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , who panned the move but said Trump does have the legal authority to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by citing a national emergency .\nDaniel Ujczo , a U.S.-based international trade lawyer , said the threat would likely slow the deal 's progress in Mexico and put U.S. lawmakers who want to vote `` yes '' in a difficult position because companies in their districts will end up paying the tariffs .\nStill , Ujczo and others wondered whether Trump \u2014 who has a habit of creating problems and then claiming credit when he rushes in to solve them \u2014 would go through with the threat .\n`` This seems more theater and tactics than a strategy to solve the migration crisis and rebalance North American trade , '' Ujczo said .\nIt would n't be the first time Trump has punted on an immigration threat . In late March , Trump threatened to shut the entire U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico did n't immediately halt illegal immigration . Just a few days later , he backed off the threat , saying he was pleased with steps Mexico had taken in recent days . It was unclear , however , what Mexico had changed .\nIndeed , on a briefing call with reporters Thursday evening , administration officials said Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing their southern border with Guatemala , cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations , and entering into a `` safe third country agreement '' that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S .\n`` We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they 're able to do that , these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place , '' said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney .\nHe also insisted that tariffs were `` completely '' separate from the USMCA because one pertained to immigration and the other trade .\nStill the threat drew a withering response from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley , a usual Trump ally , who slammed it as `` a misuse of presidential tariff authority '' that would burden American consumers and `` seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA . ''\nMulvaney said the White House had briefed a number of Republicans on the plan and acknowledged that some \u2014 particularly in the Senate \u2014 had raised concerns about the president invoking such powers .\nThe threat comes at a time when Mexico has already been stepping up its efforts to crack down on migrants , carrying out raids and detaining thousands of people traveling through the country en route to the U.S .\nThe crumbling city of Tapachula , near the Guatemalan border , has become the epicenter of the crackdowns , with thousands of migrants stranded because the Mexican government is n't providing them visas to travel .
