    "content": "Dr. David S. Glosser is a retired neuropsychologist : formerly a member of the Neurology faculties of Boston University School of Medicine and Jefferson Medical College .\nLet me tell you a story about Stephen Miller and chain migration .\nIt begins at the turn of the 20th century , in a dirt-floor shack in the village of Antopol , a shtetl of subsistence farmers in what is now Belarus . Beset by violent anti-Jewish pogroms and forced childhood conscription in the Czar \u2019 s army , the patriarch of the shack , Wolf-Leib Glosser , fled a village where his forebears had lived for centuries and took his chances in America .\nHe set foot on Ellis Island on January 7 , 1903 , with $ 8 to his name . Though fluent in Polish , Russian and Yiddish , he understood no English . An elder son , Nathan , soon followed . By street corner peddling and sweatshop toil , Wolf-Leib and Nathan sent enough money home to pay off debts and buy the immediate family \u2019 s passage to America in 1906 . That group included young Sam Glosser , who with his family settled in the western Pennsylvania city of Johnstown , a booming coal and steel town that was a magnet for other hardworking immigrants . The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather , Sam , and the next generation of Glossers , including my dad , Izzy . It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time . In the span of some 80 years and five decades , this family emerged from poverty in a hostile country to become a prosperous , educated clan of merchants , scholars , professionals , and , most important , American citizens .\nWhat does this classically American tale have to do with Stephen Miller ? Well , Izzy Glosser is his maternal grandfather , and Stephen \u2019 s mother , Miriam , is my sister .\nI have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew , an educated man who is well aware of his heritage , has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family \u2019 s life in this country .\nI shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses\u2014 the travel ban , the radical decrease in refugees , the separation of children from their parents , and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants \u2014 been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom . The Glossers came to the U.S. just a few years before the fear and prejudice of the \u201c America first \u201d nativists of the day closed U.S. borders to Jewish refugees . Had Wolf-Leib waited , his family likely would have been murdered by the Nazis along with all but seven of the 2,000 Jews who remained in Antopol . I would encourage Stephen to ask himself if the chanting , torch-bearing Nazis of Charlottesville , whose support his boss seems to court so cavalierly , do not envision a similar fate for him .\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine \u2019 s email of the week \u2019 s best , delivered to your inbox every Friday morning .

True , Jews were excluded from many occupations , couldn \u2019 t buy homes in some towns , couldn \u2019 t join certain organizations or attend certain schools or universities , but life was good . As in past generations , there were hate mongers who regarded the most recent groups of poor immigrants as scum , rapists , gangsters , drunks and terrorists , but largely the Glosser family was left alone to live our lives and build the American dream . Children were born , synagogues founded , and we thrived . This was the miracle of America .\nActing for so long in the theater of right-wing politics , Stephen and Trump may have become numb to the resultant human tragedy and blind to the hypocrisy of their policy decisions . After all , Stephen \u2019 s is not the only family with a chain immigration story in the Trump administration . Trump 's grandfather is reported to have been a German migrant on the run from military conscription to a new life in the United States , and his mother fled the poverty of rural Scotland for the economic possibilities of New York City . ( Trump \u2019 s in-laws just became citizens on the strength of his wife \u2019 s own citizenship . )\nThese facts are important not only for their grim historical irony but because vulnerable people are being hurt . They are real people , not the ghoulish caricatures portrayed by Trump . When confronted by the deaths and suffering of thousands , our senses are overwhelmed , and the victims become statistics rather than people . I meet these statistics one at a time through my volunteer service as a neuropsychologist for the Philadelphia affiliate of HIAS ( formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society ) , the global nonprofit that protects refugees and helped my family more than 100 years ago . I will share the story of one such man I have met in the hopes that my nephew might recognize elements of our shared heritage .\nIn the early 2000s , Joseph ( not his real name ) was conscripted at the age of 14 to be a soldier in Eritrea and sent to a remote desert military camp . Officers there discovered a Bible under his pillow which aroused their suspicion that he might belong to a foreign evangelical sect that would claim his loyalty and sap his will to fight . Joseph was actually a member of the state-approved Coptic church but was nonetheless immediately subjected to torture . \u201c They smashed my face into the ground , tied my hands and feet together behind my back , stomped on me , and hung me from a tree by my bonds while they beat me with batons for the others to see . \u201d\nJoseph was tortured for 20 consecutive days before being taken to a military prison and crammed into a dark unventilated cell with 36 other men , little food and no proper hygiene . Some died , and in time Joseph was stricken with dysentery . When he was too weak to stand , he was taken to a civilian clinic where he was fed by the medical staff . Upon regaining his strength , he escaped to a nearby road where a sympathetic driver took him north through the night to a camp in Sudan where he joined other refugees . Joseph was on the first leg of a journey that would cover thousands of miles and almost 10 years .\nBefore Donald Trump had started his political ascent promulgating the false story that Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim , while my nephew , Stephen , was famously recovering from the hardships of his high school cafeteria in Santa Monica , Joseph was a child on his own in Sudan in fear of being deported back to Eritrea to face execution for desertion . He worked any job he could get , saved his money and made his way through Sudan . He endured arrest and extortion in Libya . He returned to Sudan , then kept moving to Dubai , Brazil and eventually to a southern border crossing into Texas , where he sought asylum . In all of the countries he traveled through during his ordeal , he was vulnerable , exploited and his status was \u201c illegal. \u201d But in the United States , he had a chance to acquire the protection of a documented immigrant .\nToday , at 30 , Joseph lives in Pennsylvania and has a wife and child . He is a smart , warm , humble man of great character who is grateful for every day of his freedom and safety . He bears emotional scars from not seeing his parents or siblings since he was 14 . He still trembles , cries and struggles for breath when describing his torture , and he bears physical scars as well . He hopes to become a citizen , return to work and make his contribution to America . His story , though unique in its particulars , is by no means unusual . I have met Central Americans fleeing corrupt governments , violence and criminal extortion ; a Yemeni woman unable to return to her war-ravaged home country and fearing sexual mutilation if she goes back to her Saudi husband ; and an escaped kidnap-bride from central Asia .\nTrump wants to make us believe that these desperate migrants are an existential threat to the United States ; the most powerful nation in world history and a nation made strong by immigrants . Trump and my nephew both know their immigrant and refugee roots . Yet , they repeat the insults and false accusations of earlier generations against these refugees to make them seem less than human . Trump publicly parades the grieving families of people hurt or killed by migrants , just as the early Nazis dredged up Jewish criminals to frighten and enrage their political base to justify persecution of all Jews . Almost every American family has an immigration story of its own based on flight from war , poverty , famine , persecution , fear or hopelessness . Most of these immigrants became workers , entrepreneurs , scientists and soldiers of America .\nMost damning is the administration 's evident intent to make policy that specifically disadvantages people based on their ethnicity , country of origin and religion . No matter what opinion is held about immigration , any government that specifically enacts law or policy on that basis must be recognized as a threat to all of us . Laws bereft of justice are the gateway to tyranny . Today others may be the target , but tomorrow it might just as easily be you or me . History will be the judge , but in the meantime the normalization of these policies is rapidly eroding the collective conscience of America . Immigration reform is a complex issue that will require compassion and wisdom to bring the nation to a just solution , but the politicians who have based their political and professional identity on ethnic demonization and exclusion can not be trusted to do so . As free Americans , and descendants of immigrants and refugees , we have the obligation to exercise our conscience by voting for candidates who will stand up for our highest national values and not succumb to our lowest fears .",
