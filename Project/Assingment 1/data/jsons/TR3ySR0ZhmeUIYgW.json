Jerry Brown.

Farmers are plowing up fields where they used to grow vegetables like broccoli, carrots and tomatoes to put in nut and fruit trees, which demand less water.\n\n\"Cotton has gone from 1.5 million acres to almost nothing.

AND WHO BENEFITS\n\nBusinesses ready to help consumers and businesses change their behavior \u2014 and save them money in lower water bills \u2014 should do well in California's browner landscape.\n\nWith strict water use rules coming, anyone who wants a yard that doesn't look like a dust bowl needs to redesign and replant.
