Keystone and the Udall-Gardner race\nThis story is part of an ongoing \u2588\u2588\u2588 series on how national policy issues are affecting the 2014 midterm elections .\nWELD COUNTY , Colo. \u2014 For Democrats hoping to hold on to the Senate , the fault line in U.S. energy politics runs through communities like this rural enclave in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains .\nThis county north of Denver is central to Colorado \u2019 s fracking boom , a place where oil and gas equipment dots the countryside and there \u2019 s one active well for every dozen or so residents . Its congressman , Rep. Cory Gardner , is a rising Republican star \u2014 and he \u2019 s threatening to unseat freshman Democratic Sen. Mark Udall , who is caught in the middle on energy issues that have split his party , including the Keystone XL oil pipeline and proposals to place fracking restrictions on the state \u2019 s November ballot .\nThe contest is playing out in a state whose oil and gas industry accounted for nearly 48,000 jobs and more than $ 3 billion in employee income in 2012 , according to a University of Colorado study . But the state also has a long conservation heritage , and the spread of oil and gas production has stirred a backlash in some previously untouched towns .\nThe push-pull between environmental stewardship and job creation in Colorado has echoes in other states touched by the surge in North American energy production , from California to Pennsylvania . And it shows how intensely a national policy issue can play out locally \u2014 voter by voter , community by community \u2014 in a race that may tip the balance of power in Washington .\nMuch like President Barack Obama , Udall offers nuanced positions on some of the hottest energy controversies : He insists he has no stance on the merits of Keystone , saying , \u201c I don \u2019 t think we should make a final decision until we see what the science tells us. \u201d He supports fracking , if it \u2019 s done responsibly .
