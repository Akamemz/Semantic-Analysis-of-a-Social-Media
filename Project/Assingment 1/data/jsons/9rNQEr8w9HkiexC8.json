John McCain of Arizona said Thursday he can not support the GOP \u2019 s last-ditch plan to replace Obamacare , likely dooming the effort and President Trump \u2019 s pursuit of a major legislative victory .\nMr. McCain , a Republican , was among three senators who killed off the repeal effort in July , but GOP leaders hoped he would back a plan sponsored by his good pal , Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana .\nIn a statement , Mr. McCain said the plan was being rushed through without a sober analysis of its impact .\n\u201c I can not in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal , \u201d he said . \u201c I believe we could do better working together , Republicans and Democrats , and have not yet really tried . Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost , how it will effect insurance premiums , and how many people will be helped or hurt by it . \u201d\nRepublicans must pin down 50 votes to pass the plan before a Sept. 30 deadline to act under the 2017 budget .\nIts arcane rules allow the GOP to avoid a Democratic filibuster , with Vice President Mike Pence acting as tie-breaker .\nYet Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has refused to back the proposal , saying it leaves too much of Obamacare in place , and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has voiced concerns , meaning GOP leaders probably won \u2019 t be able to scrape together enough votes .\nThe plan isn \u2019 t dead just yet , though Mrs. Collins told Maine voters on Friday she was \u201c leaning against the bill , \u201d according to the Portland Press-Herald .\nSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , who joined Mr. McCain and Mrs. Collins in blocking the July effort , is also a hard sell for GOP leaders .\nBill sponsors had exuded confidence in recent days , saying they were getting closer by the day to pinning down needed support , and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he planned to bring the bill to the floor .\nBut Mr. McCain said his colleagues were emphasizing next week \u2019 s deadline over thoughtful reforms .\n\u201c I would consider supporting legislation similar to that offered by my friends Senators Graham and [ Bill ] Cassidy were it the product of extensive hearings , debate and amendment , \u201d he said . \u201c But that has not been the case .
