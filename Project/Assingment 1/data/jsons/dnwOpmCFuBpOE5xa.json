Immigrants \u2019 rights groups and lawyers told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that ICE also increased its enforcement activities\u2014including , in some cases , in apartment buildings\u2014in a number of cities around the country , including Atlanta , Phoenix , Charlotte , and Austin .\nICE officials and the White House say this is normal .
