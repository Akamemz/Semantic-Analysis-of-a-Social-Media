    "content": "A new bill proposed in the California State Senate would completely eliminate income tax for teachers who have been in the profession for six years . Senate Bill 807 , also known as the Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act , is an attempt to provide incentives for teachers to stay in the profession in a state troubled by a shortage of educators .\nIn many parts of the United States , teachers continue to face low pay and high burnout rates despite the importance of the profession . The California bill would be the first of its kind in both the state and the country to attempt to incentivize veteran teachers in this way . But while most agree that addressing the problem is important , the idea of using the untested strategy has raised questions as to whether such an expensive program would be effective in addressing the larger issues in the teaching industry .\nThere are a number of reasons for the teacher shortage in California and the rest of the US , says David Steiner , executive director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy in Baltimore .\n`` There is a particular shortage of teachers for children with special needs and for those who speak English as a second language , '' Dr. Steiner tells The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email . `` The area shortages have multiple causes , but are especially acute in places like San Francisco where the cost of housing is prohibitive for teachers on their salaries . ''\nIn California , high demand and low supply of teachers has resulted in the hiring of many under-qualified teachers and substitutes . Often , current teachers are asked to take on classes outside their fields of expertise .\n`` There are [ also ] significant concerns about the health and retirement benefits that are being cut from teacher contracts , '' John Craven , a professor of education at the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University in New York , tells the Monitor via email . `` In some states and localities , the employer contributions to retirement packages are negligible . So teachers seeking to contribute to their own retirement packages face an even greater budgetary constraints ( as they relate to low salaries ) . This is particularly true of new teachers . ''\nAll of these problems contribute to the reluctance of potential teachers to commit to the field of education , especially in disadvantaged communities , he adds .\nThe California bill would attempt to rectify the issue by allowing first-time teachers to receive a tax credit amounting to about a 3.4 percent salary increase . Educators that have been teaching for six years or more , however , would see all income tax disappear completely , bumping up their salaries between 4 and 6 percent for the next 10 years .\nAll those tax breaks add up to about $ 617.5 million annually for the state , not an insignificant figure . But by investing in the new system , lawmakers believe that the program would lower the high turnover rate among teachers and economically benefit the state in the long run .\n`` Teachers are the original job creators , '' said Democratic state Sen.
