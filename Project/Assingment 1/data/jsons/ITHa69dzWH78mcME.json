    "content": "That supposed FBI investigation of collusion with the Russians ? Never mind . . .\nThey \u2019 re in retreat now . You may have missed it amid President Trump \u2019 s startling Saturday tweet storm , the recriminations over president-on-candidate spying , and the Jeff Sessions recusal \u2014 a whirlwind weekend . But while you weren \u2019 t looking , an elaborate narrative died .\nFor months , the media-Democrat complex has peddled a storyline that the Putin regime in Russia hacked the U.S. presidential election . There is , of course , no evidence that the election was hacked in the sense that the actual voting process was compromised . Rather , there is evidence that e-mail accounts of prominent Democrats were hacked months before the election , and thousands of those e-mails were published by WikiLeaks in the months leading up to the election .\nInto this misleading \u201c Russia hacked the election \u201d narrative , the press and the Dems injected a second explosive allegation \u2014 or at least an explosive suspicion that they \u2019 ve wanted us to perceive as a credible allegation meriting a serious investigation . The suspicion/allegation is : Not only did Russia hack the election , but there are also enough ties between people in the Trump orbit and operatives of the Putin regime that there are grounds to believe that the Trump campaign was complicit in Russia \u2019 s hacking of the election .\nTransparently , the aim is to undermine the legitimacy of Trump \u2019 s election victory .\nFinally , the third prong , without the support of which the stool would collapse : the impression that the FBI has been feverishly investigating what is said to be the Trump campaign \u2019 s collusion in what is said to be the Russian hacking of the election . This reporting is designed to get you saying to yourself : \u201c Why would there be such a zealous investigation by FBI agents \u2014 in addition to several other intelligence and law-enforcement agents \u2014 unless there really were grave reasons to believe the shocking election-hacking conspiracy narrative ? \u201d\nThus , details about investigative activity have been leaked to the media . The press and the Democrats then exploit the leaks to spin the \u201c Trump complicity in Russian election-hacking \u201d story . It seems not to matter how objectively ill-conceived the Russian election-hacking claim is , or how woefully insufficient the purported Trump\u2013Russia ties are to support an inference of campaign collusion in the hacking . The specter of an investigation \u2014 breathless media reports of FISA-court applications , wiretaps , surveillance of agents of a foreign power , and mysterious servers ; painstaking analysis of shady financial transactions involving Russian banks and funding streams \u2014 seems to make the outlandish conspiracy impossible to dismiss out of hand .\nA New York Times report perfectly illustrates the three-prong scheme . On January 19 , under the alarming headline \u201c Intercepted Russian Communications Part of Inquiry into Trump Associates , \u201d the paper began its report as follows :\nWASHINGTON \u2014 American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump , including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort , current and former senior American officials said . The continuing counterintelligence investigation means that Mr. Trump will take the oath of office on Friday with his associates under investigation and after the intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government had worked to help elect him . As president , Mr. Trump will oversee those agencies and have the authority to redirect or stop at least some of these efforts .\nCould what \u2019 s going on be more obvious ? The Times would have you believe that the Russians \u201c worked to help elect \u201d Trump because the intelligence agencies have said so . With this ballyhooed conclusion as the premise , law-enforcement and intelligence agencies are conducting a \u201c counterintelligence investigation \u201d \u2014 meaning that there may be crimes involved , as well as activities of a foreign power in the United States \u2014 to determine the nature of links between Russian officials ( who , remember , helped elect Trump ) and Trump associates connected to the Trump campaign . The probe , we \u2019 re further told , is \u201c broad \u201d and includes \u201c intercepted communications \u201d \u2014 which , to any informed person , strongly suggests that the FBI went to a federal court and laid out probable cause of improprieties , which prompted one or more judges to authorize wiretaps and potentially other forms of electronic surveillance ( e.g. , e-mail intercepts ) .\nIs there an innocent interpretation of all this ? Of course there is . After all , the underlying allegation of an election-hacking conspiracy between the Putin regime and the Trump campaign is nonsense , so there must necessarily be an innocent interpretation . And , lo and behold , the Times itself provides it \u2014 further down in the story , after all the sensational conspiracy mongering :\nIt is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign , or Mr. Trump himself . It is also unclear whether the inquiry has anything to do with an investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s computers and other attempts to disrupt the elections in November .\nSee ? It is entirely possible that the FBI and other investigative agencies are not pursuing , and have never pursued , a Trump-campaign angle on the hacking . It is entirely possible ( though I have doubts about this ) that there are no FISA national-security wiretaps directed at Trump associates \u2014 maybe the \u201c intercepted communications \u201d touted by the Times came from surveillance targeting Russian operatives whom Trump associates , perhaps unwittingly , happened to run into while doing business that had nothing to do with the campaign . I think , based on all the reporting we \u2019 ve seen ( some of which , as the Weekly Standard \u2019 s Steve Hayes observes , is thinly supported ) , it is more likely that the feds got FISA surveillance authorization for some associates of Trump ( the names of Paul Manafort , Roger Stone , and Carter Page are mentioned ) . But maybe the probable cause for any such surveillance involved those associates \u2019 own business dealings with Russia \u2014 having nothing to do with Trump or the Trump campaign .\nBut the innocent interpretation , the more likely interpretation , is not what the media and Democrats have wanted us to believe .\nFor months , they have titillated their audience with the election-hacking conspiracy fantasy . When they cover their behinds by mentioning the possibility of innocence , it is in the fine print .\nBut still , the media and Democrats have always had a serious vulnerability here \u2014 one they \u2019 ve never acknowledged because they \u2019 ve been too swept away by the political success of the fantasy narrative . It is this : At a certain point , if compelling evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to steal the election did not materialize , the much more interesting question becomes \u201c How did the government obtain all this information that has been leaked to the media to prop up the story ? \u201d\nThe most plausible answer to that question : The Obama administration , through the Justice Department and the FBI , was investigating the associates of the opposition party \u2019 s presidential nominee , and perhaps even the nominee himself , during the campaign . Otherwise , what explanation can there be for all of the investigative information \u2014 much of it classified , and thus illegal to disclose \u2014 that has been funneled to the press ?\nNow that they \u2019 ve been called on it , the media and Democrats are gradually retreating from the investigation they \u2019 ve been touting for months as the glue for their conspiracy theory .\nIn short , the media and Democrats have been playing with fire for months . The use of law-enforcement and national-security assets to investigate one \u2019 s political opponents during a heated election campaign has always been a potentially explosive story . Let \u2019 s not kid ourselves : If the roles were reversed , and a Republican administration had investigated officials tied to the campaign of the Democrats \u2019 nominee , we would be drowning in a sea of Watergate 2.0 coverage .\nWell , this weekend , the potentially explosive story detonated . It happened in the now familiar way : jaw-dropping tweets by President Trump .\nGiven the abundance of indications that the Obama Justice Department scrutinized his campaign , or at least his associates , it was odd that the president chose to tweet the one allegation in the whole mess that appears insupportable \u2014 viz. , that President Obama had had candidate Trump wiretapped . To my knowledge , no such suggestion has ever been publicly reported . At most , it has been reported ( but not proved ) that there was a FISA application in June that \u201c named Trump \u201d \u2013 but , as I \u2019 ve pointed out , saying someone was named in an application does not mean that person was targeted for eavesdropping . And , in any event , the reporting tells us that if there was such an application , the FISA court denied it . Thus , I know of no basis to believe that Trump himself was wiretapped ; and if the president \u2019 s objective was to sensationalize the story , it would surely have been enough to tweet out a colorable fear that surveillance of him \u2014 as a Russian agent \u2014 had been proposed .\nBut was the overstatement slyly intentional ? Was Trump trying to make a point ?\nMaybe not . It is certainly possible that the president was angry and the tweets result from a fit of pique . On the other hand , though , how much crazier is it for Trump to contend that Obama ordered spying on Trump than for the media and Democrats to have contended , for month upon month , that Trump \u2019 s campaign conspired with the Putin regime to steal the American presidential election and turn the Oval Office into occupied Kremlin territory ?\nIt is probable that both allegations are ludicrous . There is a good case , though , that there \u2019 s more support for the former than the latter .\nYou will hear more righteous indignation in the coming days , no doubt . The first brushback pitches came this weekend : the claim that if President Trump dares to demand that the FBI and Justice Department show him the supposed FISA applications , he will be engaged in unprecedented political interference in the independence of law enforcement . It \u2019 s a silly assertion ; as I explained over the weekend , FISA surveillance is not law enforcement , it is national security . A chief executive who demanded to review FISA information ( obtained by exercise of the executive \u2019 s power ) would be doing his main job \u2014 to protect the country \u2014 not interfering in a judicial proceeding .\nBut have you noticed ? While all this head-spinning legal jibber-jabber goes back and forth , the foundation of the false narrative we \u2019 ve been hearing since November 8 has vanished . Now that we \u2019 re supposed to believe there was no real investigation of Trump and his campaign , what else can we conclude but that there was no real evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia . . . which makes sense , since Russia did not actually hack the election , so the purported objective of the collusion never existed .",
