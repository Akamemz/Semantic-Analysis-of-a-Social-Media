    "content": "West Des Moines , Iowa ( CNN ) Donald Trump had every reason to feel optimistic Monday . His poll numbers were up ; he had secured two prominent endorsements in the space of a week ; and even the weather seemed to be cooperating , with a snowstorm coming in from the west expected to hold off until after midnight .\nAnd then , he lost , coming in second to Ted Cruz\nTrump spent January in full-on attack mode against Cruz . Trump questioned whether Cruz qualifies as a `` natural-born citizen '' eligible to serve as president . He went after the evangelical vote , winning the endorsement of Liberty University President Jerry Falwell , Jr. , but did n't back up the appeals with a ground game . And then he sat out the final debate , opting for a rally across town at the same time .\nHe acknowledged Tuesday that may have backfired . `` I think some people were disappointed that I did n't go into the debate , '' Trump said in New Hampshire .\nExit polls Monday showed that 55 % of voters who made up their minds in the final days went with Cruz or Rubio , while only 15 % of them chose Trump .\nTrump and his advisers do n't have too much time to figure out what went wrong . With Cruz 's win and Marco Rubio 's much stronger-than-expected finish Monday night , Trump now urgently confronts the danger of the Florida senator chipping away at his establishment backing in upcoming contests .\nThe second-place finish should serve as a serious reality check for his campaign , which is in large part based on bucking the traditional rules of campaigning and political engagement . Then again , nothing about Trump is conventional .\n`` People did n't talk about my second place , '' Trump said Tuesday night . `` They did n't talk about it as positively as they should have . ''\nThere was nothing traditional about Trump 's campaign style in Iowa .\nFrom Day One , Trump showed little interest in retail politics and the intimate settings that have come to define presidential politics in the Hawkeye State . Instead , the billionaire jetted in and out on his private 757 , trading in large rallies for town halls , taking a pass on the local delis and diners , and declining to sleep overnight in the state .\nThe Trump campaign remained tight-lipped about its efforts to get voters out , sharing little to nothing about its grassroots and volunteer efforts on the ground . The campaign swatted away reports of a lackluster ground game , insisting that its supporters in Iowa would turn out in the end because they were so eager to elect a non-traditional candidate like Trump .\nIt was only in the final stretch that Trump showed minimal interest in retail politics .\nHe began holding more than one event a day . In January , he made his first stop at a Pizza Ranch -- the famous restaurant chain that is a favorite among presidential candidates . Trump even slept at a Holiday Inn in one of his final weekends in the state .\nMeanwhile , Cruz 's campaign had been making inroads in Iowa in the old-fashioned way for months .\nThe Texas senator crisscrossed the state , ultimately completing the `` full Grassley '' by visiting all 99 counties in the state . His campaign developed a massive grassroots operation , that according to the campaign 12,000 volunteers fanned out cross the state knocking on doors and making phone calls . It also recruited dozens of pastors and county chairs .\nRubio , in the meantime , came on and surprised everyone at the end . After Thursday 's debate , there were rumblings of a Rubio rise , which were tamped down by the Des Moines Register poll released two days before the caucuses that showed the Florida senator in the mid-teens , far ahead of of the others in the establishment lane like Chris Christie and Jeb Bush , but still significantly behind Trump and Cruz .\nHundreds of Rubio volunteers made phone calls to undecided voters in the days leading up to the caucuses , according to campaign aides . During those calls , they found that a good number of Trump supporters -- some frustrated with the businessman 's decision to skip last week 's Fox debate -- were switching over to Rubio .\nTrump had an improbable run as the national front-runner for most of the summer and fall . Then , in December , he started to trail Cruz in Iowa for the first time . Up until that point , the two men had refused to attack one another , seeming to believe that voters would find a messy mud-wrestling match distasteful .\nBut at the first sign of losing ground to Cruz here , Trump swiftly reversed course .\nHe began to mercilessly attack Cruz , questioning his ability to serve as president because he was born in Canada . At every opportunity , Trump pointed out Cruz 's opposition to ethanol subsidies -- a huge vulnerability for the senator in a state where farming and agriculture are hugely influential .\nTrump also jabbed at Cruz 's anti-establishment credentials , wondering out loud why the senator had failed to disclose large loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank for his Senate campaign .\n`` The truth is , he 's a nasty guy , '' Trump said in an interview on ABC 's `` This Week .
