    "content": "The 40th Republican National Convention is now history , and political strategists and pundits are poring over the poll numbers to see whether Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are getting a post-convention bounce in what have been very closely divided polls .\nRomney 's convention managers made some correct and some interesting decisions . First , do n't relitigate 2008 , as some conservatives would love to do .\nRomney and Ryan both acknowledged the hopes for change motivating so many erstwhile Barack Obama voters . They looked back on his record in office more in sorrow than in anger .\nFormer Democratic Rep. Artur Davis eloquently described his own disenchantment with the president . You can see why they did n't want to air a minute of his talk on MSNBC . It would have undercut the cable channel 's relentless narrative that Republicans are racists .\nThere was a special callout to young voters , who went 66 to 32 percent for Obama last time , when Ryan talked of twenty-somethings in their childhood bedrooms , `` staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life . ''\nAnd there was a reach-out to the unquantifiable but undoubtedly large number of voters who feel that it would be a bad thing for Americans to be seen rejecting the first black president .\nThat 's the one reason I can think of for why the Romney people made the otherwise puzzling decision to put on Clint Eastwood at 10:00 Eastern , when the broadcast networks began their hour of coverage . It 's summed up in one sentence : `` And when somebody does not do the job , we got to let them go . ''\nThis was not as tightly scripted a convention as the George W. Bush or Bill Clinton conventions . Eastwood spoke without a teleprompter and so , very effectively , did Condoleezza Rice .\nIn back-to-back speeches , Ann Romney talked about `` love '' and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie said that respect was more important than love . That seemed dissonant .\nActually , the two themes are reconcilable . A leader acts out of love for the people but , as Machiavelli taught , prefers to be feared than loved .\nBut slicker convention management would have rewritten one of the texts . The Romney folks left interpretation to a mostly hostile press and , they hope , a more sympathetic public .\nI suspect the point was not to seem slick . Romney has a cool demeanor , and the convention was a device to humanize him .\nHe and his wife described their personal lives in ways that resemble those of almost everyone . The kids roughhousing , the misfortunes that come sooner or later : They may have more money , but their lives are like those of lots of people .\nThe testimony of fellow church members about the Romneys ' service and caring was genuinely moving , recounted by people who are the opposite of slick . The convention floor was almost silent as they spoke , and we 'll see them again in TV ads .\nThe point is that the Romneys contributed something that is in short supply even among the very rich : time .\nThe convention also addressed concerns that have undoubtedly surfaced in focus groups . Yes , the candidate is open to women taking a lead role , as they have on his staff .\nYes , the candidate did help create businesses that employ tens of thousands and provide goods and services that people found they needed . Yes , Republicans care about education , and education choice , so that disadvantaged children have a chance to move upward .\nComing off the convention floor , I heard raves about Romney 's speech from rank-and-file delegates and limited praise from those more experienced .
