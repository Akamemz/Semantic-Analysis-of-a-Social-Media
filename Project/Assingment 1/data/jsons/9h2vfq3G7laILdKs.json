    "content": "The unorthodox presidential campaign of Ben Carson took another twist late Wednesday when the retired neurosurgeon announced he would temporarily suspend his campaign . Unfortunately he \u2019 s not doing this for the usual reasons one suspends a campaign \u2013 cratering poll numbers , a juicy sexual-harassment scandal , a sudden onset of sanity . No , Carson will instead step off the trail to spend a couple of weeks on a book tour supporting `` A More Perfect Union , '' his just-released guide to interpreting the Constitution for people who think Ben Carson ever knows what he \u2019 s talking about .\nThe reaction on the right has been one of utter befuddlement . A candidate does not take time off from the Bataan Death March that is a modern presidential campaign just to read a few pages of his book to a bunch of elderly wingnuts in the back corner of the Hackensack Barnes and Noble . Especially not when he is in second place in the polls , nearly even with the frontrunner and far ahead of the rest of the pack . And he got there with hardly doing any traditional campaigning . Why stop now ?\nThe shock would be a lot easier to take seriously if a ) Ben Carson had not already shown himself to have a grasp of reality best described as \u201c tenuous \u201d and b ) if there was not a whole conservative ecosystem of publishers , TV and radio producers , think tanks , con artists and assorted other flimflammers all dedicated to making conservative politicians and media figures rich ( er ) through a combination of generous funding by wealthy benefactors and sucking money out of the pockets of rubes inclined to buy mail-order survival seeds as a hedge against the imminent Communist takeover of America , all because Fox News told them Obama is coming to steal their guns . It \u2019 s a perpetual motion machine of grift . Ben Carson is simply cashing in .\nHistorian Rick Perlstein traced the history of the right wing \u2019 s money-making cons in a 2012 essay in The Baffler . After describing the product pitches he was inundated with by conservative publications after he subscribed to their email lists , Perlstein said this :\n[ T ] his stuff is as important to understanding the conservative ascendancy as are the internecine organizational and ideological struggles that make up its official history\u2014if not , indeed , more so . The strategic alliance of snake-oil vendors and conservative true believers points up evidence of another successful long march , of tactics designed to corral fleeceable multitudes all in one place\u2014and the formation of a cast of mind that makes it hard for either them or us to discern where the ideological con ended and the money con began .\nOne need only look at the Republican candidates from the last two election cycles to see the cycle of grift at work . There was Ron Paul and his newsletters promising to show you how to put all your money in gold in advance of a worldwide economic collapse that never seems to arrive . ( But please don \u2019 t cancel that subscription ! ) There was Mike Huckabee , recently busted for hawking a cinnamon-based cure for diabetes to the elderly diabetes-prone conservative base , using his 2008 campaign to land a talk show on the Fox News channel .
