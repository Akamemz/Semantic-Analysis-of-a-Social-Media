    "content": "Defense Distributed ( DD ) is a small Texas company that has developed and published online digital files that may be used to make firearms either by 3D printing or computer controlled milling machines . It is the brainchild of self- described libertarian anarchist Cody Wilson .\nIn 2013 , DD uploaded software files for the 3D printing of the \u201c Liberator , \u201d a single shot pistol , and a lower receiver ( the part regulated by federal law ) of the much maligned AR-15 rifle . According to the Associated Press , the software was downloaded over 100,000 times in the first 24 hours . The downloads continued for days thereafter , and the software became ( and remains ) widely available on numerous free access websites . It was game , set , and match for Wilson and DD .\nNevertheless , within days of the initial online posting , the Obama Department of State ordered DD to cease making the software available online . Citing the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations , the State Department contended that this was necessary to protect national security by restricting the export of this \u201c military technology \u201d abroad . Given that DD \u2019 s software and similar digital offerings from other sources were already in the public domain and could not be retrieved , this directive was a meaningless gesture that presented no real burden or obstacle to DD .\nBut , for libertarian Wilson , it afforded a golden opportunity to twist the tail of big government , and twist away he did .\nDD filed suit in federal district court seeking a preliminary injunction against the Obama administration . DD \u2019 s clever and intriguing position was that , far from exporting firearms , it was distributing information in the form of software , and its sharing of that information was protected by the First Amendment . It argued that the State Department \u2019 s demand constituted an illegal prior restraint of constitutionally protected free expression .\nThe district court , citing the \u201c public \u2019 s keen interest in restricting the export of defense articles , \u201d declined to issue the preliminary injunction but did not dismiss DD \u2019 s lawsuit . Although the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court \u2019 s denial of the preliminary injunction , it noted in dicta that making or even printing a pistol or AR-15 lower \u201c is legal for United States citizens and will remain legal for United States citizens regardless of the outcome of this case. \u201d In other words , the court addressed only the need to prevent the exportation of the software and not the domestic use of the software to make firearms .\nIn July 2018 , DD and the Trump State Department settled the case . Under the terms of the settlement agreement , DD would be permitted to once again upload its software and the State Department would issue an opinion letter that the software is not subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations .\nThis caused eight Democrat state attorneys general to file suit in multiple federal district courts to block the settlement agreement and prohibit DD from again posting its software online . For them , exportation of the software abroad was not the issue . Instead , they sought to prevent online publication of the software to promote domestic public safety . For example , on July 29 , 2018 , Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro tweeted \u201c Tonight , I went to court to prohibit access to new 3D-printable guns in PA . These downloadable firearms were just about to be widely available online . It \u2019 s an existential threat to our state & we stepped in to stop it . The site is \u2013 & will remain \u2013 dark throughout PA . \u201d\nSimilarly , a federal judge in Washington state issued an injunction prohibiting DD from posting its software because \u201c the proliferation of these firearms will have many of the negative impacts on a state level that the federal government once feared on the international stage . \u201d\nSo , what has been accomplished ? Have we been saved from Attorney General Shapiro \u2019 s \u201c existential threat \u201d ? Hardly .\nPlacing all of this into context , the actions of the Obama State Department and the lawsuits by the Democrat attorneys general have merely demonstrated once again the utter futility of gun control . DD \u2019 s software is only the tiniest tip of the iceberg . Not only is it and other similar software already in the public domain and readily available for use by one and all , there is no way to recall it . That fight was over in 2013 .\nMoreover , individuals have been making their own firearms in this country since the founding of the Republic . Today it is possible to make high quality , fully functioning lower receivers for firearms such as AR-15s , AK-47s , and handguns using simple hand tools . As long as they are not sold to others , it is perfectly legal to make firearms with no serial numbers and no means of tracing them . This state of affairs exists because there is no way that the government could ever hope to effectively regulate or prevent such private manufacture of firearms that is ongoing in homes , garages , and machine shops across the nation .\nWhile DD sells a so-called Ghost Gunner computer-controlled milling machine that will speed up the process of making lower receivers for AR-15s and model 1911 pistols , the same job can be and has been done using hand tools such as routers , drill presses , and electric drills . The number of such privately made firearms is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands .\nBut the private manufacture of firearms is the least of the challenges facing gun control advocates .

Or they get them in back alleys or on street corners from other criminals . In many places , they can even rent a gun to pull a job or commit a murder . Neither restrictions on the ownership of guns nor their traceability through serial numbers are of concern to these predators .\nThe bottom line is this : there is and can be no such thing as effective gun control .
