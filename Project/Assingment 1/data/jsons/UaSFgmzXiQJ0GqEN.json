It forms part of a 10-year , $ 350 billion agreement in a \u201c strategic vision \u201d between the two countries , reports the Washington Post .\nThe deal had been in the works for some time , but the White House evidently pushed hard to finalize the deal in time to announce it during the president \u2019 s trip to Saudi Arabia . It was meant to send a clear message : Trump isn \u2019 t going to do things the way his predecessor did .\nBack in September , the Obama administration approved a more than $ 115 billion arms deal with the Saudis . But as the death toll and reports of human rights violations in the Saudi-led war on Yemen began to rise dramatically , the Obama administration nixed the sale of the precision-guided munitions it had originally agreed to put in the deal to try to coerce the Saudis into curbing those atrocities .\nNow those munitions are back in the Trump arms package \u2014 which speaks volumes about this administration .\nIn fact , the entire deal paints a vivid picture of the Trump administration \u2014 an administration that is willing to bend over backwards to make deals with important friends , that doesn \u2019 t let human rights concerns get in the way of doing business , and where personal relationships with those closest to the president can prove highly lucrative .\nJared Kushner had a personal hand in closing the deal\nJared Kushner , the president \u2019 s senior adviser and son-in-law , seems to have played a pivotal role in the deal , swooping in to personally help push the Saudis to finish the deal in time for Trump \u2019 s Saudi trip .\nAs the New York Times reports , most of the agreement was already in place when Kushner got involved . But during a final meeting , a US official brought up the possibility of adding a \u201c sophisticated radar system designed to shoot down ballistic missiles \u201d to the Saudis \u2019 shopping list . Iran , Saudi Arabia \u2019 s main adversary , has an excellent missile program , so the Saudis were naturally interested in that kind of system .\nThere was just one problem : the price tag . This is where Kushner comes in . Kushner evidently picked up the phone right there in the middle of the meeting and called Marillyn Hewson , the CEO of Lockheed Martin ( the company that makes the system ) , and straight-up asked her if she could give the Saudis a discount , the Times notes . Hewson apparently said she \u201c would look into it , \u201d according to the Times .\nThere are a few things to note from this vignette . First , it shows to what lengths this administration will go to make a deal when it really matters . And Saudi Arabia really , really matters . Trump wants ( and needs ) the country \u2019 s help to fight ISIS and the extremist ideology driving it .\nBut there \u2019 s another reason pleasing Saudi Arabia matters to Trump : Bloomberg reports that the kingdom is considering investing around $ 40 billion in US infrastructure . Trump wants to spend $ 1 trillion on improving American infrastructure , and the Saudi money would certainly help achieve that goal .\nSecond , the more libertarian-leaning members of the Republican party who have complained that many of Trump \u2019 s policy inclinations go against traditional conservative free-market principles now have yet another data point to make their case . After all , this is a clear example of the government directly interfering in the free market by trying to get a company to change its price on an item .\nEven worse , one of the president \u2019 s senior advisers purposefully fought to make a US company less money in order to help another country out . I very much doubt that \u2019 s what most Trump voters expected his \u201c America First \u201d policy to look like .\nFinally , the fact that Kushner himself was at the center of the whole thing is especially notable . Whereas foreign military sales in the past would be negotiated through multiple US government bureaucracies , countries can now apparently skip all that red tape and go right to the source as long as they forge a relationship with Kushner .\nAnd you better believe that other countries are paying attention to that .\nObama offered a big deal to the Saudis \u2014 but Trump gave the Saudis what they really wanted\nTrump hailed the deal as a victory , saying it \u201c was a great day \u201d because of \u201c tremendous investments in the United States . . . and jobs , jobs , jobs , \u201d reports the Washington Post .
