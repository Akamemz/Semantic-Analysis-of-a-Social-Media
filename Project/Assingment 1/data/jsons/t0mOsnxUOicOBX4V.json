My basic argument on this overall issue is that the right to vote is guaranteed to eligible US citizens . We 've made the decision that law-abiding 15-year-old citizens , for instance , are not yet ready to participate in the voting process ( despite having first amendment rights to political expression ) , and that non-citizens are not eligible ( though some leftists want to change this , too ) .

Having chosen to infringe upon or extinguish others ' rights -- to life , liberty and property , among others -- through their crimes , convicted felons are rightfully forced by the state to surrender many of their own former rights . Having broken our laws , they should not be able to participate in the process of shaping our laws while serving out their sentences . As a supporter of criminal justice reform , I 'm very open to the idea of restoring felons ' voting rights upon release , but Bernie 's plan is a far cry from that .

It 's wrong , and I suspect it 's also deeply unpopular .\nConvicted felons are treated as second class citizens , due to their own actions . These second class citizens , who 've harmed others , should not join regular citizens as we elect representatives to shape our laws , especially while they are still imprisoned for their crimes . That blanket policy should apply evenly to all incarcerated citizens , even though some felonies are obviously worse than others . That 's why sentences vary from offense to offense .
