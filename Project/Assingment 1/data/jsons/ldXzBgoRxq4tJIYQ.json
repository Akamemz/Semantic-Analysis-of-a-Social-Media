    "content": "( CNN ) Donald Trump 's latest crisis -- over his reported disclosure of highly classified information to Russia -- is giving voice to a question whispered privately in Washington during weeks of political turmoil : Is the President up to the job ?\n`` This is n't really about the power of the President . He has the power to do this , '' former CIA Director Michael Hayden said on `` CNN Tonight '' Monday . `` This is more about the person of the President and the performance . ''\nThe new storm engulfing an already beleaguered White House is so potentially damaging because it stretches far beyond the simple personal standing and reputation of the President .\nThe rumpus , first reported by The Washington Post , has national security , intelligence and international implications that White House attempts to knock down the story on Monday night conspicuously failed to address . It 's even possible that lives could be at risk , considering that the information Trump reportedly shared was related to an ISIS terror plot against civil aviation -- currently the most urgent terrorist threat to the United States -- and emanated from a sensitive intelligence sharing agreement with a foreign agency .\nOnce again , the credibility of the White House political operation and the efforts of its communications operation to keep up with an inexperienced President 's chaotic leadership style are on the line .\n`` We are seeing the results of him being a bit undisciplined , impulsive , instinctive and intuitive , little patience for preparation and little patience for process , '' said Hayden . `` When he goes off script like this ( it is ) ultimately destructive of his own purposes . '' `` We are seeing the results of him being a bit undisciplined , impulsive , instinctive and intuitive , little patience for preparation and little patience for process , '' said Hayden . `` When he goes off script like this ( it is ) ultimately destructive of his own purposes . ''\nThere are few commodities as important to presidents as a reputation for competence . Once public confidence in a commander-in-chief 's capacity to do his job wanes , their political decline can be brutally swift , as President George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter could attest .\nThat 's why this story may end up being so damaging to Trump .\nEarlier uproars that buffeted the White House , over the President 's inflammatory tweets and a litany of falsehoods over his inaugural crowd size , could be put down to Trump 's idiosyncratic freewheeling style . Critics saw his firing of FBI Director James Comey as evidence of more worrying autocratic instincts .\nJUST WATCHED Mudd blasts McMaster : Do n't play us for idiots Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mudd blasts McMaster : Do n't play us for idiots 01:19\nBut the report that Trump shared top secret information about an ISIS terror plot with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office last Wednesday -- the morning after the Comey firing -- poses a more searching question about whether the President can be trusted with the gravest responsibilities that come with his office and whether he understands the implications of discussing America 's most carefully guarded secrets with a US adversary .\nAs those questions rattled through Washington Monday night , the White House was in a bunker mentality . And even allies who have been supportive of the administration so far are now casting huge doubt on its credibility .\n`` They are in a downward spiral right now and have got to figure out a way to come to grips with all that 's happening , '' said Republican Sen. Bob Corker , who is viewed as a sober and restrained influencer on Capitol Hill .\n`` The chaos that is being created by the lack of discipline is creating an environment that I think \u2014 it creates a worrisome environment , '' Corker said .\nThere is not much doubt that of all the dramas that have battered this administration , the new Russia intelligence saga is the most dramatic .\nAlan Dershowitz , professor emeritus at Harvard University , said Trump is safe from criminal prosecution or impeachment because a President has the power to declassify intelligence .\nBut he offered a stunning assessment of the gravity of the situation .\n`` This is the most serious charge ever made against a sitting president of the United States . Let 's not underestimate it , '' he told CNN 's Erin Burnett .\nBut Trump hit back early Tuesday , implicitly dismissing arguments about his competence by arguing that he had made a strategic decision to share intelligence with his Oval Office guests .\n`` As President I wanted to share with Russia ( at an openly scheduled W.H . meeting ) which I have the absolute right to do , facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety . Humanitarian reasons , plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism , '' Trump wrote on Twitter .\nFormer CIA Director Leon Panetta , however , told CNN 's `` New Day '' that a lack of discipline by the President was causing him to make rash decisions .\n`` The President of the United States can not just do or say or speak whatever the hell he wants . That 's just irresponsible . So you need to have some people that sit down with the President before he goes into a meeting and say these are the lines you can not cross because it relates to the security of our country , '' Panetta said .\nThere have already been several reports that allied intelligence agencies , fearful of the administration 's capacity to guard the most sensitive secrets , have been wary about sharing top secret information with the United States .\nThe Washington Post said in its report , major details of which were confirmed by CNN , that Trump had told the Russians about information provided by a US partner agency in an intelligence-sharing agreement that was so sensitive details were withheld from allies and restricted even within the US government . The consequences of that could hardly be more serious , former CIA case officer Bob Baer told Burnett .\n`` The President , by revealing this to the Russians , has lost control of this information . It 's going to go to the Syrians , It 's going to go to the Iranians \u2014 Russian allies , '' Baer said .\n`` The ability to protect that source whoever he is , wherever he is has been seriously undermined ... If a CIA officer had revealed this information to the Russians , he would be fired instantly . ''\nThe White House on Monday blasted the reports as `` false . '' National Security Adviser H.R . McMaster said that Trump did not compromise any sources and methods .\nBut while the identity of the country that provided the US with the information is not publicly known , it is unlikely to be too hard for the Russians , with their highly sophisticated intelligence agencies , to work out where it came from . That leaves open the possibility that vital intelligence , key to protecting American lives , may not be available to US clandestine services in future .\nLawmakers and intelligence officials are already warning that disclosing this type of information could harm US efforts to counter an ISIS plot to place explosives in laptops and other electronic devices to evade airport security .\nJUST WATCHED Donald Trump on Clinton emails : Lies , lies , lies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Donald Trump on Clinton emails : Lies , lies , lies 01:37\nOne reason why Trump is so politically vulnerable to Monday 's reports is that he anchored much of his campaign on lambasting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified information .\nBut now he appears to have acted in way that is just as much , if not more , injurious to American secrets as Clinton 's private email scheme , exposing him to accusations of hypocrisy .\nRepublicans meanwhile are getting strung out by the constant chaos raging around the Trump presidency \u2014 and that they are constantly forced to address , to the detriment of their once-in-a-generation chance to use Republican majorities on Capitol Hill to enact a conservative agenda .\nRepublican Sen.
