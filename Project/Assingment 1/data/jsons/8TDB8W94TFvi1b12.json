    "content": "Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team are facing new complications in the final stretch of their investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election , as targets allegedly breach agreements and balk at plea deals .\nOn Monday , the Mueller team claimed that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort violated his plea deal by lying to the FBI and Mueller \u2019 s office on a \u201c variety of subject matters , \u201d amid reports the cooperation agreement was not panning out how prosecutors had hoped . Conservative author Jerome Corsi also plans to reject a potential deal with Mueller involving a perjury plea .

The president tweeted early Tuesday that the special counsel \u2019 s office is treating people \u201c viciously \u201d and \u201c ruining lives for them refusing to lie , \u201d an apparent reference to Corsi 's reported claims about why he wo n't strike a deal .\n\u201c Wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people , ruining lives for them refusing to lie .
