    "content": "NASHUA , N.H.\u2014Nothing was settled , but a few things were clearer after the big Republican cattle call here this weekend .\nThere \u2019 s no clear frontrunner . The fight for the nomination is unusually fluid . And while the Obama administration continues to be deeply loathed on the right , the GOP field is beginning to turn its attention to Hillary Clinton , the presumptive Democratic nominee .\nMost of the 700 activists who sat patiently through two days of speeches at the conference sponsored by the New Hampshire Republican Party came away impressed by at least a handful of the 19 potential candidates who spoke .\n\u201c This was the kickoff event , \u201d said Ovide LaMontagne , a former Republican gubernatorial nominee here . \u201c It \u2019 s sort of like the gun firing when the horses are going on the track , and now we \u2019 re off to the races . \u201d\nThese first impressions count . Many of the people in the audience will become key grassroots organizers in this first-in-the-nation primary state for whoever they eventually sign on with .\nThe New Jersey governor is down , but not out . He \u2019 s putting all his chips on winning the Granite State , and the positive reception he received here showed that it \u2019 s probably the best bet he can make with his limited options .\nThe town hall format that helped John McCain win the primary in 2000 and 2008 is Christie \u2019 s greatest strength , and he excelled in give-and-takes with voters around the state this week , including one with rowdy patrons at a bar Friday night .\nChristie said his son Patrick , 14 , has been teasing him over text message that New Hampshire is his \u201c new home state . \u201d\nChristie arrived with a plan for drastic Social Security reforms , including means testing and increasing the retirement age to 69 . It \u2019 s the kind of proposal that a top-tier candidate would never risk rolling out \u2014 and it would cause serious headaches in a general election \u2014 but Christie recognizes the state has a history of rewarding straight talk and gravitating to people willing to tell \u201c hard truths . \u201d\nAt the first major GOP event since Clinton became an official candidate , the candidates made a special effort to explain that they would measure up especially well against her .\nIn his last New Hampshire trip , Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker wore a sweater he said he bought at the Kohl \u2019 s discount store for $ 1 . This time , for a Saturday night dinner speech , he wore a suit he said that he got on sale at Jos . A . Bank . Walker told the crowd that Clinton has probably never been to a Kohl \u2019 s , and he wondered whether the former first lady has even gone shopping for herself in the past two decades . He argues his modest roots will make a great contrast to her status as a high-flying global celebrity .\nMike Huckabee , who will announce whether he \u2019 s running on May 5 , argued that he benefits from the unique experience of running \u201c against the Clinton political machine \u201d in Arkansas . \u201c I \u2019 ll show you some scars , because I \u2019 ve got quite a few , \u201d the former governor said .\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz said he \u2019 d be a good debater head-to-head with Clinton , especially about income inequality .\nJohn Bolton , the former United Nations ambassador , noted that Hillary and Bill were a year ahead of him at Yale Law School , which he thinks gives him credibility to talk about how \u201c radical \u201d she was back then .\nAs the only potential female candidate on the Republican side , former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina pegged her pitch explicitly to gender .\nA college student in the audience said other young women on her college campus \u201c blindly follow Hillary Clinton \u201d because she would shatter the ultimate glass ceiling . \u201c Well , \u201d Fiorina replied , \u201c wouldn \u2019 t it be good if we gave those young women a choice ? \u201d After entering and exiting the stage to Alicia Keys \u2019 `` Girl on Fire , '' Fiorina declared : \u201c I have a different voice and , oh , by the way , I look a little different too . \u201d\nA constant refrain during interviews with local party leaders \u2014 including those from the establishment wing of the party \u2014 is that the 2016 nominee should bring something new and dynamic to the table . The feeling grows out of the deeply-imbued sense that the country is on the wrong track .\nFor now , that mainly manifests itself in anxiety about the dynastic implications of nominating another Bush . \u201c We \u2019 re not talking about the Romanovs or the Windsors , \u201d said John Cebrowski , a former state legislator from Bedford . \u201c We need some freshness . \u201d\nMany of the candidates tried to seize on this . Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wore blue jeans and argued that he \u2019 s a new kind of candidate who can appeal to minorities and young people in a way that recent nominees have not . Asked what sets him apart from Jeb Bush , Walker said one of his assets is that he \u2019 s \u201c a fresh face \u201d who \u2019 s not of D.C .\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio said he understands the problems facing today \u2019 s generation because he \u2019 s part of it . He also poked fun at his relative youth . \u201c I was asked whether 43 is old enough to be elected president , \u201d he said . \u201c I said I wasn \u2019 t sure , but I know 44 is . \u201d\nBush , for his part , clearly realizes that this is not a next-in-line kind of election . The former Florida governor worked hard on this foray to exude humility . He distanced himself from his brother and father , insisting that he is his \u201c own man \u201d who will roll out his own ideas . He declined to critique George W. Bush \u2019 s foreign policy during one of his press gaggles on the grounds that it would require him to look backward when he was focused on the future . He also repeatedly invoked the birth this week of his fourth grandson .\nWith a pervasive sense that the world is in crisis \u2014 and with a rebounding economy making domestic issues less salient \u2014 a large share of the stump speeches and questions which followed focused on the Middle East .\nThe candidates \u2014 with the exception of Paul \u2014 were trying to one up each other when it came to the question of who would take the hardest line against Iran .\nRubio invoked his seats on the Senate foreign affairs and intelligence committees to warn that the Islamic regime is on track to have the capability to fire rockets at the East Coast of the U.S. within a decade , that a military attack on Iran might be better than allowing them to acquire a nuclear weapon and that it \u2019 s only a matter of time before there \u2019 s another big terror attack on American soil .\nHuckabee said Iran is a viper and suggested that the country of 81 million could be treated accordingly . \u201c You don \u2019 t try to reason with a snake . \u2026 You don \u2019 t pet the snake . \u2026 You don \u2019 t try to have a conversation with the snake , \u201d he said . \u201c You get a .410 shotgun or a shovel or a hoe , and you take the snake \u2019 s head off before he bites you . \u201d\nLouisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal also said he \u2019 s open to a military solution .\nThree dark-horse candidates \u2014 Bolton , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and New York Rep. Pete King \u2014 signaled that national security is central to their rationale for wanting to get in .\nPaul , who has expressed skepticism of the Iran deal but not decried it out of hand , set himself apart from the pack . Sensing overreach , he ripped into his hawkish rivals for being too quick to want to use the military .\nCommon Core is toxic with the GOP base \u2014 and Jeb Bush finally realizes it .\nThere were as many questions about Common Core as any other domestic issue this weekend . The Republican field responded accordingly .\n\u201c Common Core is every bit as problematic as Obamacare , \u201d said former Texas Gov . Rick Perry .\n\u201c We need to repeal every word of Common Core , \u201d said Cruz , generating maybe the loudest cheers of his speech .\n\u201c A lot of politicians say they \u2019 re against Common Core , \u201d said Jindal . \u201c I \u2019 m actually in federal court right now suing President Obama and suing Arne Duncan\u2026to stop it. \u201d Several people in the audience whistled .\nLike most Republican governors , including Walker , Jindal has changed his position . Christie acknowledged that he implemented Common Core but blamed it on his Democratic predecessor and said he \u2019 s awaiting imminent recommendations from a committee he created about how best to change it .\nBush was one of the biggest cheerleaders for Common Core until he got into the presidential race . Since calling the debate over the standards in math and English language arts \u201c troubling \u201d last November , he has changed his tone . \u201c We don \u2019 t need a federal government involved in this at all , \u201d he said Friday when asked about the matter . Now he pronounces supports for a bill that would prevent the federal government from setting curriculum standards .\nThe governors in the race will portray the senators as Obama-esque .\nThe first three Republicans to formally announce for president are senators who have served less than a full term \u2013 just like Obama before his 2008 victory .
