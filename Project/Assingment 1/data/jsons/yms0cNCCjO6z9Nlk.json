Bravery can be foolhardy as well as exemplary . The word is especially ambiguous in a sport as tawdry , crooked and harmful as professional boxing was then and still is . Perhaps there were moments in Ali \u2019 s life when he was less than great . But it is hard to think of a moment when he was ever less than brave .\nHe was certainly extraordinarily brave in the ring . When he first became world heavyweight champion , he was cocky Cassius Clay , the Louisville Lip , a slim ex-light-heavyweight whose encounter with the reigning champion Sonny Liston in 1964 looked to many like a match of a bumptious boy against a murderous man . But Clay refused to walk into Liston \u2019 s trademark piledriving hooks . Instead he danced , taunted , confused and exhausted one of sport \u2019 s most chilling figures with his jabs . After six rounds , Liston was completely spent .\nTen years later , when Ali regained the title in Kinshasa , the bravery in the ring was , if anything , greater . The George Foreman of 1974 was not the gracious elder statesman he has now become and was again on the news of Ali \u2019 s death . He was the most brutal puncher to hold the title since Liston . But Ali was brave enough to get into the ring with a plan . His rope-a-dope defensive tactics in Zaire \u2013 Ali called it a \u201c real thinkin \u2019 fight \u201d \u2013 have gone into sports history . And if a punch to a man \u2019 s head can ever be beautiful , then the one with which he knocked out Foreman , with Ali seemingly pausing to admire the succinctness of a blow that would guarantee his legend for evermore , perhaps deserves that description .\nYet if Ali was conspicuously brave in the ring , this was transcended by the political bravery which made millions the world over , black people above all , see him as a unique hero . Ali became champion at the height of the civil rights era . Unlike so many other top black fighters , he never hesitated to identify with that epic struggle . That in itself took courage . Many whites hated him for it . But his refusal to fight in Vietnam went further still , fusing the fight against the two great crimes of 1960s America . Young black men were being disproportionately drafted to fight in Vietnam . Ali \u2019 s refusal , eloquently expressed as ever , was an explosive act of defiance . For such a man to make that stand on that issue in that place at that time was an act of real heroism . It is why , above all , he means so much .\nPerhaps , though , Ali \u2019 s greatest act of personal bravery was still to come . When he contracted Parkinson \u2019 s disease , he never hid the fact . Ali certainly knew , and perhaps we also knew too , that he was paying the bodily price for his and the world \u2019 s overeager embrace of his earlier triumphs in the ring .
