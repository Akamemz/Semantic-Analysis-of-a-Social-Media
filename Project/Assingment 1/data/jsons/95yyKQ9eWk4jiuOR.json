Communism and fascism received 7 percent support each .\nMarion Smith , executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation , said the report shows millennials are \u201c increasingly turning away from capitalism and toward socialism and even communism as a viable alternative . \u201d\n\u201c This troubling turn highlights widespread historical illiteracy in American society regarding socialism and the systemic failure of our education system to teach students about the genocide , destruction , and misery caused by communism since the Bolshevik Revolution one hundred years ago , \u201d Mr. Smith said in a statement .\nMillennials are more likely to prefer socialism and communism than the rest of the country . Fifty-nine percent of all respondents chose capitalism as their preferred arrangement , compared to 34 percent who said socialism , 4 percent fascism and 3 percent communism .\nSome of communism \u2019 s luminaries are admired by millennials . Thirty-one percent said they have a favorable view of Che Guevara , 32 percent Karl Marx , 23 percent Vladimir Lenin and 19 percent Mao Zedong . Joseph Stalin is viewed favorably by just 6 percent .\nIn the poll , only 33 percent of millennials were able to identify the correct definition of socialism . They fared about as well as the rest of the country , which only successfully identified socialism at a 34 percent clip . Gen Z , the generation after millennials , \u2015was the most informed group , with 43 percent correctly identifying socialism .\nWhere millennials struggled compared to other generations was in the identification of capitalism . Just 51 percent correctly said capitalism is the \u201c economic system based on free markets and the rule of law with legal protections for private ownership. \u201d That was by far the lowest of any age cohort . Americans as a whole correctly identified capitalism 67 percent of the time .\nMillennials are also less likely to have a negative view of communism . Just 36 percent said they had a \u201c very unfavorable \u201d impression of the system , and only 44 percent said they would be insulted if described as a communist .\nAs a whole , 56 percent of Americans view communism very unfavorably , and 63 percent would be insulted to be associated with the ideology .\nOne possible explanation for the millennial infatuation with socialism is that 53 percent of the cohort reports feeling burdened by the economy .\nMillennials were the only age group more likely to say America \u2019 s economic system \u201c works against me \u201d rather than \u201c works for me. \u201d Gen Z had the most positive impression of the economy , with 66 percent saying it \u201c works for me , \u201d although many of them have yet to enter the workforce .\nThe Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation survey was conducted online from Sept. 28 to Oct. 5 by YouGov .
