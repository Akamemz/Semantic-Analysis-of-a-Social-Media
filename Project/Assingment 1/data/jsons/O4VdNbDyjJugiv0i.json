    "content": "Over at Talking Points Memo , Brian Beutler is torn up over the willingness of the Senate to pass a waiver to sequestration rules for the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .\nLate last night it took a break from its regular schedule of lacking 60 votes to shampoo the chamber carpet and unanimously passed a bill that will provide the FAA unique flexibility under sequestration \u2014 and thus halt the furloughs that have been causing travel delays around the country . Today the House will follow suit , and the White House has made it clear President Obama intends to sign it . Great if you fly . Bad , bad news if you 're on head start or rely on meals on wheels or otherwise are n't a Priority Pass holder . Aside the obvious iniquity , this is a big error . The point of sequestration is supposedly to create just enough chaos that regular people \u2014 people with political clout , such as , say , business travelers \u2014 demand that Congress fix it . Or as the Democrats conceived it , to create the public pressure they need to knock Republicans off their absolutist position on taxes .\nHaving apparently missed out on the decades-old deregulation of airline-ticket pricing , Beutler implicitly equates the mundane act of flying with , I do n't know , wearing monocles , lighting cigars with $ 100 bills , and other excresences of capitalism only available to the super-rich . This , despite the fact that over 80 percent of Americans have flown .\nThe original point of sequestration , or automatic , across-the-board cuts urged by Barack Obama , was to provide a spur to force Congress to come up with a specific ( yet tiny ) level of spending cuts that were agreed to as part of a barely remembered debt-limit deal . When that did n't happen\u2014despite plenty of time and delays\u2014the result is that around 1 percent to 2 percent of total federal spending is being trimmed in fiscal 2013 . But do n't worry : The feds are on track to spend more this year than last year even when you factor in sequestration . And for all the fretting over minor spending trims that are routinely described as barbaric and brutal and unconscionable , the long list of programs exempted from sequestration ensures that nobody is going to go hungry or naked due to cuts amounting to around $ 44 billion in this fiscal year . Sadly , that statement is also true for the Department of Defense and its contractors , who are taking the single-biggest hit but still doing quite fine .\nSo it turns out that the FAA has enough money in its cut-to-the-bone budget to keep planes flying as if nothing happened\u2014all it has to do is shift dollars from a useless activity to one that actually has an impact . The ease with which the FAA apparently can do that underscores the real fear of sequestration opponents : People will realize that a federal budget of around $ 3.6 trillion\u2014or roughly double the amount that was spent in nominal dollars the last year Bill Clinton was in office ( and 50 percent more in constant 2012 dollars ) \u2014is plenty big enough to cover all core government functions even if you think the government should do just about everything .\nAnd in case you 're wondering , air traffic control is not a core government function . Back in 2009 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Bob Poole explained how the FAA is using ridiculously outmoded technology to direct flights , even as Canada has fully demonstrated that spinning off that function to the airlines is better and more efficient .
