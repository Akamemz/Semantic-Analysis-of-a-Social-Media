Save for the energy he gave it at key moments , it was pedestrian .\nIt was important because with it , Obama returned in earnest to the work of governing .

That version of our president may have had more poetry about him . But this version wants to actually get down to governing .\nWhether he can or not remains to be seen . Indeed , it seems certain that many , if not most , of the goals he set on Tuesday night will elude him . But the speech was also important because it sent several clear messages to his fellow politicians .\nHe said , `` I won . I am in charge . I will not shy away from a progressive agenda . ''\nHe said , `` I know what I want . I 'm not afraid of defeat as I was in the past . I will never run in another political campaign again . ''\nOh , he did n't say these things literally . You wo n't find those words in the transcript . But look at the tape -- you 'll find them in his body language and between the lines of his speech .\nThe economy was his centerpiece -- but it was not just another campaign speech about growth . It was a speech about , as one of his team put it earlier in the day , `` growing the economy from the middle out . '' He spoke about restoring the middle class and creating opportunity . From the beginning it was clear that this was no longer a speech about recovering from a crisis . It was not another speech about America at war . Obama 's concern -- the crisis he was addressing -- was that incomes and job creation are stagnant even as the economy grows and corporate profits hit record levels .\nHis prescription was clear . We must invest in America and in its people . In infrastructure , domestic energy resources , cleaner energy and energy efficiency , education , research and building the workforce through immigration reform . Obama called for raising the minimum wage to help lift up the poorest and better reward those among them who are willing to work for a living . He also sounded the theme that we must do all these things to better compete in the global economy , citing the examples of China , Germany and others whose examples he said we should heed and exceed .\nEven the portion of his speech that dealt with foreign policy was oriented to the domestic economy . Yes , he began with the newsworthy announcement that he would bring home half of all troops in Afghanistan by next year and end our war there the following year . Yes , he talked about defeating al Qaeda even as it shape-shifted its way around the world . And he addressed drone oversight , North Korea 's nuclear test , Iran 's nuclear program and the Middle East .\nBut many of his statements on these issues were formulaic . And the thrust of all of them -- even the boldest , like his return to his Prague promise of working to reduce nuclear stockpiles -- was enabling America to focus more energy on rebuilding its strength at home . Furthermore , perhaps the most important international thrusts had nothing to do with war at all .
