    "content": "Two Americas began watching two very different sets of hearings on Wednesday . In one , President Donald Trump is guilty of abusing power in many ways and on many occasions , and one such occasion is being dissected and laid out in great detail on national television . In the other America and the other set of hearings , Democrats are out to get Trump at any cost , have latched onto a muddled and inconsequential incident , and are laying it out in great detail on national television in the hopes of convincing the public that the President has done something wrong . These two realities do not overlap .\nThe first reality is summed up in the opening statement by Adam Schiff , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , who said , \u201c The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally \u2019 s [ Ukraine \u2019 s ] vulnerability and invite Ukraine \u2019 s interference in our elections . Whether President Trump sought to condition official acts , such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance , on Ukraine \u2019 s willingness to assist with two political investigations that would help his re\u00eblection campaign . And if President Trump did either , whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the Presidency . \u201d\nThe second reality is presented in an eighteen-page memo prepared for House Republicans in advance of the hearings .

It notes that Ukraine is a corrupt country , that Trump was wary of shouldering the burden of supporting it , and that there is no direct evidence that aid was held up pending the investigation\u2014after all , in the end , the aid was released . According to the memo , Democrats have made a mountain out of the Ukraine molehill in order to get to Trump .
