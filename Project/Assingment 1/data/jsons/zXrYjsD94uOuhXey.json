One of the primary reasons all agree the claim is false is that no long-term studies have been conducted on children who have had their normal puberty suppressed with drugs .\nIdaho-based endocrinologist Dr. William Malone told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in November puberty suppression is \u201c frequently called reversible , but it \u2019 s not . \u201d\nNormal bone density development is interfered with and probably brain development too . Almost all children placed on puberty blockers go on to cross-sex hormones\u2014meaning puberty blockers solidify and sometimes intensify dysphoria .

In no other area of medicine would a medical society be so cavalier about treatments with unknown consequences . Caution is the rule in such situations , and always has been .

There is no scientific justification for departing from that established standard to the current affirmation-based approach .\nDr. Michelle Cretella , executive director of the American College of Pediatricians , said emphatically the Pediatric Endocrine Society \u2019 s claim that puberty suppressors are a \u201c reversible treatment \u201d is \u201c a bald-faced lie . \u201d\n\u201c There are no long-term studies of puberty blocker use for gender incongruence in children , \u201d Cretella explained to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Ergo , no one can say blockers are completely reversible and without harm . \u201d\nCretella pointed to documentation , however , by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) that links \u201c harm , \u201d i.e. , thousands of deaths , to Lupron , a drug prescribed with FDA approval for several conditions , including prostate cancer and endometriosis .\nNevertheless , Lupron is also being used , without FDA approval , as a puberty blocker on children and adolescents with gender dysphoria .\nPuberty blockers , like Lupron , effectively \u201c castrate \u201d children of both sexes at the level of the pituitary gland in the brain , chemically turning boys into eunuchs and sending girls into a pre-teen menopause . This is why many girls treated for FDA-approved conditions with Lupron have developed osteoporosis in their twenties . Puberty blocking prevents the normal maturation of all organs \u2013 including the brain \u2013 that depend upon the child \u2019 s natural sex hormones to develop . Adults treated with Lupron for FDA-approved conditions experience memory deficits . What are we doing to the brains of gender incongruent but physically healthy children ?\nThe pediatrician emphasized the \u201c harm \u201d caused by professionals urging transition affirmation .\n\u201c They are absolutely harming kids with blockers because they rob them of the very developmental period during which the vast majority come to embrace their biologic sex , \u201d Cretella stressed . \u201c Even if a child comes off blockers , we can never give back the period of normal physical/psychosocial development that was stolen from them . \u201d\nCalifornia-based endocrinologist Dr. Michael Laidlaw testified in support of the South Dakota bill , HB1057 , a measure that is seeking to protect children who are confused about their identity from harmful drugs , such as puberty blockers , surgeries and treatments .\nInstead of affirming the premise , as WaPo appeared to do , that gender confused children need puberty blockers to \u201c lower their risk for developing mental health conditions , \u201d Laidlaw asserted a high proportion of adolescents with gender confusion already had other psychological problems prior to the appearance of gender issues .\nA study from Finland , he noted , showed 75 percent of gender confused children \u201c had been or were currently undergoing psychiatric treatment for reasons other than gender confusion . \u201d\nLaidlaw observed another study that found \u201c 26 percent had autistic spectrum disorder \u201d and 68 percent had an initial contact with mental health services because of reasons other than gender confusion .\nIn 2018 , Dr. Lisa Littman set out to understand why the number of young girls identifying as transgender at Britain \u2019 s Gender Identity Development Service had increased from 41 percent in 2009 to 69 percent in 2017 .\nLittman found 62.5 percent of the girls whose parents participated in the study had been diagnosed with at least one mental health disorder prior to the onset of their gender confusion . For example , nearly half of the children had already attempted to harm themselves or had experienced a trauma .\nParental responses showed 87 percent of the teens announced they were transgender after increased time on social media and/or after \u201c cluster outbreaks \u201d of gender dysphoria in their groups of friends . Responses indicated most children who \u201c came out \u201d as transgender became increasingly popular as a result of their announcement .\n\u201c Peer contagion has been associated with depressive symptoms , disordered eating , aggression , bullying , and drug use , \u201d Littman observed .\nAttorney and researcher Jane Robbins recently examined at Townhall the relationship between the transgender industry and medical associations , such as the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and the Endocrine Society .\nRobbins noted AAP has partnered with the radical Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) \u2014 known for its bullying and coercive attacks in order to force acceptance of the LGBTQ lifestyle in public places , including schools .\n\u201c But do the views of HRC and AAP leadership align with those of AAP \u2019 s over 65,000 physician members ? \u201d Robbins asked . \u201c We don \u2019 t know , because the pro-experimentation policies were passed without input from those members . \u201d\nShe explained that AAP \u2019 s positions statements are drafted by a small committee and then voted on by a board of directors consisting of about a dozen members .\n\u201c The broader membership has no direct input into the statement and would generally learn of it only after it \u2019 s issued , \u201d Robbins said . \u201c So , the only thing the AAP policy tells us is that less than 0.05 percent of the pediatricians who are still members of AAP believe in experimenting medically on gender-confused children . \u201d\nIn September 2018 , Dr. Susan Bradley , a child psychiatrist who founded the Toronto Gender Identity Clinic , told National Review she is \u201c deeply concerned that AAP \u2019 s guidance has gotten so far ahead of the current knowledge base about gender dysphoric children . \u201d\nWe know from multiple studies that around 80 percent of gender dysphoric children will desist from their cross-sex identification in childhood to identify with their natal sex . Most of these will grow up to be gay or lesbian ; a substantial minority have also been diagnosed with autism . Yet the AAP guidance incorrectly dismisses these studies as flawed and outdated . There is no professional consensus on medical treatment of gender-dysphoric children and young adolescents .\nSimilarly , Robbins noted the Endocrine Society , which approves of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for gender-confused children , admits that 68 percent of its transgender guidelines are of \u201c very low \u201d or \u201c low \u201d quality .\n\u201c In fact , none are supported by high-quality evidence , \u201d she observed . \u201c The Society thus admits the scientific evidence for its recommendations is weak at best .
