Mike Gilday told reporters at the Pentagon Friday , noting the additional military units being sent into the region matched exactly what Central Command officials had asked for .\nBut administration critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere urged Mr. Trump to reconsider the move , over doubts about the quality of U.S. intelligence and fears of a re-run of the case made in the run-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion .\n\u201c This escalation doesn \u2019 t get us out of our decades long , seemingly endless wars , Mr. President , \u201d Sen.
