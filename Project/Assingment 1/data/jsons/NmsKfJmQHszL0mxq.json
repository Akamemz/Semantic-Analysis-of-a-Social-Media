    "content": "The next president will appoint at least one and perhaps as many as three Supreme Court justices , who in turn will have a decisive impact on the Court 's jurisprudence for decades . But last night 's presidential debate revealed that neither of the major-party candidates understands what Supreme Court justices are supposed to do .\nModerator Chris Wallace started the discussion off on the wrong foot by asking the candidates where they `` want to see the Court take the country , '' implying that justices are legislators in black robes , pursuing a policy agenda instead of deciding the controversies that come before them . Both candidates seemed to agree with that premise .\nDonald Trump promised that `` the justices that I 'm going to appoint will be pro-life '' and will therefore vote to overturn Roe v. Wade , the 1973 ruling that discovered a right to abortion in the 14th Amendment 's Due Process Clause . There are good reasons to think Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided , or at least that its constitutional rationale left much to be desired . But a justice 's personal views on abortion are logically and legally distinct from the issue of Roe 's soundness . A conscientious justice strives to separate his policy preferences from the question of what the Constitution allows or requires .\nEven if you think abortion should be banned , it does not necessarily follow that the Constitution allows states to ban it . And even if you think abortion should be legal , it does not necessarily follow that the Constitution prohibits states from banning it . A justice who ignores these distinctions is writing law instead of applying it .\nHillary Clinton also promised to appoint justices who will help her achieve the policies she favors , which include speech restrictions that protect politicians like her from criticism close to an election . Clinton said her Supreme Court picks `` will stand up and say no to Citizens United , a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark , unaccountable money to come into our electoral system . ''\nClinton neglected to mention , as she always does when discussing Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , that the case involved a movie that made her look bad . The Court concluded that a conservative group organized as a nonprofit corporation had a First Amendment right to present Hillary : The Movie on pay-per-view TV while Clinton was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 . Presumably Clinton disagrees . But instead of explaining why , she says the decision should be overturned because `` it permits dark , unaccountable money to come into our electoral system . '' Clinton worries that these dastardly dollars are `` drowning out the voices of ordinary Americans and distorting our democracy . '' But that is not a constitutional argument . Even if Clinton were right about the baleful impact of Citizens United , it would not follow that the First Amendment permits the sort of self-serving censorship she favors .\nIn addition to promising Supreme Court justices who agree with her that suppressing Hillary : The Movie was consistent with freedom of speech , Clinton said her picks would `` stand on the side of the American people , not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy . '' That sounds like she thinks the Court should be biased against big businesses and rich people , a position that can not be reconciled with the constitution or the statutes that the justices are charged with interpreting and applying . The law is supposed to provide equal protection to all Americans , regardless of their income or wealth .\nClinton is also wrong when she says `` the Supreme Court should represent all of us . '' That is what a democratically elected legislature is supposed to do . A court is supposed to apply the law , a function that does not cater to constituencies or dole out favors based on political considerations .\nIn light of that role , Chris Wallace 's other question about the Supreme Court was more apposite : `` What 's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted ? Do the founders ' words mean what they say , or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances ? ''\nClinton did not even attempt an answer , while Trump at least tried to mouth the words that somebody told him conservatives expect to hear from a Republican presidential nominee :\nThe justices that I am going to appoint\u2026will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted\u2026.I do n't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear . It 's all about the Constitution\u2026the way it was meant to be .\nIt 's not completely clear how that would work in practice , since we ca n't actually read the Framers ' minds . But Trump 's description seems consistent with interpreting constitutional provisions based on the original public understanding of them , the approach favored by Justice Clarence Thomas . An originalist approach rejects the idea that the Constitution is `` a living document '' in the sense that its meaning changes over time\u2014so that , for example , the 14th Amendment 's guarantee of due process can stop states from banning abortion , even if that is not the way the provision was understood when it was approved .\nWhile the latter approach can produce liberty-friendly results , it does so at the cost of loosening the Constitution 's constraints on goverment power , a tendency that is decidedly unfriendly to liberty . Hence it would be encouraging to hear a major-party candidate endorse originalism\u2014if we had any \u2588\u2588\u2588 to think he understood its value or would make decisions based on that understanding . It 's hard to believe that 's true of Trump , who thinks the Constitution has 12 articles , empowers judges to sign bills , authorizes presidents to rewrite libel law , and allows the government to take away the citizenship of people born in the United States . Trump claims he has read the Constitution , but if so he did not retain much .\nMeanwhile , in areas such as freedom of speech , gun control , surveillance , executive power , and federal authority , Clinton takes positions that are plainly inconsistent with the Constitution . That means voters who assume they have to choose between the two major parties will be choosing between a candidate who does n't know what the Constitution says and a candidate who does n't care .",
