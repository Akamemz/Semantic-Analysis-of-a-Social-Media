    "content": "Turn on the TV at almost any moment and you will hear anti-Trump rantings indistinguishable from the lamest claims made during the primaries . The conversation , if one can call it that ( it is more like the prosecution \u2019 s monologue at a show trial ) , hasn \u2019 t even moved beyond the sputtering that \u201c Trump didn \u2019 t enter the race to win \u201d and that \u201c greed \u201d explained his interest in the presidency . MSNBC \u2019 s Joe Scarborough , whose maturity level is roughly that of a high school cheerleader , asserts that Trump saw the presidency as a get-rich scheme and the media \u2019 s latest heavy-breathing Russian innuendo proves it .\nNo , what it proves is the media \u2019 s pathological commitment to its collusion fable . They put it on pause in the last couple of weeks but only so that they could dedicate all their energies to portraying Trump as a defender of Nazis and racists . Having wearied of that lie , they now turn back to the Russian libel . The wild claims of a bumptious Russian felon \u201c linked \u201d ( always a good word if you want to smear an opponent ) to Trump \u201c associates \u201d ( another laughably imprecise term favored by the anti-Trump media ) have generated a new spate of front-page stories .\nAny fair reader , if he managed to get to the end of these tortured stories , would ask : Who cares ? It is like the endless stories on Carter Page , a campaign volunteer for crying out loud , and what he may or may not have done , who he may or may not have met , where he may or may not have traveled . There is no reason , other than partisan spite , for the media \u2019 s obsessive interest in such minor figures .\nAny stick will do-that is the media \u2019 s essential publication policy on all things Trump . Myth , as the poets say , is a lie grown old . In that sense , anti-Trump journalists are mythmakers , hoping to publish lies frequently enough that they attach themselves to Trump by sheer repetition .\nThey know perfectly well that Trump didn \u2019 t collude with Putin to defeat Hillary . But they would be happy if that myth settled in the minds of Americans . Similarly , they seek to inculcate in Americans that Trump is a racist \u2014 a task that began in the first days of his campaign when they deliberately misrepresented his comments about illegal immigrants .\nThe willfulness of it all is grimly comic , a willfulness perfectly captured by MSNBC interrupting a Trump speech to instruct viewers solemnly that the president is now \u201c lying to you . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s depressing , though not surprising , is the role that rattled or envious Republicans have played in the construction of anti-Trump myths . Trump can \u2019 t even receive fair characterizations of his statements by members of his own staff . Trump explicitly and repeatedly condemned racists , neo-Nazis , and white nationalists , yet Gary Cohn gives an interview that never once references those statements while reinforcing the libel that Trump drew moral equivalence between racists and non-racists .\nNothing pleases journalists more than when Republicans do their propagandistic work for them .
