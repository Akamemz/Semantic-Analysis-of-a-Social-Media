    "content_original": "Experts say there will likely be some harm to U.S. intelligence efforts. Leaks fallout: How bad could it be?\n\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper claims the recent wave of leaks has done \u201chuge, grave damage\u201d to our intelligence gathering capabilities.\n\nNonsense, says Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who served as the primary conduit for the leaks: \u201cThere\u2019s not a single revelation that we\u2019ve provided to the world that even remotely jeopardizes national security.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSomewhere in between those two takes lies the truth.\n\nIntelligence experts and former officials interviewed by POLITICO say there will likely be some harm to U.S. intelligence efforts \u2014 though not in exactly the way many Americans might expect and not because the stories really revealed the crown jewels of American counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 10 things to know about Edward Snowden)\n\nAnd the surest negative impact of the disclosures is more likely to fall on the U.S. Internet industry, as some of its international customer base flees in search of sites thought to be more secure from American government snooping.\n\nFormer officials say it\u2019s not so much the specifics of what was leaked as the huge wave of publicity the leaks generated: Every news story could serve as a revelation to some terrorists, and a reminder to others, of the nation\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of Darwinian,\u201d former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden said. \u201cThe more stuff like this is in the public domain, we\u2019ll still catch terrorists, but it will be the stupid terrorists. \u2026 The guys we should really be worried about will be far less likely to be swept up in this effort.\u201d\n\n( WATCH: NSA reactions in under 60 seconds)\n\nWhile many Americans view terrorists as careful and well-informed, ex-intelligence officials say that in reality, their skill sets run the gamut \u2014 and the biggest terror threat in the United States right now actually seems to be homegrown extremists who are not hardened operatives and who lack first-rate tradecraft.
