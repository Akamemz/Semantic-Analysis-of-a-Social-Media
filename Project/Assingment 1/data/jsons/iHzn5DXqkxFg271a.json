    "content": "Obama Got The Convention Bounce , As Well As Bad Economic Numbers\nThe Democrats were no sooner out of Charlotte when the bad economic news came .\nA more disappointing job report than had been forecast . Economic numbers weaker than expected . Just 96,000 jobs were created in August , far fewer than what economists were anticipating . And even a lower unemployment rate \u2014 down to 8.1 percent from 8.3 \u2014 was explained as that more people had simply stopped looking for work . The hope of four years ago is quickly becoming a fading memory , especially for those whose lives have not seen the change Barack Obama once promised .\nReality often can get in the way of a celebration , and that may be how we define the convention bounce of 2012 . All the emotion and enthusiasm and memorable speeches of Charlotte have indeed resulted in a `` bounce '' for the president and his party . But how long does it last ? Maybe a little trip down memory lane is in order .\n`` Poor George , '' Ann Richards said of the Republican nominee . `` He ca n't help it . He was born with a silver foot in his mouth . ''\nThat 1988 Democratic convention also included taunts from Ted Kennedy aimed at Vice President George H.W . Bush , whom he was depicting as someone totally missing from accountability in the Reagan administration . `` Where was George ? '' he asked over and over , which became a rallying refrain at the Omni in Atlanta .\nAll in all , a big success for the Democrats and Michael Dukakis , who left the convention with a seven-point bounce and a 17-point lead in the polls , according to Gallup .\nBut the bounce the Democrats got did n't last long . Where was George , you ask ? Four weeks after their convention ended , Gallup had Bush up by nine .\nNot every convention bounce disappears . Bill Clinton got a 16-point bounce after his 1992 convention . Five weeks later , the Republicans met and renominated President Bush . But the GOP convention , its internal divisions exposed , was n't as successful , and Clinton never lost his momentum .\nTo be sure , things were different back then . The two conventions were weeks apart , and that allowed at least one party to emerge with serious momentum . Now , they are practically on top of each other . In 2008 and again this year , they were separated by just a weekend . And so whatever momentum the first convention might create could theoretically vanish within days , if not hours .\nThat 's what happened four years ago . The Democratic convention that nominated Obama in Denver was seen as a home run , not to mention historic . Gallup showed the Dems with a four-point bounce . But Republicans , aware of what they were up against , struck quickly . John McCain waited just one day after the Democrats left Denver to announce Sarah Palin as his running mate . In the first Gallup survey after the Republican confab in St. Paul , McCain jumped to a 49-44 percent lead over Obama .\nAnd it looks like we 're seeing a similar situation this year . The Republicans went first and nominated Mitt Romney in Tampa . A talking chair aside , it went well . But there was no evidence of a meaningful Romney bounce , and it did n't have nearly the kind of emotion that we saw at the Democratic gathering days later in Charlotte . Gallup now has Obama up , 49-45 percent . The Reuters/Ipsos poll also has the President ahead by four points . Said Ipsos pollster Julia Clark , `` The [ convention ] bump is actually happening . I know there was some debate whether it would happen ... but it 's here . ''\nNate Silver , who writes the Five Thirty Eight blog at the New York Times , says the bounce may be more than just a blip :\n`` What 's a bit more worrisome for Mr. Romney is that Gallup 's reporting of the head-to-head results in its poll occurs over a lengthy seven-day window , meaning that only a minority of the interviews in the poll were conducted after the major speeches at the Democratic convention . In fact , most of the interviews in the poll were conducted just after the Republican convention in Tampa , Fla. , a period in which Mr. Romney should have been enjoying a convention bounce of his own . ... It 's certainly important to be cautious when interpreting one-day changes in the polls . But so far , this data is tracking toward a decent-size convention bounce for Mr. Obama . It 's quite unlikely , in fact , that the movement in the polls reflects statistical noise alone . ''\nSilver points out that one day after the convention came a `` mediocre jobs report , '' which certainly ca n't be good news for the Dems . And so ,\n`` The better question , then , is not whether the movement in the polls toward Mr. Obama is 'real , ' but rather how much more of it ( if any ) he will get , and how long it persists . ... Mr. Obama will need to show leads of around four or five points in national polls conducted next week to maintain the advantage the model is now showing for him . ... Mr. Romney entered the conventions in a narrow deficit to Mr. Obama . The fact that he only pulled into a rough tie in the polls after the Republican convention was a bearish sign for him . If Mr. Obama emerges from the conventions in a stronger position than he entered them with , Mr. Romney 's position will have become a bit difficult . ''\nObama can , and will continue to , try to make the case that as disappointing as things are now , Romney and the GOP will make them worse . Republicans in Congress have blocked their attempts at improving the economy every step of the way . That in a nutshell is the president 's strategy .
