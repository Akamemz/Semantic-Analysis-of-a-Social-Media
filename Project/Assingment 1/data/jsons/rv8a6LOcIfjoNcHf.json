    "content": "On Tuesday , Ohio voters will have an opportunity to deal a blow to the war on drugs and mass incarceration .\nOhio Issue 1 , a ballot initiative , would reduce drug possession offenses to misdemeanors , so they \u2019 re no longer classified as felonies with harsher penalties . It would then use the money saved ( because the state wouldn \u2019 t lock up as many people ) on addiction treatment and crime victim funds . It would also allow inmates , with exceptions for those convicted of murder , rape , or child molestation , to reduce their prison sentences by participating in prison rehabilitation programs .\nThe measure is , to say the least , controversial . Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine , the Republican running for governor , said it would be \u201c devastating , \u201d arguing that it would attract more drug dealers to the state . ( There \u2019 s no evidence for this claim . ) Richard Cordray , the Democratic candidate for governor , has argued that the measure would \u201c set the way toward a policy of being smart on crime in the future , smart on how we use taxpayers \u2019 dollars , smart on how we build people \u2019 s potential to be productive citizens in our society . \u201d\nThe policy change that Ohio voters will consider , however , isn \u2019 t new . The defelonization of drug possession offenses is something that five other states have adopted \u2014 to promising results .\nAs America confronts its status as the world \u2019 s leader in incarceration , and governments are faced with the high costs of putting so many people in prison , some states are considering reforms that will help them reduce their prison populations \u2014 with a focus on drug policy in particular .\nOhio Issue 1 is the latest example of that . But it also shows some of the limits of the current criminal justice reform movement .\nOhio Issue 1 is a constitutional amendment , so it would take precedent over standard legislation . Here are some of the major changes it would make , based on the text of the initiative :\nPrevents classifying offenses for using , possessing , or obtaining illicit drugs , such as heroin , fentanyl , cocaine , or meth , as felonies , instead requiring they be treated as misdemeanors .\nProhibits jail or prison time for such offenses , unless it \u2019 s an individual \u2019 s third offense , or more , within two years .\nAllows individuals who were previously convicted of such offenses to ask a court to reduce their conviction to a misdemeanor .\nAims to reduce the use of prison time for non-criminal probation violations .\nApplies financial savings to addiction treatment programs and crime victim funds .\nAllows people in prison , except those incarcerated for murder , rape , or child molestation , to seek sentence reductions up to 25 percent if they participate in rehabilitative programs , up from 8 percent under current rules .\nThe proposal was put forward by the Ohio Safe and Healthy Communities Campaign , also known as Yes on 1 . Financially , it \u2019 s received a lot of outside support \u2014 including from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ( which is in part owned by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg ) , the Open Society Policy Center ( founded by liberal billionaire George Soros ) , and the Open Philanthropy Project .\nNotably , the initiative still allows state law to classify drug offenses for distribution and sales as felonies . So those offenses can remain on the books , and drug dealers and traffickers can still be punished as felons .\nPublic polling on the measure is limited . A survey released in October by Baldwin Wallace University found that almost 48 percent of likely voters back Issue 1 , while nearly 31 percent oppose it and more than 21 percent are undecided .\nWhat happens if Issue 1 passes ? This actually isn \u2019 t new territory \u2014 because five states have enacted drug defelonization laws in recent years . It started with California in 2014 , when its voters approved Proposition 47 . Since then , Connecticut , Utah , Alaska , and Oklahoma have enacted similar measures , according to a report on the laws by the Urban Institute \u2019 s Justice Policy Center .\nUrban researchers Brian Elderbroom and Julia Durnan wrote that the measures cut prison populations and saved money , letting resources go to areas besides prisons . In California , for example , state officials estimated that \u201c Proposition 47 reduced prison spending by $ 68 million in the first year alone , and California awarded more than $ 100 million in grants to local governments for mental health treatment , victims \u2019 services , and crime prevention programs . \u201d\nCalifornia \u2019 s measure also didn \u2019 t lead to more crime , Elderbroom and Durnan noted : \u201c Crime analyses conducted in 2018 found that while rates of certain property crimes in California have increased slightly over the past several years , there is no causal relationship between passage of Proposition 47 and crime . \u201d\nThe Urban researchers concluded : \u201c Reclassifying drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor can reduce the negative impacts imposed on people and communities by felony convictions , reduce imprisonment of people convicted of drug possession , and redirect limited resources to treatment and prevention without negatively impacting public safety . \u201d\nTo some degree , this should be expected . Research has long indicated that the severity of punishment has very little effect on someone \u2019 s willingness to commit a crime or use drugs . For example , a 2014 study from Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago found there \u2019 s no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than lighter penalties .\nSo it doesn \u2019 t matter so much if people are punished harshly ( through , say , a felony ) than whether they \u2019 re punished more leniently ( through , say , a misdemeanor ) .\nIn Ohio , critics of Issue 1 have pointed to another concern : that reducing drug offenses from felonies to misdemeanors will make it harder to get people into addiction treatment . As it stands , drug courts use the threat of criminal punishment \u2014 and prison in particular \u2014 to get drug offenders to agree to addiction treatment . If that threat is removed , then judges will be less able to push people into treatment . Critics point to California \u2019 s example , where drug court participation in some areas has dropped in the aftermath of Proposition 47 .\nBut supporters of Issue 1 argue that the savings produced by the initiative \u2014 which will be largely put into addiction treatment \u2014 will actually lead to more access to treatment , not less .\nThere are also broader philosophical questions here : Should drug addiction be left to the criminal justice system to deal with , or the health care system ? Should both play a role ? What \u2019 s the right balance to strike here ?\nHow the addiction treatment aspect of the issue will play out remains to be seen . But this is a particularly pertinent issue in Ohio , because it \u2019 s one of the states hit hardest by the opioid epidemic .\nIn the international arena , there \u2019 s a good basis for what Issue 1 supporters are arguing here : Portugal . In 2001 , Portugal decriminalized all drugs and dramatically ramped up treatment with , among other interventions , special commissions that direct problem drug users to treatment . In the ensuing years , Portugal saw drops in drug-related deaths and reported past-year and past-month drug use , although some increases in lifetime prevalence of drug use and an uptick in reported drug use among teens after 2007 , according to a 2014 report from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation .\nOhio is not going as far as Portugal . It \u2019 s not fully decriminalizing drugs , since drug possession offenses will remain misdemeanors . And it \u2019 s not dedicating anywhere as many resources to addiction treatment as Portugal did . But Issue 1 is in some ways a downscaled version of the Portuguese approach , so some lessons can be drawn \u2014 and they suggest that the critics of Issue 1 are buying into hyperbole .\nAs Jessie Balmert put it for the Cincinnati Enquirer , \u201c Some say [ Issue 1 ] will destroy the state . Others claim it will cure Ohio \u2019 s drug problem . Neither is true . \u201d\nDrug defelonization is a start . But to fully address mass incarceration , states will have to go further .\nWhat about mass incarceration ? Proposition 47 , Issue 1 , and other proposals like them have been pitched in recent years to help reduce America \u2019 s staggering prison population .\nAccording to the World Prison Brief , the US incarceration rate is 655 per 100,000 people . That \u2019 s higher than any other country in the world , including authoritarian nations like Russia ( 402 ) and China ( 118 ) . It \u2019 s higher than comparable developed nations like Canada ( 114 ) , Germany ( 75 ) , and Japan ( 41 ) , which have similar levels of crime \u2014 or lower , particularly when it comes to murder and gun violence \u2014 compared to America .\nSending fewer people to prison for drugs , as Proposition 47 and Issue 1 aim to do , will help get the US to more reasonable levels of incarceration .\nOver the past few years , there has been a powerful narrative told about mass incarceration , through books like Michelle Alexander \u2019 s The New Jim Crow , suggesting that America \u2019 s war on drugs has been the primary driver of mass incarceration .\nThis isn \u2019 t right . The latest data from the US Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that in state prisons , where about 87 percent of US inmates are held , nearly 55 percent are in for violent offenses ( such as murder , manslaughter , robbery , assault , and rape ) , while only a little more than 15 percent are in for drug offenses .\nThese figures are at best a minimum for the number of violent offenders in prison . It \u2019 s not rare for violent offenders to plea down their charges to nonviolent crimes ; this lets offenders get a lower sentence , and it lets prosecutors and judges skip a costly trial . So at least some of the supposedly nonviolent offenders have likely committed violent crimes .\nSo if the US is to significantly reduce prison populations , it \u2019 s going to have to address non-drug crimes . For example , the criminal justice advocacy group # cut50 aims to reduce the prison population by 50 percent . This is going to be simply impossible if the focus is only on drug crimes , given that only around 15 percent of people in state prisons are in for drug offenses .\nAnd even if the US reduced its prison population by 50 percent , its resulting incarceration rate of around 300 per 100,000 people would still dwarf countries like Canada , Germany , and Japan , none of which have incarceration rates above 120 .\nOhio Issue 1 makes some progress in non-drug areas by allowing sentencing reductions up to 25 percent for other offenses . But this also comes with the caveat that it totally excludes people incarcerated for murder , rape , or child molestation \u2014 showing that there are some crimes that even reformers consider out of bounds for change , which may make it harder to cut prison populations further down the line .\nMeasures like Issue 1 , then , chip away at the global incarceration disparity between the US and other countries . But if the US wants to get closer to other developed nations \u2019 levels , it will eventually need to go much further \u2014 and that will require reform beyond the war on drugs .",
