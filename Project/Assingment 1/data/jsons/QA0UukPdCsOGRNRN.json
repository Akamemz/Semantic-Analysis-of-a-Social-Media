    "content": "A trove of more than 800 pages of emails sheds new light on the working relationship between Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , one of the most potent power couples in Washington \u2014 including their dealings with McConnell supporters from their home state of Kentucky .\nChao has met at least 10 times with politicians and business leaders from the state in response to requests from McConnell \u2019 s office , according to documents provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 by the watchdog group American Oversight . In some cases , those people later received what they were hoping for from Chao \u2019 s department , including infrastructure grants , the designation of an interstate highway and assistance in getting state funds for a highway project \u2014 although the documents don \u2019 t indicate that the meetings led to those outcomes .\nThe records also do not show how frequently Chao has met with people from outside Kentucky , a state her husband has represented in the Senate since 1985 , or how readily she has responded to similar requests from other lawmakers . But at least a dozen of the emails show McConnell \u2019 s staff acting as a conduit between Chao and Kentucky political figures or business leaders , some of whom previously have had relationships with the couple .\nIn one email from Feb. 2 , 2017 , just days after Chao was sworn in , McConnell \u2019 s state director emailed a Chao lieutenant asking the secretary to meet with maritime industry lobbyist Jim Adams about proposed changes to \u201c Buy American , Hire American \u201d requirements for offshore drilling equipment . The lobbyist and his wife , a Kentucky state senator who used to work for McConnell , donated $ 1,500 to McConnell \u2019 s 2014 reelection campaign , according to Federal Election Commission filings .\n\u201c The Secretary knows them both well , \u201d McConnell state director Terry Carmack wrote to Todd Inman , who at the time was director of operations at the Department of Transportation .

Carmack wrote that DeLancey was \u201c the Calloway county GOP chairman and about to be the first district GOP chair. \u201d Chao met with someone from Taylor Motors in July 2017 . When the McConnell staffer asked Inman to arrange a meeting for executive director Jason Vincent and other people from Pennyrile Area Development District during a March 2017 fly-in , he noted that some of the representatives were \u201c friends . \u201d\nAmerican Oversight obtained the emails under the Freedom of Information Act . The group \u2019 s founder and executive director , Austin Evers , said they show an unusually close relationship between a Senate leader and a member of President Donald Trump \u2019 s Cabinet \u2014 and that \u201c Secretary Chao built a political operation in her office to favor Kentucky . \u201d\n\u201c We launched this investigation because we were intrigued by the president \u2019 s selection of Elaine Chao as Transportation secretary , \u201d Evers said . \u201c The media and political class identified it as a savvy move to hire the spouse of the majority leader of the Senate . We wanted to see what that relationship looked like . \u201d\nDOT said no such favoritism exists , and that any agency \u201c would be responsive to the requests of the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate . \u201d\nChao \u2019 s office treats \u201c requests from Congress with serious consideration and is responsive to all members and their staff , \u201d a spokesperson said . \u201c She understands the needs of Kentucky , which is her home , and naturally has enjoyed a long friendship with many of the people who are also in contact with Sen. McConnell \u2019 s office . \u201d\nWhen asked about the propriety of setting up meetings for constituents , a spokesperson for McConnell told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that \u201c the leader regularly advocates for Kentuckians with members of the Cabinet and agencies of the federal government . \u201d\n\u201c He has advocated on behalf of Kentuckians his entire career \u2014 and that includes both Republican and Democrat administrations , \u201d the spokesperson added .\nAt the very least , the emails offer a rare glimpse at the working relationship between Chao and McConnell , who aside from a few confrontations with protesters , typically maintain a low public profile about their mutual interactions . But other people familiar with the workings of DOT and Congress said they didn \u2019 t see anything unusual in a Cabinet secretary responding to requests from lawmakers .\nA Democratic Senate aide said it \u2019 s common for members of Congress to contact DOT or other agencies on behalf of their constituents and that the department is responsive and accommodating to all .\n\u201c DOT will talk to anyone , \u201d said the aide , who requested anonymity because of his ongoing dealings with the department . He said he doesn \u2019 t often ask Chao to take meetings because \u201c people know they can pick up the phone and call DOT themselves , \u201d but that on occasion he will \u201c make an introduction . \u201d\n\u201c DOT will talk to anyone , \u201d said the aide , who requested anonymity because of his ongoing dealings with the department . He said he doesn \u2019 t often ask Chao to take meetings because \u201c people know they can pick up the phone and call DOT themselves , \u201d but that on occasion he will \u201c make an introduction . \u201d\nFormer Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta , a Democrat who served under President George W. Bush , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 it \u201c happened a lot \u201d that lawmakers asked him to meet with constituents traveling to Washington , \u201c and then you would meet with them. \u201d Mineta said a request from a member of Congress would carry additional weight , regardless of what state that member was from .\n\u201c Of course you \u2019 re going to meet with people from your home state , \u201d added a former DOT official from the Obama administration who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about the department she once worked for .\nBut Evers from American Oversight contended that in these emails , Chao \u2019 s staff appear to go out of their way to make McConnell \u2019 s Kentucky contacts \u201c feel special. \u201d In one March 2017 email to Inman , requesting a meeting between Chao and the group Kentuckians for Better Transportation , Carmack suggested that if Chao couldn \u2019 t make it , perhaps \u201c an assistant secretary or 2 \u201d could . \u201c That way it is not taking up the Secretary \u2019 s time but they feel special , \u201d Carmack continued .\nInman had previously told Carmack that Chao \u2019 s office was planning to decline the meeting . But the meeting later appeared on Chao \u2019 s calendar for the following May 17 .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of two months of Chao \u2019 s calendar over her first 14 months in office doesn \u2019 t reveal a particular preference for Kentucky visitors \u2014 in more than 100 meetings and phone calls with people outside the executive branch , none had an apparent Kentucky connection .\nStill , Evers highlighted two instances when DOT \u2019 s Inman instructed McConnell staffers to flag requests from Kentuckians for him in addition to sending them to Chao \u2019 s schedulers , \u201c to make sure we take an extra look at \u201d them .\n\u201c The Secretary has indicated if you have a [ Kentucky- ] specific issue that we should flag for her attention to please continue to go through your normal channels but feel free to contact me directly as well so we can monitor or follow up as necessary , \u201d Inman wrote to McConnell \u2019 s then-chief of staff , Brian McGuire , in an email from Feb. 28 , 2017 .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a normal channel and a Kentucky channel , \u201d Evers said . \u201c It would be surprising if there was also an Arizona channel and a California channel . \u201d\nAnd , on a tentative list of staff duties Inman shared with McConnell \u2019 s office soon after he started , \u201c Kentucky \u201d is listed as one of Inman \u2019 s responsibilities . No other state is included in any of the other 26 staffers \u2019 list of duties .\nInman , who became Chao \u2019 s chief of staff last month , was a Republican political operative in Kentucky before joining DOT . He communicated frequently with McConnell staff for most of his first year in the job , until an assistant secretary for government affairs was confirmed .\nThe email cache is also sprinkled with instances of McConnell staffers referring to meeting seekers \u2019 personal ties to the couple and their status as GOP supporters .\nIn one email thread from March 2017 , McConnell \u2019 s staff describes Hart County , Ky. , Judge/Executive Terry Martin \u2014 the county \u2019 s top elected official \u2014 as a \u201c loyal supporter \u201d and \u201c friend . \u201d\nChao met with Martin two weeks later and again a year later .\nShe met on March 20 , 2017 , with representatives from the Pennyrile Area Development District , who had gotten similar praise and were interested in discussing their long-running priority of redesignating the Breathitt Pennyrile Parkway as Interstate 169 . President Donald Trump signed into law a bill sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) , designating the highway I-169 in May 2017 .\nIn another February 2017 email exchange , Carmack asked Inman to set up a meeting with two Kentucky county judge/executives who wanted to talk about bridge and highway problems in their counties . \u201c Always value your input , \u201d Inman responded .\nHarlan County Judge/Executive Dan Mosley , who met with Chao in April 2017 about widening and improving a flood-prone stretch of U.S. 421 , said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Chao was \u201c one of the smartest people I \u2019 ve ever met \u201d and that \u201c her commitment to transportation issues \u201d was evident in their meeting . After they met , a Federal Highway Administration official came to evaluate the project , and eventually the state allocated $ 800,000 to start the project , Mosley told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nBoone County Judge/Executive Gary Moore , who asked for and , in June 2018 , received a $ 68 million DOT grant for two interstate interchanges , said he met with Chao and asked for her support for the grant at his December 2017 meeting with her . Boone County had been seeking a federal grant for this since at least 2017 .\nCooperation between the two offices goes in both directions , the emails indicate . In May 2017 , a group of real estate company representatives and public officials from China enjoyed a Capitol tour organized jointly by Chao \u2019 s and McConnell \u2019 s offices . The group \u201c was thrilled to get the VIP treatment by [ McConnell \u2019 s ] office and were particularly excited to hear that the leader \u2019 s office was normally off limits to normal guests , \u201d Melissa Fwu of Chao \u2019 s office wrote in an email to a McConnell aide .\nOversight groups aren \u2019 t just worried about the meetings Chao is granting , however . A previously unreleased report from the watchdog group Restore Public Trust questions the 2018 choice of a town of about 25,000 residents situated near the Tennessee , Ohio , Cumberland and Mississippi rivers , as the site of a new DOT maritime gateway office intended to help coordinate between port operators and government bodies to help improve freight movement on inland waterways .\nPaducah is the smallest city to host one of DOT \u2019 s 10 maritime gateway offices . The nine other such offices are in major cities such as New York , Chicago and Miami .\n\u201c This is the kind of stuff the American public hates , \u201d said Caroline Ciccone , executive director of Restore Public Trust , adding that a \u201c prudent elected official \u201d will avoid favoritism \u201c not just because it looks bad , it \u2019 s because it is bad . \u201d\nBut a DOT spokesperson who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the department chose Paducah because it \u2019 s \u201c always been a natural hub for regional inland waterway traffic , \u201d given its proximity to four major rivers and the presence of \u201c more U.S.-flag inland waterway operators than anywhere else in the nation. \u201d The low cost of living also made it attractive , the spokesperson said .\nThe spokesperson said a strategic analysis , undertaken by the Maritime Administration in 2015 , resulted in a decision to close one of two gateway offices in California in favor of one on the inland waterways to support the St. Louis office . Paducah was chosen out of five inland waterway locations that were evaluated .\nDeb Calhoun , senior vice president of the Waterways Council , called Paducah \u201c the epicenter of the inland marine industry . \u201d\n\u201c Many of the major inland operators have offices in Paducah , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c There is a maritime training center .
