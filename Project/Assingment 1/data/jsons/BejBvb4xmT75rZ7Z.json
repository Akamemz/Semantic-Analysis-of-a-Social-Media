Doctors are trying to figure it out .\nIn late March , when Covid-19 was first surging , Jake Suett , a doctor of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine with the National Health Service in Norfolk , England , had seen plenty of patients with the disease \u2014 and intubated a few of them .\nThen one day , he started to feel unwell , tired , with a sore throat .

The most successful draw on existing post-ICU protocols and a wide range of experts , from pulmonologists to psychiatrists . Yet even as care improves , patients are also running into familiar challenges in finding treatment : accessing and being able to pay for it .\nScientists are still learning about the many ways the virus that causes Covid-19 impacts the body \u2014 both during initial infection and as symptoms persist .\nOne of the researchers studying them is Michael Peluso , a clinical fellow in infectious diseases at the University of California San Francisco , who is currently enrolling Covid-19 patients in San Francisco in a two-year study to study the disease \u2019 s long-term effects . The goal is to better understand what symptoms people are developing , how long they last , and eventually , the mechanisms that cause them . This could help scientists answer questions like how antibodies and immune cells called T-cells respond to the virus , and how different individuals might have different immune responses , leading to longer or shorter recovery times .\nAt the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic , \u201c the assumption was that people would get better , and then it was over , \u201d Peluso says . \u201c But we know from lots of other viral infections that there is almost always a subset of people who experience longer-term consequences. \u201d He explains these can be due to damage to the body during the initial illness , the result of lingering viral infection , or because of complex immunological responses that occur after the initial disease .\n\u201c People sick enough to be hospitalized are likely to experience prolonged recovery , but with Covid-19 , we \u2019 re seeing tremendous variability , \u201d he says . It \u2019 s not necessarily just the sickest patients who experience long-term symptoms , but often people who weren \u2019 t even initially hospitalized .\n\u201c We know from lots of other viral infections that there is almost always a subset of people who experience longer-term consequences \u201d\nThat \u2019 s why long-term studies of large numbers of Covid-19 patients are so important , Peluso says . Once researchers can find what might be causing long-term symptoms , they can start targeting treatments to help people feel better . \u201c I hope that a few months from now , we \u2019 ll have a sense if there is a biological target for managing some of these long-term symptoms . \u201d\nLekshmi Santhosh , a physician lead and founder of the new post-Covid OPTIMAL Clinic at UCSF , says many of her patients are reporting the same kinds of problems . \u201c The majority of patients have either persistent shortness of breath and/or fatigue for weeks to months , \u201d she says .\nAdditionally , Timothy Henrich , a virologist and viral immunologist at UCSF who is also a principal investigator in the study , says that getting better at managing the initial illness may also help . \u201c More effective acute treatments may also help reduce severity and duration of post-infectious symptoms . \u201d\nIn the meantime , doctors can already help patients by treating some of their lingering symptoms . But the first step , Peluso explains , is not dismissing them . \u201c It is important that patients know \u2014 and that doctors send the message \u2014 that they can help manage these symptoms , even if they are incompletely understood , \u201d he says . \u201c It sounds like many people may not be being told that . \u201d\nEven though we have a lot to learn about the specific damage Covid-19 can cause , doctors already know quite a bit about recovery from other viruses : namely , how complex and challenging a task long-term recovery from any serious infection can be for many patients .\nGenerally , it \u2019 s common for patients who have been hospitalized , intubated , or ventilated \u2014 as is common with severe Covid-19 \u2014 to have a long recovery . Being bed-bound can cause muscle weakness , known as deconditioning , which can result in prolonged shortness of breath . After a severe illness , many people also experience anxiety , depression , and PTSD .\nA stay in the ICU not uncommonly leads to delirium , a serious mental disorder sometimes resulting in confused thinking , hallucinations , and reduced awareness of surroundings . But Covid-19 has created a \u201c delirium factory , \u201d says Santhosh at UCSF . This is because the illness has meant long hospital stays , interactions only with staff in full PPE , and the absence of family or other visitors .\nTheodore Iwashyna , an ICU physician-scientist at the University of Michigan and VA Ann Arbor , is involved with the CAIRO Network , a group of 40 post-intensive care clinics on four continents . In general , after patients are discharged from ICUs , he says , \u201c about half of people have some substantial new disability , and half will never get back to work . Maybe a third of people will have some degree of cognitive impairment . And a third have emotional problems. \u201d And it \u2019 s common for them to have difficulty getting care for their ongoing symptoms after being discharged .\nIn working with Covid-19 patients , says Santhosh , she tells patients , \u201c We believe you ... and we are going to work on the mind and body together . \u201d\nYet it \u2019 s currently impossible to predict who will have long-lasting symptoms from Covid-19 . \u201c People who are older and frailer with more comorbidities are more likely to have longer physical recovery . However , I \u2019 ve seen a lot of young people be really , really sick , \u201d Santhosh says . \u201c They will have a long tail of recovery too . \u201d\nAt the new OPTIMAL Clinic at UCSF , doctors are seeing patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19 at the UCSF health system , as well as taking referrals of other patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms . For ongoing cough and chest tightness , the clinic is providing inhalers , as well as pulmonary rehabilitation , including gradual aerobic exercise with oxygen monitoring . They \u2019 re also connecting patients with mental health resources .\n\u201c Normalizing those symptoms , as well as plugging people into mental health care , is really critical , \u201d says Santhosh , who is also the physician lead and founder of the clinic . \u201c I want people to know this is real . It \u2019 s not \u2018 in their heads . \u2019 \u201d\nNeeta Thakur , a pulmonary specialist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center who has been providing care for Covid-19 patients in the ICU , just opened a similar outpatient clinic for post-Covid care . Thakur has also arranged a multidisciplinary approach , including occupational and physical therapy , as well as expedited referrals to neurology colleagues for rehabilitation for the muscles and nerves that can often be compressed when patients are prone for long periods in the ICU . But she \u2019 s most concerned by the cognitive impairments she \u2019 s seeing , especially as she \u2019 s dealing with a lot of younger patients .\nThese California centers join new post-Covid-19 clinics in major cities across the country , including Mount Sinai in New York and National Jewish Health Hospital in Denver . As more and more hospitals begin to focus on post-Covid care , Iwashyna suggests patients try to seek treatment where they were hospitalized , if possible , because of the difficulty in transferring sufficient medical records .\nSantosh recommends that patients with persistent symptoms call their closest hospital , or nearest academic medical center \u2019 s pulmonary division , and ask if they can participate in any clinical trials . Many of the new clinics are enrolling patients in studies to try to better understand the long-term consequences of the disease . Fortunately , treatment associated with research is often free , and sometimes also offers financial incentives to participants .\nBut otherwise , one of the biggest challenges in post-Covid-19 treatment is \u2014 like so much of American health care \u2014 being able to pay for it .\nOutside of clinical trials , cost can be a barrier to treatment . It can be tricky to get insurance to cover long-term care , Iwashyna notes . After being discharged from an ICU , he says , \u201c Recovery depends on [ patients \u2019 ] social support , and how broke they are afterward. \u201d Many struggle to cover the costs of treatment . \u201c Our patient population is all underinsured , \u201d says Thakur , noting that her hospital works with patients to try to help cover costs .\nRelated 4 aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic that will be felt for years\nLasting health impacts can also affect a person \u2019 s ability to go back to work . In Iwashyna \u2019 s experience , many patients quickly run through their guaranteed 12 weeks of leave under the Family Medical and Leave Act , which isn \u2019 t required to be paid . Eve Leckie , a 39-year-old ICU nurse in New Hampshire , came down with Covid-19 on March 15 . Since then , Leckie has experienced symptom relapses and still can \u2019 t even get a drink of water without help .\n\u201c I \u2019 m typing this to you from my bed , because I \u2019 m too short of breath today to get out , \u201d they say . \u201c This could disable me for the rest of my life , and I have no idea how much that would cost , or at what point I will lose my insurance , since it \u2019 s dependent on my employment , and I \u2019 m incapable of working. \u201d Leckie was the sole wage earner for their five children , and was facing eviction when their partner \u201c essentially rescued us , \u201d allowing them to move in .\nThese long-term burdens are not being felt equally . At Thakur \u2019 s hospital in San Francisco , \u201c The population [ admitted ] here is younger and Latinx , a disparity which reflects who gets exposed , \u201d she says . She worries that during the pandemic , \u201c social and structural determinants of health will just widen disparities across the board. \u201d People of color have been disproportionately affected by the virus , in part because they are less likely to be able to work from home .\nBlack people are also more likely to be hospitalized if they get Covid-19 , both because of higher rates of preexisting conditions \u2014 which are the result of structural inequality \u2014 and because of lack of access to health care .\n\u201c If you are more likely to be exposed because of your job , and likely to seek care later because of fear of cost , or needing to work , you \u2019 re more likely to have severe disease , \u201d Thakur says . \u201c As a result , you \u2019 re more likely to have long-term consequences . Depending on what that looks like , your ability to work and economic opportunities will be hindered . It \u2019 s a very striking example of how social determinants of health can really impact someone over their lifetime . \u201d\nIf policies don \u2019 t support people with persistent symptoms in getting the care they need , ongoing Covid-19 challenges will deepen what \u2019 s already a clear crisis of inequality .\nIwashyna explains that a lot of extended treatment for Covid-19 patients is \u201c going to be about interactions with health care systems that are not well-designed . The correctable problems often involve helping people navigate a horribly fragmented health care system .\n\u201c We can fix that , but we \u2019 re not going to fix that tomorrow .
