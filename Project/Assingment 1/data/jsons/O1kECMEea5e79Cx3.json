    "content": "President Barack Obama sought to change the narrative on Capitol Hill and the nation on Wednesday , with a much-anticipated economic speech at Knox College in Illinois , the first in a series of speeches he wants to give about his vision for rebuilding the economy .\nStepping out ahead of what is shaping up to be a heated debt-ceiling showdown in the fall , Obama spoke of the progress made and the challenges ahead , and offered his solutions , based on building out from the middle class -- a concept that has stuck with the president since his first term in office .\n\u201c When middle-class families have less to spend , businesses have fewer customers , \u201d Obama said . \u201c When wealth concentrates at the very top , it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy . ... That \u2019 s why reversing these trends must be Washington \u2019 s highest priority . It \u2019 s certainly my highest priority . Unfortunately , over the past couple of years in particular , Washington hasn \u2019 t just ignored the problem ; too often , it \u2019 s made things worse . \u201d\nObama wants to do these things to help strengthen the middle class :\n-- Promote new initiatives so that manufacturers can bring additional jobs back home and create jobs in the energy sector ;\n-- Have high-quality pre-school for every 4-year-old across the nation ;\n-- Work on his own to remove red tape for responsible families who want a mortgage but can \u2019 t get one ;\n-- Tackle the rising cost of higher education , and helping to get people out of poverty ; and\nObama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer revealed on Sunday that job security , education , homeownership , healthcare , and saving will form the cornerstone of these speeches . \u201c They will include new ideas and new pushes for ideas he has discussed before , \u201d he wrote in a post . \u201c They \u2019 ll outline steps Congress can take , steps he \u2019 ll take on his own , and steps the private sector can take that benefit us all . The point is to chart a course for where America needs to go -- not just in the next three months or even the next three years , but a steady , persistent effort over the long term to restore this country \u2019 s basic bargain for the middle class . \u201d\nBut Republicans are showing reluctance to many of Obama \u2019 s proposals . They have been doing so for a long time , in fact . At the moment , congressional Republicans are focused on gutting the Affordable Care Act , commonly called Obamacare , which they have tried unsuccessfully to repeal more than 30 times and now want to defund ; they have no intention of raising the debt ceiling or eliminating it altogether ; they also don \u2019 t want to hear about raising any taxes . What they want is the spending cuts promised to them in the deal for raising taxes on upper income brackets earlier this year , and it appears they are willing to do anything to get it , even shut down the government if Obamacare gets one dime .\n\u201c Well , welcome to the conversation , Mr. President , we \u2019 ve never left it , \u201d Boehner said at a press conference on Tuesday . \u201c We \u2019 ve been focused on jobs for the last two and half years -- actually , longer than that -- but the two and half years we \u2019 ve been in the majority . \u201d\nIf Obama was serious about helping the economy , Boehner said , he wouldn \u2019 t be taking the podium instead of reaching out and working with Republicans . So the trust deficit between the two sides continues . \u201c This is all about a big setup that \u2019 s coming in this speech , \u201d he added . \u201c The president wants to raise taxes so he can do more \u2018 stimulus \u2019 spending . And the fact is , it \u2019 s his sequester and if we \u2019 re going to get rid of his sequester , we \u2019 re going to have to look for smarter spending cuts in order to do that . \u201d\nTwo key parts of the president \u2019 s second-term agenda , gun control and immigration reform , have either been destroyed or stunted , but he \u2019 s refusing to back down on the issue of the economy , which is still recovering slowly .\nWith a deficit that the Congressional Budget Office projects to fluctuate between 2.4 percent and 3.8 percent of gross domestic product over the next decade , there are more pressing issues than reining in the deficit , according to some economists -- such as helping Americans return to work . The nation \u2019 s unemployment rate remains steady at 7.6 percent . But when part-time employees and those who have stopped looking for work are factored in , the real unemployment numbers are in the double digits .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a more pressing issue than the things Washington has spent most of the last year discussing , \u201d said Michael Strain , an economist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute . \u201c I hope the president has some ideas and policies and some thoughts to share with the country about how to put Americans back to work . \u201d\nBut Strain isn \u2019 t optimistic that Congress will work with the president and across party lines to pass any significant pieces of legislation . \u201c External events could force the hand of the government , \u201d he said , \u201c but these guys aren \u2019 t playing nicely together and that \u2019 s somewhat discouraging . \u201d\nStill , Strain thinks there are policy solutions that both Democrats and Republicans can get behind to start making some real changes : reforming the unemployment system ; bring in more high-skilled immigrants , whether through comprehensive immigration reform or a separate jobs plan ; reduce barriers for potential entrepreneurs ; and even temporarily eliminating capital-gain taxes on new business investments , to help potential entrepreneurs attract capital .\nLike Strain , Lance Roberts , chief economist at Street Talk Advisors , believes both parties working together can solve some of the problems . Over the next three years , said Roberts , economic growth will still be pretty much sluggish as long as the policies now in place remain or new ones do n't lead to further economic restraints .\nFor him , there \u2019 s no doubt federal bailouts and other programs under the Obama administration prevented an economic depression , but getting people into full-time employment must be the focus now . That would lead to increased consumer confidence and spending .\nBut the president alone isn \u2019 t to blame , Roberts said , adding decades of bad decisions that begun under President Reagan play a role . \u201c We are just in the back end cycle of a long policy of bad fiscal decisions and increasing debt and running deficits to no end , \u201d he said . \u201c So now we are dealing with the deleterious effects on the economy of those previous decisions . \u201d\nThe key , though , is getting Americans to a place where they can spend money again . \u201c Consumption is what we need to drive economic growth , \u201d Roberts said .",
