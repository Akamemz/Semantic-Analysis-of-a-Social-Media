The president is openly disdainful of the rule of law and is now undermining Congress \u2019 s ability to exercise its lawful powers of oversight . But is it fair to say that we \u2019 ve crossed a red line ?\nJerry Nadler , the Democratic chair of the House Judiciary Committee , is the latest to argue that we have . After the White House invoked executive privilege and refused to release the full , unredacted version of the Mueller report last week , Nadler told CNN that we are in a \u201c constitutional crisis \u201d because \u201c the president is disobeying the law , is refusing all information to Congress . \u201d\nBut , Nadler added , \u201c I don \u2019 t like to use that phrase because it \u2019 s been used for far less dangerous situations . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s one of the biggest problems with the concept of a \u201c constitutional crisis \u201d : It \u2019 s poorly defined . There \u2019 s no set of agreed-upon conditions , no ultimate standard that indicates when a country has officially entered into a constitutional crisis . Instead , we can only look at a country \u2019 s political system and ask whether it \u2019 s working as designed , or whether the structures and institutions that hold it together are intact .\nBut even then , it \u2019 s still a complicated question . The American system , for example , is built on conflict , so the line between a crisis and a confrontation is awfully blurry . So long as the people involved are still relying on constitutional mechanisms to resolve disputes , we \u2019 re likely not yet in a crisis .\nTo get some clarity on this , I reached out to 11 constitutional experts and asked them to step back from the latest Trump outrage and answer a more fundamental question : How do you define a constitutional crisis ?\nTheir full responses , edited for clarity and length , are below .\nWe are in a separation of powers war between the president and Congress the likes of which we have never seen . A constitutional crisis is a fight among branches of government in which neither side backs down , and there is no clear resolution within the constitutional system .\nThere have been other wars \u2014 Richard Nixon \u2019 s Watergate ; Ronald Reagan \u2019 s Iran-Contra ; Bill Clinton \u2019 s impeachment . But no president in the 20th century has issued such a wholesale rebuff to Congress . Could you imagine if President Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan had decided not to hand over documents or witnesses ? Presidents and Congresses typically negotiate such matters every day in Washington .\nRebuffing a democratic norm is not a constitutional crisis , however . The separation of powers is as much a separation of popular constituencies as it is a separation of legal powers . When the country is as politically divided as it is now , large institutional clashes are predictable .\nWashington \u2019 s institutions amplify the sounds emitted from state partisan gerrymandering . A president of one party facing a House in another party ensures that separate institutions will voice separate opinions This is a feature , not a bug of the system . To misquote the great political philosopher Hannah Arendt , \u201c power \u201d is the power to speak on behalf of others . In this war , the president is speaking for one set of people ; the House for another .\nA constitutional crisis will occur if one of the parties to this war refuses the third branch \u2014the courts . The House should go to court , and quickly , to enforce its subpoenas . Although the courts are often wary of entering the political realm , in this area they are essential . Executive privilege , after all , is a judicial creation ( there is not a word about it in the Constitution itself ) .\nIf the president refuses to abide by the court orders , then we will have a true constitutional crisis . All three branches will have weighed in at this point . The president takes a constitutional oath to faithfully execute the law . If he willfully rejects the law \u2019 s resolution , he will have violated his oath of office \u2014 as determined by the courts \u2014 in the most fundamental way .\nShort of a new election or impeachment , though , there will be no way to resolve the matter if the president refuses to comply with a court order . Courts have no armies . The judiciary could cite him for contempt , but if his Justice Department will not prosecute ( and we know that they will not ) , then we are at a constitutional crisis .\nWe will have a president who claims to be above the law , capable of thwarting the people and the courts by merely ignoring them .\n\u201c We are in a separation of powers war between the president and Congress the likes of which we have never seen \u201d\nThe rhetoric of \u201c constitutional crisis \u201d has become more common over the past several decades , but the term remains ill-defined . Like \u201c judicial activism , \u201d it often just becomes a way of saying that you really don \u2019 t like something that someone else is doing .\nIt is sometimes used to suggest that someone is violating the Constitution or that the meaning of the Constitution is unclear , but that seems neither helpful nor correct since addressing violations and indeterminacy are routine features of a working constitutional system . And , of course , we might be unhappy or unfamiliar with what the Constitution requires or permits in particular circumstances , but that , too , is a routine part of living in a constitutional system .\nI think a constitutional crisis is best understood to be moments when the constitutional system itself seems to be breaking down . This can happen in two ways : a crisis of operation and a crisis of fidelity .\nA crisis of operation occurs when important political disputes can not be resolved within the existing constitutional framework . An effective constitution is one that provides a structure for contesting and resolving political disputes . When a constitution can no longer do that and our disputes spill outside the constitutional framework , then the constitution itself is in crisis .\nA crisis of fidelity occurs when important political actors are simply unwilling to adhere to the constitutional commitments as they understand them . If consequential political actors determined that a constitutional rule or a prescribed constitutional outcome should be ignored because some other political priority than following the constitution is more important , then the Constitution \u2019 s ability to guide and constrain political behavior has , to that degree , been cast into doubt .\nThe federal government divides power among the legislature , the executive , and the judiciary . These divisions were intended to prevent the consolidation of governmental power in any one place in order to maximize individual liberty and the opportunities for democratic mobilization and change .\nDespite these divisions , we are all under one Constitution . And that Constitution has rules , as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States and as amended and shaped by the people through their elected officials and direct petitions to government .\nA constitutional crisis , therefore , is when one branch of government hijacks this divided system to change the rules in its favor , making the other branches subservient instead of equal and the people \u2019 s voices dim or ineffective , thus handcuffing our democracy .\nThis often happens in plain sight . After the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 , Arkansas Gov . Orval Faubus refused to comply with the unanimous decision and instead ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent black students from attending Little Rock Central High School .\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower insisted the law be followed and sent the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army to enforce the constitutional mandate of equality and protect the black students as they went to school . This was a constitutional crisis in which the states refused to follow the Constitution , and military force , ordered by the president as commander in chief , was required to enforce the law .\nIn a much earlier case , Worcester v. Georgia ( 1832 ) , a constitutional crisis manifested between the president and the Supreme Court . Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that American Indians were independent nations under treaty rules and could not be forced to be removed from their tribal land . In response to this decision , President Andrew Jackson allegedly said , \u201c John Marshall has made his decision ; now let him enforce it ! \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s job under the Constitution is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed . But President Jackson ignored the law and instead allowed the state of Georgia to remove the Cherokee from their land in what became the famous \u201c Trail of Tears. \u201d This constitutional crisis ended with the states and the president refusing to follow the Constitution , and the Supreme Court and Congress unable to resist their power .\nAll members of government swear an oath to uphold the US Constitution , which provides rules for governing as well as for debating changes to those rules . Refusing to follow these rules is one feature of a constitutional crisis . It is cheating . When state legislatures pass laws that are blatantly unconstitutional , when the president of the United States acts as if he is above the law by refusing to follow court orders ( or ordering his Cabinet to refuse to follow court orders ) , when the Senate refuses to debate a Supreme Court nominee for fear of losing party control , a constitutional crisis exists that only the people can fix by insisting the laws be enforced .\nBut if the enforcers are cheating , and the rules for electing new government are constrained by the existing ruling party \u2014 constraints such as controlling [ the process of counting the population via ] the census or limiting access to the ballot \u2014 the people can not solve the crisis within our democratic and constitutional norms .\nThis kind of constitutional crisis can lead to revolution because of the profound inequality , the constraints on liberty the consolidation of power creates , and the feeling of hopelessness both produce .\nThe purpose of a constitution is to structure legitimate government , so that the exercise of power over an entire citizenry by a relatively small handful of elected and appointed officials is morally justified .\nIn a democracy , that moral justification depends on several things : the protection of human rights ; adherence to the rule of law ; structures and practices that help assure , in public policymaking , genuine consideration for the interests of everyone who is subject to the government \u2019 s authority ; and opportunities for all citizens to participate as meaningful political actors in the processes of collective self-determination .\nI define a constitutional crisis as a situation in which existing constitutional arrangements no longer realistically promise to serve the foundational values of democratic constitutionalism .\nUnder Trump , the GOP has been pressing hard against all the values I have named , and it remains unclear whether our institutions are sufficiently resilient to withstand the onslaught . Whether we have yet gone from \u201c yellow alert \u201d to \u201c red alert \u201d is uncertain , but Trump \u2019 s attacks on the free press , courts , and law enforcement institutions , his stonewalling of Congress , his gleeful pledges to direct government assistance to those who support him but not to those who do not \u2014 all this is unprecedented in degree , if not always in kind .\nA 19th-century British prime minister once said , \u201c Every political constitution in which different bodies share the supreme power is only enabled to exist by the forbearance of those among whom this power is distributed. \u201d Our current president shows no such self-restraint , and neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has yet shown itself able to fully check his authoritarian impulses .\nWhat \u2019 s a constitutional crisis ? It \u2019 s not a severe and persistent conflict within the national government . That kind of conflict can precede a change in the previously established relations within the government \u2014 Congress gaining more power than the president , or the reverse . ( Sometimes , of course , even that kind of conflict sputters out and nothing changes . )\nAs long as the new set of relations is broadly democratic , we will have experienced a change but not crisis . Think here of the transition that led to the New Deal or the Reagan Revolution .\nWhen these kinds of conflicts occur , many of us are likely to hold rather strong views about what democracy \u201c really \u201d means , and are likely to think that one or another participant in the conflicts is anti-democratic ( according to our own beliefs ) . We should be generous here , and recognize that the domain of democracy covers quite a wide range of possibilities .\nA constitutional crisis , in my view , would occur when the institutions in place are unable to ensure that the outcome of persistent conflicts will remain within broadly democratic lines . And , unfortunately , we can \u2019 t tell whether that \u2019 s the case until we see how the conflicts play out \u2014 usually over a reasonably extended period of time .\nThat means that we should find severe and persistent conflicts worrisome and should encourage everyone to take a deep breath and think about ways to resolve the conflicts to preserve democracy as broadly understood .\nBut , again , severe and persistent conflicts do not a constitutional crisis make .\nDeclarations of crisis are so common , and so contested , that I don \u2019 t know if the term is useful . I \u2019 m thinking not just of constitutional crisis but also of other areas of law and policy , such as the \u201c criminal justice crisis . \u201d\nWe may indeed face great problems with regard to both criminal law and constitutional democracy . I believe we do face such problems \u2014 but we \u2019 ve lived with these problems for a long time . Sometimes , using the language of crisis is a way of denying the historical longevity of certain problems .\nThat raises the question : Can a crisis be permanent ? I think that \u201c crisis \u201d would be a more useful term if we used it more along the lines that it \u2019 s used in medicine . I have no medical expertise myself , but I believe that medical professionals use the term \u201c crisis \u201d to refer to a specific event that \u2019 s a turning point for a patient . A crisis lasts a finite period , and afterward , the patient is either better or worse , but not the same as she was before the crisis .\nWith regard to the many constitutional disputes and confrontations we are seeing day to day , we could ask : Is this dispute or confrontation unprecedented , or is it similar to disputes that we \u2019 ve seen regularly ? And will this supposed crisis come to an end soon , leaving us much better off or much worse ?\nOf course , the answers to those questions will themselves be deeply contested . But I think asking those questions could improve our understanding of the supposed crisis .\n\u201c A constitutional crisis is a fight among branches of government in which neither side backs down and there is no clear resolution within the constitutional system \u201d\nSanford Levinson , co-author of Democracy and Dysfunction and law professor , UT Austin\nIs there a \u201c constitutional crisis \u201d ? We have to define the term before we can discuss its absence or presence .\nFirst , one might perceive a crisis if those with official power openly declare their intention to violate the law . James Madison suggested one possible scenario in Federalist 41 : \u201c It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation . It is worse than in vain ; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power \u201d ( emphasis added ) . From this perspective , too-rigid limits on official action builds within it the \u201c necessary usurpations \u201d required to respond adequately to some great national challenge .\nThis suggests the second criterion : legalistic adherence to \u201c constitutional barriers \u201d even if we accurately recognize that such adherence poses significant threats . Perhaps it makes sense to say \u201c let justice be done though the heavens fall. \u201d But why would we say \u201c let the Constitution , in every respect , be observed though the heavens fall . \u201d\nNeither of these conditions is obviously present as we speak . No one in the Trump administration is publicly claiming the right simply to ignore the Constitution , though there are moments when they appear to feel hemmed in by constitutional constraints . One might reduce the current situation to an old-fashioned episode of dueling interpretations of a Constitution that in certain respects is notoriously unclear , including the meaning assigned to the judicially created notion of \u201c executive privilege . \u201d\nI am prone to arguing that Congress has acquiesced in the creation of a de facto \u201c constitutional dictatorship \u201d by virtue of its delegation of powers to the executive , seen most clearly at present with regard to the trade war against China . But there is no serious argument that President Donald Trump is \u201c usurping \u201d powers .\nA third possible criterion is public unhappiness about the positions taken by one side or another in a constitutional dispute that manifests as demonstrations or episodes of violence \u2014 such as the original Tea Party , or the acts of civil disobedience attached to the civil rights movement . But here , too , we don \u2019 t see anything today that could truly be described as direct action that is potentially disrupting everyday life .\nSo given all these conditions , I wouldn \u2019 t say that we \u2019 re in a constitutional crisis . But I would add two caveats . First , one must address the extent to which the Constitution itself works to generate what laypeople and pundits might plausibly call \u201c crises \u201d precisely because a contemporary president can find lawyers who can argue ( in more or less good faith ) for remarkably expansive and dangerous conceptions of presidential authority .\nSecondly , legal academics refuse to take seriously the possibility that Donald Trump himself constitutes a genuine crisis not simply because of some of his political positions , but rather because he is manifestly unfit to be president of the United States .\nHamilton , in Federalist 68 , assured his readers that the Electoral College would serve as a way of preventing any manifestly unsuitable person from being elected . Those assurances have turned out to be totally false . From his perspective , the Electoral College ( in addition to its other deficiencies ) has become simply a mode of mob rule . That might suggest another kind of crisis , but that \u2019 s a separate conversation .\nThe concept of a constitutional crisis is not necessarily a pertinent one in our present circumstances . \u201c Crisis \u201d connotes a sharply defined moment of conflict , in this case over the content of constitutional norms .\nBut the experience of other backsliding countries , as Tom Ginsburg and I have demonstrated in our book How to Save a Constitutional Democracy , is not one of a sequence of \u201c crises. \u201d It is rather a process of slow erosion , often through piecemeal institutional and personnel changes . Far more important than any \u201d crisis \u201d over a specific subpoena is thus the long-term erosion of Congress \u2019 s oversight powers .\nAlso important is the ongoing constitutional attack on independent institutions of accountability , such as the independent counsel and the special counsel , under the rubric of \u201c the unitary executive. \u201d It is these long-term trends that are in fact setting the pace for constitutional democracy \u2019 s decline in the United States .\nOf course , specific events can crystallize awareness of these trends , but that \u2019 s not the same thing as the events being determinative on their own ground .\nA constitutional crisis is a fight among branches of government in which neither side backs down , and there is no clear resolution within the constitutional system . Crises are dangerous because they tempt players to engage in extraconstitutional action to get their way .\nSuppose , for example , that an American president was impeached but refused to leave the White House on the grounds that the Senate trial was not conducted properly . In this example , the crisis might be resolved by the imposition of force \u2014 say , the Capitol Police showing up to arrest the president , or the president using his power as commander in chief to order the US Army to protect him . Whatever side would ultimately triumph would be dictated by force , not by law in any direct way .\nThe situation in Venezuela today is a good example of a constitutional crisis . The 2018 reelection of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was disputed , and the National Assembly [ the country \u2019 s legislative branch ] declared that the presidency should be filled in an interim way by the assembly \u2019 s leader , Juan Guaid\u00f3 .\nMaduro \u2019 s handpicked Supreme Court , however , ruled the National Assembly declaration unconstitutional and confirmed Maduro as president . Both sides have relied on different constitutional articles to justify their positions , and international actors are divided on which government to support .\nA crisis is different from a mere confrontation or disagreement about powers . Take the current fight about investigative authority in the United States : Clearly , both the president and the House of Representatives disagree about the scope of congressional authority . But they have not exhausted the constitutional means of resolving the fight . Congress can use its spending power , or try to enforce any contempt orders it issues ; any presidential invocation of executive privilege still needs to be adjudicated .\nSo there have been lots of constitutional confrontations in the United States , but we have had very few constitutional crises .\nWhat counts as a constitutional crisis ? Perhaps , as with pornography , the answer is that we know it when we see it . But maybe we can do better . Political scientist Keith Whittington usefully distinguishes between \u201d crises of fidelity \u201d and \u201c operational crises . \u201d\nIn a crisis of fidelity , powerful political actors systematically violate the Constitution , and do it with impunity . A famous historical example is the way in which state governments for decades got away with egregiously violating constitutional restrictions on racial discrimination after the collapse of Reconstruction .\nAn operational crisis arises when the existing constitutional rules fail to handle some major challenge facing the nation . Whittington focuses on cases where the system fails to resolve major political disagreements . But an operational crisis can also occur if the system fails to deal with some major danger , whether or not the failure is caused by political conflict . In the years before the Civil War , for example , the system failed to effectively address the monstrous injustice of slavery and the political conflict it generated .\nNot every violation of the Constitution qualifies as a crisis of fidelity . Otherwise , we would always be in one , since there has never been perfect compliance . A crisis arises only when there are major , systematic breaches . Similarly , not every policy failure counts as an operational crisis . It has to be a major challenge that the existing system seems chronically incapable of addressing .\nAnother type of potential constitutional crisis arises when there is major disagreement over whether the Constitution has been seriously violated or not \u2014 what Sanford Levinson and Jack Balkin call a \u201c type three \u201d crisis . In periods of severe polarization , like our own , there are often deep divisions about the meaning of the Constitution .\nSuch conflict can escalate to a crisis of its own if political leaders on one side adopt major policies they consider legitimate while opponents view them as serious violations of the Constitution . Such a conflict can potentially be resolved by the courts . But that remedy can fail if the issue is not one that can be resolved in court , or if the judicial decision \u2019 s own legitimacy is called into serious question .\nEven if we avoid crises in the near future , we should also be alert to the threat of more gradual degradation of constitutional rules . Both left and right now claim their opponents are contributing to such rot . And both may have a point .\nThe Constitution of the United States was born of crisis \u2014 of a casting-off of authoritarian bonds with no clear vision of what would replace them . It is the product of a moment when Americans dared to promise equality in an unequal world , to prescribe government by the rule of law rather than the whim of one man .\nThis 230-year experiment at times has been beset by crises \u2014 by moments when events tore at the fabric of the Constitution \u2019 s promise and prescriptions . The abolition of enslavement posed one crisis , the expansion of enfranchisement , another ; both efforts are works in progress , as persons of color , women , and others continue to struggle , despite setbacks , for their due place in the American polity .\nOn sundry occasions in US history , the president has defied a check that a co-equal branch of the federal government has sought to place on him ( to date , the president has always been a man ) . Such defiance , alone , is confrontation . But confrontation soon will escalate to crisis if the legislative or judicial branch abdicates its duty fully to check unwarranted executive behavior .\nIn a succinct statement of the issue , my former boss , Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens , recently told the Wall Street Journal : \u201c The president is exercising powers that do not really belong to him . I mean , he has to comply with subpoenas and things like that. \u201d If the president does not , and if no other branch checks his defiance , that , indeed , will be a constitutional crisis .",

There\u2019s no set of agreed-upon conditions, no ultimate standard that indicates when a country has officially entered into a constitutional crisis. Instead, we can only look at a country\u2019s political system and ask whether it\u2019s working as designed, or whether the structures and institutions that hold it together are intact.\n\nBut even then, it\u2019s still a complicated question. The American system, for example, is built on conflict, so the line between a crisis and a confrontation is awfully blurry. So long as the people involved are still relying on constitutional mechanisms to resolve disputes, we\u2019re likely not yet in a crisis.\n\nTo get some clarity on this, I reached out to 11 constitutional experts and asked them to step back from the latest Trump outrage and answer a more fundamental question: How do you define a constitutional crisis?\n\nTheir full responses, edited for clarity and length, are below.\n\nVictoria Nourse, law professor, Georgetown University\n\nWe are in a separation of powers war between the president and Congress the likes of which we have never seen. A constitutional crisis is a fight among branches of government in which neither side backs down, and there is no clear resolution within the constitutional system.\n\nThere have been other wars \u2014 Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate; Ronald Reagan\u2019s Iran-Contra; Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. But no president in the 20th century has issued such a wholesale rebuff to Congress. Could you imagine if President Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan had decided not to hand over documents or witnesses? Presidents and Congresses typically negotiate such matters every day in Washington.\n\nRebuffing a democratic norm is not a constitutional crisis, however. The separation of powers is as much a separation of popular constituencies as it is a separation of legal powers. When the country is as politically divided as it is now, large institutional clashes are predictable.\n\nWashington\u2019s institutions amplify the sounds emitted from state partisan gerrymandering. A president of one party facing a House in another party ensures that separate institutions will voice separate opinions This is a feature, not a bug of the system. To misquote the great political philosopher Hannah Arendt, \u201cpower\u201d is the power to speak on behalf of others. In this war, the president is speaking for one set of people; the House for another.\n\nA constitutional crisis will occur if one of the parties to this war refuses the third branch \u2014the courts. The House should go to court, and quickly, to enforce its subpoenas. Although the courts are often wary of entering the political realm, in this area they are essential. Executive privilege, after all, is a judicial creation (there is not a word about it in the Constitution itself).\n\nIf the president refuses to abide by the court orders, then we will have a true constitutional crisis. All three branches will have weighed in at this point. The president takes a constitutional oath to faithfully execute the law. If he willfully rejects the law\u2019s resolution, he will have violated his oath of office \u2014 as determined by the courts \u2014 in the most fundamental way.\n\nShort of a new election or impeachment, though, there will be no way to resolve the matter if the president refuses to comply with a court order. Courts have no armies. The judiciary could cite him for contempt, but if his Justice Department will not prosecute (and we know that they will not), then we are at a constitutional crisis.\n\nWe will have a president who claims to be above the law, capable of thwarting the people and the courts by merely ignoring them.\n\n\u201cWe are in a separation of powers war between the president and Congress the likes of which we have never seen\u201d\n\nKeith Whittington, politics professor, Princeton University\n\nThe rhetoric of \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d has become more common over the past several decades, but the term remains ill-defined.

And, of course, we might be unhappy or unfamiliar with what the Constitution requires or permits in particular circumstances, but that, too, is a routine part of living in a constitutional system.\n\nI think a constitutional crisis is best understood to be moments when the constitutional system itself seems to be breaking down. This can happen in two ways: a crisis of operation and a crisis of fidelity.\n\nA crisis of operation occurs when important political disputes cannot be resolved within the existing constitutional framework. An effective constitution is one that provides a structure for contesting and resolving political disputes. When a constitution can no longer do that and our disputes spill outside the constitutional framework, then the constitution itself is in crisis.\n\nA crisis of fidelity occurs when important political actors are simply unwilling to adhere to the constitutional commitments as they understand them. If consequential political actors determined that a constitutional rule or a prescribed constitutional outcome should be ignored because some other political priority than following the constitution is more important, then the Constitution\u2019s ability to guide and constrain political behavior has, to that degree, been cast into doubt.\n\nJessica Silbey, law professor, Northeastern University\n\nThe federal government divides power among the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. These divisions were intended to prevent the consolidation of governmental power in any one place in order to maximize individual liberty and the opportunities for democratic mobilization and change.\n\nDespite these divisions, we are all under one Constitution. And that Constitution has rules, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States and as amended and shaped by the people through their elected officials and direct petitions to government.\n\nA constitutional crisis, therefore, is when one branch of government hijacks this divided system to change the rules in its favor, making the other branches subservient instead of equal and the people\u2019s voices dim or ineffective, thus handcuffing our democracy.\n\nThis often happens in plain sight.

Refusing to follow these rules is one feature of a constitutional crisis. It is cheating. When state legislatures pass laws that are blatantly unconstitutional, when the president of the United States acts as if he is above the law by refusing to follow court orders (or ordering his Cabinet to refuse to follow court orders), when the Senate refuses to debate a Supreme Court nominee for fear of losing party control, a constitutional crisis exists that only the people can fix by insisting the laws be enforced.\n\nBut if the enforcers are cheating, and the rules for electing new government are constrained by the existing ruling party \u2014 constraints such as controlling [the process of counting the population via] the census or limiting access to the ballot \u2014 the people cannot solve the crisis within our democratic and constitutional norms.\n\nThis kind of constitutional crisis can lead to revolution because of the profound inequality, the constraints on liberty the consolidation of power creates, and the feeling of hopelessness both produce.\n\nPeter Shane, law professor, Ohio State University\n\nThe purpose of a constitution is to structure legitimate government, so that the exercise of power over an entire citizenry by a relatively small handful of elected and appointed officials is morally justified.\n\nIn a democracy, that moral justification depends on several things: the protection of human rights; adherence to the rule of law; structures and practices that help assure, in public policymaking, genuine consideration for the interests of everyone who is subject to the government\u2019s authority; and opportunities for all citizens to participate as meaningful political actors in the processes of collective self-determination.\n\nI define a constitutional crisis as a situation in which existing constitutional arrangements no longer realistically promise to serve the foundational values of democratic constitutionalism.\n\nUnder Trump, the GOP has been pressing hard against all the values I have named, and it remains unclear whether our institutions are sufficiently resilient to withstand the onslaught. Whether we have yet gone from \u201cyellow alert\u201d to \u201cred alert\u201d is uncertain, but Trump\u2019s attacks on the free press, courts, and law enforcement institutions, his stonewalling of Congress, his gleeful pledges to direct government assistance to those who support him but not to those who do not \u2014 all this is unprecedented in degree, if not always in kind.\n\nA 19th-century British prime minister once said, \u201cEvery political constitution in which different bodies share the supreme power is only enabled to exist by the forbearance of those among whom this power is distributed.\u201d Our current president shows no such self-restraint, and neither Congress nor the Supreme Court has yet shown itself able to fully check his authoritarian impulses.\n\nMark Tushnet, law professor, Harvard University\n\nWhat\u2019s a constitutional crisis? It\u2019s not a severe and persistent conflict within the national government. That kind of conflict can precede a change in the previously established relations within the government \u2014 Congress gaining more power than the president, or the reverse. (Sometimes, of course, even that kind of conflict sputters out and nothing changes.)\n\nAs long as the new set of relations is broadly democratic, we will have experienced a change but not crisis. Think here of the transition that led to the New Deal or the Reagan Revolution.\n\nWhen these kinds of conflicts occur, many of us are likely to hold rather strong views about what democracy \u201creally\u201d means, and are likely to think that one or another participant in the conflicts is anti-democratic (according to our own beliefs). We should be generous here, and recognize that the domain of democracy covers quite a wide range of possibilities.\n\nA constitutional crisis, in my view, would occur when the institutions in place are unable to ensure that the outcome of persistent conflicts will remain within broadly democratic lines. And, unfortunately, we can\u2019t tell whether that\u2019s the case until we see how the conflicts play out \u2014 usually over a reasonably extended period of time.\n\nThat means that we should find severe and persistent conflicts worrisome and should encourage everyone to take a deep breath and think about ways to resolve the conflicts to preserve democracy as broadly understood.\n\nBut, again, severe and persistent conflicts do not a constitutional crisis make.\n\nAlice Ristroph, law professor, Brooklyn Law School\n\nDeclarations of crisis are so common, and so contested, that I don\u2019t know if the term is useful. I\u2019m thinking not just of constitutional crisis but also of other areas of law and policy, such as the \u201ccriminal justice crisis.\u201d\n\nWe may indeed face great problems with regard to both criminal law and constitutional democracy. I believe we do face such problems \u2014 but we\u2019ve lived with these problems for a long time. Sometimes, using the language of crisis is a way of denying the historical longevity of certain problems.\n\nThat raises the question: Can a crisis be permanent? I think that \u201ccrisis\u201d would be a more useful term if we used it more along the lines that it\u2019s used in medicine. I have no medical expertise myself, but I believe that medical professionals use the term \u201ccrisis\u201d to refer to a specific event that\u2019s a turning point for a patient. A crisis lasts a finite period, and afterward, the patient is either better or worse, but not the same as she was before the crisis.\n\nWith regard to the many constitutional disputes and confrontations we are seeing day to day, we could ask: Is this dispute or confrontation unprecedented, or is it similar to disputes that we\u2019ve seen regularly? And will this supposed crisis come to an end soon, leaving us much better off or much worse?\n\nOf course, the answers to those questions will themselves be deeply contested. But I think asking those questions could improve our understanding of the supposed crisis.\n\n\u201cA constitutional crisis is a fight among branches of government in which neither side backs down and there is no clear resolution within the constitutional system\u201d\n\nSanford Levinson, co-author of Democracy and Dysfunction and law professor, UT Austin\n\nIs there a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d? We have to define the term before we can discuss its absence or presence.\n\nFirst, one might perceive a crisis if those with official power openly declare their intention to violate the law. James Madison suggested one possible scenario in Federalist 41: \u201cIt is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power\u201d (emphasis added). From this perspective, too-rigid limits on official action builds within it the \u201cnecessary usurpations\u201d required to respond adequately to some great national challenge.\n\nThis suggests the second criterion: legalistic adherence to \u201cconstitutional barriers\u201d even if we accurately recognize that such adherence poses significant threats. Perhaps it makes sense to say \u201clet justice be done though the heavens fall.\u201d But why would we say \u201clet the Constitution, in every respect, be observed though the heavens fall.\u201d\n\nNeither of these conditions is obviously present as we speak. No one in the Trump administration is publicly claiming the right simply to ignore the Constitution, though there are moments when they appear to feel hemmed in by constitutional constraints. One might reduce the current situation to an old-fashioned episode of dueling interpretations of a Constitution that in certain respects is notoriously unclear, including the meaning assigned to the judicially created notion of \u201cexecutive privilege.\u201d\n\nI am prone to arguing that Congress has acquiesced in the creation of a de facto \u201cconstitutional dictatorship\u201d by virtue of its delegation of powers to the executive, seen most clearly at present with regard to the trade war against China. But there is no serious argument that President Donald Trump is \u201cusurping\u201d powers.\n\nA third possible criterion is public unhappiness about the positions taken by one side or another in a constitutional dispute that manifests as demonstrations or episodes of violence \u2014 such as the original Tea Party, or the acts of civil disobedience attached to the civil rights movement. But here, too, we don\u2019t see anything today that could truly be described as direct action that is potentially disrupting everyday life.\n\nSo given all these conditions, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re in a constitutional crisis. But I would add two caveats. First, one must address the extent to which the Constitution itself works to generate what laypeople and pundits might plausibly call \u201ccrises\u201d precisely because a contemporary president can find lawyers who can argue (in more or less good faith) for remarkably expansive and dangerous conceptions of presidential authority.\n\nSecondly, legal academics refuse to take seriously the possibility that Donald Trump himself constitutes a genuine crisis not simply because of some of his political positions, but rather because he is manifestly unfit to be president of the United States.\n\nHamilton, in Federalist 68, assured his readers that the Electoral College would serve as a way of preventing any manifestly unsuitable person from being elected. Those assurances have turned out to be totally false. From his perspective, the Electoral College (in addition to its other deficiencies) has become simply a mode of mob rule. That might suggest another kind of crisis, but that\u2019s a separate conversation.\n\nAziz Huq, law professor, University of Chicago\n\nThe concept of a constitutional crisis is not necessarily a pertinent one in our present circumstances. \u201cCrisis\u201d connotes a sharply defined moment of conflict, in this case over the content of constitutional norms.\n\nBut the experience of other backsliding countries, as Tom Ginsburg and I have demonstrated in our book How to Save a Constitutional Democracy, is not one of a sequence of \u201ccrises.\u201d It is rather a process of slow erosion, often through piecemeal institutional and personnel changes. Far more important than any \u201dcrisis\u201d over a specific subpoena is thus the long-term erosion of Congress\u2019s oversight powers.\n\nAlso important is the ongoing constitutional attack on independent institutions of accountability, such as the independent counsel and the special counsel, under the rubric of \u201cthe unitary executive.\u201d It is these long-term trends that are in fact setting the pace for constitutional democracy\u2019s decline in the United States.\n\nOf course, specific events can crystallize awareness of these trends, but that\u2019s not the same thing as the events being determinative on their own ground.\n\nTom Ginsburg, law professor, University of Chicago\n\nA constitutional crisis is a fight among branches of government in which neither side backs down, and there is no clear resolution within the constitutional system. Crises are dangerous because they tempt players to engage in extraconstitutional action to get their way.\n\nSuppose, for example, that an American president was impeached but refused to leave the White House on the grounds that the Senate trial was not conducted properly. In this example, the crisis might be resolved by the imposition of force \u2014 say, the Capitol Police showing up to arrest the president, or the president using his power as commander in chief to order the US Army to protect him. Whatever side would ultimately triumph would be dictated by force, not by law in any direct way.\n\nThe situation in Venezuela today is a good example of a constitutional crisis. The 2018 reelection of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was disputed, and the National Assembly [the country\u2019s legislative branch] declared that the presidency should be filled in an interim way by the assembly\u2019s leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3.\n\nMaduro\u2019s handpicked Supreme Court, however, ruled the National Assembly declaration unconstitutional and confirmed Maduro as president. Both sides have relied on different constitutional articles to justify their positions, and international actors are divided on which government to support.\n\nA crisis is different from a mere confrontation or disagreement about powers. Take the current fight about investigative authority in the United States: Clearly, both the president and the House of Representatives disagree about the scope of congressional authority. But they have not exhausted the constitutional means of resolving the fight. Congress can use its spending power, or try to enforce any contempt orders it issues; any presidential invocation of executive privilege still needs to be adjudicated.\n\nSo there have been lots of constitutional confrontations in the United States, but we have had very few constitutional crises.\n\nIlya Somin, law professor, George Mason University\n\nWhat counts as a constitutional crisis? Perhaps, as with pornography, the answer is that we know it when we see it. But maybe we can do better. Political scientist Keith Whittington usefully distinguishes between \u201dcrises of fidelity\u201d and \u201coperational crises.\u201d\n\nIn a crisis of fidelity, powerful political actors systematically violate the Constitution, and do it with impunity. A famous historical example is the way in which state governments for decades got away with egregiously violating constitutional restrictions on racial discrimination after the collapse of Reconstruction.\n\nAn operational crisis arises when the existing constitutional rules fail to handle some major challenge facing the nation. Whittington focuses on cases where the system fails to resolve major political disagreements. But an operational crisis can also occur if the system fails to deal with some major danger, whether or not the failure is caused by political conflict. In the years before the Civil War, for example, the system failed to effectively address the monstrous injustice of slavery and the political conflict it generated.\n\nNot every violation of the Constitution qualifies as a crisis of fidelity. Otherwise, we would always be in one, since there has never been perfect compliance. A crisis arises only when there are major, systematic breaches. Similarly, not every policy failure counts as an operational crisis. It has to be a major challenge that the existing system seems chronically incapable of addressing.\n\nAnother type of potential constitutional crisis arises when there is major disagreement over whether the Constitution has been seriously violated or not \u2014 what Sanford Levinson and Jack Balkin call a \u201ctype three\u201d crisis. In periods of severe polarization, like our own, there are often deep divisions about the meaning of the Constitution.\n\nSuch conflict can escalate to a crisis of its own if political leaders on one side adopt major policies they consider legitimate while opponents view them as serious violations of the Constitution. Such a conflict can potentially be resolved by the courts. But that remedy can fail if the issue is not one that can be resolved in court, or if the judicial decision\u2019s own legitimacy is called into serious question.\n\nEven if we avoid crises in the near future, we should also be alert to the threat of more gradual degradation of constitutional rules. Both left and right now claim their opponents are contributing to such rot. And both may have a point.\n\nDiane Marie Amann, law professor, University of Georgia\n\nThe Constitution of the United States was born of crisis \u2014 of a casting-off of authoritarian bonds with no clear vision of what would replace them. It is the product of a moment when Americans dared to promise equality in an unequal world, to prescribe government by the rule of law rather than the whim of one man.\n\nThis 230-year experiment at times has been beset by crises \u2014 by moments when events tore at the fabric of the Constitution\u2019s promise and prescriptions. The abolition of enslavement posed one crisis, the expansion of enfranchisement, another; both efforts are works in progress, as persons of color, women, and others continue to struggle, despite setbacks, for their due place in the American polity.\n\nOn sundry occasions in US history, the president has defied a check that a co-equal branch of the federal government has sought to place on him (to date, the president has always been a man). Such defiance, alone, is confrontation. But confrontation soon will escalate to crisis if the legislative or judicial branch abdicates its duty fully to check unwarranted executive behavior.\n\nIn a succinct statement of the issue, my former boss, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, recently told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cThe president is exercising powers that do not really belong to him. I mean, he has to comply with subpoenas and things like that.\u201d If the president does not, and if no other branch checks his defiance, that, indeed, will be a constitutional crisis.",
