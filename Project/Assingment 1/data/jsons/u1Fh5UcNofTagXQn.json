    "content": "The New York Times published a guest op-ed Sunday , highlighting the Black Lives Matter Movement . Particularly , it focuses on the distinctive use of local community organizing that forgoes the route of ordaining a traditional leader . Barbara Ransby praises the \u201c radical democracy in action \u201d for its work in `` racial and economic justice . '' Despite never going in to the solutions this movement is offering , Ransby posits that it will be far more effective than previous attempts at social change .\nBut what exactly does `` racial and economic justice '' entail ? Well , according to the Movement for Black Lives website , it is nothing but a massive redistribution of wealth .\nIt is clever phrasing because who would oppose racial equality and economic justice ? We all want a fair society . But there are many BLM supporters who do not understand that anti-capitalist agendas are not just attaching themselves to the movement , but are at the forefront .\nBarbara Ransby makes virtually no mention of this fact in the New York Times either . The article explains why the current form of Black Lives Matter is so unique and groundbreaking ,\n`` The Movement for Black Lives is distinctive because it defers to the local wisdom of its members and affiliates , rather than trying to dictate from above . In fact , the local organizers have insisted upon it . This democratic inflection will pay off if they persevere . Brick by brick , relationship by relationship , decision by decision , the edifices of resistance are being built . The national organizations are the mortar between the bricks . That fortified space will be a necessary training ground and refuge for the political battles that lay ahead , as white supremacists inside and outside of our government seek to undermine racial and economic justice . ''\nThe idea behind that model is that when people on the ground make decisions , articulate problems and come up with answers , the results are more likely to meet real needs . And that \u2019 s more sustainable in the long run : People are better prepared to carry out solutions they themselves created , instead of ones handed down by national leaders unfamiliar with realities in local communities . Such local work allows people to take ownership of the political struggles that affect their lives . ''\nDespite saying it is a leaderless group , she notes that `` the Movement for Black Lives , a coalition that includes the Black Lives Matter Global Network and other groups , coalesced in response to high-profile police shootings of black people from 2014 to 2016 '' is considered the central organizing body . But she does not delve into the solutions that are promoted by this group . If she did , she would show that this organization is focused on anything but local control .\nThe Black Lives Matter Movement , officially known as the \u201c Movement for Black Lives \u201d puts forth ideas rooted in the belief that local communities should be in charge of their own decision making . This is a rather Conservative notion . It would be wonderful for all communities to have local control rather than the bureaucracy stemming from Washington , D.C. and state capitals .\nBut , in a convoluted way of promoting that ideal , BLM advocates argue for a large federal government that provides copious economic benefits for past racial injustice . One that is even more so deeply involved in day-to-day life than it is today .\nIt is an entirely debatable point the extent to which past racial discrimination affects current African-American communities . That argument requires far too much insight and depth for this article . However , the suggestted remedies presented by this group show a movement so deeply opposed to American philosophy of limited government and self resopnsibility that it is difficult to take their requests seriously .\nOften times , BLM supporters say that individuals who promote radical economic ideas such as total reparations , free college for all minorities , and other quasi-socialist-communist policies are simply fringe elements of the group . They do not represent the whole . They assert that the group is primarily focused on anti-police violence\nBut according to the Movement for Black Lives website , this could not be further from the truth . The core element of this group is a desire for an overbearing federal government focused on wealth redistribution .\nThe Black Lives Matter movement website is very explicit in calling for large government programs that provide all costs covered for education , not just to black lives but to illegal aliens as well . Funding for this is provided through a restructuring of the tax program that heavily taxes the top earners and then provides massive welfare and subsidies across the nation as reparations .\n`` We seek complete open access for all to free public university , college and technical education programs ( including technology , trade and agricultural ) as well as full-funding for lifelong learning programs that support communities and families . We also seek the forgiveness of all federal student loans . `` Cover all living costs , including but not limited to housing , transportation , childcare , healthcare , and food for students attending public universities , colleges , and technical educational programs ( including technology , trade , and agricultural ) . `` Provide full access to all undocumented people to state and federal programs that provide aid to cover the full costs , including living costs , to attend public universities , and colleges , technical educational programs , and lifelong learning programs . ( Emphasis Added )\nUnder the section labeled `` Economic Justice , '' BLM lays out how exactly they plan on paying for it .\n`` A progressive restructuring of tax codes at the local , state , and federal levels to ensure a radical and sustainable redistribution of wealth . `` Federal and state job programs that specifically target the most economically marginalized Black people , and compensation for those involved in the care economy . Job programs must provide a living wage and encourage support for local workers centers , unions , and Black-owned businesses which are accountable to the community . ''\nIt is puzzling then that they advocate for `` community control . ''\n`` We demand a world where those most impacted in our communities control the laws , institutions , and policies that are meant to serve us \u2013 from our schools to our local budgets , economies , police departments , and our land \u2013 while recognizing that the rights and histories of our Indigenous family must also be respected . ''\nThis sounds inherently conservative . Citizens should be in control of the laws that affect them . Local school boards , police departments , and zoning ordinances should be dealt with by the people they directly affect rather than unelected politicians in Washington .\nMost Americans feel this way . There is common ground between Conservatives and those who identify with the leftist Black Live Matter movement .\nThere are a lot of good , caring citizens in the BLM movement who are concerned with society . The vast majority of those who lend their support are mothers , fathers , brothers , and sisters who just want the next generation to have a better life than they did .
