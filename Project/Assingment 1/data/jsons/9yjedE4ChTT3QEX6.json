Sixty-two percent say they oppose the law , up four points from November .\nNearly all of the newfound opposition is coming from women .\n`` Opposition to Obamacare rose six points among women , from 54 % in November to 60 % now , while opinion of the new law remained virtually unchanged among men , '' CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said . `` That 's bad news for an administration that is reaching out to moms across the country in an effort to make Obamacare a success . ''\nAccording to the survey , 43 % say they oppose the health care law because it is too liberal , with 15 % saying they give the measure a thumbs down because it is not liberal enough . That means half the public either favors Obamacare , or opposes it because it 's not liberal enough , down four points from last month .\nSixty-three percent say they believe the new law will increase the amount of money they personally pay for medical care , which may not be a good sign for a law known as the `` Affordable Care Act .
