Neither the Obama administration nor the insurance companies , however , are promoting the plans vigorously . They believe that many consumers would be better off paying a bit more for a policy that would cover more of the out-of-pocket costs for a doctor \u2019 s visit or hospital stay .\nIn the wake of the federal website problems , there \u2019 s worry about whether the administration can reach its goal of enrolling seven million uninsured Americans in 2014 . Surely the five million to seven million eligible for zero-premium policies would be an easy sell .
