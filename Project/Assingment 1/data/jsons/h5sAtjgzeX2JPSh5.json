Like many Democrats , Jones pointed to diversity and openness to refugees and other immigrants as central components of being American .\n`` There 's so much turmoil in the American political situation right now . People 's ideas of what is America 's place in the world are so different from one end of the spectrum to the other , '' Jones said .\nThere are some points of resounding agreement among Democrats , Republicans and independents about what makes up the country 's identity . Among them : a fair judicial system and rule of law , the freedoms enshrined in the Constitution , and the ability to get good jobs and achieve the American dream .\nBig gulfs emerged between the left and right on other characteristics seen as inherent to America .\nAbout 65 percent of Democrats said a mix of global cultures was extremely or very important to American identity , compared with 35 percent of Republicans . Twenty-nine percent of Democrats saw Christianity as that important , compared with 57 percent of Republicans .\nDemocrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that the ability of people to come to escape violence and persecution is very important , 74 percent to 55 percent . Also , 25 percent of Democrats said the culture of the country 's early European immigrants very important , versus 46 percent of Republicans .\nReggie Lawrence , a 44-year-old Republican in Midland , Texas , who runs a business servicing oil fields , said the country and its Constitution were shaped by Christian values . As those slip away , he said , so does the structure of families , and ultimately , the country 's identity .\n`` If you lose your identity , '' Lawrence said , `` What are we ? We 're not a country anymore . ''\nPatrick Miller , a political science professor at the University of Kansas who studies partisanship and polling , said the results reflect long-standing differences in the U.S. between one camp 's desire for openness and diversity and another 's vision of the country grounded in the white , English-speaking , Protestant traditions of its early settlers .\nThose factions have seen their competing visions of American identity brought to a boil at points throughout history , such as when lawmakers barred Chinese immigration beginning in the 1880s or when bias against Catholic immigrants and their descendants bubbled up through a long stretch of the 20th century .\nThe starkness of the divide and the continuing questions over what it means to be American are a natural byproduct , Miller said , not just of U.S. history , but the current political climate and the rancor of today 's debates over immigration and the welcoming of refugees .\n`` Our sense of identity is almost inseparable from the subject of immigration because it 's how we were built , '' he said . `` Given what we are and how we 've come about , it 's a very natural debate . ''\nThe poll found Democrats were nearly three times as likely as Republicans to say the U.S. should be a country made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive , with far more Republicans saying there should be an essential American culture that immigrants adopt .\nRepublicans overwhelmingly viewed immigrants who arrived in the past decade as having retained their own cultures and values rather than adopting American ones .\nAmong the areas seen as the greatest threats to the American way of life , Democrats coalesce around a fear of the country 's political leaders , political polarization and economic inequality . Most Republicans point instead to illegal immigration as a top concern .\nPerhaps surprisingly , fear of influence from foreign governments was roughly the same on the left and right at a time when calls for an investigation into President Donald Trump 's possible ties to Russia have largely come from Democrats . About 4 in 10 Democrats and Republicans alike viewed the issue as extremely or very threatening .\nTwo questions , also posed during the presidential campaign , offered insight into how Trump 's election may have changed partisans ' views . The poll found about 52 percent of Republicans now regard the U.S. as the single greatest country in the world , up significantly from 35 percent when the question was asked last June .\nSome 22 percent of Democrats expressed that view , essentially unchanged from the earlier poll .\nDemocrats appear to be reinforcing their belief that the country 's range of races , religions and backgrounds make the country stronger .
