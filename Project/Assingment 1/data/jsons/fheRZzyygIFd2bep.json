Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : The first of a two-day confirmation hearing for President-elect Donald Trump \u2019 s controversial attorney general nominee begins today . Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama faces questions from his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee , where he serves as chairman of the immigration subcommittee .\nTrump \u2019 s pick has drawn widespread outrage because of Sessions \u2019 opposition to the Voting Rights Act , support for anti-immigration legislation and history of making racist comments , which included reportedly saying he thought the Ku Klux Klan was , quote , \u201c OK until I found out they smoked pot , \u201d unquote . He \u2019 s also called the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP \u201c un-American \u201d and \u201c Communist-inspired. \u201d Sessions , whose full name is Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III , also called Jeff , is named after Jefferson Davis , president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War , and Civil War General Pierre Beauregard . Those set to testify at Sessions \u2019 hearing Wednesday include civil rights era icon and Democratic Congressman John Lewis and Democratic Senator Cory Booker , marking the first time in Senate history a sitting senator will testify against another sitting senator for a Cabinet post during a confirmation hearing .\nIn 1986 , Sessions was denied confirmation for a federal judgeship by a Republican-controlled Senate committee over his racist comments . This is the late Senator Ted Kennedy speaking at Sessions \u2019 1986 confirmation hearing .\nSEN. TED KENNEDY : Mr . Sessions is a throwback to a shameful era , which I know both black and white Americans thought was in our past . It \u2019 s inconceivable to me that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney , let alone a United States federal judge .\nKEN BODDIE : Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III , he was brought face to face with things he personally had said . For example , that the NAACP and the Civil Liberties Union are un-American organizations .\nJEFF SESSIONS : These comments that you could say about commie organizations or something , I may have said something like that in a general way , and that probably was wrong .\nAMY GOODMAN : Ahead of today \u2019 s hearing , The New York Times slammed Sessions for failing to turn over dozens , if not hundreds , of documents requested by the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2019 s questionnaire . The Huffington Post reported in December Sessions \u2019 submitted questionnaire failed to disclose even the fact he \u2019 d been denied confirmation for the federal judgeship in 1986 . And while the Office of Government Ethics has completed Sessions \u2019 ethics report , The Washington Post reports Sessions failed to disclose he owns oil interests in Alabama\u2014a breach of federal ethics requirements .\nFor more , we go to Washington , D.C. , where we \u2019 re joined by two guests . David Cole is the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union . He is set to testify for the ACLU against Sessions in the Senate hearing on Wednesday . Cole is professor of law and public policy at Georgetown University . His most recent book , Engines of Liberty : The Power of Citizen Activists to Make Constitutional Law . His piece for The New York Review of Books is headlined \u201c Five Questions for Jeff Sessions. \u201d Also with us , Kyle Barry , policy counsel with NAACP Legal Defense Fund , the lead author of their report opposing Jeff Sessions \u2019 nomination .\nWe welcome you both to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! David Cole , what will you be saying on Wednesday in your testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee ? What are your major concerns about Senator Sessions becoming attorney general ?\nDAVID COLE : So , first , Amy , we \u2019 re not actually opposing Senator Sessions \u2019 confirmation , because , as a long-standing policy , the ACLU does not support or endorse nominations . And in fact , we rarely , as a result , testify in hearings . But we chose to testify in this hearing because we have concerns about his fidelity to the rights and interests of virtually all vulnerable groups in this country .\nThere \u2019 s been a lot of talk about his insensitivity to or hostility to voting rights for African Americans and his racially offensive statements and the like . But that \u2019 s just the beginning . This man defended Donald Trump \u2019 s Muslim ban and spoke out very strongly against a resolution that Senator Leahy introduced that would simply have underscored that it is not permissible to use religion as a litmus test for immigration . He has called the Muslim faith a \u201c toxic ideology. \u201d It \u2019 s a faith that millions of Americans abide by . He voted against extending the hate crimes law to women and to gays and lesbians , because , he said , \u201c I just don \u2019 t see that they \u2019 re victims of discrimination. \u201d Now he \u2019 s going to be put in charge of enforcing the hate crimes law . If you can \u2019 t see discrimination , you \u2019 re not going to do a very good job enforcing the laws against discrimination .\nHe \u2019 s abused his office as a prosecutor . Not only did he prosecute voting rights activists for essentially getting out the black vote in Alabama , but he also worked with U.S. Steel , a contributor to his senatorial campaign , to prosecute one of their competitors in a case that was ultimately dismissed by the judge hearing the case as the worst case of prosecutorial misconduct that that judge had ever seen . And now we \u2019 re going to put this man in charge of the most powerful prosecutor \u2019 s office in the United States ?\nSo we think the Senate has an obligation to investigate , to inquire , to get the many questions about Senator Sessions \u2019 record answered before they vote on the confirmation . I think the central question is , look , in 1986 , he wasn \u2019 t qualified to be a local federal judge ; why is he qualified today for a much more powerful post , namely the attorney general of the United States ?\nAMY GOODMAN : That denial , the Senate Judiciary not approving him for that federal judgeship\u2014he was what ? Nominated by President Reagan . Highly unusual . Wasn \u2019 t it only two people , him one of them , in the previous half-century about , 48 years , that did not get through the Senate Judiciary Committee ?\nDAVID COLE : That \u2019 s right , and from the party that controlled the presidency and controlled the Senate at the time , so , you know , very high threshold . And yet , you know , the kinds of statements he made and the kinds of actions he took , I mean , he essentially\u2014when voting rights activists started getting people out to vote , using the Voting Rights Act , which was designed to get people to vote who weren \u2019 t able to vote before , many people treated that as cause for celebration . Jeff Sessions treated it as cause for investigation . And he went out , and his people interviewed black voters throughout Alabama counties and asked them why they voted , how they voted , who brought them to vote , and then prosecuted three civil rights activists for doing nothing more than getting people to the polls and assisting them in their exercising of their constitutional rights . The case was\u2014many of the counts were dismissed outright by the judge as baseless even before trial . He continued nonetheless to go to trial , and all the defendants were acquitted . This , you know\u2014so I think there \u2019 s serious questions\u2014\nDAVID COLE : Exactly . And so , I think those\u2014you know , those questions , serious questions , that were raised by those actions\u2014it \u2019 s not just statements , it \u2019 s actions . I think unless those questions can be answered in a more\u2014you know , in a more understanding and understandable way today than they could back then , then I think the Senate has to take this\u2014its obligation seriously . I know it \u2019 s difficult because he \u2019 s one of their colleagues , but at the end of the day , the question is : Can he be the attorney general for all the American people , and can he protect the rights of the most vulnerable that he is responsible for enforcing ?\nAMY GOODMAN : Speaking of his colleagues , how rare , David Cole , is it that New Jersey Senator Cory Booker will now testify against Jeff Sessions becoming attorney general ? Has this ever happened before in Senate history , a sitting senator testifying against the appointment of another sitting senator ?\nDAVID COLE : Well , not to my knowledge , although I \u2019 m not a historian of the Senate . But I do think it \u2019 s extraordinary . But it reflects just how concerned many people are about the ability of Jeff Sessions to protect the rights of those he \u2019 s being put in charge of protecting .\nAMY GOODMAN : Kyle Barry , you \u2019 re policy counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . You authored the report on Jeff Sessions . Why did you find it necessary to write a report on this nomination in particular ?\nKYLE BARRY : Thanks , Amy . I think one of the first things that people have to remember is that the attorney general is really the chief protector and enforcer of all of our nation \u2019 s civil rights laws , including the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and a host of very important civil rights legislation . And in Jeff Sessions , you have someone who has spent over 40 years of his political and legal career opposing civil rights and opposing principles of equality . And we \u2019 re now entering a time , in the current political climate , in particular , where civil rights will have such an important role really preserving the rule of law in our democracy and , of course , protecting the vulnerable communities that those laws are designed to protect . And so we have very grave concerns that Senator Sessions is someone who can live up to that solemn responsibility .\nAnd , you know , you \u2019 ve been talking about the 1986 hearing and his nomination that was rejected , and what we found in looking at decades of his records since then , including time as state attorney general , time , 20 years , as a United States senator , is that the concerns from the 1980s have been borne out consistently over time . And issue by issue , whether it \u2019 s voting rights or criminal justice or education equality , all these issues that DOJ has a central role in dealing with , Jeff Sessions has opposed civil rights and has opposed principles of equality at every step of the way .\nAMY GOODMAN : Even recently , when Republicans were looking at prison reform , Senator Sessions worked against changes in mandatory minimums . Can you talk about this , also his support of the use of chain gangs ?\nKYLE BARRY : Sure . Yeah , we have very serious concerns about Jeff Sessions \u2019 record on criminal justice in particular . On sentencing reform , he was really an outlier , on the fringe of even his own party , in opposing commonsense reforms to federal sentencing rules , and particularly the use of mandatory minimums , which have shown to be not just discriminatory , particularly against African Americans and Latinos , but also entirely ineffective . And that reform package had the support of Republican leadership , including the Judiciary Committee \u2019 s chairman , Chuck Grassley . And Jeff Sessions led opposition to that , to that reform .\nAnd , you know , particularly horrifying , as you mentioned , when he was a state attorney general in Alabama , he was a very vocal supporter of the use of chain gangs , a practice that had been recently reinstated when he was state attorney general . And he , at the time , praised the use of chain gangs . He seemed to be completely , I think , at best , oblivious to the racial implications , the historical implications in a state like Alabama , with such a long and sordid history of racial discrimination . And to him , the image of chaining prisoners together on the side of public roadways was totally fine for him . And , in fact , he specifically stated that he thought that would not be embarrassing to Alabama , that that would not be an image problem to Alabama and that the practice was perfectly constitutional and proper . And for someone who was then a state attorney general to demonstrate that kind of extraordinary racial insensitivity , I think , to put it lightly , you know , imagine that on a nationwide scale , if he is promoted to the highest law enforcement position in the entire United States . I think that \u2019 s very concerning .\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally , David Cole , you talked about his record 30 years ago , his prosecution , as the U.S. attorney in Alabama , of voting rights activist Albert Turner , his wife Evelyn . Albert Turner had marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther King , considered one of the greatest voting rights activists , got what ? Alabama went from zero to something like 70,000 registered voters , when they were being then prosecuted . Some of his supporters , Sessions \u2019 supporters , say , \u201c That was 30 years ago. \u201d So , in your final response , your overall concerns about today , David Cole ?\nDAVID COLE : So , yeah , that was 30 years ago . But since then , he has voted against lifting felon disenfranchisement , a practice that disproportionally affects African Americans . Since then , he has supported voter ID laws , which suppress the votes of African Americans . Since then , he called the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision in Shelby County , which gutted a central portion of the Voting Rights Act , a good day for the South . And what we know is that that led to the South engaging in racially motivated voter suppression across the country .\nDAVID COLE : And he \u2019 s not just targeted African Americans . When he was asked whether Donald Trump \u2019 s claim that , as a celebrity , he could grab women by the genitals , whether that constituted a description of sexual assault , he said no . So this is a man who is blind , at best , and hostile , at worst , to many of the rights that he is supposed to be enforcing if he becomes attorney general .\nAMY GOODMAN : David Cole , thanks for being with us . You \u2019 ll be testifying tomorrow at the confirmation hearing of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general of the United States . David Cole , national legal director of the ACLU . And Kyle Barry , policy counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . We will link to your report at democracynow.org .\nWhen we come back , we look at the case of the accused airport gunman Esteban Santiago , who could face death penalty charges for killing five people when he opened fire in a crowded airport in Fort Lauderdale on Friday . He was allowed to keep his gun despite walking into the FBI in Alaska , telling them he is being controlled by U.S. intelligence , being institutionalized and then being freed . Stay with us .",
