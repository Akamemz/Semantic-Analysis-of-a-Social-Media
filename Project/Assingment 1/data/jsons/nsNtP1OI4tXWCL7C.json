Iran has denied any involvement .\nUnder the multilateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that the U.S. withdrew from a year ago , Iran can keep no more than 300 kilograms ( 661 pounds ) of uranium enriched no higher than 3.67 % \u2014 far below the 90 % level considered suitable for building nuclear weapons .\nAt a news conference at the Arak Nuclear Complex that was carried live Monday on Iranian television , Behrouz Kamalvandi , a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran , said that stockpile limit could be exceeded within 10 days .\n`` We have quadrupled the rate of enrichment and even increased it more recently , so that in 10 days it will bypass the 300 kg limit , '' Kamalvandi said .\nHe added that his country needs uranium enriched to 5 % for its Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant , built in the 1990s with Russian help , and uranium of 20 % purity to be used as fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor , which the U.S. supplied to Iran in 1967 .\nAlthough not weapons-grade , 20 % purity is generally considered `` highly enriched '' uranium , and as The Associated Press notes , `` going from 20 % to 90 % is a relatively quicker process , something that worries nuclear nonproliferation experts .
