Mrs. Clinton won the overall women \u2019 s vote , 54 percent to 42 percent , reflecting the longstanding gender gap that gives Democratic candidates an edge with female voters . But among voters most like Clinton \u2013 white women \u2013 she lost , 53 percent to 43 percent .\nWhy this happened , and what it tells us about the state of \u201c identity politics , \u201d is instructive .\nLike all voters , women vote the way they do for a host of reasons , including the issue positions , character traits , and experience of the candidates . For some , the prospect of electing the first woman president was deeply meaningful ; for others , not so much . To some women supporters , Clinton \u2019 s gender was even a negative : What if she failed ? That could set women back , said female voters in a focus group last summer .\nIn principle , Americans have long been ready to elect the first woman president . By 1999 , the Gallup poll had found that 92 percent of Americans were willing to vote for a \u201c generally well-qualified woman \u201d for president .\nBut when presented with a real opportunity to put a woman in the Oval Office , millions of women said either \u201c no thanks \u201d or , more emphatically , \u201c no way. \u201d The problem wasn \u2019 t Clinton \u2019 s gender , they said , it was her . In electing the first woman president , it had to be the right woman . And besides , some voters said , women have been shattering glass ceilings in many spheres \u2013 world politics , business , the military \u2013 for a long time .\n\u201c It \u2019 s meaningful \u201d that Clinton is a woman , \u201c but that was 20 or 30 years ago .

Others refused .\nLong before Election Day , political scientist Jennifer Lawless at American University suspected that resistance to Clinton was not for the most part a result of sexism .\n\u201c People have vehement reactions to her in one direction or another , and have for 20 years , \u201d Ms. Lawless , an expert on women and politics , told the Monitor last year . \u201c So I \u2019 ve often said that if people are fundamentally opposed to her , I \u2019 m not convinced that it \u2019 s sexism ; it could be \u2018 Clinton-ism . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Clinton-ism \u201d could be defined as the entire complex of issues surrounding her decades in the public eye .
