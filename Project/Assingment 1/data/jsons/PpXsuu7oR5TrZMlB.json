    "content": "Few self-professed public intellectuals have captured the spirit of the moment like Jordan Peterson , the Canadian clinical pop philosopher whose atavistic advocacy of masculinist revivalism has made him the de facto guru of the right .\nPeterson \u2019 s philosophy \u2014 enumerated in TED talks , YouTube videos for his 1.2 million subscribers , and self-help books ( his latest venture , 12 Rules for Life , topped several best-seller charts ) \u2014 is deceptively simple . Culture , he says , has historically been a battle between order ( traditionally conceived of as masculine ) and chaos ( traditionally feminine ) .\nThe great myths and legends of history , to say nothing of religious narratives , are supposedly rooted in this dichotomy : a dichotomy that humans crave . Our postmodern , post-Marxist ( left-wing , liberal , politically correct ) era has lost touch with this duality . We \u2019 ve become collectively feminized . In an era in which , in Peterson \u2019 s account , boys can \u201c decide to be \u201d girls , women abandon their natural and biological identity as caregivers , and men no longer stand up straight to \u201c be men , \u201d identities and contrast lose their meaning . The clear borders of culture have been dissolved .\nBut if men ( and , by and large , Peterson \u2019 s advice is geared to men ) stand tall , if they clean their rooms , if they embrace order and the kind of performative dominance so ubiquitous in the animal kingdom ( Peterson \u2019 s philosophy is spiked with a heady dose of evolutionary psychology ) , they can somehow get back to this longed-for primordial state . In so doing , the narrative goes , they will rediscover a sense of meaning and purpose the West has lost .\n\u201c In the West , \u201d Peterson writes in 12 Rules , \u201c we have been withdrawing from our tradition- , religion- and even nation-centred cultures . \u201d\nPeterson \u2019 s overarching narrative is one of renewal : make the West great again\nThere is nothing particularly novel or controversial about Peterson \u2019 s theories , which read like a Wikipedia summary of the philosophy of Nietzsche . The Birth of Tragedy traced the cultural tension between the \u201c Apollonian \u201d forces of order and the \u201c Dionysian \u201d ethos of chaos a good century and a half before Peterson .\nBut Peterson \u2019 s public persona has made him far more controversial than his relatively anodyne theories might suggest . After all , he first came to prominence for publicly refusing to use the preferred pronouns of his transgender students . Increasingly , he \u2019 s been associated with his fan base , which includes many on the alt-right , men \u2019 s rights activists , incels , and other reactionary corners of the internet landscape \u2014 though it should be noted that Peterson has often criticized the alt-right , and sees his message of personal responsibility as a path out of it .\nWhat \u2019 s fascinating about Peterson is not the novelty of his ideas , but their power , and the quasi-religious influence he exerts on his followers . In a New York Times profile of Peterson , Nellie Bowles interviews a devotee who sees in Peterson \u2019 s philosophy a kind of grand unifying theory that made him rediscover religion . In Peterson \u2019 s interpretation of biblical stories , he says , he found the truth of his sexual frustration .\n\u201c It made sense in a primordial way when he breaks down Adam and Eve , the snake and chaos , \u201d Bowles quotes her source as saying . \u201c Eve made Adam self-conscious . Women make men self-conscious because they \u2019 re the ultimate judge . I was like , \u2018 Wow this is really true . \u2019 \u201d\nIt \u2019 s easy enough to dismiss Peterson , as some of his critics have done , as catering to the sexual frustrations and perceived loss of status of ( usually ) straight ( usually ) white ( usually ) men . But to do so is dangerous because it overlooks the degree to which Peterson has tapped into something very real , very necessary , and very strong : a legitimate spiritual hunger for meaning that , combined with the eroticized trappings of \u201c countercultural \u201d transgression , alchemize into a heady intellectual cocktail . ( Peterson declined through a representative to be interviewed for this article . )\nThe idea of the \u201c rebellious traditionalist \u201d \u2014 someone who at once hungers for an idealized past and is somehow considered thoroughly punk rock for doing so \u2014 is a perennial one , particularly in reactionary and far-right circles .\nTake Julius Evola , the right-wing Italian philosopher active in the middle of the 20th century and who has been influential to modern right-wing figures , including Steve Bannon . He popularized the capital-T version of Traditionalism as an occult phenomenon : an attempt to recapture what he believed to be a primordial spiritual truth that all world religions had somehow fallen away from . Evola made his reactionary tendencies radical , describing his goals in highly sexualized and countercultural terms ( his most famous book title was the aptly named Revolt Against the Modern World ) .\nWe can see this ethos , too , in a number of reactionary and right-leaning movements today . It \u2019 s inherent , of course , in the very promise of \u201c Make America Great Again , \u201d and those who gleefully pepper the rhetoric of renewal with self-aggrandizing references to being \u201c deplorable. \u201d But it also finds expression in a number of other reactionary movements . The rise of Trad Catholicism ( not to mention Weird Catholic Twitter ) is one example \u2014 one that , for many , is a positive one : an opportunity to find identity through meaningful faith .\nYet we see it , too , in the rise of the alt-right , the \u201c manosphere , \u201d and the myriad intersecting \u2014 and at times intellectually contradictory \u2014 internet sub-movements that , for many of their members , operate as quasi-religions .\nWhen I was interviewing a relatively well-known member of an alt-right Twitter group for an unrelated project a few months ago , he said that his excitement around the community was , in fact , something akin to a religious hunger . Referring to the concept of \u201c meme magic , \u201d the idea that various internet forums \u201c memed \u201d Trump into the presidency , he told me , \u201c It was like the whole world was enchanted . \u201d\nIt is that hunger for enchantment that Peterson capitalizes on so successfully .\nPeterson \u2019 s appeal lies in his ability to speak to a fundamental human need\nTo dismiss Jordan Peterson \u2019 s appeal as just misogyny , or just \u201c straight white male victimhood \u201d ( even as these elements play a major part in his popularity ) , is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of his success . What Peterson understands , and is able to capitalize on , is that people need stories . He understands that the cultural potency of images and myths , and the human need for them , are two of the strongest forces in the world . It is impossible to understand the appeal of any traditionalist or nostalgic movement without recognizing that , for better or for worse , they fulfill a legitimate emotional , aesthetic , and spiritual need .\nThat does not mean that Peterson is right ( the actual content of his self-help book is sufficiently vague and ill-defined that it \u2019 s really impossible to say he \u2019 s right or wrong ) ; nor that we should all become traditional Catholics ; nor ( of course ! ) that the racism , sexism , and outright Nazism that defines so much of the alt-right is excusable .\nHowever , understanding why these kinds of movements are attractive to a wide variety of people who consider themselves , accurately or not , to be disenfranchised demands a serious engagement with the aesthetic and emotional appeal of what , for lack of a better term , I \u2019 ll call traditionalism : largely but not exclusively right-wing movements loosely defined by the rejection of modernity and promise of return to a better time . ( I \u2019 m distinguishing lowercase traditionalism from capital-T Traditionalism , Evola \u2019 s more technically conceived occult movement . )\nThis form of traditionalism is what Peterson talks about when he writes in 12 Rules that \u201c we have been withdrawing from our tradition- , religion- and even nation-centred cultures \u201d and that we must \u201c find sufficient meaning in individual consciousness and experience \u201d by revisiting \u201c the great myths ... of the past . \u201d\nWhat traditionalist movements do , in their various ways , is provide adherents with two sensations . The first is the sense of the mythic . To be a believer is to live in a world of gods and monsters , good and evil , chaos and order . The world has an inherently meaningful and exciting structure .\nThe second is the opportunity to participate in that movement : a participation that blends the security of belonging to a cohesive group with the thrill of cultural transgression . To be a traditionalist is , increasingly , to be countercultural .\nWithout understanding that particular aesthetic appeal of contemporary traditionalism \u2014 that highly specific blend of rigidity and transgression \u2014 it is impossible to fully understand why so many people are drawn to it , and subsequently , all too often , to its handmaidens : sexism , racism , violence .\nLet me declare a few biases here . I \u2019 m a religious Episcopalian Christian , one who instinctively feels an aesthetic connection to what is known as \u201c high church , \u201d \u201c smells and bells \u201d liturgy , and to traditional forms of Catholicism , even as my political views on some social issues put me at odds with elements of Catholic doctrine . As a result , I understand , and empathize with , some of the broader yearnings of traditionalism , even as I reject their right-wing political manifestations . In writing this essay , I neither wish to condemn those who in good faith hunger for meaningfulness nor to condone the far-right political stances into which men like Peterson steer their followers .\nThe hunger for meaning , for surety , for \u201c order \u201d \u2014 to use Peterson \u2019 s well-loved term \u2014 is a legitimate one . So , too , is the aesthetic appeal of perceived counterculturalism : the idealized rebel who defies bourgeois social norms . The irony , of course , is that many of the young straight white men who see themselves as \u201c countercultural \u201d because of their \u201c political incorrectness \u201d are doing little more than reinforcing the status quo .\nBut how is it that right-wing movements capitalize so effectively on both ?\nThe \u201c aesthetic \u201d mode has long been associated with right-wing movements\nSo what am I talking about when I talk about the \u201c aesthetic \u201d appeal of right-wing movements ? German culture critic Walter Benjamin , in his in 1936 essay \u201c The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction , \u201d writes that right-wing movements , which reach their zenith in fascism , represent \u201c the introduction of aesthetics into political life. \u201d While Benjamin is writing about fascism specifically here , his argument encompasses reactionary and right-wing movements more broadly .\nWhile left-wing movements , he writes , work by advocating for \u201c affecting the property structure \u201d of capitalism , right-wing movements offer the masses a chance to \u201c express themselves \u201d while keeping the social order largely intact .\nThe ideal of traditionalist right-wing movements \u2014 which include , but are not limited to , fascist movements \u2014 is a kind of transformation of a person \u2019 s individual life into a mythic story . The narrative of return , the primordial \u201c going back \u201d that defines , say , \u201c make America Great Again \u201d ( or \u201c make Catholicism weird again \u201d ) , is fundamentally an aesthetic one : galvanizing the human desire to live a meaningful story . The imagined past is a place of structure , of significance .\nWe find this taken to extremes in , for example , explicitly fascist movements , which very much operate on this principle . Italian dictator Benito Mussolini , in his 1932 manifesto on fascism , makes his movement sound almost like a religion \u2014 a way for ordinary people to conceive of themselves as belonging to a world of mythic heroes . \u201c Fascism , \u201d he writes , \u201c respects the God of ascetics , saints , and heroes , and it also respects God as conceived by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people , the God to whom their prayers are raised. \u201d Aestheticism , in this context , is the process by which individual political grievances are elevated to the level of myth .\nOf course , this sense of nostalgia is totally ahistoric . History is very rarely as binary as myth , and human beings have been subverting the kind of grand dualistic categories ( masculine versus feminine , chaos versus order ) that Peterson idealizes for exactly as long as they \u2019 ve been around . Peterson devotes a whole section of his book to analyzing the creation narrative in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible as the triumph of rational order , the divine word , over the symbolic \u201c formless deep \u201d of feminine chaos . After an extended discussion of the masculine nature of order and the feminine nature of chaos , Peterson comes to the conclusion that Genesis 1 recounts the \u201c emergence of order from chaos . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not a wrong reading of Genesis 1 , exactly , but it \u2019 s seriously incomplete . The idea of the formation of the world as a result of a battle between order and chaos is , Peterson rightly notes , a common trope .\nIt \u2019 s an idea known to biblical scholars as chaoskampf ( chaos struggle ) , and it has analogues in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths , like the Babylonian Enuma Elish , in which the god Marduk defeats the water goddess Tiamat in order to create the world . Interestingly , Peterson does not cite these . ( Peterson has written about the Enuma Elish elsewhere , although it is absent from his account of Genesis 1 , in 12 Rules , which does not feature historical textual criticism . )\nIt \u2019 s also a dated ( and some scholars would say discredited ) academic idea . For many more contemporary biblical scholars , such as John Day , the authors of Genesis 1 were actively responding to , and rejecting , that chaoskampf tradition as expressed in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths : presenting a God who does not battle against chaos but encompasses it . Day writes frequently on how the writer of Genesis 1 \u201c demythologized \u201d earlier creation narratives ( including the ancient Near Eastern corpus , Psalm 104 , and the Egyptian Hymn to the Aten ) .\nIn other words , the very beginning of the Bible represents a literary subversion of the binary trope Peterson insists has defined human culture .\nNow , Day is far from the only Old Testament scholar out there , and , certainly , biblical scholarship contains differing critical views . But by failing to engage with any of them , Peterson reduces what \u2019 s a very complex matter of biblical interpretation \u2014 one that involves Genesis 1 , as a text , in dialogue and opposition to other ancient Near Eastern creation myths \u2014 to a vague mythic archetype .\nIt \u2019 s just one example of the many ways Peterson has flattened history to fit mythic categories , rather than recognizing that these categories have , historically , always been in flux .\nBut just because these ideas aren \u2019 t historic , or linked to any genuine earlier time , doesn \u2019 t negate the fact that they incredibly powerful . The mythic quality of \u201c order versus chaos , \u201d as a narrative , transcends any place or time . If Peterson , and those like him , are successful at anything , they are successful at realizing just how vital symbolic , mythic categories are to the human experience .\nViktor Frankl , a Holocaust survivor and writer , famously came to the conclusion that a hunger for meaningfulness is at the heart of the human experience . In his best-selling 1946 account of his Holocaust experience , Man \u2019 s Search for Meaning , he posits that his ability to find structure even in the most horrific circumstances allowed him to survive psychologically .\nInsofar as traditionalist ideas can provide a sense of order and meaning , they \u2019 re incredibly effective .\nThe idea of \u201c counterculturalism \u201d is central to the traditionalist narrative\nThere \u2019 s another element to understanding the attraction of contemporary traditionalist movements : sex appeal .\nFrom Jordan Peterson \u2019 s fanboys to the wider alt-right , the idea that traditionalism is inherently countercultural is inextricably bound up with the idea that it \u2019 s somehow sexy , exciting , or a little bit punk . ( As I \u2019 ve previously written , the eroticization of the right wing is a longstanding cultural trope . )\nThere 's a new counterculture emerging on campuses and free speech is at the front lines https : //t.co/pleNcrDW3G \u2014 Jordan B Peterson ( @ jordanbpeterson ) July 5 , 2017\nPeterson makes this dynamic explicit . One of his YouTube lectures is even called \u201c Growing Up and Being Useful is The New Counterculture . \u201d\nTraditionalist movements often sell themselves as countercultural . The modern world ( or so the right-wing narrative often goes ) is corrupt , morally decrepit , decadent , and decayed . Standards have slipped . But by adopting a kind of moral or physical rigidity \u2014 something Peterson frequently demands of his followers , encouraging them to stand up straight or work out more or clear their rooms or take their meds \u2014 the adherent can somehow reject the temptations and vagaries of the modern world . It \u2019 s a curious fusion of orthodoxy and punk : an embrace of older values as a means of putting up the middle finger to contemporary ones .\nThat aesthetic , and the idea of traditionalism as a transgressive , countercultural identity , continues to dominate . Peterson characterizes himself as a warrior , a brave soldier willing to risk life and limb ( or at least career ) in order to ( to use a common right-wing phrase ) \u201c own the libs \u201d and stand up to political correctness . To follow Peterson is thus to be able to participate in the thrill of being transgressive without , well , having to do anything particularly transgressive .\nDemanding a return to patriarchy \u2014 as many in the alt-right , incel , and men \u2019 s rights activists communities have done , and as Peterson himself has done \u2014 aren \u2019 t particularly transgressive behaviors . Indeed , one might say they remain explicitly culturally sanctioned . But the Petersonian narrative is one that allows adherents to identify themselves as dangerous ( even sexy ) transgressive figures without making actual demands on them .\nThe conflation of traditionalism and counterculturalism in its current form became particularly prominent in the late 19th and early 20th century . This was a time when secularism , urbanization , industrialization , and the rise of the urban middle class all served to make nostalgic \u201c traditionalism \u201d more appealing to those who felt themselves to be left behind by these developments .\nIn Europe , England , and America , at least , Catholicism was one of the major canvases on which these tensions played out . The works of writers like Graham Greene , Evelyn Waugh , and ( the Anglican , but very much aesthetically Catholic ) T.S . Eliot all embody these tropes .\nWriting for the progressive Catholic magazine Commonweal , Patrick Baumann notes the abiding popularity among Catholics of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited , by Evelyn Waugh . In that novel \u2019 s denouement , the protagonist Charles \u2019 s love interest , Julia , renounces him , because she , in accordance with Catholic teaching , can not bring herself to remarry after a divorce . Although faith has not been a huge part of her life to this point , and although Julia and Charles would suffer little to no social recourse for doing so , Julia can not bring herself to ignore the \u201c twitch on the thread \u201d : a deep sense of conscience and sin .\nShe turns her back on Charles ( and on a permissive society ) . Charles later converts to Catholicism himself . It \u2019 s a hideous , difficult , and upsetting ending \u2014 from a secular perspective , Julia has made two people miserable for no reason . But it \u2019 s also an intensely powerful one : Julia \u2019 s abnegation is a willful rejection of bourgeois social norms in favor of a higher , harder calling . ( It \u2019 s a thoroughly punk move . )\nSomething of that aesthetic permeates the modern crop of traditionalist Catholics today . The Brideshead argument may have reached its zenith this year when a priest writing for the Catholic magazine First Things defended the 1858 Edgardo Mortara kidnapping \u2014 in which an illicitly baptized Jewish child was removed from his parents under Catholic law \u2014 as an example of the triumph of Catholic doctrine over morality .\nPerhaps nowhere is the Petersonian aesthetic of transgressive traditionalism more apparent than in certain corners of the reactionary internet . Under the wider umbrella of the \u201c alt-right \u201d , a number of reactionary groups \u2014 some explicitly white nationalist or white supremacist , some less clearly defined \u2014 have sprung up , taking the Petersonian ethos to its extreme .\nAmong culturally telling permutations of the wider alt-right Twitter is an internet personality known as Bronze Age Pervert .\nThat \u2019 s not altogether clear . His profile photograph is of an impossibly buff man facing away from the camera . His bio identifies him as an \u201c Aspiring Nudist Bodybuilder . Free speech and anti-xenoestrogen activist. \u201d He \u2019 s been cited to me by a number of sources familiar with the cultural landscape of something of a leadership figure among devotees of Pepe the Frog . He frequently condemns other alt-right figures , such as Richard Spencer , at times suggesting they might be in league with the FBI .\nHis posts veer between retweeting MRA rhetoric about \u201c roasties \u201d ( slang for women with multiple sexual partners ) , claiming that Jordan Peterson plagiarized his suggestion of \u201c enforced monogamy \u201d from him ( in an earlier forum post , he claimed women should be reduced to breeding stock ) , and celebrating on # HandsomeThursdays the physiques of chiseled , muscular Aryan and Slavic men . It \u2019 s not clear , in his internet-slang-laced posts , where performative trolling ends and authentic far-right views begin , nor does it necessarily matter .\nNobody knows who Bronze Age Pervert is . But among a subset of internet denizens , he \u2019 s something of a demigod : a Jordan Peterson in miniature . He was well-known enough for the neoreactionary and proto-alt-right thinker Curtis Yarvin ( better known by his pseudonym , Mencius Moldbug ) to name-check him in a recent interview with an Atlantic journalist , telling Rosie Gray that Bronze Age Pervert was his contact inside the White House . While this seems to have been an attempt to troll Gray , it speaks to Bronze Age Pervert \u2019 s relative notoriety within this tight community .\nAn anonymous follower of his on another neoreactionary blog declared him the leader of the alt-right in language that , though comically over the top , nevertheless speaks to the fundamental mythic tendency of these movements :\nBursting away the built up rust of the last centuries so new myths may be sung . He frees us from the constrictions of historicism and geographism- placing the race question in the light of the Faustian imperial infinity . By having us all take up barbarism the Right is spared from the civcuck middling elements having too much a say ... new culture will be anti-fragile to the attaqs against it , it will soon give us victory . Long live our liege lord .\nIt \u2019 s , of course , ridiculous . But it \u2019 s also illustrative . What Peterson makes implicit , Bronge Age Pervert and his followers make explicit : the intersection of trolling ( complete with language taken straight from Internet memes ) and traditionalism . The traditionalist aesthetic allows for both an embrace of an imagined past \u2014 in which order is triumphant over chaos \u2014 and a thoroughly contemporary assumption of transgression .\nBronze Age Pervert is an embodiment of the strange and effective tension between nostalgia and transgression that makes men like Peterson so popular . His blend of say-anything internet irony , highly eroticized valorization of splendid \u201c warrior \u201d bodies , and atavistic appeals to return to an era when men were real men is as close as you can get to a distillation of the Petersonian essence .\nIn a Twitter DM interview , Bronze Age Pervert told me that he did not call himself a traditionalist \u201c because there \u2019 s no tradition I can think of that I \u2019 m trying to preserve. \u201d He looks , he said , to Homeric and Classical Greek thought , as well as to Tibetan Buddhism , but isn \u2019 t trying to \u201c adopt or revive \u201d them .\n\u201c Most traditions are hostile to beauty and excellence , \u201d he said , although he believes in a \u201c biological hierarchy \u201d that privileges some traditions over others ( he \u2019 s a fan of the French , the Greeks , the Japanese ; he dislikes Ashkenazi Jews ) .\nno usually like contorted pose for physiq display , but I believe he is engaging in yogic position on # HandsomeThursday ... calling forth powers of Left Hand Path pic.twitter.com/CmivNHEIgl \u2014 Bronze Age Pervert ( @ bronzeagemantis ) May 24 , 2018\nHe believes in the \u201c purgation of the corruption of the world and its rejuvenation through an age of barbarism , \u201d and promised to send me his manifesto .\nHe sent me a quote from a tweetbot posting quotes from controversial scholar Camille Paglia about how the \u201c great modernists \u201d \u2014 Joyce , Proust , Woolf , and others \u2014 had \u201c absorbed the great classical tradition , \u201d and thus , \u201c their gestures of rebellion make sense and have power . The power of rebellion comes from the power of tradition. \u201d ( I was unable to substantiate this quote in Paglia \u2019 s work , although it echoes a number of themes common in her writing . ) He denies that he and the rest of the community he calls # FrogTwitter advocate for any particular political project , like , say , a white ethnostate .\nRather , he says , they share a \u201c dissatisfaction with modern life in many ways for the same reasons liberals were dissatisfied before . ... It \u2019 s a world that \u2019 s tightly controlled , repressive , ugly , extremely polluted. \u201d The modern world is an \u201c open-air prison . \u201d\nThe very act of saying absurd or politically correct things , he says , is a form of transgression . \u201c There \u2019 s this completely failed and boring sclerotic establishment , and they deserve to be mocked . \u201d\nYet Bronze Age Pervert \u2019 s lack of interest in historical tradition only intensifies the mythic nature of the ideology he promotes . It \u2019 s traditionalism without a tradition \u2014 a valorization of warrior imagery and mythic heroes in the absence of any historic anchor . When his fans see the images he posts , he says , \u201c Many feel as if they \u2019 ve escaped the gravity of this trash world and returned to a time when the natural beauty of man could be displayed . \u201d\nLet me be clear : I \u2019 m not citing Bronze Age Pervert here because I believe his ideology deserves a platform . However , understanding the popularity of figures like Peterson more generally requires understanding what it looks like when the subtext of these highly aesthetic ideologies is made text . Peterson \u2019 s implicit rhetoric of order and chaos , once distilled , leads us inexorably to # HandsomeThursdays .\nOne of the best books ever written about the appeal of right-wing movements is one that is not explicitly political . It is Muriel Spark \u2019 s 1961 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie . Ostensibly the story of several school girls and their charismatic teacher , the book explores how the titular Miss Brodie \u2014 a canonical fascist and Nazi sympathizer \u2014 corrupts her young charges by making them feel special and clever .\nHer chosen \u201c set \u201d is set apart from ordinary girls . Echoing fascist rhetoric of Mussolini ( whom she admires as a \u201c man ... of action \u201d ) , Miss Brodie promises her students \u201c Goodness , Truth and Beauty \u201d over safety , filling their heads with beautiful and appealing stories of history and art and promising them that they , one day , will ascend into the number of the glorious . In reality , she pushes them into toxic and inappropriate sexual relationships and indirectly causes the death of one of them .\nWhat makes the book so powerful is that it understands the fundamental draw of right-wing traditionalist ideology . It fulfills authentic needs \u2014 for meaningfulness , for a sense of structure \u2014 by providing adherents with a sense of their own \u201c specialness \u201d in a mythic narrative created for them , a specialness further intensified by the highly eroticized thrill of transgression .\nIt is easy , and necessary , to condemn the racism , sexism , and classism that make ideologies like Peterson \u2019 s so popular . But it \u2019 s vital to understand their effectiveness in order to counter it . What Peterson and even Bronze Age Pervert understand is that people fundamentally need stories of meaning , and that in an increasingly secular age , those stories are not necessarily culturally present .",
    "content_original": "Few self-professed public intellectuals have captured the spirit of the moment like Jordan Peterson, the Canadian clinical pop philosopher whose atavistic advocacy of masculinist revivalism has made him the de facto guru of the right.\n\nPeterson\u2019s philosophy \u2014 enumerated in TED talks, YouTube videos for his 1.2 million subscribers, and self-help books (his latest venture, 12 Rules for Life, topped several best-seller charts) \u2014 is deceptively simple. Culture, he says, has historically been a battle between order (traditionally conceived of as masculine) and chaos (traditionally feminine).\n\nThe great myths and legends of history, to say nothing of religious narratives, are supposedly rooted in this dichotomy: a dichotomy that humans crave. Our postmodern, post-Marxist (left-wing, liberal, politically correct) era has lost touch with this duality. We\u2019ve become collectively feminized. In an era in which, in Peterson\u2019s account, boys can \u201cdecide to be\u201d girls, women abandon their natural and biological identity as caregivers, and men no longer stand up straight to \u201cbe men,\u201d identities and contrast lose their meaning. The clear borders of culture have been dissolved.\n\nBut if men (and, by and large, Peterson\u2019s advice is geared to men) stand tall, if they clean their rooms, if they embrace order and the kind of performative dominance so ubiquitous in the animal kingdom (Peterson\u2019s philosophy is spiked with a heady dose of evolutionary psychology), they can somehow get back to this longed-for primordial state. In so doing, the narrative goes, they will rediscover a sense of meaning and purpose the West has lost.\n\n\u201cIn the West,\u201d Peterson writes in 12 Rules, \u201cwe have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures.\u201d\n\nPeterson\u2019s overarching narrative is one of renewal: make the West great again\n\nThere is nothing particularly novel or controversial about Peterson\u2019s theories, which read like a Wikipedia summary of the philosophy of Nietzsche. The Birth of Tragedy traced the cultural tension between the \u201cApollonian\u201d forces of order and the \u201cDionysian\u201d ethos of chaos a good century and a half before Peterson.\n\nBut Peterson\u2019s public persona has made him far more controversial than his relatively anodyne theories might suggest. After all, he first came to prominence for publicly refusing to use the preferred pronouns of his transgender students. Increasingly, he\u2019s been associated with his fan base, which includes many on the alt-right, men\u2019s rights activists, incels, and other reactionary corners of the internet landscape \u2014 though it should be noted that Peterson has often criticized the alt-right, and sees his message of personal responsibility as a path out of it.\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about Peterson is not the novelty of his ideas, but their power, and the quasi-religious influence he exerts on his followers. In a New York Times profile of Peterson, Nellie Bowles interviews a devotee who sees in Peterson\u2019s philosophy a kind of grand unifying theory that made him rediscover religion. In Peterson\u2019s interpretation of biblical stories, he says, he found the truth of his sexual frustration.\n\n\u201cIt made sense in a primordial way when he breaks down Adam and Eve, the snake and chaos,\u201d Bowles quotes her source as saying. \u201cEve made Adam self-conscious. Women make men self-conscious because they\u2019re the ultimate judge. I was like, \u2018Wow this is really true.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to dismiss Peterson, as some of his critics have done, as catering to the sexual frustrations and perceived loss of status of (usually) straight (usually) white (usually) men. But to do so is dangerous because it overlooks the degree to which Peterson has tapped into something very real, very necessary, and very strong: a legitimate spiritual hunger for meaning that, combined with the eroticized trappings of \u201ccountercultural\u201d transgression, alchemize into a heady intellectual cocktail. (Peterson declined through a representative to be interviewed for this article.)\n\nThe idea of the \u201crebellious traditionalist\u201d \u2014 someone who at once hungers for an idealized past and is somehow considered thoroughly punk rock for doing so \u2014 is a perennial one, particularly in reactionary and far-right circles.\n\nTake Julius Evola, the right-wing Italian philosopher active in the middle of the 20th century and who has been influential to modern right-wing figures, including Steve Bannon. He popularized the capital-T version of Traditionalism as an occult phenomenon: an attempt to recapture what he believed to be a primordial spiritual truth that all world religions had somehow fallen away from. Evola made his reactionary tendencies radical, describing his goals in highly sexualized and countercultural terms (his most famous book title was the aptly named Revolt Against the Modern World).\n\nWe can see this ethos, too, in a number of reactionary and right-leaning movements today. It\u2019s inherent, of course, in the very promise of \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d and those who gleefully pepper the rhetoric of renewal with self-aggrandizing references to being \u201cdeplorable.\u201d But it also finds expression in a number of other reactionary movements. The rise of Trad Catholicism (not to mention Weird Catholic Twitter) is one example \u2014 one that, for many, is a positive one: an opportunity to find identity through meaningful faith.\n\nYet we see it, too, in the rise of the alt-right, the \u201cmanosphere,\u201d and the myriad intersecting \u2014 and at times intellectually contradictory \u2014 internet sub-movements that, for many of their members, operate as quasi-religions.\n\nWhen I was interviewing a relatively well-known member of an alt-right Twitter group for an unrelated project a few months ago, he said that his excitement around the community was, in fact, something akin to a religious hunger. Referring to the concept of \u201cmeme magic,\u201d the idea that various internet forums \u201cmemed\u201d Trump into the presidency, he told me, \u201cIt was like the whole world was enchanted.\u201d\n\nIt is that hunger for enchantment that Peterson capitalizes on so successfully.\n\nPeterson\u2019s appeal lies in his ability to speak to a fundamental human need\n\nTo dismiss Jordan Peterson\u2019s appeal as just misogyny, or just \u201cstraight white male victimhood\u201d (even as these elements play a major part in his popularity), is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of his success. What Peterson understands, and is able to capitalize on, is that people need stories. He understands that the cultural potency of images and myths, and the human need for them, are two of the strongest forces in the world. It is impossible to understand the appeal of any traditionalist or nostalgic movement without recognizing that, for better or for worse, they fulfill a legitimate emotional, aesthetic, and spiritual need.\n\nThat does not mean that Peterson is right (the actual content of his self-help book is sufficiently vague and ill-defined that it\u2019s really impossible to say he\u2019s right or wrong); nor that we should all become traditional Catholics; nor (of course!) that the racism, sexism, and outright Nazism that defines so much of the alt-right is excusable.\n\nHowever, understanding why these kinds of movements are attractive to a wide variety of people who consider themselves, accurately or not, to be disenfranchised demands a serious engagement with the aesthetic and emotional appeal of what, for lack of a better term, I\u2019ll call traditionalism: largely but not exclusively right-wing movements loosely defined by the rejection of modernity and promise of return to a better time. (I\u2019m distinguishing lowercase traditionalism from capital-T Traditionalism, Evola\u2019s more technically conceived occult movement.)\n\nThis form of traditionalism is what Peterson talks about when he writes in 12 Rules that \u201cwe have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures\u201d and that we must \u201cfind sufficient meaning in individual consciousness and experience\u201d by revisiting \u201cthe great myths ... of the past.\u201d\n\nWhat traditionalist movements do, in their various ways, is provide adherents with two sensations. The first is the sense of the mythic. To be a believer is to live in a world of gods and monsters, good and evil, chaos and order. The world has an inherently meaningful and exciting structure.\n\nThe second is the opportunity to participate in that movement: a participation that blends the security of belonging to a cohesive group with the thrill of cultural transgression. To be a traditionalist is, increasingly, to be countercultural.\n\nWithout understanding that particular aesthetic appeal of contemporary traditionalism \u2014 that highly specific blend of rigidity and transgression \u2014 it is impossible to fully understand why so many people are drawn to it, and subsequently, all too often, to its handmaidens: sexism, racism, violence.\n\nLet me declare a few biases here. I\u2019m a religious Episcopalian Christian, one who instinctively feels an aesthetic connection to what is known as \u201chigh church,\u201d \u201csmells and bells\u201d liturgy, and to traditional forms of Catholicism, even as my political views on some social issues put me at odds with elements of Catholic doctrine. As a result, I understand, and empathize with, some of the broader yearnings of traditionalism, even as I reject their right-wing political manifestations. In writing this essay, I neither wish to condemn those who in good faith hunger for meaningfulness nor to condone the far-right political stances into which men like Peterson steer their followers.\n\nThe hunger for meaning, for surety, for \u201corder\u201d \u2014 to use Peterson\u2019s well-loved term \u2014 is a legitimate one. So, too, is the aesthetic appeal of perceived counterculturalism: the idealized rebel who defies bourgeois social norms. The irony, of course, is that many of the young straight white men who see themselves as \u201ccountercultural\u201d because of their \u201cpolitical incorrectness\u201d are doing little more than reinforcing the status quo.\n\nBut how is it that right-wing movements capitalize so effectively on both?\n\nThe \u201caesthetic\u201d mode has long been associated with right-wing movements\n\nSo what am I talking about when I talk about the \u201caesthetic\u201d appeal of right-wing movements? German culture critic Walter Benjamin, in his in 1936 essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d writes that right-wing movements, which reach their zenith in fascism, represent \u201cthe introduction of aesthetics into political life.\u201d While Benjamin is writing about fascism specifically here, his argument encompasses reactionary and right-wing movements more broadly.\n\nWhile left-wing movements, he writes, work by advocating for \u201caffecting the property structure\u201d of capitalism, right-wing movements offer the masses a chance to \u201cexpress themselves\u201d while keeping the social order largely intact.\n\nThe ideal of traditionalist right-wing movements \u2014 which include, but are not limited to, fascist movements \u2014 is a kind of transformation of a person\u2019s individual life into a mythic story. The narrative of return, the primordial \u201cgoing back\u201d that defines, say, \u201cmake America Great Again\u201d (or \u201cmake Catholicism weird again\u201d), is fundamentally an aesthetic one: galvanizing the human desire to live a meaningful story. The imagined past is a place of structure, of significance.\n\nWe find this taken to extremes in, for example, explicitly fascist movements, which very much operate on this principle. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in his 1932 manifesto on fascism, makes his movement sound almost like a religion \u2014 a way for ordinary people to conceive of themselves as belonging to a world of mythic heroes. \u201cFascism,\u201d he writes, \u201crespects the God of ascetics, saints, and heroes, and it also respects God as conceived by the ingenuous and primitive heart of the people, the God to whom their prayers are raised.\u201d Aestheticism, in this context, is the process by which individual political grievances are elevated to the level of myth.\n\nOf course, this sense of nostalgia is totally ahistoric. History is very rarely as binary as myth, and human beings have been subverting the kind of grand dualistic categories (masculine versus feminine, chaos versus order) that Peterson idealizes for exactly as long as they\u2019ve been around. Peterson devotes a whole section of his book to analyzing the creation narrative in the first chapter of Genesis in the Bible as the triumph of rational order, the divine word, over the symbolic \u201cformless deep\u201d of feminine chaos. After an extended discussion of the masculine nature of order and the feminine nature of chaos, Peterson comes to the conclusion that Genesis 1 recounts the \u201cemergence of order from chaos.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a wrong reading of Genesis 1, exactly, but it\u2019s seriously incomplete. The idea of the formation of the world as a result of a battle between order and chaos is, Peterson rightly notes, a common trope.\n\nIt\u2019s an idea known to biblical scholars as chaoskampf (chaos struggle), and it has analogues in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths, like the Babylonian Enuma Elish, in which the god Marduk defeats the water goddess Tiamat in order to create the world. Interestingly, Peterson does not cite these. (Peterson has written about the Enuma Elish elsewhere, although it is absent from his account of Genesis 1, in 12 Rules, which does not feature historical textual criticism.)\n\nIt\u2019s also a dated (and some scholars would say discredited) academic idea. For many more contemporary biblical scholars, such as John Day, the authors of Genesis 1 were actively responding to, and rejecting, that chaoskampf tradition as expressed in other ancient Near Eastern creation myths: presenting a God who does not battle against chaos but encompasses it. Day writes frequently on how the writer of Genesis 1 \u201cdemythologized\u201d earlier creation narratives (including the ancient Near Eastern corpus, Psalm 104, and the Egyptian Hymn to the Aten).\n\nIn other words, the very beginning of the Bible represents a literary subversion of the binary trope Peterson insists has defined human culture.\n\nNow, Day is far from the only Old Testament scholar out there, and, certainly, biblical scholarship contains differing critical views. But by failing to engage with any of them, Peterson reduces what\u2019s a very complex matter of biblical interpretation \u2014 one that involves Genesis 1, as a text, in dialogue and opposition to other ancient Near Eastern creation myths \u2014 to a vague mythic archetype.\n\nIt\u2019s just one example of the many ways Peterson has flattened history to fit mythic categories, rather than recognizing that these categories have, historically, always been in flux.\n\nBut just because these ideas aren\u2019t historic, or linked to any genuine earlier time, doesn\u2019t negate the fact that they incredibly powerful. The mythic quality of \u201corder versus chaos,\u201d as a narrative, transcends any place or time. If Peterson, and those like him, are successful at anything, they are successful at realizing just how vital symbolic, mythic categories are to the human experience.\n\nViktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and writer, famously came to the conclusion that a hunger for meaningfulness is at the heart of the human experience. In his best-selling 1946 account of his Holocaust experience, Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, he posits that his ability to find structure even in the most horrific circumstances allowed him to survive psychologically.\n\nInsofar as traditionalist ideas can provide a sense of order and meaning, they\u2019re incredibly effective.\n\nThe idea of \u201ccounterculturalism\u201d is central to the traditionalist narrative\n\nThere\u2019s another element to understanding the attraction of contemporary traditionalist movements: sex appeal.\n\nFrom Jordan Peterson\u2019s fanboys to the wider alt-right, the idea that traditionalism is inherently countercultural is inextricably bound up with the idea that it\u2019s somehow sexy, exciting, or a little bit punk. (As I\u2019ve previously written, the eroticization of the right wing is a longstanding cultural trope.)\n\nThere's a new counterculture emerging on campuses and free speech is at the front lines https://t.co/pleNcrDW3G \u2014 Jordan B Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) July 5, 2017\n\nPeterson makes this dynamic explicit. One of his YouTube lectures is even called \u201cGrowing Up and Being Useful is The New Counterculture.\u201d\n\nTraditionalist movements often sell themselves as countercultural. The modern world (or so the right-wing narrative often goes) is corrupt, morally decrepit, decadent, and decayed. Standards have slipped. But by adopting a kind of moral or physical rigidity \u2014 something Peterson frequently demands of his followers, encouraging them to stand up straight or work out more or clear their rooms or take their meds \u2014 the adherent can somehow reject the temptations and vagaries of the modern world. It\u2019s a curious fusion of orthodoxy and punk: an embrace of older values as a means of putting up the middle finger to contemporary ones.\n\nThat aesthetic, and the idea of traditionalism as a transgressive, countercultural identity, continues to dominate. Peterson characterizes himself as a warrior, a brave soldier willing to risk life and limb (or at least career) in order to (to use a common right-wing phrase) \u201cown the libs\u201d and stand up to political correctness. To follow Peterson is thus to be able to participate in the thrill of being transgressive without, well, having to do anything particularly transgressive.\n\nDemanding a return to patriarchy \u2014 as many in the alt-right, incel, and men\u2019s rights activists communities have done, and as Peterson himself has done \u2014 aren\u2019t particularly transgressive behaviors. Indeed, one might say they remain explicitly culturally sanctioned. But the Petersonian narrative is one that allows adherents to identify themselves as dangerous (even sexy) transgressive figures without making actual demands on them.\n\nThe alt-right aesthetic isn\u2019t limited to Peterson\n\nThe conflation of traditionalism and counterculturalism in its current form became particularly prominent in the late 19th and early 20th century. This was a time when secularism, urbanization, industrialization, and the rise of the urban middle class all served to make nostalgic \u201ctraditionalism\u201d more appealing to those who felt themselves to be left behind by these developments.\n\nIn Europe, England, and America, at least, Catholicism was one of the major canvases on which these tensions played out. The works of writers like Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, and (the Anglican, but very much aesthetically Catholic) T.S. Eliot all embody these tropes.\n\nWriting for the progressive Catholic magazine Commonweal, Patrick Baumann notes the abiding popularity among Catholics of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited, by Evelyn Waugh. In that novel\u2019s denouement, the protagonist Charles\u2019s love interest, Julia, renounces him, because she, in accordance with Catholic teaching, cannot bring herself to remarry after a divorce. Although faith has not been a huge part of her life to this point, and although Julia and Charles would suffer little to no social recourse for doing so, Julia cannot bring herself to ignore the \u201ctwitch on the thread\u201d: a deep sense of conscience and sin.\n\nShe turns her back on Charles (and on a permissive society). Charles later converts to Catholicism himself. It\u2019s a hideous, difficult, and upsetting ending \u2014 from a secular perspective, Julia has made two people miserable for no reason. But it\u2019s also an intensely powerful one: Julia\u2019s abnegation is a willful rejection of bourgeois social norms in favor of a higher, harder calling. (It\u2019s a thoroughly punk move.)\n\nSomething of that aesthetic permeates the modern crop of traditionalist Catholics today. The Brideshead argument may have reached its zenith this year when a priest writing for the Catholic magazine First Things defended the 1858 Edgardo Mortara kidnapping \u2014 in which an illicitly baptized Jewish child was removed from his parents under Catholic law \u2014 as an example of the triumph of Catholic doctrine over morality.\n\nPerhaps nowhere is the Petersonian aesthetic of transgressive traditionalism more apparent than in certain corners of the reactionary internet. Under the wider umbrella of the \u201calt-right\u201d, a number of reactionary groups \u2014 some explicitly white nationalist or white supremacist, some less clearly defined \u2014 have sprung up, taking the Petersonian ethos to its extreme.\n\nAmong culturally telling permutations of the wider alt-right Twitter is an internet personality known as Bronze Age Pervert.\n\nWho is Bronze Age Pervert?\n\nThat\u2019s not altogether clear. His profile photograph is of an impossibly buff man facing away from the camera. His bio identifies him as an \u201cAspiring Nudist Bodybuilder. Free speech and anti-xenoestrogen activist.\u201d He\u2019s been cited to me by a number of sources familiar with the cultural landscape of something of a leadership figure among devotees of Pepe the Frog. He frequently condemns other alt-right figures, such as Richard Spencer, at times suggesting they might be in league with the FBI.\n\nHis posts veer between retweeting MRA rhetoric about \u201croasties\u201d (slang for women with multiple sexual partners), claiming that Jordan Peterson plagiarized his suggestion of \u201cenforced monogamy\u201d from him (in an earlier forum post, he claimed women should be reduced to breeding stock), and celebrating on #HandsomeThursdays the physiques of chiseled, muscular Aryan and Slavic men. It\u2019s not clear, in his internet-slang-laced posts, where performative trolling ends and authentic far-right views begin, nor does it necessarily matter.\n\nNobody knows who Bronze Age Pervert is. But among a subset of internet denizens, he\u2019s something of a demigod: a Jordan Peterson in miniature. He was well-known enough for the neoreactionary and proto-alt-right thinker Curtis Yarvin (better known by his pseudonym, Mencius Moldbug) to name-check him in a recent interview with an Atlantic journalist, telling Rosie Gray that Bronze Age Pervert was his contact inside the White House. While this seems to have been an attempt to troll Gray, it speaks to Bronze Age Pervert\u2019s relative notoriety within this tight community.\n\nAn anonymous follower of his on another neoreactionary blog declared him the leader of the alt-right in language that, though comically over the top, nevertheless speaks to the fundamental mythic tendency of these movements:\n\nBursting away the built up rust of the last centuries so new myths may be sung. He frees us from the constrictions of historicism and geographism- placing the race question in the light of the Faustian imperial infinity. By having us all take up barbarism the Right is spared from the civcuck middling elements having too much a say ... new culture will be anti-fragile to the attaqs against it, it will soon give us victory. Long live our liege lord.\n\nIt\u2019s, of course, ridiculous. But it\u2019s also illustrative. What Peterson makes implicit, Bronge Age Pervert and his followers make explicit: the intersection of trolling (complete with language taken straight from Internet memes) and traditionalism. The traditionalist aesthetic allows for both an embrace of an imagined past \u2014 in which order is triumphant over chaos \u2014 and a thoroughly contemporary assumption of transgression.\n\nBronze Age Pervert is an embodiment of the strange and effective tension between nostalgia and transgression that makes men like Peterson so popular. His blend of say-anything internet irony, highly eroticized valorization of splendid \u201cwarrior\u201d bodies, and atavistic appeals to return to an era when men were real men is as close as you can get to a distillation of the Petersonian essence.\n\nIn one tweet, Bronze Age Pervert posts a painting of a naked wood nymph with a thoroughly Nietzschean caption: \u201creturn of the maenads ...... imagine being torn limb from limb by crazed bacchant-gril as irregular drums beat and very thin, circular demented melody plays on two flutes handled by goat-men ... I want such death.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter DM interview, Bronze Age Pervert told me that he did not call himself a traditionalist \u201cbecause there\u2019s no tradition I can think of that I\u2019m trying to preserve.\u201d He looks, he said, to Homeric and Classical Greek thought, as well as to Tibetan Buddhism, but isn\u2019t trying to \u201cadopt or revive\u201d them.\n\n\u201cMost traditions are hostile to beauty and excellence,\u201d he said, although he believes in a \u201cbiological hierarchy\u201d that privileges some traditions over others (he\u2019s a fan of the French, the Greeks, the Japanese; he dislikes Ashkenazi Jews).\n\nno usually like contorted pose for physiq display, but I believe he is engaging in yogic position on #HandsomeThursday ...calling forth powers of Left Hand Path pic.twitter.com/CmivNHEIgl \u2014 Bronze Age Pervert (@bronzeagemantis) May 24, 2018\n\nHe believes in the \u201cpurgation of the corruption of the world and its rejuvenation through an age of barbarism,\u201d and promised to send me his manifesto.\n\nHe sent me a quote from a tweetbot posting quotes from controversial scholar Camille Paglia about how the \u201cgreat modernists\u201d \u2014 Joyce, Proust, Woolf, and others \u2014 had \u201cabsorbed the great classical tradition,\u201d and thus, \u201ctheir gestures of rebellion make sense and have power. The power of rebellion comes from the power of tradition.\u201d (I was unable to substantiate this quote in Paglia\u2019s work, although it echoes a number of themes common in her writing.) He denies that he and the rest of the community he calls #FrogTwitter advocate for any particular political project, like, say, a white ethnostate.\n\nRather, he says, they share a \u201cdissatisfaction with modern life in many ways for the same reasons liberals were dissatisfied before. ... It\u2019s a world that\u2019s tightly controlled, repressive, ugly, extremely polluted.\u201d The modern world is an \u201copen-air prison.\u201d\n\nThe very act of saying absurd or politically correct things, he says, is a form of transgression. \u201cThere\u2019s this completely failed and boring sclerotic establishment, and they deserve to be mocked.\u201d\n\nYet Bronze Age Pervert\u2019s lack of interest in historical tradition only intensifies the mythic nature of the ideology he promotes. It\u2019s traditionalism without a tradition \u2014 a valorization of warrior imagery and mythic heroes in the absence of any historic anchor. When his fans see the images he posts, he says, \u201cMany feel as if they\u2019ve escaped the gravity of this trash world and returned to a time when the natural beauty of man could be displayed.\u201d\n\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m not citing Bronze Age Pervert here because I believe his ideology deserves a platform. However, understanding the popularity of figures like Peterson more generally requires understanding what it looks like when the subtext of these highly aesthetic ideologies is made text. Peterson\u2019s implicit rhetoric of order and chaos, once distilled, leads us inexorably to #HandsomeThursdays.\n\nOne of the best books ever written about the appeal of right-wing movements is one that is not explicitly political. It is Muriel Spark\u2019s 1961 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. Ostensibly the story of several school girls and their charismatic teacher, the book explores how the titular Miss Brodie \u2014 a canonical fascist and Nazi sympathizer \u2014 corrupts her young charges by making them feel special and clever.\n\nHer chosen \u201cset\u201d is set apart from ordinary girls. Echoing fascist rhetoric of Mussolini (whom she admires as a \u201cman ... of action\u201d), Miss Brodie promises her students \u201cGoodness, Truth and Beauty\u201d over safety, filling their heads with beautiful and appealing stories of history and art and promising them that they, one day, will ascend into the number of the glorious. In reality, she pushes them into toxic and inappropriate sexual relationships and indirectly causes the death of one of them.\n\nWhat makes the book so powerful is that it understands the fundamental draw of right-wing traditionalist ideology. It fulfills authentic needs \u2014 for meaningfulness, for a sense of structure \u2014 by providing adherents with a sense of their own \u201cspecialness\u201d in a mythic narrative created for them, a specialness further intensified by the highly eroticized thrill of transgression.\n\nIt is easy, and necessary, to condemn the racism, sexism, and classism that make ideologies like Peterson\u2019s so popular. But it\u2019s vital to understand their effectiveness in order to counter it. What Peterson and even Bronze Age Pervert understand is that people fundamentally need stories of meaning, and that in an increasingly secular age, those stories are not necessarily culturally present.\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame we don\u2019t have better storytellers.",
