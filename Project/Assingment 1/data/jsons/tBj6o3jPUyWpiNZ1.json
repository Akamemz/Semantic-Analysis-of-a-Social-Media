Ms. Tang and other \u201c hacktivists \u201d \u2013 tech-savvy activists who design their own solutions to government issues \u2013 set up communications and transmitted the debate to millions of people .\nThe movement won broad public support , helping prompt a change in government in 2016 with the election of President Tsai Ing-wen . Protests morphed into sustained participation , as \u201c hactivists \u201d joined the government . President Tsai \u2019 s administration recruited dozens of young social entrepreneurs and innovators to serve as \u201c reverse mentors \u201d for older ministers , and to broaden public engagement .
