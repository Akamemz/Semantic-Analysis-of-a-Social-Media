    "content": "Transcript of New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie 's keynote speech as prepared for delivery at the Republican National Convention .\nThis stage and this moment are very improbable for me .\nA New Jersey Republican delivering the keynote address to our national convention , from a state with 700,000 more Democrats than Republicans .\nProud of my party , proud of my state and proud of my country .\nI am the son of an Irish father and a Sicilian mother .\nMy Dad , who I am blessed to have with me here tonight , is gregarious , outgoing and loveable .\nMy Mom , who I lost eight years ago , was the enforcer . She made sure we all knew who set the rules .\nIn the automobile of life , Dad was just a passenger . Mom was the driver .\nThey both lived hard lives . Dad grew up in poverty . After returning from Army service , he worked at the Breyers Ice Cream plant in the 1950s . With that job and the G.I . bill he put himself through Rutgers University at night to become the first in his family to earn a college degree . Our first family picture was on his graduation day , with Mom beaming next to him , six months pregnant with me .\nMom also came from nothing . She was raised by a single mother who took three buses to get to work every day . And mom spent the time she was supposed to be a kid actually raising children \u2013 her two younger siblings . She was tough as nails and did n't suffer fools at all . The truth was she could n't afford to . She spoke the truth \u2013 bluntly , directly and without much varnish .\nI was her son as I listened to `` Darkness on the Edge of Town '' with my high school friends on the Jersey Shore .\nI was her son as I moved into a studio apartment with Mary Pat to start a marriage that is now 26 years old .\nI was her son as I coached our sons Andrew and Patrick on the fields of Mendham , and as I watched with pride as our daughters Sarah and Bridget marched with their soccer teams in the Labor Day parade .\nAnd I am still her son today , as governor , following the rules she taught me : to speak from the heart and to fight for your principles . She never thought you get extra credit for just speaking the truth .\nThe greatest lesson Mom ever taught me , though , was this one : she told me there would be times in your life when you have to choose between being loved and being respected . She said to always pick being respected , that love without respect was always fleeting \u2014 but that respect could grow into real , lasting love .\nBut I have learned over time that it applies just as much to leadership . In fact , I think that advice applies to America today more than ever .\nI believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved .\nOur Founding Fathers had the wisdom to know that social acceptance and popularity is fleeting and that this country 's principles needed to be rooted in strengths greater than the passions and emotions of the times .\nOur leaders today have decided it is more important to be popular , to do what is easy and say `` yes , '' rather than to say no when `` no '' is what 's required .\nIn recent years , we as a country have too often chosen the same path .\nIt 's been easy for our leaders to say not us , and not now , in taking on the tough issues . And we 've stood silently by and let them get away with it .\nI say , together , let 's make a much different choice . Tonight , we are speaking up for ourselves and stepping up .\nWe are beginning to do what is right and what is necessary to make our country great again .\nWe are demanding that our leaders stop tearing each other down , and work together to take action on the big things facing America .\nWe are not afraid . We are taking our country back .\nWe are the great grandchildren of men and women who broke their backs in the name of American ingenuity ; the grandchildren of the Greatest Generation ; the sons and daughters of immigrants ; the brothers and sisters of everyday heroes ; the neighbors of entrepreneurs and firefighters , teachers and farmers , veterans and factory workers and everyone in-between who shows up not just on the big days or the good days , but on the bad days and on the hard days .\nNow we must lead the way our citizens live . To lead as my mother insisted I live , not by avoiding truths , especially the hard ones , but by facing up to them and being the better for it .\nI know because this was the challenge in New Jersey .\nWhen I came into office , I could continue on the same path that led to wealth , jobs and people leaving the state or I could do the job the people elected me to do \u2013 to do the big things .\nThere were those who said it could n't be done . The problems were too big , too politically charged , too broken to fix . But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow .\nThey said it was impossible to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years . That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time , with an $ 11 billion deficit . Three years later , we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes .\nThey said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics . To take on the public sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefit system that was headed to bankruptcy .\nWith bipartisan leadership we saved taxpayers $ 132 billion over 30 years and saved retirees their pension .\nThey said it was impossible to speak the truth to the teachers union . They were just too powerful . Real teacher tenure reform that demands accountability and ends the guarantee of a job for life regardless of performance would never happen .\nFor the first time in 100 years with bipartisan support , we did it .\nThe disciples of yesterday 's politics underestimated the will of the people . They assumed our people were selfish ; that when told of the difficult problems , tough choices and complicated solutions , they would simply turn their backs , that they would decide it was every man for himself .\nInstead , the people of New Jersey stepped up and shared in the sacrifice .\nThey rewarded politicians who led instead of politicians who pandered .\nWe 've never been a country to shy away from the truth . History shows that we stand up when it counts and it 's this quality that has defined our character and our significance in the world .\nI know this simple truth and I 'm not afraid to say it : our ideas are right for America and their ideas have failed America .\nLet 's be clear with the American people tonight . Here 's what we believe as Republicans and what they believe as Democrats .\nWe believe in telling hard working families the truth about our country 's fiscal realities . Telling them what they already know \u2013 the math of federal spending does n't add up .\nWith $ 5 trillion in debt added over the last four years , we have no other option but to make the hard choices , cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of government .\nThey believe that the American people do n't want to hear the truth about the extent of our fiscal difficulties and need to be coddled by big government .\nThey believe the American people are content to live the lie with them .\nWe believe in telling seniors the truth about our overburdened entitlements .\nWe know seniors not only want these programs to survive , but they just as badly want them secured for their grandchildren .\nThey believe seniors will always put themselves ahead of their grandchildren . So they prey on their vulnerabilities and scare them with misinformation for the cynical purpose of winning the next election .\nTheir plan : whistle a happy tune while driving us off the fiscal cliff , as long as they are behind the wheel of power .\nWe believe that the majority of teachers in America know our system must be reformed to put students first so that America can compete .\nTeachers do n't teach to become rich or famous . They teach because they love children .\nWe believe that we should honor and reward the good ones while doing what 's best for our nation 's future \u2013 demanding accountability , higher standards and the best teacher in every classroom .\nThey believe the educational establishment will always put themselves ahead of children . That self-interest trumps common sense .\nThey believe in pitting unions against teachers , educators against parents , and lobbyists against children .\nWe believe that if we tell the people the truth they will act bigger than the pettiness of Washington , D.C .\nWe believe it 's possible to forge bipartisan compromise and stand up for conservative principles .\nIt 's the power of our ideas , not of our rhetoric , that attracts people to our Party .\nWe win when we make it about what needs to be done ; we lose when we play along with their game of scaring and dividing .\nFor make no mistake , the problems are too big to let the American people lose \u2013 the slowest economic recovery in decades , a spiraling out of control deficit , an education system that 's failing to compete in the world .\nIt does n't matter how we got here . There is enough blame to go around .\nWhen there are people in the room who care more about doing the job they were elected to do than worrying about winning re-election , it 's possible to work together , achieve principled compromise and get results .\nWe need politicians to care more about doing something and less about being something .\nBelieve me , if we can do this in a blue state with a conservative Republican Governor , Washington is out of excuses .\nWe have a nominee who will tell us the truth and who will lead with conviction . And now he has a running mate who will do the same .\nWe have Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan , and we must make them our next president and vice president .\nMitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to put us back on the path to growth and create good paying private sector jobs again in America .\nMitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the torrent of debt that is compromising our future and burying our economy .\nMitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world 's greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor .\nWe ended an era of absentee leadership without purpose or principle in New Jersey .\nIt 's time to end this era of absentee leadership in the Oval Office and send real leaders to the White House .\nAmerica needs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and we need them right now .\nThere is doubt and fear for our future in every corner of our country .\nIt 's a moment like this where some skeptics wonder if American greatness is over .\nHow those who have come before us had the spirit and tenacity to lead America to a new era of greatness in the face of challenge .\nNot to look around and say `` not me , '' but to say , `` Yes , Me . ''\nI have an answer tonight for the skeptics and the naysayers , the dividers and the defenders of the status quo .\nI know we can be the men and women our country calls on us to be .\nThere 's only one thing missing now . Leadership . It takes leadership that you do n't get from reading a poll .\nYou see , Mr. President \u2013 real leaders do n't follow polls . Real leaders change polls .\nTonight , our duty is to tell the American people the truth .\nOur problems are big and the solutions will not be painless . We all must share in the sacrifice . Any leader that tells us differently is simply not telling the truth .\nWe look back and marvel at their courage \u2013 overcoming the Great Depression , fighting Nazi tyranny , standing up for freedom around the world .\nFor make no mistake , every generation will be judged and so will we .\nWhat will our children and grandchildren say of us ? Will they say we buried our heads in the sand , we assuaged ourselves with the creature comforts we 've acquired , that our problems were too big and we were too small , that someone else should make a difference because we ca n't ?\nOr will they say we stood up and made the tough choices needed to preserve our way of life ?\nI do n't know about you , but I do n't want my children and grandchildren to have to read in a history book what it was like to live in an American century .\nI do n't want their only inheritance to be an enormous government that has overtaxed , overspent and over-borrowed a great people into second-class citizenship .\nI want them to live in a second American century .\nA second American century of strong economic growth where those who are willing to work hard will have good paying jobs to support their families and reach their dreams .\nA second American century where real American exceptionalism is not a political punch line , but is evident to everyone in the world just by watching the way our government conducts its business and everyday Americans live their lives .\nA second American century where our military is strong , our values are sure , our work ethic is unmatched and our Constitution remains a model for anyone in the world struggling for liberty .\nLet us choose a path that will be remembered for generations to come . Standing strong for freedom will make the next century as great an American century as the last one .\nI wo n't be part of the generation that fails that test and neither will you .\nIt 's now time to stand up . There 's no time left to waste .\nIf you 're willing to stand up with me for America 's future , I will stand up with you .\nIf you 're willing to fight with me for Mitt Romney , I will fight with you .\nIf you 're willing to hear the truth about the hard road ahead , and the rewards for America that truth will bear , I 'm here to begin with you this new era of truth-telling .\nTonight , we choose the path that has always defined our nation 's history .\nTonight , we finally and firmly answer the call that so many generations have had the courage to answer before us .\nTonight , we stand up for Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States .\nAnd , together , we stand up once again for American greatness .",

Any leader that tells us differently is simply not telling the truth.\n\nI think tonight of the Greatest Generation.\n\nWe look back and marvel at their courage \u2013 overcoming the Great Depression, fighting Nazi tyranny, standing up for freedom around the world.\n\nNow it's our time to answer history's call.\n\nFor make no mistake, every generation will be judged and so will we.\n\nWhat will our children and grandchildren say of us?
