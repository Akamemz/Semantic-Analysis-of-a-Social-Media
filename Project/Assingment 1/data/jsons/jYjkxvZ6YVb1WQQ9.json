    "content": "Kent , Ohio ( CNN ) Hillary Clinton 's campaign is insisting it ca n't be thrown off course in the final week of the presidential race -- because it 's already running on auto-pilot .\nOver the past 18 months , the Democratic nominee has built an impressive campaign infrastructure that has dwarfed her GOP opponent , Donald Trump , on fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts . The sudden revival of Clinton 's private email server as a top campaign issue is emerging as the ultimate test of whether all that work will pay off next week and whether her core message -- that she is the only candidate fit to be president -- will resonate .\nFBI Director James Comey blindsided the Clinton campaign Friday by telling lawmakers newly discovered emails could be pertinent to the probe into the private server . The Clinton campaign and her surrogates are furious that the announcement came so close to the election while Trump and his allies are celebrating the fresh ammunition after spending weeks on defense .\nCampaigning in Kent , Ohio , on Monday , Clinton brushed away the investigation , saying voters have already made up their minds on the email issue .\n`` I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all this , '' Clinton said . `` Now , what people are focused on is choosing the next president and commander and chief of the United States of America . ''\nIf the Trump campaign has run a thoroughly unconventional campaign , with little care for the traditional rules of politics and relatively bare-bones infrastructure , the Clinton operation has devoted much of its time and resources to building out a robust ground game across battleground states .\nIn the final weeks , Clinton has particularly touted her campaign 's Get Out the Vote and early voting campaigns , enlisting help from high-profile celebrities like Jennifer Lopez , Marc Anthony , Katy Perry and Jay-Z . The campaign is hopeful that these efforts will be crucial to driving up turnout on and before Election Day .\nClinton aides cite early voting statistics as proof that while the FBI news has drawn heavy scrutiny in recent days , it has not moved the core of her support\nEarly voting data show that over 3.5 million people have already voted in Florida -- making up nearly one quarter of all registered voters in the state -- with Democrats outpacing 2012 vote-by-mail numbers . Similarly in Nevada , where nearly one-fourth of registered voters have already cast their ballot , Democrats are outpacing Republicans by nearly 30,000 .\nAnd Clinton aides say the core of their base , especially Hispanic voters , have already turned out to vote in high numbers , citing trends in Colorado , Nevada and Florida . Some top advisers believe states with robust early voting and absentee balloting , like Nevada , could essentially be decided before Election Day .\nStill , the campaign is on the lookout for any signs of damage from Comey 's announcement .\nIn some swing states , aides acknowledge that the FBI 's renewed probe appears to have created some volatility with voters .\nThere is anecdotal evidence , for example , of Clinton volunteers fielding questions about the FBI 's investigation while door knocking over the weekend . On the flip side , the campaign has also seen evidence of Democrats who are now more eager to vote for Clinton as a way to rebuke the FBI .\nSince Friday , Clinton and her aides have been adamant : Comey 's action is unprecedented this close to an election , and there is nothing to new to be discovered .\nOn Saturday in Florida , Clinton called his announcement `` pretty strange .
