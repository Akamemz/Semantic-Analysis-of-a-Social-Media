He was a rare politician, one who actually cared about America's coming debt crisis and the unfairness of entitlements. He even talked about F.A. Hayek's \"The Road to Serfdom\"! If only more politicians thought that way.\n\nBut then the housing bubble burst. Ryan voted for TARP. Then he voted for the auto bailout. Who is this guy? I thought he believed in markets!\n\nAt Fox, when I got my own TV show, I asked him about that.\n\n\"I voted for TARP because I believed we were going to fall into a deflationary spiral, the economy was going to collapse. ... The purpose of voting for that auto bill was to prevent the auto companies from getting TARP dollars. ... Now TARP has become this revolving government slush fund. Never was intended ... .\"\n\nBut in your ideal world, should government have bailed out the auto company?\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWhew.\n\nI wish he had voted against those bills, but the political class was in near panic, and Ryan is a politician.\n\nIt's a reason I don't like politicians.\n\nBut at least Ryan speaks against bailouts now.\n\n\"We're reaching a tipping point in this country where a majority of Americans are getting their benefits and livelihoods from the federal government ... .\n\nWhy does this put us on a road to \"serfdom\"?\n\n\"Because we're moving from a society where the goal of government is not to equalize opportunity but to equalize the results of our lives. ... The more we ask government to do for us, the more government can take from us. ... Government is doing so much in our lives that we have less freedom to govern ourselves.\"\n\nI like hearing a politician say that.\n\nI told Ryan that I fear that most Americans don't understand economics and actually prefer a government that \"takes care\" of us.\n\n\"No. I think people believe in the American idea, (that) our rights don't come from government. ... And so we do not want a government where they give us our rights and redistribute, regulate and ration our rights.\"\n\nHope he's right.\n\nIn 2008, Ryan proposed a \"Roadmap for the Future,\" a budget plan that would slow the growth of government. It was timid. It wouldn't eliminate the Education Department or other useless government agencies and wouldn't balance the budget for decades.\n\nYet even Republicans said his plan was too radical. Newt Gingrich called it \"right-wing social engineering.\"\n\nLast year, I invited Ryan back on my show to talk about that. By then, \"the needle had moved.\" Ryan's Roadmap helped change the discussion. Many Republicans woke up. Newt apologized for his comment.
