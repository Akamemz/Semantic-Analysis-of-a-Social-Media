And as a follower of Jesus , I voted for him , despite my misgivings . I \u2019 m also very happy to point out the many good things he has already done as president . But I will not sacrifice my ethics and demean my faith to defend his wrongful words . To do that is to lose all credibility before a watching world .\nPlenty of Christians and non-Christians had a hard time understanding how so many of us evangelicals could vote for a candidate who seemed to be so thoroughly un-evangelical . But when we explained that we were voting against Hillary , that Supreme Court appointees were important to us , and that Trump seemed to care about religious liberties , many of them understood our vote . They see we \u2019 re not whitewashing him or denying his faults . Some dissenters can even respect our choice .\nBut when we find it necessary to defend his every word , we discredit ourselves and tarnish our witness .\nWhat prompted me to pen this article was the recent series of Trump tweets regarding MSNBC \u2019 s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski . The president wrote :\nReally now , for the most powerful elected official on the planet to call liberal newscasters \u201c Psycho Joe \u201d and \u201c low I.Q . Crazy Mika \u201d is indefensible . ( Let \u2019 s not even discuss the \u201c bleeding \u201d reference and where that leads . ) And to defend him \u2013 I mean for us to defend him as Christian conservatives \u2013 is even less defensible .\nWe can be loyal to the president and still be ashamed of such language . We can support him and still say , \u201c Mr . President , you demean yourself with such behavior , and you \u2019 ll never get the respect you desire if you sink so low. \u201d In fact , that \u2019 s what real loyalty and support looks like .\nBut when we find it necessary to stand up for him , as if he \u2019 s the weak little victim being attacked by these terrible giants , we also demean ourselves . And what if it was your son or daughter or spouse or parent that the president was attacking with such language ? How would you feel ? When he does this , he ultimately hurts himself .\nOne man responded to my tweet saying , \u201c This perfect Savior had a very blue collar flavor which we try to scrub away with our sensibilities . Newscasters need accountability too . \u201d\nFirst , no one is denying that newscasters need accountability , and there are a slew of conservative newscasters blasting the liberals day and night ( and vice versa ) .
