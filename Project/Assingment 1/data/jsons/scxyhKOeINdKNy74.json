    "content": "Such are the complexities of the struggle in Iraq , and even liberating Mosul would not end them . How does the American-backed coalition prevent Islamic State fighters from escaping and regrouping , ready to fight another day ? What is to keep the city from again falling prey to extremists if the Shiite-led Iraqi government in Baghdad remains fractured and incapable of building a country in which Sunnis , Shiites and Kurds have equal rights ? Can jobs , housing and basic services be found for Mosul \u2019 s battered people ? Can the next American president prevent the Kurds and their control of key oil and gas fields from becoming a new flash point ?\nSYRIA If anything , Syria \u2019 s battlefield is even more confounding . There are overlapping wars : between President Bashar al-Assad and rebels ; between an American-backed coalition and the Islamic State ; between Turkey and the Kurds . Meanwhile , Russia and Iran are backing Mr. Assad with military power , while the United States and Sunni Arab states , like Saudi Arabia , are helping rebels , some of whom fight either in partnership with or in proximity to the affiliate of Al Qaeda known as the Nusra Front , now called the Levant Conquest Front , making it hard to tell the good guys from the bad .\nThe United States is bombing ISIS targets and deploying special forces as advisers for the moderate rebels , but Mr. Obama has largely resisted military involvement beyond that in what is essentially a sectarian civil war . On Wednesday , The Times reported that he is considering a plan to directly arm Syrian Kurdish fighters . This major shift could help speed up the offensive against the Islamic State while worsening tensions with Turkey . An estimated nearly half a million Syrians have died , mostly due to bombing by Assad forces .\nIn recent weeks , the Obama administration has pursued another cease-fire ( an earlier partial cease-fire collapsed fairly quickly ) that is intended to pave the way for humanitarian aid deliveries as well as broader negotiations on a political transition to end the war , slowly ease Mr. Assad out of power and allow the major combatants to focus their full attention on fighting the Islamic State and the Nusra Front . But success depends as much on Russia as on Mr. Assad . That was made clear on Monday by the bombing of a 31-truck relief convoy that had been promised safe passage under a cease-fire negotiated by Russia and the United States , killing at least a dozen people and destroying tons of humanitarian aid . The Obama administration blamed Moscow while continuing to insist that a cease-fire , however unlikely , could still be made to work . That seemed even less possible on Wednesday after at least four emergency medical workers were reported killed in airstrikes near Aleppo , an area where only Russia and Syria were flying airplanes .\nEven if a durable cease-fire goes into effect and political transition negotiations commence in Syria , the Americans and their allies must still grapple with what to do with the millions of displaced Syrians and the foreign forces \u2014 from Turkey , Iran , Russia and Hezbollah \u2014 that are in the country . Also to be decided is whether to pursue war crimes charges against Mr. Assad , the Islamic State and some rebel groups for the atrocities committed against civilians during the war .\nAT HOME The next president must also confront threats on American soil from extremists who enter this country to commit terrorist acts as well as from people living here who are not formally allied with terrorist groups in the Middle East but draw inspiration from their calls to violence and become radicalized . Authorities said that was the case of Ahmad Khan Rahami , who , before being charged in connection with the weekend bombings in Manhattan and at the Jersey Shore , invoked \u201c brother Osama bin Laden \u201d among other role models .",
