Is it possible we 'd see another one ? A credible third-party campaign by . . . somebody . \u2588\u2588\u2588\nWASHINGTON -- It 's not too late : If Donald Trump loses the Republican presidential nomination , he says he might run for the White House anyway . And if Trump wins the GOP nomination , anti-Trump candidates from the party establishment are considering doing the same .\nWhile it 's an uphill climb and state deadlines loom , there are several ways a third candidate could mount a general-election bid consequential enough to demand attention . `` 'Trump ' is easy to spell , '' notes Democratic strategist Tad Devine , suggesting the billionaire businessman could try a write-in campaign for the nation 's highest office .\nOn the Democratic side , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have promised to support the party 's nominee . But all three remaining Republican rivals have walked back commitments they signed last year to support the party 's nominee . On Fox News Sunday , Trump refused to rule out an independent or third-party candidacy if he fails to win the GOP nomination . `` I 'm going to have to see how I was treated , '' he told Chris Wallace . `` It 's very simple . ''\nIn an election season that already has upended the expected , there are the ingredients that have fueled third-party bids in the past . They include a mercurial potential contender with money \u2014 Donald Trump , meet Ross Perot \u2014 and the sort of ideological divide that prompted moderate congressman John Anderson to run when the GOP shifted right in 1980 to nominate conservative Ronald Reagan . The power of the parties has gotten weaker since then and the rules for getting on state ballots easier .\n`` Minor parties have been working and working and working all these years and it 's slowly paying off , '' says Richard Winger , publisher of Ballot Access News , a newsletter that just might see a surge in readership this year . `` Nobody notices because it 's little incremental changes , but it 's adding up . ''\nIn a little-noticed ruling last month , for instance , a U.S. District Court struck down the provision in Georgia that required independent presidential candidates to submit petitions with signatures equal to 1 % of eligible registered voters . In Green Party of Georgia v. Kemp , Judge Richard Story ruled that the state 's ballot requirement , one of the toughest in the country , was too onerous . He set an interim standard of 7,500 signatures until the state legislature acts .\n`` There are two candidates in this race who could be a third-party candidate , and that 's Trump and Bernie Sanders , '' says Republican strategist Ed Rollins , who for a time ran Perot 's 1992 independent bid . `` If Trump chose to go outside and spend his own money , he 'd create chaos , '' albeit with a better chance of helping to elect Clinton than himself , Rollins says .\nNeither Perot nor Anderson won the White House , of course , but they participated in debates and affected the cross-currents of the campaign . Some analysts say Ralph Nader 's campaign in 2000 as the Green Party nominee may have pulled enough votes from Democrat Al Gore in Florida to tip the closely divided state -- and with it the presidency -- to Republican George W. Bush , although Nader disputes that .\n`` If Donald Trump gets nominated and continues to drive his negatives through the roof , conceivably a third-party candidate could become the de facto Republican nominee , '' says GOP pollster Whit Ayres . Speculation has centered on establishment leaders who have been outspoken in criticizing Trump , including 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and former 2016 contender Jeb Bush .\nLast week , The Texas Tribune reported there was no record of former governor Rick Perry voting in the state 's primary , although he had endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz . That drew notice because it would preserve Perry 's eligibility to run as an independent in the fall . While Perry last year described Trump 's candidacy as `` a cancer on conservatism , '' a spokesman said the former presidential hopeful was n't interested in making an independent bid .\nVoters increasingly are open to voting for someone other than the Democrat or the Republican . In the most recent \u2588\u2588\u2588/Suffolk University poll , taken in February , only a third of those surveyed said the two major parties did a good job of representing Americans ' political views . A 54 % majority said three or more parties were necessary .\nRunning for president this year as a third candidate is n't easy . That does n't mean it 's impossible . Let 's count the ways .\nThat 's what Perot did in 1992 . The Texas billionaire said he was open to a draft movement in February , opened a phone bank in March and after an in-and-out campaign was on all 50 state ballots in November . There were times during the campaign when he led Republican George H.W . Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton in national polls , and he participated in the fall debates .\nIn the end , Perot carried 19 % of the popular vote , the most for any third candidate since Teddy Roosevelt 's bid in 1912 as the Progressive `` Bull Moose '' party 's nominee .\nTexas has the earliest deadline and some of the stiffest requirements for an independent presidential candidate to get on the ballot . By May 9 -- just five weeks away -- a candidate must submit petitions with 70,939 signatures . Realistically , the number has to be much higher as a cushion for signatures that might be thrown out as ineligible . North Carolina 's deadline is next , on June 9 . Three other states ( Illinois , Indiana and New Mexico ) have deadlines in late June .\nBut thirty-one states and the District of Columbia do n't have deadlines until August , and many require only a nominal number of signatures , such as 275 in Tennessee and 800 in New Jersey . In Colorado , a check for $ 1,000 gets a candidate on the ballot . The final deadlines ( in Arizona , Kentucky , Mississippi and Rhode Island ) are on Sept. 9 .\nThat said , 11 states have deadlines before the Republican convention opens in Cleveland on July 18 , and other deadlines begin to follow in a crush .\nThe Libertarian Party already is on track to be on every state ballot this fall . Party chairman Nicholas Sarwark , 36 , whose family owns an independent car dealership in Phoenix , says more than one of this year 's presidential contenders have been in touch to express interest in the Libertarian nomination . He wo n't name names or even specify if the calls came on behalf of Republicans or Democrats , or both .\n`` There 's a lot of frustration that candidates feel like they were n't able to get a hearing from the Republican or Democratic races , that there was n't enough oxygen in the room , '' he says . He says his party could be open to nominating a newcomer . `` It would be up to that candidate to make the case that they were Libertarian or Libertarian enough .
