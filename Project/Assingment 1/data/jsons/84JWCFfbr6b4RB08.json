The president \u2019 s use of a private , non-secure channel to discuss sensitive matters with high level officials may not have been systematic , as Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s was . ( Obama \u2019 s disturbing use of an alias , however , suggests that Clinton was not the only one he was privately e-mailing . ) Nevertheless , the fact that the president was e-mailing Clinton means he not only participated in her misconduct but also that the Obama-Clinton e-mails would have been admissible evidence in any criminal trial of Clinton .\nFor the parties to prove such culpable conduct on the president \u2019 s part in a high-profile criminal trial would have been profoundly embarrassing to him , to say the least . Therefore , it was never going to happen . As I \u2019 ve noted before , after exclaiming , \u201c How is that not classified ? \u201d upon being shown an Obama-Clinton e-mail by the FBI , Hillary \u2019 s confidant Huma Abedin asked agents if she could have a copy of the exchange . She obviously realized that if Obama had been communicating on Clinton \u2019 s non-secure server system , no one else who had done so was going to be prosecuted for it .\nWe now know that Podesta was very concerned about the Obama-Clinton e-mails and turned to Mills for advice . His succinct e-mail to Mills is dated March 4 , 2015 ( at 8:41 p.m. ) , and he entitled it \u201c Special Category. \u201d He stated :\nThink we should hold emails to and from potus ? That \u2019 s the heart of his exec privilege . We could get them to ask for that . They may not care , but I [ sic ] seems like they will .\nPlainly , Podesta was suggesting to Mills that the Obama-Clinton e-mails were in a \u201c special category \u201d \u2014 i.e. , distinct from the tens of thousands of other Clinton e-mails \u2014 because they involved the president . Only the president has power to invoke executive privilege , and Podesta believed such invocation would legitimately cover a communication between Obama and his secretary of state , since such consultations are \u201c the heart of \u201d the privilege recognized by the Supreme Court in United States v. Nixon . ( I think he was wrong about that , but that \u2019 s a matter for another day . )\nThe timing of the March 4 Podesta-Mills e-mail is highly significant .\nIf Mills ever responded to Podesta \u2019 s question , we do not have an e-mail to that effect . It is unlikely Mills would have ignored Podesta , particularly on a matter of such significance . Thus , I suspect further discussion was had face-to-face , by phone , or through intermediaries .\nThe timing of the March 4 Podesta-Mills e-mail is highly significant . The date places it about three weeks after Podesta left his White House job as the president \u2019 s top advisor in order to head up the Clinton presidential campaign ; the transitioning Podesta was still involved in Oval Office doings , and the Clinton campaign was up and running though not yet publicly launched . More significantly , the e-mail occurred when both the administration and the campaign were in crisis mode : It was immediately after the New York Times publicly exposed Clinton \u2019 s private e-mail system , and the House Benghazi committee had just issued a subpoena , demanding that Clinton preserve and provide any private e-mails within the scope of the committee \u2019 s investigation .\nWith that as background , we should consider three salient matters .\nIn the days immediately after the Times \u2019 revelation of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s systematic use of private e-mail to conduct government business , President Obama sat for interviews in which he claimed that he \u2019 d learned of Clinton \u2019 s personal e-mail use through \u201c news reports \u201d like everyone else . He flatly denied that he had any personal knowledge about the matter . Clearly , the president was lying to the American people : He knew he personally had engaged in several e-mails with Clinton . By extension , Obama was also lying to the Congress . As he well knew , congressional committees had been investigating matters ( most prominently , Benghazi ) in which communications between Obama and Clinton were of immense importance . Now , we know Obama not only had intimate personal awareness of what Clinton was doing ; his top White House advisor , Podesta , was both aware of and concerned about the Obama-Clinton e-mails .\nDid Obama figure that because he had used an alias , the public and the Congress would never find out about his e-mails with Clinton ( and with whomever else he has been exchanging e-mails while using the alias ) ?\nDid the president figure he could quietly invoke executive privilege such that no one would ever find out about his e-mails with Clinton ?\nGiven that Obama was manifestly determined to conceal his e-mails with Clinton , what is the chance that he would ever have permitted a prosecution of Clinton , which would necessarily have exposed those e-mails ? To repeat what I \u2019 ve been arguing , I \u2019 d rate it as something less than non-existent .\nWe know that on the evening of March 4 , when Podesta e-mailed Mills , the matter of greatest concern to the fledgling Clinton campaign was the House Benghazi committee \u2019 s subpoena for former Secretary Clinton \u2019 s private e-mails . Before Podesta contacted her , Mills received an e-mail from Robby Mook , the Clinton campaign manager . There had been discussion among Clinton operatives about whether the State Department would release all of the e-mails Clinton had turned over ( i.e. , the 30,000 she had surrendered , not the 33,000 she had withheld and would soon undertake to destroy ) . Mook thus wanted \u201c clarity \u201d on whether \u201c this House subpoena is just for Libya , right ? \u201d Mills replied that this was \u201c right . \u201d\nDid the president figure that because he had used an alias , the public and the Congress would never find out about his e-mails ?\nIn the midst of this discussion about the subpoena , Mills received Podesta \u2019 s message about the Obama-Clinton e-mails \u2014 just a half-hour before she responded to Mook . Given that the House subpoena was front-and-center at the time , one must ask whether Podesta was concerned about possible connections between the Obama-Clinton e-mails and Benghazi . To be sure , this is not necessarily the case . The Clinton camp and the Obama White House were also dealing with the overarching problem of how to handle the e-mail mess in general . Any Obama-Clinton e-mails were going to be a problem for both the White House and the Clinton campaign , not just any Benghazi-related e-mails .\nStill , the Benghazi question must be asked . Among the most central Benghazi issues were whether Obama-Clinton communications had occurred and , if so , what they were about . For example , why did the White House first deny that Obama had been in contact with Clinton on the night of the terrorist attack when , in fact , the two had spoken on the phone around 10 p.m. ? Was there a connection between this call and the statement by Secretary Clinton , issued almost simultaneously , which blamed the anti-Muslim video ( rather than al-Qaeda affiliated jihadists ) for the attack ?\nTo this day , the Obama-Clinton e-mails have not been made public . Quite apart from the question of why the president and secretary of state were communicating on high-level policy matters over a private , non-secure channel , there remains the question whether any of their e-mail communications were related to Benghazi \u2014 the appalling lack of security before the attack , the disgraceful lack of a military response during the attack , or the cynical \u201c blame the video \u201d cover-up after the attack .\n3 . The Obama Justice Department and FBI Ignore and Destroy Cheryl Mills \u2019 s E-mails\nLet \u2019 s place the Podesta e-mails ( with Mills and other Clinton campaign operatives ) in broader context . Not only did they occur right after the public revelation of the Clinton homebrew server and the House subpoena . They occurred in the midst of what we know are communications between Mills and Platte River Networks , the contractor servicing the Clinton server . In late March , Paul Combetta , the PRN technician with whom Mills was in touch , deleted and undertook to destroy all the e-mails on Clinton \u2019 s server \u2014 including the 33,000 that Clinton had never provided to the State Department , and that she falsely claimed involved only personal matters and contained no classified information .\nAt a minimum , the Podesta e-mails demonstrate that , when Clinton \u2019 s homebrew system was revealed , the reaction among Obama-Clinton operatives was not stunned disbelief . Their conduct was , instead , what one would expect from people who were well aware of Clinton \u2019 s e-mail situation , and who now understood their mission was to control damage and minimize disclosure . This state-of-mind evidence would have been crucial to any prosecution against Clinton and her confederates for mishandling classified information , destroying government files , or obstruction of justice .\nWhen Clinton \u2019 s homebrew system was revealed , the reaction among Obama-Clinton operatives was not stunned disbelief .\nSince that is so obviously the case , and would have been even more obviously the case to FBI agents and prosecutors working on the Clinton e-mails investigation , why on earth would the Justice Department make a deal with Cheryl Mills that prevented the FBI from examining her e-mails during this critical March 2015 time frame ?\nConsider just one small example : As noted above , it does not appear that Mills replied in writing to Podesta \u2019 s March 4 e-mail about concealing the Obama-Clinton e-mails .

The Justice Department agreed that the FBI would not examine anything on Mills \u2019 s laptop computer post-dating January 31 , 2015 and , unbelievably , that the FBI would destroy the laptop after its limited examination .\nWhy would the Justice Department grant Mills immunity from prosecution and negotiate such severe restrictions on the FBI \u2019 s ability to review and preserve her e-mails in exchange for access to Mills \u2019 s laptop computer ? After all , they could have forced Mills to produce the laptop , without making accommodations , by simply issuing a grand-jury subpoena .\nAnd why , after Mills asked for and received immunity from prosecution for her conduct , would the Justice Department and the FBI permit her to sit in \u2014 as a lawyer \u2014 on Clinton \u2019 s FBI interview , a decision that not only flouted ethical rules and federal law but would also have damaged the case against Clinton had there been an indictment ?\n# related # Try this for a theory : Since President Obama had used an alias to discuss sensitive matters on Clinton \u2019 s private , non-secure e-mail system , had then falsely denied knowledge of that system , and had decided to conceal his e-mails with Clinton from the public , the Justice Department knew that no one was ever going to be prosecuted anyway .
