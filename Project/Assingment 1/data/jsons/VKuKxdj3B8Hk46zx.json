    "content": "With Brett Kavanaugh poised to be confirmed Saturday after the most partisan Supreme Court nomination process in memory , there are widespread concerns that the attacks Judge Kavanaugh both received and delivered over the past month could resonate long into the future . For his sympathizers , his fiery statements accusing liberals of a conspiracy to bring him down were an isolated defense against career-threatening allegations . Supporters argue that they have little bearing on how he would perform as a justice compared with his record and reputation from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . \u201c He \u2019 s always been fair and even-handed , and I would expect him to continue to do that if he were appointed to the Supreme Court , \u201d says Jennifer Mascott , a law professor who clerked for Kavanaugh and has known him throughout his 12 years on the D.C . Circuit . Still , in the eyes of many others \u2013 from friends and former colleagues to a former Supreme Court justice \u2013 his defense against the allegations crossed a line that no nominee for the high court should cross . His testimony \u201c was a sad day for our country , \u201d says Kermit Roosevelt , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law . \u201c Kavanaugh \u2019 s sense of partisan bitterness was disturbing in that it suggests partisan concerns will affect his judicial behavior . \u201d\nBrett Kavanaugh looks poised to become the newest justice on the United States Supreme Court on Saturday .\nSenators spent the past two days taking turns in a room in a sub-basement on Capitol Hill to review the findings of an FBI investigation into multiple sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh . With Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine throwing her support behind Kavanaugh Friday afternoon , the most bitter and partisan confirmation fight of modern times looks like it will reach its conclusion with Saturday afternoon 's vote .\nIf confirmed , there are widespread concerns that the attacks Kavanaugh both received and delivered over the past month could resonate long into the future .\nFor his sympathizers , his fiery statements last week were an isolated and commensurate defense against career-threatening allegations .\nAccusing Democratic senators on the committee of \u201c grotesque and coordinated character assassination , \u201d Kavanaugh described the allegations as \u201c a calculated and orchestrated political hit \u201d fueled by anger over President Trump \u2019 s election victory , \u201c revenge on behalf of the Clintons , and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups . \u201d\nSupporters argue that these have little bearing on how he would perform as a justice compared with his record and reputation from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . Kavanaugh himself seemed to address concerns about his temperament and impartiality in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal Thursday evening , explaining that he was \u201c very emotional \u201d during the hearing and \u201c said a few things I should not have said . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s always been fair and even-handed , and I would expect him to continue to do that if he were appointed to the Supreme Court , \u201d says Jennifer Mascott , a former clerk for Kavanaugh who has known him throughout his 12 years on the D.C . Circuit and who teaches at George Mason University \u2019 s Antonin Scalia Law School . \u201c What was happening at the hearing was a very specific set of circumstances , allegations brought against him that necessitated a personal response and direct response . \u201d\nSenator Collins did n't reference Kavanaugh 's partisan comments in her speech today . Still , in the eyes of many others \u2013 from friends and former colleagues to a former Supreme Court justice \u2013 his defense against the allegations crossed a line that no nominee for the high court should cross .\nHis testimony \u201c was a sad day for our country , \u201d says Kermit Roosevelt , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in Philadelphia . \u201c Kavanaugh \u2019 s sense of partisan bitterness was disturbing in that it suggests partisan concerns will affect his judicial behavior . \u201d\nSupreme Court confirmations have become political war zones in recent years , but this particular confirmation was always likely to have even more partisan energy . Mr. Trump has committed to only nominating jurists with strong conservative credentials , and this nominee would replace Justice Anthony Kennedy , the court \u2019 s longtime swing justice who ruled in favor of liberals on issues like same-sex marriage , abortion rights , and affirmative action .\n\u201c We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy , \u201d Collins said in her speech on the Senate floor . \u201c Despite the turbulent bitter fights surrounding his nomination , my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions , and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored . \u201d\nGiven the context , it is perhaps unsurprising this confirmation played out as a more extreme version of another bitter confirmation battle .\nJustice Clarence Thomas also fiercely defended himself against sordid allegations , in his case from Anita Hill , a former assistant at the Department of Education , during his 1991 confirmation . But while Justice Thomas , an African-American , famously called the eleventh-hour sexual harassment accusations a \u201c high-tech lynching for uppity blacks , \u201d he displayed a calm temperament in his response , never directly blaming Senate Democrats . The Democrat-controlled chamber ultimately confirmed him 52-to-48 .\nLast week , Kavanaugh was combative and hostile toward Democrats . He interrupted Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D ) of California , the committee \u2019 s ranking member , and asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D ) of Minnesota whether she had ever blacked out from drinking ( he later apologized ) . The tone took aback even those who supported his confirmation .\n\u201c I was very troubled by the tone of [ his ] remarks , \u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake ( R ) of Arizona , a moderate who last Friday pushed for the additional FBI investigation .\n\u201c I tell myself , \u2018 You give a little leeway because of what he \u2019 s been through , \u2019 \u201d he added . \u201c But on the other hand , we can \u2019 t have this on the court . We simply can \u2019 t . \u201d\nBenjamin Wittes , editor in chief of the Lawfare blog who says he \u2019 s known Kavanaugh for 20 years , wrote in the Atlantic , \u201c the Brett Kavanaugh who showed up to [ last week \u2019 s ] hearing is a man I have never met . \u201d\n\u201c Faced with credible allegations of misconduct against him , Kavanaugh behaved in a fashion unacceptable of a justice , \u201d he added . \u201c Can anyone seriously entertain the notion that a reasonable pro-choice woman would feel like her position could get a fair shake before a Justice Kavanaugh ? Can anyone seriously entertain the notion that a reasonable Democrat , or a reasonable liberal of any kind , would , after that performance , consider him a fair arbiter in , say , a case about partisan gerrymandering , voter identification , or anything else with a strong partisan valence ? \u201d\nMore than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying his testimony displayed a lack of judicial restraint that should be disqualifying . On Thursday , retired Justice John Paul Stevens , a Gerald Ford appointee who served on the court for 35 years , agreed .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve changed my views for reasons that have no really relationship to his intellectual ability or his record as a federal judge . He 's a fine federal judge , \u201d he said . \u201c I think that his performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind . \u201d\nIf confirmed , Kavanaugh would join a court with eroding public confidence . About half of Americans had a great deal of confidence in the Supreme Court prior to its Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 , according to Gallup polling . In June , the most recent Gallup measurement , 37 percent of Americans had faith in the institution .\nIf Kavanaugh becomes part of a conservative majority in a controversial 5-to-4 decision , that could further damage the court \u2019 s reputation , says Jon Michaels , a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , School of Law .\n\u201c Every time [ a 5-to-4 decision ] comes up we \u2019 re going to revisit those moments \u201d from the hearing , he adds . \u201c That \u2019 s going to reinforce concerns that the court is entirely political , and for some it will say this is a further reason why it \u2019 s not a legitimate body . \u201d\nIn his Wall Street Journal op-ed , Kavanaugh wrote that his testimony last week \u201c reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused ... [ and ] my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled . \u201d\n\u201c Going forward , you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career : hardworking , even-keeled , open-minded , independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good , \u201d he added . \u201c I have not changed . \u201d\n\u201c The best example of his judicial temperament is the temperament he brought to the bench for 12 years on the D.C. Circuit , \u201d says Adam White , an assistant professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School . \u201c He was an impartial and well-regarded judge throughout his time on the D.C . Circuit even after having worked in the Bush administration and for Ken Starr , \u201d the independent counsel whose investigation of former-President Bill Clinton led to an impeachment vote .\nAnd while Supreme Court confirmations are always political , what institutional damage they cause is typically confined to the Senate .\n\u201c What detracts from the court \u2019 s legitimacy is the conduct of the court in deciding cases , \u201d he adds . \u201c All judges are expected to take their personal attachments and personal instincts and personal feelings and set them aside as best as anyone can .... I would presume he like all judges will do the best he can , and he will succeed in that . \u201d\nThe vote Friday morning suggests the investigation may have been enough to assuage the concerns the likes of Senator Flake harbored about Kavanaugh \u2019 s temperament . But for others , there are still lingering doubts .\nFor Professor Roosevelt \u201c the main concern was less the emotion than the partisanship \u201d Kavanaugh displayed last week .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very standard for judges to proclaim themselves nonpartisan , even when they then go on and act in partisan ways , \u201d he adds in an email . \u201c I take the more or less open admission of a partisan understanding of the world to be more informative than the standard denial . \u201d\nUltimately , time would be the test of whether the Kavanaugh from the first hearing or the Kavanaugh from the second hearing would best reflect a Justice Kavanaugh .\nJustice Thomas \u2019 s post-confirmation behavior is the closest , albeit still an imperfect , parallel . Already deeply conservative before he joined the high court , legal scholars don \u2019 t think the confirmation process changed his jurisprudence . It may have changed his behavior off the bench , however .\nUnlike other conservative justices , such as Antonin Scalia , for many years Thomas kept a more selective public speaking schedule . For years he refused to speak at Ivy League law schools ( including Yale , his alma mater ) , and fraternized mostly with other conservatives , according to Charles Fried , a conservative Harvard law professor and colleague of Thomas \u2019 s in the Reagan administration .\n\u201c The effect of that has been to harden his point of view and to make him more extreme and isolated in his ideas , \u201d Professor Fried told NPR in 2011 .\nIf he is confirmed , Kavanaugh will face a similar choice about whether to similarly cloister himself by socializing only with like-minded people .\nEarlier this week he withdrew from a Harvard Law School class he had been scheduled to teach in January . Hundreds of alumni have called for his lectureship at the school to be rescinded , and current students have called for a school-led investigation into sexual assault allegations against him .\n\u201c He \u2019 s going to have to pick his battles if he is looking to win people over rather than just hunker down in his own camp , \u201d says Professor Michaels . \u201c Which way he goes will also be quite revealing . \u201d\nNo matter how Kavanaugh conducts himself after he is confirmed , significant partisan opposition would remain . Senate Democrats have questioned the depth of this week \u2019 s FBI investigation \u2013 the White House barred agents from interviewing either Kavanaugh or his first accuser , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford . Other Democrats have discussed investigating whether he should be impeached . Gallup polling last week shows that Americans are closely and ideologically divided on his confirmation .\nThe court has responded to a fraught partisan moment in the recent past . Two years ago , as Senate Republicans blocked Judge Merrick Garland \u2019 s nomination , the short-handed and ideologically-split court avoided major cases and resolved many others on narrow legal grounds .\nStill , every justice is a human being who is \u201c the sum of the parts of a personal past , \u201d wrote Lyle Denniston , a journalist who has covered the Supreme Court for 60 years , for the National Constitution Center . If Kavanaugh takes the anger and hurt feelings he says he \u2019 s felt in the past few weeks , his colleagues on the high court would be in a position to ensure that doesn \u2019 t damage the institution \u2019 s credibility .\n\u201c In the disciplines of the Court \u2019 s methods and habits , in the almost constant need to persuade others who bring their own visions and are just as smart as he is , in the reality that what he personally writes and makes public ought to read like law rather than spite , and that his ultimate standing in history will depend at least in part upon whether he has overcome the emotion of his experience as a nominee , \u201d he wrote . \u201c His colleagues would help him with that . \u201d",
