    "content": "Many of the techniques Trump uses in his speeches are timeworn propaganda maneuvers , used by demagogues across the centuries : appealing to voters \u2019 emotions , rather than their intellects ; constantly repeating a handful of simplistic ideas in easy-to-remember phrases ( \u201c Make America Great Again , \u201d \u201c America First \u201d ) ; using us-versus-them formulations and coded ( or not-so-coded ) language about minorities and immigrants that play to audiences \u2019 resentments and fears ; relentlessly assailing \u201c enemies \u201d with memorable epithets ( \u201c Crooked Hillary , \u201d \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d ) .\nPrecise words , like facts , appear not to mean that much to Trump .\nIf Trump \u2019 s favorite form of communication , Twitter , is emblematic of his own short attention span and appetite for the verbal punch-and-jab , it \u2019 s also a reminder of how uncannily adapted his use of language has been to our A.D.D. , information-overloaded era in which the loudest , shrillest and most sensationalistic voices tend to be the ones heard above the din of data , and get the most clicks online , the most eyeballs on TV . His sowing of discord ( for instance , against women , against Muslims , against Mexicans ) reflects an increasingly polarized landscape in which technology has allowed people to retreat to narrow silos , talking only to like-minded folks ; just as his willful contempt for facts ( from questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States to his claim that he watched \u201c thousands and thousands of people \u201d cheering in New Jersey , \u201c when the World Trade Center came tumbling down \u201d on 9/11 ) mirrors a cultural landscape in which subjectivity and fake news are ascendant .
