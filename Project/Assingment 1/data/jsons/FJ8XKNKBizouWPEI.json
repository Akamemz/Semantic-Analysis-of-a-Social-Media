    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump 's former national security adviser , Michael Flynn , did not include receiving thousands of dollars in speaking fees from three Russian companies in initial financial disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics covering the last two years , copies of the reports show .\nFlynn submitted the initial disclosures in mid-February , just days before he resigned from his post after it became public that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia 's ambassador to the United States , Sergey Kislyak . His resignation came amid federal probes into allegations that Trump associates colluded with Russian operatives to interfere in the US election .\nThe initial disclosures left out that Flynn received money from Russia 's state-funded television network , RT , for a speech in Moscow in December 2015 and from air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the United States . The initial document also left off nearly two dozen other speeches from a diverse array of organizations , including business groups and financial services companies , which Flynn was required to itemize .\nFlynn included the speaking fees in disclosure forms he filed Friday , according to the documents . Both sets of filings were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials .\nFlynn attorney Robert Kelner said Flynn `` had only just begun the financial disclosure filing process at the time he left the White House .\n`` He filed a draft form explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract , and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counsel 's Office and OGE regarding what he was expected to disclose , '' Kelner said . `` That process was suspended , however , after he resigned . When the White House asked him this week to complete the process and to itemize the specific speaking events , he did so . ''\nWhen asked to list sources exceeding $ 5,000 year , in his initial paperwork , Flynn disclosed only five organizations from which he received speaking fees in the past two years , including a speakers bureau that set up many of the speaking engagements that he detailed in his second filing .

The agency set him up with the three speeches to Russian groups , as well as talks to a slew of other companies and organizations , such as Wells Fargo and the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce .\nFlynn also left some speeches off his initial forms that do n't appear to be linked to Leading Authorities or another speakers bureau . Those include talks to Halifax Investment Management and Black Duck Software , which he identified only as consulting jobs in his initial filing .\nThe initial and recent disclosures also show discrepancy in how he listed a speaking engagement paid for by Ibrahim Kurtulus , a former official with the nonprofit Assembly of Turkish American Associations , a Turkish-American advocacy group based in D.C .\nIn his initial forms , Flynn lists Kurtulus in a section detailing sources of income exceeding $ 5,000 in the past two years .
