    "content": "For months , and even before she declared her presidential candidacy , many have questioned whether former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina is actually serious about running for president and not just locking down a vice presidential nomination . This speculation has been driving me nuts , especially since it 's continued after she announced a run for the White House earlier this month .\nBut over the weekend anchor Katie Couric , infamous for her interview with Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential cycle , brought up the notion again and asked Fiorina directly if she was really just running to be picked as vice president .\n`` Really many people believe that you do n't have a great chance of securing the GOP nomination . You 're polling around one percent so are you hoping that in fact you may be tapped as a vice presidential candidate ? '' Couric asked during an interview with Fiorina last week .\n`` Oh Katie , would you ask a male candidate that question ? '' Fiorina responded .\nNo word on when Couric will be asking Hillary Clinton the same types of questions about her presidential campaign .\nWould Fiorina be a great VP pick ? Absolutely . If she does n't win the GOP nomination could she be selected by another candidate for VP ? Yes , but this is beside the point . Fiorina is running for president , not vice president . She did n't launch a presidential campaign to land in the number two position . She 's competing for the most powerful position in the world and she 's proven to be serious about it . She 's answered 200 questions from the media since Monday about her presidential candidacy and has been traveling around the country meeting with voters to make her case for months . Meanwhile , Hillary Clinton has answered 8 questions since announcing her run more than a month ago .\nFurther , although Fiorina does n't have huge name recognition , she 's making gains in presidential polling .\nFiorina is running for president . The press should proceed accordingly .",
