Early results are alarming .\nConsider the findings of a study in this month 's issue of Social Psychology , examining how the `` mere presence '' of a cell phone -- even when it is not being used -- influences people 's performance on complex mental tasks . Within the study , participants were asked to quickly scan a row of digits and cross out consecutive numbers that add to a pre-specified total ( for example , any two numbers that total 3 ) . Before they started , half of participants were asked to put away their phones . The other half were asked to place it on their desk , ostensibly so they could answer a few survey questions about its features .\nNot a single cell phone went off during the experiment .
