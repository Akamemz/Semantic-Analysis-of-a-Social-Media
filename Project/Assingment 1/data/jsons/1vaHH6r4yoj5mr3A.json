( AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 A majority of Americans disapprove of protests against restrictions aimed at preventing the spread the coronavirus , according to a new poll that also finds the still-expansive support for such limits \u2014 including restaurant closures and stay-at-home orders \u2014 has dipped in recent weeks .\nThe new survey from the University of Chicago Divinity School and The \u2588\u2588\u2588-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 55 % of Americans disapprove of the protests that have popped up in some states as some Americans begin chafing at public health measures that have decimated the global economy . Thirty-one percent approve of the demonstrations .\nTexas hair salon owner Shelley Luther was sentenced to seven days in jail last week after refusing to apologize to a judge for opening her salon in defiance of Republican Gov . Greg Abbott \u2019 s emergency orders . She was released less than 48 hours later after Abbott removed jail as a punishment for defying virus safeguards .\nIn Michigan , thousands of people rallied outside the state capitol last month to protest Democratic Gov . Gretchen Whitmer \u2019 s restrictions . Hundreds returned two weeks later , some of them armed , to demonstrate inside the statehouse .\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans to disapprove of such protests , 67 % to 51 % . Thirty-two percent of Republicans and 25 % of Democrats say they approve . Only 8 % said public protests , marches and rallies should be unrestricted during the outbreak , while 41 % think they should be allowed only with restrictions and 50 % think they should not be allowed at all .\nDee Miner , 71 , of Fremont , California , said she disapproves of the protests , but also feels people have the right to express themselves .\n\u201c We have to have the right to protest , but I have to tell you , seeing those people with those weapons at the statehouse in Michigan was pretty disturbing , \u201d said Miner , a Democrat and retired dental office manager . \u201c I felt sorry for the legislators having to work with that angry mob in the lobby . It seemed like it was just pure intimidation . \u201d\nAdam Blann , 37 , of Carson City , Nevada , said he does not personally favor the protests , but does not believe they should be restricted .\n\u201c Its a tough situation , \u201d said Blann , a Republican-leaning voter who works in the natural gas industry . \u201c But I also think that one of the reasons we live in a great country is that we have freedom of expression , freedom of speech , freedom to protest . \u201d\nAs some states have begun to slowly ease restrictions on businesses and individuals , the poll finds that 71 % of Americans favor requiring people to stay in their homes except for essential errands . Support for such measures is down slightly from 80 % two weeks earlier .\nSimilarly , 67 % of Americans now say they favor requiring bars and restaurants to close , down from 76 % in the earlier poll . The poll also suggested dipping support for requiring Americans to limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer ( from 82 % to 75 % ) and requiring postponement of nonessential medical care ( from 68 % to 57 % ) .\nMark Roberts , a retired transportation worker in Abingdon , Virginia , said he \u2019 s going about his business despite Democratic Gov . Ralph Northam \u2019 s stay-at-home order .

The share supporting other measures also dropped , from 75 % to 63 % for limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people and from 70 % to 53 % for closing bars and restaurants .\nAmong Democrats , 84 % favor stay-at-home orders , down slightly from 91 % in the earlier poll . Eighty-seven percent of Democrats favor barring gatherings of more than 10 people , and 79 % support bar and restaurant closures , about the same as in the previous poll .\nBlann , the Nevada resident , said he didn \u2019 t mind officials imposing certain restrictions for a short period of time , but fears the potential of authorities being unwilling to roll back some of their newly declared powers .\n\u201c I do think the government should respond to allowing people to make more of their own personal choices without legal repercussions , \u201d said Blann , who said he doesn \u2019 t expect to find himself in a crowded bar anytime soon , but is looking forward to being able to go back to church .\nThe poll found most Americans in favor of some kind of restriction on in-person worship , with 42 % saying that should be allowed with restriction and 48 % that it should not be allowed at all .\nMarilou Grainger , a retired nurse anesthetist and registered Republican in Washington , Missouri , said she \u2019 s torn between the need to take precautions against the virus while also allowing people to make their own decisions .\n\u201c I think we should still be under a bit of quarantine , especially people who are 60 or older , \u201d said Grainger , 67 , who believes the jury is still out on whether lockdowns and stay-at-home orders have been effective in stemming the spread of the virus .\n\u201c Did we make a mistake ?
