    "content_original": "Michael Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The federal government is moving closer to its third government shutdown since President Donald Trump took office.\n\nTrump said he's willing to let it happen.\n\nLast week, in the wake of former President George H.W. Bush's funeral, Congress and Trump agreed to keep the government open through Dec. 21. If lawmakers fail to act before that day, some government agencies will no longer have the necessary funding to keep operating and will be forced to close their doors when that day comes.\n\nHere's a closer look:\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nCongress approved five bills providing funding for defense, energy and water, labor, Health and Human Services, the legislative branch and Veterans Affairs. Trump signed those into law.\n\nSeven other spending bills await congressional action. The bills that need approval would fund the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, as well as several smaller agencies.\n\nThose are departments and agencies that would be affected by a government shutdown.\n\nWhy is the deadline next week?\n\nThe federal fiscal year began Oct. 1, but since Congress had not funded every department and agency, lawmakers passed a short-term funding bill in late September to give them time to finish their work.\n\nThat short-term bill went through midnight Dec. 7, but after former President Bush died \u2013 which led to a national day of mourning and a state funeral \u2013 Trump and lawmakers agreed to extend the deadline through Dec. 21.\n\nThis leaves Congress with few options: Pass all seven of the remaining spending bills by next week, which is a tall order. Pass another short-term spending bill to buy more time. Pass six of the remaining seven budget bills and a one-year extension of the funding for Homeland Security, an idea that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer of New York are pushing, so negotiations on border security funding could continue into 2019. Or allow the short-term funding to lapse, which would trigger a partial government shutdown.\n\nWhat\u2019s the likelihood of a shutdown?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say.\n\nCongressional Republicans and Democrats insist they don\u2019t want to shutter the government, yet they have been unable to reach an agreement on issues that would allow them to pass the outstanding spending bills.\n\nShutdown talk was ratcheted up this week after a public clash between Trump and congressional Democratic leaders. Trump insisted he would be \"proud\" to shut down the federal government if he didn\u2019t get the $5 billion he demands for a border wall with Mexico.\n\nExplore:We looked at every mile of the U.S.-Mexican border. You can, too \u2013 right here.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get what we want ... we will shut down the government,\" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Schumer and Pelosi.\n\nThe Democrats pushed back, insisting Trump didn't have the votes.\n\nThe president said he didn't mind the idea of \"owning\" a possible shutdown.\n\n\u201cIf we have to close down the country (over) border security, I actually like that in terms of an issue,\u201d he said.\n\nAre there other sticking points?\n\nOf course.\n\nSchumer indicated that Democrats might block passage of the spending bill unless Congress approves legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation from White House interference.\n\nMueller is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and has come under withering attack from Trump, who labeled the investigation \u201cThe Mueller Witch Hunt\u201d and \u201ca total disgrace.\u201d Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday and accused the special counsel\u2019s office of trying to coerce witnesses to testify against him.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump has no plans to get rid of Mueller. Some members of Congress, including retiring Sen.

The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in February on what kind of arguments can be considered in the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge.\n\nDemocrats could use the budget process to remove the citizenship question from the survey.\n\nCould the budget battle be delayed?\n\nIn theory, yes.\n\nCongress could pass another short-term spending bill to keep the government running through early next year. That would allow House Republicans to avoid difficult decisions and dump them in the laps of House Democrats, who will take back the majority in January.\n\nOutgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in November that the GOP doesn\u2019t want more delays.\n\n\u201cWe still want to solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re elected to work for our constituents.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\n\nYou bet.\n\nThe government has shut down twice since Trump took office almost two years ago.\n\nThe government partially shut down for three days in January after an impasse in the Senate over federal funding.
