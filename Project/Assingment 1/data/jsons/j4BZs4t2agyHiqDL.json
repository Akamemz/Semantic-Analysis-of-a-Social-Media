Joaquin Castro ( D-Texas ) , a member of the House Intelligence Committee .\nIn an effort to mollify the growing pro-impeachment faction , Pelosi will hold a special members-only meeting Wednesday morning to fully brief lawmakers on House Democrats \u2019 sprawling oversight efforts and investigations .\n`` Speaker Pelosi strongly encourages your boss to attend , '' read a notice sent to members from her office late Tuesday , adding that the meeting would focus on `` the great '' victory Democrats won Monday regarding Trump 's financial records and `` other litigation . ''\nThe members-only huddle is Pelosi 's latest attempt to keep her caucus in line as the White House continues to fuel the conflict with the new House majority over its investigations and more Democrats speak out in favor of impeachment .\nTrump on Tuesday blocked his former White House counsel from testifying in a highly anticipated House Judiciary Committee hearing . Lawmakers on the panel , which has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings , said former White House counsel Don McGahn 's no-show was an `` inflection point '' in their thinking about what should happen next .\n`` I \u2019 m not saying this as the co-chair of the Progressive Caucus , '' said Rep. Pramila Jayapal ( D-Wash. ) , a member of the Judiciary Committee backing the push to open an impeachment inquiry .\n`` There are actually a lot of frontline members who are coming up to me and saying ... ' A situation in which the president and the administration can completely , not just undermine , but actually destroy the foundations of checks and balances is something we can \u2019 t live with . ' ''\nStill , there were some signs late Tuesday that Pelosi 's attempt to buttress leadership 's posture against impeachment was working .\nRep. Steve Cohen , a member of the Judiciary Committee , said he has drafted articles of impeachment and they 're `` ready to go . '' But the Tennessee Democrat later said that without Pelosi 's backing , `` it 's not going to happen . ''\nAnd Rep.

And the relative calm may be short-lived as House Democrats and the White House both opened new fronts in their ongoing war Tuesday .\nThe Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for two former administration aides \u2014 Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson \u2014 likely setting up another legal battle with Trump . House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff received a last-ditch attempt from the Justice Department to stave off a likely vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for a second time .\nTrump also moved to appeal a Monday court ruling requiring his accounting firm to turn over eight years ' worth of his financial records to the House Oversight Committee .\n`` I don \u2019 t know what the president \u2019 s lawyers have up their sleeve . I don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen . I \u2019 m just going to play it day by day , '' Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings ( D-Md . ) , said . `` I have not been running around declaring victory . I just want to do my job . I don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen . ''\nAnd Democrats are increasingly frustrated with their inability to secure testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller , who is so far wary of testifying .\nCalls for moving toward impeachment surfaced in multiple closed-door meetings Monday , as frustrated members of the Judiciary Committee and other rank-and-file Democrats vented about the White House \u2019 s repeated stonewalling of their investigations and urged Pelosi to begin the impeachment process .\n\u201c Yes , we do need to start an inquiry , \u201d said Rep.
