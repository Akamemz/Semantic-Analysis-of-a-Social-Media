    "content": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Dispirited over a Republican Party primary that has devolved into an ugly , damaging fight , some of the GOP \u2019 s biggest financiers are reevaluating whether to invest in the 2016 presidential contest at all .\nAmong those on the sidelines : Sheldon Adelson , the billionaire casino mogul who hosted the Republican Jewish Coalition \u2019 s spring meeting at his Venetian hotel this weekend . His apparent ambivalence about 2016 was shared by many RJC members here . With grave doubts about the viability of the few remaining Republican contenders , many of these Republican donors have decided to sit out the rest of the primary entirely . And while some are reluctantly getting behind a remaining candidate , others are shifting their attention to congressional contests .\nOn Friday morning , during a meeting of the group \u2019 s board , Arthur Finkelstein , an iconic Republican strategist who has advised numerous politicians over the past four decades , presented polling data that showed Donald Trump sitting at historically low approval numbers among American Jews , according to three attendees who described the off-the-record meeting . Ted Cruz , despite an aggressive recent push to court Jews , fared little better .\nFollowing the nearly 30-minute presentation , the group turned to a discussion about what \u2019 s next in the race . While some in the room spoke in favor of Cruz , others expressed reservations about his prospects in the general election . Trump , meanwhile , had little support : Not one person volunteered to raise money for him if he were the nominee .\nOver the course of the weekend , some of the party \u2019 s disappointed and most sought-after contributors said they may be done with the 2016 race . Mel Sembler , a Florida real estate executive and former U.S. ambassador , said that after helping to bankroll Jeb Bush \u2019 s campaign , he had turned his attention to defeating a local medical-marijuana initiative .\n\u201c That \u2019 s my focus for the rest of this year , \u201d he said .\nEasily the biggest holdout , though , is Adelson . Despite spending more than $ 100 million on the 2012 campaign \u2014 some of it on former House Speaker Newt Gingrich \u2019 s unsuccessful primary effort that year \u2014 the 82-year-old mogul has yet to pick a favorite 2016 candidate . His advisers say that he will not endorse anyone until the Republican nomination is decided , at the earliest .\nAdelson , an unpredictable and enigmatic figure who is the 22nd richest person in the world , has offered few hints about how he \u2019 ll try to influence the campaign . While the RJC spring meeting is traditionally a celebration of Adelson , with politicians of all stripes venturing to the Venetian to pay homage , this year \u2019 s was different .\nOn Thursday evening , Adelson hosted some of the organization \u2019 s top officials at his palatial mansion . While former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper discussed how fractured parties can unite , Adelson listened but said little , according to three people who were present .
