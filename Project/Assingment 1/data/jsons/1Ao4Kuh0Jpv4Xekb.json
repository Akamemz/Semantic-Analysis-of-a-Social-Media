    "content": "A federal appeals court ruled Thursday against a central provision of the Defense of Marriage Act , a groundbreaking decision that tees up a potential battle before the Supreme Court .\nThe three-judge panel of the 1st U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled that the provision defining marriage as between a man and woman is unconstitutional in that it denies gay couples the rights granted to heterosexual couples .\nThe unanimous decision once again brings the issue of gay marriage to the fore of the nation 's political debate . It comes just a few weeks after President Obama announced his support for gay marriage -- in the wake of that announcement , some gay advocacy groups have stepped up pressure on Washington to fight DOMA .\nConsidering the potential Supreme Court battle ahead , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked Thursday whether the Obama administration would actively fight for overturning the law , which was originally signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton .\nCarney noted that the Obama administration has concluded the section in question is unconstitutional and will no longer defend it in court . Without commenting on what steps the administration might take in the future , he described the Justice Department as an `` active participant '' in the case .\n`` There 's no question that this is in concert with the president 's views , '' he said . `` I ca n't predict what the next steps will be in handling cases of this nature . ''\nGay marriage advocates hailed Thursday 's decision , while its opponents condemned it .\n`` Society should protect and strengthen marriage , not undermine it . The federal Defense of Marriage Act provides that type of protection , and we trust the U.S. Supreme Court will reverse the 1st Circuit 's erroneous decision , '' said a statement from Alliance Defense Fund Legal Counsel Dale Schowengerdt .\nThe court did n't rule on the law 's more politically combustible provision , which said states without same-sex marriage can not be forced to recognize gay unions performed in states where it 's legal . It also was n't asked to address whether gay couples have a constitutional right to marry .\nThe law was passed at a time when it appeared Hawaii would legalize gay marriage . Since then , many states have instituted their own bans on gay marriage , while eight states have approved it , led by Massachusetts in 2004 .\nThe court , the first federal appeals panel to deem the benefits section of the law unconstitutional , agreed with a lower level judge who ruled in 2010 that the law interferes with the right of a state to define marriage and denies married gay couples federal benefits given to heterosexual married couples , including the ability to file joint tax returns .\nThe 1st Circuit said its ruling would n't be enforced until the U.S. Supreme Court decides the case , meaning that same-sex married couples will not be eligible to receive the economic benefits denied by DOMA until the high court rules .\nThat 's because the ruling only applies to states within the circuit , including Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Maine , New Hampshire and Puerto Rico .
