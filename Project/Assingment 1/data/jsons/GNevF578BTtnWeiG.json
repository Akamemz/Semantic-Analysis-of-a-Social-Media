Spokesmen for Sen. Harry Reid and Sen.

McConnell ... are optimistic that an agreement is within reach , '' said Adam Jentleson , a spokesman for Reid .\nAnd shortly after announcing around 10 p.m. Tuesday that the Senate was adjourning until noon Wednesday -- though this would n't preclude leaders from saying `` something nice '' before then to assuage financial markets , a Senate Democratic leadership aide said -- Reid sounded upbeat .\nThat optimism , as well as the bipartisan approach , is a far cry from what 's happening in the House .\nSources said Tuesday that House Speaker John Boehner had been `` struggling '' to come up with enough votes among his own members for a GOP counterproposal to the Senate plan -- even though the Ohio Republican himself said `` the idea of default is wrong . ''\nRep. Joe Barton , R-Texas , is among those Republicans who said he would n't back the measure being floated all day Tuesday , saying that it would n't get the 217 required votes to pass given that House Democrats have said they wo n't support it .\n`` There 's no structural reform .

It also would increase the federal debt ceiling until February 7 .\nIn addition , the House GOP version would 've included a provision demanded by tea party conservatives prohibiting federal subsidies for the President , his administration 's officials , members of Congress and their respective staffs to use toward purchasing health insurance under Obama 's signature health care reforms .\nRepublicans dropped demands to include two other provisions related to Obamacare . One would have delayed a tax on medical devices proponents say is needed to help pay for the Affordable Care Act , and the other would have tightened income verification of those seeking subsidies to purchase health insurance .\nThe House proposal also would have forbidden the Treasury from taking what it calls extraordinary measures to prevent the federal government from defaulting as cash runs low , in effect requiring hard deadlines to extend the federal debt ceiling .\nTwo senior House GOP sources told CNN 's Deirdre Walsh the House GOP counterproposal would have been passed in a way to let the Democratic-led Senate to strip provisions with a simple majority . Walsh and CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash explained that would make it harder for tea party conservatives such as GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to delay or derail the agreement .\nWhether this GOP plan is dead or not is n't known . As he left the Capitol , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said only that there would be `` no votes tonight . We 'll see you in the morning . ''\nBut one thing , for sure , is that Democrats -- including the White House , which has rejected the House GOP effort -- would have nothing to do with it .\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called the proposal `` a decision to default . '' And speaking on the Senate floor , Reid said , `` Extremist Republicans in the House of Representatives are attempting to torpedo the Senate 's bipartisan progress with a bill that ca n't pass the Senate . ''\nEven Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tennessee , said it was time to get a deal done after lengthy delays he blamed on the unrealistic goal set by GOP conservatives of gutting Obamacare .\n`` The fact is we 've got to figure out a way to move ahead , '' he told CNN 's `` New Day '' on Tuesday . `` In fairness , on our side of the aisle , we 've wasted two months , focused on something that was never going to happen . ''\nThe Senate is indeed moving ahead , with legislation that would give Republicans some concessions while overall being closer to what Obama and fellow Democrats have long pushed for regarding government funding and the debt ceiling .\nThe fight began when Republicans -- paced by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- insisted that they 'd only allow the government to open fully into the start of the fiscal year October 1 with amendments to defund or delay Obamacare .\nAlas , the only element of the Affordable Care Act that would change under the pending Senate deal is an anti-fraud provision requiring income verification for people getting federal subsidies , according to a Democratic source .\nEven if a deal is finalized soon , that does n't mean it will become law right away .\nThe earliest a vote might happen is late Thursday or in the pre-dawn hours of Friday , assuming Boehner sends a `` message '' allowing the Senate to expedite its vote .\nIf there 's not unanimous consent by senators -- in other words , if a tea party conservative like Cruz has an issue -- a final vote would be pushed to Saturday , at the earliest . The delay for a final Senate vote could stretch seven to 10 days , if some chamber members throw up yet more procedural hurdles .\nThe prolonged legislative process , not to mention the threat of yet more stalemate , could wreak havoc in financial circles .\nThe partial shutdown has proved costly , leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either idle at home or not being paid while working not to mention the costs of shuttered aid programs and closed parks .\nAnd it 's not just Americans who could be impacted without action to address the U.S. government 's debt situation .\nJon Cunliffe , who will become the deputy governor of the Bank of England , told British lawmakers over the weekend that banks should begin planning for contingencies .\nAnd officials warn that tough choices are ahead about which bills to pay and which to let slide , should the shutdown and debt ceiling debate drag on .\nEven before the deadline , the stalemate was taking its toll . Mark Zandi of Moody 's Analytics told CNN 's Christine Romans on Tuesday that the standoff has cost the economy about $ 20 billion in gross domestic product . GDP is a measure of the goods and services produced by an economy .",

Congress and the president are facing off in another supreme spending showdown. This last happened in 2011, when Congress avoided a shutdown by passing a spending measure shortly after the midnight deadline hit. Who controls what happens this time? Take a look at the key players who will determine how this fight ends.\n\n\n\n-- From CNN Capitol Hill Reporter Lisa Desjardins. CNN's Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett contributed to this report. Hide Caption 1 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina -- The architect. During Congress' August recess, the tea party-backed freshman wrote to Republican leaders suggesting that they tie dismantling Obamacare to the funding bill. Though initially rejected by GOP leadership, 79 of Meadows' House colleagues signed on to the letter, which quoted James Madison writing in the Federalist Papers, \"the power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon ... for obtaining a redress of every grievance.\" --The architect.

Though initially rejected by GOP leadership, 79 of Meadows' House colleagues signed on to the letter, which quoted James Madison writing in the Federalist Papers, \"the power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon ... for obtaining a redress of every grievance.\" Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio -- The coach. He'll make the key play call. The top Republican leader in the land may be the most important player in the days immediately before a possible shutdown. Boehner could decide whether to push through the Senate's version of a spending bill and keep government running, or he could float a third version with some other Republican wish list items in it. If he takes the second option, Boehner could risk a shutdown but could also force the Senate into a tough position: give House Republicans something or send federal workers home. Timing on all this will be critical. Hide Caption 3 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- The revolutionary or rabble rouser, depending on your viewpoint. The tea party firebrand could lead a long filibuster on the Senate floor, delaying passage of a spending bill until just one day before the deadline on Monday, September 30. Cruz has stoked the anti-Obamacare flames all summer, but recently angered fellow Republicans by openly saying that the Senate does not have the votes to repeal the health care law. Hide Caption 4 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida -- Senator to watch. The potential presidential candidate has been one of three senators (Cruz and Mike Lee, R-Utah, being the others) pushing to use the government shutdown debate as a way to repeal or defund Obamacare. But watch his actions and language as a shutdown nears to see if he digs in or if downshifts at all. Hide Caption 5 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada -- The man steering the ship in the Senate. Master at using Senate procedure to his advantage, Reid is the main force in controlling the voting process in the chamber and ensuring that an attempted filibuster by tea party-types fails. The majority leader will be a primary negotiator if we reach phase three, if the House does not accept the Senate spending bill. Hide Caption 6 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky -- If Reid steers the ship, McConnell controls the headwinds. Which is good news for Reid, at least initially. The Republican leader and several of his members say they will vote against Cruz's filibuster and in favor of a spending bill with no limits on Obamacare. Meaning, in favor of a bill that just funds government. McConnell generally has been leery of running into a shutdown or default. In fact, one legislative method for avoiding default is named after him. Hide Caption 7 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington -- The consigliore. Murray, center, does not seek the outside limelight, but the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman is a major fiscal force behind the scenes on Capitol Hill. Known by fellow Democrats as a straight shooter, she is also an experienced negotiator, having co-chaired the laborious, somewhat torturous and unsuccessful Super Committee. Hide Caption 8 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia -- The new militia leader. The freshman congressman from Georgia, second from right, is one reason the debate has reached this point. Graves led the charge that blocked the original proposal by House Republican leaders. That would have kept government funded and had a detachable portion on Obamacare. Instead Graves and other conservatives forced their leaders to pass a spending bill with a mandatory defunding of Obamacare. Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Peter King, R-New York -- The blunt statesman. King is outspoken against many tea party tactics, calling the move to tie Obamacare to the must-pass spending bill essentially a suicide mission and Cruz \"a fraud.\" He is pushing for Republicans to accept a more \"clean\" spending bill that can pass the Senate and avoid a shutdown. Hide Caption 10 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Thomas Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- The heavy. Donohue is known for his deep connections and his aggressive lobbying on behalf of business. He and the Chamber are urging Republican lawmakers to avoid a shutdown. The Chamber is an important political backer for conservatives, but has had mixed success with the current Congress, locking in firm anti-tax positions but unable to push through immigration reform so far. Hide Caption 11 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Michael Needham, president of Heritage Action -- The driving force. Needham runs the political offshoot of the conservative Heritage Foundation and has been unrelenting in urging lawmakers to repeal Obamacare. He has told Republicans not to fear a potential shutdown, saying they would suffer more politically from allowing Obamacare to continue. Hide Caption 12 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 President Barack Obama -- The campaigner and CEO. Expect the president to use his podium more as a shutdown nears, aiming at public opinion as Democrats in Congress position themselves. If House Republicans send back a new proposal close to the September 30 deadline, the president and Democrats will have to decide what move to make next. Hide Caption 13 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia -- The powerful lieutenant. Cantor, the House Republican No. 2, is much more closely allied with conservatives and tea party members in the House than is Speaker Boehner. The two have not always agreed on every strategy during potential shutdown debates, but have been in public lockstep during the current go-around. Hide Caption 14 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland -- Players on deck. The top two House Democrats are mostly watching and waiting. But they will play a critical role once Boehner decides his next move. They could either bring Democratic votes on board a deal or be the loudest voices against a new Republican alternative. Hoyer will be interesting to watch; he has strongly opposed both the House and Senate plans as cutting too much in spending. Hide Caption 15 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California -- The numbers guy. McCarthy, the House whip, has the tricky job of assessing exactly where Republican members stand and getting the 217 votes it takes to pass a bill in the chamber. He is known for his outreach to and connection with many of the freshmen House members who align with the tea party. Hide Caption 16 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin -- Member to watch. The vote of the House budget chairman and former vice presidential nominee is an important signal both within Republican ranks and to the public at large. Ryan has voted against some funding measures in the past, including the emergency aid for Superstorm Sandy recovery. But he was a \"yes\" on the last extension of the debt ceiling. Hide Caption 17 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate \u2013 Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida -- Another member to watch. A former committee chairwoman (Republican rules have term limits for committee chairs), Ros-Lehtinen knows House politics and procedure inside out. Depending on the issue, she has been described as a conservative or moderate, and occasionally as a libertarian.

Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said it was time to get a deal done after lengthy delays he blamed on the unrealistic goal set by GOP conservatives of gutting Obamacare.\n\n\"The fact is we've got to figure out a way to move ahead,\" he told CNN's \"New Day\" on Tuesday. \"In fairness, on our side of the aisle, we've wasted two months, focused on something that was never going to happen.\"\n\nWorld watching Washington\n\nThe Senate is indeed moving ahead, with legislation that would give Republicans some concessions while overall being closer to what Obama and fellow Democrats have long pushed for regarding government funding and the debt ceiling.\n\nThe fight began when Republicans -- paced by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas -- insisted that they'd only allow the government to open fully into the start of the fiscal year October 1 with amendments to defund or delay Obamacare.\n\nAlas, the only element of the Affordable Care Act that would change under the pending Senate deal is an anti-fraud provision requiring income verification for people getting federal subsidies, according to a Democratic source.\n\nEven if a deal is finalized soon, that doesn't mean it will become law right away.\n\nThe earliest a vote might happen is late Thursday or in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, assuming Boehner sends a \"message\" allowing the Senate to expedite its vote.\n\nIf there's not unanimous consent by senators -- in other words, if a tea party conservative like Cruz has an issue -- a final vote would be pushed to Saturday, at the earliest. The delay for a final Senate vote could stretch seven to 10 days, if some chamber members throw up yet more procedural hurdles.\n\nThe prolonged legislative process, not to mention the threat of yet more stalemate, could wreak havoc in financial circles.\n\nThe partial shutdown has proved costly, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either idle at home or not being paid while working not to mention the costs of shuttered aid programs and closed parks.\n\nAnd it's not just Americans who could be impacted without action to address the U.S. government's debt situation.\n\nJon Cunliffe, who will become the deputy governor of the Bank of England, told British lawmakers over the weekend that banks should begin planning for contingencies.\n\nAnd officials warn that tough choices are ahead about which bills to pay and which to let slide, should the shutdown and debt ceiling debate drag on.\n\nEven before the deadline, the stalemate was taking its toll. Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics told CNN's Christine Romans on Tuesday that the standoff has cost the economy about $20 billion in gross domestic product. GDP is a measure of the goods and services produced by an economy.",
