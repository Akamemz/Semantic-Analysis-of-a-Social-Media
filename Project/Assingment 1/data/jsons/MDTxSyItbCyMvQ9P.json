    "content": "Reports of road rage incidents resulting in gun violence are on the rise . In fact , they are now so common that newspapers report them as if they are fender benders . Here 's a typical report from Thursday :\nAccording to Baytown police , a 27-year-old man was riding in the passenger seat of a Honda Accord being driven by his 24-year-old brother-in-law . The men said an older-model green BMW almost struck them in the 3600 block of West Baker . The brother-in-law then drove to catch up with the BMW and words were exchanged . An occupant in the BMW began shooting into the Honda , striking the passenger in the face . The victim was taken to Houston Methodist San Jacinto Hospital in stable condition .\nSimilarly , YouTube commonly features videos of irate drivers pulling guns on freeways . ( Although , to be fair , it 's nearly impossible to verify if these are true incidents . )\nNew laws that allow the open carry of loaded guns in public places -- and such laws are springing up all over the nation -- have resulted in even more terrifying confrontations : For example , parents are forced to deal with gun activists brandishing their firearms in front of their kids in a public park , shouting : `` Look at my gun ! There 's nothing you can do about it ! '' Likewise , workers in businesses serving the public are forced to deal with customers blithely slinging loaded semi-automatic weapons over their shoulders , or casually leaning firearms up against tables . These owners have little recourse but to pray they do n't become the victim of one of the thousands of firearm-related accidents that occur all over the country every year .\nBut never let it be said that the gun rights zealots are totally rigid in their thinking and have no common sense at all . I have written in the past about the odd hypocrisy of gun proliferation advocates in Republican state houses who refuse to people the right to carry firearms in their work places , even as they pass laws making everyone else work in a world where an angry person with a gun might very well lose his or her temper and decide to make their point with a bullet .\nThe standard answer of such lawmakers is that politics -- unlike road rage or any other kind of everyday beef that humans are prone to provoke -- is a uniquely contentious job ; and therefore , having guns around is more dangerous for them than it is for the general public .
