    "content": "Congressional leaders struck a deal they thought would be enticing enough to avoid another government shutdown Thursday . But as lawmakers barrel toward the midnight deadline , when the government runs out of money , it \u2019 s still not clear there \u2019 s enough support to keep the government running .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal on budget caps Wednesday that would make increase investments in domestic programs and the military by roughly $ 300 billion over the next two years : The deal lifts funding for domestic programs by $ 128 billion and hikes defense budgets by $ 160 billion . This budget caps deal would be attached to a short-term spending bill through the end of March , to give lawmakers time to write the specific appropriations bills , and also increase the debt ceiling for one year .\nBut the agreement sets aside the question of immigration and what to do about the sunsetting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which was at the heart of the standoff in January that ended in a three-day shutdown .\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she and a significant number of Democrats would vote against the budget deal if House Speaker Paul Ryan didn \u2019 t give assurances of a vote on a DACA fix . Meanwhile , enough House conservatives , concerned about a massive spending increase , say they are voting against the budget deal . That means Republican leaders actually need Democrats to support the budget agreement in the House .\nRyan has refused to give Pelosi firm assurances on immigration , and negotiations on DACA have largely stalled , stuck between the moderate-but-passable proposals that the White House won \u2019 t support and conservative Trump-endorsed proposals that won \u2019 t see the light of day in the Senate \u2014 the same dynamics as the run-up to the shutdown two weeks ago .\nDemocrats do not have the same appetite to go through with a government shutdown as they did two weeks ago , and they are under less pressure from advocates to get a deal on DACA at any cost . But we \u2019 re seeing the rare occasion where House Democrats have enough leverage over a shutdown to make policy demands .\nThere \u2019 s a bipartisan budget caps deal that \u2019 s both a success and causing a lot of trouble\nCongressional Leaders have come to a massive budget caps deal that would amount to significant increases in spending for domestic programs and the military over the next two years .\nExtend funding for the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program for 10 years\nPut $ 6 billion in funding towards opioid and mental health treatment .\n$ 5.8 billion for the bipartisan Child Care Development Block Grant .\n$ 4 billion towards the Veterans Administration to rebuild and improve veterans hospitals and clinics .\n$ 2 billion towards research at the National Institutes of Health .\n$ 20 billion towards infrastructure , including highways , water , wastewater and rural broadband .\n$ 4 billion toward college affordability programs for police officers , teachers and firefighters .\n$ 7 billion in funding and a two year reauthorization for Community Health Centers .\nThis agreement is the result of a fight that goes back to 2011 when an Obama-era impasse over the debt ceiling brought the American economy to near calamity , which ultimately resulted in the 2013 sequester , setting into law across-the-board budget cuts and establishing budget caps that would amount to $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years .\nCongress has repeatedly voted to raise the budget caps . Since the 2013 sequester , there have been two bipartisan deals to raise the caps by billions of dollars . The first in 2013 was forged between Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Patty Murray ; a second was agreed on in 2015 . But those adjustments , which extended through fiscal year 2017 , have now expired .\nIn 2018 , the sequester budget caps max out defense spending at $ 549 billion and non-defense discretionary funding at $ 516 billion , far less than what both Republicans and Democrats would like to spend . This deal would increase those numbers by more than $ 80 and $ 60 billion per year , respectively .\nReaching a budget cap deal is a high priority for defense hawks in Congress , who say short-term spending deals hobble the military , preventing them from being able to adequately plan resources . But it has also proven to be a victory for Democrats . Despite negotiating under a Republican-led government , Democrats are seeing increases in funding for domestic programs , that cover everything from health care , to education and environmental protections . The latter has angered conservatives , who are okay with boosting military funding but say the increases to domestic spending takes too big a toll on the national debt .\nRepublicans need Democratic votes to raise the budget caps on military spending and domestic programs to meet the Senate \u2019 s 60-vote threshold . With these budget caps , appropriators \u2014 the lawmakers in charge of the nation \u2019 s purse strings \u2014 can begin putting together a trillion-dollar spending bill that would fund the government through next September , are stalled . Writing long term appropriations bills could take a month .\nShortly before Senate leaders announced they would vote on a budget deal that would fund the government through the end of March , extend funding for community health centers for two years and also substantially boost the budget caps for defense and domestic programs , Pelosi said she wanted Ryan to make her the same promise Mitch McConnell made Senate Democrats two weeks ago : a guaranteed vote on an immigration bill that addresses DACA .\n\u201c Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell , this package does not have my support , \u201d Pelosi said in a statement , coming out against the deal she helped negotiate .\nBut Pelosi , and House Democrats aren \u2019 t the only lawmakers standing against the budget deal .\nAlready conservative deficit hawks in the House have sounded the alarm bells over what is looking like a significant spending hike \u2014 roughly $ 300 billion more in defense and non-defense funding over the next two years . The Freedom caucus , a group of 40 House conservatives , have come out against the deal . In other words , Republicans in the House need Democratic support for any short-term spending deal that includes a budget caps agreement .\nBut Ryan has pledged he won \u2019 t bring up any immigration bill that doesn \u2019 t have the majority of his party \u2019 s support \u2014 called the Hastert Rule \u2014 or President Donald Trump \u2019 s blessing , neither of which bode well for House Democrats .\nWith an archconservative revolt , House Democrats increasingly see this as their opportunity to put Ryan \u2019 s feet to the fire on immigration . Pelosi and Democratic leadership have gone back and forth on whipping their members against the budget deal , but the leader \u2019 s own decision to stand against the deal has proven persuasive .\n\u201c Anyone that underestimates the ability of Nancy Pelosi to influence the Democratic Caucus shouldn \u2019 t be in the business that you are in , \u201d Rep. Brad Sherman ( D-CA ) told reporters Thursday .\nCongress still doesn \u2019 t appear any closer to an actual deal on immigration\nWhen Democrats and Republicans voted to reopen the government , the idea was they would spend the following weeks cobbling together a deal on immigration and more permanent government spending in the weeks ahead .\nBut the actual legislative calendar shrank that window for negotiation , and talks have since increasingly splintered .\nTwo weeks ago , Trump \u2019 s administration briefed Republican congressional aides with an immigration proposal that called for a path to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children , $ 25 billion to fund a Southern border wall , substantial curtailing of family immigration , and the elimination of the diversity visa lottery program , which would gut the legal immigration system .\nThe proposal was largely interpreted as a White House alternative to the one bipartisan proposal by Durbin and Sen.

By the following week , House Republicans were still discussing the partisan immigration proposal by Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R-VA ) , which is unlikely to garner any Democratic support . And already some Republicans in the Senate have expressed concern with the proposal \u2019 s serious cuts to legal immigration .\nMeanwhile , several other groups have also continued negotiations on completely separate tracks :\nThe shutdown also brought together a larger group of bipartisan negotiators \u2014 roughly 30 senators who \u2019 ve named themselves the \u201c Common Sense Coalition , \u201d who are intent on moving immigration talks forward but have yet to come forward with a proposal .\nThe team of Democratic and Republican leadership deputies that have been dubbed the \u201c No . 2s , \u201d consisting of Durbin again , as well as Minority Whip Rep.
