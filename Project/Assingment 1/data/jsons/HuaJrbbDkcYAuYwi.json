    "content": "Democrats have begun an all-out push to move a new assault weapons ban through Congress . But it faces strong headwinds from House Republicans , Democrats in pro-gun rights states and many legislatures in western and southern states who are moving in a different direction to ease gun control , rather than strengthen it .\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee , chaired by the bill 's author , Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein , heard emotional testimony Wednesday from a witness list stacked with pro-ban speakers -- none more powerful than Neil Heslin of Newtown , Conn. , whose son Jesse , was killed in the elementary school massacre . He pointed to his forehead and told the hushed hearing panel about the bullet that struck just below Jesse 's hairline .\n`` Jesse looked at coward Adam Lanza in the eyes , saw his face and he looked at the end of that barrel , Jesse did n't run , Jesse didn \u2019 t turn his back . That was the fatal shot that killed Jesse , '' he said .\nDemocrats are pushing for a new gun ban that would limit , among other things , 157 types of so-called assault weapons and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition . When asked if there is a constitutionally protected right for someone to own a gun with that kind of capacity to kill , John Walsh , the U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado speaking on behalf of the Justice Department , said , `` There clearly is room for reasonable regulation particularly of dangerous and unusual weapons . ''\nThat phrase , `` dangerous and unusual weapons , '' is key to the Democrats ' strategy of seeking a new ban that withstands court challenges . In the Supreme Court 's Heller decision , which struck down the District of Columbia 's handgun ban , Justice Antonin Scalia referenced a 1939 U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave Second Amendment protection to weapons `` in common use at the time '' of its being written .\nScalia wrote , `` We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of 'dangerous and unusual weapons . ' ''\nClearly , Democrats think that a magazine with more than 10 rounds , containing bullets that can do serious damage , qualifies as `` dangerous and unusual . ''\nBut Republicans argue that those weapons are hardly unusual if in the possession of millions of Americans . There are presently more than 4 million AR 15 's in American homes alone , and many more millions of excess-capacity magazines\nRather than create new laws that impinge on the Second Amendment , one Republicans asked why existing laws are not better enforced . Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , asked Walsh how many people who had failed gun background checks had been referred to state prosecutions .\nWalsh said , `` Senator , I don \u2019 t have a particular number on that . ''\nGraham replied , using the most recent DOJ statistics . `` Almost 80,000 people failed background checks and 44 people are prosecuted , what kind of deterrent is that ? '' he asked .\nRepublican Sen. Charles Grassley asked why a second assault weapons ban is needed , when a Justice Department study found the effects of the first ban to be inconclusive .\n`` They can not clearly credit the ban with any of the nation 's recent drop in gun violence , '' he said .\nThe push for a new assault weapons ban occurs as some states are jockeying to block a federal assault weapons ban -- while others are moving to enhance it .\nIn Illinois , the state legislature has begun a series of votes on a concealed-carry law , after an appeals court ruled the state ban on concealed weapons was unconstitutional . In South Dakota , the Senate has extended permits for concealed weapons from four to five years . In Texas , a new bill would protect state law officers from having to enforce a new federal gun ban .\nOne of its sponsors , Rep. Steve Toth , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , `` Dozens and dozens of county sheriffs from around the state of Texas said we 're not going to abide by this . This sets up a problem because if , in fact , this legislation does go through , they would be subject to prosecution by Eric Holder and the Justice Department -- so we 've got to protect them . ''\nBut there are 23 other states that currently have an `` assault weapons ban '' or have similar legislation currently pending in their legislature .\nThe NRA 's Jacqueline Otto tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 , `` This is very difficult to measure because anti-gun legislators are always trying to add anti-gun amendments to other pieces of legislation , so bill descriptions are changing constantly .
