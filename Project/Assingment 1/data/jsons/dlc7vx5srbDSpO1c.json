    "content": "Today is International Workers \u2019 Day , a holiday with socialist origins . Its name hearkens back to a time when the political Left was ostensibly devoted to the cause of human welfare . These days , however , some on the far Left care less about the wellbeing of people than they do about making sure that people are never born at all . How did these radicals come to support a massive reduction in human population , if not humanity \u2019 s demise ? Whether it \u2019 s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioning the morality of childbearing , a birth-strike movement that encourages people to forego parenthood despite the \u201c grief that [ they say they ] feel as a result , \u201d or political commentator Bill Maher blithely claiming , \u201c I can \u2019 t think of a better gift to our planet than pumping out fewer humans to destroy it , \u201d a misanthropic philosophy known as \u201c anti-natalism \u201d is going increasingly mainstream .\nThe logical conclusion of this anti-humanist ideology is , depressingly , the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement ( Vhemt ) . According to its founder , activist Les Knight , Vhemt ( pronounced \u201c vehement \u201d ) is gaining steam . \u201c In the last year , \u201d Knight told the Daily Mail , \u201c I \u2019 ve seen more and more articles about people choosing to remain child-free or to not add more to their existing family than ever . I \u2019 ve been collecting these stories and last year was just a groundswell of articles , and , in addition , there have been articles about human extinction . \u201d\nOver 2000 new people have \u201c liked \u201d the movement \u2019 s Facebook page since January and , more importantly , the number of people fulfilling the movement \u2019 s goals ( regardless of any affiliation with the movement itself ) is growing . The U.S. birth rate is at an all-time low . According to the latest figures from the Center for Disease Control , the total U.S. fertility rate for 2017 was at an all-time low of 1.77 babies per woman ( i.e. , below the replacement rate of 2.1 babies per woman needed to maintain the current population ) .\nRecent examples of writings that are warming to the idea of human extinction include the New Yorker \u2019 s \u201c The Case for Not Being Born , \u201d NBC News \u2019 \u201c Science proves kids are bad for Earth . Morality suggests we stop having them , \u201d and the New York Times \u2019 \u201c Would Human Extinction Be a Tragedy ? \u201d which muses that , \u201c It may well be , then , that the extinction of humanity would make the world better off. \u201d Last month , the progressive magazine FastCompany released a disturbing video entitled , \u201c Why Having Kids Is the Worst Thing You Can Do for the Planet . \u201d\nSome anti-natalists are not content with promoting the voluntary reduction of birth rates , and would prefer to hurry the process along with government intervention . Various prominent environmentalists , from Johns Hopkins University bioethicist Travis Rieder to science popularizer and entertainer Bill Nye , support the introduction of special taxes or other state-imposed penalties for having \u201c too many \u201d children . In 2015 , Bowdoin College \u2019 s Sarah Conly published a book advocating a \u201c one-child \u201d policy , like the one China abandoned following disastrous consequences including female infanticide and a destabilizing gender ratio of 120 boys per 100 girls , which left around 17 percent of China \u2019 s young men unable to find a Chinese wife . Even after that barbaric policy \u2019 s collapse , she maintains it was \u201c a good thing . \u201d\nModern-day anti-humanism emerged in the 1970s , midwifed by a doomy strain of environmental pessimism led by Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich ( but with intellectual antecedents dating back to Thomas Malthus in the eighteenth century ) . Ehrlich published his widely read polemic The Population Bomb in 1968 , which originally opened with the lines , \u201c The battle to feed all of humanity is over . In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now . \u201d\nThanks to human ingenuity in the form of the Green Revolution , that didn \u2019 t happen . The challenge of feeding a growing population led instead to technological innovation and that produced a solution : higher agricultural productivity and falling food prices . Far from leading to starvation , more humans exchanging ideas and innovating have ensured that the supply of food rose to meet growing demand . Ehrlich quietly removed his failed prognostication from subsequent editions of his book , but his ideas caught on among some strands of the environmentalist movement .\nUndeterred , Ehrlich and many likeminded doomsayers are still claiming that disaster is imminent , despite their previous predictions repeatedly failing to materialize . Just last year , Ehrlich compared human population growth to the spread of cancer , informing the Guardian , \u201c It is a near certainty in the next few decades , and the risk is increasing continually as long as perpetual growth of the human enterprise remains the goal of economic and political systems \u2026 As I \u2019 ve said many times , \u2018 perpetual growth is the creed of the cancer cell . \u2019 \u201d\nOnce anti-humanism had infected the environmental movement , it soon spread through the political Left . Robert Zubrin \u2019 s book Merchants of Despair gives an overview of the Left \u2019 s reversal of its traditional commitment to advancing the human condition , in favor of a project that viewed humanity as a plague upon the Earth :\nInstead of The Grapes of Wrath , they carried copies of The Population Bomb \u2026 Instead of \u201c Stop the War , \u201d their buttons read \u201c Stop at two \u201d [ children ] ; instead of \u201c Power to the people , \u201d their slogan was \u201c People pollute . \u201d\nThese environmentally-concerned anti-natalists believe that a world without humans , or with significantly fewer of them , would eventually revert to a pollution-free paradise with abundant natural resources . As one human extinction proponent put it just last month in a letter to his local paper , \u201c In approximately 20,000 years after human extinction , this magnificent resistant biosphere will return to its perfection. \u201d If humanity fails to reduce its numbers , extinction proponents fear resource shortages and environmental catastrophe . \u201c How could anybody , \u201d an official Vhemt member , Gwynn Mackellen , wondered aloud to the Guardian , \u201c produce a new human when the effects of humans are very obvious , I feel , and the situation is getting worse . \u201d\nThese extinction advocates , however , have misunderstood the evidence about population growth \u2019 s impact on the planet and its resources . The late University of Maryland economist Julian Simon rejected the idea of overpopulation as a problem . He believed that , on the contrary , more people in the world means more people to solve problems , and less resource scarcity . \u201c There is no physical or economic reason , \u201d he wrote , \u201c why human resourcefulness and enterprise can not forever continue to respond to impending shortages and existing problems with new expedients that , after an adjustment period , leave us better off than before the problem arose . \u201d\nIn his 1981 book The Ultimate Resource , Simon argued that humans are intelligent beings , capable of innovating their way out of shortages through greater efficiency , increased supply , or development of substitutes . Humans , with their inventive potential , are themselves , in Simon \u2019 s phrase , \u201c The Ultimate Resource. \u201d A growing population produces more ideas . More ideas lead to more innovations and more innovations can improve productivity . That higher productivity then translates into more resources to go around and better standards of living .\nIn 1980 , Simon made a bet with Ehrlich . Ehrlich would choose a \u201c basket \u201d of raw materials that he expected to become more scarce in the coming years . At the end of a specified time period , if the inflation-adjusted price of the basket was higher than at the beginning of the period , that would indicate the materials had indeed become scarcer and Ehrlich would win the wager ; if the price was lower , that would mean the resources had instead become more abundant , and Simon would win . The stakes would be the ultimate price difference of the basket at the beginning and end of the time period . Simon ultimately won , and Ehrlich duly sent him a check for the price difference .\nNew research , inspired by the Ehrlich-Simon wager , has further confirmed that , contrary to the anti-humanists \u2019 claims , population growth goes hand-in-hand with more abundant resources . Consider the amount of time it takes an average worker to earn enough to buy a basket of common commodities\u2014the \u201c time-price \u201d of those items . The Simon Abundance Index found that between 1980 and 2017 , \u201c the time-price of our basket of 50 basic commodities declined by 0.934 percent for every one percent increase in population . That means that every additional human being born on our planet seems to be making resources proportionately more plentiful for the rest of us . \u201d\nThere are some notable environmentalists who recognize the fact that humans are capable of creating abundance instead of scarcity . Environmentalists who take the rational and techno-optimistic view , sometimes called \u201c enlightenment environmentalists \u201d or \u201c ecomodernists , \u201d still believe in humanity \u2019 s ability to tackle environmental problems with innovation and ingenuity . Examples include Harvard University \u2019 s Steven Pinker and the Breakthrough Institute \u2019 s Michael Shellenberger , who both hold that technologies such as nuclear power can reduce emissions . And the research of Rockefeller University environmental science professor Jesse H. Ausubel , who was integral to setting up the world \u2019 s first climate change conference in Geneva in 1979 , has shown how technological progress can allow nature to rebound , even while food and other resources have become more plentiful .\nUnfortunately , ecomodernists are still a minority within the environmental movement . Too many people , mostly on the political Left , still agree with Ehrlich that humans are analogous to cancer cells and long for the reduction or even extinction of our species . One third of Americans in the millennial generation say they are deeply concerned about the environmental impact of having children . Not that long ago , well within the living memory of a millennial such as myself , a 2002 episode of Aaron Sorkin \u2019 s popular political drama The West Wing could still quip that \u201c Death is bad \u201d remained a left-wing position . The scriptwriter took it for granted that , on the political Left , everyone is in favor of human flourishing .
