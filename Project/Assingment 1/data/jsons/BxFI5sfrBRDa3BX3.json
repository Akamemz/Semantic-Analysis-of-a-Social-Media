    "content": "The Trump administration and its domestic political allies are laying the groundwork for a possible confrontation with Iran without the explicit consent of Congress \u2014 a public relations campaign that was already well underway before top officials accused the Islamic Republic of attacking a pair of oil tankers last week in the Gulf of Oman .\nOver the past few months , senior Trump aides have made the case in public and private that the administration already has the legal authority to take military action against Iran , citing a law nearly two decades old that was originally intended to authorize the war in Afghanistan .\nIn the latest sign of escalating tensions , national security adviser John Bolton warned Iran in an interview conducted last week and published Monday , \u201c They would be making a big mistake if they doubted the president 's resolve on this. \u201d Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan announced on Monday evening that the U.S. was deploying an additional 1,000 troops to the region for \u201c defensive purposes. \u201d And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo jetted to Tampa , Fla. , home of Central Command , on Monday evening to huddle with military officials to discuss \u201c regional security concerns and ongoing operations , \u201d according to a State Department spokeswoman .\nThe developments came as Iran announced it was on course to violate a core element of its nuclear deal with major world powers , exceeding the amount of enriched uranium allowed under the agreement in 10 days unless European nations intervened to blunt the economic pain of American sanctions . And they came as U.S. officials promoted video footage and images showing what they say were Iranian forces planting explosive devices on commercial oil tankers .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

The president , who campaigned against getting the U.S. bogged down in unnecessary foreign wars , is considered the primary internal obstacle to a counterattack , officials said , noting that Trump continues to press for an improved nuclear deal .\nTrump on Monday de-emphasized the international significance of the recent tanker explosions in an interview with Time magazine \u2014 downplaying the Gulf of Oman 's value to U.S. oil supplies and describing alleged Iranian acts of aggression as `` very minor . ''\n\u201c If you look at the rhetoric now compared to the days when they were signing [ the 2015 nuclear deal ] , where it was always \u2018 death to America , death to America , we will destroy America , we will kill America , \u2019 I \u2019 m not hearing that too much anymore , \u201d Trump told Time . \u201c And I don \u2019 t expect to . \u201d\nStill , to the alarm of Democrats and some Republicans , Pompeo has suggested that if the administration does take military action , it might rely on the 2001 congressional bill that greenlighted America \u2019 s military response to the 9/11 attacks to strike Iran . Asked Sunday by CBS host Margaret Brennan whether the administration believed it had the authority to initiate military action , Pompeo would say only , \u201c Every option we look at will be fully lawful . \u201d\nAnd Sen. Tom Cotton ( R-Ark . ) , a close ally of the administration , urged the president to attack Iran outright \u2014 adding that he didn \u2019 t need permission from Congress . \u201c Unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike , '' Cotton told Brennan . \u201c The president has the authorization to act to defend American interests , \u201d he said .\nBut in a sign of some unease among other Republicans , Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she expected to discuss the legitimacy of that justification \u2014 and of military retaliation itself \u2014 with her Senate colleagues this week .\nTrump has sent conflicting messages about his own intentions \u2014 one day signaling his desire to negotiate with the clerical regime in Tehran , the next dismissing Iran as unready for serious talks . \u201c While I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , \u201d Trump tweeted last Thursday , \u201c I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal . They are not ready , and neither are we ! \u201d\n\u201c The regime in Tehran is testing American patience with violence in the Gulf , \u201d said Jonathan Schanzer , senior vice president at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies . \u201c The administration now has to weigh its options . \u201d\nIn some of Pompeo \u2019 s recent pronouncements , many on the left , and a few on the right , see the Trump team paving a path to war .\nIn April , the State Department named the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization , a legal designation that some fear could be used to link the elite paramilitary force with al-Qaida . Later , Pompeo also said Iran had \u201c instigated \u201d a May 31 suicide attack on a U.S. convoy in Afghanistan , even though the Taliban claimed credit for the incident .\nPressed by CBS \u2019 Brennan on Sunday , Pompeo reiterated the claim . \u201c [ W ] e have confidence that Iran instigated this attack , \u201d he said . \u201c I ca n't share any more of the intelligence . But I would n't have said it if the intelligence community had n't become convinced that this was the case . \u201d\nThe secretary of State \u2019 s efforts to link Iran and al-Qaida and to terrorism more broadly have become a flashpoint in multiple congressional hearings this spring \u2014 and they have taken on renewed significance given the growing possibility of a military confrontation between the two countries .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not surprising that you have a kind of revisitation of the AUMF because here you have what looks like the potential for a kind of real escalation , \u201d said Dennis Ross , the veteran Middle East negotiator , referring to the 2001 bill that authorized military action against any national or individual involved in the 9/11 attacks .\n\u201c In the 2001 AUMF , there \u2019 s actually no real relationship to this , \u201d Ross added . \u201c It certainly didn \u2019 t name Iran and there comes a point where many in Congress want to have oversight over getting into a shooting war with Iran . \u201d\nAs the president \u2019 s senior national security advisers huddled on Monday to consider how to respond to Iran , it was unclear how close the U.S. was inching to military action . Schanzer , for one , cast skepticism on an unattributed report in the Jerusalem Post on Monday that the U.S. had drawn up plans for a limited bombing campaign against an Iranian nuclear facility .\nA senior administration official said Monday that the goal of the administration \u2019 s maximum pressure policy remains forcing the regime back to the table to negotiate a new and improved nuclear deal .\nIran has thus far been careful to avoid attacks on American vessels \u2014 an internal administration red line that would force a military response , this official said . Administration allies including FDD \u2019 s chief executive , Mark Dubowitz , said that while he expects U.S. sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to increase , it is less clear whether military action will result absent a direct attack against an American ship or an American citizen .\nThe president himself is caught between competing impulses : his disdain for the 2015 deal the Obama administration struck with Iran and his desire to strike a contrast , on the one hand , and his reluctance to get into another war in the Middle East on the other . He has long been more skittish than his hawkish advisers about ratcheting up tensions , but he sent a blunt warning to Iran \u2019 s leaders last month that \u201c If they do anything it would be a very bad mistake . \u201d\nLast week , two lawmakers \u2014 Trump ally Matt Gaetz ( R-Fla. ) and Elissa Slotkin ( D-Mich. ) \u2014 said that Pompeo had invoked the 2001 AUMF in a closed-door briefing with lawmakers about Iran , suggesting the administration could use it as a legal justification for war .\n\u201c We were absolutely presented with a full formal presentation on how the 2001 AUMF might authorize war on Iran , \u201d Slotkin said . \u201c Secretary Pompeo said it with his own words . ''\nExiting an earlier closed-door briefing on May 21 by Shanahan , Rep.

Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) pushed Pompeo in that hearing to pledge that the administration would not rely on the 18-year-old war authorization to attack Iran , the secretary demurred , saying he would \u201c prefer to leave that to the lawyers . ''\n\u201c I can tell you explicitly you have not been given power or authority by Congress to have a war with Iran and in any kind of semblance of a sane world you would have to come back and ask us before you go into Iran , \u201d Paul retorted .\nRep.
