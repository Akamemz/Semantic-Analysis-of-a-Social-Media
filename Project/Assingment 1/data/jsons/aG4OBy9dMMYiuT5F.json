In a game dominated by passing, Mr. Brown is one of the best wide receivers in the National Football League. But three days after joining the 2019 Super Bowl champs, Mr. Brown became the latest moral test of the NFL\u2019s commitment to address violence against women by its players.\n\n1. What\u2019s the case against Antonio Brown?\n\nA civil lawsuit filed Sept. 10 accuses him of two incidents of sexual battery in 2017 and a rape in 2018. He denies the allegations, and a statement by his lawyer says that Mr. Brown had a \u201cconsensual personal relationship\u201d with his accuser, Britney Taylor. The two were friends in college, and later he hired her as a personal trainer. Mr. Brown reportedly turned down an offer to settle the suit for $2 million. Another sexual misconduct allegation against Mr. Brown surfaced this week.\n\n2. Could another NFL team hire Mr. Brown?\n\nYes. Last year, the Kansas City Chiefs cut running back Kareem Hunt after a video emerged of him assaulting a woman in a hotel. He was quickly hired by the Cleveland Browns, and is currently serving an eight-game suspension.\n\nThe Patriots released Mr. Brown after he sent intimidating text messages Wednesday to another woman, who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances, Sports Illustrated reported.
