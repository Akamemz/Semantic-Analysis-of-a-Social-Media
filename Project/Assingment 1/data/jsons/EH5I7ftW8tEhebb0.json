    "content": "Fox News Channel should not be struggling right now . It has just completed its 17th year as the most-watched cable news channel , and its third year as the most-watched channel in all of cable TV . It prints money for its owners , the Murdoch family , as part of a cable division that earns more than $ 1.5bn every quarter . And as the Chinese and North Koreans like to say , it \u2019 s as close to the White House as lips and teeth .\nThere \u2019 s also no doubt that it is lurching from one self-inflicted crisis to another , as its anchors and management melt down in full public view .\nHaving barely emerged from multiple sexual harassment scandals , it now has two anchors \u2013 Tucker Carlson and Jeanine Pirro \u2013 exploring the farthest reaches of repulsive commentary that could possibly offend every constituent group of humanity .\nTucker Carlson : Fox host under fire again over resurfaced racist comments Read more\nOn top of all that , the supposed news channel killed the news story about a porn star payoff that could have destroyed its favorite candidate in 2016 , fed that same candidate debate questions , and then served as the official megaphone for one Donald Trump .\nIn Trump \u2019 s Washington , nobody seemed to be shocked that Fox was still paying millions of dollars to a former senior executive who had moved into the White House as communications director . The only shock was when Bill Shine got pushed out of that job , or quit , last week .\nThis is a challenge for an organization that has \u201c News \u201d in its title . For many years , the talented and respectable journalists at Fox have protested that they have nothing to do with the opinion side of their primetime programming . Many other journalists have accepted this and given a pass to people like Bret Baier , Shep Smith and Chris Wallace .\nBut cable news is not like a newspaper , where there are clear divisions between the newsroom and the editorial board of opinion . Each show may have its own team , and may think they have their own identity . But the culture and staff \u2013 and of course the audience \u2013 are spread across them . There is no escaping the reputational damage at Fox News , whether you are writing for its websites , working on dayside or in primetime .\nBefore we go further , a disclaimer or two : this columnist worked for many years as a talking head and executive at Fox \u2019 s arch rival , MSNBC . While employed there , over many hours of live television , I said some stupid things and offended some prominent people . I am sorry for that . Really , I am .\nI was also accused of being so close to the Obama White House that Rush Limbaugh indulged in some of his favorite homophobic insults . The same day Limbaugh teed off on me , someone stuffed a dead rat through my mailbox at home . Charming .\nFor the best part of a year , I got crank calls from an elderly New York lady with dementia , who accused me of all sorts of sex crimes . There \u2019 s a reason why former secret service agents end up working in security at news divisions .\nOh , and Glenn Greenwald said I was the secret tool of corporate lobbyists and propagandizing the American people . Which is just another day at the office for Glenn .\nI also became alarmingly familiar with the inner workings of cable news : the barely controlled chaos , the unpredictable talent , the unaccountable bosses , the downtrodden producers , the desperate politicians , and the passionate fans . It \u2019 s a freak show that will drive you crazy if you aren \u2019 t already . It \u2019 s crack cocaine for the people who call themselves news junkies , including the man who purports to be president but spends all day transfixed by the boob tube .\nIn that world , Fox is the El Chapo of cable news . There were drug cartels before El Chapo rose to the top of the sewer , but nobody was as ruthless and rich and powerful . Until one day , when he thought he was untouchable , and a combination of his ego and his IT guy led to his downfall .\nWhich is a long way of saying : it is all too easy to say and do crazy stuff on air when you \u2019 re living in Crazytown . You have no idea how crazy you are , or how close you are to the edge of the cliff .\nThe problem is that Carlson and Pirro didn \u2019 t err by chance . Their grotesquely offensive comments weren \u2019 t some freakish mistake .
