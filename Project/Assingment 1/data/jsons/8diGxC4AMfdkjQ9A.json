Through Monday , either absentee or in-person early voting had begun in 43 states of the 50 states .\nThe outcome in battleground states -- those that do not reliably vote Republican or Democratic -- are critically important in the U.S. system where president is chosen not by a nationwide popular vote but in state-by-state contests .\nBoth campaigns were working feverishly in the nine most competitive states -- Colorado , Florida , Iowa , Nevada , New Hampshire , North Carolina , Ohio , Virginia and Wisconsin -- to get their core supporters to vote early and persuade undecided voters to back their candidate . The Obama camp was releasing a new television ad in four of those states Monday focusing on the economy , the chief issue among voters in this year 's election .
