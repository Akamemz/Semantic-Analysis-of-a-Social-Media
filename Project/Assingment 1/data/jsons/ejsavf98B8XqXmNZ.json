    "content": "A Georgia high school expelled two students for making a racist video on the social media site TikTok .\n`` They are no longer students at Carrollton High School , '' said District Superintendent Mark Albertus in a statement .\nThe video is highly offensive , and the two students responsible for it\u2014a teenage boy and girl\u2014exercised exceedingly poor judgment . But in punishing them so severely for conduct that took place entirely outside of school , Carrollton education officials have exercised poor judgment as well .\nIn the video , the two students place a piece of paper that reads `` niggers '' in the bathroom sink and proceed to fill it with cups of water representing `` do n't have a dad , '' `` rob people , '' and other racist tropes . The pair made no effort to hide their identities , and their names are publicly associated with the video , which quickly went viral . TikTok eventually deleted it .\nAccording to Insider , the girl offered an extremely weak apology `` to any blacks that got offended , '' placed the blame on her boyfriend , and asked her critics to stop trying to get her `` cancelled . '' No doubt , the video will be associated with their names for a long time , severely harming their college and job prospects , perhaps deservedly .\nIn any case , the school 's handling of the incident is troubling . Indeed , school officials probably violated the First Amendment , though court decisions have limited the free speech rights of K-12 students so egregiously that the matter is not completely clear .\nKeep in mind that the video was filmed at a home\u2014not on school property or during school hours . It did n't name or threaten any specific individuals associated with the school . And it did not advocate or involve illegal behavior . Racists statements , loathsome though they are , qualify as protected speech in most cases .\nThese are all important considerations , because courts have generally limited students ' free speech rights only when necessary to prevent substantial interference with a school 's educational functioning . The landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision in Tinker v. Des Moines held that action taken by schools to punish speech must be `` caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint . ''\nSubsequent rulings have been less favorable to K-12 students ' free speech rights . In the well-known `` bong hits for Jesus '' case , Frederick v.

A more recent decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , Bell v. Itawamba County Board ( 2012 ) , sided against a student whose offensive speech was directed at a school employee .\nIn a statement , Carrollton officials acknowledged that the racist speech took place outside of school but nevertheless asserted that they had the authority to punish the students for it .\nCHS Principal David Brooks , who began investigating the incident Thursday night after the release of the video , said even if the offending incident was recorded after-school hours , it does n't alleviate the students ' responsibility to uphold a high standard of behavior . `` It is our priority to keep our schools safe , and there is no doubt this incident has caused significant tension at Carrollton High School , across the district , state and nation \u2013 even the world , '' he said .\nIt seems like a stretch to argue that the racist video was a safety matter\u2014again , it did not threaten violence or name a specific individual .
