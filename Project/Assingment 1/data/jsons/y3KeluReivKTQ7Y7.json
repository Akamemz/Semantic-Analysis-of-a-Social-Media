    "content": "In his statement to The Atlantic magazine , former Defense Secretary General James Mattis says of the events of the last 10 days that have shaken the nation as it has not been shaken since 1968 : `` We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers . ''\nIs `` a small number of lawbreakers '' an apt description of wilding mobs who have showered cops with bottles , bricks and rocks in 40 cities , looted stores in the hundreds , torched police cars , and injured dozens of Secret Service personnel defending the White House ?\nIs `` a small number of lawbreakers '' the way a patriot would describe anti-American anarchists who desecrated the Lincoln Memorial , the World War II Memorial on the Mall and the Korean War Memorial and tried to burn down the Church of the Presidents in Lafayette Square ?\nWas the sacking of Georgetown , Rodeo Drive in LA , 5th Avenue in New York and 40 city centers , the work of a few `` lawbreakers '' ?\nIs that a good description of the people who gravely wounded that cop in Las Vegas and shot four cops and murdered that retired black police chief in St. Louis ?\nThe protesters , says Mattis , are `` rightly demanding . . . Equal Justice Under Law . '' This is a `` wholesome and unifying demand \u2014 one that all of us should be able to get behind . ''\nBut what does the general think of the methods and means the `` protesters '' have used \u2014 the massive civil disobedience , the blocking of streets , the vilification of police , the contempt for curfews . What does the general think of protesters who provide moral cover for insurrection ?\n`` Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people , '' says Mattis . Trump `` does n't even pretend to try . Instead he tries to divide us . ''\nBut it was not Trump who divided America in this racial crisis .\nThe nation was united in revulsion at the criminal cruelty that led to George Floyd 's death .\nThe nation was united in backing an enraged people 's right to protest that atrocity .\nWhat divided America were the methods and means protesters began using in the first hours of the Minneapolis riot \u2014 the attacks on cops with bottles , bricks and Molotov cocktails .\nIn Mattis ' statement , one finds not a word of sympathy or support for the police bearing the brunt of mob brutality for defending the communities they serve , while defending the constitutional right of the protesters to curse them as racist and rogue cops .\n`` Keeping public order rests with civilian state and local leaders who best understand their communities and are answerable to them , '' not to the military , says the general .\nBut what happens when mobs run wild to where a governor of New York is denouncing the NYPD for failing to protect the city from anarchy and is threatening to replace the mayor for failing to put down the insurrection .\nIn July 1967 , the 82nd Airborne was sent into Detroit to put down the riot .\nIn 1968 , there were federal troops in D.C. to stop the rioting in the wake of Dr. King 's assassination . In the violent protests of the Nixon era , U.S. airborne troops were brought into the basement of the Executive Office Building .\nThe general quotes James Madison : `` America united with a handful of troops , or without a single soldier exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign invaders than an America disunited . ''\nAnd how , General , did that work out for Madison when the `` foreign invaders '' arrived in Maryland in August 1814 , marched up Bladensburg Road , and burned the Capitol and White House and Alexandria , while `` Little Jimmy '' fled out the Brookville Road ?\nIf memory serves , it was Gen.
