'' \u2014 and walked away from her long-awaited trial before the GOP-steered Benghazi committee with her eardrums battered and her candidacy mostly unscathed .\nYet \u2014 24 hours after Joe Biden handed her an election year gift \u2014 Republicans made it clear they intend to keep hammering her , over and over , on Benghazi and her dubious decision to build her \u201c homebrew \u201d email server .\n1 . Clinton won the news cycle \u2014 not the war\nSeldom in the annals of congressional grilling has the power dynamic between accused and accuser been so inverted : Congressional Republicans ( in a protective crouch over House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2019 s apparent admission the committee existed to drive Clinton \u2019 s poll numbers down ) did little to change widespread perceptions they were more interested in damaging the Democratic front-runner than discerning new facts on Benghazi . Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy , who has described the lead-up to the hearing as a spiritual trial , felt the need to kick off the hearing by declaring he wasn \u2019 t on a political hunting expedition . \u201c This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil , \u201d he said \u2014 but soon after firebrands like Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo began barking accusatory questions .\nBy the late afternoon , Clinton looked annoyed and exhausted \u2014 the good kind of annoyed and exhausted . She parried almost every attack with the same kind of dispassionate confidence exhibited on the debate stage a week ago . Republicans threw a lot of wild , roundhouse punches ( Jordan , in particular , harangued her over her insistence that the attack was motivated , in part , by an anti-Islamic video ) . In the hearing \u2019 s signature outburst , Gowdy bellowed , \u201c If you think we \u2019 ve heard about Sidney Blumenthal , wait for the next round , \u201d at a committee Democrat who complained how many questions were being aimed at the secretive , sometime Clinton adviser .\nClinton \u2014 who famously fumed last time she testified on Benghazi \u2014 didn \u2019 t lose her cool this time . But she didn \u2019 t look happy either , passing much of the marathon session with an impatient hand on puckered chin , as Republicans droned on like a traffic court judge with a pending dinner reservation . Anti-Clinton conservatives outside the room fumed at how upstanding Clinton looked in comparison to her inquisitors . \u201c Why does n't Pompeo just go over and swear her in for president now\u2014if he goes on like this , he 'll practically get her elected , \u201d tweeted John Podhoretz , editor of Commentary magazine .\nBut Clinton and her backers run a serious risk if they mistake surviving an ambush for winning : The FBI is still probing Clinton \u2019 s use of a private email server while at the State Department , and some revelations could contradict Clinton \u2019 s statements today \u2014 and that would turn what appeared to be a victory into a delayed-fuse defeat .\n2 . Eleven hours of selfies with a Democrat Republicans love to hate\nNone of the GOP committee members are personally opposing Clinton for the presidency next year , but picking a fight with the Democratic front-runner was an electoral no-brainer .\nEvery single one of them will be running for reelection in 2016 \u2014 mostly in gerrymandered districts where the biggest threat posed to their political survival comes from the right ( Alabama Rep. Martha Roby , especially ) . So battering the party \u2019 s prime target on video \u2014 in the loudest , most confrontational way possible \u2014 makes perfect political sense . Sure it was grating , annoying and confusing to almost everyone else , but a 45-second YouTube clip of your candidate bellowing in the face of the most hated figure in the Democratic Party is pure partisan gold , perfect for TV ads or campaign websites .\nTake Pompeo , who peppered Clinton repeatedly \u2014 but almost always with a reference to the folks back in his Kansas district , where he \u2019 s famously friendly with a few high-profile locals \u2014 like the anti-Clinton Koch brothers .\n\u201c Why didn \u2019 t you fire someone ? \u201d he asked Clinton . \u201c In Kansas , I get asked constantly why has no one been held accountable .

Jim Jordan , the most aggressive of the lot , took the lead , followed by Georgia Rep. Lynn Westmoreland and , eventually , Gowdy .\nGowdy may have scored the most perplexing answer from Clinton when she asserted , late into the evening , that her aides were told by the State Department that nearly all her work-related emails were captured in agency 's databases . \u201c I believed the vast majority of the emails were in their system \u2026 90 [ percent ] to 95 percent were already there , \u201d she said . However , as Gowdy noted , the State Department has acknowledged that its recordkeeping practices were lax and that emails were not automatically archived during Clinton \u2019 s tenure .\nBut for the most part , Gowdy and Co. were almost entirely intent on keeping their sights on Benghazi and Clinton \u2019 s tenure at the State Department , spending most of the day avoiding procedural examinations of Clinton \u2019 s email except to establish that Stevens , the ambassador , did not have her personal email address . ( He had plenty of better ways to get in touch with her team , Clinton insisted .

No email bombshells\n\nFacing pressure to prove the committee was about Benghazi not Clinton 2016, Republican questioners waited until 7:40 p.m. (well after FOX broke away from the hearings) to savage her server arrangement. Jim Jordan, the most aggressive of the lot, took the lead, followed by Georgia Rep.

All Sid, all the time\n\nNo one\u2019s name ID rose more on Thursday than that of Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 Clinton\u2019s on-again-off-again friend/source/staff/chronicler \u2014 and the committee\u2019s Republicans made clear that his name would come up again and again (and again) over the next 15 months.\n\nBlumenthal\u2019s own closed-door June testimony before the panel was the source of the day\u2019s biggest blow-up \u2014 a Gowdy vs. Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings shouting match \u2014 and at times, it felt like his name was mentioned more than Clinton\u2019s.

No fun allowed\n\nOn Thursday evening, Roby pressed Clinton on a question that has nagged at the GOP for months: Where Clinton was, and who she was with, on Sept. 11, 2012, the night of the Benghazi attack.\n\n\u201cWere you alone?,\u201d Roby asked.\n\n\u201cI was alone, yes,\u201d Clinton replied.\n\n\u201cThe whole night?\"\n\n\u201cWell, yes, the whole night,\u201d a bleary-eyed Clinton laughed heartily, as many of the Democrats in the room joined in, more out of fatigue than anything else.\n\nRoby, a 39-year-old former Montgomery council member, grimly reprimanded the world\u2019s most famous woman. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that\u2019s funny,\u201d the congresswoman said as Clinton\u2019s team chuckled. \"Did you have any in-person briefings? I don\u2019t find it funny at all.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Clinton, over nine hours after the hearing began. \u201cA little note of levity at 7:15.\u201d\n\nPost-hearing bonus: 11 hours of Clinton testimony, and all Gowdy got was ... ??\n\nSpeaking to reporters directly after the marathon testimony session ended, Gowdy stumbled when asked what new things he learned, playing directly into Democrats\u2019 oft-repeated talking point that Clinton\u2019s appearance wouldn\u2019t add much to the record.\n\n\"Uh, I think some of Jimmy Jordan\u2019s questioning. Well, when you say new today, we knew some of that already, about the emails. In terms of her testimony?\u201d he asked, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous times she\u2019s testified.\"",
