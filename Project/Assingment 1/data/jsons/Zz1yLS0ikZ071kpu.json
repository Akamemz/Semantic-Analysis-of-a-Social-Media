    "content": "During a Monday interview on the campaign trail , Wendy Davis did something that a lot of politicians do when talking about abortion with national audiences . While explaining her position on reproductive rights , she suggested that a so-called world without abortion is something everyone wants .\n`` The goal that we should have is that we see zero abortions , '' she said . `` But in order to achieve that goal we have to make sure that women are receiving the kind of healthcare and planning that they deserve . ''\nDavis did this for the same reasons Bill Clinton said abortion `` should not only be safe and legal , it should be rare , '' back in 1996 , and for the same reasons so many other advocates and lawmakers use the exact same line . Because they believe it 's a moderate position that will save them from being cast as `` extreme '' when it comes to abortion rights , which they see as a kind of political death .\nBut ultimately , it 's a position that denies reality . And Davis -- who is right about so much else -- is wrong about the objectives of the reproductive rights movement . There simply is no such thing as a world without abortion , nor should we claim to wish for one . Women will always need abortion care . What they do n't need is more stigma .\n`` The thing that makes me absolutely nuts is when people say abortion is never necessary to save a woman 's life , '' Dr. Anne Davis , M.D. , MPH , a second-trimester abortion provider , associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center and consulting medical director at Physicians for Reproductive Health , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` To say abortion does not save women 's lives is false , plain and simple . And to base policy on that kind of lie sacrifices the health of our patients . ''\nAnd to base talking points around this same idea -- that there is a world in which abortion may no longer be necessary , that this is the world we should want to live in -- is just as ridiculous .\nAnd shaming . Because the necessity of abortion care is n't just about the life and health of the woman in the most literal of terms . Women choose abortion in all kinds of circumstances . Politicians who frame it as a necessary evil rather than a medical procedure that saves women 's lives and protects their autonomy erases that simple but important fact .\n`` There will always be a need for abortion , '' Dr. Lin-Fan Wang , M.D. , MPH , a doctor of family medicine , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` I absolutely support removing cost and other barriers to getting contraception , but even if we can do that , women will still face challenges getting it and other care they need . Women have issues finding a provider they trust . There are providers who have misconceptions about who can take birth control and what kind . There is reproductive coercion -- circumstances in relationships , some involving domestic violence -- that make that access an impossibility . ''\nAnd , of course , birth control is n't 100 percent effective . There will always be broken condoms , missed pills . There is no guarantee against human error or plain bad luck .\nCircumstances also change , and even wanted pregnancies can become unwanted pregnancies . Wang recently had a patient who , though she had planned for and wanted the pregnancy , could no longer afford another child after her husband lost his job . This is an increasingly common reality faced by many families who are only one paycheck away from financial calamity .\nNo two women will ever have the same abortion experience . Culturally , we seem to be getting ever so slightly better at understanding that . But we need to make sure that our policies -- and the ways we advocate for those policies -- reflect this understanding by focusing on women themselves , not the number of abortions performed each year .\nThere is a way to have nuanced conversations about the complexity of people 's personal views about abortion without suggesting it 's a problem to be solved or a social ill to be eradicated . It 's a medical procedure , an incredibly safe and common one . Calling `` zero abortions '' a goal is -- besides being completely false -- line for line , what antiabortion lawmakers like Rick Perry say when advocating for policies that deny women basic medical care .\n`` Those of us who are doctors and policymakers should have procedures and laws in place that understand each woman 's situation is unique . We have to ensure that women are empowered to make the best medical decision for them , based on their circumstances , '' Wang noted , reflecting on her own patients . `` I know from personal experience that women are extremely thoughtful about these decisions . We should be focused on their health and the best ways to support them . ''\nIf we 're doing that -- as I 'm sure Wendy Davis would agree -- then who cares about the numbers ?",
