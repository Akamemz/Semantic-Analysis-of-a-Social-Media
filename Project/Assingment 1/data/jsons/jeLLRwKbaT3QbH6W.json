His opposition has helped him get a nine-point polling advantage in the state . But Trump \u2019 s support for major reforms to the H-1B program to reduce the outsourcing of professional jobs is raising his support among upper-income professional-class voters in many other states .\nThe Caterpillar outsourcing \u201c is all the same thing happening over and over again , \u2019 said John Miano , a lawyer and software expert who has sued the federal government to reduce or stop various outsourcing programs , such as the H-1B visa . \u201c What we see is that companies ask for more [ H-1B visas ] while they \u2019 re laying off the same kind of [ American professionals ] \u2026 this is going to be an election that decides whether this continues , \u201d Miano said .\nEarly in 2016 , Caterpillar asked the federal government for 71 H-1B visas needed to hire foreign white-collar college-grads . At least 30 of the requested H-1B visas are for engineers and other skilled professionals in Mossville , which is suffering the most layoffs .\nAt least 44 of the visas requested in 2016 are for foreign graduates who are already working at Caterpillar in the United States . These \u201c continuation \u201d visas are automatically approved , and do not count against the much touted annual limits on H1-B visas .\nAnother 22 of Caterpillar \u2019 s H-1B request visas are for new hires .\nSince 2012 , Caterpillar has requested 768 visas for H-1B workers . Roughly speaking , companies get one-fifth of the new-hire H-1B visas they request , suggesting the company has outsourced at least 100 U.S.-based jobs to lower-wage foreign graduates .\nCompanies are not required to interview Americans , or even announce job openings , before asking for H-1B visas .\nThe H-1B visa allows the foreign college-graduates to stay for at least three years , and some manage to stay permanently . For example , the company has also helped get green cards \u2014 the precursor to citizenship \u2014 for roughly 70 foreign college graduates . Most of these green card employees have replaced Americans software graduates .\nWhile Trump has promised to reform the controversial H-1B program as part of his plan to ensure that immigration law helps Americans before companies or foreign workers , Hillary Clinton has been a strong supporter of the H-1B program , and her foundation has tried to hire more than 130 foreign professionals in place of young Americans .\nThat political difference over white-collar outsourcing may become critical in the new few weeks when Trump tries to raise his support among college graduates .\nTrump is already doing well among blue-collar families , party because of his promise to start enforcing existing laws that bar the hiring of illegals . But Trump is doing poorly among college-graduates , partly because few white-collar workers yet recognize the pocketbook impact to them of federal immigration practices . Fewer still know that states are also allowing illegal immigrants to work in professional jobs .\nAmerican professionals prefer to ignore the threat from the government \u2019 s H-1B program , said Miano . \u201c They all all think \u2018 I \u2019 m good\u2026 if I keep up my skills , I don \u2019 t have anything to worry about \u2019 \u2014 but they don \u2019 t know these [ hiring ] decisions are being made by accountants who have no idea what their skills are , \u201d he said .\nThat outsourcing process is a huge threat to the middle class because it is \u201c cutting off the ability of people to rise up , \u201d he said . \u201c The whole thing of the middle class is to send your kids to college , get professional jobs and move up \u2014 but now that is being destroyed \u201d by outsourcing , Miano said .\nMany companies outsource U.S. white collar jobs to foreign professionals \u2014 Disney , DeLoitte , many hospitals , Facebook , Intel , Qualcomm , Microsoft , plus many smaller companies , such as the Toys R Us retailer , Cengage publishing firm , and New York Life insurance company . The scale and details of the outsourcing movement can be tracked at websites , including MyVisaJobs.com .\nVirgil Bierschwale , a displaced software expert , has posted details of the H-1B program and maps showing the locations and employer contacts for H-1B requests .\nMuch of the 2016 H-1B outsourcing at Caterpillar is for engineering jobs held by Americans .\nCommercial job search boards show many Americans are qualified for those jobs . Indeed.com , for example , offers the resumes of 2,445 engineers within a 25-mile distance of Mossville , including some recently posted resumes of Caterpillar \u2019 s soon-to-be-outsourced employees .\nThese engineering jobs are in the so-called STEM field , which the federal government \u2014 and the private sector \u2014 has long declared will provide a secure upward path for American college grads .\nHowever , even as young Americans study to earn places in colleges , the federal government is helping companies employ a population of roughly 650,000 H-1B professionals in the United States .\nThe resident population of around 650,000 H-1B professionals include roughly 100,000 professionals at U.S. universities . The outsourced university jobs include tens of thousands of jobs for professors and lecturers , doctors and therapists , scientists and researchers .\nMost of the 650,000 outsourced H-1B jobs are in the information technology sector , where the imported professionals have lowered wages throughout the industry and forced middle-aged Americans into new , lower-paying careers \u2014 such as journalism \u2014 at just the time when they need good pay to help their children get a good education .\nMany additional outsourced H-1B jobs are in business and finance , architecture and design , p.r . and media , health care , and teaching .\nThe wide variety of jobs shows how the H-1B outsourcing is reaching far beyond Silicon Valley . For example , companies such as CVS are increasingly using foreign college graduates to replace American pharmacists in Washington D.C. , New York , and across the nation .\n\u201c If American professionals don \u2019 t stand up soon , they \u2019 ll be going the way of the auto workers and the factory workers in just a few years , \u201d said Miano .",
