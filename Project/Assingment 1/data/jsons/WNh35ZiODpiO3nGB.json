    "content": "Back in June , a tantalizing set of reports from Shane Harris of the Wall Street Journal gave us one indication that collusion may have occurred , or was at least attempted , between supporters of Donald Trump \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign and Russian hackers who targeted Democrats \u2019 emails .\nAnd the reports raised serious questions about whether fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was involved in these efforts to contact hackers \u2014 questions that , per a new report by Harris published this Friday , special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into .\nAt issue is an effort by Peter Smith , a Trump-supporting GOP operative and private equity executive , to track down Hillary Clinton \u2019 s infamous 30,000 or so deleted emails during the fall of 2016 .\nThe effort , described on the record to Harris by Smith ( the 81-year-old man died a week and a half after their interview ) , entailed outreach to several hacker groups , including at least two that Smith believed to be Russian-tied , to see if they had hacked the emails and could release them .\nThe emails \u2014 which Clinton said she deleted because they were personal and unrelated to her work as secretary of state \u2014 never surfaced . And Smith didn \u2019 t work for the Trump campaign .\nBut there is a potential connection to the campaign \u2014 through Flynn . Smith repeatedly claimed that he was in contact with Flynn about the effort to find Clinton \u2019 s emails , per Harris \u2019 s sources :\n\u201c He said , \u2018 I \u2019 m talking to Michael Flynn about this \u2014 if you find anything , can you let me know ? \u2019 \u201d said Eric York , a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith \u2019 s behalf for people who might have access to the emails . ... ... In phone conversations , Mr. Smith told a computer expert he was in direct contact with Mr. Flynn and his son , according to this expert . ... The expert said that based on his conversations with Mr. Smith , he understood the elder Mr. Flynn to be coordinating with Mr. Smith \u2019 s group in his capacity as a Trump campaign adviser .\nHarris also described , apparently for the first time , US intelligence reports claiming Russian hackers discussed how to get hacked emails to Flynn through a third party .\nInvestigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary , according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence .\nAll this clearly raises serious questions about just what Flynn knew about this or any other attempted outreach to Russian hackers .\nFurther details on Smith \u2019 s effort were revealed in a June article on Lawfare published by information security expert Matt Tait and called \u201c The Time I Got Recruited to Collude with the Russians . \u201d\nIn the article , Tait described briefly working with Smith in his effort to obtain Clinton \u2019 s deleted emails . He wrote that his impression was that \u201c it was immediately apparent that Smith was both well connected within the top echelons of the campaign and he seemed to know both Lt. Gen. Flynn and his son well. \u201d He continues :\nThe combination of Smith \u2019 s deep knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign , this document naming him in the \u201c Trump campaign \u201d group , and the multiple references to needing to avoid campaign reporting suggested to me that the group was formed with the blessing of the Trump campaign .\nHowever , Tait \u2014 an information security expert who tweets under the handle \u201c Pwnallthethings \u201d \u2014 acknowledged that he has no further proof of this .\nHow this story fits into the timeline of the hackings\nIt \u2019 s no secret that Trump wanted someone to find Clinton \u2019 s deleted emails \u2014 he said as much publicly .\nTo recap : When word got out that Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department , she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators . But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails ( about half of the total ) to be \u201c personal \u201d rather than work-related , and deleted them .\nMany conservatives didn \u2019 t take Clinton \u2019 s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value , and questioned whether the deleted emails could have included some incriminating information that might reveal scandalous behavior of some kind . One of those Republicans was Trump , who repeatedly referenced the deleted emails on the campaign trail .\nIn July 2016 , hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee were publicly released , and the hacks were thought to be the work of Russia . And at the time , Trump said in public that he hoped there would be email releases to come \u2014 including Clinton \u2019 s deleted ones .\n\u201c Russia , if you \u2019 re listening , I hope you \u2019 re able to find the 30,000 [ Hillary Clinton ] emails that are missing , \u201d he said at a press conference . \u201c I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press . Let 's see if that happens . That will be next . \u201d\nA few months after this , in fall 2016 , Peter Smith launched the effort reported by the Journal to try to get the emails from hacking groups that he thought might have them \u2014 including hacking groups he understood to be tied to the Russian government .\nAgain , though , it seems that no one did have Clinton \u2019 s deleted emails . The biggest Russia-linked email hacks and dumps involved the DNC accounts ( released in July 2016 ) and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta \u2019 s emails ( released in October 2016 ) , but no emails from Clinton \u2019 s own server .\nStill , one major question has always been whether any Trump associates were involved in these or other hacking efforts .\nThere \u2019 s been a whole lot of evidence that several Trump associates ( including Flynn ) had ties to Russian officials , and of course it was clear that Trump \u2019 s public policies were far more pro-Russia than the Republican norm .\nBut there really hasn \u2019 t been very much evidence tying anyone in Trumpworld to any hacking \u2014 making it plausible that the hacking operations were carried out without any coordination or contacts with anyone in Trump \u2019 s camp .\nHarris \u2019 s reports have changed that somewhat , telling us about Smith \u2019 s outreach to Russian hackers \u2014 and , more importantly , Smith \u2019 s claims that Flynn ( who was close to Trump ) may have known too . And there \u2019 s that other claim that US intelligence suggests Russian hackers were discussing giving hacked emails to Flynn . Where would they get that idea ?\nAny involvement from Flynn could be quite significant . He \u2019 s known to have had many contacts with Russian officials , and he advised Trump on foreign policy matters during the presidential campaign .\nAfterward , Trump named him national security adviser . But he didn \u2019 t last long in the post , resigning in February due to controversy over whether he falsely described his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition .\nBy then , the White House had been told that Flynn was under federal investigation . And then-FBI Director James Comey has since testified that the day after Flynn \u2019 s firing , President Trump took him aside and told him , \u201c I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . \u201d\nSo Trump has already been trying to shield Flynn from investigators \u2014 making the question of just what Flynn might know ever more interesting , and one that special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s mind appears to be trying to get to the bottom of .",
