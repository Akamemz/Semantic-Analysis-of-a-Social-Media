It is its strongest now , '' Trump said from a platform in front of the famous memorial , echoing a theme he uses at campaign rallies .\nFlanked by Bradley fighting vehicles , Trump otherwise steered clear of divisive political rhetoric , in a departure from the majority of his speeches . At times , an enthusiastic crowd could be heard chanting : `` USA ! USA ! USA ! ''\nTrump , 73 , praised American military might despite having himself avoided the draft during the Vietnam War with bone spurs in his feet . With well-planned choreography , he told stories about each military branch before separate , dramatic flyovers of their respective military aircraft .\n`` We celebrate our history , our people , and the heroes who proudly defend our flag : the brave men and women of the United States military , '' Trump said . `` For over 65 years , no enemy Air Force has managed to kill a single American soldier .
