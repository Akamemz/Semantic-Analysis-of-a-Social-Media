But they are still , on average , less expensive than what the government had originally forecast . About 20 million Americans now have health insurance who did not have it before . And projections for the total cost of healthcare in America have fallen \u2013 by $ 2.6 trillion \u2013 compared to the government forecast in 2010 , when the law was signed .\nAt the same time , Aetna \u2019 s move highlights an aspect of the new system that \u2019 s problematic in some parts of the country , particularly rural areas : the \u201c exchange \u201d markets where people choose their insurer under Obamacare . The problem is that key insurers are losing hundreds of millions of dollars in these exchanges and pulling out of some of them , leaving consumers with only one insurer \u2013 i.e. , no choice .\nMr. Sloan \u2019 s firm , Avalere Health , on Friday released a troubling forecast : A third of the country \u2019 s exchange regions may offer only one insurer in 2017 . That analysis reflects publicly announced pullbacks from exchanges by insurer giants Aetna , Humana , and UnitedHealthcare and by some co-ops for 2017 . The marketplace exchanges , which cover about 11 million people in total , enable people to get subsidized healthcare .\nThe consulting firm lists seven states \u2013 Alaska , Alabama , Kansas , North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , and Wyoming \u2013 where Obamacare consumers can expect to be offered only one insurer in each market-exchange region in the state . The analysis does not account for insurers that may still be planning to enter these markets , which is a distinct possibility .\nOthers argue that pullouts by insurer heavyweights from some of the exchange markets do not necessarily spell doomsday . Some of these markets are serviced by smaller insurers \u2013 and the big companies simply couldn \u2019 t compete .\n\u201c When some insurers are coming in with narrower networks , at a lower price , that \u2019 s what you want , \u201d says Linda Blumberg , an expert on the exchanges at the Urban Institute .

That \u2019 s not even a remote possibility before the election , though it may be possible afterward , depending on the outcome , analysts say .\nHere are some of the commonly suggested \u201c fixes \u201d to the exchanges :\nExpand the pool of healthy enrollees . A big problem is that there aren \u2019 t enough young , healthy enrollees in some of the exchange markets to balance out the costs of older participants whose care is more expensive .\nMore of an outreach effort could be made to attract these healthier people , Blumberg notes , but others say that 's not enough .\nThe penalty for not having insurance \u2013 determined at annual tax filing time \u2013 is neither immediate enough nor severe enough to get enough younger folks to enroll . Rather than pour on more vinegar , try a sweetener : Offer plans that young people perceive as desirable and affordable , says Joseph Antos , at the American Enterprise Institute .\nThat would mean changing the government requirements for the plans , he says .\n\u201c The solution is to change the rules so insurers can change products that people might be willing to buy at a price people might be willing to pay , \u201d he says .\nIncrease federal financial support in troubled markets . It \u2019 s not just that rural areas , where the problem is most prevalent , have an imbalance between older , sicker people and younger , healthier ones . It can be more expensive to offer healthcare in remote regions \u2013 and sometimes there \u2019 s just one provider , one hospital , that doesn \u2019 t want price competition from multiple insurers .\nThat argues for the government stepping in with its own subsidized plan \u2013 the so-called \u201c public option \u201d \u2013 say Democrats , from President Obama to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton .
