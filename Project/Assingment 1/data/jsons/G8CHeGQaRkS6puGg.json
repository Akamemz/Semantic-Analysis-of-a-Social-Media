It praised the nonpartisan agency \u2019 s finding that low-wage workers \u2019 income would rise but said the CBO job numbers \u201c do not reflect the overall consensus view of economists . \u201d\nRepublicans predicted that the CBO report will bolster opposition on Capitol Hill , where the issue is likely to come up for votes in the next few weeks .\n\u201c Raising the minimum wage would slash jobs and harm an already fragile workforce , \u201d said Sen. John Cornyn , Texas Republican . \u201c Whether it \u2019 s Obamacare , a minimum wage hike , or a trillion-dollar stimulus bill charged to the nation \u2019 s credit card , the bottom line is the president \u2019 s big-government experiment kills jobs . \u201d\nThe report marks the second time this month that the CBO has caused headaches for President Obama \u2019 s domestic agenda .
