    "content": "Mitch McConnell rarely goes out on a limb on issues that divide Senate Republicans . He \u2019 s more prone to sit back and listen , let his conference work out their differences \u2014 and only then assert his own views .\nBut the majority leader ditched that dispassionate approach when it came time to renew the country \u2019 s anti-terrorism surveillance laws \u2014 he spoke out early and vociferously against reforming soon-to-expire PATRIOT Act provisions \u2014 and the departure now threatens to undermine the Kentucky Republican \u2019 s vow to bring more responsible governance to the Senate .\nFor weeks , McConnell tried to lay the groundwork for an extension of the post-9/11 law , only to be boxed into a corner by the House GOP leadership and his junior senator from Kentucky , Rand Paul , who \u2019 ve pushed to substantially change or end the program .\nHeaded into a rare Sunday session , McConnell now has a choice : He can capitulate from his position and let a House-passed bill pass over his own objections , seek to amend the House bill or continue to insist on a short-term extension . With no deal , he could witness the collapse of the sweeping surveillance program on his own watch .\nMcConnell \u2019 s chief nemesis said the majority leader should have seen this coming .\n\u201c He defiantly said we \u2019 re going to do all this . [ But ] things happen , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) said in an interview last week about McConnell \u2019 s plans to finish the surveillance law before adjourning for recess . \u201c You just never know ; you can \u2019 t be defiant . \u201d\nThe essence of the dispute is over the National Security Agency \u2019 s mass collection of Americans \u2019 phone records , which McConnell and national security hawks are eager to maintain because they say it \u2019 s central to the nation \u2019 s fight against terrorism . But buoyed by civil libertarian concerns , House Republicans endorsed a White House-supported bill called the USA Freedom Act that would effectively end the bulk data program as it \u2019 s currently constituted .\nWith no deal by 11:59 p.m. Sunday , the bulk data collection program will lapse along with two other key PATRIOT Act authorities : one to surveil suspected \u201c lone wolf \u201d terrorists who aren \u2019 t members of a known terrorist group and another to allow federal authorities to use roving wiretaps to track potential assailants \u2019 patterns . Federal authorities flatly warn there would be severe disruption to surveillance operations if Congress doesn \u2019 t reach a deal Sunday , and the administration has already begun dismantling the program .\nA spokesman for McConnell pointed to his comments last week suggesting that a short-term extension is the only way for the Senate to work out a bill with the House \u201c that does not destroy an important counter-terrorism tool that \u2019 s needed to protect American lives . \u201d\nOn most thorny issues , McConnell sees his job as guiding the Senate to a result . His colleagues will battle out the matter behind closed doors , and he rarely dictates strategy in those private sessions . That often leaves the caucus with little clear direction on the way forward , even as they \u2019 re aware McConnell almost always has an unspoken plan in mind .\nIn this case , though , McConnell has made clear he detests the House \u2019 s USA Freedom Act , which passed that body on a commanding 338-88 vote . He has publicly and privately urged his colleagues to vote against it . Rather than moving the matter through the normal committee process , as he has long vowed to do , McConnell bypassed the Senate Judiciary Committee by attempting to put extensions of the current law \u2014 ranging from two months to more than five years \u2014 on the Senate floor .\nIn a 1,283-word speech Friday , he forcefully called for an extension of the expiring law and criticized the House \u2019 s legislative effort as lacking \u201c at a moment of elevated threats to the American people . \u201d\n\u201c We need to recognize that terrorist tactics and the nature of the threat have changed , and that at a moment of elevated threat it would be a mistake to take from our intelligence community any of the valuable tools needed to build a complete picture of terrorist networks and their plans \u2014 such as the bulk data collection program , \u201d McConnell said , referring to the expiring authorities of the PATRIOT Act . \u201c The intelligence community needs these tools to protect Americans . \u201d\nMcConnell \u2019 s stance was dealt a blow earlier this month when a federal court ruled that Congress never authorized the NSA \u2019 s bulk data program . It only got worse when the issue reached the Senate floor late Friday night and into the wee hours of Saturday .\nThe Republican leader \u2019 s two-month extension failed on a 45-54 vote ; by contrast , the USA Freedom Act received 57 votes , just three shy of surmounting McConnell \u2019 s effort to block it . Paul , along with Sens . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) and Martin Heinrich ( D-N.M. ) , objected to even shorter-term measures , forcing McConnell to return early from the Memorial Day recess for a Senate session that will kick off just eight hours before the PATRIOT Act authorities expire .\nOn Wednesday afternoon , senior Republicans said there \u2019 s no clear way out of the mess even as they were generally hopeful about a resolution by the time lawmakers return to Washington . Privately , though , some of McConnell \u2019 s allies believe the only escape hatch would be to let the USA Freedom Act pass the Senate .\nMcConnell \u2019 s strategy has perplexed some senators trying to find ways to work with him across party lines .

And right now it clearly isn \u2019 t , \u201d Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del . ) , one of a handful of Democrats to meet one-on-one with McConnell this year , said Wednesday . \u201c I genuinely do not understand Majority Leader McConnell \u2019 s strategy and views on this issue .
