And once again , the bull 's eye is the 1965 Voting Rights Act , widely viewed as the most effective and successful civil rights legislation in American history . Upheld five times by the court , the law now appears to be on life support .\nThe provision at issue in Wednesday 's case applies only to specific parts of the country where discriminatory voting procedures were once rampant . It covers all of nine states , mainly in the South , plus parts of seven other states . To head off discriminatory voting procedures before they happen , the law requires covered areas to get approval from federal officials before changes can take place . So , for example , if an Alabama town wants to change polling places , or to change from an elected board to an appointed board , or to annex another part of the county , it has to first get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington , D.C .\nCongress came up with the formula in 1965 to cover areas of the country that had a history of blatant , even violent discrimination in voting ; but the formula has not been changed since 1975 , and it still relies on election data from 1972 . That 's the crux of the issue before the court now : whether times have changed so much that Congress , in reauthorizing the law in 2006 without updating the formula , violated the Constitution .\nThe congressional vote in 2006 was overwhelmingly and astonishingly bipartisan , with the Senate voting unanimously to extend the law and the House voting 390-33 .\n`` What the 12,000 pages of hearing [ testimony ] showed '' is that for many of the jurisdictions , `` there still was pervasive discrimination , '' says Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin , who led weeks of hearings in the House as chairman of the Judiciary Committee .\nUnder the law , any jurisdiction with a clean record for 10 years could bail out , and some have done just that . There is also a provision to bail in jurisdictions that can be shown in court to have consistently misbehaved . But basically the law was unchanged \u2014 all the areas that had been subject to preclearance before 2006 still were \u2014 and Congress simply extended it for another 25 years .\nThat prompted a legal challenge . But when it reached the Supreme Court in 2009 , the justices dodged the major issue in the case , ruling instead on a lesser question . At the same time , though , Chief Justice John Roberts ' opinion for the court expressed serious doubt as to whether the law was justified anymore , and it all but invited a future challenge if Congress did not act to change the coverage formula .\nCongress , of course , did not act , and now the issue is back in a case brought by Shelby County , Ala. , a once rural and now more suburban community south of Birmingham .\nFrank `` Butch '' Ellis has been the Shelby County attorney since 1964 , the year before the Voting Rights Act was enacted .\n`` The South has changed , '' he says , adding that there is no more discrimination in the South than anywhere else . `` There 's probably bits of it everywhere , but there 's no evidence that it 's more prevalent in these covered jurisdictions than it is in the noncovered jurisdictions .

That's the crux of the issue before the court now: whether times have changed so much that Congress, in reauthorizing the law in 2006 without updating the formula, violated the Constitution.\n\nCongressional Action\n\nThe congressional vote in 2006 was overwhelmingly and astonishingly bipartisan, with the Senate voting unanimously to extend the law and the House voting 390-33.\n\n\"What the 12,000 pages of hearing [testimony] showed\" is that for many of the jurisdictions, \"there still was pervasive discrimination,\" says Republican Rep.
