    "content": "Barack Obama has now hit the 100th day of his second term , a milestone which generally means less than it does in the first term , when a new President has a true honeymoon . Obama was the first President in long memory to win a second term with a lower percentage of the vote ( and fewer votes ) than in his first election , a pretty clear sign that Obama didn \u2019 t have a big popular mandate to ride in the first months afterward , too . Even with lower expectations in mind , Obama has done almost nothing to advance an agenda , leaving the impression of a lame-duck executive at least two years too early .\nBrian Hughes , the Washington Examiner \u2019 s White House correspondent , writes that time is running out :\nOne hundred days into his second term , President Obama has not accomplished any part of his ambitious legislative agenda . And the window to turn things around is closing fast . For Obama , the past three months were critical to building momentum for legacy-defining achievements , starting with gun control and comprehensive immigration reform . Like any second-term president , the sprint from Inauguration Day is seen as the most productive time for major new laws . But the president enjoyed no honeymoon at the start of his second term . Even his push for expanded background checks on gun purchases , which the White House trumpets as an issue with the backing of 90 percent of Americans , was too steep a climb on Capitol Hill . Obama has alternated between stretches of blasting Congress and wooing lawmakers , essentially running his own good-cop , bad-cop routine . Neither strategy has worked so far . And some Obama supporters are now expressing concern that the first 100 days of the second term were wasted .\nIt didn \u2019 t help that the White House budget proposal , which was due on about Day 15 , didn \u2019 t appear until Day 80 . Budget proposals frame agendas and priorities in a concrete manner , and until Presidents offer budgets , no one has a clear idea what the White House actually wants to do for the next 18 months . The long delay , on top of all the fighting over the sequester and tax rates , ended up wasting what little momentum Obama had .\nMarc Ambinder writes that Obama \u2019 s shift to the middle has made it more difficult to move an agenda :\nWith detractors on both sides , Obama is , for better or worse , now positioned in the political center on an array of domestic and foreign issues .

He has been moving there for years , most notably starting in his 2011 State of the Union address . The real question isn \u2019 t if Obama is in the middle \u2014 it \u2019 s whether owning the center can translate into actual victories in Congress \u2014 and whether Obama \u2019 s political style is effective in a polarized Congress .\nActually , Obama isn \u2019 t in the \u201c middle \u201d on Keystone or on Social Security and Medicare , either \u2014 he \u2019 s nowhere .

Despite years-long pressure from Congress on Keystone , Obama won \u2019 t take a position on the pipeline that Canada now says will be a critical measure of their relationship with the US . And on gun control , Ambinder seems to forget that Obama went all-in on the assault-weapons ban and the demagoguery against gun owners before backtracking to background checks \u2014 hardly a \u201c middle \u201d position .\nEven his victories turn out to be flops . Obama won tax hikes in January but ended up making the rates and the AMT fix permanent , removing all leverage from the sequester fight when Republicans turned the tables on him .
