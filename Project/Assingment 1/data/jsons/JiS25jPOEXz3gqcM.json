    "content": "In their first meeting following renewed tensions between the U.S. and Russia , President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin called Monday for an end to the violence in Syria and said there \u2019 s still time for diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons .\nAs world leaders gathered for the two-day Group of 20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico , much of the focus was on the European economic crisis , which could deflate Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election hopes . Mr. Obama hailed the victory of pro-bailout parties in Sunday \u2019 s elections in Greece , and held one-on-one talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who has resisted the president \u2019 s call for quick economic stimulus measures .\nEuropean officials downplayed any hopes of a quick solution to the worsening problems in the 17-nation eurozone , and bristled at the suggestion they need help .\n\u201c Frankly , we are not coming here to receive lessons in terms of democracy or in terms of how to run our economy , \u201d said European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso .\nBut Mr. Obama \u2019 s most-anticipated meeting of the day was a two-hour session behind closed doors with Mr. Putin , who snubbed Mr. Obama last month by skipping an international conference at Camp David . The Obama administration last week accused Moscow of contributing to the Syrian government \u2019 s slaying of pro-democracy protesters by selling military helicopters to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .\nMr. Putin and Mr. Obama issued a joint statement Monday agreeing for the need to end the violence in Syria , although Mr. Putin didn \u2019 t elaborate in his remarks to reporters , saying only \u201c we \u2019 ve been able to find many commonalities \u201d on issues including \u201c the Syrian affair . \u201d\nMr. Obama said they pledged to work with the United Nations and other parties to stop the killing of civilians .\n\u201c We agreed that we need to see a cessation of the violence , that a political process has to be created to prevent civil war and the kind of horrific deaths that we \u2019 ve seen over the last several weeks , \u201d Mr. Obama said , while Mr. Putin bit his lip and stared at the floor .\nOn Iran , Mr. Obama said the two leaders \u201c emphasized our shared approach \u201d as members of the ongoing negotiations of the so-called \u201c P5 plus one \u201d group seeking to achieve full international inspections of Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities .\n\u201c We agreed that there \u2019 s still time and space to resolve diplomatically the issue of Iran \u2019 s potential development of nuclear weapons , as well as its interest in developing peaceful nuclear power , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nTheir statement also briefly touched on another source of tensions \u2014 a proposed missile defense shield in Europe . The U.S. and its NATO allies are proceeding with plans for a shield over Russian objections .\nAt a summit in March , Mr. Obama was caught in a \u201c hot mic \u201d moment asking then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for more breathing room on missile shield negotiations until after the U.S. elections in November . Unaware that a reporter was listening , Mr. Obama told the Russian he would have more \u201c flexibility \u201d after his presumed reelection , sparking a storm of criticism at home .\nIn their joint statement Monday , Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin said that \u201c despite differences , \u201d the two nations agreed \u201c to continue a joint search for solutions to challenges in the field of missile defense . \u201d\nThey also urged North Korea \u201c not to commit acts that would escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula , \u201d a reference to the North \u2019 s launch in April of a rocket that disintegrated shortly after liftoff . Analysts said the missile was capable of carrying a nuclear warhead .\nAs the summit got under way Monday , Mexican President Felipe Calderon thanked President Obama in person Monday for his decision to stop deporting young-adult illegal immigrants from the U.S . The Mexican leader praised Mr. Obama \u2019 s \u201c valor and courage \u201d for taking the executive action on immigration Friday .\nMr. Calderon called the move \u201c unprecedented , \u201d and said he \u2019 s sure many families in the U.S. are thanking Mr. Obama as well .\nOn Friday , Mr. Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced they would categorically stop deporting illegal immigrants under age 30 who were brought to the country before age 16 , have been here for at least five years and have completed high school , earned an equivalency diploma or joined the U.S. military .\nThose criteria are similar to the Dream Act legislation that never passed Congress , but that would have granted a path to citizenship to most illegal immigrants under 30 .\nThe move put presumed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney on the defensive . Mr. Romney didn \u2019 t say whether he would revoke the action if elected , but he also said that Mr. Obama \u2019 s move was all about election-year politics .\n\u201c The timing is pretty clear , \u201d Mr. Romney said on the CBS program \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on Sunday . \u201c If he really wanted to make a solution that dealt with these children or with illegal immigration in America , then this is something he would have taken up in his first 3\u00bd years , not in his last few months . \u201d\nOn the eurozone , Mr. Obama lacks the leverage to ease the persistent economic crisis that is threatening his bid for a second term . But he hailed the elections in troubled Greece as a positive step toward global stability .\nThe election Sunday of parties supporting Greece \u2019 s financial-bailout package \u201c indicates a positive prospect \u201d not only for forming a new government in Athens , but also for \u201c working constructively with their international partners , \u201d Mr. Obama told reporters .\nFinance ministers from around the world awaited the outcome as Greeks voted to either accept the terms of their $ 140 billion bailout or default on their debt and quit the 17-nation eurozone . The pro-bailout , New Democracy party took nearly 30 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections , but still needs to form a coalition government .\nMr. Obama said the election means that Greeks \u201c can continue on the path of reform and do so in a way that also offers the prospects for the Greek people to succeed and prosper . \u201d\n\u201c And we are going to be working \u2026 with our European partners , and with all countries , to make sure that we \u2019 re contributing so that the economy grows , the situation stabilizes , confidence returns to the markets and , most importantly we \u2019 re giving our people the chance if they work hard to succeed and do well , \u201d the president said .\nMr. Obama has been urging European leaders to resolve their debt crisis , but he has few tools at his disposal beyond persuasion to help resolve it . The president has been trying to convince German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others to focus more on immediate economic stimulus measures , rather than deficit reduction .\nEurope is America \u2019 s largest trading partner , and the impact of the downturn overseas has affected the sluggish U.S. economy .\nThe eurozone \u2019 s economy is expected to dominate the two-day G-20 summit .\nThe summit will allow the leaders of the participating industrialized nations to take \u201c one important step in a series of steps that are going to be required to continue to improve global economic prospects , \u201d Mr. Obama said .",
