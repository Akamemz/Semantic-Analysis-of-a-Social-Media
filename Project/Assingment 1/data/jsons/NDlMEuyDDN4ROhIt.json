John McCain , Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte sent a letter to President Obama asking why U.S. officials \u201c described the attack for days afterward as a spontaneous response to an anti-Islam video . \u201d\n\u201c These emails make clear that your administration knew within two hours of the attack that it was a terrorist act and that Ansar al-Sharia , a Libyan militant group with links to al Qaeda , had claimed responsibility for it , \u201d the senators \u2019 letter states . \u201c This latest revelation only adds to the confusion surrounding what you and your administration knew about the attacks in Benghazi , when you knew it , and why you responded to those tragic events in the ways that you did . \u201d\nEarlier Wednesday , administration officials said the email , which was first reported by Reuters , was just part of an initial scramble of communications about the assault that killed U.S .
