What will tell you ... will be how you respond to it with containment and mitigation . '\nServing a president who until recently dismissed coronavirus by comparing it to seasonal flu , Fauci has been even-handed in public .\nHe 's won the respect of Democratic and Republican lawmakers , along with Trump administration officials .\nAlmost in matter-of-fact fashion Fauci acknowledged to Congress in recent days that the government system was n't designed for mass testing of potential infections .\n'It is a failing , let \u2019 s admit it , ' he told lawmakers .\nBut he also supported President Donald Trump 's restrictions on travel from Europe . It 's part of the containment strategy , he explained .\n'It was pretty compelling that we needed to turn off the source from that region , ' he said .\nThe threat of a pandemic has been on Fauci 's mind for years . Many scientists thought it would come from the flu , but it turned out to be coronavirus .\nFauci was unflappable answering questions for hours from the House Oversight and Reform committee last week - except if there was any hint of questioning his scientific integrity .\n' I served served six presidents and I have never done anything other than tell the exact scientific evidence and made policy recommendations based on the science and the evidence , ' he said .\n'The scientists I 've spoken with in committee see you as the lead man , and I believe most of America does , ' Rep. Clay Higgins , a Republican from Louisiana , told Fauci .\nDemocratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts praised Fauci for accurately stating that a vaccine would not be available in a matter of months , contrary to what Trump has suggested at times .\n'You have a certain level of credibility and honesty that I think ... should be persuasive to the American people , ' Lynch told him .\n'Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long , long hours , ' the president said Friday at a Rose Garden event .\nFauci became head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984 , when the nation was in the throes of the AIDS crisis .\nHe 's recalled the huge frustration of caring for dying patients in the NIH \u2019 s hospital with nothing to offer .\nAfter hours , he \u2019 d chat with then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop about what scientists were learning about AIDS , influencing Koop \u2019 s famous 1986 report educating Americans about the disease .\nHowever , the midst of professional stress , the workaholic Fauci found solace in his personal life .\nIn 1985 , at the age of 44 , he tied the knot to nurse Christine Grady . The pair went on to have three daughters : Jennifer , Megan and Alison .\nFauci has been married to nurse Christine Grady since 1985\nIn 1990 , when AIDS activists swarmed the NIH to protest what they saw as government indifference , Fauci brought them to the table .\nFast forward , and he helped to shape Trump 's initiative to end HIV in the U.S .\nAlthough he 's spent his career in government , Fauci does n't seem to have lost the human touch \u2014 and that may be part of the key to his success as a communicator .\nDuring the 2014 Ebola outbreak , many Americans panicked when a US nurse got infected by a patient she was caring for , a traveler from West Africa .\nWhen the NIH hospital released that nurse , not only did he say she was n't contagious , he gave her a hug before TV cameras to prove he was not worried .",

Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts praised Fauci for accurately stating that a vaccine would not be available in a matter of months, contrary to what Trump has suggested at times.\n\n'You have a certain level of credibility and honesty that I think ... should be persuasive to the American people,' Lynch told him.\n\nFauci's candor hasn't stopped Trump from praising him.\n\n'Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours,' the president said Friday at a Rose Garden event.\n\nFauci became head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1984, when the nation was in the throes of the AIDS crisis.\n\nHe's recalled the huge frustration of caring for dying patients in the NIH\u2019s hospital with nothing to offer.\n\nAfter hours, he\u2019d chat with then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop about what scientists were learning about AIDS, influencing Koop\u2019s famous 1986 report educating Americans about the disease.\n\nHowever, the midst of professional stress, the workaholic Fauci found solace in his personal life.\n\nIn 1985, at the age of 44, he tied the knot to nurse Christine Grady. The pair went on to have three daughters: Jennifer, Megan and Alison.\n\nFauci has been married to nurse Christine Grady since 1985\n\nIn 1990, when AIDS activists swarmed the NIH to protest what they saw as government indifference, Fauci brought them to the table.\n\nFast forward, and he helped to shape Trump's initiative to end HIV in the U.S.\n\nAlthough he's spent his career in government, Fauci doesn't seem to have lost the human touch \u2014 and that may be part of the key to his success as a communicator.\n\nDuring the 2014 Ebola outbreak, many Americans panicked when a US nurse got infected by a patient she was caring for, a traveler from West Africa.\n\nEbola can cause deadly bleeding.\n\nFauci confronted those fears by setting a personal example.\n\nWhen the NIH hospital released that nurse, not only did he say she wasn't contagious, he gave her a hug before TV cameras to prove he was not worried.",
