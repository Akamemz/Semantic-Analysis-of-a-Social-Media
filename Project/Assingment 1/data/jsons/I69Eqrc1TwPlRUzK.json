    "content": "At 4:18 a.m. on February 1 , 1997 , a fire broke out in the Aisin Seiki company \u2019 s Factory No . 1 , in Kariya , a hundred and sixty miles southwest of Tokyo . Soon , flames had engulfed the plant and incinerated the production line that made a part called a P-valve\u2014a device used in vehicles to modulate brake pressure and prevent skidding . The valve was small and cheap\u2014about the size of a fist , and roughly ten dollars apiece\u2014but indispensable . The Aisin factory normally produced almost thirty-three thousand valves a day , and was , at the time , the exclusive supplier of the part for the Toyota Motor Corporation .\nWithin hours , the magnitude of the loss was evident to Toyota . The company had adopted \u201c just in time \u201d ( J.I.T . ) production : parts , such as P-valves , were produced according to immediate needs\u2014to precisely match the number of vehicles ready for assembly\u2014rather than sitting around in stockpiles . But the fire had now put the whole enterprise at risk : with no inventory in the warehouse , there were only enough valves to last a single day . The production of all Toyota vehicles was about to grind to a halt . \u201c Such is the fragility of JIT : a surprise event can paralyze entire networks and even industries , \u201d the management scholars Toshihiro Nishiguchi and Alexandre Beaudet observed the following year , in a case study of the episode .\nToyota \u2019 s response was extraordinary : by six-thirty that morning , while the factory was still smoldering , executives huddled to organize the production of P-valves at other factories . It was a \u201c war room , \u201d one official recalled . The next day , a Sunday , small and large factories , some with no direct connection to Toyota , or even to the automotive industry , received detailed instructions for manufacturing the P-valves . By February 4th , three days after the fire , many of these factories had repurposed their machines to make the valves . Brother Industries , a Japanese company best known for its sewing machines and typewriters , adapted a computerized milling device that made typewriter parts to start making P-valves . The ad-hoc work-around was inefficient\u2014it took fifteen minutes to complete each valve , its general manager admitted\u2014but the country \u2019 s largest company was in trouble , and so the crisis had become a test of national solidarity . All in all , Toyota lost some seventy thousand vehicles\u2014an astonishingly small number , given the millions of orders it fulfilled that year . By the end of the week , it had increased shifts and lengthened hours . Within the month , the company had rebounded .\nEvery enterprise learns its strengths and weaknesses from an Aisin-fire moment\u2014from a disaster that spirals out of control . What those of us in the medical profession have learned from the COVID-19 crisis has been dismaying , and on several fronts . Medicine isn \u2019 t a doctor with a black bag , after all ; it \u2019 s a complex web of systems and processes . It is a health-care delivery system\u2014providing antibiotics to a child with strep throat or a new kidney to a patient with renal failure . It is a research program , guiding discoveries from the lab bench to the bedside . It is a set of protocols for quality control\u2014from clinical-practice guidelines to drug and device approvals . And it is a forum for exchanging information , allowing for continuous improvement in patient care . In each arena , the pandemic has revealed some strengths\u2014including frank heroism and ingenuity\u2014but it has also exposed hidden fractures , silent aneurysms , points of fragility . Systems that we thought were homeostatic\u2014self-regulating , self-correcting , like a human body in good health\u2014turned out to be exquisitely sensitive to turbulence , like the body during critical illness . Everyone now asks : When will things get back to normal ? But , as a physician and researcher , I fear that the resumption of normality would signal a failure to learn . We need to think not about resumption but about revision .\nStart with health care as a delivery system . In this state of emergency , delivering care has required both personal protective equipment ( masks , gowns , gloves ) for medical personnel and devices ( including supplemental oxygen and ventilators ) for patients . In the absence of effective drugs , care is mainly supportive . As the pandemic advanced , the delivery of these goods to hospitals and clinics should have been akin to a soldierly deployment , a meticulous , co\u00f6rdinated response\u2014Toyota reassembling a supply chain within a matter of days . Instead , the medical infrastructure of one of the world \u2019 s wealthiest nations fell apart , like a slapdash house built by one of the three little pigs .\nN95 respirators , those heavy-duty face masks with two straps and a metal nose bridge , are a case in point . Before the pandemic , each cost between fifty cents and a dollar or so . They come in various sizes and styles , and every year health-care workers have their size \u201c fit tested , \u201d to make sure that air can \u2019 t get in around the edges .
