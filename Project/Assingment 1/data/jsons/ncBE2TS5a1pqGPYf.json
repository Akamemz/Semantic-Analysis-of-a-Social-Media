She said : \u201c I talked about sexual harassment , retaliation . The main word I used \u2013 and I know I didn \u2019 t use sexual harassment \u2014 I used \u2018 uncomfortable. \u2019 And I remember \u2018 retaliation . \u2019 \u201d\nReade described the report after the AP discovered additional transcripts and notes from its interviews with Reade last year in which she says she \u201c chickened out \u201d after going to the Senate personnel office . The AP interviewed Reade in 2019 after she accused Biden of uncomfortable and inappropriate touching . She did not raise allegations of sexual assault against Biden until this year , around the time he became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee .\nThe existence of the Senate report has become a key element of the accusations against Biden , which he has flatly denied . Reade says she doesn \u2019 t have a copy of the report , and Biden said Friday that he is not aware that any complaint against him exists . He asked the Senate and the National Archives to search their records to try to locate a complaint from Reade .\nBut Reade is suggesting that even if the report surfaces , it would not corroborate her assault allegations because she chose not to detail them at the time .\nAccording to a transcript of her 2019 interview with the AP , Reade said : \u201c They have this counseling office or something , and I think I walked in there once , but then I chickened out. \u201d She made a similar statement in a second interview with AP that same day , according to written notes from the interview .\nOn Friday , Reade said she was referring to having \u201c chickened out \u201d by not filing full harassment or assault allegations against Biden . In multiple interviews with the AP on Friday , Reade insisted she filed an \u201c intake form \u201d at the Senate personnel office , which included her contact information , the office she worked for and some broad details of her issues with Biden .\nOn Saturday , Reade told the AP there may have been a box to check on the form noting a sexual harassment complaint , but she couldn \u2019 t remember and wouldn \u2019 t know for sure until she saw the form .
