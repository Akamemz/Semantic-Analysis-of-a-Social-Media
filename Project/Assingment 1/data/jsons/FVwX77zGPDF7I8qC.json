''\nAdditional court challenges could also gum up the immigration system , Alito said .\n`` If courts must review credible-fear claims that in the eyes of immigration officials and an immigration judge do not meet the low bar for such claims , '' he wrote , `` expedited removal would augment the burdens on that system . ''\nThe ruling could stand to affect many asylum seekers in the future by stripping away the opportunity to go to federal court to contest a negative finding by immigration officials .\nCurrently , undocumented immigrants who are caught within 100 miles of a land border and within 14 days of arrival are subject to an expedited removal process and can be ordered removed without further hearing or review .
