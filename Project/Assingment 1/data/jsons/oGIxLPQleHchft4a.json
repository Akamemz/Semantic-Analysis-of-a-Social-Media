    "content": "We all remember the shortages that defined the early days of coronavirus lockdowns . Retail outlets responded as quickly as possible to shortages of toilet paper , hand sanitizer , and disinfectants . But then the supply chain disruptions hit the meat department of supermarkets everywhere . Consumers encountered empty coolers instead of packages of chicken or steak , and what was available was more expensive . Frustrations mounted .\nBut customers weren \u2019 t the only angry ones ; ranchers are also mad . It \u2019 s a little counterintuitive\u2014hamburger prices increased from as low as $ 1.84 a pound to more than $ 6 a pound\u2014so ranchers \u2019 anger doesn \u2019 t make much sense to the average American . Why wouldn \u2019 t the producers of hamburgers benefit from high prices for hamburgers ?\nThe answer is complex but important . The market for beef and pork isn \u2019 t just one market , but several . It is possible for the market for live cattle ready for slaughter to be in surplus , while the retail market is struggling to satisfy demand . That \u2019 s exactly what has happened during the pandemic : At the same time that retail prices spiked , farmers suffered from falling prices for their cattle . The extra money you paid for your ground beef went not to ranchers but to meat packers .\nFarmers , and the groups that represent them , are very conscious of that price gap , between farm and retail . Having been here before , we have a long list of policy solutions at the ready to improve producers \u2019 position in the marketplace . President Trump may have given renewed life to populism , but populism down on the farm has been around almost as long as cockleburs and grasshoppers . Most of the ideas presently rattling around coffee shops and convenience stores where we farmers gather have been tried before , and most have fallen by the wayside for perfectly good reasons , but we seemed destined to repeat every farm policy mistake of the past .\nToday \u2019 s populists , who come to their populism by way of the New York real estate market and Yale law school , have replaced the original Prairie Populists , but their rhetoric is just as heated . 150 years ago , Mary Elizabeth Lease supposedly said that \u201c farmers should raise more hell and less corn. \u201d The enemy then was railroads , and now processors , but we \u2019 re still raising hell .\nThe contrast between farmers profits and beef packer margins has been stark . On April 2 , 2020 , cattle feeders lost about $ 25 per head of cattle , while meat packers were making about $ 370 per carcass . A week later , packer margins had increased to $ 561 per head . The farm press is full of reports from cattle feedlots of losses reaching several hundred dollars a head . A revolt in farm country has been the result . And now ranchers\u2014and their allies in Congress\u2014seek to remedy this situation\nIowa Sen. Charles Grassley has reintroduced a bill that would require 50 percent of cattle to be traded in open markets , so as to bring increased transparency to pricing . Presently , unlike traditional agricultural markets , most transactions between buyer and sellers of market-ready cattle are private .\nMeanwhile , a large and growing contingent of farmers and farm groups would like to reinstate labeling of beef and pork by country of origin , or COOL , on the belief that the American consumer will seek out domestically produced food and willingly pay a premium for food produced here in the U.S .\nAn even bigger move would be to break up the large meat packers . Most farmers support dusting off antitrust laws to do just that , a little trust busting 120 years after the beginnings of the last great progressive wave . President Trump at a recent press availability spoke about ending trade agreements that allow cattle imports , remarking that we have \u201c a lot of cattle in this country. \u201d The trade agreement in question here would be the USMCA , which doesn \u2019 t even go into effect until July 1 . That would be a land speed record for throwing out an agreement , but the White House later walked back those remarks .\nLet \u2019 s look at how some of these ideas have worked out in the past .\nPresently , about 80 percent of beef is traded by formula or grid pricing , with no public price reporting . Formula pricing rewards producers for the quality of their animals and the practice is widely credited with improving the quality of beef on offer to consumers , by increasing uniformity of cuts of beef , as well as their tenderness . Grassley is concerned that the lack of transparency in the formula driven part of the market leads to lower prices and a paucity of bids . Whatever its merits , the Grassley bill , which the senator has introduced since 2002 , will limit market participants ' ability to choose how they buy and sell cattle .\nThe Justice Department recently indicted four chicken industry executives for price fixing . Tyson , a large player in chicken processing , has announced that it will cooperate in the Justice Department probe of its competitors . Tyson thereby avoids prosecution , according to news reports , but not coincidentally improves its competitive position . Unlike the other meat complexes , poultry processors market much of their product directly to consumers . Far better to be a cooperating witness than an indicted conspirator in the eyes of the consumer . If , as the Justice Department alleges , price competition no longer occurs in the chicken industry , we can be confident that no-holds-barred legal jockeying is alive and well .\nOne hundred years ago , the five biggest meatpackers ended decades of litigation by agreeing to an antitrust settlement with the Department of Justice . In 1980 , the top four firms in the industry had about 36 percent of the market . Today , the top four have 85 percent of the market , a level of market concentration higher than the level that sparked the antitrust litigation a century ago . Lawsuits were filed as long ago as 2015 alleging price manipulation in beef markets , and a slew of investigations have begun in the last few months . On June 4 , the Justice Department sent subpoenas to the four largest meat packers .\nNow let \u2019 s talk about origin labels . In 2009 , seven years after Congress passed legislation requiring the labeling of country of origin for a number of foodstuffs , including meat , the requirements finally went into effect . Canada and Mexico immediately complained to the World Trade Organization , arguing the labeling requirement discriminated against foreign livestock . This was not only true , but the whole point of the exercise . After six years of legal back and forth , the WTO found against the U.S. in 2015 , and granted Canada and Mexico the ability to retaliate with more than $ 1 billion in duties against U.S. exports . Congress quickly repealed COOL , and , while the labeling requirements for most of the items covered by the original COOL legislation remain in place , no labeling is required for beef and pork .\nBecause of changes in cattle prices around the time COOL was in effect and then repealed , it \u2019 s easy to understand why the attractiveness of the policy to beleaguered cattle producers support such a policy . In 2012 , the U.S. suffered from a historic drought . Ranchers and farmers had no grass for their cows and were forced to send cows to slaughter . It takes two years or so from the birth of a calf until it is ready to market . So , the diminished supply of slaughter-ready animals caused by the 2012 drought led to record prices for beef in 2014 and 2015 , just in time for the full implementation of COOL . Prices collapsed shortly after the repeal of COOL , as farmers rebuilt their herds and increased production in response to higher prices . Or perhaps consumers lost their taste for beef that no longer sported a label attesting to its domestic content . The Department of Agriculture has studied the issue , and found little consumer response to country of origin labels , but to producers , the collapse in prices and the repeal of COOL are not a coincidence . They are proof of a tremendous reservoir of untapped beef demand from consumers who refuse to eat imported hamburgers .\nIt \u2019 s far from certain that any antitrust investigations , rules telling market participants how to contract , or the reimplementation of labeling are likely to accomplish their stated goals , but the problem down on the farm is real , and it is urgent . The trade war with China has driven profits down for American farmers to the benefit of Brazlian farmers , prompting a farmer friend of mine to joke that we \u2019 ve managed to make Brazil great again . That self-inflicted wound has been followed by the pandemic , which has disrupted supply chains and cratered the ethanol market . Dairy farmers have been forced to dump milk , pig and chicken producers to euthanize animals , and farm prices are at lows not seen in this century . Government farm subsidies have kept farmers afloat , and farm subsidies that University of Missouri economist Pat Westhoff estimates that farm subsidies will be near $ 50 billion this year , well over half of a total farm income of $ 91 billion . An industry that is depending on a continued de facto adoption of modern monetary theory is an industry with an uncertain future .\nI \u2019 ve had a number of conversations with fellow farmers in recent weeks , all of whom have made the argument that the answer to our economic problems and the best defense against the pandemic-caused disruptions is total self sufficiency in the production and consumption of food and most other goods as well . Critics of food and agricultural imports compare our food supply issues to the recent controversy over medical supplies , arguing that food imports threaten national security .\nWhat we \u2019 re seeing is a sort of updated populism here in farm country . Few of us have read William Jennings Bryan and his Cross of Gold speech , but all of us are onboard with this famous line : \u201c Burn down your cities and leave our farms , and your cities will spring up again as if by magic ; but destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country . \u201d\nHowever , we \u2019 re on board for that part , but we \u2019 ve absolutely reversed field on the Prairie Populists \u2019 \u200bcall for lower tariffs . Our predecessors understood that tariff protection benefits industry while harming the consumer and the small farmer . They believed that low tariffs kept prices and profits down for big business and helped secure foreign markets to absorb the bounty of America \u2019 s farms . Now , tariffs are seen by most of my neighbors as benefitting workers , and imports are seen as a threat to not only to our industry but to U.S. national security .\nSelf-sufficiency is the buzzword , egged on by political leaders who think collapsing international supply lines can be accomplished by next Tuesday and done without harm to anybody except regimes that don \u2019 t have our best interests at heart . Farmers are a patriotic lot , and we support foreign and economic policy that treats China as a dangerous adversary . But a successful policy would , it seems to me , try to isolate China rather than isolate the U.S. , and particularly the U.S. agricultural sector . We should sign on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement immediately , improving trade with China \u2019 s neighbors , and helping to find a home for\u200b the\u200b 80 percent of our cotton crop that used to be exported , or the 50 percent of our soybean crop that is grown for foreign consumption .\nPerhaps the Justice Department investigation will find collusion and price fixing in the meat market . If so , then the response should be swift and powerful , and the full antitrust powers of the federal government should come into play .\nAntitrust actions increase competition where markets have been overwhelmed by anti-competitive behavior allowed by monopoly power . Most of the other solutions advanced in response to our present agricultural distress will lessen competition and lead to higher consumer prices and a smaller agricultural sector .\nCOOL will increase costs in the supply chain for beef , as segregating foreign products and U.S. products is difficult and costly . We \u2019 ll also face increased tariffs on goods we export to Canada and Mexico , as those two countries implement the tariffs that the WTO will allow.\u200b \u200b\u200bAlthough , since legislation has been introduced to withdraw the U.S. from the World Trade Organization , perhaps our former concerns about being a participant in the international trading system that \u2019 s been laboriously constructed over the past 70 years are outdated .\nEnding imports of beef is certainly an option , as imports are only about 10 percent of the market , and U.S. ranchers can easily supply American demand for beef . Of course , one of the main beneficiaries of that course of action will be domestic beef packers , who will no longer have to compete with foreign firms .\nWe can do all those things , but we \u2019 ll be consigning U.S. farmers and taxpayers to a difficult and painful future . Without the opportunity to maintain and increase exports of U.S. farm products , we have an agricultural sector that is fully a third too large . The only real answer to the populist revolt down on the farm is to follow the call of the original Prairie Populists , keep tariffs low , and trade with any who will trade with us .",
