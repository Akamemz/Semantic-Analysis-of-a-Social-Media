    "content": "President Trump is renewing his feud with former FBI Director James B. Comey as House Republicans consider holding his successor , Christopher Wray , in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over records related to the Russia probe that secured its first high-profile conviction Friday .\nRep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said the FBI and Department of Justice have for months \u201c stonewalled \u201d requests from his panel for documents pertaining to the salacious Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele .\nMr. Nunes issued an angry demand over the weekend and promised to take action . If the agencies do not meet all the House committee \u2019 s requests by close of business Monday , he said , he will promptly file a contempt resolution against Mr. Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein .\nThe disputes came two days after former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia \u2019 s ambassador to the U.S . In agreeing to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation , the probe of possible Trump campaign involvement with Kremlin meddling in the U.S. presidential election enters the president \u2019 s inner circle .\nBut the president had a few choice words for the FBI , saying in a series of tweets Sunday morning that the storied investigative agency \u2019 s reputation is in shambles and denying any personal jeopardy from Flynn \u2019 s plea and his cooperation with the Mueller probe .\n\u201c After years of Comey , with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation ( and more ) , running the FBI , its reputation is in Tatters \u2014 worst in History ! \u201d he said in one tweet . \u201c But fear not , we will bring it back to greatness . \u201d\nThe president cited reports that FBI investigator Peter Strzok , who led the agency \u2019 s email probe that ultimately cleared Hillary Clinton , was removed from Mr. Mueller \u2019 s Russia investigation for exchanging text messages with Lisa Page , a top FBI lawyer with whom he was having an extramarital affair .\nThe messages showed a possible bias for Mrs. Clinton and against Mr. Trump .\nMr. Nunes said he knew about Mr. Strzok \u2019 s demotion three months ago \u2015 but not the reasons for it , which were covered under the subpoena .\n\u201c By hiding from Congress , and from the American people , documented political bias by a key FBI head investigator for both the Russia collusion probe and the Clinton email investigation , the FBI and DOJ engaged in a willful attempt to thwart Congress \u2018 constitutional oversight responsibility , \u201d Mr. Nunes said .\nMr. Nunes said the agencies suddenly became more forthcoming with some information his panel had sought when Mr. Strzok \u2019 s dismissal was reported over the weekend .\n\u201c The DOJ has now expressed \u2014 on a Saturday , just hours after the press reports on Strzok \u2019 s dismissal appeared \u2014 a sudden willingness to comply with some of the committee \u2019 s long-standing demands , \u201d Mr. Nunes said . \u201c This attempted eleventh-hour accommodation is neither credible nor believable , and in fact is yet another example of the DOJ \u2019 s disingenuousness and obstruction . \u201d\nIn another tweet , Mr. Trump denied asking Mr. Comey to halt the investigation into Flynn , who faces up to five years in prison for falsely telling investigators he didn \u2019 t ask Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to limit Moscow \u2019 s reaction to U.S. sanctions during the presidential transition .\nIn his June testimony , Mr. Comey quoted the president as saying , \u201c I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . \u201d\n\u201c I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn , \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday morning . \u201c Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie ! \u201d\nMr. Trump also said over the weekend that the Flynn guilty plea showed no collusion between his aides and Russia and even took credit for dismissing Flynn in the first place for the same lies to which the former national security adviser pleaded guilty .\n\u201c I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI . He has pled guilty to those lies , \u201d Mr. Trump wrote Saturday on Twitter . \u201c It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful . There was nothing to hide ! \u201d\nMr. Trump previously said Mr. Flynn lost his White House job over misleading Vice President Mike Pence . In the tweet , the president expanded the explanation to cover the lie to the FBI .\nMr. Trump told reporters as he departed the White House on Saturday for New York City that the plea shows \u201c no collusion [ with Russia ] . There \u2019 s been absolutely no collusion , so we \u2019 re very happy . \u201d\nBut Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigators say Flynn was acting on the direction of at least one other senior Trump transition adviser , believed to be presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner .\nSen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , said Mr. Trump should learn his lesson and choose his words carefully during an open investigation .\n\u201c I would just say this to the president , there \u2019 s an ongoing criminal investigation , Comey may be a part of it , \u201d Mr. Graham said Sunday on the CBS talk show \u201c Face the Nation. \u201d \u201c You [ are ] tweeting comments regarding ongoing investigations at your own peril . I \u2019 d be careful if I were you , Mr. President . I \u2019 d watch this . \u201d\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California , the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said the panel is starting to see \u201c the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice \u201d against Mr. Trump , coming partly from \u201c the continual tweets \u201d from the White House on the FBI , Mr. Comey and Russia-related matters .\nMs. Feinstein said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d that she thinks Mr. Comey \u2019 s dismissal came \u201c directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation . \u201d\nSen. Mark R. Warner , Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , flatly said he didn \u2019 t believe Mr. Trump \u2019 s denials about trying to influence Mr. Comey .\n\u201c I believe FBI Director Comey , \u201d he said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union. \u201d \u201c I think he was very credible in his testimony , in his private meetings with us .\n\u201c This president has been obsessed with this investigation , always saying there \u2019 s nothing there , \u201d Mr. Warner said . \u201c But each week another shoe drops where we see more evidence of continuing outreach to Russians and some response by the Trump campaign and Trump individuals . \u201d\nFlynn \u2019 s guilty plea has further emboldened Capitol Hill Democrats , who say they now have ammunition to press the Republican leaders of congressional probes on Russia to intensify the investigations .\nMr. Warner categorized the Flynn guilty plea as part of \u201c an alarming pattern \u201d of White House efforts to interfere with the multiple Russia inquiries .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve had , clearly , you \u2019 ve had an attorney general who \u2019 s had to recuse himself because of untold contacts with the Russians . You had the president of the United States trying to intervene , as has been reported , with other national intelligence leaders , who he appointed , saying , \u2018 Can you back off ? \u2019 \u201d Mr. Warner said .\nThe Virginia Democrat pledged his panel would \u201c continue a thorough , bipartisan probe that follows the facts wherever they may lead . \u201d\nRep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland , the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , has spent months pressing the panel \u2019 s Republican chairman \u2014 Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina \u2014 to subpoena the White House for all documents related to Flynn .\nBut Mr. Gowdy has rejected requests for such a subpoena , saying that what the Democrats seek could lead to criminal penalties and arguing that \u201c Congress does not , and can not , prosecute crimes . \u201d\nThe House intelligence committee \u2019 s lead Democrat , Rep. Adam B.
