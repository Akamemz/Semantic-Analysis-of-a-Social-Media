Do yourselves a favor and pack it in now . Not so fast , cautions Allahpundit :\nThe Democratic turnout advantage in this model would be only a point less in Virginia and Florida than it was at the apex of Hopenchange in 2008 , and in Ohio it would actually be two points greater .

According to RCP \u2019 s averages , in fact , he \u2019 s up by just 1.3 points in Florida and 0.4 points in Virginia , and those numbers incorporate his gaudy leads in this WSJ/NBC poll .

That bounce now appears to be gone ; Ramussen \u2019 s daily tracker actually has Romney back in the lead today nationally .\nI 'll go a step further . Is Romney down by seven in Ohio as the NBC/WSJ poll says , or is he down by a single point , which two new polls show ? Or is he actually up three , as a poll taken last week indicated ? And is the Republican ticket trailing by five ( NBC ) or four ( Survey USA ) or two ( Rasmussen ) points in Florida , or are they ahead by three ( McLaughlin ) ? What about Virginia ? Lagging five points behind , or in the lead by the exact same margin ? In New Hampshire , Obama 's sitting at just 45 percent -- yet still leading Romney by five , but among the most highly motivated ( read : ultra-likely ) voters , the numbers swing nine points to Romney 's advantage . And as Dan wrote yesterday , Obama 's convention bounce has disappeared in the Rasmussen national tracker , with voters siding with Mitt on the economy by seven points .\nWhat 's my point ? That Romney 's really winning ? No . I 'd bet he 's roughly tied in Florida and Virginia , and down a few points in Ohio -- a tough state that he simply must have . I 'd also guess that the national race is a virtual dead heat , with Obama a shade ahead right now . What no one knows is what electorate will show up in November 6th . And there are several political eternities between then and now . The media will focus on good polls for Obama ( did anyone hear about the Romney up three in Ohio poll last week ? ) and write stories quoting anonymous Republicans `` privately fretting '' that Romney 's doomed . Romney could very well lose this election , but that outcome is far from decided . As the election draws closer , Democrats and their buddies in the press will consciously and subconsciously try to discourage Republicans and Republican leaners . A sense of despair does n't get people to the polls , which is exactly the point . It 's important for Romney supporters to remain clear-eyed and not delude themselves into believing that their candidate is somehow magically in the lead -- but also to resist the intentionally manipulative `` you 've already lost '' drumbeat from the Left . Things looked bleak for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George W. Bush in 2000 at this stage , and we remember how those races turned out . On the flip side , other campaigns just floated straight through into November with little change . The question is , will Romney ever manage to build serious momentum ?\nUPDATE - Today , Rasmussen boosts Romney 's national lead to three points , while the new NYT/CBS poll shows Obama ahead by the same margin . In the latter poll , Romney 's ahead among independents by double digits and Republicans have an enthusiasm advantage . Hmmm .",
