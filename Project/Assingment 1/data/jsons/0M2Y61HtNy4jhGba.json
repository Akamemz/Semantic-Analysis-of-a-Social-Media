    "content": "As 2018 drew to a close , Steve Pearlstein , the Washington Post \u2019 s Pulitzer Prize-winning business columnist , published a book that would \u2019 ve been bizarre only a few years before . It \u2019 s called Can American Capitalism Survive ? and it begins by laying bare the ideological crisis facing the economic system and , just as importantly , the economic philosophy that many Americans take for granted :\nA decade ago , 80 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that a free market economy is the best system . Today , it is 60 percent , lower than in China . One recent poll found that only 42 percent of millennials supported capitalism . In another , a majority of millennials said they would rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one .\nIn 2016 , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ran on a platform that many thought would \u2019 ve ruined his political chances . He ran as a democratic socialist , disavowing America \u2019 s longtime capitalist consensus and proudly wrapping himself in a label pundits considered political poison . And it worked .\nIn American politics , and particularly in the Democratic Party , the primacy of capitalism is , for the first time in ages , an open question . Sanders is expected to run again in 2020 , and to run with the support of a grassroots movement that thrills to his break with capitalist convention . He \u2019 ll face , among others , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who says one key difference between her and Sanders is that she \u2019 s \u201c a capitalist to my bones . \u201d\nBut what are the actual differences between liberal reformers of capitalism , like Warren and Pearlstein , and democratic socialists , like Sanders ? I invited Pearlstein to discuss his book , and the broader capitalism vs. socialism divide , with Bhaskar Sunkara , editor of the journal Jacobin , and author of the forthcoming book , The Socialist Manifesto . Their debate follows , lightly edited for style and length , with Sunkara kicking off the conversation .\nI just finished reading two interesting tracts this weekend , the White House Council of Economic Advisers \u2019 \u201d The Opportunity Costs of Socialism \u201d report and your new book Can American Capitalism Survive ?\nYours was better , don \u2019 t worry . But it strikes me as fascinating that \u201c capitalism \u201d and \u201c socialism \u201d are back in the popular discussion .\nYou come down firmly on the capitalist side , but see the need for major changes . In your view , old-school liberal models ( heavily regulatory , skeptical of consolidation , buttressed by powerful unions that made expansive wage and benefit demands ) encouraged stagnation and made American companies less competitive internationally .\nBut the neoliberal correction that came \u2014 mantras that emphasized that government could do no good , that businesses were bound by no other purpose than maximizing investor returns , and that any market outcome was just \u2014 was a radical overcorrection . It \u2019 s helped fuel a backlash that is threatening the foundations of the system itself .\nI \u2019 m a socialist , so I \u2019 m bound to disagree with some of your proposed solutions to the problem : employee profit-sharing , renewed but not stifling regulatory oversight , getting corporate money out of politics . I obviously don \u2019 t think this goes far enough .\nHowever , I \u2019 m interested in starting this conversation with our different views about the crisis of the 1970s and what drove the shift to supply-side economics . Unlike some liberals , I don \u2019 t deny that there was actually a crisis in the 1970s : corporations couldn \u2019 t keep up with militant union demands , the after-effect of the OPEC oil shock , and increased international competition . Profitability sagged .\nBut from your book , I noticed that you have a much bigger role for ideology than I do . In my account , without a broader ideological agenda , capital knew that it had to restructure to restore profitability . It saw regulations and strong unions as impediments to this goal . Neoliberal ideology seems to just follow these developments but not play a very important role in and of itself .\nI also question whether there was actually a different mentality that pervaded capitalism during the postwar boom years . A CEO like Charles Wilson could say \u201c what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa , \u201d but he was responding to the same exact market pressures as CEOs today . The only difference is that he was constrained by unions and a liberal political coalition .\nSocial democracy was always predicated on economic expansion . Expansion gave succor to both the working class and capital . When growth slowed and the demands of workers made deeper inroads into firm profits , business owners rebelled against the class compromise . And they were in the structural position to force their own solutions , even in countries like Sweden where there were experiments with wage-earner funds and other left-solutions to the crisis .\nIt seems to me that the goal isn \u2019 t to defeat neoliberal ideology , but rather to try to recreate the working-class political movements that help make shared prosperity possible . And that means heightening polarization \u2014 between working people and corporate interests \u2014 from the left and trying to build the kind of political movements that might be able to resolve the \u201c next crisis of the 1970s \u201d in a more radical direction .\nActually , we don \u2019 t disagree much about the genesis of the turn toward more market-friendly policies in the 1980s . I do think there were a set of ideas ( as distinct from a well-honed ideology ) were part of that transformation , but the driving force was the pressing need to restore the competitiveness of the US economy , that was seriously challenged from Japan and Europe at that time .\nIdeas are important at such moments because those participating in the policy and political debates need a rationale to convince the country that disruptive change is necessary . That process often involves shedding old ideas that were useful and we thought were true in favor of other ideas that are useful and true . In the political marketplace , ideas matter in terms of the outcome , even if they were not the driving force . That \u2019 s different than saying that ideology or some ideological movement played a starring role .\nSo in the book , I lay out several of those ideas and why they are have been pushed so far that they are no longer useful or valid .\nThe first is that greed is good and necessary for the workings of a market system , which now has been codified in the notion that businesses must be run to maximize return to shareholders .\nThe second is that market incomes are an objective measure of each person \u2019 s economic contribution \u2014 marginal utility , in the language of economics .\nThe third idea is that we don \u2019 t need to worry about the level of income inequality because all that really matters , at least in terms of morality and fairness , is equality of opportunity .\nAnd the fourth idea is that there is an absolute tradeoff between economic equality and economic efficiency \u2014 that if we want more equal slices , then we will have to accept the reality that the pie ( and thus each slice ) will be smaller .\nThese ideas now form the core of what might be called \u201c market fundamentalism , \u201d and explain why so many of your generation feel that capitalism has lost its moral legitimacy .\nOne theme running through the book is the importance of social norms . Social norms are very powerful in shaping how individuals and businesses behave . And while you apparently resist this idea , norms have changed a lot since the 1950s and \u2019 60s . In those days , businesses were indeed run with a broader purpose in mind , and executives who violated those norms were shunned not just by workers or customers or citizens in the local community , but by other executives and financiers .\nWhite-shoe law firms and investment banks just didn \u2019 t do hostile takeovers . Executives didn \u2019 t pay themselves enormous salaries . Very profitable companies shared those profits with all of their workers . Companies were loyal to their workers and expected loyalty in return . And that was true , by the way , at unionized and non-unionized companies .\nThere was a historical basis for these norms . We had just come out of wartime experience of shared sacrifice in which men of all types served with each other on the battlefield , and women of all types had worked side by side in factories and offices , and many essential goods were rationed equally to each household .\nThis shared experience was based on norms of equality , cooperation , trust . The idea that the only reason executives and businesses behaved in that way was because they were forced to by unions and a liberal political coalition is just wrong , although it is surely true that unions and liberal-minded voters and special interests had a hand in helping to shape those norms . And then norms changed .\nHow powerful are social norms ? Well , just look at the # MeToo movement , a wonderful example of a changing social norm . What used to be accepted and tolerated no longer is . This has been a bottom-up process that nobody anticipated and nobody controls . In terms of the power structure , which you like to focus on , very little changed other than public opinion .\nThe language with which you talk about these things , Bhaskar \u2014 framing things in terms of movements and ideologies and well-defined classes and interests \u2014 inevitably causes you to see things through a distorting lens . My goal is not to \u201c defeat \u201d any ideology , neoliberal or otherwise . Nor do I think it necessary to \u201c recreate a working-class political movement , \u201d which would be hard because , in America , we never really had one in the first place . What exactly do you have in mind \u2014 bookkeepers and baristas and computer technicians meeting in cells to plan general strikes and marches on the US Chamber of Commerce ?\nOur goal should be : Use all the tools available in a democratic society to convince a broad swath of the public \u2014 frontline workers , middle managers , professionals , executives , academics , journalists \u2014 that certain types of business behavior are no longer socially acceptable .\nUnacceptable because they offend our moral sensibilities . Unacceptable because they are economically counterproductive . And unacceptable because they erode the trust and cooperation that are necessary for a successful capitalism , and a successful democracy .\nChange the social norms in that way and the rules and laws naturally follow . That \u2019 s a goal that is more likely to be achieved , and more likely to be effective , than trying to change things by grabbing power and shoving a different set of rules and norms down everyone \u2019 s throats .\nI think we \u2019 re looking far differently at not only how to change what \u2019 s rotten in the United States today , but also how we \u2019 ve won improvements in the past . You say that our country has never really had a \u201c working-class political movement , \u201d but we do have a long history of labor turmoil \u2014 not just on the shopfloor , but wider movements for the eight-hour-day and the mass unionization drives of the 1930s and efforts to expand social protections .\nIt was the power of trade unions and the political culture that emerged out of them that helped ensure that the prosperity of the postwar period was more widely shared .\nWhat I have in mind for the future is quite simple : people banding together to defend their common interests through politics . We \u2019 re just a couple years removed from 13 million Americans voting for a self-described democratic socialist , someone who said that people deserve more than they \u2019 re getting and \u201c millionaires and billionaires \u201d were to blame .\nToday , most Americans support Medicare-for-all , jobs programs , and other social-democratic policies . As they try to get these things , they \u2019 re going to run up against the power of those who benefit from the status quo . That \u2019 s not the resistance of social norms , it \u2019 s the resistance of segments of capital \u2014 it \u2019 s class struggle in the most classical sense .\nNorms will follow those organizing efforts and conditions on the ground , and help consolidate gains , but I think you \u2019 re overstating their importance . There are powerful segments of business that existentially oppose things like Medicare-for-all and increased unionization , not as individual traits but to preserve their livelihoods . I don \u2019 t think the same can be said for # MeToo and other important struggles against sexism .\nConcretely , I think that means broad-based left electoral campaigns , combined with new trade union organizing efforts in strategically positioned sectors \u2014 the year \u2019 s wave of teacher strikes , new efforts to rally nurses and those in supply and logistics , for example , and social movements for things like criminal justice , health care , and affordable housing .\nThe words of A. Philip Randolph still seem apt to me : \u201c At the banquet table of nature there are no reserved seats . You get what you can take , and you keep what you can hold . If you can \u2019 t take anything , you won \u2019 t get anything ; and if you can \u2019 t hold anything , you won \u2019 t keep anything . \u201d\nEvery past advance \u2014 from the end of slavery to the creation of even our rudimentary welfare state \u2014 has come through struggle . The world and politics have changed , but I see no reason why the future will be any different .\nIf the left doesn \u2019 t speak to anger and try to \u201c grab power \u201d ( and by that I mean win a majority ) for our agenda , it \u2019 ll only benefit the xenophobes and scaremongers of the right .\nWho would disagree with your idea of people banding together to defend their common interests through politics ? But I think you are kidding yourself that the forces protecting the status quo are just millionaires and billionaires , and that all the rest of us are victims of the oppressive economic system they have imposed on us , or hoodwinked us into embracing .\nThat \u2019 s not to say the special interests , including business interests , don \u2019 t have disproportionate political and economic power . Of course they do . But there are all sorts of other special interests that I think you would recognize as mostly middle class in nature that have also shaped our system \u2014 like the ability to buy cheap goods from abroad or subsidies for homeownership .\nOurs is still a largely middle-class country , with standards of living that are equal to or exceed that of most other countries in the world . And these middle-class Americans wouldn \u2019 t favor Medicare-for-all , particularly if you explained to them what it would really mean , or 90 percent marginal tax rates on the super-rich , or guaranteed jobs or free public higher education . There is probably a bit more inner socialism the typical American can discover , but not as much as you imagine . Many are as distrustful of government as they are of Wall Street or large corporations .\nHow about let \u2019 s start with fixing the capitalism we have \u2014 or as Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales cleverly put it , saving capitalism from the capitalists . As I outlined in the book , I would start by getting money out of politics \u2014 corporate money but also union money . And ending the stranglehold Wall Street has put on the real economy be demanding companies be run to maximize shareholder value . And more vigorous antitrust enforcement to deal with old-fashioned consolidation and the natural winner-take-all tendencies of the new economy . We need to bring back a serious inheritance tax , a serious and reformed corporate tax and a top marginal income tax of 40 percent .\nAnd while we are at it , why not create a new set of financial institutions \u2014 banks , insurance companies , mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 that are owned by their customers rather than by shareholders . Even a capitalist can understand the logic of an annual \u201c dividend \u201d for every American as his or her share of the nation \u2019 s natural and institutional bounty , particularly if it is combined with an obligation for three years of national service ( my version of universal basic income ) .\nWant to get really radical ? How about ending school segregation by class the way we did with segregation by race , through enlarged school districts , magnet schools , and creative use of school choice .\nI \u2019 m all for making it possible once again to organize a union without getting fired or spending the next decade in court , which unfortunately is the current reality . But there may be other , better ways to reinvigorate the union movement and give a bit more power to workers in a post-industrial economy . My guess is that many American workers don \u2019 t want the kind of union you pine for \u2014 the ones that undermined the competitive viability of their companies , the ones that rejected all pay for performance schemes and saddled companies with rigid work rules .\nMaybe in a more professional , service , and tech-oriented economy , people would prefer unions that focused on providing services to their members ( pensions , health insurance , legal advice ) or providing mechanisms for them to have a greater voice in how their companies are run .\nYou are right that the teacher strikes have been as inspiring as they have been effective , but so has the # MeToo movement , which changed corporate behavior without unions or strikes but through public exposure and moral suasion .\nThe problem with your preferred model of permanent class struggle is that it ignores the importance of social capital \u2014 the trust in each other and in our common institutions \u2014 in much the same way that our current version of American capitalism does , with its ruthlessness , its inequality , and its celebration of greed and indifference .\nEconomic and political systems work best when there is a sense of shared purpose , shared sacrifice , and shared success , when people feel as if we are all in it together . But permanent class struggle , I fear , would discourage cooperation and erode trust \u2014 within firms , within communities , within countries .\nYour reply gets a fundamental difference between us : You seem to think that the state is neutral and simply responds to the demands of different special interests . So in the past , when labor was strong , labor made unreasonable demands on the state and now today big corporations do the same .\nBut even if you took away corporate lobbying and got \u201c money out of politics \u201d through publicly funded elections and elected figures like Bernie Sanders to high office , the state would still have a built-in bias . It relies on revenue to fund itself , and that revenue comes almost entirely from the activities of private capitalists . As long as capitalists have the power to withhold investment , a minority of people will hold tremendous sway and our democracy will be undermined .\nWere people hoodwinked into embracing a system like this ? No , workers and capitalists are dependent on each other . Workers need their firms to be profitable , and that recognition has always tempered demands . But it \u2019 s an asymmetrical dependency : Workers need their jobs more than capitalists needs any individual worker .\nPolitical democracy , won over the wishes of elites , has created avenues to improve the lot of working people through legislation and unions ( whose power rests most fundamentally in the ability of people to go on strike and withhold their labor ) , and that \u2019 s evened the odds a bit , but that inequality hasn \u2019 t gone away .\nAlong the same lines , your definition of \u201c middle class \u201d seems mythical to me . Who are these middle-class Americans ? Is it a nurse working double shifts , a bartender who saved up enough for a house and a car , or is it just highly educated professionals ? If you \u2019 re making these definitions based on just income level you \u2019 re missing the important difference in status and relationships to between that of a well-paid unionized worker and a small business owner that might be earning the same . And if you don \u2019 t get that difference , you don \u2019 t get why the former has to organize collectively to make gains .\nAnd finally , of course , I want to encourage cooperation and trust . I just want to do so through resurrecting a new identity based on a central unifying commonality of people : The vast majority of us have to work for a living . And we do so at the direction of other people . And we know that their interests aren \u2019 t the same as ours . This will be an identity filled with community , rituals , solidarity , and belonging , just like any other .\nWe live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality \u2014 not as an unintended aftereffect , but built in its core . Previous systems , from feudalism to slavery , built along these lines seemed natural and everlasting at the time . I \u2019 ll join you part of the way in your quest to humanize capitalism , but I have no doubt that overcoming it is necessary .\nYes , we live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality \u2014 and , yes , that \u2019 s intrinsic to capitalism . And , yes , power \u2014 economic power , political power \u2014 matters in terms of how the good things in life are distributed . Market fundamentalists who still insist it \u2019 s all about voluntary transactions within the context of a perfectly competitive and efficiency marketplace that neutrally and objectively sets economic outcomes are either kidding themselves or are trying to kid us .\nBut let \u2019 s be clear : This somewhat unsavory economic system called capitalism has lifted billions out of subsistence poverty since the industrial revolution and given us longer , healthier , happier lives to a degree not matched by any other system people have tried . And although some people have more power , money , security , and happiness than others , and some people get to boss other people around , the fault line is not between \u201c workers \u201d and \u201c capital. \u201d It \u2019 s between high-skilled workers and low , coastal metropolitan workers and rural ones , between white workers and nonwhite , men and women workers , religious workers and non-religious .\nLet \u2019 s get real : The favorite politician of the oppressed , left-behind workers who you idealize is Donald Trump , while denizens of Wall Street titans and Hollywood moguls and tech billionaires back liberal candidates and causes .\nOne fundamental flaw of your analysis is that , as Karl Marx before you , you see economics as a zero-sum game , \u201c We know that their interests are not the same as ours , \u201d you write . In fact , we don \u2019 t know that . Rather , we know of capitalist systems in which when companies do well , the owners of capital and the workers both do well \u2014 and that the cooperative nature of their relationship generates a bigger pie to divide .\nThe other fundamental flaw is that you ignore the power that each of us has in a capitalist system as workers and consumers . Most of us are not without choices . We choose who we work for and what products we buy and what norms will govern economic behavior . This economic power is not less real than our political power as voters , and can be exercised individually and collectively .\nAnd within this capitalist system , rich and powerful people who overplay their hands get their comeuppance all the time , losing their jobs , their fortunes and their reputations . Sometimes they even lose elections .\nBhaskar , the question isn \u2019 t whether there is inequality of wealth and power . The question is whether those lucky or talented enough to have wealth and power use it in socially beneficial ways .",

And unacceptable because they erode the trust and cooperation that are necessary for a successful capitalism, and a successful democracy.\n\nChange the social norms in that way and the rules and laws naturally follow. That\u2019s a goal that is more likely to be achieved, and more likely to be effective, than trying to change things by grabbing power and shoving a different set of rules and norms down everyone\u2019s throats.\n\nBhaskar Sunkara\n\nI think we\u2019re looking far differently at not only how to change what\u2019s rotten in the United States today, but also how we\u2019ve won improvements in the past. You say that our country has never really had a \u201cworking-class political movement,\u201d but we do have a long history of labor turmoil \u2014 not just on the shopfloor, but wider movements for the eight-hour-day and the mass unionization drives of the 1930s and efforts to expand social protections.\n\nIt was the power of trade unions and the political culture that emerged out of them that helped ensure that the prosperity of the postwar period was more widely shared.\n\nWhat I have in mind for the future is quite simple: people banding together to defend their common interests through politics. We\u2019re just a couple years removed from 13 million Americans voting for a self-described democratic socialist, someone who said that people deserve more than they\u2019re getting and \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d were to blame.\n\nToday, most Americans support Medicare-for-all, jobs programs, and other social-democratic policies. As they try to get these things, they\u2019re going to run up against the power of those who benefit from the status quo. That\u2019s not the resistance of social norms, it\u2019s the resistance of segments of capital \u2014 it\u2019s class struggle in the most classical sense.\n\nNorms will follow those organizing efforts and conditions on the ground, and help consolidate gains, but I think you\u2019re overstating their importance. There are powerful segments of business that existentially oppose things like Medicare-for-all and increased unionization, not as individual traits but to preserve their livelihoods. I don\u2019t think the same can be said for #MeToo and other important struggles against sexism.\n\nConcretely, I think that means broad-based left electoral campaigns, combined with new trade union organizing efforts in strategically positioned sectors \u2014 the year\u2019s wave of teacher strikes, new efforts to rally nurses and those in supply and logistics, for example, and social movements for things like criminal justice, health care, and affordable housing.\n\nThe words of A. Philip Randolph still seem apt to me: \u201cAt the banquet table of nature there are no reserved seats. You get what you can take, and you keep what you can hold. If you can\u2019t take anything, you won\u2019t get anything; and if you can\u2019t hold anything, you won\u2019t keep anything.\u201d\n\nEvery past advance \u2014 from the end of slavery to the creation of even our rudimentary welfare state \u2014 has come through struggle. The world and politics have changed, but I see no reason why the future will be any different.\n\nIf the left doesn\u2019t speak to anger and try to \u201cgrab power\u201d (and by that I mean win a majority) for our agenda, it\u2019ll only benefit the xenophobes and scaremongers of the right.\n\nSteve Pearlstein\n\nWho would disagree with your idea of people banding together to defend their common interests through politics? But I think you are kidding yourself that the forces protecting the status quo are just millionaires and billionaires, and that all the rest of us are victims of the oppressive economic system they have imposed on us, or hoodwinked us into embracing.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the special interests, including business interests, don\u2019t have disproportionate political and economic power. Of course they do. But there are all sorts of other special interests that I think you would recognize as mostly middle class in nature that have also shaped our system \u2014 like the ability to buy cheap goods from abroad or subsidies for homeownership.\n\nOurs is still a largely middle-class country, with standards of living that are equal to or exceed that of most other countries in the world. And these middle-class Americans wouldn\u2019t favor Medicare-for-all, particularly if you explained to them what it would really mean, or 90 percent marginal tax rates on the super-rich, or guaranteed jobs or free public higher education. There is probably a bit more inner socialism the typical American can discover, but not as much as you imagine. Many are as distrustful of government as they are of Wall Street or large corporations.\n\nHow about let\u2019s start with fixing the capitalism we have \u2014 or as Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales cleverly put it, saving capitalism from the capitalists. As I outlined in the book, I would start by getting money out of politics \u2014 corporate money but also union money. And ending the stranglehold Wall Street has put on the real economy be demanding companies be run to maximize shareholder value. And more vigorous antitrust enforcement to deal with old-fashioned consolidation and the natural winner-take-all tendencies of the new economy. We need to bring back a serious inheritance tax, a serious and reformed corporate tax and a top marginal income tax of 40 percent.\n\nAnd while we are at it, why not create a new set of financial institutions \u2014 banks, insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds \u2014 that are owned by their customers rather than by shareholders. Even a capitalist can understand the logic of an annual \u201cdividend\u201d for every American as his or her share of the nation\u2019s natural and institutional bounty, particularly if it is combined with an obligation for three years of national service (my version of universal basic income).\n\nWant to get really radical? How about ending school segregation by class the way we did with segregation by race, through enlarged school districts, magnet schools, and creative use of school choice.\n\nI\u2019m all for making it possible once again to organize a union without getting fired or spending the next decade in court, which unfortunately is the current reality. But there may be other, better ways to reinvigorate the union movement and give a bit more power to workers in a post-industrial economy. My guess is that many American workers don\u2019t want the kind of union you pine for \u2014 the ones that undermined the competitive viability of their companies, the ones that rejected all pay for performance schemes and saddled companies with rigid work rules.\n\nMaybe in a more professional, service, and tech-oriented economy, people would prefer unions that focused on providing services to their members (pensions, health insurance, legal advice) or providing mechanisms for them to have a greater voice in how their companies are run.\n\nYou are right that the teacher strikes have been as inspiring as they have been effective, but so has the #MeToo movement, which changed corporate behavior without unions or strikes but through public exposure and moral suasion.\n\nThe problem with your preferred model of permanent class struggle is that it ignores the importance of social capital \u2014 the trust in each other and in our common institutions \u2014 in much the same way that our current version of American capitalism does, with its ruthlessness, its inequality, and its celebration of greed and indifference.\n\nEconomic and political systems work best when there is a sense of shared purpose, shared sacrifice, and shared success, when people feel as if we are all in it together. But permanent class struggle, I fear, would discourage cooperation and erode trust \u2014 within firms, within communities, within countries.\n\nBhaskar Sunkara\n\nYour reply gets a fundamental difference between us: You seem to think that the state is neutral and simply responds to the demands of different special interests. So in the past, when labor was strong, labor made unreasonable demands on the state and now today big corporations do the same.\n\nBut even if you took away corporate lobbying and got \u201cmoney out of politics\u201d through publicly funded elections and elected figures like Bernie Sanders to high office, the state would still have a built-in bias. It relies on revenue to fund itself, and that revenue comes almost entirely from the activities of private capitalists. As long as capitalists have the power to withhold investment, a minority of people will hold tremendous sway and our democracy will be undermined.\n\nWere people hoodwinked into embracing a system like this? No, workers and capitalists are dependent on each other. Workers need their firms to be profitable, and that recognition has always tempered demands. But it\u2019s an asymmetrical dependency: Workers need their jobs more than capitalists needs any individual worker.\n\nPolitical democracy, won over the wishes of elites, has created avenues to improve the lot of working people through legislation and unions (whose power rests most fundamentally in the ability of people to go on strike and withhold their labor), and that\u2019s evened the odds a bit, but that inequality hasn\u2019t gone away.\n\nAlong the same lines, your definition of \u201cmiddle class\u201d seems mythical to me. Who are these middle-class Americans? Is it a nurse working double shifts, a bartender who saved up enough for a house and a car, or is it just highly educated professionals? If you\u2019re making these definitions based on just income level you\u2019re missing the important difference in status and relationships to between that of a well-paid unionized worker and a small business owner that might be earning the same. And if you don\u2019t get that difference, you don\u2019t get why the former has to organize collectively to make gains.\n\nAnd finally, of course, I want to encourage cooperation and trust. I just want to do so through resurrecting a new identity based on a central unifying commonality of people: The vast majority of us have to work for a living. And we do so at the direction of other people. And we know that their interests aren\u2019t the same as ours. This will be an identity filled with community, rituals, solidarity, and belonging, just like any other.\n\nWe live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality \u2014 not as an unintended aftereffect, but built in its core. Previous systems, from feudalism to slavery, built along these lines seemed natural and everlasting at the time. I\u2019ll join you part of the way in your quest to humanize capitalism, but I have no doubt that overcoming it is necessary.\n\nSteve Pearlstein\n\nYes, we live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality \u2014 and, yes, that\u2019s intrinsic to capitalism. And, yes, power \u2014 economic power, political power \u2014 matters in terms of how the good things in life are distributed. Market fundamentalists who still insist it\u2019s all about voluntary transactions within the context of a perfectly competitive and efficiency marketplace that neutrally and objectively sets economic outcomes are either kidding themselves or are trying to kid us.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: This somewhat unsavory economic system called capitalism has lifted billions out of subsistence poverty since the industrial revolution and given us longer, healthier, happier lives to a degree not matched by any other system people have tried. And although some people have more power, money, security, and happiness than others, and some people get to boss other people around, the fault line is not between \u201cworkers\u201d and \u201ccapital.\u201d It\u2019s between high-skilled workers and low, coastal metropolitan workers and rural ones, between white workers and nonwhite, men and women workers, religious workers and non-religious.\n\nLet\u2019s get real: The favorite politician of the oppressed, left-behind workers who you idealize is Donald Trump, while denizens of Wall Street titans and Hollywood moguls and tech billionaires back liberal candidates and causes.\n\nOne fundamental flaw of your analysis is that, as Karl Marx before you, you see economics as a zero-sum game, \u201cWe know that their interests are not the same as ours,\u201d you write. In fact, we don\u2019t know that. Rather, we know of capitalist systems in which when companies do well, the owners of capital and the workers both do well \u2014 and that the cooperative nature of their relationship generates a bigger pie to divide.\n\nThe other fundamental flaw is that you ignore the power that each of us has in a capitalist system as workers and consumers. Most of us are not without choices. We choose who we work for and what products we buy and what norms will govern economic behavior. This economic power is not less real than our political power as voters, and can be exercised individually and collectively.\n\nAnd within this capitalist system, rich and powerful people who overplay their hands get their comeuppance all the time, losing their jobs, their fortunes and their reputations. Sometimes they even lose elections.\n\nBhaskar, the question isn\u2019t whether there is inequality of wealth and power. The question is whether those lucky or talented enough to have wealth and power use it in socially beneficial ways.",
