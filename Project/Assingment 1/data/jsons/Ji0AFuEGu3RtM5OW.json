Yes , Mike Flynn had a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on Dec. 29 regarding American policy toward that country . Yes , there is an ancient and little-known piece of legislation , the Logan Act , which makes it illegal for private citizens to conduct foreign policy , and yes , that law was put forth to justify accusations Flynn had committed a crime in his conversation with Kislyak .\nBut as a national security advisor designate it \u2019 s hardly realistic to have considered Flynn a private citizen , and he wasn \u2019 t going to be charged with anything for that conversation .

What Flynn had discussed , per an interview he did with the Daily Caller before he was forced out , was the status of the 35 Russian diplomats Obama had expelled from the country . He contends Kislyak raised the issue and was told it would be reviewed after the inauguration \u2014 but he made no promises to the Russian .\nThe expulsions were considered part of the sanctions , and therefore Flynn \u2019 s representation to Pence would go down as inaccurate \u2014 and the resulting media scandal following Pence \u2019 s reliance on Flynn \u2019 s statements to pass the adviser \u2019 s contention on in a TV interview ultimately made Flynn too hot to handle .\nBut this goes far beyond the Beltway scandal machine which is now running at top gear after largely idling for the past eight years spitting out its first Trump administration victim .
