    "content": "Like many Americans , Jimmy Wolfe has been deeply discouraged by the presidential election this year .\nIt \u2019 s not simply because of what seems to be a rampant incivility during current political campaigns , says Mr. Wolfe , a part-time accountant who lives in Woodstock , Ga. , with his wife and four children . It \u2019 s the fact that just having a mutually engaging conversation \u2013 let alone a friendship or meaningful relationship with someone with differing political views or from a different culture \u2013 has become less and less likely .\nHis own political instincts remain conservative , he says \u2013 though he hasn \u2019 t yet decided if he will vote for Donald Trump on Nov. 8 . But for a number of years now , he \u2019 s considered it part of his vocation , rooted in his faith , to try to find a way to foster spaces where white suburbanites can build meaningful friendships with black residents in Atlanta \u2013 two groups with a long history of deep divisions .\n\u201c Politically , whether it \u2019 s guns , race relations , or crime , everyone in the country always says we need to have a \u2018 national conversation , \u2019 \u201d Wolfe says . \u201c It ends up being on TV or social media , but people hardly have the relationships that allow us to have real , transforming conversations . \u201d\nHis discouragement with the political process this year has been painful for him , too , for reasons deeply personal . Nearly every week , Wolfe drives from his suburban home to spend some time with his former foster son , a black child who now lives with his father in Atlanta \u2013 two relationships that have in many ways changed his life .\nSuch efforts as Wolfe 's take time and deep personal investment , however \u2013 hardly a feature of Twitter era . And the fact is , the nation has been on a trajectory of `` sorting '' itself into clear political and geographical tribes , exacerbating stark political divisions , and leading to the apparent rise in public vitriol , scholars say .\n\u201c Fewer and fewer people are interacting on a regular basis with coworkers , neighbors , and even some friends and family who share a different perspective , \u201d says Amy Black , a political scientist at Wheaton College in Illinois , who last month gave a public forum on \u201c Political Civility in Uncivil Times. \u201d \u201c So we \u2019 re getting more of an echo chamber , you live in a neighborhood with people who all vote alike , and all of your friends that you interact with all share your political views . \u201d\nAs a result , as people have fewer opportunities to interact with people who hold different political views or share different underlying values , Professor Black continues . \u201c Then they become foreign , they become alien to us , the other . In the same way that when we do n't have racial diversity , or economic class diversity , it \u2019 s harder to understand people from different perspectives and ideologies . \u201d\nDespite his own conservative views , Wolfe says he 's learned one idea through the relationships he \u2019 s developed : the fact of his own privilege , and efforts like his to reach out and perhaps help some of those living in poverty , can smack of paternalism and even self-congratulation . Even events that are meant to assist those living in poverty , he says , \u201c they may be helpful for a time , but they don \u2019 t lead to friendships and relationships or unity among us . \u201d\nBy establishing relationships , real conversations can begin . He still believes in the importance of individual decisions \u2013 both to avoid self-destructive behavior and improve society . But now he also has a deeper grasp of issues of systematic injustice , and finds himself defending the idea when other conservatives dismiss it .\n`` When it \u2019 s closer to home , it \u2019 s a lot messier , '' Wolfe says of some of the political issues dividing the nation . `` The issues are a lot less clear , and you find you have to let go of some of your politics , some of your viewpoints from the way you were raised , because poverty and race , they \u2019 re messy topics . ''\nIt doesn \u2019 t help , either , that national political conversations are mostly transmitted through a media that is structured around split-screen shouting matches , or migrate to social media platforms in which anonymous vitriol is often the basic feature .\n\u201c These are almost inherently dehumanizing , \u201d says David Gushee , a evangelical professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University in Atlanta . \u201c And now even public event conversations are rarely helpful \u2013 I wish I could say different , I \u2019 ve been in so many of them \u2013 but all it takes is a couple of extreme people to hijack the conversation and get everybody angry . \u201d\nLike Wolfe , Professor Gushee looks to conversational spaces that are rooted within invested relationships \u2013 perhaps within classrooms or congregations \u2013 those friendships built over time .\n\u201c But that \u2019 s a long , slow process , \u201d he says . \u201c You take a person of a fixed conviction , and then you bump them into another person of a fixed conviction that \u2019 s different , but they care about each other , so they have an investment in a relationship , and because they do , they \u2019 re not willing to just walk away angry . So they keep talking . \u201d\nFor him , the journey indeed took time . Considered one of the leading evangelical thinkers on topics of ethics , he had always maintained a traditional view of marriage and the precepts forbidding homosexual behavior . But as he experienced the deep pain this caused members of his family and close friends in the churches he attended , his thinking began to shift dramatically .\n\u201c So then you end up with this inner conflict for a while , \u201d says Gushee . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to harm anybody , you \u2019 re supposed to love people . But it seems like believing these things , and teaching them , is harming people . So then what do I do ? '' He described this process in his 2014 book , \u201c Changing Our Mind , \u201d which offers a biblical defense of LGBT sexual ethics from a particular evangelical and theologically conservative perspective .\n\u201c There are core experiences , core beliefs that don \u2019 t change that much , but then life happens , \u201d Gushee says . \u201c You meet people and you watch history unfold and you see things happening around you , and start thinking fresh thoughts . You read some new books , and some things begin to change . \u201d\nIn a very different way , Utah state Sen. J. Stuart Adams also experienced a political transformation through his relationships with his LGBT constituents . A veteran of the bruising culture war battles over same sex marriage in Utah , he watched as the state was forced to nullify its constitutional amendment establishing marriage as between a man and a woman by a federal judge in 2013 .\n\u201c I stood locked arms with my colleagues as we passed that constitutional amendment , \u201d he says . And after same sex marriage was forced upon one of the most conservative states in the US , the political climate was \u201c like a big freight train coming at us . We were going to have an explosion in Utah that would probably make Indiana and Arizona and North Carolina look like a summer afternoon picnic . \u201d\nBut then something extraordinary happened . He and others , including members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , began to talk to LGBT rights advocates , and listen to their experiences and worries . Through a process of engaged conversation , Adams says , he and his colleagues became willing to pass civil rights legislation that protected LGBT people from discrimination in housing and employment .\nAs a result , Utah became the first \u2013 and only \u2013 Republican-led state to include such LGBT protections , while at the same time bolstering the state \u2019 s religious freedom exemptions . Both of these explosive issues continue to roil many red states across the nation .\n\u201c Finally the light went on , \u201d Senator Adams says . \u201c I thought it was best to restrict other people 's ability to have rights in order to protect my own . I actually thought I was protecting my own rights . And then after going through this process , and I kind of thought about it \u2013 I am a Christian , and I believe in the New Testament and loving your neighbor , and doing good to those who perhaps who hate you . \u201d\n\u201c Now I \u2019 m living my religion , \u201d continues Adams , who has been traveling around the country to share Utah \u2019 s experience with what is called the \u201c Fairness for All \u201d concept , which seeks to expand both LGBT protections and religious freedom rights , and rise above the culture war battles that are still tearing apart other states . Without compromising his religious convictions , \u201c I \u2019 m being more compassionate and tolerant , and I \u2019 m now getting respect on the other side back . \u201d\nStill , there \u2019 s a sense in which politics is never going to be a pillow fight . For one thing , ideas and policies need to be debated vigorously to be thoroughly vetted , scholars say . The concern is whether there 's room for efforts to find transformation in engaged relationships rooted in honest efforts to understand and respect those with differing views .\nOn the one hand , civil public discourse is a baseline of decent behavior in a democracy , and engaged conversations and decent behavior form the bedrock of self governance , according to Keith Bybee , a law professor at Syracuse University in New York and the author of \u201c How Civility Works. \u201d \u201c If civility is meant to be the zero point for appropriate behavior , then incivility undermines the rudiments of social order and all is lost , \u201d he writes .\nBut standards of civility are themselves subject to political dispute , he cautions . And politicians often break these standards of civility for strategic reasons , as part of their political tactics .\n\u201c We shouldn \u2019 t identify every breach of decorum as a signal that there are no manners , \u201d Professor Bybee says . \u201c Provocation is a time honored political tactic , and we \u2019 ve seen a lot in this campaign . \u201d\nDuring the founding of the country , federalists thought the country was on the verge of crisis , and they saw the rough and ready politics flourishing in the states as an 18th century version of a `` basket of deplorables . '' And though long forgotten now , one of the charges leveled against the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s was that it breached long established \u201c standards of etiquette that surrounded and sustained Jim Crow segregation , an etiquette itself that enacted and sustained a ritual hierarchy . \u201d\nSimilarly , current movements such as the tea party and Black Lives Matter often resort to a politics of disruption , and though the process may not be pleasant all the time , that doesn \u2019 t have to mean that incivility has broken down and that we stand at the brink of barbarism .\nNevertheless , there does have to be a standard of civility that communicates to political opponents that you care about behaving decently . \u201c That \u2019 s the critical feature , \u201d Bybee says . `` You have to want to look good in my eyes , and I have to care that I look good in your eyes . \u201d\n\u201c If we have a deeply polarized country , and then Democrats and Republicans do n't care what the other one thinks about them , that \u2019 s when we have a problem . That \u2019 s profound , that involves a kind of dehumanizing of our opponent . They are not people we disagree with , they are enemies of the state , enemies of the people . \u201d\nPart of Wolfe \u2019 s frustration is that this is what he often encounters among conservative and liberal sides both : hypocrisy , stereotypes , and judgmentalism expressed in abstract , dehumanizing terms .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\u201c My instincts are conservative , but I try to be open to the possibility that I am wrong \u201d when he discusses politics , he says \u2013 though he thinks a close friendship should develop first before broaching political subjects .\n\u201c And you have to do an internal search , \u201d Wolfe continues . \u201c What do I really want ? Do I really want to be friends and have unity with this person , or do I want to be right ? ... But if you really want to understand or build a friendship , then you have to lay aside that need to be right and when you do that , then you \u2019 re a lot more willing to listen . \u201d",
