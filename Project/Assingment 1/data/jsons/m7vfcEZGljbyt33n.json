    "content": "Congress is weighing options for bolstering U.S. defenses against North Korea , with new legislation arriving in the coming week that would increase the number of anti-missile systems on the West Coast .\nSen. Dan Sullivan ( R-Alaska ) will unveil a bill that asks for 28 additional Ground-Based Interceptors in Alaska and California , increasing by more than 30 percent the number of interceptors currently in the United States .\n\u201c If you want to protect the continental United States , Alaska is literally the front line and the best place and to do that from an attack from North Korea , \u201d a Senate staff member familiar with the bill told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c Sullivan is not doing this because it \u2019 s potentially good for Alaska , he \u2019 s doing this because [ North Korean leader ] Kim Jong Un is continuing to test and advance his programs . \u201d\nNorth Korea does not yet have the technology to reach the West Coast with a missile , but Sullivan has spoken out against Pyongyang 's efforts to develop a weapon , urging fellow members of the Senate Armed Services Committee to prepare for a ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S .\n\u201c That 's going to happen , \u201d the GOP senator said last month at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .\nThe bill comes as North Korea on Sunday fired a missile that landed in the Sea of Japan , according to the Pentagon .\nU.S. Pacific Command detected and tracked the missile , the first such launch in two weeks , and flight data indicated that `` the flight was not consistent with an intercontinental ballistic missile , '' the Pentagon statement reads .\nThe interceptors are part of the U.S. government 's Ground-based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ) system , a network meant to protect the country against a limited nuclear attack .\nThe U.S. already has 30 interceptors , with four at Vandenberg Air Force Base along the California coast in Santa Barbara County and the rest at Alaska 's Fort Greely . The Obama administration also signed off on plans to add 14 more to Alaska by the end of 2017 .\nSullivan 's bill does not state the cost of the 28 additional interceptors , but the senator is framing the increase as an insurance policy .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t say they \u2019 re expensive and I wouldn \u2019 t say that they \u2019 re cheap , \u201d the Senate staff member said . \u201c I put it in the context of what is an American city worth ? \u201d\nThe bill would also ask the Missile Defense Agency to speed up the development of new missile interceptors by accelerating testing . In addition , it asks the agency to review the possibility of buying more of the current interceptors .\n\u201c It \u2019 s asking the Defense Department to figure out , up to a certain number , what the right amount of interceptors might be , what the cost might be and where they should be located to include Alaska , \u201d the staff member said .\nGMD , conceived under the Clinton administration and made operational by President George W.
