    "content": "The First Amendment again drew national attention this week as two high-profile right-wing personalities appeared at prestigious universities on separate coasts to denounce what they say is an attack on free speech at college campuses across the country .\nOn Sunday , right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos addressed a crowd at the University of California , Berkeley \u2019 s historic Sproul Plaza . The 20-minute speech was a decidedly truncated version of the four-day \u201c Free Speech Week \u201d Mr. Yiannopoulos had been touting since his last scheduled appearance here was canceled in April . ( According to reports , the necessary permits and fees were not filed this time . ) Still , his presence drew dozens of counter-protesters who decried racism and white supremacy and whose shouts , Yiannopoulos later wrote on Facebook , \u201c made it impossible for any of our speakers to be heard . \u201d\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions , at a talk on Tuesday at Georgetown University in Washington , told his audience , \u201c Protesters are now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to silence voices that insufficiently conform with their views. \u201d As he spoke , about 100 students and faculty reportedly gathered outside the closed venue with signs reading , \u201c Deport hate \u201d and \u201c Free speech is not hate speech . \u201d\nIn choosing to speak about what they see as the growing limits on free expression , Mr . Sessions and Yiannopoulos continue to fortify a familiar right-wing refrain : that elite liberals and their insistence on political correctness are drowning out conservative voices , especially in the university setting .\nThe narrative , political analysts note , reflects a significant if gradual shift in the conservative position on the First Amendment . For most of the past century , conservatives aligned themselves with restrictions around speech ; it was liberals who traditionally championed expansions to protected expression .
