Four years ago , 17 % of those surveyed reported obtaining their news from social media platforms , while 36 % relied on Internet news sources . Today , 65 % report receiving their news from digital sources .\nThe reach of the Internet will allow clips of the debates to be played over and over again . The extensive political media , ranging from television to the Internet , and the vast expansion of political news will offer opportunities for the debates to be rehashed over many days , if not weeks , in a way that was not true in previous years .\nNever have there been two candidates who are better prepared to take advantage of television debates like these two . Of course , Trump thrives when the cameras are rolling . Without any hesitations about what he will do or say to keep attention focused on him and to attack his opponents , Trump is prepared to create the kind of spectacle that plays well for a generation of Americans who have grown up with the modern , no-holds-barred media .\nHe also is a television performer who achieved his biggest celebrity through his NBC show , `` The Apprentice , '' not his record in real estate . Unless the moderators are fully prepared for his onslaught , as Lauer 's stumbling performance last week demonstrated , Trump is capable of dominating the event and defining its tone and tenor .\nClinton is no slouch , either . She has spent most of her time since 1992 ( and to some extent before then ) in the media spotlight . We have seen how she can keep her steely demeanor even in the midst of an onslaught of televised attacks from opponents and that she knows how to get under the skin of an adversary . If Trump is totally confident that he will be victorious , he might want to take a look at the Benghazi hearings , when she testified for hours without losing her composure and made her Republican interrogators look like hotheads who were stumbling all over the place .\nSimply put , both Trump and Clinton have the potential to put on a riveting performance that either win more voters to the GOP or produce the kind of exodus toward the Democratic Party that some of Clinton 's supporters are now predicting .\nThe three debates will also matter since both campaigns are centered on character assassination . For Clinton , the goal is to prove to voters that Trump is unfit to hold this office . He is not stable , he is untrustworthy , he is not knowledgeable , and he is fundamentally a danger to the Republic . For Trump , the goal is to prove that Clinton is a liar , that she is not as competent as she says , and that she does not have the demeanor to be president ( a claim steeped in gendered assumptions ) .\nThe one-on-one confrontation will be their best bet at making the other candidate play to character , and as a result sparks will fly as they descend into a bitter and nasty fight .\nSo get ready for a battle royale .
