    "content": "An overwhelming majority of all U.S. adults ( 92 % ) said in late March that they were fairly or very closely following news about the COVID-19 pandemic that has dominated media coverage for weeks . But within that large share , some notable differences emerge by age \u2013 particularly among those following news most closely .\nThose differences are most pronounced between the youngest and oldest Americans , according to survey data that is part of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Election News Pathways project . More than two-thirds of adults ages 65 or older ( 69 % ) said they were following news of the pandemic very closely . At the other end of the spectrum , about four-in-ten Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 ( 42 % ) said they were paying as much attention to COVID-19 news . Those adults ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 fall in between .\nFurthermore , these differences persist over time . Even as the public \u2019 s attention to news about the coronavirus outbreak grew from the first half to the second half of March , that growth did not occur equally across all age groups , with attention among the youngest cohort remaining behind others .\nAmericans were asked how closely they are following coronavirus news , first in a survey administered from March 10-16 , 2020 , among 8,914 U.S. adults and again in a survey from March 19-24 among 11,537 adults . ( All survey participants are members of the Center \u2019 s American Trends Panel . ) In that short period of time \u2013 when reported U.S. COVID-19 cases and fatalities quickly mounted and efforts by government and public health experts to respond to the outbreak intensified \u2013 overall attention to news about the outbreak remained extremely high , with the share following it very closely rising from 51 % to 57 % over this period .\nSome age groups intensified their attention , while others did not . The portion of those ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 following the news very closely grew about 10 percentage points . On the other hand , the portion of those ages 18-29 and 65 and older following coronavirus news very closely remained largely unchanged .\nFrom mid to late March , the percentage following COVID-19 news very closely grew among middle-aged groups , while youngest adults remained least engaged\nIt is difficult to recall an event that has commanded as much public attention for as extended a period of time as the current COVID-19 outbreak .\nIn a first survey conducted March 10-16 , fully 89 % of U.S. adults said they were fairly or very closely following coverage of the story . The other 11 % said they were following it not too closely or not at all closely .\nA second survey was conducted just a short while later , from March 19-24 . In that time , news and events related to the virus occurred at a breakneck pace : the U.S. neared having the most confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide , New York City became the epicenter of the virus , professional sports teams , public schools closed in many areas across the country and many governors began ordering state residents to stay at home , while reported cases and confirmed deaths in the U.S. about tripled .\nDuring this period , the portion of Americans who said they were following news about the coronavirus fairly or very closely remained extremely high , at 92 % , with some increase in those expressing the greatest intensity . Roughly half ( 51 % ) reported following the news very closely in mid-March , a figure that grew to 57 % later that month .\nWithin those following COVID-19 news the most , differences emerge by age , both in general and over time . The youngest age group , those ages 18 to 29 , has remained the least engaged with COVID-19 news ; the oldest \u2013 those ages 65 and older \u2013 has been the most engaged . Those ages 30 to 49 and ages 50 to 64 fall in between , but their attention grew over time .\nWant to see more data on these questions ? To analyze these survey questions by additional media habits and demographic characteristics , visit the dataset .\nThe share of those ages 30 to 49 who said they were following coronavirus coverage very closely rose 10 percentage points , from 44 % to 54 % . Among people ages 50 to 64 , the percentage following news about the pandemic very closely rose by nine points \u2013 up from 54 % to 63 % .\nAttention among those ages 65 and older did not change much between the two time periods , but this may largely be due to their very high level of interest from the outset . Even during the first survey , fully two-thirds said they were following news very closely , something that could reflect both the news consumption habits of senior citizens as well as warnings that they were among those most vulnerable to the new virus . In the March 16-24 survey that number remained largely unchanged at 69 % .\nBut the increasingly sobering news of the pandemic had little impact on the group paying the least attention , those 18 to 29 years of age . Four-in-ten said they were following news about the virus very closely in the first survey , a figure that remained almost the same later in March ( 42 % ) .\nAll in all , the youngest adults , those ages 18 to 29 , are the least likely to say they are following news about the coronavirus very closely , while the oldest adults ages 65 and older are the most likely to do so . That level of engagement remained consistent from mid to late March .\nThese measures and more can be explored further in the Election News Pathways data tool , where all of the data associated with this project is available for public use .
