    "content": "One of Donald Trump \u2019 s top campaign promises \u2014 a trillion-dollar program to rebuild highways , tunnels , bridges and airports \u2014 is already meeting resistance from conservatives .\nThe president-elect has vowed that his infrastructure proposal will create \u201c millions \u201d of jobs , likening it to Dwight Eisenhower \u2019 s creation of the interstate highway system . It \u2019 s one piece of his agenda that \u2019 s drawing support from Democrats , who love public works programs just as much as Trump loves to brag about his experience building golf courses and skyscrapers .\nBut Trump \u2019 s 10-year infrastructure proposal could offer an early test of how some of his more unconventional policy ideas will fly with conservative Republicans in Congress \u2014 even though he hasn \u2019 t made it clear whether much , or even any , of that $ 1 trillion would come from federal coffers .\nDan Holler , spokesman for the group Heritage Action for America , questioned the job-creation claims for such plans , in the same way that conservatives have scoffed at the benefits of President Barack Obama \u2019 s $ 832 billion stimulus .\n`` Conservatives do not view infrastructure spending as an economic stimulus , and congressional Republicans rightly rejected that approach in 2009 , \u201d said Holler , whose group is the political arm of The Heritage Foundation .\nHe said Congress should devote its energies to other items on Trump \u2019 s wish list .\n\u201c It would be a mistake to prioritize Big Government endeavors over important issues like repealing Obamacare , reforming our regulatory system and expanding domestic energy production , \u201d Holler said . \u201c Along with confirming a conservative justice to the Supreme Court , these are the type of legislative efforts that will help anxious families and folks struggling all across the country . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s proposal even drew flak from the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a conservative group that his transition team has turned to for advice on his environmental policies . \u201c There is little evidence that these public works projects promote long-run economic growth , \u201d CEI fellow Marc Scribner wrote Thursday in a blog post on \u201c The Great Infrastructure Myth . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s unclear whether these critiques presage major problems for Trump \u2019 s plan , which he has yet to put forth in more than skeletal form .\nThe language Trump has put out so far suggests that his actual infrastructure spending would amount to far less than $ 1 trillion in federal money \u2014 relying instead on policy strategies like tax credits to spur private investment in transportation projects . He also hasn \u2019 t suggested any fix for the government \u2019 s perpetually cash-strapped Highway Trust Fund , which relies on a federal gasoline tax that Congress hasn \u2019 t hiked for 23 years .\nEven so , Trump cheered infrastructure advocates from both parties when he gave the issue a prime mention during his victory speech early Wednesday .\n\u201c We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways , bridges , tunnels , airports , schools , hospitals , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We \u2019 re going to rebuild our infrastructure \u2014 which will become , by the way , second to none \u2014 and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it . \u201d\nFor transportation supporters , the vocal buy-in from the developer-turned-politician spawned hope that his plan may get a warmer welcome from Congress than Obama \u2019 s most recent infrastructure proposals received .\n\u201c I think that the X factor , the missing ingredient , has been in presidential leadership , \u201d one GOP industry lobbyist said. \u201c It \u2019 s been a real champion at the White House who really puts his or her shoulder into it . \u201d\n\u201c He gets all of that instinctively , \u201d another transportation lobbyist said . \u201c That \u2019 s all very positive . \u201d\nSenate Commerce , Science and Transportation Chairman John Thune ( R-S.D . ) and House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster ( R-Pa. ) both gave Trump \u2019 s proposal some encouraging though noncommittal words Thursday . Thune said through a spokesman that he \u201c supports enacting a national infrastructure improvement plan , \u201d while a spokesman for Shuster \u2019 s committee said he \u2019 s \u201c encouraged \u2026 that the idea of addressing transportation is gaining some traction in Washington . \u201d\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio , the top Democrat on the Banking Committee , said he expects the topic to be a top priority for the panel next year , noting that \u201c both presidential candidates proposed badly needed infrastructure investments that will help get Americans back to work. \u201d Hillary Clinton \u2019 s five-year , $ 275 billion infrastructure proposal would have relied on revenue from some vaguely defined tax overhaul \u2014 though Trump boasted that his plan was bigger .\nOn Wednesday , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told fellow Democrats that her party wants to work with Trump `` to pass a bill very fast , '' according to a source on a conference call .\nThe group Building America \u2019 s Future \u2014 chaired by Democratic former Pennsylvania Gov . Ed Rendell , former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 pledged to work with Trump and Congress \u201c to tackle this unifying issue in the first 100 days. \u201d Pete Ruane , CEO of the American Road and Transportation Builders Association , invoked Trump \u2019 s post-election comments about \u201c healing \u201d after a bruising campaign , saying that \u201c the bipartisan aspect of this is compelling . \u201d\nLamenting the \u201c crumbling \u201d state of the nation \u2019 s roads and bridges has been a bipartisan pastime for years . Both Trump and Vice President Joe Biden have bemoaned the \u201c Third World \u201d condition of New York \u2019 s LaGuardia Airport , where Trump often lands his private Boeing 757 .\nBut Congress has been stuck for years on the question of how to pay for such projects , with suggestions such as bonds , enhanced revenues from tax reform , some hoped-for peace dividend or a hike in the gasoline tax all coming and going with no action .\nTrump will most likely have great sway with the GOP-held Congress , however , especially after his surge in the polls helped Republicans retain control of the Senate . Having the same party in charge of Congress and the White House certainly opens \u201c the opportunity to solve a critical problem in a way that has lasting benefits and impact , \u201d said Katie Thomson , a former general counsel at the Department of Transportation who now works at the firm Morrison Foerster .\nAs Pelosi \u2019 s remarks show , Democrats may also be eager to sign onto a bill that promises to boost domestic spending . \u201c There is a potential irony here , in that his more natural allies on specific items may actually be Democrats , \u201d Rep.
