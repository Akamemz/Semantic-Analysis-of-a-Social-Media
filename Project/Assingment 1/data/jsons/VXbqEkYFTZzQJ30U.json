    "content": "David Greenberg , a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers , is a contributing editor at \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine . His most recent book is Republic of Spin : An Inside History of the American Presidency .\nThe American War of Independence was fought from April 19 , 1775 ( Lexington and Concord ) to September 3 , 1783 ( the Peace of Paris ) , and although Massachusetts and some other states observe the first of those dates as Patriots \u2019 Day , neither has become a national holiday . It \u2019 s July 4 , of course , that reigns as our undisputed Independence Day\u2014the occasion for picnics and parades , festivities and fireworks , and star-spangled , red-white-and-blue kitsch . That was when the representatives at the Second Continental Congress , the 13 colonies \u2019 newly formed governing body , signed the Declaration of Independence , our nation \u2019 s founding document , which is still often read aloud , 241 years later , at July 4 celebrations across the land .\nSince 1776 , the Declaration of Independence has assumed a near-biblical status in America \u2019 s national mythology\u2014its opening paragraphs memorized by schoolchildren , its formulation of liberal principles of equality and self-government venerated by citizens of all political stripes . It still provides a trump card for its chief author , Thomas Jefferson , who in recent years has been increasingly scorned for the libertarian elements of his thought and for his slaveholding .\nBut in truth the Declaration wasn \u2019 t quite the singular achievement we remember it to be . As it turns out , nearly 100 other \u201c declarations of independence \u201d had already been issued in the months leading up to July 4th , 1776 , by states , towns , counties , and assorted other bodies . The Declaration of Independence endorsed at the Continental Congress that July wasn \u2019 t a bolt out of the blue : It was more like a final draft in a loose , many-centered , wide-ranging process , authored not by one man but by a chorus of voices in a fledgling nation whose people had caught independence fever and were suddenly proclaiming it with contagious enthusiasm .\nIn the spring of 1776 , talk of independence was everywhere . In that heady but fearful time , with the Continental Army already at war against British troops , military battalions in Pennsylvania endorsed independence . So did mechanics in New York and grand jurors in South Carolina . Declarations of separation from the Crown were issued , too , by the people of Topsfield , Massachusetts ; of King \u2019 s District , New York ( part of Albany County ) ; of Anne Arundel Country , Maryland\u2014and by almost every colonial assembly .\nToday , when it often feels as if Americans are spiraling apart , becoming less connected to our political leaders and less bound to one another , it \u2019 s worth remembering what made independence possible wasn \u2019 t just a spirit of rebellion ; it was the way that spirit was harnessed to a newfound commitment to self-government across the diverse colonies . What we celebrate today isn \u2019 t only the colonists \u2019 unity in rejecting British rule but also the condition that made it possible : the trust that the colonists placed a group of leaders tasked with a historic decision , and the fidelity those leaders showed to the people \u2019 s wishes . We celebrate not just independence but also democracy .\nFor this deeper understanding of the Declaration \u2019 s origins , we can thank the late Pauline Maier , one of the great historians of the revolutionary period , whose 1997 book American Scripture : Making the Declaration of Independence recovered these rich documents and plumbed their importance in the story of the republic . Somehow , despite being published in a time of rampant \u201c Founders Chic \u201d \u2014alongside a raft of best-selling biographies by Joseph Ellis , David McCullough , Ron Chernow , and others\u2014Maier \u2019 s more cerebral , analytical work never penetrated the popular consciousness . Yet the new account it gave of the Declaration \u2019 s genesis remains a watershed in the historiography of our nation \u2019 s foundational document .\nAmerican Scripture is the story of the how the Declaration of Independence came to be written and how it later came to be enshrined as the quintessential American statement of human equality . It joins a long line of other historical accounts , from Carl Becker \u2019 s in the 1920s to Garry Wills \u2019 s in the 1970s . What distinguished Maier \u2019 s history was the evidence she marshaled to show that Jefferson \u2019 s Declaration , long hailed as the epitome of his unique intellect and importance as an Enlightenment philosopher , was anything but the work of a lone , brilliant mind .\nFor one thing , as historians know well , Jefferson \u2019 s draft was worked over by a committee of the Continental Congress that included Benjamin Franklin and John Adams ( probably the colonies \u2019 most august political thinker until the younger James Madison reached his full powers ) , and by the Continental Congress as a whole . But Maier \u2019 s more important discovery\u2014or rediscovery , really , since they \u2019 d been compiled in an important 19th century book of primary documents\u2014was the resurrection of these other , prior declarations of independence , which showed the Declaration to be the culmination of a set of ideas that had been burgeoning for months .\nIn 1776 , bonds between the colonists and Britain were as frayed as ever . Tensions had been growing since the end of the French and Indian War in 1763 , but even after the 1770 Boston Massacre or the 1773 Boston Tea Party , talk of independence remained marginal . Even after Lexington and Concord , most Americans saw themselves as loyal subjects of King George III . They sought only a redress of a range of grievances relating to taxation , representation in government , and other issues .\nBut the experience of being at war deepened feelings of enmity , and the intransigence of the king \u2019 s public statements\u2014from an October 1775 speech to Parliament that reached America in January , to his reply to a petition he received from the City of London , which Americans learned about in May\u2014led colonists to despair of reconciliation . Moreover , the widespread popularity of Thomas Paine \u2019 s radical tract Common Sense\u2014which not only argued that it was irrational to be ruled by a government across the sea , but took aim at monarchy altogether , ecstatically claiming that \u201c the birth-day of a new world is at hand \u201d \u2014reinforced the conviction that a divorce was not just necessary but desirable .\nColonists expressed this newfound conviction in the \u201c declarations of independence \u201d that Maier discovered . A handful of these were self-consciously drafted in the same spirit as the Declaration we know today\u2014proclamations issued by Virginia or New Jersey that formally disavowed British rule as a prologue to establishing their own constitutions . Others were simply enunciations of the sentiments of bodies that lacked formal political power but wished to take part in a conversation occurring across the colonies . Several came in the form of instructions issued by colonial legislatures to their congressional delegates , who had assembled in Philadelphia and were by the spring of 1776 taking up the question of independence . The state and local proclamations were meant to contribute to\u2014to be in conversation with\u2014the grand debates and discussions taking place in Philadelphia .\nThe everyday colonists \u2019 declarations of independence from Britain give evidence that they considered the work of their appointed delegates to be of consummate importance . Assertive as they were in challenging the king , they deferred to what one town called \u201c the well-known wisdom , prudence , justice , and integrity of that honourable body the Continental Congress. \u201d Their conception of democracy was predicated on a regard for and trust in their chosen leaders . And the leaders , in turn , had regard for the will of the people . As one delegate to the Continental Congress put it , Congress wouldn \u2019 t call for a formal split until \u201c the voice of the people drove us into it , \u201d since \u201c without them , our declarations could not be carried into effect . \u201d\nThe documents that the people drafted exhibited a striking consistency in their reasoning and language . In place of Paine \u2019 s sweeping calls for a new age of mankind , colonists offered detailed , particular , pragmatic reasons for severing their bonds with Britain . The \u201c declaration \u201d was a familiar form , a genre , with roots in British politics , and colonists emulated past declarations , especially the English Declaration of Rights of 1689 , which had justified the deposition of King James II . Following this form , colonists enumerated the specific wrongs committed by King George , citing mainly the offenses of the last two years\u2014especially the Prohibitory Act of 1775 , which blockaded American ports\u2014and not the longer train of incidents dating to the 1760s . Also common to most of these documents was the claim that the call for separation was a last resort\u2014a step taken only because the king had rejected their previous entreaties and no alternatives remained .\nIn this climate , Richard Henry Lee of Virginia , on June 7 , 1776 , proposed to the Continental Congress that the colonies should be \u201c free and independent states. \u201d The Congress then named a drafting committee\u2014which came to be called the Committee of Five\u2014consisting of Jefferson , Franklin , Adams , Roger Sherman of Connecticut and Robert Livingston of New York . Jefferson , recognized as an eloquent writer , produced the first draft , borrowing ideas and tropes that were in the assorted declarations and that were , more generally , in the colonial air . ( \u201c He was no Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from the hand of God , \u201d Maier noted , \u201c but a man who had to prepare a written text with little time to waste and who \u2026 drew on earlier documents of his own and other people \u2019 s creation. \u201d ) In particular , he mimicked the practice of listing the particulars of King George \u2019 s \u201c abuses and usurpations \u201d that warranted the break : failing to recognize colonial laws ; obstructing colonial trade ; imposing oppressive taxes ; quartering troops in colonists \u2019 homes ; and so forth . Like the previous documents , too , Jefferson \u2019 s framed the assertion of independence as a last resort , not undertaken \u201c for light and transient causes. \u201d On the contrary , he wrote , the colonists had repeatedly \u201c petitioned for redress in the most humble terms , \u201d but \u201c our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury . \u201d\nThe Continental Congress edited Jefferson \u2019 s draft , making its most extensive changes on the bill of particulars against King George , and doing little to the now-famous first two paragraphs . Over time , the Declaration \u2019 s agreeable cadences , its well-articulating reasoning , and its expressed intention of respecting \u201c the opinions of mankind \u201d \u2014along with , of course , the enormous political significance of the separation from Britain that it announced\u2014made it the subject of worldwide attention . The Enlightenment ideas about self-government so eloquently expressed in its opening words have not only buttressed American politicians and activists of every persuasion but have also inspired movements for national autonomy around the world . Yet as much as we admire these noble articulations of liberal principles , its main goal was to set forth a clear-cut case against King George and his mistreatment of his American subjects .\nIt doesn \u2019 t diminish Jefferson or his colleagues on the Committee of Five to recognize that contrary to our national mythology , they weren \u2019 t producing an original work of political philosophy . The job of politicians\u2014and intellectuals , for that matter ( and Franklin , Jefferson , and Adams were obviously both ) \u2014typically isn \u2019 t primarily to generate brand-new ideas of whose wisdom they then try to persuade the public . More often they seek to find the words to convey ideas that they intuit will strike a chord with a wider audience . Jefferson himself said the Declaration of Independence was meant to be \u201c an expression of the American mind . \u201d\nPauline Maier \u2019 s history of the Declaration elevates the role of \u201c the people \u201d in revolutionary history . She belonged to a generation of historians who tried to expand the study of the past beyond \u201c great men \u201d to focus on regular citizens . American Scripture did that , broadening our understanding of how the Declaration of Independence came to be written\u2014even if that broadened understanding hasn \u2019 t yet reached far beyond the academy \u2019 s walls . Most people still tend to see the Declaration as something like a work of philosophy , rather than an instrument of concrete political needs . Restoring the document , as Maier did , to its immediate place and time\u2014not just Philadelphia but the whole of colonial America , in the months when the fervor for independence was spreading\u2014allows us to see it as an example of what effective democratic politics can look like , with citizens communicating , formally and informally , with respected leaders .\nThe colonists \u2019 belief in popular sovereignty involved trusting that their delegates would carry out the people \u2019 s sentiment\u2014and by the same token , the delegates \u2019 understanding of their roles involved recognizing their obligation to honor the people \u2019 s instructions . Today , the mutual trust between the public and its elected leaders on which democracy depends seems to be in short supply . But its preciousness is worth celebrating .",
