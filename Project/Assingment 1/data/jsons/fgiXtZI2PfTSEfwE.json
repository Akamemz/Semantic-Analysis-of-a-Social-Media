He built a happy campaign operation that achieved all of its ambitious goals . Cruz elbowed out candidate after candidate to consolidate support among social conservatives , Tea Partiers and libertarians in the Republican field . He raised considerable amounts of money to build a political apparatus unrivalled in the GOP field .\nThere was only one problem . Every successful move , every stratagem that took Cruz \u2013 who dropped out of the presidential race on Tuesday night after a disastrous loss in Indiana \u2013 from an ambitious Ivy Leaguer to one of the final three Republican candidates for the presidency prevented him from attaining the ultimate goal .\nThe Texas Republican was elected to the Senate in 2012 after winning a bitter primary as a Tea Party candidate . He was positioning himself for a White House bid almost from the get-go , travelling to Iowa for presidential cattle calls less than six months into taking office . In a legislative body that values tradition , Cruz \u2019 s undisguised ambition didn \u2019 t help him make friends . But what really alienated colleagues was his push to shut down the government in October 2013 in an attempt to defund Obamacare , the president \u2019 s signature healthcare reforms . The quixotic effort alienated almost all of his colleagues who were left calling him a \u201c wacko bird \u201d and viewed him as an amoral opportunist who would do anything for his own political gain .\nCruz did nothing to alter his image when he became the first candidate for the White House in 2016 to announce his campaign , in an event at Liberty University in Virginia in March last year . He was then racing to beat competitors with stronger roots in Iowa \u2013 such as Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee \u2013 to be the first out of the starting gate .\nCruz \u2019 s message that day was consistent with what the Texas senator would say every day on the campaign trail until the moment he withdrew from the race in Indianapolis on Tuesday . He told a crowd of college students : \u201c I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America \u201d and pledged to \u201c reclaim the constitution \u201d .\nIn fact , Cruz \u2019 s campaign was remarkable for its consistency . There was only one key issue on which Cruz changed his message significantly in the course of the campaign \u2013 Donald J Trump .\nFor months after Trump \u2019 s entry into the race , Cruz engaged in a virtual bear hug with the New York billionaire . Immediately after Trump said that Cruz \u2019 s Senate colleague John McCain , a former POW who was tortured in Vietnam , was not a hero , Cruz called him a friend .\nHe told reporters in Iowa in July 2015 : \u201c I recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican on Republican violence . So you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump or bad about John McCain or bad about anybody else . I am not going to do it . John McCain is a friend of mine . I respect and admire him .

Donald Trump is a friend of mine . \u201d\nIn contrast , the then candidate Rick Perry immediately condemned Trump and called on him to drop out of the race .\nThis pattern continued throughout 2015 .
