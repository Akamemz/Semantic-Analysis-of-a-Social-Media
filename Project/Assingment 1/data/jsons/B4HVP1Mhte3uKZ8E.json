    "content": "Her words are already long gone from the daily flow ; in fact , they never really resonated at all , were all but ignored by the mainstream media , and were characterized more as a feisty in-your-face comeback than what they truly were .\nAnd what they truly were was horrifying \u2014 but at the same time a deep insight into the Democratic mindset , as well as a peek at what may be coming in 2016 .\nLast week , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton finally appeared to answer questions before two congressional panels on exactly what happened at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , on Sept. 11 , 2012 .\nThat day , the consulate was overrun by heavily armed terrorists , some with rocket-propelled grenade launchers , others with high-powered assault weapons . They swept past the almost nonexistent security , killed the U.S. ambassador and set the building on fire . They followed when dozens of Americans fled to a more-heavily fortified annex nearby , but U.S. forces did nothing during the next 10 hours and three more were killed , including two Navy SEALs .\nFor weeks , the White House and top administration officials said the assault was merely a protest turned violent : The angry mass had gathered to protest a short video posted on YouTube that Muslims reportedly found offensive . It was , they said , spontaneous , and it was , they said , all about that video .\nThe hearing last week was a fact-finding mission : Lawmakers charged with oversight of the State Department gathered to ask the secretary of state \u2014 for the first time \u2014 what went wrong , and to find out , if possible , the cause of the deadly blunder . More , they wanted to hear from the secretary herself just why the administration had said for so long that a video caused an impromptu protest that led to the death of the U.S. ambassador .\nAsked during a Senate hearing why they had given out faulty information for so long , Mrs. Clinton grew angry and , with her voice rising , he hands flailing , said : \u201c With all due respect , the fact is we had four dead Americans . Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided to go kill some Americans ? What difference , at this point , does it make ? ! \u201d\nAnd that , in a nutshell , sums up the frightening Democratic mindset . The administration had buried the matter for months in an internal investigation : No one from the White House to the State Department would comment on what happened , turning away queries with the simple : \u201c It \u2019 s under investigation. \u201d And they weren \u2019 t about to start explaining now .\nRemember , the story had changed completely just hours before another congressional hearing months earlier . State Department officials , speaking with anonymity , had scrambled to hold a hastily-arranged conference call with reporters to say , in essence , \u201c Oh , turns out it was terrorists , not just protesters , who attacked in Benghazi . And oh , nothing to do with any video. \u201d That call came just before officials planned to tell a completely new story , but this time to lawmakers , where \u2014 as Mrs. Clinton learned after her husband \u2019 s affair with a White House intern \u2014 lying under oath is a felony .\nSo , lawmakers still wanted to know why the administration dispatched aides to the Sunday talk shows right after the deadly attack to say it was the culmination of a spontaneous attack over a video . Later , Mrs. Clinton and President Obama would say that they were merely offering up the best information at the time , but as information dribbed and drabbed out over the following months , it turned out that no one in the intelligence community ever said the attack was spontaneous or caused by a video posted on YouTube nearly six months earlier .\nBut Mrs. Clinton made clear at the hearing that she didn \u2019 t have to answer to anyone \u2014 certainly not elected lawmakers , let alone the American people . \u201c What difference does it make ? ! \u201d she bellowed . Now , this hearing was in fact a hearing intended to find out why the administration said the attack came after an impromptu protest over a video . Senators made clear in the days preceded the hearing that they planned to ask just that , get the answer to that most pressing unanswered question .\n\u201c You know , to be clear , \u201d the secretary explained , as if to children , \u201c it is , from my perspective , less important today , looking backwards , as to why these militants decided they did it [ sic ] , than to find them and bring them to justice . \u201d\nSo , from her perspective , there doesn \u2019 t need to be any investigation into why the administration said what it said . It \u2019 s like a child breaking a lamp , lying about it to his parents , and then saying , \u201c Look , we could go on and on about who said what about breaking the lamp , but fixing the lamp now is really all that \u2019 s important \u2014 let \u2019 s move on . \u201d\nAnd that is terrifying . The secretary of state said simply , \u201c The ends justify the means. \u201d The Obama administration had lied about what happened in Benghazi to help secure a second term for the president , buried the murder of Americans in a private investigation , then , when finally questioned , said , \u201c What difference does it make ! ? \u201d what we said way back then .\nThe tactic is , of course , how Democrats operate . They feel that what they are doing is morally superior ; thus , however they can achieve their goals is above question or reproach . In fact , in this case , they can lie about it \u2014 bald-faced \u2014 and then dismiss lawmakers \u2019 questions with an indignant huff .\nIt is , as we know , exactly how the Clintons operate . Bill Clinton lied for weeks and months over his sexual dalliance with an intern only a few years older than his daughter \u2014 even under oath \u2014 and Democrats decried the probe as a witch hunt . Remember when Mrs. Clinton made $ 100,000 through spurious cattle futures contracts ? Of course not : By the time it all came around , the Clintons said , \u201c Oh , that old stuff ? \u201d Or the time the Clintons announced they had suddenly found papers demanded by investigators for years ? And don \u2019 t even ask about Vincent W. Foster Jr .\nThis is what \u2019 s coming in 2016 . A politician running for president who need not answer questions from anyone .\n\u2022 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
