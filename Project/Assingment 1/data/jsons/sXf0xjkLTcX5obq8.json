The program is now set to end on March 5 , six months after US Attorney Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration planned to phase out DACA , which has protected as many as 800,000 undocumented people .\nThe failure to protect these people would be a tragedy , because the program has changed many , many lives for the better , as my research and that of others has shown . It took them out of limbo and let them contribute to their families , communities , and the US economy .\nWhen the Obama administration launched DACA in 2012 , it amounted to a natural experiment : What would happen if you gave a portion of the overall population of undocumented immigrants fresh access to employment and other opportunities ?\nImmigrants who applied for protection under the program \u2014 enrollment is not automatic \u2014 were at least temporarily shielded from deportation . They also got temporary Social Security numbers and two-year work permits . To qualify , they had to have arrived in the US before 2007 ( at 15 years old , or younger ) , been 30 or younger in 2012 , and either have a high-school degree or be enrolled in high school or similar educational program .\nWhen the program began , I started a national research project to study the effects on its beneficiaries . Those effects were profound : Under DACA , beneficiaries saw increased educational attainment , higher social mobility , and better mental health .\nMy research into undocumented immigrants predates DACA . From 2002 to 2015 , I followed 150 undocumented young adults in Los Angeles , examining how they transitioned to adulthood in a context of limited rights . In Lives in Limbo : Undocumented and Coming of Age in America , I compared a group of people who attended college with a group that had left school at or before high school graduation .\nBefore DACA , undocumented immigrants could not translate academic achievement into professional success\nPre-DACA , even those young adults who had attained advanced degrees found their work and life outcomes limited \u2014 and unusually similar to those of less-educated peers . Lacking Social Security numbers , driver \u2019 s licenses , and other credentials , college graduates found they had little choice but to enter the informal , low-wage labor market .\nIn 2011 , I sat across an auto assembly plant lunchroom table from Jonathan , who had not graduated from high school , and Ricardo , who had two postsecondary degrees . If Ricardo had been a citizen , he would have had his choice of attractive job possibilities , but both , now in their late twenties , faced the same limited work options .\nMany people I interviewed described chronic headaches , toothaches , ulcers , difficulty sleeping problems , eating disorders , and thoughts of suicide . They had grown up in communities around Los Angeles and ( as a result of the 1982 Supreme Court decision Plyler v. Doe , which opened the door to a K-12 education ) they had attended school alongside American-born and citizen peers .\nBut at a critical stage in their lives , their immigration status blocked important rites of passage \u2014 they couldn \u2019 t get getting driver \u2019 s licenses , after-school jobs , or financial aid for college . ( Many colleges would allow them to enroll , but they were disqualified from federal financial aid . )\nLife in the shadows enacts a heavy toll . In my book , using a term from sociology , I argued that illegality was a \u201c master status \u201d : a binding constraint that overwhelmed all other traits and achievements . It acted as a lead weight that eventually dragged them down .\nThe undocumented young adults in my study were the embodiment of Langston Hughes \u2019 s \u201c dream deferred . \u201d\nBut with DACA , things changed for many of these same people . In 2013 , my research team surveyed nearly 2,700 DACA-eligible young adults . Moreover , beginning in 2015 , we carried out two waves of in-depth , in-person interviews with 481 DACA beneficiaries in six states : Arizona , California , Georgia , Illinois , New York , and South Carolina .\nJust 16 months into the program , 59 percent of respondents reported having found a new job . Over one-fifth of the people we surveyed had obtained a paid internship .\nUndocumented immigrants aren \u2019 t forbidden from having credit cards or bank accounts , but having a Social Security number makes getting these financial tools a lot easier . Almost one-half of our survey respondents opened up their first bank account after receiving DACA , and a third acquired their first credit card . Close to 60 percent of our respondents had obtained a driver \u2019 s license .\nTwenty-one percent of those we surveyed reported that their access to health care had improved , sometimes because they had access to health plans provided by schools or employers .\nDACA \u2019 s benefits appear to be greatest for people with degrees from four-year colleges . They were more than 1.5 times as likely to obtain new jobs and increase their earnings than DACA beneficiaries who never went to college .

Six months ago , the political scientist Tom K.

More than half moved to a job that they thought better fit their education and training , or offered better working conditions .\nMuch of the political and media coverage of this group has focused on the academically gifted , but , in terms of distance traveled , DACA \u2019 s biggest success stories involve moderate achievers .
