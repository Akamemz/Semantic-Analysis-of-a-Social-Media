There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nRegarding Pelosi , \u201c [ her ] talents have always lain in the less glamorous , less public side of politics : she is good at whipping up votes in her caucus and she is good at disciplining dissenters . She is good at offering incentives and punishments to get Democratic members of Congress to do what she wants them to do\u2026 To rip up the speech on television was a bit of theatricality , sure \u2013 a ploy designed to get attention . It also worked . The day after Trump made a long speech full of misinformation that tried to make a case for his re-election , no one is talking about him . Instead we are talking about the speaker of the House . That , too , is a skill , one that Pelosi seems to be honing. \u201d Moira Donegan , The Guardian\nFinally , \u201c The Trump administration has long been hostile to foreign aid\u2026 The problem , however , is that this foreign aid funding isn \u2019 t just charity : Taking nearly $ 12 billion out of the foreign aid budget would severely harm US diplomatic efforts . For one , giving nations money they need to keep volatile situations stable enhances global security , and could actually prove cost-effective to the US if the money helps prevent catastrophe at home or abroad down the line\u2026 \u201c Aid could help with one of Trump \u2019 s top priorities : immigration . Trump last April froze $ 450 million in support to El Salvador , Guatemala , and Honduras . That took away needed direct support for people living in extreme poverty and danger in those nations , leading them to seek better opportunities in the United States\u2026 In years past , Republicans and Democrats have pushed back against these draconian slashes to foreign aid , and they are likely to do so again . But the president \u2019 s insistence on tearing down America \u2019 s assistance programs to bare bones \u2014 even though they hover at only around 1 percent of the federal budget \u2014 shows how misguided he is about their outsize impact. \u201d Alex Ward , Vox\n\u201c There are some other interesting bits in the new budget . In particular , it includes proposed efforts to bargain down drug prices \u2014 an unusual instance in which Trump would help out average Americans while forcing powerful pharmaceutical companies to eat the cost of the budget savings . But for the most part , the basic math of the budget emerges from the Republicans ' determination to protect their constituencies and primary ideological commitments \u2014 i.e . older voters , the wealthy , and the Pentagon \u2014 while foisting the costs of their extraordinarily ambitious deficit-reduction goals on everyone else. \u201d Jeff Spross , The Week\n\u201c The budget for the Health and Human Services Department would be lopped off by 9 % . Crucially , HHS includes the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Protection , the latter of which we \u2019 re hoping will help prevent the spread of the coronavirus , which has killed at least 910 people , a stat the World Health Organization has warned may just be the \u2018 tip of the iceberg. \u2019 ( Officials have claimed that funding aimed at combating the virus would be protected , but Trump has said a lot of things in the past that turned out to be lies . ) \u201d Bess Levin , Vanity Fair\n\u201c The shift of voters that drove the Democratic takeover of the House came after an outpouring of anger at Trump and Republicans over their effort to repeal the ACA . What \u2019 s more , in 2019 , Democrats won governor \u2019 s races in deep red Kentucky and Louisiana , and seized total control of Virginia state government , in no small part due to the Trump/GOP record on health care . Democrats won in part by advocating for the Medicaid expansion\u2026 \u201c It \u2019 s one of the stranger subplots of this presidency that Trump and Republicans keep gunning for health care , despite the deep unpopularity of those efforts\u2026 Trump is giving Democrats a big weapon to wield against him , and they should seize it , just as they did in 2018. \u201d Greg Sargent , Washington Post\n\u201c Recall [ Trump \u2019 s ] repeated promises not to \u2018 touch \u2019 Social Security and Medicare ? Even as the elderly population swells , his budget calls for removing half a trillion dollars of funding from the Medicare program over 10 years , including $ 135 billion from Medicare prescription drugs , and tens of billions from [ disability benefits provided by ] the Social Security program . In 2015 , he promised not to touch Medicaid , either . Now he wants to cut it by $ 920 billion\u2026 \u201c He was going to give Americans health care \u2018 much better \u2019 than Obamacare . But he has proposed no such thing and now his budget calls for cutting spending on the program by $ 844 billion\u2026 This budget is a clear articulation of what Trump would do if given the chance . Democrats should be shouting this warning from the mountaintops . Instead , they \u2019 re bickering over who has the purest form of Medicare-for-all. \u201d Dana Milbank , Washington Post\nThe right supports many parts of the budget , but argues that even deeper spending cuts are needed .\nThe right supports many parts of the budget , but argues that even deeper spending cuts are needed .\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s budget moves in the right direction by eliminating and cutting federal programs that perform functions that should be left to the people , states , and localities\u2026 Yet much more is needed to drain the swamp and limit Washington \u2019 s spending addiction\u2026\n\u201c Without spending restraint , low taxes are in immediate danger of being reversed . High deficits and debt also threaten economic progress , dragging down growth and putting the country at risk of a future fiscal crisis during which interest rates would rise , and the federal government would find it difficult to fund even core constitutional functions , such as providing for our nation \u2019 s defense .

This is close to the 2 % that NATO requires member countries to spend and not enough to replace the Pentagon \u2019 s aging weapons amid rising threats in multiple theaters\u2026\n\u201c The larger picture is that revenues have continued to rise despite the tax cut\u2026 The problem is that outlays are rising faster\u2014to 21.6 % of GDP this fiscal year , the most since 2012 and well above the Bush and late Clinton years . Democrats and their media friends are complaining that the Trump Administration still has no plans to balance the budget , but that will require addressing entitlements that are on autopilot . Neither Democrats nor Mr. Trump are offering to do that . \u201d\n\u201c Today \u2019 s deficits were pretty much baked into the cake long before Donald Trump entered the Oval Office\u2026 We \u2019 ve known for decades that due to the impending retirement of some 80 million baby boomers , the Titanic was headed toward [ a ] fiscal iceberg . Neither party did anything about it . The Trump strategy was to rapidly grow the economy and jobs so that more tax revenue would come into the government . That part has mostly worked\u2026\n\u201c Since we passed the Trump tax cuts at the end of 2017 , federal tax revenue is up from $ 3.316 trillion to $ 3.632 trillion \u2014 or $ 316 billion . The problem is federal spending has soared much faster , up by $ 665 billion in three years . Democrats want more for social programs . Republicans and Trump want more for the military , and so everything keeps rising . To rebalance the budget and contain our spiraling debt , a good first step is to recognize the problem : It \u2019 s the spending , stupid ! \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c President Trump is proposing to modify the outdated Institutions for Mental Disease payment exclusion , the long-standing Medicaid policy that prohibits federal reimbursement for many Medicaid-eligible patients who receive care in certain inpatient facilities dedicated to mental disease . These important changes will provide more than $ 5 billion in new federal funding to states that ensure a full continuum of care is in place to assist in getting people with serious mental illness the care they need and , in many cases , off the streets and out of prisons\u2026 Americans have failed people with mental illness . Trump \u2019 s new budget will change that . \u201d\nStill , \u201c Trump \u2019 s budget reflects the political reality that neither he nor congressional Republicans have the appetite for large-scale changes to entitlements along the lines of what was proposed by Paul Ryan . At the same time , they want to keep increasing military spending and , if anything , cut taxes further . Trying to narrow the deficit within these parameters requires substantial cuts to nondefense discretionary spending that are just as unlikely to be adopted and sustained by Congress as any serious reforms to entitlements\u2026 [ the budget is ] a demonstration of why the United States is fiscally doomed . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment .
