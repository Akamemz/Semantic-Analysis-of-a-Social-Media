    "content": "Image above : William Howard Taft and a succession of other Republican presidents privileged restoring relations with the South over protecting black Americans \u2019 rights . Joe Biden has fond memories of negotiating with James Eastland , the senator from Mississippi who once declared , \u201c I am of the opinion that we should have segregation in all the States of the United States by law . What the people of this country must realize is that the white race is a superior race , and the Negro race is an inferior race. \u201d To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . Recalling in June his debates with segregationists like Eastland , Biden lamented , \u201c At least there was some civility , \u201d compared with today . \u201c We got things done . We didn \u2019 t agree on much of anything . We got things done . We got it finished . But today , you look at the other side and you \u2019 re the enemy . Not the opposition ; the enemy . We don \u2019 t talk to each other anymore . \u201d\nBiden later apologized for his wistfulness . But yearning for an ostensibly more genteel era of American politics wasn \u2019 t a gaffe . Such nostalgia is central to Biden \u2019 s appeal as an antidote to the vitriol that has marked the presidency of Donald Trump . Nor is Biden alone in selling the idea that rancor threatens the American republic . This September , Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch , who owes his seat to Senate Republicans depriving a Democratic president of his authority to fill a vacancy on the high court , published a book that argued , \u201c In a very real way , self-governance turns on our treating each other as equals\u2014as persons , with the courtesy and respect each person deserves\u2014even when we vigorously disagree. \u201d Trump himself , a man whose rallies regularly descend into ritual denunciations of his enemies , declared in October 2018 , as Americans were preparing to vote in the midterm elections , that \u201c everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction. \u201d The president helpfully explained exactly what he meant : \u201c Constant unfair coverage , deep hostility , and negative attacks \u2026 only serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate. \u201d Civility , in other words , is treating Trump how Trump wants to be treated , while he treats you however he pleases . It was a more honest description of how the concept of civility is applied today than either Biden or Gorsuch offered .\nThere are two definitions of civility . The first is not being an asshole . The second is \u201c I can do what I want and you can shut up. \u201d The latter definition currently dominates American political discourse . The country is indeed divided today , and there is nothing wrong with wishing that Americans could all get along . But while nonviolence is essential to democracy , civility is optional , and today \u2019 s preoccupation with politesse both exaggerates the country \u2019 s divisions and papers over the fundamental issues that are causing the divisions in the first place . The idea that we \u2019 re currently experiencing something like the nadir of American civility ignores the turmoil that has traditionally characterized the nation \u2019 s politics , and the comparatively low level of political violence today despite the animosity of the moment . Americans should not fear tension . They should fear its absence . Paeans to a more civil past also ignore the price of that civility . It \u2019 s not an unfortunate coincidence that the men Joe Biden worked with so amicably were segregationists . The civility he longs for was the result of excluding historically marginalized groups from the polity , which allowed men like James Eastland to wield tremendous power in Congress without regard for the rights or dignity of their disenfranchised constituents . The true cause of American political discord is the lingering resistance of those who have traditionally held power to sharing it with those who until recently have only experienced its serrated edge . And the resistance does linger . Just this fall , a current Democratic senator from Delaware , Chris Coons , told a panel at the University of Notre Dame Law School that he hoped \u201c a more diverse Senate that includes women \u2019 s voices , and voices of people of color , and voices of people who were not professionals but , you know , who grew up working-class \u201d would not produce \u201c irreconcilable discord . \u201d\nIn his \u201c Letter From Birmingham Jail , \u201d Martin Luther King Jr. famously lamented the \u201c white moderate \u201d who \u201c prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice. \u201d He also acknowledged the importance of tension to achieving justice . \u201c I have earnestly opposed violent tension , \u201d King wrote , \u201c but there is a type of constructive , nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. \u201d Americans should not fear that form of tension . They should fear its absence . At their most frenzied , calls for civility stoke the fear that the United States might be on the precipice of armed conflict . Once confined to right-wing fever swamps , where radicals wrote fan fiction about taking up arms in response to \u201c liberal tyranny , \u201d the notion has gained currency in conservative media in the Trump era . In response to calls for gun-buyback programs , Tucker Carlson said on Fox News , \u201c What you are calling for is civil war. \u201d The president himself has warned that removing him from office , through the constitutionally provided-for mechanism of impeachment , might lead to civil war . Civil war is not an imminent prospect . The impulse to conjure its specter overlooks how bitter and fierce American politics has often been . In the early days of the republic , as Richard Hofstadter and Michael Wallace wrote in their 1970 book , American Violence , the country witnessed Election Day riots , in which \u201c one faction often tried violently to prevent another from voting. \u201d In the 1850s , the nativist Know-Nothings fielded gangs to intimidate immigrant voters . Abolitionists urged defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act , and lived by their words , running slave catchers out of town and breaking captured black people out of custody . Frederick Douglass said that the best way to make the act a \u201c dead letter \u201d was \u201c to make half a dozen or more dead kidnappers . \u201d\nDuring the Gilded Age , state militias turned guns on striking workers . From 1882 to 1968 , nearly 5,000 people , mostly black Americans , were lynched nationwide . From January 1969 to April 1970 , more than 4,000 bombings occurred across the country , according to a Senate investigation . As Hofstadter wrote , \u201c Violence has been used repeatedly in our past , often quite purposefully , and a full reckoning with the fact is a necessary ingredient in any realistic national self-image. \u201d The absence of this realistic national self-image has contributed to the sense of despair that characterizes American politics today . The reality , however , is that political violence is less common in the present than it has been at many points in American history , despite the ancient plague of white supremacy , the lingering scourge of jihadism , and the influence of a president who revels in winking justifications of violence against his political opponents and immigrants . Many Americans can \u2019 t stand one another right now . But apart from a few deranged fanatics , they do not want to slaughter one another en masse . The more pertinent historical analogue is not the fractious antebellum period right-wing partisans seem so eager to relive but the tragic failures of Reconstruction , when the comforts of comity were privileged over the difficult work of building a multiracial democracy . The danger of our own political moment is not that Americans will again descend into a bloody conflagration . It is that the fundamental rights of marginalized people will again become bargaining chips political leaders trade for an empty reconciliation . The Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution should have settled once and for all the question of whether America was a white man \u2019 s country or a nation for all its citizens . The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery , the Fourteenth Amendment established that anyone could be a citizen regardless of race , and the Fifteenth Amendment barred racial discrimination in voting . But by 1876 , Republicans had paid a high political price for their advocacy of rights for black people , losing control of the House and nearly losing the presidency to the party associated with a violent rebellion in defense of slavery . Democrats agreed to hand Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops in the South , effectively ending the region \u2019 s brief experiment in multiracial governance . Witnessing the first stirrings of reunion , Douglass , the great abolitionist , wondered aloud , \u201c In what position will this stupendous reconciliation leave the colored people ? \u201d He was right to worry .\nOne state government after another fell to campaigns of murder and terror carried out by Democratic paramilitaries . With its black constituency in the South disempowered , the Republican Party grew reliant on its corporate patrons , and adjusted its approach to maximize support from white voters . As for those emancipated after a devastating war , the party of abolition abandoned them to the despotism of their former masters . Writing in 1902 , the political scientist and white supremacist John W. Burgess observed , \u201c The white men of the South need now have no further fear that the Republican party , or Republican Administrations , will ever again give themselves over to the vain imagination of the political equality of man. \u201d The capitulation of Republicans restored civility between the major parties , but the political truce masked a horrendous spike in violence against freedmen . \u201c While the parties clearly move back from confrontation with each other , you have the unleashing of massive white-supremacist violence in the South against African Americans and a systematic campaign to disenfranchise , a systematic campaign of racial terror in the South , \u201d Manisha Sinha , a history professor at the University of Connecticut and the author of The Slave \u2019 s Cause : A History of Abolition , told me . \u201c This is an era when white supremacy becomes virtually a national ideology. \u201d This was the fruit of prizing reconciliation over justice , order over equality , civility over truth . Republicans \u2019 acquiescence laid the foundation for the reimposition of forced labor on the emancipated , the establishment of the Jim Crow system , and the state and extrajudicial terror that preserved white supremacy in the South for another century .\nThe day William Howard Taft was inaugurated , in March 1909 , was frigid\u2014a storm dropped more than half a foot of snow on Washington , D.C . But Taft \u2019 s inaugural address was filled with warm feeling , particularly about the reconciliation of North and South , and the full and just resolution of what was then known as the \u201c Negro problem. \u201d \u201c I look forward , \u201d the party of Lincoln \u2019 s latest president said , \u201c to an increased feeling on the part of all the people in the South that this Government is their Government , and that its officers in their states are their officers. \u201d He assured Americans , \u201c I have not the slightest race prejudice or feeling , and recognition of its existence only awakens in my heart a deeper sympathy for those who have to bear it or suffer from it , and I question the wisdom of a policy which is likely to increase it. \u201d To that end , he explained , black people should abandon their ambitions toward enfranchisement . In fact , Taft praised the various measures white Southerners had devised to exclude poor white and black Americans\u2014 \u201c an ignorant , irresponsible element \u201d \u2014from the polity . Writing in The Crisis two years later , W. E. B . Du Bois bitterly described Taft \u2019 s betrayal of black Americans . \u201c In the face of a record of murder , lynching and burning in this country which has appalled the civilized world and loosened the tongue of many a man long since dumb on the race problem , in spite of this , Mr. Taft has blandly informed a deputation of colored men that any action on his part is quite outside his power , if not his interest . \u201d\nThe first volume of David Levering Lewis \u2019 s biography of Du Bois shows him in particular anguish over what he called the \u201c Taft Doctrine \u201d of acquiescence to Jim Crow , which , in Lewis \u2019 s words , \u201c had virtually nullified what remained of Republican Party interest in civil rights. \u201d Taft \u2019 s Republican successors generally followed suit , culminating in Herbert Hoover , who in 1928 \u201c accelerated the policy of whitening the GOP below the Mason-Dixon Line in order to bring about a major political realignment , \u201d as Lewis put it in the second volume of his Du Bois biography . Taft , who was now the chief justice of the Supreme Court , described the strategy as an attempt \u201c to break up the solid South and to drive the Negroes out of Republican politics . \u201d\nTaft couldn \u2019 t have predicted exactly how this realignment would take place , but he was right about the result . Despite the best efforts of Southern Democrats to segregate the benefits of the New Deal , the policies devised by Franklin D. Roosevelt to lift America out of the Great Depression alleviated black poverty , reinvigorating black participation in politics and helping transform the Democratic Party . \u201c Government became immediate , its impact tangible , its activities relevant , \u201d wrote the historian Nancy Weiss Malkiel in her 1983 book , Farewell to the Party of Lincoln . \u201c As a result , blacks , like other Americans , found themselves drawn into the political process . \u201d\nThe New Deal \u2019 s modest , albeit inadvertent , erosion of racial apartheid turned Southern Democrats against it . Thus began a period of ideological heterodoxy within the parties born of the unresolved race question . Whatever their other differences , significant factions in both parties could agree on the imperative to further marginalize black Americans . Some of the worst violence in American history occurred during the period of low partisan polarization stretching from the late Progressive era to the late 1970s\u2014the moment for which Joe Biden waxed nostalgic . In Ivy League debate rooms and the Senate cloakroom , white men could discuss the most divisive issues of the day with all the politeness befitting what was for them a low-stakes conflict . Outside , the people whose rights were actually at stake were fighting and dying to have those rights recognized . In 1955 , the lynching of Emmett Till\u2014and the sight of his mutilated body in his casket\u2014helped spark the modern civil-rights movement . Lionized today for their disciplined , nonviolent protest , civil-rights demonstrators were seen by American political elites as unruly and impolite . In April 1965 , about a month after police attacked civil-rights marchers in Selma , Alabama , with billy clubs and tear gas , National Review published a cover story opposing the Voting Rights Act . Titled \u201c Must We Repeal the Constitution to Give the Negro the Vote ? , \u201d the article , written by James Jackson Kilpatrick , began by lamenting the uncompromising meanness of the law \u2019 s supporters . Opposing the enfranchisement of black people , Kilpatrick complained , meant being dismissed as \u201c a bigot , a racist , a violator of the rights of man , a mute accomplice to the murder of a mother-of-five . \u201d\nThe fact that National Review \u2019 s founder , William F. Buckley Jr. , had editorialized that \u201c the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail , politically and culturally , in areas in which it does not predominate numerically \u201d went unmentioned by Kilpatrick . Both civility and democracy were marred by the inclusion of black people in politics because in the view of Kilpatrick , Buckley , and many of their contemporaries , black people had no business participating in the first place . Since the 1970s , American politics has grown more polarized , as the realignment Taft foresaw moved toward its conclusion and the parties became more ideologically distinct . In recent years , the differences between Republicans and Democrats have come to be defined as much by identity as by ideology . If you are white and Christian , you are very likely to be a Republican ; if you are not , you are more likely to be a Democrat . At the same time , Americans have now sorted themselves geographically and socially such that they rarely encounter people who hold opposing views . It \u2019 s a recipe for acrimony . As the parties become more homogeneous and more alien to each other , \u201c we are more capable of dehumanizing the other side or distancing ourselves from them on a moral basis , \u201d Lilliana Mason , a political scientist and the author of Uncivil Agreement , told me . \u201c So it becomes easier for us to say things like \u2018 People on the other side are not just wrong ; they \u2019 re evil \u2019 or \u2018 People on the other side , they should be treated like animals . \u2019 \u201d\nIdeological and demographic uniformity has not been realized equally in both parties , however . The Democratic Party remains a heterogeneous entity , full of believers and atheists , nurses and college professors , black people and white people . This has made the party more hospitable to multiracial democracy . The end of polarization in America matters less than the terms on which it ends . The Republican Party , by contrast , has grown more racially and religiously homogeneous , and its politics more dependent on manufacturing threats to the status of white Christians . This is why Trump frequently and falsely implies that Americans were afraid to say \u201c Merry Christmas \u201d before he was elected , and why Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham warn Fox News viewers that nonwhite immigrants are stealing America . For both the Republican Party and conservative media , wielding power and influence depends on making white Americans feel threatened by the growing political influence of those who are different from them . In stoking such fears , anger is a powerful weapon . In his book Anger and Racial Politics , the University of Maryland professor Antoine J . Banks argues that \u201c anger is the dominant emotional underpinning of contemporary racism. \u201d Anger and racism are so linked , in fact , that politicians need not use overtly racist language to provoke racial resentment . Anger alone , Banks writes , can activate prejudiced views , even when a given issue would seem to have little to do with race : \u201c Anger operates as a switch that amplifies ( or turns on ) racist thinking\u2014exacerbating America \u2019 s racial problem . It pushes prejudiced whites to oppose policies and candidates perceived as alleviating racial inequality. \u201d This is true for politicians on both sides of the political divide\u2014but the right has far more to gain from sowing discord than from mending fences .\nTrumpists lamenting civility \u2019 s decline do not fear fractiousness ; on the contrary , they happily practice it to their own ends . What they really fear is the cultural , political , and economic shifts that occur when historically marginalized groups begin to exert power in a system that was once defined by their exclusion . Social mores that had been acceptable become offensive ; attitudes that had been widely held are condemned . Whether the American political system today can endure without fracturing further may depend on the choices of the center-right , Yoni Appelbaum writes . Societies are constantly renegotiating the boundaries of respect and decency . This process can be disorienting ; to the once dominant group , it can even feel like oppression . ( It is not . ) Many of the same people who extol the sanctity of civility when their prerogatives are questioned are prone to convulsions over the possibility of respecting those they consider beneath them , a form of civility they deride as \u201c political correctness. \u201d In a different political system , the tide would pull the Republican Party toward the center . But the GOP \u2019 s structural advantage in the Electoral College and the Senate , and its success in gerrymandering congressional and state legislative districts all over the country , allow it to wield power while continuing to appeal solely to a diminishing conservative minority encouraged to regard its fellow Americans as an existential threat . Related Stories White Nationalism \u2019 s Deep American Roots\nWhat Americans Do Now Will Define Us Forever The Trump administration \u2019 s attempt to use the census to enhance the power of white voters was foiled by a single vote on the Supreme Court on the basis of a technicality ; it will not be the last time this incarnation of the Republican Party seeks to rig democracy to its advantage on racial terms . Even before Trump , the party was focused not only on maximizing the influence of white voters but on disenfranchising minority voters , barely bothering to update its rationale since Taft praised Jim Crow\u2013era voting restrictions for banishing the \u201c ignorant \u201d from the polity .",

Du Bois bitterly described Taft\u2019s betrayal of black Americans. \u201cIn the face of a record of murder, lynching and burning in this country which has appalled the civilized world and loosened the tongue of many a man long since dumb on the race problem, in spite of this, Mr. Taft has blandly informed a deputation of colored men that any action on his part is quite outside his power, if not his interest.\u201d\n\nThe first volume of David Levering Lewis\u2019s biography of Du Bois shows him in particular anguish over what he called the \u201cTaft Doctrine\u201d of acquiescence to Jim Crow, which, in Lewis\u2019s words, \u201chad virtually nullified what remained of Republican Party interest in civil rights.\u201d Taft\u2019s Republican successors generally followed suit, culminating in Herbert Hoover, who in 1928 \u201caccelerated the policy of whitening the GOP below the Mason-Dixon Line in order to bring about a major political realignment,\u201d as Lewis put it in the second volume of his Du Bois biography. Taft, who was now the chief justice of the Supreme Court, described the strategy as an attempt \u201cto break up the solid South and to drive the Negroes out of Republican politics.\u201d\n\nTaft couldn\u2019t have predicted exactly how this realignment would take place, but he was right about the result. Despite the best efforts of Southern Democrats to segregate the benefits of the New Deal, the policies devised by Franklin D. Roosevelt to lift America out of the Great Depression alleviated black poverty, reinvigorating black participation in politics and helping transform the Democratic Party. \u201cGovernment became immediate, its impact tangible, its activities relevant,\u201d wrote the historian Nancy Weiss Malkiel in her 1983 book, Farewell to the Party of Lincoln. \u201cAs a result, blacks, like other Americans, found themselves drawn into the political process.\u201d\n\nThe New Deal\u2019s modest, albeit inadvertent, erosion of racial apartheid turned Southern Democrats against it. Thus began a period of ideological heterodoxy within the parties born of the unresolved race question. Whatever their other differences, significant factions in both parties could agree on the imperative to further marginalize black Americans. Some of the worst violence in American history occurred during the period of low partisan polarization stretching from the late Progressive era to the late 1970s\u2014the moment for which Joe Biden waxed nostalgic. In Ivy League debate rooms and the Senate cloakroom, white men could discuss the most divisive issues of the day with all the politeness befitting what was for them a low-stakes conflict. Outside, the people whose rights were actually at stake were fighting and dying to have those rights recognized. In 1955, the lynching of Emmett Till\u2014and the sight of his mutilated body in his casket\u2014helped spark the modern civil-rights movement. Lionized today for their disciplined, nonviolent protest, civil-rights demonstrators were seen by American political elites as unruly and impolite. In April 1965, about a month after police attacked civil-rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, with billy clubs and tear gas, National Review published a cover story opposing the Voting Rights Act. Titled \u201cMust We Repeal the Constitution to Give the Negro the Vote?,\u201d the article, written by James Jackson Kilpatrick, began by lamenting the uncompromising meanness of the law\u2019s supporters. Opposing the enfranchisement of black people, Kilpatrick complained, meant being dismissed as \u201ca bigot, a racist, a violator of the rights of man, a mute accomplice to the murder of a mother-of-five.\u201d\n\nThe fact that National Review\u2019s founder, William F. Buckley Jr., had editorialized that \u201cthe White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not predominate numerically\u201d went unmentioned by Kilpatrick. Both civility and democracy were marred by the inclusion of black people in politics because in the view of Kilpatrick, Buckley, and many of their contemporaries, black people had no business participating in the first place. Since the 1970s, American politics has grown more polarized, as the realignment Taft foresaw moved toward its conclusion and the parties became more ideologically distinct. In recent years, the differences between Republicans and Democrats have come to be defined as much by identity as by ideology. If you are white and Christian, you are very likely to be a Republican; if you are not, you are more likely to be a Democrat. At the same time, Americans have now sorted themselves geographically and socially such that they rarely encounter people who hold opposing views. It\u2019s a recipe for acrimony. As the parties become more homogeneous and more alien to each other, \u201cwe are more capable of dehumanizing the other side or distancing ourselves from them on a moral basis,\u201d Lilliana Mason, a political scientist and the author of Uncivil Agreement, told me. \u201cSo it becomes easier for us to say things like \u2018People on the other side are not just wrong; they\u2019re evil\u2019 or \u2018People on the other side, they should be treated like animals.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIdeological and demographic uniformity has not been realized equally in both parties, however. The Democratic Party remains a heterogeneous entity, full of believers and atheists, nurses and college professors, black people and white people. This has made the party more hospitable to multiracial democracy. The end of polarization in America matters less than the terms on which it ends. The Republican Party, by contrast, has grown more racially and religiously homogeneous, and its politics more dependent on manufacturing threats to the status of white Christians. This is why Trump frequently and falsely implies that Americans were afraid to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d before he was elected, and why Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham warn Fox News viewers that nonwhite immigrants are stealing America. For both the Republican Party and conservative media, wielding power and influence depends on making white Americans feel threatened by the growing political influence of those who are different from them. In stoking such fears, anger is a powerful weapon. In his book Anger and Racial Politics, the University of Maryland professor Antoine J. Banks argues that \u201canger is the dominant emotional underpinning of contemporary racism.\u201d Anger and racism are so linked, in fact, that politicians need not use overtly racist language to provoke racial resentment. Anger alone, Banks writes, can activate prejudiced views, even when a given issue would seem to have little to do with race: \u201cAnger operates as a switch that amplifies (or turns on) racist thinking\u2014exacerbating America\u2019s racial problem. It pushes prejudiced whites to oppose policies and candidates perceived as alleviating racial inequality.\u201d This is true for politicians on both sides of the political divide\u2014but the right has far more to gain from sowing discord than from mending fences.\n\nTrumpists lamenting civility\u2019s decline do not fear fractiousness; on the contrary, they happily practice it to their own ends. What they really fear is the cultural, political, and economic shifts that occur when historically marginalized groups begin to exert power in a system that was once defined by their exclusion. Social mores that had been acceptable become offensive; attitudes that had been widely held are condemned. Whether the American political system today can endure without fracturing further may depend on the choices of the center-right, Yoni Appelbaum writes. Societies are constantly renegotiating the boundaries of respect and decency. This process can be disorienting; to the once dominant group, it can even feel like oppression. (It is not.) Many of the same people who extol the sanctity of civility when their prerogatives are questioned are prone to convulsions over the possibility of respecting those they consider beneath them, a form of civility they deride as \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d In a different political system, the tide would pull the Republican Party toward the center. But the GOP\u2019s structural advantage in the Electoral College and the Senate, and its success in gerrymandering congressional and state legislative districts all over the country, allow it to wield power while continuing to appeal solely to a diminishing conservative minority encouraged to regard its fellow Americans as an existential threat.
