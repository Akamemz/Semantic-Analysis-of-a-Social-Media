On Sunday , Obama aides said Obama 's subdued , languid performance two weeks ago would be replaced by a candidate intent on calling out what he sees as inconsistencies and straight-up lies from his opponent .\n`` He knew when he walked off that stage ( of the first debate ) , and he also knew as he watched the tape of that debate , that he has to be more energetic , '' Robert Gibbs , an Obama campaign adviser and former White House press secretary , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union .

''\nRomney adviser Ed Gillespie , also speaking on `` State of the Union , '' said a shift in style would n't win Obama any points from an electorate looking at the past four years .\n`` The president can change his style . He can change his tactics . He ca n't change his record . He ca n't change his policies . That 's what this election is about , '' Gillespie said .\nSen . Rob Portman , who is playing Obama in Romney 's debate rehearsals , said the Republican team was ready and expecting Obama to take a more aggressive stance Tuesday .\n`` I think President Obama is going to come out swinging , '' Portman said on ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` He 's going to compensate for a poor first debate . And I think that will be consistent with what they 've been doing this whole campaign , which is running a highly negative ad campaign . They 've spent hundreds of millions around the country , including a lot in Ohio , mischaracterizing Gov . Romney 's positions and misrepresenting him . I think you 'll see that again on Tuesday night . ''\nFor Obama , some of that newfound aggression could come from a series of campaign attacks that went unused in his first showdown with Romney , including bringing up Romney 's remark that 47 % of Americans are dependent on government support and his tenure as chief executive of Bain Capital , a private equity firm .\nRomney 's personal income tax returns could also surface during Tuesday 's debate . Obama 's campaign released a television spot on Friday casting the 14 % effective rate Romney paid in 2011 as unfairly low for a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars .\nAll of those topics are part of Obama 's regular stump speech , and many Democrats were puzzled and upset that Obama did not mention them during the first debate , leaving him exposed to attacks from Romney without using any of his own trail-tested retorts .\nUnlike Obama , Vice President Joe Biden used the `` 47 % '' remark to chastise Romney during his debate with the GOP nominee 's running mate , Paul Ryan , saying Romney 's opposition to the auto industry bailout was reflected in the Republican 's comments .\nGibbs and Axelrod foreshadowed a president more intent on fact-checking Romney in Tuesday 's debate . In the days following the first showdown , Obama slammed Romney at campaign rallies as being dishonest about his record and proposals , though he did not make those claims during the debate itself .\n`` If Mitt Romney puts up his hands and says , ' I do n't have a $ 5 trillion tax cut , I do n't want to cut taxes on the very wealthy , ' absolutely -- I think the president will walk through for voters in that room , that are going to be undecided , exactly what the Romney campaign wants to do and why it 's bad for this country , '' Gibbs said .\nThe town hall setup of the debate , which will give Obama and Romney the chance to speak to both the moderator and undecided voters , could prove to be a barrier to a full-scale assault on Romney 's record , however . Strategists say that debate style requires a degree of likability from a candidate that is difficult to square with negative attacks .\n`` It requires very good interaction with those people and the ability to be able to connect . You have to be able to come across as very likable in a town hall , '' Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said , adding that one of Obama 's strengths is his ability to communicate with average people .\nComing across as likable -- while at the same time aggressively fact-checking his opponent -- could prove a challenge for the Democratic incumbent . Both Romney and Obama rarely narrate their own negative television ads , leaving the so-called `` contrast '' commercials to narrators .\nAnd while both Obama and Romney can be aggressively negative at campaign rallies , they are not facing direct questions from voters in those settings .\nThe new debate setup led both candidates to skip any campaigning Sunday to spend time on debate preparations , Romney at his home in Massachusetts and Obama at a golf resort fronting the James River in Williamsburg , Virginia .\nOne advantage for the president may be lowered expectations after a maligned first debate , putting him in a position where even a modest improvement will be seen as a victory . The candidates will also be in a setting that even Republicans concede is not Romney 's wheelhouse .\n`` One of his big challenges during this entire campaign has been not being able to connect with the common man , woman , and child , '' Navarro said . `` He 's got to be able to come across as connecting , he 's got to come across as genuine , as caring , as likable . I think we 've seen a lot more of that from Mitt Romney in the last few days on the campaign . ''\nMaria Cardona , a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor , said the setting plays to Obama 's strengths .\n`` He will absolutely be able to draw from the energy of the public and the crowd , which we know he can really draw on so well . And I think also it will enable him to use a lot of the personal stories that he is so good at using on the stump , '' she said .\nAs Obama 's surrogates on Sunday were previewing a shift to a more robust style , Romney 's advisers were foreshadowing a foreign policy argument against the administration . Republicans have seized upon Biden 's comments at last week 's vice-presidential debate denying knowledge of requests for increased security at an American diplomatic post in Benghazi , Libya , ahead of the deadly attack there in September .\n`` Vice President Biden directly contradicted the sworn testimony of the State Department in the debate the other night . That led to another round of kind of nuancing by the White House , '' Gillespie said , adding : `` There are inconsistencies here , and I think as Americans we deserve to know what really happened going into this attack . ''\nGibbs rejected the criticism , calling Republicans who disparage the White House response `` wing-tipped cowboys '' engaged in `` shoot-from-the-hip diplomacy . ''\nThe town hall-style debate Tuesday will focus on both domestic and foreign policy issues , making it likely the Libya issue will arise during questioning from the audience of undecided voters .",
