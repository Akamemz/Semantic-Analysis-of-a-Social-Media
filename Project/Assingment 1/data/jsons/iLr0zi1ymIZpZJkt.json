On May 27 , the University of Minnesota\u2013Twin Cities announced that it would be severely limiting its contact with the MPD and would no longer have police work security at football games and concerts .

Current Issue View our current issue\nIn K-12 schools , increased police presence on campus has been linked to the school-to-prison-pipeline , a disturbing trend where children in low-income and heavily policed public schools that use a \u201c zero-tolerance \u201d punitive policy are funneled into juvenile detention centers at rapid rates . For this reason , many educational experts believe that reducing the police presence on campus will also reduce crime .\n\u201c In recent years the school-to-prison pipeline has been expanding because schools are installing things like metal detectors and broadening relationships with cops , \u201d K Agbebiyi , a social worker and abolitionist organizer based in New York , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c This leads to kids being funneled into the system a lot more rapidly , and affects black and low income students the most . \u201d\nIn Minneapolis , many students feel that removing police from the campus will make them feel more safe . Nathaniel Greene , a black junior at Washburn High School and a student representative on the Minneapolis Board of Education , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that students in the city have been advocating the removal of police for many years and were instrumental in the district \u2019 s recent successes . Greene said he \u2019 s very glad that his school will be removing Student Resource Officers ( SROs ) , sworn law enforcement officers that act as security guards on campus .\n\u201c I just can \u2019 t imagine a positive school climate with SROs in it at any school in the district , but especially in Minneapolis , \u201d Greene said . \u201c In the three months we \u2019 ve been out of school , students have been pepper-sprayed and teargassed by the police or have seen the National Guard or the KKK rolling down their neighborhood .
