On Monday, he made good on his campaign promise.\n\nFirst, the science: The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) own computer model easily shows that President Obama\u2019s proposed regulations would reduce global warming by around 0.02 of a degree Celsius by the year 2100. Actually, the true number is probably even smaller because that calculation assumes a future rate of warming \u2014 there hasn\u2019t been any for 17 years now \u2014 quite a bit higher than it is likely to be.\n\nNow, the process: People will ask where the president was granted such power to do this without the explicit consent of the Congress. The answer lies in the mirror. We, the people, elected a Congress that, in 1990, passed a massive amendment to the existing Clean Air Act that barely mentioned carbon dioxide. Only a few green lobbyists probably knew that it was buried in the text. In 2007, the Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision that the act indeed gave the president the power to regulate carbon dioxide.\n\nThe court held that the president could only do this if an appropriate federal agency found that it \u201cendangered\u201d human health and welfare. The Bush administration sat on its hands, but the Obama clan had a preliminary finding on said endangerment 90 days after he took the oath of office.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter that the EPA\u2019s basis for finding \u201cendangerment\u201d was pretty cheesy and easy to tear apart. As a rule, the courts don\u2019t like to mess with technical decisions made by Washington regulators, so the EPA in 2009 granted the president authority to do precisely what he did Monday morning. And more.\n\nNow, the impact: Having established that Monday\u2019s action will do nothing about global warming, and that it was apparently quite legal, we can also be pretty confident that the coal industry of West Virginia, Southwest Virginia and eastern Kentucky \u2014 where much of the stuff that power plants burn comes from \u2014 has been dealt a very serious blow.\n\nYou might say: So what?
