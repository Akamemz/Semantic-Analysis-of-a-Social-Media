And that is the concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way .\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder stated that the Garner and Michael Brown cases will be investigated by the Department of Justice .\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand : \u201c The death of Eric Garner is a tragedy that demands accountability . Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses . \u201d\nNY Gov . Andrew Cuomo : \u201c The circumstances surrounding his death were nothing short of tragic . And while there will be people who disagree with today \u2019 s grand jury decision , it is important that we respect the legal process and rule of law , \u201d he said in a statement . \u201c At the same time , the justice system also allows for additional investigations and reviews , and it may be appropriate for the federal government to do so in this case . And if there are improvements to be made and lessons to be learned , we at the state level are ready to act to better the system . \u201d\nHis death was a terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure .

He was surrounded by policemen . No one else touched him . And the grand jury did not say that he committed suicide . They didn \u2019 t say what happened . That \u2019 s why it \u2019 s important that the district attorney has an obligation to bring the facts to New York and the American people to see how they could have possibly stretched their imagination to reach that decision .\nWe saw a video of an officer performing a prohibited chokehold , a chokehold that is prohibited by NYPD policy and has been for a couple of decades now . I just don \u2019 t see how you put the video together , you put the coroner \u2019 s report together , and you don \u2019 t get one of those two charges , ( second degree manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide ) at least as a charge to go to a trial and have a jury ultimately decide guilty or innocence .\nOf course , the Rev . Al Sharpton had a lot to say\nA national march will be held in Washington , D.C. on December 13 to halt police brutality and ask that the DOJ to prosecute NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo , the officer in the Garner case . The grand jury process can not be trusted . Sharpton \u2019 s National Action Network will meet with the National Urban League , the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and the Black Women \u2019 s Roundtable on Thursday in New York City to discuss further action .\nNo amount of secret grand juries with local prosecutors that put up evidence that we do not know is going to stop people from raising the questions and demanding the answers \u2026 It is time for a national march to deal with a national crisis . Why a national march ? Because we can not be put around like social hamsters \u2013 one minute Ferguson , next minute New York , next minute Cleveland .

The time for remorse would have been when my husband was screaming to breathe . That would have been the time for him to show some type of remorse or some type of care for another human being \u2019 s life , when he was screaming 11 times that he can \u2019 t breathe .
