    "content": "A perjury investigation could be the next hurdle faced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions , with Democrats and civil liberties groups unimpressed by his decision to recuse himself from any investigations involving the presidential campaigns .\nBut the question of whether the attorney general committed perjury when he denied during his Senate confirmation hearing that he had contact with any Russian officials during the course of the Trump campaign is a tricky one , according to legal analysts who raised doubts about the potential for any such charges to stick .\nMr . Sessions , an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign , announced his plan Thursday to recuse himself \u201c from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaign for president of the United States . \u201d\nBut he also addressed his failure to disclose his two meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak when he was questioned by Sen. Al Franken , Minnesota Democrat , during his confirmation hearing , saying that he felt his response \u201c was honest and correct as I understood it at the time . \u201d\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she was unimpressed by Mr. Sessions \u2019 \u201c narrow recusal and his sorry attempt to explain away his perjury . \u201d\n\u201c He is clearly trying to maintain his ability to control the larger investigation into the sprawling personal , political and financial grip Russia has on the Trump administration , \u201d the California Democrat said . \u201c Attorney General Sessions \u2019 lies to the Senate and to the American people make him unfit to serve as the chief law enforcement officer of our country . He must resign immediately . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Trump tweets support of Jeff Sessions , blames Democratic partisanship\nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee wrote to FBI Director James B. Comey and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on Thursday to ask them to launch a criminal investigation into whether Mr. Sessions \u2019 statements violated laws regarding perjury and lying to Congress .\nBut legal statutes make it difficult to pursue and prove perjury claims , leaving some legal analysts to say that calls for the attorney general \u2019 s resignation based on his omitted disclosures to Congress are premature and overblown .\n\u201c It is certainly reasonable to open an investigation just on the surface of the comments , but perjury is impacted by intent , and there is room to argue he had no intent to lie because he was hyperfocused on what the question was , \u201d said Mark S. Zaid , a Washington lawyer specializing in government accountability .\n\u201c Meaning when asked about contacts with the Russians , was he thinking of his role solely as a surrogate for the Trump team or in his capacity as a U.S. senator on the Armed Services Committee ? These cases are very difficult , \u201d Mr. Zaid explained .\nDuring the confirmation hearing , Mr. Franken asked Mr . Sessions , \u201c If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign , what will you do ? \u201d\nMr . Sessions replied that he was \u201c not aware of any of those activities . \u201d\n\u201c I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign , and I didn \u2019 t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians , and I \u2019 m unable to comment on it , \u201d he said at the time .\nOn Thursday Mr . Sessions said he was taken aback by Mr. Franken \u2019 s question and did not intend to give false information .\n\u201c I was taken back a little bit about this new information , this allegation that surrogates , and I had been called a surrogate for Donald Trump \u2014 had been meeting continuously with Russian officials , \u201d Mr . Sessions said . \u201c That struck me very hard , and that is what I focused my answer on . In retrospect , I should have slowed down and said , \u2018 But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times \u2014 that would be the ambassador. \u2019 \u201c\nDescribing the elements required for an action to be considered perjury , Robert Barnes , a California-based trial attorney whose practice focuses on tax , civil rights and First Amendment law , said that it \u2019 s clear Mr . Sessions did not perjure himself during the hearing .\n\u201c Anyone reading the actual exchange can see Sessions was referring to no communications \u2018 as a surrogate \u2019 just as the question \u2019 s very long preamble specifically referenced the focus of the question to that subject matter , \u201d wrote Mr. Barnes in an op-ed published by Law Newz . \u201c Nothing about Sessions \u2019 answer was false , nor could it be construed to be materially false or willfully false , or even false at all . \u201d\nU.S. attorney guidelines on general perjury statute 18 U.S.C . 1621 state that \u201c the government must demonstrate the defendant voluntarily made the false statement with knowledge of its falsity . If the defendant believed his or her statement to be true when it was made , even though it was false , this essential element will not have been proven . \u201d\nDespite the difficulties in pursuing such a charge , American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said Thursday that there must be an investigation into whether or not Mr . Sessions committed perjury .\n\u201c If senators of both parties allow an attorney general nominee to plainly lie under oath with no repercussions , they will render our government \u2019 s cabinet confirmation process no more than kabuki theater , \u201d Mr. Romero said in a statement issued ahead of the attorney general \u2019 s new conference .\n\u201c The American people deserve a full investigation into whether Sessions perjured himself and if he is indeed fit to serve as our nation \u2019 s highest law enforcement official . No one is above the law \u2014 certainly not those sworn to uphold it , \u201d he said .\nBut David K. Rehr , a professor at George Mason University \u2019 s Antonin Scalia Law School , characterized calls for further investigation and perjury charges as simply a partisan frenzy .\n\u201c My own view is that the president \u2019 s opponents are looking for every device possible to prevent him from enacting his agenda \u2014 and I think this is part of it , \u201d Mr. Rehr said . \u201c Had the national security people who worked for President Obama known that the Russians were involved in the election , they would have released specific items and allegations before the election .
