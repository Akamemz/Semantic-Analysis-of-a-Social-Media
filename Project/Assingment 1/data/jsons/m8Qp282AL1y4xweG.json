    "content": "I \u2019 ve been studying the history of American conservatism full time since 1997\u2014almost 20 years now . I \u2019 ve read almost every major book on the subject . I thought I knew what I was talking about . Then along comes Donald Trump to scramble the whole goddamned script .\nNow , historians must begin to consider alternate genealogies of the American right : lineages for the orange-haired monster that no one saw coming . Our received narrative of the movement encompassed by Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckley and Strom Thurmond and Milton Friedman and Ronald Reagan just doesn \u2019 t cut it any longer . I \u2019 ve done my best to begin the work\u2014thinking through , for instance , Trumpism \u2019 s connection to fascism , a political tradition not heretofore considered all that relevant in the American context . Other bodies , however , are buried closer to home .\nNo history of modern conservatism I \u2019 m aware of finds much significance in the 22,000 Nazi sympathizers who rallied for Hitler at Madison Square Garden in February 1939 , presided over by a giant banner of General George Washington that stretched almost all the way to the second deck , capped off by a menacing eagle insignia . Nor the now-infamous Ku Klux Klan march through the streets of Queens in 1927 , when The New York Times reported \u201c 1,000 Klansmen and 100 policemen staged a free-for-all , \u201d in which according to one contemporary news report all the individuals arrested were wearing Klan attire , and that one of those arrestees was Donald Trump \u2019 s own father .\nIn the specter of the son \u2019 s likely ascension as Republican nominee , however , such events gather significance . Consider the subsequent history of Fred Trump \u2019 s career as a developer of middle-class housing in the outer boroughs of New York City . We now know Fred Trump was notorious enough a racist to draw the attention of Woody Guthrie , who wrote a song about him in the 1950s : \u201c I suppose/ Old Man Trump knows/ Just how much/ Racial Hate/ he stirred up/ In the bloodpot of human hearts/ When he drawed/ That color line/ Here at his/ Eighteen hundred family project . \u201d\nTwenty years later\u2014by which time he had brought his son in as his apprentice\u2014the hate Old Man Trump stirred in the bloodpot of human hearts became a matter of legal record , when the United States Justice Department sued Trump p\u00e8re et fils for violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968 in operating 39 buildings they owned . Testifying in his own defense , young Donald ( who would soon be seen around town in a chauffeured limousine with a license plate reading \u201c DJT \u201d ) , testified that he was \u201c unfamiliar \u201d with the landmark law . As the evidence in the federal case against the Trump organization became close to incontrovertible , he told the press the suit was a conspiracy to force them \u201c to rent to welfare recipients , \u201d a form of \u201c reverse discrimination. \u201d This proud and open refusal to rent to welfare recipients\u2014whom he said contribute to \u201c the detriment of tenants who have , for many years , lived in these buildings , raised families in them , and who plan to live there \u201d \u2014was Donald Trump \u2019 s defense against racism .\nIt is in this saga that we locate the formation of Donald Trump \u2019 s mature political vision of the world , in continuity with America \u2019 s racist and nativist heyday of the 1920s , and within the context of a cultural world much more familiar to us : New York in the 1970s , that raging cauldron of skyrocketing violent crime , subway trains slathered with graffiti , and a fiscal crisis so dire that even police were laid off in mass\u2014then the laid off cops blocked the Brooklyn Bridge , deflating car tires , and yanking keys from car ignitions .\nThink of Trump coming of age in the New York of the 1977 blackout , the search for the Son of Sam , and Howard Cosell barking out \u201c Ladies and gentlemen , the Bronx is burning \u201d during game two of the World Series at Yankee stadium as a helicopter hovered over a five-alarm fire at an abandoned elementary school ( 40 percent of buildings in the Bronx were destroyed by the end of the 1970s , mostly via arson\u2014often torched by landlords seeking insurance windfalls ) .\nThink of Trump learning about the ins and outs of public life in this New York , a city of a frightened white outer-borough middle-class poised between fight or flight , in which real estate was everywhere and always a battleground , when the politics of race and crime bore all the intensity of civil war .\nIn The Invisible Bridge I wrote about what it was like in this New York in 1974 , the summer when the federal lawsuit against the Trumps was approaching its climax , the summer when a controversial new movie began packing theaters across the five boroughs .\n`` Death Wish '' starred a then-obscure Charles Bronson as a New York City architect who used to be liberal , until his daughter was raped and his wife murdered . His son-in-law pronounces defeat : \u201c There \u2019 s nothing we can do to stop it . Nothing but cut and run. \u201d The architect , by contrast , learns to shoot a gun\u2014in an Old West ghost town\u2014so he can start mowing down muggers at point-blank range . He soon cuts the city \u2019 s murder rate in half , and wins a spot on the cover of Time . Liberal reviewers registered their disgust : The Times \u2019 s Vincent Canby called it \u201c a bird-brained movie to cheer the hearts of the far-right wing , \u201d then , 10 days later , branded Bronson a \u201c circus bear. \u201d Time called it \u201c meretricious , \u201d \u201c brazen , \u201d and \u201c hysterical. \u201d Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times labeled it \u201c fascist. \u201d But in the real-life New York City , where the murder rate had doubled in 10 years , and where a psychiatrist published a Times op-ed bragging about the violence he had prevented by leveling a pistol that he kept \u201c never far from my reach while I attend to patients in my mid-Manhattan office , \u201d each onscreen vigilante act won ovations from grateful fans\u2014sometimes standing ovations .\nTwo years later came an even darker , and considerably more critical , portrait of New York City \u2019 s escalating culture of vigilantism . In Taxi Driver , a deranged Vietnam veteran speaks what must have been the unspoken inner monologue of any number of real-life New Yorkers who felt trapped in an urban sewer : \u201c Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. \u201d Pistol in hand , he rehearses his revenge in the mirror : \u201c Listen , you fuckers , you screwheads . Here is a man who would not take it any more . A man who stood up against the scum , the cunts , the dogs , the filth , the shit . Here is a man who stood up . \u201d\nWhen , around that time , Wall Street Journal columnist Irving Kristol coined the phrase \u201c a neoconservative is a liberal who \u2019 s been mugged by reality \u201d \u2014a bowdlerization of the older adage \u201c a conservative is a liberal who \u2019 s been mugged \u201d \u2014he probably didn \u2019 t have Charles Bronson in mind , let alone taxi driver Travis Bickle . Nonetheless the politics is all of a piece . Charles Bronson conservatism , Travis Bickle conservatism , the conservatism of avenging angels protecting white innocence in a \u201c liberal \u201d metropolis gone mad : this is New York City \u2019 s unique contribution to the history of conservatism in America , an ideological tradition heretofore unrecognized in the historical literature . But without it , we can not understand the rise of Donald Trump .\nTrump \u2019 s political debut , after all , came in response to a mugging . Following the infamous attack on a female jogger in Central Park , Trump purchased full pages in four New York newspapers demanding , \u201c Bring Back the Death Penalty . Bring Back Our Police ! \u201d All the hallmarks of his present crusade against \u201c political correctness \u201d were in evidence , such as the harkening to that bygone day when men were men , cops were cops , and punks were punks . He concluded : \u201c I miss the feeling of security New York \u2019 s finest once gave the citizens of this City. \u201d As I previously reported , these same police straight-jacketed by liberal timorousness had already coerced the rape suspects into confessions later proven to be false .\nThat \u2019 s N.Y.C. \u2019 s avenging-angel conservatism in a nutshell . And now that Trump is gliding toward an expected landslide in the New York primary on Tuesday , April 19 , we must begin the work of excavating its history .\nWe might start with William F. Buckley\u2014though other scholars can surely date it back further . The National Review editor \u2019 s quixotic campaign for New York mayor in 1965 is best remembered for a self-effacing quip . ( \u201c What will you do if you win ? \u201d he was asked . \u201c Demand a recount. \u201d ) Buckley himself is now celebrated as the genteel warrior of the conservatism of a more civilized age : The New York Times , upon his death in 2008 , averred of that 1965 race , \u201c He injected a rare degree of lofty oratory into city politics . \u201d\nWhat he also injected was an unprecedented reactionary thuggishness . Like his idea to \u201c undertake to quarantine all addicts , even as smallpox carriers would be quarantined during a plague. \u201d Or \u201c relocating chronic welfare cases outside the city limits \u201d \u2014in what his critics described as concentration camps for the poor . The campaign might have begun as a lark . He received hardly more than 10 percent of the vote . But in a harbinger of things to come , he finished second in some Catholic neighborhoods in Queens . Cops wore \u201c Buckley For Mayor \u201d buttons . When the election \u2019 s winner , the very liberal John Lindsay , campaigned in those same neighborhoods , young white men waved \u201c Support your Local Police \u201d placards in his face .\nThe stage was set , in 1966 , for the next New York City law-and-order melodrama . Lindsay , now mayor , fulfilled a campaign pledge by establishing a Civilian Complaint Review Board to protect citizens from abusive cops , the better to restore trust in a police force whose utter rot was the subject that year of a bestselling book about a cop named Frank Serpico , whose reward for refusing to break the law was an attempt by fellow cops on his life .\nThe president of the Patrolmen \u2019 s Benevolent Association responded to Mayor Lindsay \u2019 s new board : \u201c I am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups and their gripes and their shouting. \u201d After a Brooklyn riot in which cops had been ordered not to use their nightsticks , the PBA got 96,888 signatures to put a referendum on the November ballot to dissolve the review board ( they only needed 25,000 ) . Their TV commercials brayed , Trump-like , Bronson-like , \u201c The addict , the criminal , the hoodlum : only the policeman stands between you and him. \u201d Buckley\u2014who had orated on the campaign trail , \u201c We need a much larger police force , enjoined to lust after the apprehension of criminals , \u201d unencumbered by \u201c any such political irons as civilian review boards \u201d \u2014might only have received 10 percent of the vote . But 12 months later , the anti-CCRB referendum won 63 percent of the popular vote . Even Jews , who were supposed to be liberal , opposed it 55 percent to 40 percent .\nTwo years later , George Wallace brought his independent presidential bid to Madison Square Garden . \u201c We need somemeanness , \u201d Wallace brayed . And he got it : police had to rescue black protesters from a mob that surrounded them and chanted , \u201c Kill \u2018 em ! \u201d The New Republic observed , \u201c Never again will you read about Berlin in the \u2019 30s without remembering this wild confrontation of two irrational forces . \u201d\nThe confrontation is the key : one of the things that makes New York \u2019 s conservatism of avenging angels so feral is its proximity to so many damned left-wingers . Left-wingers like Mayor Lindsay\u2014who only won reelection in 1969 because the white ethnic backlash vote was split between two candidates , one of whom , Mario Procaccino , helped popularize the phrase \u201c limousine liberal \u201d in describing Lindsay .\nIn 1971 , Lindsay elected to build publicly subsidized housing in the Queens neighborhood of Forest Hills , partly upon the presumption that its largely Jewish population , only two and half decades on from the Holocaust , would be relatively free from racism of the Fred Trump sort . Apparently hizzoner wasn \u2019 t paying attention to the growing following behind Rabbi Meir Kahane , the domestic terrorist who was another of New York City \u2019 s sui generis contributions to the history of the American right .\nVillage Voice columnist Jack Newfield reported from one of the mayor \u2019 s damage-control sessions at the Forest Hills Jewish Community Center , where Jews called \u201c Lindsay redneck names under the shadow of the Torah. \u201d The Voice \u2019 s Paul Cowan heard a picketer boast , \u201c If Lindsay ever gets to be president , I \u2019 ll kill him . I \u2019 ll do just what Oswald did to John Kennedy. \u201d His companion replied , \u201c You won \u2019 t get the chance . Lindsay is going to get shot right here in New York . \u201d\nDonald Trump , 25 years old , was just then beginning his apprenticeship in his father \u2019 s real estate organization .\nHe made the acquaintance of Roy Cohn , who represented the family against the federal racial bias lawsuit , devising the defense that Fred Trump had no intention of excluding black tenants , just welfare recipients . Trump became a student of the legendarily reptilian thug who came to prominence as Joseph McCarthy \u2019 s lawyer . Long-time Trump-watcher Michael D \u2019 Antonio has explained : \u201c Both were members of Le Club , a private hot spot where the rich and famous and social climbers could meet without suffering the presence of ordinary people. \u201d Writes D \u2019 Antonio , \u201c Cohn modeled a style for Trump that was one part friendly gossip and one part menace . . . . Trump kept a photo of the glowering Cohn so he could show it to those who might be chilled by the idea that this man was his lawyer . \u201d\nIt was Cohn , indeed , who introduced Trump to the nearly-as-reptilian Roger Stone , the professional dirty trickster and sexual adventurer with the giant tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back\u2014and who , even though Trump has called him a \u201c stone-cold loser , \u201d has managed to hang on to a position of influence in the Trump presidential campaign . He certainly maintains an influence on Donald Trump \u2019 s view of the world . \u201c When somebody screws you , \u201d Stone told a reporter , \u201c Screw \u2019 em back\u2014but a lot harder. \u201d Figures like Cohn and Stone represent another branch in the New York conservative tradition : flashy , hedonistic right-wing operatives who gargle with razor blades and wear their shiny silver three-piece suits like armor .\nA former liberal , Koch won his underdog mayoral victory in 1977 in a madcap electoral free-for-all whose tenor was set on the night of July 13 , when a series of lightning strikes shut down transmissions lines , the city shuddered to black , and so much crime ensued that buses filled with men in chains shuttled from jailhouse to jailhouse in search of available cells .\nNeoconservative Midge Decter wrote in Commentary that it was like \u201c having been given a sudden glimpse into the foundations of one \u2019 s house and seen , with horror , that it was utterly infested and rotting away. \u201d The supposedly liberal readership of The New York Times wrote letters to the editor like this one : \u201c The Puerto Ricans can go back to Puerto Rico . They belong there anyway , and if the blacks do not shape up they can go to the South . \u201d\nEd Koch was virtually unknown outside his Greenwich Village neighborhood , but with a pledge to restore the death penalty , his campaign took off like a rocket . Never mind that the New York mayor had no power over capital punishment . The people had spoken : a mere 25 percent opposed bringing back what New York Daily News called \u201c little hot squat . \u201d\nMeanwhile Koch berated the \u201c poverty pimps \u201d and \u201c povertitians \u201d holding a broke city hostage , demanded the abolition of the Board of Education ( a \u201c lard barrel of waste \u201d ) , denounced alleged welfare fraud , decried \u201c the nuts on the left who dump on middle class values. \u201d He promised , too , to unwind New York \u2019 s experiments with free college , generous welfare , and subsidized housing , which its cheerleaders on the left called \u201c socialism in one city . \u201d\nOne of those cheerleaders was the one-time front-runner in the race , the very liberal Congresswoman Bella Abzug . After the blackout riots , her campaign went into a tailspin ; she didn \u2019 t even make it into the runoff .\nAn underdog did instead : the young Mario Cuomo . He said , \u201c the death penalty can not provide jobs for the poor . The electric chair can not balance the budget . The electric chair can not educate our children . The electric chair can not give us a sound economy or save us from bankruptcy or even save my seventy-seven-year-old mother. \u201d And besides , he would add , America was better than that . Or was it ? One time when he tried to make that same point , an old lady in Brooklyn spat in his face . Another time , someone stood up and cried , \u201c Kill them ! \u201d\nKoch won , of course , and then served as New York \u2019 s mayor for the next dozen years . Although to outer-borough reactionaries like state Senator Chris Mega of Brooklyn , he was just another liberal sellout on gun control . At a December 1984 press conference , Mega demanded to know : \u201c When will Mayor Koch provide the same level of protection to the citizens who ride the subways and pay their taxes that he enjoys surrounded by a phalanx of New York \u2019 s finest , guns at the ready ? \u201d\nThat particular press conference was called by the National Rifle Association in support of Bernhard Goetz , an electronics salesman from Kew Gardens , Queens , who shot five young men on a graffiti-encrusted subway car who , depending on whom you believed , were either preparing to mug him or aggressively panhandling for $ 5 . Like the character played by Charles Bronson , Goetz made the cover of Time magazine . Celebratory bumper stickers bloomed : \u201c Ride With Bernie\u2014He Goetz Them. \u201d In a later interview he reflected , Travis Bickle-like , \u201c The guys I shot represented the failure of society . . . . Forget about their ever making a positive contribution to society . It \u2019 s only a question of how much a price they \u2019 re going to cost . The solution is their mothers should have had an abortion . \u201d\nOne of Goetz \u2019 s biggest backers was Bob Grant , who beginning on WMCA in 1970 , and then on WOR ( until he was fired in 1979 for saying the only reason a black woman got her job was that \u201c she passed the gynecological and pigmentation test \u201d ) , virtually invented right-wing talk radio\u2014and when you think about it , it hardly could have been invented anywhere else but New York . Grant won the first live radio interview with Goetz , in 1986 , lamenting that he had not \u201c finished the job by killing them all . \u201d\nThree years later , after the assault in Central Park , Donald Trump offered his memorable argument to bring back little hot squat . \u201c What has happened is the complete breakdown of life as we know it . . . . How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits ? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS . \u201d\nIn 2011 , Bob Grant , impressed with Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign to force President Obama to produce his birth certificate , announced he had found his presidential candidate for 2012 . Grant died in 2014 , but two years later , his brand of vigilante conservatism has gone fully national . The wall Fred Trump sought to build in Queens in the early 1970s has been relocated 2,000 miles south . On Tuesday , Donald Trump will win a landslide in his home state . And somewhere , Bob Grant will be smiling .",

Like his idea to \u201cundertake to quarantine all addicts, even as smallpox carriers would be quarantined during a plague.\u201d Or \u201crelocating chronic welfare cases outside the city limits\u201d\u2014in what his critics described as concentration camps for the poor. The campaign might have begun as a lark. He received hardly more than 10 percent of the vote. But in a harbinger of things to come, he finished second in some Catholic neighborhoods in Queens. Cops wore \u201cBuckley For Mayor\u201d buttons. When the election\u2019s winner, the very liberal John Lindsay, campaigned in those same neighborhoods, young white men waved \u201cSupport your Local Police\u201d placards in his face.\n\nThe stage was set, in 1966, for the next New York City law-and-order melodrama. Lindsay, now mayor, fulfilled a campaign pledge by establishing a Civilian Complaint Review Board to protect citizens from abusive cops, the better to restore trust in a police force whose utter rot was the subject that year of a bestselling book about a cop named Frank Serpico, whose reward for refusing to break the law was an attempt by fellow cops on his life.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association responded to Mayor Lindsay\u2019s new board: \u201cI am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups and their gripes and their shouting.\u201d After a Brooklyn riot in which cops had been ordered not to use their nightsticks, the PBA got 96,888 signatures to put a referendum on the November ballot to dissolve the review board (they only needed 25,000). Their TV commercials brayed, Trump-like, Bronson-like, \u201cThe addict, the criminal, the hoodlum: only the policeman stands between you and him.\u201d Buckley\u2014who had orated on the campaign trail, \u201cWe need a much larger police force, enjoined to lust after the apprehension of criminals,\u201d unencumbered by \u201cany such political irons as civilian review boards\u201d\u2014might only have received 10 percent of the vote. But 12 months later, the anti-CCRB referendum won 63 percent of the popular vote. Even Jews, who were supposed to be liberal, opposed it 55 percent to 40 percent.\n\nTwo years later, George Wallace brought his independent presidential bid to Madison Square Garden. \u201cWe need somemeanness,\u201d Wallace brayed. And he got it: police had to rescue black protesters from a mob that surrounded them and chanted, \u201cKill \u2018em!\u201d The New Republic observed, \u201cNever again will you read about Berlin in the \u201930s without remembering this wild confrontation of two irrational forces.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation is the key: one of the things that makes New York\u2019s conservatism of avenging angels so feral is its proximity to so many damned left-wingers. Left-wingers like Mayor Lindsay\u2014who only won reelection in 1969 because the white ethnic backlash vote was split between two candidates, one of whom, Mario Procaccino, helped popularize the phrase \u201climousine liberal\u201d in describing Lindsay.\n\nIn 1971, Lindsay elected to build publicly subsidized housing in the Queens neighborhood of Forest Hills, partly upon the presumption that its largely Jewish population, only two and half decades on from the Holocaust, would be relatively free from racism of the Fred Trump sort. Apparently hizzoner wasn\u2019t paying attention to the growing following behind Rabbi Meir Kahane, the domestic terrorist who was another of New York City\u2019s sui generis contributions to the history of the American right.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nVillage Voice columnist Jack Newfield reported from one of the mayor\u2019s damage-control sessions at the Forest Hills Jewish Community Center, where Jews called \u201cLindsay redneck names under the shadow of the Torah.\u201d The Voice\u2019s Paul Cowan heard a picketer boast, \u201cIf Lindsay ever gets to be president, I\u2019ll kill him. I\u2019ll do just what Oswald did to John Kennedy.\u201d His companion replied, \u201cYou won\u2019t get the chance. Lindsay is going to get shot right here in New York.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump, 25 years old, was just then beginning his apprenticeship in his father\u2019s real estate organization.\n\nHe made the acquaintance of Roy Cohn, who represented the family against the federal racial bias lawsuit, devising the defense that Fred Trump had no intention of excluding black tenants, just welfare recipients. Trump became a student of the legendarily reptilian thug who came to prominence as Joseph McCarthy\u2019s lawyer. Long-time Trump-watcher Michael D\u2019Antonio has explained: \u201cBoth were members of Le Club, a private hot spot where the rich and famous and social climbers could meet without suffering the presence of ordinary people.\u201d Writes D\u2019Antonio, \u201cCohn modeled a style for Trump that was one part friendly gossip and one part menace. . . . Trump kept a photo of the glowering Cohn so he could show it to those who might be chilled by the idea that this man was his lawyer.\u201d\n\nIt was Cohn, indeed, who introduced Trump to the nearly-as-reptilian Roger Stone, the professional dirty trickster and sexual adventurer with the giant tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back\u2014and who, even though Trump has called him a \u201cstone-cold loser,\u201d has managed to hang on to a position of influence in the Trump presidential campaign. He certainly maintains an influence on Donald Trump\u2019s view of the world. \u201cWhen somebody screws you,\u201d Stone told a reporter, \u201cScrew \u2019em back\u2014but a lot harder.\u201d Figures like Cohn and Stone represent another branch in the New York conservative tradition: flashy, hedonistic right-wing operatives who gargle with razor blades and wear their shiny silver three-piece suits like armor.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNext comes an avenging angel named Ed Koch.\n\nA former liberal, Koch won his underdog mayoral victory in 1977 in a madcap electoral free-for-all whose tenor was set on the night of July 13, when a series of lightning strikes shut down transmissions lines, the city shuddered to black, and so much crime ensued that buses filled with men in chains shuttled from jailhouse to jailhouse in search of available cells.\n\nNeoconservative Midge Decter wrote in Commentary that it was like \u201chaving been given a sudden glimpse into the foundations of one\u2019s house and seen, with horror, that it was utterly infested and rotting away.\u201d The supposedly liberal readership of The New York Times wrote letters to the editor like this one: \u201cThe Puerto Ricans can go back to Puerto Rico. They belong there anyway, and if the blacks do not shape up they can go to the South.\u201d\n\nEd Koch was virtually unknown outside his Greenwich Village neighborhood, but with a pledge to restore the death penalty, his campaign took off like a rocket. Never mind that the New York mayor had no power over capital punishment. The people had spoken: a mere 25 percent opposed bringing back what New York Daily News called \u201clittle hot squat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMeanwhile Koch berated the \u201cpoverty pimps\u201d and \u201cpovertitians\u201d holding a broke city hostage, demanded the abolition of the Board of Education (a \u201clard barrel of waste\u201d), denounced alleged welfare fraud, decried \u201cthe nuts on the left who dump on middle class values.\u201d He promised, too, to unwind New York\u2019s experiments with free college, generous welfare, and subsidized housing, which its cheerleaders on the left called \u201csocialism in one city.\u201d\n\nOne of those cheerleaders was the one-time front-runner in the race, the very liberal Congresswoman Bella Abzug. After the blackout riots, her campaign went into a tailspin; she didn\u2019t even make it into the runoff.\n\nAn underdog did instead: the young Mario Cuomo. He said, \u201cthe death penalty cannot provide jobs for the poor. The electric chair cannot balance the budget. The electric chair cannot educate our children. The electric chair cannot give us a sound economy or save us from bankruptcy or even save my seventy-seven-year-old mother.\u201d And besides, he would add, America was better than that. Or was it? One time when he tried to make that same point, an old lady in Brooklyn spat in his face. Another time, someone stood up and cried, \u201cKill them!\u201d\n\nKoch won, of course, and then served as New York\u2019s mayor for the next dozen years. Although to outer-borough reactionaries like state Senator Chris Mega of Brooklyn, he was just another liberal sellout on gun control. At a December 1984 press conference, Mega demanded to know: \u201cWhen will Mayor Koch provide the same level of protection to the citizens who ride the subways and pay their taxes that he enjoys surrounded by a phalanx of New York\u2019s finest, guns at the ready?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThat particular press conference was called by the National Rifle Association in support of Bernhard Goetz, an electronics salesman from Kew Gardens, Queens, who shot five young men on a graffiti-encrusted subway car who, depending on whom you believed, were either preparing to mug him or aggressively panhandling for $5. Like the character played by Charles Bronson, Goetz made the cover of Time magazine. Celebratory bumper stickers bloomed: \u201cRide With Bernie\u2014He Goetz Them.\u201d In a later interview he reflected, Travis Bickle-like, \u201cThe guys I shot represented the failure of society. . . . Forget about their ever making a positive contribution to society. It\u2019s only a question of how much a price they\u2019re going to cost. The solution is their mothers should have had an abortion.\u201d\n\nOne of Goetz\u2019s biggest backers was Bob Grant, who beginning on WMCA in 1970, and then on WOR (until he was fired in 1979 for saying the only reason a black woman got her job was that \u201cshe passed the gynecological and pigmentation test\u201d), virtually invented right-wing talk radio\u2014and when you think about it, it hardly could have been invented anywhere else but New York. Grant won the first live radio interview with Goetz, in 1986, lamenting that he had not \u201cfinished the job by killing them all.\u201d\n\nThree years later, after the assault in Central Park, Donald Trump offered his memorable argument to bring back little hot squat. \u201cWhat has happened is the complete breakdown of life as we know it. . . . How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Bob Grant, impressed with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to force President Obama to produce his birth certificate, announced he had found his presidential candidate for 2012. Grant died in 2014, but two years later, his brand of vigilante conservatism has gone fully national. The wall Fred Trump sought to build in Queens in the early 1970s has been relocated 2,000 miles south. On Tuesday, Donald Trump will win a landslide in his home state. And somewhere, Bob Grant will be smiling.\n\nThis story first appeared on the Washington Spectator",
