Only 53 % trust \u201c online-only media . \u201d\nEdelman released the report ahead of its presentation at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , which begins Wednesday ( Jan. 20 ) .\nThe results imply that readers are more likely to trust a headline they read in Google \u2019 s news aggregator , over the same headline on its original website . This is not exactly encouraging news to the journalism industry .\nOne reason for the disparity could be the way news outlets package stories for specific platforms . Headlines that have been optimized for search engines are usually short and fact-based ( hence the trust ) , while headlines shared on other platforms\u2014social media in particular\u2014can be more open to interpretation .
