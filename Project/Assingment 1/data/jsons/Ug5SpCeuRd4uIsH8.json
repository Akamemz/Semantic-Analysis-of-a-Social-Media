What most of the MSM have reported about Bergdahl and the circumstances surrounding his release are facts .\nSecond , to cast the critical reporting as pure partisanship by Fox and others is to live in a hermetically sealed bubble . CNN and the New York Times were aggressive in interviewing soldiers who served with Bergdahl and are angry about what they see as a desertion from his Afghan post that put other lives at risk . The AP says the Pentagon concluded he walked off base back in 2010 .
