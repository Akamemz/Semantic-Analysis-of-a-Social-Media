    "content": "WASHINGTON ( CNN ) On the eve of the midterm elections , Democrats continue to hold a double-digit lead over Republicans in a generic congressional ballot among likely voters , according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS . The party 's 55 % to 42 % advantage in the new poll mirrors their lead in early October and is about the same as the 10-point edge they held just after Labor Day .\nThat 's a slimmer edge than the party held in CNN 's final poll before the 2006 midterm elections and similar to the Republicans ' 10-point advantage just before the 2010 midterms .\nDemocrats benefit from a massive gender gap that has persisted throughout the fall ( women favor Democrats 62 % to 35 % , while men are about evenly divided , 49 % back the Republican , while 48 % support the Democrat in their district ) , a wide lead among political independents ( 53 % for the Democrat to 39 % for the Republican ) , and strong support from black and Latino voters ( 88 % of black voters and 66 % of Latino voters favor the Democrats ) .\nThe gender gap cuts across lines of race and education , with non-white women ( 79 % favor Democrats ) and white women with college degrees ( 68 % back the Democrat ) breaking most heavily for the Democrats , while white men ( 57 % Republican ) and particularly white men without college degrees ( 65 % back the Republican ) are most deeply behind the GOP .\nAbout 7 in 10 likely voters say that when they cast a ballot on Tuesday , they 'll be sending a message about President Donald Trump , and more often than not , the message those voters want to send is one of opposition .\nOverall , 42 % of likely voters say their vote will be to express opposition to the president , while 28 % say that it 'll be to support him .\nAnother 28 % say their vote is n't about the president . That level of opposition is similar to the way likely voters felt just ahead of the 2006 election , when 41 % said they were voting to oppose then-President George W. Bush . Fewer voters in that year , just 16 % , said they were turning out to support the president .\nTrump 's approval rating in the poll stands at 39 % overall , with 55 % disapproving , slightly worse than in early October , when 41 % approved of his performance and 52 % disapproved .\nThat is the worst pre-election approval rating for any president approaching their first midterm election in polling dating back to Eisenhower .\nAmong likely voters , a majority , 52 % say they strongly disapprove of the way the president is handling his job , 35 % say they strongly approve of his work as President , and just 11 % of those likely to vote on Tuesday say they do n't have strong views on Trump .\nWith the election just days away as the poll was conducted , enthusiasm was up among both parties ' voters , but Democrats advantage in enthusiasm narrowed to just 4 points : 68 % of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were enthusiastic about voting , while 64 % of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the same .\nA majority of likely voters ( 52 % ) say they consider health care extremely important to their vote for Congress on Tuesday , with immigration and Trump closely behind at 49 % each .
