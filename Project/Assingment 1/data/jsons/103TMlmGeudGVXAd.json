''\nHe described how many soldiers are feeling frustrated with the conduct of the war against militants in the northeast of Nigeria , claiming that the terrorist 's guns are `` past the Nigerian army weapon . ''\n`` They give us just AK47s to go into the bush to fight Boko Haram , '' the soldier said . `` Our equipment does n't work and they give us just two magazines to go into the bush .
