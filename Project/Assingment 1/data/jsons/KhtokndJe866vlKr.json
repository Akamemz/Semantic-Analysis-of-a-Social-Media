Brian Kemp ( R ) announced Monday afternoon that they are taking the initial steps of allowing `` non-essential '' businesses to reopen .\nThe `` vast majority '' of businesses in Tennessee will be permitted to restart their engines on May 1 . `` Social distancing must continue , but our economic shutdown can not , '' Lee said in a statement . `` While I am not extending the 'Safer at Home ' order past the end of April , we are working directly with our major metropolitan areas to ensure they are in a position to reopen as soon and safely as possible . Social distancing works , and as we open up our economy , it will be more important than ever that we keep social distancing as lives and livelihoods depend on it . ''\nIn Georgia , gyms , bowling alleys , salons , and massage therapists will be able to accept clients beginning April 24 , though Kemp added that they will be subject to social-distancing guidelines and will have to conduct temperature screens for employees . Theatres , private clubs , and restaurants will be allowed to resume business starting April 27 , with additional guidance to be released later this week . Bars and nightclubs will remain shuttered .\nThese plans will draw from President Donald Trump 's three-phase federal guidelines for jumpstarting an economy that has been brought to a grinding halt by mandated social-isolation orders meant to curb the spread of COVID-19 . As my colleague Eric Boehm wrote :\nIn phase one , the administration says vulnerable individuals should continue to shelter at home , gatherings of 10 or more people will be prohibited , schools would remain closed , and employees would be strongly encouraged to work from home whenever possible . Bars , restaurants , gyms , and other gathering places could be permitted to open , but only if they `` adhere to strict physical distancing '' guidelines .\nTo meet the threshold advised to begin phase one , states should show they have sufficient virus tracing , hospital capacity , and testing . Kemp said in a Monday press conference that Georgia was `` on track '' to meet those three goals , placing particular emphasis on the importance of the latter . `` Testing defines the battlefield and aids our long term strategy , '' he said , noting that the National Guard and the Georgia Emergency Management Agency will work to increase testing numbers .\n`` By taking this measured action , we will get Georgians back to work safely , without undermining the progress we all have made in this battle against COVID-19 , '' Kemp said . `` Today 's announcement is a small step forward and should be treated as such .
