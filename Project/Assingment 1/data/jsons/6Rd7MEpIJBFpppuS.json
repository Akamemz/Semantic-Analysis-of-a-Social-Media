He said , no collusion with the Russian hoax . And I said , I wonder why he did n't lie about that , too , like everything else , '' Mr Trump said .\nCohen , 52 , will start a three-year prison term in May for the campaign finance violation of paying hush money to one of Mr Trump 's alleged mistresses , tax evasion and lying to Congress .\nIn his public testimony to the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday , he said Mr Trump `` knew of and directed '' plans for a Trump Tower Moscow , while stating publicly that he had no dealings in Russia .\n`` At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him , '' Cohen testified , `` he would look me in the eye and tell me there 's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing . In his way , he was telling me to lie . ''\nHowever , Cohen has been convicted of lying to Congress when he testified in 2017 that attempts to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow had stopped by January 2016 .\nHe has since acknowledged negotiations actually continued until June 2016 in the midst of the election campaign , though the real estate project ultimately did not go ahead .\nCohen apologised on Wednesday for his earlier false statements to Congress , which he claimed were `` reviewed and edited '' by Mr Trump 's lawyers .\nJay Sekulow , counsel to President Trump , said in a statement after the hearing : `` Today 's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false . ''\nCohen also suggested federal prosecutors in New York are investigating some unspecified crime involving Trump .\nCohen said he was in Mr Trump 's office in July 2016 when Roger Stone , a longtime political adviser , called the then-Republican presidential candidate .\nThe witness said Mr Stone rang Mr Trump to let him know he had been speaking to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , who told him there would be a `` massive dump '' of emails within a couple of days that would politically embarrass Hillary Clinton 's White House campaign .\nCohen said Mr Trump responded along the lines of `` would n't that be great '' .\nMr Trump has denied having prior knowledge about Wikileaks ' disclosure of Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) emails during the election .\nThe messages - which US authorities say were hacked by Russian intelligence - caused a damaging rift among Democrats by exposing how party officials preferred Mrs Clinton over her challenger for the presidential nomination , Bernie Sanders .\nMr Stone , a self-proclaimed political dirty trickster , is currently facing charges of lying to Congress about his communications with Wikileaks and witness tampering .\nAnyone who 's met Michael Cohen recently will tell you that he 's burning with anger at having to take the blame for crimes he says were instigated by Trump .\nIt seems he 's spent weeks being intensively prepped by his lawyers for this moment and intends to do the President fatal damage .\nThe White House talking points - farmed out to surrogates such as Donald Trump Jr - are that he 's a `` disgraced liar '' and `` convicted perjurer '' .\nCohen certainly knows he has - as he says in his testimony - a credibility problem .\nThat 's why he 's attempting to wield a stiletto , not swing an axe , each charge backed up by what he calls `` documents that are irrefutable '' - hence the dramatic production of a cheque apparently signed by Trump ( the alleged refund for paying off Stormy Daniels ) .\nHe did n't talk much about whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia . In fact , he said he had no direct knowledge of collusion .\nHe did , though , say he witnessed Trump in a telephone conversation during the campaign that showed he knew in advance Wikileaks was about to publish emails hacked - by Russia - from the Democratic Party .\nThat would be hugely significant , if true . Trump has always denied it .\nCohen testified that , contrary to Mr Trump 's repeated claims , he seemed to have advance knowledge of a meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between his campaign aides and a Russian lawyer promising `` dirt '' on Mrs Clinton .\nThe June 2016 meeting has been investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller , who is winding up a 21-month justice department inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with an alleged Kremlin plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election .\nCohen spoke about an incident when Mr Trump 's son , Donald Jr , walked behind his father 's desk and told him in a low voice : `` The meeting is all set . ''\nMr Trump , Cohen told the hearing , replied : `` OK good , let me know . ''\nImportantly , Cohen also said under oath that he has no direct evidence that Mr Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia .\n`` I do not , '' he said . `` I want to be clear . But I have my suspicions . ''\nHe said : `` He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that was n't a 'shithole . '\n`` This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States .\n`` While we were once driving through a struggling neighbourhood in Chicago , he commented that only black people could live that way .\n`` And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid . And yet I continued to work for him . ''\nCohen provided what he said was evidence of reimbursements he received from the president for hush money the lawyer has admitted paying to a porn star who says she had an affair with Mr Trump .\nHe submitted to the committee a copy of his $ 130,000 ( \u00a397,000 ) wire transfer to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet - a payment which led to Cohen 's conviction for campaign finance violations .\nCohen also gave the panel a copy of a $ 35,000 cheque dated August 2017 - one of a series he said Mr Trump signed to pay him back in instalments .\n`` Lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets , '' Cohen said . `` She is a kind , good person .
