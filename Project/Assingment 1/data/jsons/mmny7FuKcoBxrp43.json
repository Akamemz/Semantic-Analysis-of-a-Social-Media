    "content": "In an attempt to give moderate Republicans , who are disturbed by Donald Trump , an escape hatch , Hillary Clinton has dubbed Trump and his supporters the \u2018 Alt-right. \u2019 In layman \u2019 s terms , she means you are bigoted , racist , homophobic , xenophobic and a demagogue if you support Trump .\nIn doing so , she \u2019 s defending the Republican Party of Mitt Romney who was also called elitist and racist in the last presidential election of 2012 .\nMany define the \u201c alt-right \u201d as opposing diversity and immigration , believing they are superior to all other humans . This is the Clinton campaign \u2019 s vain attempt to thwart Trump \u2019 s unprecedented outreach to minorities for the past two weeks ( as no Republican ever has ) .\nIn reaction , Clinton \u2019 s vice-presidential running-mate Sen. Tim Kaine compared Trump and his supporters to slave owners . Kaine ? This represents the Alt-Left .\nThe Alt-left is a group of people who have nothing to offer . They have no facts to support their opinion and their factual assessments are grossly out of context and disingenuous . This group will blame minority communities \u2019 problems on the rest of the country . They will use shocking statistics pointing to the harsh realities these minorities face . But , when a candidate like Trump begins to share those same numbers and offer different solutions , they attack what was previously their own language as racist and dark .\nClinton is the queen of the kingdom of Alt-Left . Spanning four decades , a single year hasn \u2019 t known the absence of a Hillary Clinton scandal . She wants us to forget that .\n\u2018 Alt-Lefters \u2019 have no common sense or business acumen so they cheat in order to make profit : The Clintons \u2019 Whitewater scandal . One doesn \u2019 t have to look further than to the video of Hillary Clinton laughing about helping a rape victim ( who she knows was guilty ) escape prosecution . When it comes to politics , which delivers a lot of personal-power , the corruption is even worse : private email servers exposing state secrets , the selling of access ( for tens-of-millions of dollars ) via donations to their so-called \u2018 charity \u2019 Clinton Foundation and an avalanche of lies covering up this illicit behavior .\nClinton is appealing to the moderate-Republicans with her Alt-Right rhetoric . She knows they are scared . I call these \u2018 moderates \u2019 rabbits . They stand on the side of the road and nibble on the grass . At the first sight of traffic they run into the weeds and hide . They serve very little purpose and they reproduce rapidly . The Alt-Left ( uh\u2026Clinton ) is the car . The moment she swerves in their direction , the moderate Republican-rabbit runs .\nWhat is the Alt-Right ? In my view , these are the people who fight back , run toward challenges , speak with candor and a refreshing air of the truth . Occasionally , they make you cringe due to a heart of passion ( not hate ) . These are the leaders and influencers who have the ability to cause change .\nOn the Alt-Left , truth has no place in the journey for power and attention . For example , the Democratic National Committee email leak ( from Wikileaks ) proves they will even cheat amongst their own ranks . Disgraced chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz gave us a glimpse of their playbook : attack and destroy all political foes . The call to action was to attack Democrat presidential candidate Bernie Sanders regarding his faith and religion , essentially casting him as an atheist .\nThe Alt-Left \u2019 s only agenda is to disparage their opponent in order to cause fear and distract voters from assailant \u2019 s own deviant behavior . Their biggest weapon is to camouflage the vast array of differences amongst races , faith , gender and cultural backgrounds while projecting their own inherent racism , immorality , bigotry and elitism onto their opponent .\nThe Alt-Left exhibits many of the traits of borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) : fear of abandonment , up and down moods , unstable self-image , impulsive and risky behavior . These symptoms are the personification of people who consistently use projection .\nI \u2019 m certainly not labeling anyone as BPD , but I am pointing out that the Alt-Left has some of the worst personality traits known to mankind .\nThe \u2018 Alternative Right \u2019 is not inherently \u2018 Right \u2019 or conservative at all .
