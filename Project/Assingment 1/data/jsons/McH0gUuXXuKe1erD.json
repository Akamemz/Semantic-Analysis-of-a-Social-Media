    "content": "Hillary Clinton recently took \u201c full responsibility \u201d for her 2016 loss . Only she didn \u2019 t . Instead of explaining what the historian Thucydides once called the \u201c truest causes \u201d ( aitiai ) , she went on to list at least three pretexts ( prophases ) for her defeat : sexism , FBI director James Comey , and the purported Russian hacking of her unsecured e-mail server and the John Podesta e-mail trove .\nClinton \u2019 s accusations also raise the larger question of why a presidential candidate wins or loses an election .\nIn general , there seem to be five hinges of fate : personality , positions on the issues , the general political atmosphere of the era , the quality of the campaign , and sudden and unforeseen outside events such as depression , scandal , or war . Even a biased media or lots of money pales in comparison .\nTake sexism . Hillary Clinton found her sex an advantage in being elected to the U.S. Senate from New York . For a generation , among the most powerful and successful figures in U.S. politics were three progressive , multimillionaire , Bay Area women who , in a most non-diverse fashion , lived within 50 miles of one another : Barbara Boxer , Diane Feinstein , and Nancy Pelosi .\nFrom 1997 to 2013 women of both parties were in charge of U.S. foreign policy as secretary of state , for twelve out of 16 years . One could make the argument that \u201c the first female president \u201d was an advantageous campaigning point , not a drawback ; it was certainly designed to bookend Barack Obama \u2019 s successful trumpeting of being the first African-American president .\nBlaming a deer-in-the-headlights FBI director James Comey is equally problematic . His passive-aggressive pronouncements irrationally first exonerated her , then did not , then did again . Faulting the FBI for her own likely felonious behavior of sending and receiving classified communications on an unsecured server ( or of Bill Clinton \u2019 s trying to leverage Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an airport tarmac ) is sort of like blaming the defeat at Pearl Harbor on the Japanese \u2014 true , but hardly the whole story given America \u2019 s responsibility for its own unpreparedness .\nIn similar fashion , had Donald Trump lost , he might have faulted the Washington Post for airing the decade-old Access Hollywood tape that nearly destroyed his campaign , as if the clear ill will and partisanship of Jeff Bezos \u2019 s Post were not empowered by Trump \u2019 s own private , hot-mic \u2014 but nonetheless crude \u2014 statements . The Germans claimed that harsh snows and the last-minute campaign in the Balkans had delayed and thus doomed their 1941 Russian offensive , as if the Red Army did not have a say or as if Germans were a tropical people .\nAs far as the Russians , they are Russians \u2014 always seeking to throw wrenches into the gears of U.S. elections . The Republicans claimed that their firewalls kept the Russians out of RNC e-mail ; John Podesta using \u201c password \u201d for his password invited them in . And , of course , no one forced Washington journalists to collude through e-mail with the Clinton campaign , and no one ordered Hillary to jerry-rig a home-brewed server . The Russian-collusion bogeyman was probably as effective a campaign prop for Clinton as the supposed Russian-inspired e-mail revelations were for Trump .\nMore likely , Clinton lost the key , Rust Belt states that swung the electoral vote to Trump for our five classic reasons .\nHer personality , in far different ways , was as polarizing as Trump \u2019 s . But Trump was far better as a TV showman , given his long stint on reality TV . Hillary \u2019 s voice , facial expressions , and comportment were not winning . Even on the rare occasions that she told the truth , she seemed more insincere than Trump , even when he was spinning a yarn .\nTrump \u2019 s image as a bad boy was less damaging than Hillary \u2019 s as a scold . Both are roughly the same age and , to the eye , not in the best of shape , but Trump displayed an almost animal energy while Clinton often appeared frail , worn , and on occasion ill on the stump . In Ken Kesey \u2019 s One Flew over the Cuckoo \u2019 s Nest , the reader sympathizes with the pseudo-patient and con Randle McMurphy , who does everything haywire , rather than \u201c Big Nurse \u201d Mildred Ratched , who does everything by the book ; the former was at least undeniably alive , the latter only ostensibly so .\nSecond , Hillary Clinton had no real sincere position on any issue other than a desire to stay in public office for nearly a quarter-century , and her willingness to extend the eight years of the Obama agenda \u2014 an agenda that had never achieved 2 percent economic growth and that saw record labor non-participation , a doubling of the national debt to $ 20 trillion , and a world in chaos abroad .\nOnce Obama got wise in January 2016 that he was the most popular when he was not seen or heard , he dropped out of sight and kept silent . Meanwhile , 17 Republicans along with Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton hogged the national spotlight and tore one another apart . Through it all , Obama \u2019 s eight-year-long stream of dismal popularity ratings gradually improved . But his newfound transient popularity did not mean that most Americans liked Obama \u2019 s policies or judged them as successful .\nThe result was that Hillary played a losing 1968 Hubert Humphrey to Obama \u2019 s lame-duck Lyndon Johnson \u2014 she risked an occasionally meek nip on the administration \u2019 s ankles but was otherwise silent about her own positions to the extent they even existed . In a year when people wanted a change from the prior eight years , Clinton offered none . \u201c I am a woman \u201d and \u201c Trump is a monster \u201d were not serious campaign issues , but they sum up the totality of why Clinton wished Americans to vote for her . Most still did , but not in the key states where Obamism had wrought disaster .\nThird , voters had , once again , tired of Washington politics . The aura of 2016 was \u201c drain the swamp \u201d change . A septuagenarian socialist , who was not a Democrat , nonetheless almost won the Democratic primary on the theme that a Washington insider Bernie Sanders was at least not a Clintonian apparatchik mired in quid-pro quo beltway payola .\nIn a normal year , a sober and judicious Jeb Bush , or a proven competent governor such as Scott Walker , or a charismatic ascendant such as Marco Rubio would have won the Republican nomination .\nTrump \u2019 s supposed vulgarity and crudity only enhanced his image as a reckless ( but nonetheless defiant ) Samson determined to pull down the supporting pillars of the rotten Washington temple .\nBut not in 2016 , when voters wearied of sermons about their ethical shortcomings delivered by liberal and conservative grandees who were not subject to the consequences of their own ideologies \u2014 whether on trade , globalization , illegal immigration , health care , the budget , or foreign policy . Many voters saw Hillary , accurately , as the epitome of self-interested professional politics , leading always to personal enrichment . Trump \u2019 s supposed vulgarity and crudity only enhanced his image as a reckless ( but nonetheless defiant ) Samson determined to pull down the supporting pillars of the rotten Washington temple \u2014 even if the wreckage fell on himself , he \u2019 d ensure rubble on everyone else as well . Hillary was the EU ; Trump was Brexit .\nFourth , arrogance , ignorance , and sloth are a fatal trifecta\u2014sort of like the conditions that led the Baltimore Colts to be disastrously upset by the New York Jets in Super Bowl III . The Colts \u2019 tried and true and careful Johnny Unitas proved no match for erratic and flamboyant Joe Namath .\nHaughtiness , insularity , and laziness characterized the conduct of the Clinton campaign . Even a novice outsider could see that Obama \u2019 s successful electoral matrix \u2014 record minority turnout and bloc voting , coupled with the drop-off in turnout by a disengaged white working middle class ( tired both of left-wing identity politics and Republican bluestocking elitism ) \u2014 was not going to be transferrable to an off-putting 69-year-old , white multimillionaire .\nNot only did Hillary Clinton lack Obama \u2019 s youthful vigor and mellifluousness ; she also seemed at times geriatric , snarky , and screechy . The result was that she did not win the minority vote at the levels she needed . Further , she galvanized the supposedly ossified and irrelevant white working classes to finally come out and vote , in their own bloc fashion , against her . Obama had guaranteed her his downside but never delivered his upside .\nClinton \u2019 s only chance to make up for missing identity-politics voters by appealing to the working classes of the Midwest was to replay her 2008 Annie Oakley Democratic-primary role \u2014 by drinking boilermakers in Milwaukee , or bowling in Scranton , or reminiscing about shooting guns as young gal . But eight years ago , the Democratic party was still aw-shucks Bill Clinton \u2019 s . In 2016 , it was captive to the identity-politics polarization so effectively deployed , in community-organizer style , by Barack Obama .\nSo instead Clinton doubled down on the tired theme that Rust Belt losers needed to shape up and get with the globalized progressive project and a demography-is-destiny new America . Obama had deprecated Pennsylvanians as has-beens clinging to their Bibles and guns ; Hillary updated them , adding \u201c half of Trump \u2019 s supporters \u201d as irredeemables and deplorables . Miners were toxic losers who needed to learn how to build solar panels rather than mine coal . In contrast , Trump called them \u201c our miners . \u201d\nShe made her disdain concrete by never campaigning in Wisconsin and only sporadically visiting the Blue Wall states eastward to the Carolinas .
