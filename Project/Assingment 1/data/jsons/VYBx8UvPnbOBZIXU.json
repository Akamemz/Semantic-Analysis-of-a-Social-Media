Keith Alexander also told Fox News last year that the agency does not `` hold data on U.S . citizens . ''\nBut the Guardian newspaper reported late Wednesday that the administration has been collecting the phone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon under a top secret court order .\nThe order , a copy of which apparently was obtained by The Guardian , reportedly was granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and is good until July 19 .\nIt requires Verizon , one of the nation 's largest telecommunications companies , on an `` ongoing , daily basis '' to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems , both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries .\nThe text of the order , as published by The Guardian , says that `` the Custodian of Records shall produce to the National Security Agency ( NSA ) upon service of this Order , and continue production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of this Order , unless otherwise ordered by the Court , an electronic copy of the '' the records in question .\nAdministration officials , while not directly acknowledging the order , defended their authority to collect records and stressed they 're not listening in on conversations .\nFurther , the heads of the Senate intelligence committee sought to calm concerns , saying the requests are carefully scrutinized .
