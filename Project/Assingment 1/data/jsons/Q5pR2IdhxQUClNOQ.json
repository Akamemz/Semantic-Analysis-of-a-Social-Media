ET , April 8\nIn a prolonged exchange Thursday afternoon , former President Bill Clinton forcefully defended his 1994 crime bill to Black Lives Matter protesters in the crowd at a Hillary Clinton campaign event .\nHe said the bill lowered the country 's crime rate , which benefited African-Americans , achieved bipartisan support , and diversified the police force . He then addressed a protester 's sign , saying :\n`` I do n't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children , '' Clinton said , addressing a protester who appeared to interrupt him repeatedly . `` Maybe you thought they were good citizens .... You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter . Tell the truth . You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns . ''\nThe Clintons have faced criticism from BLM activists and younger black voters for months now over that bill , which they say put an unfairly high number of black Americans in prison for nonviolent offenses .\nAfter a protester interrupted him repeatedly , Bill Clinton began to take on that critique directly , making the claim that his crime bill was being given a bad rap .\n`` Here 's what happened , '' Clinton said . `` Let 's just tell the whole story . ''\n`` I had an assault weapons ban in it [ the crime bill ] . I had money for inner-city kids , for out of school activities . We had 110,000 police officers so we could keep people on the street , not in these military vehicles , and the police would look like the people they were policing . We did all that . And [ Joe ] Biden [ then senator and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee ] said , you ca n't pass this bill , the Republicans will kill it , if you do n't put more sentencing in it . ''\n`` I talked to a lot of African-American groups , '' Clinton continued . `` They thought black lives matter . They said take this bill , because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs . We have 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals . ''\nThroughout the spirited defense of his policy , Clinton continued to be interrupted , and he repeatedly seemed to single out one protester .\n`` She does n't wan na hear any of that , '' Clinton said to the protester . `` You know what else she does n't want to hear ? Because of that bill , we have a 25-year low in crime , a 33-year low in murder rate . And because of that and the background check law , we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence , and who do you think those lives were ? That mattered ? Whose lives were saved that mattered ? ''\nFor several minutes , the discussion of the crime bill , Clinton 's exchange with the protester and the crowd 's attempts to yell and chant over her were missing one thing : any mention of Hillary Clinton , the one Clinton running for president this election cycle .\nBill Clinton did finally address her . `` Hillary did n't vote for that bill , because she was n't in the Senate , '' Clinton said . `` She was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids [ referencing her advocacy for the Children 's Health Insurance Program ] .
