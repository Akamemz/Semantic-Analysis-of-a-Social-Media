''\nAs if to confirm the Council 's claim , the infotech giant Google announced this week by the end of next year , its global operations will be fueled 100 percent by electricity generated by renewable sources . ( `` The science tells us that tackling climate change is an urgent global priority , '' the company 's press release explained . ) This does not mean that Google gets its electricity directly from solar panels on the roofs of its data centers or from wind turbines churning away on its corporate campuses . The company basically makes purchasing commitments to renewable projects that offset the conventionally generated electricity that it gets from local utilities .\nThere is , of course , nothing wrong with a business legally adopting measures that it thinks are in the best interests of its customers and shareholders . If the company is on the wrong track , those stakeholders will let Google 's executives know through their purchasing and investment choices .\nBut if clean energy really does cost less than dirty energy , then what is there to resist ? In that case , surely the invisible hand of the marketplace will make the transition to a clean-energy economy irrevocable . So can we all put aside our worries about catastrophic climate change ?\nGoogle notes that during `` the last six years , the cost of wind and solar came down 60 percent and 80 percent , respectively , proving that renewables are increasingly becoming the lowest cost option .
