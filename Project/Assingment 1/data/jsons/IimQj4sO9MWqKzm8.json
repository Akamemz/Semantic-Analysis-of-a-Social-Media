    "content": "On October 6 , some of America \u2019 s top political scientists gathered at Yale University to answer these questions . And nearly everyone agreed : American democracy is eroding on multiple fronts \u2014 socially , culturally , and economically .\nThe scholars pointed to breakdowns in social cohesion ( meaning citizens are more fragmented than ever ) , the rise of tribalism , the erosion of democratic norms such as a commitment to rule of law , and a loss of faith in the electoral and economic systems as clear signs of democratic erosion .\nNo one believed the end is nigh , or that it \u2019 s too late to solve America \u2019 s many problems . Scholars said that America \u2019 s institutions are where democracy has proven most resilient . So far at least , our system of checks and balances is working \u2014 the courts are checking the executive branch , the press remains free and vibrant , and Congress is ( mostly ) fulfilling its role as an equal branch .\nBut there was a sense that the alarm bells are ringing .\nYascha Mounk , a lecturer in government at Harvard University , summed it up well : \u201c If current trends continue for another 20 or 30 years , democracy will be toast . \u201d\nNancy Bermeo , a politics professor at Princeton and Harvard , began her talk with a jarring reminder : Democracies don \u2019 t merely collapse , as that \u201c implies a process devoid of will. \u201d Democracies die because of deliberate decisions made by human beings .\nUsually , it \u2019 s because the people in power take democratic institutions for granted . They become disconnected from the citizenry . They develop interests separate and apart from the voters . They push policies that benefit themselves and harm the broader population . Do that long enough , Bermeo says , and you \u2019 ll cultivate an angry , divided society that pulls apart at the seams .\nAdam Przeworski , a democratic theorist at New York University , suggested that democratic erosion in America begins with a breakdown in what he calls the \u201c class compromise. \u201d His point is that democracies thrive so long as people believe they can improve their lot in life . This basic belief has been \u201c an essential ingredient of Western civilization during the past 200 years , \u201d he said .\nBut fewer and fewer Americans believe this is true . Due to wage stagnation , growing inequalities , automation , and a shrinking labor market , millions of Americans are deeply pessimistic about the future : 64 percent of people in Europe believe their children will be worse off than they were ; the number is 60 percent in America .\nThat pessimism is grounded in economic reality . In 1970 , 90 percent of 30-year-olds in America were better off than their parents at the same age . In 2010 , only 50 percent were . Numbers like this cause people to lose faith in the system . What you get is a spike in extremism and a retreat from the political center . That leads to declines in voter turnout and , consequently , more opportunities for fringe parties and candidates .\nPolitical polarization is an obvious problem , but researchers like Przeworski suggest something more profound is going on . Political theorists like to talk about the \u201c social compact , \u201d which is basically an implicit agreement among members of society to participate in a system that benefits everyone .\nWell , that only works if the system actually delivers on its promises . If it fails to do so , if it leads enough people to conclude that the alternative is less scary than the status quo , the system will implode from within .\nIs that happening here ? Neither Przeworski nor anyone else went quite that far . But we know there \u2019 s a growing disconnect between productivity ( how hard people work ) and compensation ( how much they \u2019 re paid for that work ) . At the same time , we \u2019 ve seen a spike in racial animus , particularly on the right . It seems likely there \u2019 s a connection here .\nPrzeworski believes that American democracy isn \u2019 t collapsing so much as deteriorating . \u201c Our divisions are not merely political but have deep roots in society , \u201d he argues . The system has become too rigged and too unfair , and most people have no real faith in it .\nWhere does that leave us ? Nowhere good , Przeworski says . The best he could say is that \u201c our current crisis will continue for the foreseeable future . \u201d\nWe \u2019 ve heard a lot of chatter recently about the importance of democratic norms . These are the unwritten rules and the conventions that undergird a democracy \u2014 things like commitment to rule of law , to a free press , to the separation of powers , to the basic liberties of speech , assembly , religion , and property .\nDaniel Ziblatt , a politics professor at Harvard , called these norms \u201c the soft guardrails of democracy. \u201d Dying democracies , he argued , are always preceded by the breaking of these unwritten rules .\nResearch conducted by Bright Line Watch , the group that organized the Yale conference , shows that Americans are not as committed to these norms as you might expect .\nIt \u2019 s not that Americans don \u2019 t believe in democratic ideals or principles ; it \u2019 s that our beliefs scale with our partisan loyalties . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ezra Klein explained it well in a recent column :\nPeople \u2019 s opinions on democracy lie downstream from their partisan identity . If it had been Trump \u2019 s voters who had seen the Electoral College , gerrymandering , and Russia turn against them , then it would be Trump \u2019 s voters vibrating with outrage over the violation of key principles of American democracy .\nHypocrisy aside , the reaction of nearly half the country to Russia \u2019 s meddling says a lot about our attachment to core democratic values like free and fair elections .\nAnother startling finding is that many Americans are open to \u201c alternatives \u201d to democracy . In 1995 , for example , one in 16 Americans supported Army rule ; in 2014 , that number increased to one in six . According to another survey cited at the conference , 18 percent of Americans think a military-led government is a \u201c fairly good \u201d idea .\nZiblatt identified what he calls two \u201c master norms. \u201d The first is mutual toleration \u2014 whether we \u201c accept the basic legitimacy of our opponents. \u201d The second is institutional forbearance \u2014 whether politicians responsibly wield the power of the institutions they \u2019 re elected to control .\nAs for mutual toleration , America is failing abysmally ( more on this below ) . We \u2019 re hardly better on the institutional forbearance front .\nMost obviously , there \u2019 s Donald Trump , who has dispensed with one democratic norm after another . He \u2019 s fired an FBI director in order to undercut an investigation into his campaign \u2019 s possible collusion with Moscow ; staffed his White House with family members ; regularly attacked the free press ; and refused to divest himself of his business interests .\nThe Republican Party , with few exceptions , has tolerated these violations in the hope that they might advance their agenda . But it \u2019 s about a lot more than Republicans capitulating to Trump .\nZiblatt points to the GOP \u2019 s unprecedented blocking of President Obama \u2019 s Supreme Court nominee , Judge Merrick Garland , in 2016 as an example of institutional recklessness . In 2013 , Senate Democrats took a similarly dramatic step by eliminating filibusters for most presidential nominations . That same year , House Republicans endangered the nation \u2019 s credit rating and shut down the government over Obamacare .\nThere are countless other encroachments one could cite , but the point is clear enough : American democracy is increasingly less anchored by norms and traditions \u2014 and history suggests that \u2019 s a sign of democratic decay .\nTimur Kuran , a professor of economics and politics at Duke University , argued that the real danger we face isn \u2019 t that we no longer trust the government but that we no longer trust each other .\nKuran calls it the problem of \u201c intolerant communities , \u201d and he says there are two such communities in America today : \u201c identitarian \u201d activists concerned with issues like racial/gender equality , and the \u201c nativist \u201d coalition , people suspicious of immigration and cultural change .\nEach of these communities defines itself in terms of its opposition to the other . They live in different worlds , desire different things , and share almost nothing in common . There is no real basis for agreement and thus no reason to communicate .\nThe practical consequence of this is a politics marred by tribalism . Worse , because the fault lines run so deep , every political contest becomes an intractable existential drama , with each side convinced the other is not just wrong but a mortal enemy .\nConsider this stat : In 1960 , 5 percent of Republicans and 4 percent of Democrats objected to the idea of their children marrying across political lines . In 2010 , those numbers jumped to 46 percent and 33 percent respectively . Divides like this are eating away at the American social fabric .\nA 2014 Pew Research Center study reached a similar conclusion : `` In both political parties , most of those who view the other party very unfavorably say that the other side 's policies 'are so misguided that they threaten the nation 's well-being , ' '' Pew reports . `` Overall , 36 % of Republicans and Republican leaners say that Democratic policies threaten the nation , while 27 % of Democrats and Democratic leaners view GOP policies in equally stark terms . ''\nSo it \u2019 s not merely that we disagree about issues ; it \u2019 s that we believe the other side is a grievous threat to the republic . According to Pew , the numbers above have more than doubled since 1994 .\nKuran warns that autocrats tend to exploit these divisions by pushing \u201c policies that may seem responsive to grievances but are ultimately counterproductive. \u201d Think of Donald Trump \u2019 s \u201c Muslim ban \u201d or his insistence on building a giant wall on the southern border . Neither of these policies is likely to make a significant difference in the lives of Trump \u2019 s voters , but that \u2019 s not really the point .\nBy pandering to fears and resentments , Trump both deepens the prejudices and satisfies his base .\nTimothy Snyder , a Yale historian and author of the book On Tyranny , gave one of the more fascinating talks of the conference .\nStrangely enough , Snyder talked about time as a kind of political construct . ( I know that sounds weird , but bear with me . ) His thesis was that you can tell a lot about the health of a democracy based on how its leaders \u2014 and citizens \u2014 orient themselves in time .\nTake Trump \u2019 s \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d slogan . The slogan itself invokes a nostalgia for a bygone era that Trump voters believe was better than today and better than their imagined future . By speaking in this way , Snyder says , Trump is rejecting conventional politics in a subtle but significant way .\nWhy , after all , do we strive for better policies today ? Presumably it \u2019 s so that our lives can be improved tomorrow . But Trump reverses this . He anchors his discourse to a mythological past , so that voters are thinking less about the future and more about what they think they lost .\n\u201c Trump isn \u2019 t after success \u2014 he \u2019 s after failure , \u201d Snyder argued . By that , he means that Trump isn \u2019 t after what we \u2019 d typically consider success \u2014 passing good legislation that improves the lives of voters . Instead , Trump has defined the problems in such a way that they can \u2019 t be solved . We can \u2019 t be young again . We can \u2019 t go backward in time . We can \u2019 t relive some lost golden age . So these voters are condemned to perpetual disappointment .\nThe counterargument is that Trump \u2019 s idealization of the past is , in its own way , an expression of a desire for a better future . If you \u2019 re a Trump voter , restoring some lost version of America or revamping trade policies or rebuilding the military is a way to create a better tomorrow based on a model from the past .\nFor Snyder , though , that \u2019 s not really the point . The point is that Trump \u2019 s nostalgia is a tactic designed to distract voters from the absence of serious solutions . Trump may not be an authoritarian , Snyder warns , but this is something authoritarians typically do . They need the public to be angry , resentful , and focused on problems that can \u2019 t be remedied .\nSnyder calls this approach \u201c the politics of eternity , \u201d and he believes it \u2019 s a common sign of democratic backsliding because it tends to work only after society has fallen into disorder .\nBack in June , I interviewed political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels , authors of Democracy for Realists . They had a sobering thesis about democracy in America : Most people pay little attention to politics ; when they vote , if they vote at all , they do so irrationally and for contradictory reasons .\nOne of the recurring themes of this conference was that Americans are becoming less committed to liberal democratic norms . But were they ever really committed to those norms ? I \u2019 m not so sure . If Achen and Bartels are to be believed , most voters don \u2019 t hold fixed principles .
