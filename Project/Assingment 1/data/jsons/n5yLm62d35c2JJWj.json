    "content": "ATLANTA\u2014The upcoming Georgia special election to fill the seat of Health and Human Services Sec . Tom Price is putting the \u201c jungle \u201d in jungle primary . With 18 candidates , a $ 14 million tsunami of TV ads , a Republican field attacking each other like a pack of dingoes , and an unknown Democrat raising cash like a presidential contender , the usually ho-hum race for the suburban-Atlanta House seat has become an all-out war . If no candidate clears 50 percent in Tuesday \u2019 s primary , the top two will go on to a June 20 runoff and the war will continue for another eight weeks .\nAt the heart of the chaos is President Donald Trump , whose election in November solidified his base among the Tea Party faithful here , but also lit a fire of national resistance whose singular goal recently has become flipping Georgia \u2019 s 6th congressional district to Democratic hands . Trump won the solidly Republican district by just 1.5 percent . over Hillary Clinton .\nIn an ordinary election year , in an ordinary time , an open seat in or around Atlanta \u2019 s wealthy northern suburbs would be a mostly friendly contest between whichever two Republicans said they wanted the job . But the race has drawn a melee of 11 GOP hopefuls , a scramble of activists , gray-haired state-senators , Trump enthusiasts and businessmen .\nInstead of getting behind one or two of the strongest candidates , local Republican leaders have similarly scattered their support among the field . Former U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss is backing Karen Handel , a former secretary of state , while current U.S. Sen. David Perdue has gotten behind former state Sen. Dan Moody . Sean Hannity endorsed Tea Party founder Amy Kremer , while Sen. Marco Rubio , who won the district in the GOP presidential primary , is supporting state Sen. Judson Hill .\nThe Club for Growth has pumped $ 600,000 into the race to help businessman Bob Gray , but is also running a blistering attack ad against Handel , who is also getting attacked by Gray and Moody . Gray claims he was the only candidate to back Trump early on , but it was Bruce LeVell , not Gray , who arrived at an event in a \u201c Trump 2020 \u201d campaign bus and had former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski stumping for him . Confused yet ? That \u2019 s the problem for Republicans .\n\u201c It \u2019 s crazy , it \u2019 s a true jungle primary , \u201d said Kerwin Swint , the chair of the political science department at Kennesaw State University , which sits just beyond the district \u2019 s current lines . \u201c This is one of the headaches behind the way that Georgia does special elections , but it \u2019 s usually not this complex and it \u2019 s presenting some difficulties Republicans clearly didn \u2019 t anticipate . \u201d\nAmong those difficulties , along with the fact that the monster field has split money , air time , and enthusiasm between the Republicans , is that it has also opened the door to Jon Ossoff , the 30 year-old former congressional staffer whom national Democrats got behind early and rocketed to an unprecedented fundraising haul . Ossoff \u2019 s campaign reported $ 8.3 million raised since January , with much of that coming from small-dollar donations around the country through DailyKos , an early endorser , and ActBlue , the liberal activist fundraising portal .\nChip Lake , a longtime Republican consultant in Georgia , described Ossoff \u2019 s fundraising as an alarming possible glimpse into the future for Republican candidates in a Trump era .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been in this business for over 25 years and I have never seen anything like what Job Ossoff has been able to do , \u201d Lake said . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t mean he can win , but he is a shoe-in to make the runoff and two or three weeks ago we were worried he could get to 50 percent . They say money can \u2019 t buy you love , but it can buy a lot of votes . \u201d\nGiving money to Ossoff seems to be downright therapeutic for Democrats across the country looking for a way to stick it to Trump . Locally , volunteering for Ossoff seems to have the same result .\nTurin Mamoun , a stay-at-home mom from East Cobb County , Ga. went to her first-ever political meeting in January after Trump was elected president . \u201c I \u2019 m worried , very worried , \u201d she said before heading out to canvass for Ossoff Saturday afternoon . \u201c I \u2019 ve been a Democrat my whole life , but I \u2019 m scared now and I didn \u2019 t even know where to begin . \u201d\nMamoun and her friend , Sara Mhazel , met Ossoff at the Cobb County Democrats \u2019 meeting just after he got into the race .
