Changing the way those profits are treated in the tax code could provide some savings .\nOther Republicans like Price insist revenue from `` pro-growth tax reform '' is not something this budget conference committee can consider , telling CNN that debate has to `` go through regular order '' on a separate track in the tax-writing committees .\nBut on Tuesday Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid told reporters he would refuse to consider a deal that did not include any revenue .\nSetting aside revenue , Ryan and other Republicans emphasize a deal to replace the sequester should use savings from changes to entitlement programs like Medicare or Social Security to help adjust spending levels at federal agencies .
