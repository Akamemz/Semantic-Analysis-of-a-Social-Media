    "content": "By the time of Glenn Beck \u2019 s departure from Fox News in 2011 , Roger Ailes had been spending considerable energy discussing the consequences of an Obama reelection . For the past two and a half years , he had committed himself to blocking the Obama agenda . When the Affordable Care Act passed the previous March , \u201c he went apeshit , \u201d a senior producer said . Ailes instructed his producers to book former New York lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey , a conservative health care advocate who popularized the notion of \u201c death panels. \u201d \u201c He said she was the best person to talk about this , \u201d the senior producer recalled . \u201c He even gave her a prop : a giant stack of papers of the law itself . \u201d\nAnd so Ailes set out to recruit a viable Republican candidate . In the summer of 2010 , he invited Chris Christie to dinner at his home in Garrison with Rush Limbaugh . Like much of the GOP establishment , Ailes fell hard for the New Jersey governor . They talked about pension reform and getting tough with the unions . Ailes saw in Christie a great candidate : an ordinary guy , someone you \u2019 d be comfortable talking to over your back fence . But Ailes may have seen something else . Christie had Fox News television values with a ready-made reel . And , of course , Obama versus Christie was a producer \u2019 s dream : black versus white , thin versus fat , professor versus prosecutor . Maybe , just maybe , Ailes could laugh all the way to the White House and the bank . Nevertheless , Christie politely turned down Ailes \u2019 s calls to run . Christie joked at dinner that his weight was an issue . \u201c I still like to go to Burger King , \u201d he told the three rotund conservatives .\nIn April 2011 , Ailes sent Fox News contributor Kathleen T. McFarland to Kabul to make a pitch to then-General David Petraeus . \u201c He adored Petraeus , \u201d a senior producer said . \u201c When Moveon.org put the \u2018 General Betray Us \u2019 ad in the newspapers in 2007 , Roger said it was treasonous and we reported it as such. \u201d Ailes had already told Petraeus that if he ran for president , he would quit Fox News to run the campaign . War hero presidents were especially impressive to Ailes . It was why he spoke almost daily to George H. W. Bush . \u201c The big boss is bankrolling it , \u201d McFarland told Petraeus , referring to Murdoch . \u201c Roger \u2019 s going to run it . And the rest of us are going to be your in-house. \u201d But Petraeus also turned Ailes down . \u201c It \u2019 s never going to happen , \u201d he told McFarland . \u201c My wife would divorce me . \u201d\nAround this time , Ailes set up a meeting with David and Charles Koch , the billionaire industrialists who were financing a phalanx of rightwing groups to defeat Obama . Ailes had never met the brothers , and both sides expressed that it would be a good moment to sit down . Charles Koch flew to New York for the meeting . But Ailes , for unclear reasons , canceled . \u201c Charles was miffed , \u201d one conservative familiar with the meeting explained . Perhaps Ailes recognized that if details of the gathering leaked it would further cement his image as a conservative kingmaker , a fact he was working overtime to dispel . \u201c Listen , the premise that I want to elect the next president is just bullshit , \u201d Ailes told a reporter . \u201c The idea that I \u2019 m grooming these Republicans is just wrong. \u201d Though the meeting was called off , Ailes \u2019 s interests were aligned with those of the Kochs . In the winter of 2011 , Ailes had called Chris Christie , the Kochs \u2019 preferred candidate , and implored him for a second time to run . Christie turned him down again .\nThe first Fox primary debate proceeded on May 5 , 2011 , in Greenville , South Carolina , without an A-list candidate . The aspirants on the stage were a bunch of also-rans : pizza mogul Herman Cain ; former governors Gary Johnson and Tim Pawlenty ; former senator Rick Santorum ; and Congressman Ron Paul . Ailes \u2019 s Washington managing editor , Bill Sammon , had assured Fox executives that bigger names would show up , but Sammon proved to be misinformed . The debate confirmed what a mess the field was\u2014a mess partly created by the loudmouths Ailes had given airtime to and a Tea Party he had nurtured .\nMeanwhile , Ailes had his hands all over the campaign in his backyard . It was also a mess . Democratic town supervisor Richard Shea was up for reelection in November 2011 . Ailes wanted him out . \u201c I still owe you one for that article , \u201d he told Shea , referring to his comments in The New York Times . Since the volatile town hall meeting on zoning , their relationship had settled into a stalemate . But a few months before the election , Ailes asked Shea to meet him at the PCN & R office on Main Street . \u201c What you should do is hire an opponent to run against you and then you win , \u201d Ailes said . Shea later told others he wondered if Ailes was secretly taping him to set him up .\nThe campaign season was unlike any the community had seen . The Ailes-backed conservative candidate , Lee Erickson , who owned a well-drilling business in town , sent out nearly a dozen high-gloss mailers to voters and conducted telephone push polls against Shea . Then , in October , Erickson refused to attend a debate that Gordon Stewart and Philipstown.info were organizing at the Haldane School . Stewart even promised to publish the website \u2019 s questions in advance , but Erickson was unswayed .\n\u201c Oh , I sent that out to everyone , \u201d Roger said , and smirked .\nAfter Beth gave opening remarks to the crowd of 150 , Joe Lindsley \u2019 s replacement , Doug Cunningham , moderated . Over the course of the debate , Erickson hurled Ailesian putdowns . He called Shea \u201c King Richard \u201d and criticized his \u201c disappointing level of arrogance. \u201d Erickson , who had cofounded the property rights group Citizens of Philipstown , mainly went after Shea \u2019 s zoning legislation . Shea remained unflappable . \u201c One of the things I \u2019 m most proud of is the zoning , \u201d he said . Instead , Shea accused Erickson of distorting his positions . He said his opponent \u201c went up and down [ Route ] 9 spreading a campaign of disinformation to business owners , riling people up . \u201d\nThe consensus in town was that Shea dominated Erickson that night . On Election Day , after an Erickson supporter went up and down Main Street in colonial garb stumping for his candidate , Shea won decisively by 518 votes , or 58.8 percent of the vote to 41.2 percent for Erickson . It should have been an augur of things to come . The PCN & R succeeded in monopolizing access to Philipstown Republicans , but failed to get Erickson into office . The same dynamic was about to play out on the national stage .\nRepublicans referred to the 2012 campaign as the \u201c Fox News Primary. \u201d \u201c It \u2019 s like a town hall every day on Fox News , \u201d Kansas governor Sam Brownback told The New York Times not long before the Iowa caucuses . \u201c I like Fox , and I \u2019 m glad we have an outlet , but it is having a major , major effect on what happens. \u201d For both the candidates and Ailes , the Fox Primary was a ratings boon but a branding challenge . In the last eight months of 2011 , GOP presidential candidates made more than six hundred appearances on Fox News and Fox Business while largely ignoring non-Fox media . ( \u201c I \u2019 m sorry , we \u2019 re only going to be doing Fox , \u201d Gingrich \u2019 s spokesperson , R. C. Hammond , told a CNN producer on the eve of the Iowa caucuses in Des Moines . ) Their face time on Fox during this period totaled seventy-seven hours and twenty-four minutes . But as Fox \u2019 s pundits and anchors pushed the candidates into the conspiracy swamps of Fast and Furious , the gun-running debacle , and Solyndra , the bankrupt solar panel company , Fox risked alienating independent viewers\u2014and voters .\nIt was a case of Ailes being unable to put his party \u2019 s goal of winning independents ahead of his personal views . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t like green energy\u2014 period , \u201d a senior producer said . \u201c He says all the time that no one in America has died from nuclear power , but fifteen people have been chopped up by those damn windmills. \u201d For Ailes , Fast and Furious was a passionate cause . \u201c He wants indictments . He thinks [ Attorney General Eric ] Holder should resign and go to jail for the death of a federal agent . He won \u2019 t be happy until he gets it , \u201d the producer said .\nBranding issues aside , the Fox Primary was a cunning programming ploy . It gave Ailes \u2019 s audience a new reality TV show with a revolving cast of characters to follow . In May 2011 , Mike Huckabee ginned up interest in his weekly Fox show by promising to reveal his presidential ambitions live . \u201c Governor Huckabee will announce tomorrow night on his program whether or not he intends to explore a presidential bid , \u201d his producer , Woody Fraser , teased in a press release . \u201c He has not told anyone at Fox News Channel his decision. \u201d On the night of May 14 , when Huckabee announced he was not running , ratings soared to 2.2 million .\nBut when the action took place off his set , Ailes , like any director , went wild . In October , Sarah Palin made the mistake of breaking the news that she would not be running for president on Mark Levin \u2019 s talk radio show . \u201c I paid her for two years to make this announcement on my network , \u201d Ailes told Bill Shine in a meeting . Fox was left with sloppy seconds : a follow-up interview with Palin on Greta Van Susteren \u2019 s 10:00 p.m. show , after news of Palin \u2019 s decision had been drowned out by Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs \u2019 s death . Ailes was so furious that he considered pulling Palin off Fox entirely until her $ 1 million annual contract expired in 2013 . Shine told Palin \u2019 s agent , Bob Barnett , that Palin was at risk of being \u201c benched. \u201d After conferring with Palin , Barnett called Shine back and told him that Palin recognized the misstep . But tensions between Palin and Fox did not subside .\nAiles questioned the spine of the eventual nominee , Mitt Romney . In a private conversation with Bill Kristol , Ailes said , \u201c Romney \u2019 s got ta rip Obama \u2019 s face off . It \u2019 s really hard to do . I did this with Bush Sr . He was uncomfortable with ripping Dukakis \u2019 s face off . George had to tell Barbara , \u2018 Look , this is Roger \u2019 s thing. \u2019 It made Barbara uncomfortable that George was going so negative , but I had to rip off Dukakis \u2019 s face . \u201d\nRomney \u2019 s shaky interview with Bret Baier on the afternoon of November 29 proved Ailes \u2019 s point . For days , Romney had been declining invitations to appear with a roundtable of \u201c All-Star \u201d pundits . Romney \u2019 s campaign did not think it would look \u201c presidential \u201d for the candidate to be surrounded by Fox News commentators lobbing questions at him . Finally , they reached a compromise . Bret Baier would interview Romney at a Conchita Foods warehouse in Miami , where the candidate was on the trail . But just because Baier agreed to travel to Florida did not mean he was going to go soft . After rattling off a list of Romney \u2019 s flip-flops on climate change , gay marriage , abortion , and immigration , Baier confronted Romney about his position on universal health care . \u201c Do you believe that that was the right thing for Massachusetts ? \u201d\n\u201c Bret , I don \u2019 t know how many hundred times I \u2019 ve said this\u2014 \u201d Romney stammered . \u201c This is an unusual interview. \u201d The back-and-forth continued for several excruciating minutes .\nWhen the cameras cut out , Romney complained to Baier about the exchange . Not coming prepared had been Romney \u2019 s first mistake . Insulting Baier was his second . The following night , Baier appeared on The O \u2019 Reilly Factor and reported Romney \u2019 s off-camera tantrum .\nAt times , it seemed that Ailes was using Fox to manufacture moments of excitement around alternative candidates . After receiving just 9.4 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary , Newt Gingrich bounced back in South Carolina . His springboard was a fiery on-air exchange with Fox analyst Juan Williams at a debate in Myrtle Beach held on Martin Luther King Day . Williams , who is black , asked Gingrich about his campaign trail comments that inner city children lacked a \u201c work ethic \u201d and should work as \u201c janitors \u201d in schools . Weren \u2019 t these remarks \u201c insulting to all Americans but particularly to black Americans \u201d ? \u201c No , \u201d Gingrich shot back . His answer was greeted with rapturous applause . \u201c Only the elites despise earning money , \u201d he said . Gingrich carried the state \u2019 s primary five days later .\nSome in Romney \u2019 s camp blamed the outcome on Ailes . Stuart Stevens , Romney \u2019 s media strategist , later told Romney \u2019 s advisers that he thought Ailes put a black newsman onstage as a way of symbolically putting Obama in a room filled mainly with white conservatives . Gingrich \u2019 s defiant retort , red meat in the cradle of Dixie , was a symbolic smackdown of the president .\nIn one editorial meeting , Fox News executive Suzanne Scott wondered aloud if Ailes was damaging the party by stoking on-air death matches . \u201c You can create a Reagan through an intra-party fight , \u201d Ailes responded . \u201c If there \u2019 s a fight , we should be the one doing the shooting . \u201d\nBy any measure , 2012 was shaping up to be a phenomenal year for Ailes : Fox News was on track to make $ 1 billion in profit , the network was in the driver \u2019 s seat during the fractious Republican primary , and it still was crushing its cable news rivals . And yet , to some who knew him , Ailes seemed to be consumed by increasingly paranoid and morbid thoughts .\n\u201c Listen , one out of every twenty-five people in America is a psychopath , \u201d he told his executives . Petty grievances and past battles triggered outsized responses .\nIn the fall of 2011 , Ailes found himself in a row with Google after the company co-sponsored a GOP debate with Fox at the Orlando Convention Center in Florida . Michael Clemente had worked hard to develop the relationship with the Internet search giant , but the relationship did not last long . Ailes was furious that the third hit in search results for his name was a liberal blog called rogerailes.blogspot.com ( \u201c Not affiliated with the fat FOX fuck , \u201d the blog informed readers at the top of its homepage ) . Ailes told Fox executives that he wanted Google to push the blog \u2019 s ranking down . Google told Fox that they did not intervene in such matters . Afterward , Fox canceled the partnership and did not co-host future debates with Google .\nAiles spoke frequently about death . \u201c I \u2019 d give anything for another ten years , \u201d Ailes would say . Having a child amplified these sentiments . \u201c I don \u2019 t want the kid growin \u2019 up in a fouled-up world , \u201d he told a reporter . \u201c He has common feelings of a parent who wants to protect a son , \u201d a close colleague said . \u201c The thing is , most parents don \u2019 t run a television network. \u201d To prepare Zachary for his absence , he gave him an accelerated education . When Zachary was twelve , Roger set up a summer internship for him at the Manhattan-based PR firm the Dilenschneider Group , whose founder , Robert Dilenschneider , was Ailes \u2019 s personal PR consultant . Each morning , Zachary would put on a coat and tie and get driven in Roger \u2019 s News Corp SUV to the office . Around this time , Roger told a journalist that he set aside boxes filled with keepsakes . Besides family photographs and letters , the contents included a pocket-size copy of the Constitution ( \u201c The founders believed it and so should you , \u201d he wrote on it ) , press clippings lionizing his accomplishments , some gold coins ( \u201c in case everything goes to hell \u201d ) , and Sun Tzu \u2019 s `` The Art of War , '' with a note inscribed on the opening page :\nAvoid war if at all possible but never give up your freedom\u2014or your honor . Always stand for what is right . If absolutely FORCED to fight , then fight with courage and win . Don \u2019 t try to win . . . win ! Love ,\nBut there was more on his mind than his own mortality . He sometimes feared the worst for Zachary . In February 2012 , Gordon Stewart received an unexpected , hysterical call from Ailes .\n\u201c You \u2019 re putting a target on my son \u2019 s back ! \u201d he screamed . \u201c You \u2019 ll be responsible if something happens ! \u201d\nStewart , who had to hold the phone away from his ear , asked Ailes what on earth he was talking about .\nThat week , Philipstown.info published a brief item about recent hearings of the local planning board . The final paragraph reported that Ailes and his neighbor were seeking approval to adjust the line between their properties , which were owned by \u201c Hudson Valley 2009 , formed by Roger Ailes ; Viewsave LLC ; and Gerald Morris . \u201d\nThe article , he said , put Zachary in danger because it disclosed the existence of a trust . He began fulminating about unrelated disputes , including the old charge that Stewart encouraged his employees to quit without giving notice . \u201c You must know I did no such thing , \u201d Stewart said .\n\u201c Roger , since you called and I said hello , you have insulted my integrity , called me a liar to my face , have threatened me with a lawsuit , accused me of potentially being an accomplice to the murder of your son , \u201d Stewart said . \u201c Can you explain to me how you can expect that approach will advance the purpose of your calling ? \u201d\nAiles paused . \u201c You need to get help ! \u201d he blurted out and hung up .\nAn hour later , Ailes called back . This time , he calmly asked Stewart to take down the article from the website . Stewart told him he would get back to him . After discussing his concerns with his editor , Kevin Foley , and the reporter on the story , Stewart called Ailes and informed him that he would not be removing it .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t know how people are out to get me ! I asked you for a favor and you \u2019 re turning me down . \u201d\n\u201c First of all , \u201d Stewart said , \u201c there \u2019 s no mention of your son . There \u2019 s nothing in this article that would jeopardize you and your family . You \u2019 re asking me to remove what happened at a public meeting , and I can \u2019 t do that . \u201d\nAiles repeated his claim that Stewart needed mental help . The conversation ended there . At home that night , Stewart \u2019 s cell phone rang . It was Ailes calling for the third time that day . Stewart didn \u2019 t pick up .\nLater that month , Ailes \u2019 s old nemesis David Brock coauthored a new book , `` The Fox Effect : How Roger Ailes Turned a Network Into a Propaganda Machine , '' which synthesized the most damaging research that Media Matters had published over the past decade on its website . \u201c He was obsessed with Brock \u2019 s book , \u201d one Fox contributor recalled . In one meeting , Ailes said he couldn \u2019 t \u201c do anything \u201d until it was published . Highlighting leaked emails from Fox executives , which expressed overt right-wing bias , and detailing wild on-air claims about Obama \u2019 s religion , background , and policies , the text provided Fox \u2019 s detractors with rounds of ammunition to deploy in their battle to define Ailes as a master propagandist . In retaliation , Fox aired segments claiming Brock was mentally unstable .\nGoogle , Media Matters , and Philipstown.info were new media antagonists . Ailes \u2019 s threats did not have the same effect on them that they did on legacy media outlets . This was especially the case with Gawker . On April 10 , the gossip website introduced a new series . \u201c What follows is the inaugural column of a person we are calling The Fox Mole\u2014a long-standing , current employee of Fox News Channel who will be providing Gawker with regular dispatches from inside the organization , \u201d the editors wrote . The columns brought about a minor media convulsion , but the show had a short run . Within twenty-four hours , Fox executives successfully identified the Mole as Joe Muto , a thirty-year-old associate producer who \u2019 d worked at the network for eight years , and fired him .\nWhen Muto quickly landed a low-six-figure book deal in early May to write about his exploits , Ailes decided to send a message . Jimmy Gildea , Ailes \u2019 s security guard , told the boss he could press charges . \u201c If this Gawker paid for stolen goods , it could be part of the crime , same as if somebody hires a hit man , \u201d the former cop said . Brian Lewis wanted Ailes to let it go , but was overruled . \u201c I told them , \u201d Lewis said , \u201c but I was told that legal would be handling this from here forward . I \u2019 m like , Okay . \u201d\nAt 6:30 in the morning on April 25 , officers from the New York district attorney \u2019 s office arrived at Muto \u2019 s apartment with a warrant charging him with grand larceny and conspiracy , among other charges . They seized his iPhone , laptop , and old notebooks . A year later , a month before his book was published , Muto appeared in handcuffs at the Manhattan Criminal Court , where he pleaded guilty to a pair of misdemeanor charges : attempted unlawful duplication and criminal possession of computer-related material . The judge fined Muto $ 1,000 , ordered him to forfeit a $ 5,000 fee he earned from Gawker for reporting on Fox , confiscated his Mac , and ordered him to do ten days of community service and two hundred hours of private service .\nIn the closing weeks of the 2012 presidential campaign , Ailes \u2019 s worldview radiated from his daily editorial meetings onto the screen . \u201c He likes to raise questions in chyrons , \u201d a senior producer said , referring to the graphics and the text that appear at the bottom of the screen . \u201c Is Obama a socialist ? He tells producers that such an approach is better than simply saying Obama is a socialist. \u201d Ailes \u2019 s anchors and pundits breathlessly inflated a panoply of administration blunders into full-blown conspiracies . While Fox reporters did some enterprising coverage of the deadly attack on the American consulate in Benghazi on September 11 , 2012 , the journalism was undermined by one host claiming it was \u201c the biggest news story since Watergate. \u201d A few days before the election , the mother of Sean Patrick Smith , a State Department employee killed in Benghazi , said that Fox \u2019 s reports had caused her to believe that \u201c Obama murdered my son. \u201d Fox hyped the influence of fringe groups like the New Black Panther Party and pushed fears of stolen elections . \u201c ELECTION OFFICIALS IN BATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO FEAR WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD , \u201d one on-screen banner read .\nAiles \u2019 s executives flattered him with suggestions that he go on camera and deliver the attack lines himself or even run for president . ( Michael Clemente had \u201c Ailes 2012 \u201d bumper stickers printed and distributed around the second floor . ) At some moments , Ailes demurred . \u201c Those days are gone , \u201d he told his team . At other moments , he indulged them . That summer , he told his inner circle at the afternoon strategy meeting that he wanted to host a talk show . His PR deputy , Irena Briganti , who was sitting in the room , advised him against it . \u201c The media will go after you , \u201d she warned .\nSo when Ailes wanted to get his message out , he often turned to his lawyer , Peter Johnson Jr. , who took to Fox & Friends to spread it . In private , Johnson spoke of Ailes like a father . Johnson told a Fox colleague Ailes thought of him as a son . Owing to his special status , Johnson was allowed to use the teleprompter to read from scripts , a perk that was normally reserved for Fox hosts . \u201c He can load a script directly into the teleprompter . So it \u2019 s not even Ailes unplugged . It \u2019 s Ailes plugged in , \u201d one person familiar with the matter said . Johnson served up frightening scenarios filled with Muslim extremists and Occupy Wall Street anarchists and overreaching government bureaucrats , lacing his commentary with Nixonian bogeymen . On the day before Obama and Romney squared off in their final debate on foreign policy , Johnson discussed the situation in Benghazi . He speculated about whether Obama had known about the attack early enough to have ordered military action to save the Americans who were killed . \u201c If he did nothing , then that is the shame of America , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c I have no evidence for this , \u201d he mused , but \u201c were these people expendable as part of a Mideast foreign policy ? \u201d\nOn the afternoon of November 6\u2014Election Day\u2014Ailes had lunch with Karl Rove , who still believed in a Romney win . Few Fox pundits had stumped as hard as Rove had for the candidate . Rove \u2019 s Super PAC , American Crossroads , and its affiliate , Crossroads GPS , had vowed to spend up to $ 300 million to back conservatives in the 2012 political campaigns . \u201c Hell , maybe Karl \u2019 s right , \u201d Ailes said later that day .\nAt 5:00 p.m. , Ailes assembled his network \u2019 s election team in the second-floor conference room to discuss the night \u2019 s coverage . \u201c Guys , \u201d he told them , \u201c no matter how it goes , don \u2019 t go out there looking like someone ran over your dog. \u201d But as Fox \u2019 s exit poll team presented the numbers , Ailes came undone . \u201c They weren \u2019 t good for Romney , \u201d a person in the room said . \u201c Roger started arguing about how the sample skewed toward liberals. \u201d Ailes said , \u201c Liberals like to share their feelings , and conservatives work , so they don \u2019 t vote until later. \u201d Arnon Mishkin , the head of Fox \u2019 s decision desk team , told Ailes that the data accounted for a sample skew . It appeared that Romney was going to be trounced . Worse , so-called late deciders were breaking for Obama .\n\u201c Thank you , Chris Christie , \u201d Ailes grumbled . He was still furious that Christie had given Obama a bipartisan photo op on the New Jersey coastline after Hurricane Sandy .\n\u201c Actually , that \u2019 s not true , \u201d Mishkin said . \u201c We asked people that . There \u2019 s no data in the polling to suggest that Sandy hurt Romney . \u201d\n\u201c Well , hugging the guy couldn \u2019 t help people feel good about Romney either , \u201d Ailes countered .\nData was no substitute for what his gut told him . \u201c Everyone left that room with the knowledge that Roger didn \u2019 t believe the polls , \u201d a participant said . His opinion would be channeled on-air later that night , with embarrassing consequences .\nAbout an hour later , Ailes settled into a plush chair in the Fox Sports Suite . A couple hundred people , including Rupert Murdoch , mingled in the room snacking on sushi and lamb kabobs . One Fox executive recalled he made sure to avoid eating the raw fish in front of Ailes . \u201c Sushi is liberal food , \u201d he explained . The election coverage played out on eight flat-screen televisions mounted on the wall . Around 8:00 , Beth arrived . The PCN & R was going to press that night . She sat beside Ailes reviewing the week \u2019 s edition on her iPad . Shortly before 11:00 , with Romney \u2019 s chances fading , Roger and Beth called it a night . \u201c I want to kiss Zac good night before he goes to sleep , \u201d Ailes told a journalist , trying to put the best spin on the outcome . \u201c If Romney wins , it \u2019 s good for the taxpayers . If Obama wins , it \u2019 s great for our ratings . \u201d\nDownstairs , Arnon Mishkin and Fox \u2019 s number crunchers were preparing to call Ohio for Obama . \u201c Let \u2019 s remember this is Fox News calling Ohio . This will say something beyond Ohio going for Obama , \u201d Mishkin told Fox brass . Fox executives told Mishkin to get the numbers right and ignore the politics : \u201c If we think Ohio has gone Obama , we call Ohio , \u201d said a Fox News executive .\nBret Baier announced the call on set . \u201c That \u2019 s the presidency , essentially , \u201d he said . Instantly , Fox phones lit up with angry phone calls and emails from the Romney campaign , who believed that the call was premature . After Baier \u2019 s Ohio call , Rove took their complaints public , echoing Ailes \u2019 s earlier comments , and conducting an on-air primer on Ohio \u2019 s electoral math to dispute the outcome . With the network divided against itself , senior producers held a meeting to adjudicate . The decision desk stood their ground . They knew how momentous the call was . In the end , producers had to find a way to split the difference . Megyn Kelly walked through the newsroom to interview the decision desk . \u201c This is Fox News , \u201d a person in the room said , \u201c so anytime there \u2019 s a chance to show off Megyn Kelly \u2019 s legs they \u2019 ll go for it . \u201d\nBy midnight , Rove reluctantly seemed to concede . The moment became a symbol of the denialism that had taken hold on the right in the closing days of the election . On air , Dick Morris had predicted a Romney landslide , putting Romney \u2019 s odds of winning at 90 percent . In private , some Fox staffers thought the network \u2019 s boosterism had become a joke . At a rehearsal on the Saturday before the election , Megyn Kelly chuckled when she relayed to colleagues what someone had told her : \u201c I really like Dick Morris . He \u2019 s always wrong , but he makes me feel good . \u201d\nOnly half of Roger Ailes \u2019 s grand plan had come to pass . While Fox \u2019 s ratings were still unchallenged , the channel had failed to elect the next president\u2014the circus on Fox had complicated the effort as well as assisted it . By giving airtime to the most outlandish voices on the right , Fox had helped distort the debate over the country \u2019 s future , making it easier for voters to dismiss Republican arguments . Ailes \u2019 s personal political impulses\u2014to enlist Chris Christie , or David Petraeus\u2014were at odds with the vivid political comedy Fox often programmed . It turned out that television and politics were different disciplines . In pursuit of ratings , Fox had sharpened national divisions\u2014and the division had favored the Democrats . Since the Nixon administration and TVN , the right had dreamed of a television channel that could make its case with the American public , to balance the debate . \u201c You \u2019 re a hero to our people , \u201d one prominent conservative told Ailes at a gala at the Kennedy Center . But in 2012 , by this measure , Fox had been a failure .\nAfter Mitt Romney \u2019 s 2012 defeat , Mark Rozell , the acting dean of the George Mason University School of Public Policy , and Paul Goldman , a former chairman of Virginia \u2019 s Democratic Party , wrote an essay noting the inverse relationship between the rise of conservative media and the Republican Party \u2019 s ability to win national majorities . \u201c When the mainstream media reigned supreme , between 1952 and 1988 , Republicans won seven out of the ten presidential elections , \u201d they reported . \u201c Conservative talk show hosts and Fox News blame the \u2018 lamestream \u2019 national media \u2019 s \u2018 liberal bias \u2019 for the GOP \u2019 s poor showing since 1992 . Yet the rise of the conservative-dominated media defines the era when the fortunes of GOP presidential hopefuls dropped to the worst levels since the party \u2019 s founding in 1856. \u201d Perhaps the freak show had become too freakish .\nExcerpted from `` The Loudest Voice in the Room : How the Brilliant , Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News -- and Divided a Country , '' by Gabriel Sherman .

    "content_original": "By the time of Glenn Beck\u2019s departure from Fox News in 2011, Roger Ailes had been spending considerable energy discussing the consequences of an Obama reelection. For the past two and a half years, he had committed himself to blocking the Obama agenda. When the Affordable Care Act passed the previous March, \u201che went apeshit,\u201d a senior producer said. Ailes instructed his producers to book former New York lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey, a conservative health care advocate who popularized the notion of \u201cdeath panels.\u201d \u201cHe said she was the best person to talk about this,\u201d the senior producer recalled. \u201cHe even gave her a prop: a giant stack of papers of the law itself.\u201d\n\nAnd so Ailes set out to recruit a viable Republican candidate. In the summer of 2010, he invited Chris Christie to dinner at his home in Garrison with Rush Limbaugh. Like much of the GOP establishment, Ailes fell hard for the New Jersey governor. They talked about pension reform and getting tough with the unions. Ailes saw in Christie a great candidate: an ordinary guy, someone you\u2019d be comfortable talking to over your back fence. But Ailes may have seen something else. Christie had Fox News television values with a ready-made reel. And, of course, Obama versus Christie was a producer\u2019s dream: black versus white, thin versus fat, professor versus prosecutor. Maybe, just maybe, Ailes could laugh all the way to the White House and the bank. Nevertheless, Christie politely turned down Ailes\u2019s calls to run. Christie joked at dinner that his weight was an issue. \u201cI still like to go to Burger King,\u201d he told the three rotund conservatives.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn April 2011, Ailes sent Fox News contributor Kathleen T. McFarland to Kabul to make a pitch to then-General David Petraeus. \u201cHe adored Petraeus,\u201d a senior producer said. \u201cWhen Moveon.org put the \u2018General Betray Us\u2019 ad in the newspapers in 2007, Roger said it was treasonous and we reported it as such.\u201d Ailes had already told Petraeus that if he ran for president, he would quit Fox News to run the campaign. War hero presidents were especially impressive to Ailes. It was why he spoke almost daily to George H. W. Bush. \u201cThe big boss is bankrolling it,\u201d McFarland told Petraeus, referring to Murdoch. \u201cRoger\u2019s going to run it. And the rest of us are going to be your in-house.\u201d But Petraeus also turned Ailes down. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d he told McFarland. \u201cMy wife would divorce me.\u201d\n\nAround this time, Ailes set up a meeting with David and Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialists who were financing a phalanx of rightwing groups to defeat Obama. Ailes had never met the brothers, and both sides expressed that it would be a good moment to sit down. Charles Koch flew to New York for the meeting. But Ailes, for unclear reasons, canceled. \u201cCharles was miffed,\u201d one conservative familiar with the meeting explained. Perhaps Ailes recognized that if details of the gathering leaked it would further cement his image as a conservative kingmaker, a fact he was working overtime to dispel. \u201cListen, the premise that I want to elect the next president is just bullshit,\u201d Ailes told a reporter. \u201cThe idea that I\u2019m grooming these Republicans is just wrong.\u201d Though the meeting was called off, Ailes\u2019s interests were aligned with those of the Kochs. In the winter of 2011, Ailes had called Chris Christie, the Kochs\u2019 preferred candidate, and implored him for a second time to run. Christie turned him down again.\n\nThe first Fox primary debate proceeded on May 5, 2011, in Greenville, South Carolina, without an A-list candidate. The aspirants on the stage were a bunch of also-rans: pizza mogul Herman Cain; former governors Gary Johnson and Tim Pawlenty; former senator Rick Santorum; and Congressman Ron Paul. Ailes\u2019s Washington managing editor, Bill Sammon, had assured Fox executives that bigger names would show up, but Sammon proved to be misinformed. The debate confirmed what a mess the field was\u2014a mess partly created by the loudmouths Ailes had given airtime to and a Tea Party he had nurtured.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMeanwhile, Ailes had his hands all over the campaign in his backyard. It was also a mess. Democratic town supervisor Richard Shea was up for reelection in November 2011. Ailes wanted him out. \u201cI still owe you one for that article,\u201d he told Shea, referring to his comments in The New York Times. Since the volatile town hall meeting on zoning, their relationship had settled into a stalemate. But a few months before the election, Ailes asked Shea to meet him at the PCN&R office on Main Street. \u201cWhat you should do is hire an opponent to run against you and then you win,\u201d Ailes said. Shea later told others he wondered if Ailes was secretly taping him to set him up.\n\nThe campaign season was unlike any the community had seen. The Ailes-backed conservative candidate, Lee Erickson, who owned a well-drilling business in town, sent out nearly a dozen high-gloss mailers to voters and conducted telephone push polls against Shea. Then, in October, Erickson refused to attend a debate that Gordon Stewart and Philipstown.info were organizing at the Haldane School. Stewart even promised to publish the website\u2019s questions in advance, but Erickson was unswayed.\n\nOn the day of the PCN&R debate, Ailes engaged in a bit of psychological warfare. The latest issue of Newsmax magazine had a cover story about Ailes, calling him \u201cThe Most Powerful Man in News.\u201d That day, several local politicians, including Shea, received hand-delivered copies of the issue, with candy-colored tabs affixed to the pages of the glowing profile. \u201cUsing his instincts about on-air talent and the assault on American values, Roger Ailes has set the new agenda for TV journalism. But he\u2019s decidedly not the kind of media mogul described by his liberal critics,\u201d the article read. The text seemed tailor-made to rebut a series of articles about Ailes that had recently appeared in national magazines. Ailes had included personal notes with the magazine, at least one of which read, \u201cBe careful what you say about my wife.\u201d That night at the Haldane cafeteria, Shea was overheard asking Ailes about the Newsmax story and his note: \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cOh, I sent that out to everyone,\u201d Roger said, and smirked.\n\nAfter Beth gave opening remarks to the crowd of 150, Joe Lindsley\u2019s replacement, Doug Cunningham, moderated. Over the course of the debate, Erickson hurled Ailesian putdowns. He called Shea \u201cKing Richard\u201d and criticized his \u201cdisappointing level of arrogance.\u201d Erickson, who had cofounded the property rights group Citizens of Philipstown, mainly went after Shea\u2019s zoning legislation. Shea remained unflappable. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m most proud of is the zoning,\u201d he said. Instead, Shea accused Erickson of distorting his positions. He said his opponent \u201cwent up and down [Route] 9 spreading a campaign of disinformation to business owners, riling people up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe consensus in town was that Shea dominated Erickson that night. On Election Day, after an Erickson supporter went up and down Main Street in colonial garb stumping for his candidate, Shea won decisively by 518 votes, or 58.8 percent of the vote to 41.2 percent for Erickson. It should have been an augur of things to come. The PCN&R succeeded in monopolizing access to Philipstown Republicans, but failed to get Erickson into office. The same dynamic was about to play out on the national stage.\n\nRepublicans referred to the 2012 campaign as the \u201cFox News Primary.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like a town hall every day on Fox News,\u201d Kansas governor Sam Brownback told The New York Times not long before the Iowa caucuses. \u201cI like Fox, and I\u2019m glad we have an outlet, but it is having a major, major effect on what happens.\u201d For both the candidates and Ailes, the Fox Primary was a ratings boon but a branding challenge. In the last eight months of 2011, GOP presidential candidates made more than six hundred appearances on Fox News and Fox Business while largely ignoring non-Fox media. (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re only going to be doing Fox,\u201d Gingrich\u2019s spokesperson, R. C. Hammond, told a CNN producer on the eve of the Iowa caucuses in Des Moines.) Their face time on Fox during this period totaled seventy-seven hours and twenty-four minutes. But as Fox\u2019s pundits and anchors pushed the candidates into the conspiracy swamps of Fast and Furious, the gun-running debacle, and Solyndra, the bankrupt solar panel company, Fox risked alienating independent viewers\u2014and voters.\n\nIt was a case of Ailes being unable to put his party\u2019s goal of winning independents ahead of his personal views. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like green energy\u2014 period,\u201d a senior producer said. \u201cHe says all the time that no one in America has died from nuclear power, but fifteen people have been chopped up by those damn windmills.\u201d For Ailes, Fast and Furious was a passionate cause. \u201cHe wants indictments. He thinks [Attorney General Eric] Holder should resign and go to jail for the death of a federal agent. He won\u2019t be happy until he gets it,\u201d the producer said.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBranding issues aside, the Fox Primary was a cunning programming ploy. It gave Ailes\u2019s audience a new reality TV show with a revolving cast of characters to follow. In May 2011, Mike Huckabee ginned up interest in his weekly Fox show by promising to reveal his presidential ambitions live. \u201cGovernor Huckabee will announce tomorrow night on his program whether or not he intends to explore a presidential bid,\u201d his producer, Woody Fraser, teased in a press release. \u201cHe has not told anyone at Fox News Channel his decision.\u201d On the night of May 14, when Huckabee announced he was not running, ratings soared to 2.2 million.\n\nBut when the action took place off his set, Ailes, like any director, went wild. In October, Sarah Palin made the mistake of breaking the news that she would not be running for president on Mark Levin\u2019s talk radio show. \u201cI paid her for two years to make this announcement on my network,\u201d Ailes told Bill Shine in a meeting. Fox was left with sloppy seconds: a follow-up interview with Palin on Greta Van Susteren\u2019s 10:00 p.m. show, after news of Palin\u2019s decision had been drowned out by Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs\u2019s death. Ailes was so furious that he considered pulling Palin off Fox entirely until her $1 million annual contract expired in 2013. Shine told Palin\u2019s agent, Bob Barnett, that Palin was at risk of being \u201cbenched.\u201d After conferring with Palin, Barnett called Shine back and told him that Palin recognized the misstep. But tensions between Palin and Fox did not subside.\n\nAiles questioned the spine of the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. In a private conversation with Bill Kristol, Ailes said, \u201cRomney\u2019s gotta rip Obama\u2019s face off. It\u2019s really hard to do. I did this with Bush Sr. He was uncomfortable with ripping Dukakis\u2019s face off. George had to tell Barbara, \u2018Look, this is Roger\u2019s thing.\u2019 It made Barbara uncomfortable that George was going so negative, but I had to rip off Dukakis\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRomney\u2019s shaky interview with Bret Baier on the afternoon of November 29 proved Ailes\u2019s point. For days, Romney had been declining invitations to appear with a roundtable of \u201cAll-Star\u201d pundits. Romney\u2019s campaign did not think it would look \u201cpresidential\u201d for the candidate to be surrounded by Fox News commentators lobbing questions at him. Finally, they reached a compromise. Bret Baier would interview Romney at a Conchita Foods warehouse in Miami, where the candidate was on the trail. But just because Baier agreed to travel to Florida did not mean he was going to go soft. After rattling off a list of Romney\u2019s flip-flops on climate change, gay marriage, abortion, and immigration, Baier confronted Romney about his position on universal health care. \u201cDo you believe that that was the right thing for Massachusetts?\u201d\n\n\u201cBret, I don\u2019t know how many hundred times I\u2019ve said this\u2014\u201d Romney stammered. \u201cThis is an unusual interview.\u201d The back-and-forth continued for several excruciating minutes.\n\nWhen the cameras cut out, Romney complained to Baier about the exchange. Not coming prepared had been Romney\u2019s first mistake. Insulting Baier was his second. The following night, Baier appeared on The O\u2019Reilly Factor and reported Romney\u2019s off-camera tantrum.\n\nAt times, it seemed that Ailes was using Fox to manufacture moments of excitement around alternative candidates. After receiving just 9.4 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, Newt Gingrich bounced back in South Carolina. His springboard was a fiery on-air exchange with Fox analyst Juan Williams at a debate in Myrtle Beach held on Martin Luther King Day. Williams, who is black, asked Gingrich about his campaign trail comments that inner city children lacked a \u201cwork ethic\u201d and should work as \u201cjanitors\u201d in schools. Weren\u2019t these remarks \u201cinsulting to all Americans but particularly to black Americans\u201d? \u201cNo,\u201d Gingrich shot back. His answer was greeted with rapturous applause. \u201cOnly the elites despise earning money,\u201d he said. Gingrich carried the state\u2019s primary five days later.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSome in Romney\u2019s camp blamed the outcome on Ailes. Stuart Stevens, Romney\u2019s media strategist, later told Romney\u2019s advisers that he thought Ailes put a black newsman onstage as a way of symbolically putting Obama in a room filled mainly with white conservatives. Gingrich\u2019s defiant retort, red meat in the cradle of Dixie, was a symbolic smackdown of the president.\n\nIn one editorial meeting, Fox News executive Suzanne Scott wondered aloud if Ailes was damaging the party by stoking on-air death matches. \u201cYou can create a Reagan through an intra-party fight,\u201d Ailes responded. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fight, we should be the one doing the shooting.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, 2012 was shaping up to be a phenomenal year for Ailes: Fox News was on track to make $1 billion in profit, the network was in the driver\u2019s seat during the fractious Republican primary, and it still was crushing its cable news rivals. And yet, to some who knew him, Ailes seemed to be consumed by increasingly paranoid and morbid thoughts.\n\n\u201cListen, one out of every twenty-five people in America is a psychopath,\u201d he told his executives. Petty grievances and past battles triggered outsized responses.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Ailes found himself in a row with Google after the company co-sponsored a GOP debate with Fox at the Orlando Convention Center in Florida. Michael Clemente had worked hard to develop the relationship with the Internet search giant, but the relationship did not last long. Ailes was furious that the third hit in search results for his name was a liberal blog called rogerailes.blogspot.com (\u201cNot affiliated with the fat FOX fuck,\u201d the blog informed readers at the top of its homepage). Ailes told Fox executives that he wanted Google to push the blog\u2019s ranking down. Google told Fox that they did not intervene in such matters. Afterward, Fox canceled the partnership and did not co-host future debates with Google.\n\nAiles spoke frequently about death. \u201cI\u2019d give anything for another ten years,\u201d Ailes would say. Having a child amplified these sentiments. \u201cI don\u2019t want the kid growin\u2019 up in a fouled-up world,\u201d he told a reporter. \u201cHe has common feelings of a parent who wants to protect a son,\u201d a close colleague said. \u201cThe thing is, most parents don\u2019t run a television network.\u201d To prepare Zachary for his absence, he gave him an accelerated education. When Zachary was twelve, Roger set up a summer internship for him at the Manhattan-based PR firm the Dilenschneider Group, whose founder, Robert Dilenschneider, was Ailes\u2019s personal PR consultant. Each morning, Zachary would put on a coat and tie and get driven in Roger\u2019s News Corp SUV to the office. Around this time, Roger told a journalist that he set aside boxes filled with keepsakes. Besides family photographs and letters, the contents included a pocket-size copy of the Constitution (\u201cThe founders believed it and so should you,\u201d he wrote on it), press clippings lionizing his accomplishments, some gold coins (\u201cin case everything goes to hell\u201d), and Sun Tzu\u2019s \"The Art of War,\" with a note inscribed on the opening page:\n\nAvoid war if at all possible but never give up your freedom\u2014or your honor. Always stand for what is right. If absolutely FORCED to fight, then fight with courage and win. Don\u2019t try to win . . . win! Love,\n\nDad\n\nBut there was more on his mind than his own mortality. He sometimes feared the worst for Zachary. In February 2012, Gordon Stewart received an unexpected, hysterical call from Ailes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting a target on my son\u2019s back!\u201d he screamed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be responsible if something happens!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nStewart, who had to hold the phone away from his ear, asked Ailes what on earth he was talking about.\n\nThat week, Philipstown.info published a brief item about recent hearings of the local planning board. The final paragraph reported that Ailes and his neighbor were seeking approval to adjust the line between their properties, which were owned by \u201cHudson Valley 2009, formed by Roger Ailes; Viewsave LLC; and Gerald Morris.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sue you!\u201d Ailes yelled into the phone.\n\nThe article, he said, put Zachary in danger because it disclosed the existence of a trust. He began fulminating about unrelated disputes, including the old charge that Stewart encouraged his employees to quit without giving notice. \u201cYou must know I did no such thing,\u201d Stewart said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d\n\n\u201cRoger, since you called and I said hello, you have insulted my integrity, called me a liar to my face, have threatened me with a lawsuit, accused me of potentially being an accomplice to the murder of your son,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cCan you explain to me how you can expect that approach will advance the purpose of your calling?\u201d\n\nAiles paused. \u201cYou need to get help!\u201d he blurted out and hung up.\n\nAn hour later, Ailes called back. This time, he calmly asked Stewart to take down the article from the website. Stewart told him he would get back to him. After discussing his concerns with his editor, Kevin Foley, and the reporter on the story, Stewart called Ailes and informed him that he would not be removing it.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how people are out to get me! I asked you for a favor and you\u2019re turning me down.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Stewart said, \u201cthere\u2019s no mention of your son. There\u2019s nothing in this article that would jeopardize you and your family. You\u2019re asking me to remove what happened at a public meeting, and I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nAiles repeated his claim that Stewart needed mental help. The conversation ended there. At home that night, Stewart\u2019s cell phone rang. It was Ailes calling for the third time that day. Stewart didn\u2019t pick up.\n\nLater that month, Ailes\u2019s old nemesis David Brock coauthored a new book, \"The Fox Effect: How Roger Ailes Turned a Network Into a Propaganda Machine,\" which synthesized the most damaging research that Media Matters had published over the past decade on its website. \u201cHe was obsessed with Brock\u2019s book,\u201d one Fox contributor recalled. In one meeting, Ailes said he couldn\u2019t \u201cdo anything\u201d until it was published. Highlighting leaked emails from Fox executives, which expressed overt right-wing bias, and detailing wild on-air claims about Obama\u2019s religion, background, and policies, the text provided Fox\u2019s detractors with rounds of ammunition to deploy in their battle to define Ailes as a master propagandist. In retaliation, Fox aired segments claiming Brock was mentally unstable.\n\nGoogle, Media Matters, and Philipstown.info were new media antagonists. Ailes\u2019s threats did not have the same effect on them that they did on legacy media outlets. This was especially the case with Gawker. On April 10, the gossip website introduced a new series. \u201cWhat follows is the inaugural column of a person we are calling The Fox Mole\u2014a long-standing, current employee of Fox News Channel who will be providing Gawker with regular dispatches from inside the organization,\u201d the editors wrote. The columns brought about a minor media convulsion, but the show had a short run. Within twenty-four hours, Fox executives successfully identified the Mole as Joe Muto, a thirty-year-old associate producer who\u2019d worked at the network for eight years, and fired him.\n\nWhen Muto quickly landed a low-six-figure book deal in early May to write about his exploits, Ailes decided to send a message. Jimmy Gildea, Ailes\u2019s security guard, told the boss he could press charges. \u201cIf this Gawker paid for stolen goods, it could be part of the crime, same as if somebody hires a hit man,\u201d the former cop said. Brian Lewis wanted Ailes to let it go, but was overruled. \u201cI told them,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cbut I was told that legal would be handling this from here forward. I\u2019m like, Okay.\u201d\n\nAt 6:30 in the morning on April 25, officers from the New York district attorney\u2019s office arrived at Muto\u2019s apartment with a warrant charging him with grand larceny and conspiracy, among other charges. They seized his iPhone, laptop, and old notebooks. A year later, a month before his book was published, Muto appeared in handcuffs at the Manhattan Criminal Court, where he pleaded guilty to a pair of misdemeanor charges: attempted unlawful duplication and criminal possession of computer-related material. The judge fined Muto $1,000, ordered him to forfeit a $5,000 fee he earned from Gawker for reporting on Fox, confiscated his Mac, and ordered him to do ten days of community service and two hundred hours of private service.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the 2012 presidential campaign, Ailes\u2019s worldview radiated from his daily editorial meetings onto the screen. \u201cHe likes to raise questions in chyrons,\u201d a senior producer said, referring to the graphics and the text that appear at the bottom of the screen. \u201cIs Obama a socialist? He tells producers that such an approach is better than simply saying Obama is a socialist.\u201d Ailes\u2019s anchors and pundits breathlessly inflated a panoply of administration blunders into full-blown conspiracies. While Fox reporters did some enterprising coverage of the deadly attack on the American consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, the journalism was undermined by one host claiming it was \u201cthe biggest news story since Watergate.\u201d A few days before the election, the mother of Sean Patrick Smith, a State Department employee killed in Benghazi, said that Fox\u2019s reports had caused her to believe that \u201cObama murdered my son.\u201d Fox hyped the influence of fringe groups like the New Black Panther Party and pushed fears of stolen elections. \u201cELECTION OFFICIALS IN BATTLEGROUND STATE OF OHIO FEAR WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD,\u201d one on-screen banner read.\n\nAiles\u2019s executives flattered him with suggestions that he go on camera and deliver the attack lines himself or even run for president. (Michael Clemente had \u201cAiles 2012\u201d bumper stickers printed and distributed around the second floor.) At some moments, Ailes demurred. \u201cThose days are gone,\u201d he told his team. At other moments, he indulged them. That summer, he told his inner circle at the afternoon strategy meeting that he wanted to host a talk show. His PR deputy, Irena Briganti, who was sitting in the room, advised him against it. \u201cThe media will go after you,\u201d she warned.\n\nSo when Ailes wanted to get his message out, he often turned to his lawyer, Peter Johnson Jr., who took to Fox & Friends to spread it. In private, Johnson spoke of Ailes like a father. Johnson told a Fox colleague Ailes thought of him as a son. Owing to his special status, Johnson was allowed to use the teleprompter to read from scripts, a perk that was normally reserved for Fox hosts. \u201cHe can load a script directly into the teleprompter. So it\u2019s not even Ailes unplugged. It\u2019s Ailes plugged in,\u201d one person familiar with the matter said. Johnson served up frightening scenarios filled with Muslim extremists and Occupy Wall Street anarchists and overreaching government bureaucrats, lacing his commentary with Nixonian bogeymen. On the day before Obama and Romney squared off in their final debate on foreign policy, Johnson discussed the situation in Benghazi. He speculated about whether Obama had known about the attack early enough to have ordered military action to save the Americans who were killed. \u201cIf he did nothing, then that is the shame of America,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI have no evidence for this,\u201d he mused, but \u201cwere these people expendable as part of a Mideast foreign policy?\u201d\n\nOn the afternoon of November 6\u2014Election Day\u2014Ailes had lunch with Karl Rove, who still believed in a Romney win. Few Fox pundits had stumped as hard as Rove had for the candidate. Rove\u2019s Super PAC, American Crossroads, and its affiliate, Crossroads GPS, had vowed to spend up to $300 million to back conservatives in the 2012 political campaigns. \u201cHell, maybe Karl\u2019s right,\u201d Ailes said later that day.\n\nAt 5:00 p.m., Ailes assembled his network\u2019s election team in the second-floor conference room to discuss the night\u2019s coverage. \u201cGuys,\u201d he told them, \u201cno matter how it goes, don\u2019t go out there looking like someone ran over your dog.\u201d But as Fox\u2019s exit poll team presented the numbers, Ailes came undone. \u201cThey weren\u2019t good for Romney,\u201d a person in the room said. \u201cRoger started arguing about how the sample skewed toward liberals.\u201d Ailes said, \u201cLiberals like to share their feelings, and conservatives work, so they don\u2019t vote until later.\u201d Arnon Mishkin, the head of Fox\u2019s decision desk team, told Ailes that the data accounted for a sample skew. It appeared that Romney was going to be trounced. Worse, so-called late deciders were breaking for Obama.\n\n\u201cThank you, Chris Christie,\u201d Ailes grumbled. He was still furious that Christie had given Obama a bipartisan photo op on the New Jersey coastline after Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\u201cActually, that\u2019s not true,\u201d Mishkin said. \u201cWe asked people that. There\u2019s no data in the polling to suggest that Sandy hurt Romney.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, hugging the guy couldn\u2019t help people feel good about Romney either,\u201d Ailes countered.\n\nData was no substitute for what his gut told him. \u201cEveryone left that room with the knowledge that Roger didn\u2019t believe the polls,\u201d a participant said. His opinion would be channeled on-air later that night, with embarrassing consequences.\n\nAbout an hour later, Ailes settled into a plush chair in the Fox Sports Suite. A couple hundred people, including Rupert Murdoch, mingled in the room snacking on sushi and lamb kabobs. One Fox executive recalled he made sure to avoid eating the raw fish in front of Ailes. \u201cSushi is liberal food,\u201d he explained. The election coverage played out on eight flat-screen televisions mounted on the wall. Around 8:00, Beth arrived. The PCN&R was going to press that night. She sat beside Ailes reviewing the week\u2019s edition on her iPad. Shortly before 11:00, with Romney\u2019s chances fading, Roger and Beth called it a night. \u201cI want to kiss Zac good night before he goes to sleep,\u201d Ailes told a journalist, trying to put the best spin on the outcome. \u201cIf Romney wins, it\u2019s good for the taxpayers. If Obama wins, it\u2019s great for our ratings.\u201d\n\nDownstairs, Arnon Mishkin and Fox\u2019s number crunchers were preparing to call Ohio for Obama. \u201cLet\u2019s remember this is Fox News calling Ohio. This will say something beyond Ohio going for Obama,\u201d Mishkin told Fox brass. Fox executives told Mishkin to get the numbers right and ignore the politics: \u201cIf we think Ohio has gone Obama, we call Ohio,\u201d said a Fox News executive.\n\nBret Baier announced the call on set. \u201cThat\u2019s the presidency, essentially,\u201d he said. Instantly, Fox phones lit up with angry phone calls and emails from the Romney campaign, who believed that the call was premature. After Baier\u2019s Ohio call, Rove took their complaints public, echoing Ailes\u2019s earlier comments, and conducting an on-air primer on Ohio\u2019s electoral math to dispute the outcome. With the network divided against itself, senior producers held a meeting to adjudicate. The decision desk stood their ground. They knew how momentous the call was. In the end, producers had to find a way to split the difference. Megyn Kelly walked through the newsroom to interview the decision desk. \u201cThis is Fox News,\u201d a person in the room said, \u201cso anytime there\u2019s a chance to show off Megyn Kelly\u2019s legs they\u2019ll go for it.\u201d\n\nBy midnight, Rove reluctantly seemed to concede. The moment became a symbol of the denialism that had taken hold on the right in the closing days of the election. On air, Dick Morris had predicted a Romney landslide, putting Romney\u2019s odds of winning at 90 percent. In private, some Fox staffers thought the network\u2019s boosterism had become a joke. At a rehearsal on the Saturday before the election, Megyn Kelly chuckled when she relayed to colleagues what someone had told her: \u201cI really like Dick Morris. He\u2019s always wrong, but he makes me feel good.\u201d\n\nOnly half of Roger Ailes\u2019s grand plan had come to pass. While Fox\u2019s ratings were still unchallenged, the channel had failed to elect the next president\u2014the circus on Fox had complicated the effort as well as assisted it. By giving airtime to the most outlandish voices on the right, Fox had helped distort the debate over the country\u2019s future, making it easier for voters to dismiss Republican arguments. Ailes\u2019s personal political impulses\u2014to enlist Chris Christie, or David Petraeus\u2014were at odds with the vivid political comedy Fox often programmed. It turned out that television and politics were different disciplines. In pursuit of ratings, Fox had sharpened national divisions\u2014and the division had favored the Democrats. Since the Nixon administration and TVN, the right had dreamed of a television channel that could make its case with the American public, to balance the debate. \u201cYou\u2019re a hero to our people,\u201d one prominent conservative told Ailes at a gala at the Kennedy Center. But in 2012, by this measure, Fox had been a failure.\n\nAfter Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 defeat, Mark Rozell, the acting dean of the George Mason University School of Public Policy, and Paul Goldman, a former chairman of Virginia\u2019s Democratic Party, wrote an essay noting the inverse relationship between the rise of conservative media and the Republican Party\u2019s ability to win national majorities. \u201cWhen the mainstream media reigned supreme, between 1952 and 1988, Republicans won seven out of the ten presidential elections,\u201d they reported. \u201cConservative talk show hosts and Fox News blame the \u2018lamestream\u2019 national media\u2019s \u2018liberal bias\u2019 for the GOP\u2019s poor showing since 1992. Yet the rise of the conservative-dominated media defines the era when the fortunes of GOP presidential hopefuls dropped to the worst levels since the party\u2019s founding in 1856.\u201d Perhaps the freak show had become too freakish.\n\nExcerpted from \"The Loudest Voice in the Room: How the Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News -- and Divided a Country,\" by Gabriel Sherman.
