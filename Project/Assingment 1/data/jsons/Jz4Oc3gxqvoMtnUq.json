    "content": "Generic drug prices have nearly quadrupled in the past five years \u2014 and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) has a plan to fix it .\nOn Monday , Sanders , who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination , rolled out a proposal that would place strict limits on how quickly pharmaceutical companies could hike generic drug prices . Specifically , drug manufacturers would have to pay a rebate back to Medicaid if their drug prices grew faster than inflation . Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D-MD ) is introducing the same bill in the House .\nGeneric drugs are cheaper versions of drugs that have lost their patent . But in recent years , the prices for generic drugs have been rising quickly and inexplicably . One report from pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran found that consumers paid , on average , $ 13.14 for each prescription of the 50 most popular generics in 2010 . By 2014 , they paid $ 62.10 \u2014 a 373 percent increase .\nSanders has previously cited federal records at hearings , showing that the prices of more than 1,200 generic medications rose an average of 448 percent between July 2013 and July 2014 .\nGeneric drugs are typically meant to make medicine cheaper , giving patients less-expensive access to the costly drug formulations that pharmaceutical companies develop . You can see this clearly in the over-the-counter market : you can get 100 generic ibuprofen pills for $ 7.49 \u2014 or pay $ 9.99 for the brand-name drug Advil .\nGeneric drugs now compose more than 80 percent of all prescriptions dispensed annually in the United States , and experts think that 's helped slow the growth of overall drug spending .\nIn recent years though , the market for generic prescription medications has become increasingly expensive , with drug manufacturers hiking up generic prices . This seems especially likely to happen when there is just one drug company making the generic , giving that manufacturer pretty complete control over the prices it wants to charge .\nConsider the case of albendazole , an antiparasite drug that helps kill an infection caused by worms . It 's not an especially common drug because it treats a relatively uncommon problem among lower-income populations , particularly refugees and immigrants .\nAlbendazole 's patents expired years ago but there 's still only one company that makes it , GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) .

Data published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the average cost Medicaid paid for an albendazole prescription has increased from $ 36.10 in 2008 to $ 241.30 in 2013 .\nThis is the exact same drug ; the only difference is that in the span of six years , its price tag rose six-fold .\nAnd albendazole is n't alone \u2014 there is a lot of data showing a steep increase in generic drug prices .
