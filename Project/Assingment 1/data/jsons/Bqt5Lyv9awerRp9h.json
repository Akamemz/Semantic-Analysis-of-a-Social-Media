Drought has marked six of the 15 years he \u2019 s lived in the state , he says , and it was uplifting to know that the recent rains had restored life to the parched lawns and dusty hillsides .\nBut Mr. Olson , a creative director at a Los Angeles advertising agency , has no illusions about the new situation . He plans to keep the habits he picked up during the drought , he says .\n\u201c It would be too bad if people took [ the governor \u2019 s announcement ] as permission to just run their faucets all day or wash their cars every day , \u201d Olson says . \u201c There \u2019 s no way of knowing that we \u2019 re not at the beginning of another six-year streak . \u201d\nHis concerns are well-founded : In 2015 , 39 percent of Californians named water as the state \u2019 s most important issue , according to the Public Policy Institute of California . The figure dropped to 8 percent in March , with interest shifting to flood management and infrastructure . The torrential rains that began the year appear to have washed away Californians \u2019 drought worries , says Mark Baldassare , the institute \u2019 s president and chief executive .\n\u201c A year ago , I was saying that the drought had gone on for so long by recent historical standards that it was going to have a lasting impact on the way people thought about water conservation , \u201d he says . \u201c But because we \u2019 ve had such a dramatic turn , it \u2019 s suddenly hard for people to hear policymakers and leaders say we have to be ready for the next drought . \u201d\nInterviews with residents up and down the state , however , add some nuance to the picture .\nDrought may no longer top Californians ' concerns , but many say they plan on saving water . Their stories suggest that consistent messaging coupled with firsthand experience can prompt people to see water conservation as a long-term practice , not just a crisis response .\n\u201c We lifted the toughest mandatory standards a year ago , and folks are still saving a lot , \u201d says Felicia Marcus , chair of the State Water Resources Control Board .\n\u201c We \u2019 re moving from an era in which we thought about water as a single-use product \u2013 something plentiful , something we can take for granted , particularly in an urban context , \u201d she adds . \u201c It \u2019 s really a shift to thinking about how we can be most reasonably efficient with how we use water . \u201d\nFor residents who have always been conscious of their ecological footprint , the drought affirmed the need for eco-friendly habits .\nMichael Skrzypek \u2013 who considers himself the hardcore environmentalist in his family \u2013 encouraged his wife and 7-year-old daughter to recycle graywater from their showers to use on their plants .
