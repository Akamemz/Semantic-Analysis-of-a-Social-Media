How 's Your State Doing ?\nTo safely phase out social distancing measures , the U.S. needs more diagnostic testing for the coronavirus , experts say . But how much more ?\nThe Trump administration said on April 27 that the U.S. will soon have enough capacity to conduct double the current amount of testing for active infections . The country has done nearly 248,000 tests daily on average in the past seven days , according to the nonprofit COVID Tracking Project . Doubling that would mean doing about 496,000 a day .\nWill that be enough ? What benchmark should states try to hit ?\nOne prominent research group , Harvard 's Global Health Institute , proposes that the U.S. should be doing more than 900,000 tests per day as a country . This projection , released Thursday , is a big jump from its earlier projection of testing need , which had been between 500,000 and 600,000 daily .\nHarvard 's testing estimate increased , says Ashish Jha , director of the Global Health Institute , because the latest modeling shows that the outbreak in the United States is worse than projected earlier .\n`` Just in the last few weeks , all of the models have converged on many more people getting infected and many more people [ dying ] , '' he says .\nBut each state 's specific need for testing varies depending on the size of its outbreak , explains Jha . The bigger the outbreak , the more testing is needed .\nOn Thursday , Jha 's group at Harvard published a simulation that estimates the amount of testing needed in each state by May 15 . In the graphic below , we compare these estimates with the average numbers of daily tests states are currently doing .\nTo make their state-by-state estimates , the Harvard Global Health Institute group started from a model of future case counts . It calculated how much testing would be needed for a state to test all infected people and any close contacts they may have exposed to the virus . ( The simulation estimates testing 10 contacts on average . )\n`` Testing is outbreak control 101 , because what testing lets you do is figure out who 's infected and who 's not , '' Jha says . `` And that lets you separate out the infected people from the noninfected people and bring the disease under control . ''\nThis approach is how communities can prevent outbreaks from flaring up . First , test all symptomatic people , then reach out to their close contacts and test them , and finally ask those who are infected or exposed to isolate themselves .\nOur chart also shows another testing benchmark for each state : the ratio of tests conducted that come back positive . Communities that see about 10 % or fewer positives among their test results are probably testing enough , the World Health Organization advises .
