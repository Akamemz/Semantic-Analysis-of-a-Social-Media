Pretending they are holds everyone back .\nSometimes I wish I could gather up all the women I \u2019 ve ever known , or encountered , and conduct this informal poll :\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve ever behaved badly and blamed it on your period .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve ever acted helpless in the face of an unpleasant-if-not-physically-demanding task like dealing with a wild animal that \u2019 s gotten inside the house .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve ever coerced a man into sex even though he didn \u2019 t seem to really want it .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve thought you were at liberty to do this coercing because men \u201c always want it \u201d and should feel lucky any time they get it .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve ever threatened to harm yourself if a man breaks up with you or doesn \u2019 t want to see you anymore .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve been physically abusive with a male partner , knowing you \u2019 d be unlikely to face any legal consequences .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve lied about being on birth control , or faked a pregnancy scare , to see how a man would respond .\nRaise your hand if you \u2019 ve ever manipulated a divorce or child custody dispute in your favor by falsely insinuating that a man has been abusive toward you or your child .\nIn this hypothetical gathering of every woman I \u2019 ve ever known or encountered ( I \u2019 m imagining a football stadium at decent capacity ) , I \u2019 m certain there is not a single one of these questions that , if answered honestly , wouldn \u2019 t send hands into the air . Including my own . I know I \u2019 m guilty on the pest control front . I don \u2019 t want to think too hard about some of the others .\nWe hear all too much about toxic masculinity , that amorphous term that refers to the way traits like aggression and emotional repression are baked into male social norms . It also frequently shows up in online feminism as lazy shorthand for registering disapproval of just about anything men do at all . But when are we going to grant equal rights to women and admit that toxic femininity also exists and can be just as poisonous ?\nThere are minor forms of feminine toxins , like blaming irrational temper tantrums on \u201c being hormonal \u201d or feigning helplessness in order to get what you want . And there are major toxins , many having to do with weaponizing your fragility so that those to whom you cause harm have a difficult time defending themselves , lest they look like the aggressors . Women , of course , can unleash these tactics on other women , be they romantic partners or not . But for the sake of this discussion , let \u2019 s say we are talking about women and men and sex . We \u2019 ve established that many men are socially conditioned to think that women owe them sex . But what about the women that assume that men should be grateful for any sex they get ?\nIn a free society , everyone , regardless of gender , is free to be a manipulative , narcissistic , emotionally destructive asshole .\nThroughout my life , I \u2019 ve heard countless men tell stories about going ahead with sex even though they didn \u2019 t really want to . Sometimes , it was because they didn \u2019 t want to hurt the woman \u2019 s feelings . Other times , it was because they feared being perceived as having a low sex drive .\nA remarkable number of men have told me about times when women approached them and , often wordlessly , initiated sexual encounters without the slightest provocation or questions asked . I \u2019 ve heard , more than once , about unsolicited hand jobs on school buses when they were boys . Also , more than once , men have told me about past grade school camping trips or overnight parties wherein girls they barely knew slipped into their sleeping bags or beds . In some cases , the men were happy to oblige the women \u2019 s desires . In other cases , though , they went through with the encounters because they didn \u2019 t want to make an awkward situation even more awkward .\nThese stories have been relayed to me in a tone I can only describe as bafflement . The men are not complaining , but nor are they boasting . If anything , they seem to be struggling to find the words to describe a not-entirely-welcome encounter that they felt they had no right to regard with anything other than gratitude . Needless to say , if you imagined any of these situations with the genders reversed , you \u2019 d have the potential for very different framing .\nI realize that the physical size difference between most women and most men means that the above comparison isn \u2019 t entirely fair ; a woman who \u2019 s sexually aggressive with a man is probably not putting him in insurmountable physical danger . And I \u2019 m cognizant of the fact that for every bad behavior I mentioned in my opening list of questions there is an equal , opposite , and potentially more physically threatening form of bad behavior that men can , and do , visit upon women with just as much frequency .\nBut that , right there , is precisely my point . In a free society , everyone , regardless of gender , or any other identification , is free to be a manipulative , narcissistic , emotionally destructive asshole . So I \u2019 m not sure why men have been getting all the credit lately .\nThe # BelieveWomen memes that have arisen in the wake of # MeToo in general , and the Brett Kavanaugh saga in particular , are coming from a place of empathy and good intentions . But they \u2019 re also stripping women of our complications and contradictions , and therefore our humanity .\nFor what it \u2019 s worth , I believed Christine Blasey Ford \u2019 s testimony about what happened between her and Kavanaugh when they were in high school . It is my personal belief , based on nothing more than gut feeling , that things transpired more or less as Ford described them and that Kavanaugh was too drunk at the time to remember . I believe that Kavanaugh effectively lied under oath about the extent of his drinking , and that this alone should have disqualified him from holding a seat on the Supreme Court .\nBut there is a difference between believing and knowing . Even if the judiciary committee had done the right thing and subpoenaed Mark Judge , who witnessed the encounter between Ford and Kavanaugh , and forced him to testify under oath , no one would ever have known definitively what happened that evening . All the truth digging in the world will not change the fact that all kinds of people misrepresent , misremember , misinterpret , and willfully or unwillfully make misleading statements for all kinds of reasons .\nAnd that is why # BelieveWomen , with its suggestion that women are some monolithic entity that is inherently more moral , innocent , or trustworthy than men , is not just reductive but insulting . Women are not simple , guileless creatures to whom only the most innocent motives should ever be ascribed . Both sexes contain multitudes . Or , as George Carlin put it , \u201c Men are from Earth , women are from Earth . Deal with it . \u201d\nMy opening list of \u201c raise your hand \u201d questions surely set some teeth on edge . It \u2019 s difficult to talk about things like women tricking men into getting them pregnant , not least of all because it makes you sound like a part of the men \u2019 s rights movement \u2014 a loosely knit and often self-defeating enterprise that overrides legitimate grievances about , say , the family court system , with ambient misogyny and conspiracy theories . When I was in my twenties , just hearing a phrase like \u201c tricking men \u201d would have made me assume it was coming from a woman-hating kook .\nBut the thing about growing older is that over the years , you run into more and more people and see all the different kinds of havoc they can wreak . I know men who , amid contentious divorce proceedings , have been accused , preposterously , of spousal and child abuse . I know women who are so skilled in the dark art of gaslighting that the targets of their mind games , be it boyfriends or BFFs , don \u2019 t stand a chance . Once , while working with high school students , I overheard some girls joking to one another about how they were going to go out that night and \u201c hit on older guys who don \u2019 t know we \u2019 re underage and later be like \u2018 Dude , you \u2019 re a pedophile . \u2019 \u201d\nI decided to give the girls the benefit of the doubt and assume they were just goofing around , condemning misogynist stereotypes about young women as jailbait by ironically reclaiming those stereotypes . Along the way , I tried to think like a good feminist and consider that patriarchal societies foster or even force this kind of manipulative female behavior because it \u2019 s often the only power available to women .\nBut that \u2019 s an excuse and a poor one .
