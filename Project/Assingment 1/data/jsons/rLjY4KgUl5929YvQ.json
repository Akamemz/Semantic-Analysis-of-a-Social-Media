That means that if the Iranians decided to race and produce enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon , it would take them a year , up from just a few weeks .\nTo accomplish that , the deal imposed limits on enriched uranium stockpiles and enrichment activities at Iran \u2019 s Fordow and Natanz sites .

Centrifuges are tall , thin metal tubes that spin at fantastic rates of speed , creating G-forces that separate isotopes of uranium gas and allow concentration of the U-235 isotope .\nUranium used in power plants is enriched to 5 % U-235 . Medical and research applications use 20 % enriched material . Nuclear weapons require 90 % enrichment .\nThe agreement also required Iran to render the core of its heavy water reactor at Arak inoperable .

He objected that it placed no curbs on Iran \u2019 s wider military activities , and that it was time-limited , as its major restrictions expired after 15 years . President Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the agreement in 2018 , and reimposed economic sanctions meant to isolate Iran from financial markets and end its oil exports .\nIran said the withdrawal amounted to the U.S. reneging on its agreements . Some countries continued to import Iranian oil under waivers granted by the Trump administration , but the U.S. ended the waiver program in 2019 . France , Germany , and the U.K. , eager to keep Iran in the nuclear deal , began a barter system to allow transactions with Iran outside the American banking system , but it dealt only with essentials such as food and medicine .\nUnder this pressure , Iran said it would no longer be bound by the JCPOA . In July 2019 , Iran exceeded limits set on its low-enriched uranium stocks . Since then , it has started to enrich some uranium to medical research levels and installed a small number of advanced centrifuge models , according to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .\nIn this context , Iran \u2019 s Jan. 5 announcement simply affirmed what was already clear . Iran said that , as far as it was concerned , it no longer faced any \u201c operational restrictions \u201d and that future actions would depend solely on Iran \u2019 s \u201c technical needs . \u201d\nIran has not yet completely withdrawn from the JCPOA . Notably , Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran would continue to cooperate with inspectors from the IAEA , the U.N. arm charged with on-site verification of the nuclear deal .\nThat means the world will continue to periodically receive IAEA reports of Iran \u2019 s overt nuclear enrichment activities , including measures of enrichment levels and stockpile growth .\nWhether the U.S. , Iran , and other partners will resume nuclear negotiations , aiming for a broader deal that settles the Trump administration \u2019 s stated concerns about missile development and regional meddling , is much less certain . To this point , the U.S. policy of so-called maximum pressure has not brought Tehran back to the table , even though Iran \u2019 s economy contracted by 9.5 % in 2019 , unemployment has spiked , and protests have roiled Iranian cities .\nMeanwhile , uncertainty as to Iran \u2019 s nuclear intentions will grow . In November , the IAEA reported that Iran now has 372 kilograms of uranium enriched to 5 % U-235 . If the country begins to produce five kilograms of such material each day \u2013 a production level Iranian nuclear officials say is possible \u2013 it could reach 1,050 kilograms in about four months .
