    "content": "Julian Assange insists , against all evidence , that the hacked Democratic emails WikiLeaks published did n't come from Russian intelligence services . \u201c Our source is not the Russian government , \u201d he said in a Tuesday interview with Fox News \u2019 s Sean Hannity .\nThis is a touch hard to believe . Publicly available evidence , including unique code and Russian writing in the hacked documents themselves , links the document theft to Russian state-sponsored hacks . Every US intelligence agency that has investigated the issue has concluded Russia is , in fact , responsible . Leaks from their analyses , reported by CNN and the Washington Post , indicate that the US has identified the go-betweens used by Russia to hand documents to WikiLeaks . Assange is either lying or willfully blind to the facts .\nIndeed , when it comes to Russia , Assange doesn \u2019 t have a ton of credibility .\nThroughout WikiLeaks \u2019 existence , the allegedly pro-transparency group has had strange , shadowy , but very well-documented connections to the Russian state . The connections range from sharing purloined documents with a pro-Russian dictator to Assange receiving money for appearing on Russian state TV to WikiLeaks \u2019 key involvement in NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden ending up in Russia .\nThese incidents don \u2019 t prove , as some have alleged , that Assange is some kind of paid Russian agent , or that WikiLeaks is a Russian front organization . But they do show that WikiLeaks , an organization purportedly devoted to transparency , is at a minimum okay with helping out the world \u2019 s most aggressively authoritarian leader .\nThe Kremlin is just as friendly . Russian officials , up to and including Putin himself , have defended Assange and WikiLeaks \u2014 with one Russian official even suggesting Assange deserves a Nobel Peace Prize . It \u2019 s a strange relationship : a secretive quasi-dictator lining up alongside a group that says it 's dedicated to revealing state secrets . But it 's the relationship Putin appears to have turned to when he was looking for a trusted ally to leak the emails hacked from Clinton \u2019 s circle .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t necessarily think he \u2019 s some sort of paid agent for the Russians , \u201d says Chris Zappone , an editor at the Age newspaper in Assange \u2019 s native Australia who has covered Assange \u2019 s Russian ties extensively . \u201c But I do think he \u2019 s being manipulated by the Russians . \u201d\nWikiLeaks first came to international attention in 2010 , when it published secret US government footage showing American helicopters in Iraq firing at journalists . By the end of the year , it had also published tranches of US military documents on the Afghan War as well as State Department diplomatic cables .\nThese disclosures established what would become a clear pattern : WikiLeaks disclosures would , disproportionately , reveal secrets about the United States and its allies . They also established the group as a major player on the international stage , bringing it in for a level of scrutiny it had never received before .\nOne of the things reporters uncovered was the strange past of one WikiLeaks employee : a professional anti-Semite named Israel Shamir .\nShamir , who has gone by six names over the course of his life , was born Izrail Schmerler , in Russia . He converted from Judaism to the Greek Orthodox Church later in life , and turned viciously on his former co-religionists . He has denied the Holocaust , called Jews \u201c a virus in human form , \u201d and , in 2010 , published a book titled Breaking the Conspiracy of the Elders of Zion .\nShamir was also a longtime friend of Julian Assange , who tasked him with helping to disseminate WikiLeaks documents in his native Russia in early 2010 .\n\u201c Shamir has a years-long friendship with Assange , and was privy to the contents of tens of thousands of US diplomatic cables months before WikiLeaks made public the full cache , \u201d James Ball , a former WikiLeaks staffer , wrote at the Guardian the next year . \u201c Shamir aroused the suspicion of several WikiLeaks staffers \u2014 myself included \u2014 when he asked for access to all cable material concerning \u2018 the Jews , \u2019 a request which was refused . \u201d\nThe first thing Shamir did with the documents was hand some off to Russian Reporter magazine , a Kremlin-friendly newsweekly . He then offered to sell access to them to the highest bidder , David Leigh and Luke Harding write in the book Wikileaks : Inside Julian Assange \u2019 s War on Secrecy .\nBut what he did next was exceptionally curious . Shamir traveled to Belarus , a country ruled by dictator Alexander Lukashenko and perhaps Putin \u2019 s staunchest ally in Europe . Shamir was a fan of Lukashenko ; in a 2010 piece , he called Belarus \u201c the Shangri-la of the post-Soviet development . \u201d\nIn Belarus , Shamir shared State Department cables pertaining to the country with government officials \u2014 in unredacted , unedited form .\nIn January 2011 , Belarusian state-run media began publishing what it said were US diplomatic cables from Shamir \u2019 s cache , alleging that Lukashenko \u2019 s opponents were funded abroad . According to several Belarusian dissidents who spoke to Tablet , the names in the cables were also used to identify lower-level dissidents .\n\u201c The extent to which WikiLeaks and Israel Shamir have endangered the lives of pro-democracy activists in Belarus will become chillingly clear as innocent men and women continue to disappear , \u201d Kapil Komireddi , author of the Tablet piece , writes .\nWikiLeaks issued a weak public disavowal of Shamir \u2019 s Belarusian caper in February 2011 , saying \u201c obviously it is not approved. \u201d But according to Ball , the internal discourse on Shamir was somewhat different .\n\u201c Assange shamefully refused to investigate [ the Belarus incident ] , \u201d Ball recalled in his Guardian piece . \u201c The two [ Shamir and Assange ] remain close . \u201d\nThis isn \u2019 t a direct link between Assange and the Kremlin , per se . But it established what would soon become a clear pattern : Assange and WikiLeaks providing cover to authoritarians , especially those allied with Putin .\nAssange claims to be a radical opponent of authoritarianism and state oppression . But he allowed Shamir to hand off documents to a pro-Kremlin publication , exclusively , and then use his documents to aid a state-sponsored crackdown on dissidents . Assange showed no meaningful remorse afterward .\nAs all this was going on , Russian officials began praising Assange and WikiLeaks at an increasingly loud volume . It was becoming clear that Assange \u2019 s disclosures targeted and embarrassed the United States far more than any other power \u2014 music to the Kremlin \u2019 s ears .\nIn December 2010 , shortly after Shamir handed off cables to Belarus , an anonymous Kremlin official suggested that Assange should be given the Nobel Peace Prize . The next day , Vladimir Putin personally defended Assange against charges , filed in Sweden , that he had raped two women . According to Putin , the allegations were politically motivated and not credible . ( Swedish courts disagree . )\n`` If it is full democracy , then why have they hidden Mr. Assange in prison ? That 's what , democracy ? '' the Russian leader said at a press conference . The next month , the Russian government offered Assange a visa \u2014 an opportunity to live in a country that would not likely extradite him to Sweden .\nIn April 2012 , the relationship between Assange and Russia became direct for the first time . Specifically , Assange became a star on Russia Today ( RT ) , Russia \u2019 s state-funded English-language propaganda outlet .\n\u201c With WikiLeaks \u2019 funding drying up \u2014 under American pressure , Visa and MasterCard had stopped accepting donations \u2014 Russia Today began broadcasting a show called \u2018 The World Tomorrow \u2019 with Mr. Assange as the host , \u201d the New York Times reported in a 2016 piece on Assange \u2019 s Russian ties .\nThe exact nature of the arrangement between RT and Assange has never been very clear . Assange and WikiLeaks insist that Assange was never employed by RT , and that RT was only one of many broadcasters that bought rights to air Assange \u2019 s show . Either way , though , Assange was paid by the Kremlin . According to the Times , the amount of money he received has never been disclosed .\nThe World Tomorrow had a decidedly anti-American bent , in keeping with much of RT \u2019 s programming and Assange \u2019 s own writing . Its first episode was a polite interview with Hassan Nasrallah , the head of the Iranian-backed Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah . In the interview , Assange refers to Nasrallah as a \u201c freedom fighter , \u201d telling him \u201c you have fought against a hegemony of the United States . \u201d\nThat this was serving an ideological purpose could have been lost on Assange . RT is designed to be the voice of the Russian state in the English-speaking world , particularly America . It \u2019 s part of a broad-based Russian propaganda effort aimed at whitewashing Putin \u2019 s government , using attacks on alleged US misdeeds as a key strategy .\nIt \u2019 s an old tactic used by Soviet apologists , called \u201c whataboutism. \u201d Whenever an American criticized the Soviet Union , the Soviet apologist would say , \u201c What about the bad things America does ? \u201d This wasn \u2019 t a genuine moral criticism of the United States , which was often quite deserved , so much as a debating tactic aimed at deflecting a moral critique of Soviet policy .\nAssange eagerly participated in an extended campaign of whataboutism . Not just that , in fact : He was paid by an authoritarian government , one that kills and arrests dissenters , for doing so . His principles as a transparency activist seem not to have gotten in the way .\nAfter Assange \u2019 s brief stint on RT \u2014 The World Tomorrow only lasted 12 episodes \u2014 links between Assange and Russia kept cropping up . A few notable examples :\nAssange claims to have inspired Snowden to flee to Russia : \u201c I thought , and in fact advised Edward Snowden , that he would be safest in Moscow , \u201d he told Democracy Now . A WikiLeaks employee , Sarah Harrison , literally flew with Snowden from Hong Kong ( where he had been living ) to Moscow .\nIn order to avoid extradition to Sweden , Assange holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London . According to the Ecuadorian publication Focus Ecuador , Assange asked for control over the selection of his bodyguards , and insisted that they be Russian .\nAssange used the WikiLeaks Twitter account to attack the 2016 Panama Papers leaks , which disclosed a $ 2 billion overseas account of Vladimir Putin \u2019 s . Assange labeled the leak a US-sponsored plot to undermine Putin and Russia .\nAgain , none of these even hint that Assange is a Russian agent . What they do show , when put together , is that Assange doesn \u2019 t see Russia as an enemy or a target . He instead seems to see them as something akin to \u201c the enemy of my enemy \u201d \u2014 the \u201c enemy , \u201d in this case , being the US and its allies . As a result , he is more than happy to work with them in situations where their interests align .\nWhich brings us to the 2016 election hack and Assange \u2019 s denial of Russian involvement .\nAssange \u2019 s history shows that he is not an impartial arbiter when it comes to Russia and the United States . He is more than willing to carry water for the Russian state , as evidenced by his stint on RT . In the absence of public evidence supporting them , his denials should be given very little weight \u2014 he is merely repeating the line set out by his friends in the Kremlin .\nNow , this could be because Assange is actively lying . My own suspicion is a little different : that he \u2019 s in something more like willful denial . The Russian go-between that handed him the documents likely posed as anonymous , and Assange probably didn \u2019 t ask too many questions ( as is standard practice at WikiLeaks ) .\nIt would be inconvenient for him to admit that the evidence shows Russia gave him the documents . He \u2019 d be conceding far more brazen collaboration between WikiLeaks and an authoritarian power than we \u2019 ve seen in the past , which would further damage the group \u2019 s already fraying credibility . It also would embarrass said authoritarian state , perhaps WikiLeaks \u2019 most reliable partner on the world stage , for Assange to contradict its public line .\nBut I can \u2019 t prove it either \u2014 Assange didn \u2019 t respond to an interview request for this piece . The thing I am quite sure of , however , is that Julian Assange has proven , beyond a reasonable doubt , to be very much less than clear-eyed when Russia is involved .\nCorrection : An earlier version of this piece referred to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as Alexander Poroshenko . We regret the error .",
