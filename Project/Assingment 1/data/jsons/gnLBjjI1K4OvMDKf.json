    "content": "The Democratic campaign to relax national , state and local deportation policies is fueling outrage ignited by the shocking slaying of a woman in San Francisco by an oft-deported illegal immigrant with seven felony convictions .\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte slammed the Obama administration for turning federal requests to detain illegal immigrants into \u201c something voluntary \u201d and \u201c releasing criminals back onto the streets . \u201d\n\u201c This administration is not enforcing our immigration laws , \u201d the Virginia Republican said . \u201c And , quite frankly , I don \u2019 t think they care . \u201d\nHe cited last week \u2019 s arrest of Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez , 45 , who has confessed to shooting and killing Kathryn Steinle , 32 , as she walked with her father along Pier 14 . Lopez-Sanchez , who told KGO-TV that the shooting was an accident , has seven prior felony convictions and has been deported five times .\n\u201c This tragedy in San Francisco \u2014 which is repeated every day around the country but doesn \u2019 t get this kind of notoriety \u2014 is a product of that lack of caring about the rule of law , \u201d Mr. Goodlatte said .\nSEE ALSO : California Congressional Dems had urged Jerry Brown to sign 2013 anti-deportation bill\nMeanwhile , the White House moved to shift the blame to Republicans by faulting them for opposing Democrat-sponsored comprehensive immigration reform legislation , which GOP lawmakers have dismissed as an amnesty program .\n\u201c The president has done everything within his power to make sure that we \u2019 re focusing our law enforcement resources on criminals and those who pose a threat to public safety , \u201d Mr . Earnest said . \u201c It \u2019 s because of the political efforts of Republicans that we have not been able to make the kind of investment that we would like to make in securing our border and keeping our communities safe . \u201d\nThat statement drew hoots from critics who pointed to the Obama administration \u2019 s decision in November to drop the 2008 Secure Communities program , installed by the Bush administration to enhance cooperation with state and local law enforcement on removing illegal aliens .\n\u201c What you see right now is a Department of Homeland Security that \u2019 s been intentionally isolated , not just from state and local agencies , but also from other federal agencies in what is an overt and malicious effort to jeopardize public safety and security in a quest to try to lock up the Latino vote for the next 50 years , \u201d said Dan Stein , president of the anti-amnesty Federation for American Immigration Reform .\nSocial media was abuzz with criticism over the shooting . Said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , on Twitter : \u201c Another American killed by sanctuary city policies shielding illegal aliens from deportation . \u201d\nDemocrats and pro-immigrant groups have emphasized in recent years deportation policies focused on illegal aliens with criminal records , arguing that resources are better spent on violent offenders than those with no prior arrests or convictions on minor offenses .\nBut a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions , Alabama Republican , said the removal of convicted criminal illegal aliens has been cut in half since 2011 , thanks to a lengthy series of moves to weaken immigration enforcement .\n\u201c The administration \u2019 s relentless determination to strip away America \u2019 s immigration laws [ has ] resulted in thousands of preventable crimes , \u201d spokesman Stephen Miller said .\n\u201c You couldn \u2019 t name a single thing this administration has done to try to increase immigration law enforcement , \u201d he said . \u201c The whole administrative amnesty is built on the charade that resource reasons require that they focus solely on criminal aliens . \u201d\nNowhere has that policy been more evident than in California . In October 2013 California Gov . Jerry Brown signed a bill requiring law enforcement to turn away detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement involving nonfelons .\nThe bill was signed by Mr. Brown after a previous veto and repeated pressure from California \u2019 s Democratic lawmakers in Washington , led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi .\nMr. Brown signed Assembly Bill 4 , known as the TRUST Act , following an August letter from Mrs. Pelosi and 27 other House Democrats from California urging him to \u201c limit burdensome detentions of aspiring citizens by local law enforcement . \u201d\nThe law , which went into effect Jan. 1 , 2014 , allows California to avoid turning over illegal immigrants under the federal Secure Communities program unless they have committed serious crimes . In November the Obama administration discontinued the program , launched by President George W. Bush in 2008 .\nMr. Brown vetoed a similar bill in 2012 , but signed A.B . 4 after it was expanded to allow local law enforcement to honor detainer holds for those charged with felonies , not just those convicted . Mrs. Pelosi and more than 20 other U.S. House Democrats from California had also urged him in another letter to sign the 2012 bill .\nSeparately , the San Francisco board of supervisors approved an ordinance in Sept. 2013 stopping law enforcement from complying with ICE detainers unless the person in custody has a conviction for a violent crime such as murder , sexual assault , trafficking or assault with a deadly weapon .\nThe result is that 10,156 federal detention requests were declined in California alone from Jan. 10 , 2014 , to June 19 , 2015 , or about 59 percent of declined detainers nationally , said Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez .\nSupporters of the \u201c no-hold \u201d policy say it encourages illegal aliens to interact with police , but even the ACLU of Northern California was puzzled by the San Francisco Sheriff \u2019 s Department decision to release Lopez-Sanchez , calling the move a \u201c tragic anomaly . \u201d\n\u201c It is still unclear why the federal government turned over someone who is known to be deportable to the city of San Francisco , knowing that San Francisco is one of the oldest sanctuary cities in the country , \u201d said the ACLU-NC statement .\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office said prosecutors had declined to press charges against Lopez-Sanchez on a drug-related offense . Officials with ICE had requested a detainer , but they had not followed up with a warrant or judicial order .\nSan Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee said Monday he was \u201c concerned \u201d about events leading up to the felon \u2019 s release .\nBut the mayor defended the sanctuary city policy , saying it helped immigrants gain access to social services without \u201c fear of their city government reporting them to federal authorities . \u201d\nSan Francisco City and County Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said Monday in an interview on CNN that the sanctuary city policy \u201c makes us safer \u201d by encouraging witnesses and crime victims in the country illegally to contact police .\n\u201c I firmly believe it makes it safer . We \u2019 re a world-renowned city with a large immigrant population . And of that population is a population that is also here undocumented , \u201d he said . \u201c From a law enforcement perspective , we want to build trust with that population . And our sanctuary city and other attendant laws have allowed us to do that . \u201d\nBillionaire Donald Trump , who came under fire last month for saying that some illegal immigrants are \u201c rapists , \u201d said Monday that Mexico shares in the blame for sending criminals over the border .\n\u201c The government of Mexico \u2014 look , this other guy that killed the young woman in San Francisco , they threw him out . They \u2019 re pushing the bad ones in here , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nMr. Trump is so far the only Republican presidential candidate to comment publicly on the San Francisco slaying .\n\u201c It \u2019 s such a sad thing , and this is a guy that should have stayed in Mexico . He should not have been allowed in our country and , because of the weak borders , we have him here , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c There \u2019 s an example of how disgraceful it is .
