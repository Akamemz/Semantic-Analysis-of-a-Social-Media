    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) - With three days to go until the start of the Republican convention , President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney remain deadlocked in the race for the White House , according to a new national survey .\nA CNN/ORC International poll released Friday also indicates Romney 's favorable rating among those likely to vote in the presidential election is in the same ballpark as the president 's , and the survey also points to a slightly higher level of enthusiasm for Republicans than Democrats .\nAccording to the poll , 49 % of likely voters say they 're backing Obama , with 47 % supporting Romney . The two point margin is within the survey 's sampling error , meaning the race is a statistical tie .\nAmong the larger pool of registered voters , some of whom will stay at home on Election Day , the survey indicates the president holds a 52 % -43 % lead . That number is little changed from CNN 's previous poll , conducted in early August , before Romney named House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan as his running mate .\n`` Likely voters have traditionally been a more Republican group in past elections because they tend to turn out in higher numbers than Democrats , and 2012 looks like it is no exception . This explains why the margin between President Obama and Mitt Romney is smaller among likely voters , '' says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` But it is a mistake to say that the race has tightened in the past few weeks , given the lack of movement in the results for registered voters . ''\nIn an election , it all comes down to turnout , and that 's what a likely voter model is all about . The more enthusiastic you are about voting , the likelier you are to actually vote in November . According to the poll , 35 % of registered Republicans questioned say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting , six points higher than the 29 % of Democrats who feel the same way .\nFour years ago , two-thirds of Democrats said they were extremely or very enthusiastic about voting , giving them an 18-point lead over Republicans that helped Obama overcome the fact that turnout has historically been higher among Republicans . Now the two parties are evenly divided .\n`` Enthusiasm is down among key elements of the Obama coalition from the last presidential election , indicating that some of his supporters are not likely to vote unless something changes . The challenge for the president in his convention is to fire up his base and to turn those potential stay-at-homes into likely voters . If he can do so , the likely voter model may not work as much in Romney 's favor in September as it does in August , '' adds Holland .\nIn the horserace , 48 % of likely voters who are independents say they support Romney , with 45 % backing Obama . The gender gap and generational divides seen in polling so far this cycle continue , with the president holding a 54 % -42 % lead among female likely votes and Romney holding a 53 % -43 % lead among male likely voters . Obama has a 55 % -43 % advantage among those under 50 , with Romney holding a 50 % -45 % margin among likely voters 50 and older .\n`` The two candidates are in a dead heat in the national horserace , tied among likely voters who call themselves independents and tied in the suburbs , '' says Chief National Correspondent John King .\n`` Which means the conventions are their best chance to nudge the numbers a bit before we get to what is likely to be a decisive series of debates . The race could break near the end , but heading into the conventions it is as close as can be .
