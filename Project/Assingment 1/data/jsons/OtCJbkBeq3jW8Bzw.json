And with those two words , Judge Gorsuch appeared to be distancing himself from President Trump , carefully asserting his own independence and demonstrating a willingness to stand up to the man who nominated him .\nYet even before the saga over the meaning and original intent of the nominee \u2019 s words began to unfold on Thursday \u2013 with President Trump arguing that the media was misinterpreting his words \u2013 many liberals were already making this case for the deeply conservative jurist , calling Mr. Trump \u2019 s nominee one of the most independent-minded judges in the country .\nIt is a difficult pivot for many Democrats to make . Republican senators \u2019 refusal even to schedule a hearing for President Obama \u2019 s nominee , Judge Merrick Garland , last year still rankles .
