That applies to a drug sniffing dog 's alert , as it would to any other basis for probable cause .\n`` The question -- similar to every inquiry into probable cause -- is whether all the facts surrounding a dog 's alert , viewed through the lens of common sense , would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime , '' she wrote . `` A sniff is up to snuff when it meets that test .
