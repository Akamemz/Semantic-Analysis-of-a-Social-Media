''\n`` It is our duty to respond appropriately , '' Pompeo said , adding that the US had provided `` ample time '' for Russia to return to compliance .\nThe long-expected suspension , which has raised concerns about a renewed arms race with Moscow and put European allies on edge , goes into effect on Saturday .

''\nLater , at the White House , the President hinted to reporters that he 'd be open to negotiations on a new treaty but did not mention Russia by name -- the only other signatory to the pact .\n`` I hope that you 're able to get everybody in a big and beautiful room and do a new treaty that would be much better , but certainly I would like to see that , '' Trump said , according to pool reports . `` But you have to have everybody adhere to it and you have a certain side that almost pretends it does n't exist .
