    "content": "Since President Trump was elected , the stock market has been doing well . Many attribute the performance to optimism about fundamental tax reform , in particular , the destructive corporate income tax system .\nThere are good reasons to be optimistic . You 'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks the corporate income tax system does n't need fundamental changes . Until recently there was a widespread and bipartisan consensus about the need to address the problem .\nAt 35 percent , the U.S. has the highest corporate rate of all wealthy nations . Unlike most of our competitors , we also have a worldwide tax system . This means Uncle Sam taxes income earned by companies overseas , income already subject to tax if they bring it back to the United States . This has created a highly uncompetitive environment for U.S. companies doing business at home and abroad .\nIn the wake of the election , Republicans had a golden opportunity to enact long-cherished reforms . This optimism overlooked the Republicans ' incredible tendency to make self-defeating decisions .\nRather than being well on their way to passing a tax reform plan that would grow the economy and simplify the tax code , momentum has been dissipated in a counterproductive fight over a `` border-adjustable '' provision being pushed by House Republicans as part of a new 20 percent tax on businesses .\nThis provision of the Better Way Plan , which otherwise promotes growth and reduces penalties against work , savings and investment , disallows any deductions for imports ( which is the same as levying a tax ) and eliminates all taxes on revenue generated by exports .\nIt feels like export mercantilism because it is another attempt to hammer imports while promoting exports . Its proponents have admitted they hoped it would dissuade the president to impose more punishing tariffs . The immediate result is the dividing of the business community , which surely would be unified in support of a GOP plan absent the border adjustable tax .\nThe usual beneficiaries of other pro-export corporate welfare policies , like Boeing and GE , are , not surprisingly , cheering the measure . American retailers who rely heavily on imports are lined up against it . A company the size of Walmart might stomach the extra cost but small businesses with razor-sharp profit margins may not survive the change .\nThere is also the risk of increasing consumer prices to offset the impact of the import tax , although proponents claim the value of the dollar will automatically rise in value and neutralize the impact on trade .\nWays and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady ( R-TX ) recently told Politico Pro , `` I 'm confident that the currency does adjust very efficiently and quickly , which avoids consumer price impacts . Indeed , friction-free economic textbook models predict the dollar will adjust perfectly and immediately to offset the pain of the new tax .
