Nothing better protects consumers and workers than free choice in a competitive marketplace .\nRomney also made it clear that he does n't want to reduce government revenues . He insisted that his 20 percent cut in tax rates would be revenue neutral .\n`` In order for us not to lose revenue \u2014 have the government run out of money \u2014 I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth .
