Is the White House still pushing to have that passed ? Do you assume that it 's now not going to happen ?\nBiden : I am still pushing that it pass . We are still pushing that it pass . The same thing was told to me when the first assault weapons ban in 1994 was attached to the Biden Crime bill ; that it could n't possibly pass . It was declared dead several times . I believe that the vast majority of the American people agree with us . The vast majority of gun owners agree with us . That military-style assault weapons are \u2013 these are weapons of war .
