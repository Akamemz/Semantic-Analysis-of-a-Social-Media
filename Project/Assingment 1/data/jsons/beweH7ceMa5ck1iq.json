However , Obama suggested Friday that those upset about the verdict would be unwise to expect a federal prosecution .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s important for people to have some clear expectations here , \u201d Obama said . \u201c And law enforcement is traditionally done at the state and local levels , not at the federal levels . \u201d\nRomero , who provided Murphy \u2019 s letter to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , said Thursday there was no intent to change or depart from the double jeopardy policy .\n\u201c I think there are real serious concerns about going back on the double jeopardy policy . It is a slippery slope that if you allow the government to prosecute individuals for one crime and then fail and try again , it creates the wrong incentives for the criminal justice system , \u201d Romero said in an interview on the outskirts of the Aspen Security Forum .\nRomero acknowledged that cases like that of Trayvon Martin sometimes prompt disagreements within the organization , and often put the group at odds with other civil rights groups .\n\u201c Good civil libertarians will differ on this issue , like a lot of our issues that divide the membership or the leadership whether it \u2019 s campaign finance or whether it \u2019 s civil rights prosecutions after a failed trial , \u201d he said . \u201c The unique part of the ACLU is that we have to balance some of the concerns that we have that are long-standing , deep-seated values like racial justice against broader concerns about the administration of justice . \u201d\nRomero \u2019 s critics see the statement as part of a pattern of incidents in which the ACLU has departed from or muddied its long-standing civil liberties positions , often in an effort to accommodate liberal interest groups like abortion rights and gay rights advocates .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just astonishing to me that a statement like that could go out without any understanding that they were violating their own policy , \u201d said Ira Glasser , who served as executive director of the ACLU from 1978 to 2001 .
