If the justices so decide , they could avoid putting a thumb on the scale favoring the president or Congress .\n`` It 's an uncomfortable position for the court , '' says Peter Shane , who teaches constitutional law at Ohio State University Moritz College of Law . `` There \u2019 s nothing in it for the court to antagonize one of them if they don \u2019 t have to . ''\nAmong the justices who might find that attractive are Chief Justice John Roberts , who seeks to keep the court out of politics when possible , and Trump 's two high court nominees , Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh , who otherwise face the choice of protecting or opposing the president who nominated them .\nRoberts wrote the court 's 5-4 decision last summer that said disputes over partisan gerrymandering by state legislatures were `` political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts . ''\n`` In a novel political fight like this , the court might well look for ways both to extricate itself and to keep future fights like this out of the court system , '' says Lawrence Joseph , an attorney who suggested that approach to the court on behalf of the conservative Eagle Forum Education & Legal Defense Fund .\nBut both sides in the current dispute urged the justices Friday to weigh in on the merits rather than invoke the `` political question '' doctrine .\n`` Judicial abstention here would not fence off the court from ' a political tug-of-war , ' '' Trump 's lawyer William Consovoy wrote . `` It would be writing every congressional committee a blank check to subpoena any personal records it wants from any president any time it wishes simply by seeking those records from a custodian with no incentive to draw the ire of Congress . That is constitutionally intolerable . ''\n`` It is in the committees \u2019 interest for this court to reach the merits now , rather than to let doubts as to the subpoenas \u2019 validity linger , '' House general counsel Douglas Letter agreed . `` It is also in the interest of the executive branch for this court to reach the merits here . The courts should be available to provide the executive branch safeguards , should it ever need them . ''\nIt 's not clear whether punting the battle with Congress back to the executive and legislative branches would help or hurt Trump in the end . House Democrats are seeking banking and accounting records held by Mazars USA , Deutsche Bank and Capital One . In a stalemate between the White House and Congress , they could refuse to release them or hand them over .\nThe legal battles pit Trump against three House committees , controlled by Democrats , that have issued subpoenas for eight years of financial documents . A separate fight involves Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance 's subpoena for similar documents as well as the tax returns that Trump , unlike recent predecessors , has not released voluntarily .\nLawmakers claim the records will help determine the need for future legislation in areas such as campaign finance law , bank loan practices , and efforts to prevent foreign influence in elections . Trump 's lawyers say it 's a fishing expedition to see if the president is guilty of tax fraud or money laundering .\n\u2022 The political earthquake that some justices may be seeking to sidestep would be most acutely felt if the president loses and the documents are made public during his reelection campaign . For nearly five years since declaring his candidacy in 2015 , Trump has managed to keep his tax returns and much of his financial data from prying eyes .\n`` Publicly releasing information about individuals is a form of punishment , '' Trump 's lawyers argue in court papers . `` Yet that has been the goal here from the start . ''\n\u2022 Congress has much at stake as well . Its oversight authority could be constrained by a ruling in Trump 's favor , setting a precedent for future investigations \u2013 particularly those viewed as partisan .\n`` In more than 20 cases concerning the scope of Congress \u2019 s power to investigate , this court has only once held that a congressional inquiry exceeded its constitutional limits , '' House lawyers contend in defending the subpoenas .\n\u2022 There also are high stakes facing the high court . If it sides with Trump along ideological lines \u2013 with five justices named by Republican presidents in the majority and four named by Democrats in dissent \u2013 it could emerge as damaged goods in the eyes of the public .\n`` If the president wins and it \u2019 s 5-4 \u2026 there will be people claiming that the president 's appointees have come to his defense , '' says Saikrishna Prakash , a University of Virginia law professor whose recent book , The Living Presidency , warns of its ever-expanding powers .\nThe congressional subpoenas emanate from three House committees , rather than one or both houses of Congress \u2013 a potential shortcoming Trump 's lawyers have sought to impress upon the Supreme Court .\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform issued a subpoena to Mazars USA , Trump 's accounting firm , more than a year ago seeking financial records from the president , his family business , a trust and the company that runs Trump International Hotel in Washington , D.C .
