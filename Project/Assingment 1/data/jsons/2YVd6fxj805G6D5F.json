    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Donald Trump 's behavior is n't doing much to bolster White House assurances that he 's got nothing to worry about from Robert Mueller 's probe , after a series of potentially ominous turns in the Russia investigation .\nThe President 's recent barrage of tweets and comments and testimony from sources close to him -- coinciding with thickening intrigue around the special counsel -- hint instead at deep concern on Trump 's part .\n`` While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way , at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief . This is our Joseph McCarthy Era ! '' Trump tweeted Wednesday , a day after blasting the special counsel as a `` conflicted prosecutor gone rogue . ''\nDespite this outburst of fury , White House press secretary Sarah Sanders painted a portrait of a President who was serenely awaiting Mueller 's findings .\n`` I do n't think the President has any concerns about the report because he knows that there was no wrongdoing by him and that there was no collusion , '' Sanders told reporters at her first daily briefing in a month .\nThe explanation for Trump 's angst over his predicament seems to lie in a flurry of startling and potentially significant developments and reports swirling around his jailed ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and other associates .\nJUST WATCHED Giuliani : Trump 'upset for weeks ' over Mueller squeezing Manafort Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Giuliani : Trump 'upset for weeks ' over Mueller squeezing Manafort 03:16\nTrump , the most powerful man in the world who crafted a self-flattering image as the ultimate strongman boss , is in a deeply vulnerable spot and appears to feel cornered and in increasing peril .\nHe has no choice but to watch as Mueller , an adversary whose discreet public profile makes him an elusive target , grinds away , apparently getting ever closer to Trump 's inner circle and perhaps even to the President himself .\n`` The Mueller investigation is what it is . It just goes on and on and on , '' Trump told The Washington Post Tuesday when asked about his relentless , unseen foe .\nTrump 's lawyer Rudy Giuliani offered a hint of the toll being inflicted on Trump behind the scenes when he told CNN 's Dana Bash the President had been `` upset for weeks '' about `` the un-American , horrible treatment of Manafort . ''\nWhile the White House refuses to budge from its denial of collusion between Trump and Russia in 2016 , a string of events now coming to light is stretching the notion that this is all one harmless coincidence to the limit of credulity .\nIn the space of a few days , it emerged that Manafort 's cooperation deal collapsed after Mueller accused him of lying on multiple occasions .\nThe Guardian reported on Tuesday that Manafort met Wikileaks founder Julian Assange , who is accused of blasting out emails stolen by Russian spies to attack Hillary Clinton , on a number of occasions in the Ecuadorian embassy in London . Both Manafort and Wikileaks have issued strenuous denials of the report -- Manafort called it `` totally false and deliberately libelous '' and Wikileaks was `` willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor 's head that Manafort never met Assange . ''\nThe paper 's sourcing was also vague , making it difficult to assess the veracity of the reporting . So for now , joining the dots can not produce definitive conclusions .\nCNN later obtained draft court documents Tuesday with which Mueller plans to show how Trump associate Roger Stone allegedly sought information and emails from Wikileaks using another operative , Jerome Corsi , as a go between .\nIn another development , CNN contributor Carl Bernstein reported Tuesday that Mueller 's team has been investigating a meeting between Manafort and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno in Quito in 2017 and has specifically asked if WikiLeaks or Assange was discussed in the meeting , according to a source with personal knowledge of the matter .\nSuch is the secrecy around Mueller 's investigation that no one outside knows what he knows . The special counsel has yet to lay out any case against Trump or his close associates on either alleged collusion or obstruction of justice .\nIf there is such supporting evidence , it is not clear that Mueller would be able to prove malicious intent by Trump . But all of the recent developments suggest that the special counsel has penetrated deeply into the events surrounding the troubled 2016 election .\nIn his dismissal of a cooperation agreement with Manafort , for instance , Mueller 's team said it has evidence to prove the former lobbyist lied `` on a variety of subject matters '' -- a fact that alone must leave Trump wondering about the extent of his knowledge .\nThere was immediate speculation that Manafort 's apparent attempts to mislead Mueller amounted to an implicit plea for a pardon from the President . The White House said there had been no talk of such a step . But adding to speculation that Manafort is angling for a pardon , Giuliani told Bash that the two legal teams had been in contact . This also raised the possibility that Trump has a genuine window into Mueller 's progress , another factor that might explain his recent anger .\nThe New York Times reported that the cooperation between the two legal teams had inflamed tensions between the special counsel and Manafort 's lawyers .\nFormer Watergate special prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste told CNN 's Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that if the report of Manafort-Assange meetings was correct it would be extraordinary .\n`` What in the world would Mr. Manafort be doing meeting with Julian Assange if not to talk about Assange 's role as a cut out for disseminating information the Russians obtained by illegal hacking ? '' Ben-Veniste said .\nIt was not clear whether Manafort 's alleged lies dealt with the reported meeting with Assange . But given that the fugitive Australian is confined to his hideaway in the embassy , he or his hosts are likely under surveillance , intelligence that Mueller would likely be able to access .\nMueller is not the only potential threat to the President interested in the deepening questions .
