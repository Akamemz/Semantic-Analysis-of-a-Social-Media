Political consultant Mark McKinnon , a former advisor to Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) and former President George W.

Former Bush aide Karen Hughes is of counsel .\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke and former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman , all founding members of the CLC , have also signed on to the new effort .\nSo far , funders include Exelon , the operator of America \u2019 s largest nuclear fleet , First Solar , and the American Wind Energy Association . Four big oil companies , Exxon Mobil , BP , Royal Dutch Shell , and Total SA supported the CLC proposal and are said to be mulling donations to AFCD .\nYou might think a coalition of Bush-era lobbyists and big energy corporations pushing a carbon tax would raise some suspicion , but reaction from the center-left establishment and the mainstream press has been positively glowing .

It is first and foremost a bid by oil and gas and nuclear to secure the gentlest and most predictable possible energy transition .\nMore broadly , it is the US Climate Action Partnership all over again . That was the effort , starting around 2006 , to develop a climate bill that big , polluting industries would support .

And the tax-and-dividend idea is certainly simpler than cap-and-trade . But the biggest mistake of the 2008-era climate policy push was not the policy , it was the belief that corporate support is the key to climate policy .\nClimate activists in 2006 couldn \u2019 t have understood the political situation into which their policy would be released , but there \u2019 s no such excuse today . The fact is that the political model ACCD represents \u2014 start in the Very Sensible Bipartisan Center and expand from there \u2014 hasn \u2019 t been fruitful for many years in the US . ( Here \u2019 s great piece on that subject . ) There \u2019 s certainly no reason to think it will work better any time soon .\nThis is oil , gas , and nuclear making their opening bid on climate policy\nAnyone who has followed the careers of Trent Lott and John Breaux \u2014 former leaders of the Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats respectively \u2014 knows that they are creatures of a bygone era . Bipartisanship has been declining in the US for decades , but its last redoubt was the kind of bipartisanship Lott and Breaux represented , i.e. , the purely transactional , corporate-friendly kind .\nFrom the moment they left the Senate , they \u2019 ve been lobbying , first at their own firm , the Breaux\u2013Lott Leadership Group , and now at Squire Patton Boggs , which has represented everything from Shell to solar companies .\nIn fact , Lott , who resigned from his leadership position in disgrace after praising segregationist Strom Thurmond \u2019 s run for president , left the Senate early in part to avoid the recently passed Honest Leadership and Open Government Act , which would have prevented him from lobbying for two years after leaving the Senate .\nThis new PAC is a pure industry effort , a coalition of energy groups from almost every big energy sector except coal , backed by industry-friend lobbyists .\nThere are two ways for climate-concerned folk on the left to react to something like this . One is to think , gosh , climate change is such a compelling and urgent problem that even oil companies and lobbyists have seen the error of their ways . And if they \u2019 re willing to help , gosh , we should make every effort to meet them halfway ! Let \u2019 s signal that we \u2019 re eager to compromise .\nThis is the way of the Very Sensible Centrist , an American political creature that rarely produces tangible results , but always garners heaps of praise . Many center-left Dems view it as the sine qua non of politics .\nBut it \u2019 s utterly disconnected from anything going on in US politics right now . It \u2019 s a fantasy , a trip to la-la land . It amounts to a kind of enforced naivety that centrists too often mistake for virtue .\nAnother way to react might be to see the industry bid through the lens of power , to think about how to get more and better . Oil companies are giving ground ? Push harder . That \u2019 s what Republicans would do .\nTo understand the political economy of a carbon tax , it helps to understand the motivations of the industries involved , which do not always overlap . It \u2019 s easy to understand why coal wouldn \u2019 t endorse a carbon tax , and why wind and solar would . Oil and gas and nuclear and more interesting cases .\nThe oil and gas industry is trying to get ahead of the climate policy curve\nFirst , US climate policy now seems inevitable . Even though it has been kept bottled up in Congress , and Trump is now squashing it at the federal agency level , it is busting out all over in states and cities , some of which are making plans to switch to 100 percent renewable electricity and ban gas and diesel cars in a few decades , among many other diverse initiatives .\nFederally , there \u2019 s still the danger that Obama regulations like the Clean Power Plan could survive Trump \u2019 s crude attempts to overturn them . ( See Mike Grunwald on \u201c the myth of Scott Pruitt \u2019 s EPA rollback . \u201d )\nOverall , it makes for an extremely volatile and unpredictable policy environment \u2014 or rather , dozens of disparate policy environments . And oil and gas companies know that Trump won \u2019 t be in power forever . Democrats will return to federal power eventually , and when they do , they will have an appetite for bold climate policy .\nBasically , oil and gas sees a big wave of climate policies building . That is what Lott meant when he told the Wall Street Journal that \u201c the tide is turning on the realization that something needs to be done in this area. \u201d He didn \u2019 t mean \u201c we \u2019 ve been doing some reading and realized we were terribly wrong. \u201d He meant \u201c the jig is up . \u201d\nThus the inclusion of two key provisions in the AFCD proposal .\nFirst , EPA regulations meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , like the Clean Power Plan , would be revoked , allegedly rendered unnecessary . ( It \u2019 s unclear exactly which regulations are included . ) And second , energy companies would be given immunity to climate-based lawsuits like several currently underway , a provision climate activists are certain to oppose .\nIn short , this proposal would radically simplify the federal climate policy landscape , giving oil and gas lobbyists a single target . And oil and gas would use it to argue against further policy at the state level .\nThe second political consideration for oil and gas companies is even more mercenary . Under any economy-wide carbon tax , it will be coal that \u2019 s hit first and hardest . And what \u2019 s bad for coal is good for natural gas , at least in the short-term . Especially absent further policy , a price on carbon will leave oil quite healthy for quite some time . Oil and gas don \u2019 t have to be faster than the bear \u2014 they just have to be faster than coal .\nAs for nuclear , it faces some urgent short-term problems . It is in a tough spot in the US , with several plants closing . Currently , it is stuck in an unsavory marriage of convenience with coal , begging for federal bailouts for \u201c baseload \u201d plants in the name of \u201c resiliency , \u201d a transparently fraudulent case that is winning the industry no friends .\nFrom both a long-term strategic and short-term PR perspective , the nuclear industry would much rather be in an alliance with oil and gas , pushing for a price on carbon , which is the one policy that could truly save its bacon . That way , it can look virtuous and environmental instead of grubby and desperate .\nThis is not an attempt by Republicans to get Republicans in Congress to pass climate legislation .\nBush-era Republicans are out of favor in the party . These lobbyists know as well as anyone else that there is absolutely zero chance that today \u2019 s Republican Party will be involved in the passage of a new tax , a thing it hates above all else , to address a problem it views as a liberal fantasy .\nToday the establishment press ( once again ) fell for an old line .\nEvery single Republican in congress has voted to `` never '' pass a carbon tax .\nGOP platform opposes same . \u2014 Grover Norquist ( @ GroverNorquist ) June 20 , 2018\nSo what \u2019 s the point of the proposal ? The calculation is that eventually Democrats will be in power again , but their majorities will be narrow and their chance at substantial legislation will be fleeting . In that circumstance , they will need some Republican votes to overcome a filibuster and pass anything big . Those few Republican \u201c moderates \u201d \u2014 assuming anything by that name still exists \u2014 will have enormous power to set an upper bound on the effort \u2019 s ambitions .\nIn other words , it will be 2008 all over again .\nThis proposal is a signal to Democrats and center-leftists that tax-and-dividend is the Respectable Middle , a good-faith starting point for bipartisan debate . Democrats don \u2019 t really have a clear sense of their own climate policy preferences at the moment , so a certain faction of the party is certain to embrace the opportunity to be \u201c reasonable \u201d about it .\nOf course , any tax that passes through any conceivable Congress will not end up looking like nice , clean cap-and-dividend program . It will get larded up with favors to win over various constituencies . Such is democracy . But precisely detailing the policy is not the point .\nAbove all , the point is to establish a simple principle as the starting point for debate : no carbon revenue should go to the government or be spent by the government . \u201c The dividend changes everything , \u201d Lott told the WSJ , in the story \u2019 s most revealing quote . \u201c The money goes back to the people instead of into the dark , deep hole of the federal government . \u201d\nThis is a message to Democrats : In the event you need the support of Big Oil and a few transactional Republicans to pass climate policy , our baseline is no revenue to the government , no new spending , no other climate regulations , no climate lawsuits .\nThis proposal is \u201c bipartisan \u201d in that it lacks support from both parties\nThe non-profit , James Baker-led CLC is \u201c bipartisan \u201d in the very odd DC usage of the term , which is that a tiny handful of Republicans and Democrats support it , while vast swathes of both parties have every reason to hate it .\nThe reasons for Republican opposition are obvious enough . But what about Democrats , who actually care about climate change ? Will they go for it ?\nThere are two possible reasons they might support a proposal like this : a ) it \u2019 s super popular and has a good chance of passing , or b ) it \u2019 s such good policy that it \u2019 s worth backing , even with long odds .\nThere \u2019 s no reason to think tax-and-dividend is the most popular climate policy\nThere is no evidence that pricing carbon \u2014 the climate policy with the most transparently punitive effects on average voters \u2014 is the most popular climate strategy . In practice , it has proven quite difficult . Virtually every wonk and analyst agrees that it \u2019 s important , but voters are voters , and they like supporting \u201c good \u201d s more than they like punishing \u201c bad \u201d s , especially when they \u2019 re the bads .\nA climate policy seeking popularity will foreground goods , like renewable energy , which everyone loves , and leave the taxing of bads in the background , as a funding mechanism .\nSimilarly , there \u2019 s not much evidence that dividends are the key to helping the medicine of carbon taxes go down . In surveys , the public generally prefers uses of carbon revenue that are targeted at reducing carbon , like support for renewable energy ( again : goods ) . That makes sense to people . Taking the money and then giving it back , in an endless game of bureaucratic whirligig , does not seem to grab them the way it grabs wonks .\nAFCD released a poll of its own ; its online survey of 2,000 likely voters showed support for tax-and-dividend at 56 to 26 percent . But the question was absurdly slanted in favor of the policy .\nAs you may know , some leading figures in the Republican party have proposed taxing fossil fuel companies on their carbon emissions and rebating all the money directly to all Americans through a monthly check . This new climate solution is called \u201d carbon dividends \u201d because all households would receive a monthly cash dividend as part of an effort to combat climate change . Would you favor or oppose this plan ?\nA climate \u201c solution \u201d Republicans support ? I \u2019 ll get a monthly check ? It sounds pretty good , floating there in isolation on an online survey !\nOf course , in the real world , voters will hear a few other salient facts . The \u201c leading figures \u201d are retired , out-of-power lobbyists . The GOP steadfastly opposes the policy , both institutionally and almost unanimously . The tax would ultimately fall on consumers , raising the cost of energy and everything that uses energy .\nThe New York Times says it \u2019 s a \u201c plan to fight climate change by taxing greenhouse gas emissions and giving the revenue to American taxpayers. \u201d What sense does it make to take money and then give it back ? Just to give bureaucrats something to do ? And who \u2019 s to say the government won \u2019 t grab the revenue for something else whenever it pleases ?\nThe attack ads write themselves . That \u2019 s probably why , for all its endlessly touted bipartisan appeal , no actual bipartisan carbon tax-and-dividend bill has passed anywhere .\nWell , okay , but is it good policy , worth dying on a hill for ?\nFirst off , there \u2019 s no way to judge the CLC as a carbon-reduction policy , because the rate of increase in the tax isn \u2019 t defined . There \u2019 s literally no way to know what effect it would have on carbon emissions .\nCLC is pushing this study , which is written by a guy who \u201c has worked at every level of the coal and oil and gas industries \u201d and a guy who was previously at the National Association of Manufacturers , which purports to show that the CLC plan would reduce carbon almost twice as much as Obama regulations by 2025 .\nOf course , the relevant comparison is not CLC vs. Obama regulations , it \u2019 s CLC vs. competing climate policy proposals . But more to the point , the authors of the study simply stipulate an escalation rate of 3 to 5 percent a year \u2014 the CLC council \u201c has not yet settled on a final escalation rate . \u201d\nContrast that to a similar proposal ( albeit one that would leave EPA regulations in place ) from Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( RI ) , which he reintroduced last year . Whitehouse says :\nOur bill sets the 2018 fee per ton of carbon emitted at $ 49 , the central range of the social cost of carbon last estimated by the Office of Management and Budget . That fee would increase each year at a real 2 percent until emissions fall 80 percent below 2005 levels , and then follow inflation .\nClear enough ! ( The bill , also a dividend plan , was a bit of outreach to Republicans . The results were predictable to everyone , possibly including Whitehouse . )\nIt \u2019 s unclear how fast the ACFD tax is meant to rise , and so unclear what it would do . \u201c If the language says the tax will increase over time without defining the actual increase , \u201d Robbie Orvis , director of energy policy design at Energy Innovation , told me , \u201c the long-term economic and emissions effect of this tax are impossible to accurately predict . \u201d\nA future Congress will determine both the level of the tax and the rate of escalation , which means it will determine the strength of the proposal \u2014 and there \u2019 s no way to know how strong it is until then .\nMeanwhile , using all the revenue on dividends leaves none for anything else . It leaves none for the myriad infrastructure , R & D , and transition assistance programs that will be needed to address climate change . And it leaves none to use to secure political support from diverse Democratic constituencies , all of whom have their own parochial interests in climate policy .\nThe political gamble is that the broad public appeal of dividends will overwhelm the power of interest groups , but that is almost entirely a matter of faith , not evidence .\nFor those who believe in the power of a price on carbon , dividends are a somewhat arbitrary bottom line . \u201c Putting a price on the uninternalized cost of greenhouse gas emissions via some sort of tax is the goal , \u201d Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center told me . \u201c What we do with the revenue from that tax is an entirely separate question that will largely be determined by the political bargaining required to get a meaningful carbon tax across the legislative finish line . \u201d\nThere is certainly nothing magic about the dividend , such that it \u2019 s worth surrendering other climate policies ( and constituencies ) to get it .\nSo there \u2019 s no real political , pragmatic case for what AFCD wants . But beyond the narrow pragmatic considerations ... screw this stuff .\nThere are all kinds of assumptions buried in CLC \u2019 s policy that climate hawks should reject .\nFirst : that a price on carbon is a replacement for other carbon regulations .\nA price on carbon would be a welcome backdrop and accelerant to other decarbonization and just-transition policies . I scarcely know a soul who opposes carbon pricing as such . But a price on carbon is not a substitute for those other policies .\nSecond : that a price on carbon should be \u201c revenue neutral , \u201d i.e. , that all the revenue should be returned automatically to taxpayers .\nIt certainly makes sense to use a portion of the revenue to shield middle- and low-income taxpayers from the regressive effects of a carbon tax . But that leaves plenty of revenue left over . And it \u2019 s a good thing , because adequately addressing climate change in the time remaining is going to involve lots of spending \u2014 infrastructure , RD & D , retrofit and efficiency programs , adaptation , the list goes on .\nMore broadly , the federal government is not a \u201c dark , deep hole. \u201d It can and must be a force for good if there \u2019 s to be any hope of decarbonization . We have lots of collective needs , and we should pay for them collectively , through taxes . Liberals have got to stop acceding to the toxic premise that government is bad .\nThird : carbon policy should be \u201c deficit neutral , \u201d i.e. , it should spend only what it collects in revenue .\nA tax on carbon might be good climate policy in its own right , but there \u2019 s no reason it should set a limit on climate spending . Deficit spending in the name of building long-term low-carbon infrastructure makes all the economic sense in the world .\nDemocrats were suckers to ever adopt \u201c pay-for \u201d requirements , which end up being a one-way ratchet , constraining progressive policy but never , ever constraining the GOP \u2019 s deficit-funded tax cuts . Dems should ditch them , in climate policy above all else .\nClimate change is a big problem that \u2019 s going to involve a bunch of different policies at all levels of government \u2014 taxing , spending , regulating , all of it . Conservative dogma has been a disaster for the US . It is unbelievable that some Democrats , in the name of showing how darn reasonable they are , are accepting versions of that dogma as a starting point for climate negotiations .\nA price on carbon is a fine thing . But climate hawks should be designing their policies around the real political economy , in which multiple goals and strategies must be pursued at once . They need policies that make clean energy cheap , policies that address the plethora of market failures ( which include far more than unpriced carbon ) , policies that help change public attitudes , policies that shelter vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate , and yes , policies that reshape markets to value carbon . All of it .\nMaking things tidy and predictable for giant energy companies is just not a top-tier consideration , much less a starting point .\nDemocrats don \u2019 t often act like it , but they are right on climate change . They \u2019 re on the right side of history . That \u2019 s why fossil fuel companies are reaching out to , ahem , \u201c end the impasse. \u201d It \u2019 s what you do when you \u2019 re losing .\nDems should have the courage of their convictions , support the policies they believe most able to pass and most likely to work , and begin negotiations there , not where fossil fuel lobbyists draw the line .",

And oil and gas would use it to argue against further policy at the state level.\n\nThe second political consideration for oil and gas companies is even more mercenary. Under any economy-wide carbon tax, it will be coal that\u2019s hit first and hardest. And what\u2019s bad for coal is good for natural gas, at least in the short-term. Especially absent further policy, a price on carbon will leave oil quite healthy for quite some time. Oil and gas don\u2019t have to be faster than the bear \u2014 they just have to be faster than coal.\n\nAs for nuclear, it faces some urgent short-term problems. It is in a tough spot in the US, with several plants closing. Currently, it is stuck in an unsavory marriage of convenience with coal, begging for federal bailouts for \u201cbaseload\u201d plants in the name of \u201cresiliency,\u201d a transparently fraudulent case that is winning the industry no friends.\n\nFrom both a long-term strategic and short-term PR perspective, the nuclear industry would much rather be in an alliance with oil and gas, pushing for a price on carbon, which is the one policy that could truly save its bacon. That way, it can look virtuous and environmental instead of grubby and desperate.\n\nThis proposal is aimed at Democrats, not Republicans\n\nThis is not an attempt by Republicans to get Republicans in Congress to pass climate legislation.\n\nBush-era Republicans are out of favor in the party. These lobbyists know as well as anyone else that there is absolutely zero chance that today\u2019s Republican Party will be involved in the passage of a new tax, a thing it hates above all else, to address a problem it views as a liberal fantasy.\n\nToday the establishment press (once again) fell for an old line.\n\nWSJ Headline: \"Conservative Group will push for Carbon Tax\"\n\nThey cite lobbyist Trent Lott as \"conservative\"\n\nEvery single Republican in congress has voted to \"never\" pass a carbon tax.\n\nGOP platform opposes same. \u2014 Grover Norquist (@GroverNorquist) June 20, 2018\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of the proposal? The calculation is that eventually Democrats will be in power again, but their majorities will be narrow and their chance at substantial legislation will be fleeting. In that circumstance, they will need some Republican votes to overcome a filibuster and pass anything big. Those few Republican \u201cmoderates\u201d \u2014 assuming anything by that name still exists \u2014 will have enormous power to set an upper bound on the effort\u2019s ambitions.\n\nIn other words, it will be 2008 all over again.\n\nThis proposal is a signal to Democrats and center-leftists that tax-and-dividend is the Respectable Middle, a good-faith starting point for bipartisan debate. Democrats don\u2019t really have a clear sense of their own climate policy preferences at the moment, so a certain faction of the party is certain to embrace the opportunity to be \u201creasonable\u201d about it.\n\nOf course, any tax that passes through any conceivable Congress will not end up looking like nice, clean cap-and-dividend program. It will get larded up with favors to win over various constituencies. Such is democracy. But precisely detailing the policy is not the point.\n\nAbove all, the point is to establish a simple principle as the starting point for debate: no carbon revenue should go to the government or be spent by the government. \u201cThe dividend changes everything,\u201d Lott told the WSJ, in the story\u2019s most revealing quote. \u201cThe money goes back to the people instead of into the dark, deep hole of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThis is a message to Democrats: In the event you need the support of Big Oil and a few transactional Republicans to pass climate policy, our baseline is no revenue to the government, no new spending, no other climate regulations, no climate lawsuits.\n\nThis proposal is \u201cbipartisan\u201d in that it lacks support from both parties\n\nThe non-profit, James Baker-led CLC is \u201cbipartisan\u201d in the very odd DC usage of the term, which is that a tiny handful of Republicans and Democrats support it, while vast swathes of both parties have every reason to hate it.\n\nThe reasons for Republican opposition are obvious enough. But what about Democrats, who actually care about climate change? Will they go for it?\n\nThere are two possible reasons they might support a proposal like this: a) it\u2019s super popular and has a good chance of passing, or b) it\u2019s such good policy that it\u2019s worth backing, even with long odds.\n\nBut neither is true.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to think tax-and-dividend is the most popular climate policy\n\nThere is no evidence that pricing carbon \u2014 the climate policy with the most transparently punitive effects on average voters \u2014 is the most popular climate strategy. In practice, it has proven quite difficult. Virtually every wonk and analyst agrees that it\u2019s important, but voters are voters, and they like supporting \u201cgood\u201ds more than they like punishing \u201cbad\u201ds, especially when they\u2019re the bads.\n\nA climate policy seeking popularity will foreground goods, like renewable energy, which everyone loves, and leave the taxing of bads in the background, as a funding mechanism.\n\nSimilarly, there\u2019s not much evidence that dividends are the key to helping the medicine of carbon taxes go down. In surveys, the public generally prefers uses of carbon revenue that are targeted at reducing carbon, like support for renewable energy (again: goods). That makes sense to people. Taking the money and then giving it back, in an endless game of bureaucratic whirligig, does not seem to grab them the way it grabs wonks.\n\nAFCD released a poll of its own; its online survey of 2,000 likely voters showed support for tax-and-dividend at 56 to 26 percent. But the question was absurdly slanted in favor of the policy.\n\nAs you may know, some leading figures in the Republican party have proposed taxing fossil fuel companies on their carbon emissions and rebating all the money directly to all Americans through a monthly check. This new climate solution is called \u201dcarbon dividends\u201d because all households would receive a monthly cash dividend as part of an effort to combat climate change. Would you favor or oppose this plan?\n\nA climate \u201csolution\u201d Republicans support? I\u2019ll get a monthly check? It sounds pretty good, floating there in isolation on an online survey!\n\nOf course, in the real world, voters will hear a few other salient facts. The \u201cleading figures\u201d are retired, out-of-power lobbyists. The GOP steadfastly opposes the policy, both institutionally and almost unanimously. The tax would ultimately fall on consumers, raising the cost of energy and everything that uses energy.\n\nThe New York Times says it\u2019s a \u201cplan to fight climate change by taxing greenhouse gas emissions and giving the revenue to American taxpayers.\u201d What sense does it make to take money and then give it back? Just to give bureaucrats something to do? And who\u2019s to say the government won\u2019t grab the revenue for something else whenever it pleases?\n\nThe attack ads write themselves. That\u2019s probably why, for all its endlessly touted bipartisan appeal, no actual bipartisan carbon tax-and-dividend bill has passed anywhere.\n\nWell, okay, but is it good policy, worth dying on a hill for?\n\nMeh.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s no way to judge the CLC as a carbon-reduction policy, because the rate of increase in the tax isn\u2019t defined. There\u2019s literally no way to know what effect it would have on carbon emissions.\n\nCLC is pushing this study, which is written by a guy who \u201chas worked at every level of the coal and oil and gas industries\u201d and a guy who was previously at the National Association of Manufacturers, which purports to show that the CLC plan would reduce carbon almost twice as much as Obama regulations by 2025.\n\nOf course, the relevant comparison is not CLC vs. Obama regulations, it\u2019s CLC vs. competing climate policy proposals. But more to the point, the authors of the study simply stipulate an escalation rate of 3 to 5 percent a year \u2014 the CLC council \u201chas not yet settled on a final escalation rate.\u201d\n\nContrast that to a similar proposal (albeit one that would leave EPA regulations in place) from Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), which he reintroduced last year. Whitehouse says:\n\nOur bill sets the 2018 fee per ton of carbon emitted at $49, the central range of the social cost of carbon last estimated by the Office of Management and Budget. That fee would increase each year at a real 2 percent until emissions fall 80 percent below 2005 levels, and then follow inflation.\n\nClear enough! (The bill, also a dividend plan, was a bit of outreach to Republicans. The results were predictable to everyone, possibly including Whitehouse.)\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how fast the ACFD tax is meant to rise, and so unclear what it would do. \u201cIf the language says the tax will increase over time without defining the actual increase,\u201d Robbie Orvis, director of energy policy design at Energy Innovation, told me, \u201cthe long-term economic and emissions effect of this tax are impossible to accurately predict.\u201d\n\nA future Congress will determine both the level of the tax and the rate of escalation, which means it will determine the strength of the proposal \u2014 and there\u2019s no way to know how strong it is until then.\n\nMeanwhile, using all the revenue on dividends leaves none for anything else. It leaves none for the myriad infrastructure, R&D, and transition assistance programs that will be needed to address climate change. And it leaves none to use to secure political support from diverse Democratic constituencies, all of whom have their own parochial interests in climate policy.\n\nThe political gamble is that the broad public appeal of dividends will overwhelm the power of interest groups, but that is almost entirely a matter of faith, not evidence.\n\nFor those who believe in the power of a price on carbon, dividends are a somewhat arbitrary bottom line. \u201cPutting a price on the uninternalized cost of greenhouse gas emissions via some sort of tax is the goal,\u201d Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center told me. \u201cWhat we do with the revenue from that tax is an entirely separate question that will largely be determined by the political bargaining required to get a meaningful carbon tax across the legislative finish line.\u201d\n\nThere is certainly nothing magic about the dividend, such that it\u2019s worth surrendering other climate policies (and constituencies) to get it.\n\nSo there\u2019s no real political, pragmatic case for what AFCD wants. But beyond the narrow pragmatic considerations ... screw this stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s time to quit pre-capitulating to garbage policy\n\nThere are all kinds of assumptions buried in CLC\u2019s policy that climate hawks should reject.\n\nFirst: that a price on carbon is a replacement for other carbon regulations.\n\nNo, it isn\u2019t.\n\nA price on carbon would be a welcome backdrop and accelerant to other decarbonization and just-transition policies. I scarcely know a soul who opposes carbon pricing as such. But a price on carbon is not a substitute for those other policies.\n\nSecond: that a price on carbon should be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d i.e., that all the revenue should be returned automatically to taxpayers.\n\nNo, it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nIt certainly makes sense to use a portion of the revenue to shield middle- and low-income taxpayers from the regressive effects of a carbon tax. But that leaves plenty of revenue left over. And it\u2019s a good thing, because adequately addressing climate change in the time remaining is going to involve lots of spending \u2014 infrastructure, RD&D, retrofit and efficiency programs, adaptation, the list goes on.\n\nMore broadly, the federal government is not a \u201cdark, deep hole.\u201d It can and must be a force for good if there\u2019s to be any hope of decarbonization. We have lots of collective needs, and we should pay for them collectively, through taxes. Liberals have got to stop acceding to the toxic premise that government is bad.\n\nThird: carbon policy should be \u201cdeficit neutral,\u201d i.e., it should spend only what it collects in revenue.\n\nNo, it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nA tax on carbon might be good climate policy in its own right, but there\u2019s no reason it should set a limit on climate spending. Deficit spending in the name of building long-term low-carbon infrastructure makes all the economic sense in the world.\n\nDemocrats were suckers to ever adopt \u201cpay-for\u201d requirements, which end up being a one-way ratchet, constraining progressive policy but never, ever constraining the GOP\u2019s deficit-funded tax cuts. Dems should ditch them, in climate policy above all else.\n\nClimate change is a big problem that\u2019s going to involve a bunch of different policies at all levels of government \u2014 taxing, spending, regulating, all of it. Conservative dogma has been a disaster for the US. It is unbelievable that some Democrats, in the name of showing how darn reasonable they are, are accepting versions of that dogma as a starting point for climate negotiations.\n\nA price on carbon is a fine thing. But climate hawks should be designing their policies around the real political economy, in which multiple goals and strategies must be pursued at once. They need policies that make clean energy cheap, policies that address the plethora of market failures (which include far more than unpriced carbon), policies that help change public attitudes, policies that shelter vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate, and yes, policies that reshape markets to value carbon. All of it.\n\nMaking things tidy and predictable for giant energy companies is just not a top-tier consideration, much less a starting point.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t often act like it, but they are right on climate change. They\u2019re on the right side of history. That\u2019s why fossil fuel companies are reaching out to, ahem, \u201cend the impasse.\u201d It\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re losing.\n\nDems should have the courage of their convictions, support the policies they believe most able to pass and most likely to work, and begin negotiations there, not where fossil fuel lobbyists draw the line.",
