It encapsulates all our other divides \u2014 by race , education , religion and more \u2014 and it \u2019 s growing .\nThis partisan divide is such a big part of people \u2019 s political identities , in fact , that it \u2019 s reinforced simply by \u201c negative partisanship , \u201d or loyalty to a party because you don \u2019 t like the other party . A Pew Research Center poll from last year found that about 40 percent of both Democrats and Republicans belong to their party because they oppose the other party \u2019 s values , rather than because they are particularly aligned with their own party .\nBut what if Americans \u2019 views of the parties , particularly whichever one they don \u2019 t belong to , are , well , kind of wrong ? That \u2019 s the argument of a study by scholars Douglas Ahler and Gaurav Sood that was recently published in The Journal of Politics . They had the polling firm YouGov ask American adults to estimate the size of groups in each party . For example , what percentage of Democrats are black , or lesbian , gay or bisexual ? What percentage of Republicans earn more than $ 250,000 a year , or are age 65 or older ?\nWhat they found was that Americans overall are fairly misinformed about who is in each major party \u2014 and that members of each party are even more misinformed about who is in the other party .\nHow the parties see each other Based on polling from March 2015 How many Democrats are \u2026 Actual share Estimated by Republicans Difference Agnostics or atheists 9 % 36 % +27 Black 24 46 +22 LBG 6 38 +32 Union members 11 44 +33 How many Republicans are \u2026 Actual share Estimated by Democrats Difference 65 or older 21 % 44 % +23 Evangelicals 34 44 +10 Southerners 36 44 +8 Earning $ 250K or more a year 2 44 +42 Ahler and Sood confirmed the 44 percent across Republican categories estimated by Democrats .

The actual share was 2 percent .\nPeople also overstated the numbers of these stereotypical groups within their own party \u2014 Democrats thought 29 percent of their fellow Democrats were gay , lesbian or bisexual \u2014 but they weren \u2019 t off by as much as members of the other party .\nIn short , \u201c the parties in our heads , \u201d as Ahler and Sood write , are not the parties in real life .\nYou might say , \u201c This is just one study. \u201d And it is . I suspect that some of these results just show Americans \u2019 innumeracy \u2014 most blacks are Democratic-leaning , but most Democratic voters are not black . But I wanted to highlight this research in part because I think it speaks to the political moment we are in , and the study \u2019 s findings fit well with other recent research on political polarization . Lilliana Mason , a political scientist at the University of Maryland , published a book earlier this year that I highly recommend called \u201c Uncivil Agreement : How Politics Became Our Identity. \u201d In describing American politics today , she argues that partisan identity ( Democrat or Republican ) has become a \u201c mega-identity \u201d because it increasingly combines a number of different identities .\n\u201c A single vote can now indicate a person \u2019 s partisan preference as well as his or her religion , race , ethnicity , gender , neighborhood and favorite grocery store .

But if you told them that you are a Republican , they could reasonably assume that you are not black , lesbian , gay , transgender or bisexual , nonreligious or Jewish . They could also assume that you don \u2019 t live in Washington , D.C. , and that you don \u2019 t believe racial discrimination is the primary reason blacks aren \u2019 t making more advances in today \u2019 s America . If you told them you are a Democrat , they would have good reason to believe that you are not a white evangelical Christian and don \u2019 t live in coal country in Kentucky .
