He said that punishing Tehran for violating United Nations Security Council restrictions on ballistic missile testing was \u201c the right thing to do , \u201d and argued that the sanctions were already beginning to constrain Iranian aggression . Iran , he said , was trying to undermine and destabilize U.S. allies by exporting sensitive technology to countries \u201c around the world \u201d and that such aggressive conduct had to be countered . The sanctions were already working , he asserted . \u201c Have you noticed they \u2019 ve been very quiet in the last two days ? \u201d\nTrump made these and other comments in a conversation with three journalists whom he had invited to join him after the 60th annual International Red Cross ball , a fundraiser for the charity that was held this year at his club , Mar-a-Lago .\nIn his first trip back to his home in Palm Beach since becoming president , Trump answered several questions on wide-ranging topics from this reporter , Christopher Ruddy , founder and chief of Newsmax Media , and Melanie Dickinson , president and publisher of the South Florida Business Journal , an online and print business publication . Trump and his wife Melania lingered on after the ball to mix with admirers and some of the estimated 800 Red Cross supporters attending the black-tie event at Mar-a-lago , which has become known as \u201c The Winter White House . \u201d\nWhile wealthy supporters of the charity rubbed shoulders with one another and clustered around the table occupied by Trump and his wife , eager to congratulate him and take photos with First Couple , some 4,000 people turned out for an anti-Trump march in West Palm Beach . Hundreds of protesters made their way from Trump Tower in West Palm Beach to a staging area near Palm Beach on Bingham Island , and then to the entrance of the exclusive club , where they shouted anti-Trump slogans and yelled chants against the new administration \u2019 s policies . Many of the protesters , most of whom were peaceful , carried placards criticizing Trump , his immigration and other policies , and several of his wealthy Cabinet nominees . The protest was among the largest , if not the largest , in recent Palm Beach county history .\nInside the huge ornate ballroom , Trump seemed particularly insistent on disputing the notion that his travel restrictions now being challenged by several courts were unpopular . \u201c They \u2019 re very popular , \u201d he insisted . But , he added , he would have imposed them whether or not Americans approved of them . \u201c I \u2019 m not doing it for popularity . I \u2019 m doing it because our country is like a sieve for people coming in , \u201d he said .\nHe said that he had learned in his meetings with FBI officials that the bureau was having a difficult time staffing the more than 1,000 investigations it was conducting into potential threats to the country . \u201c There \u2019 s no manpower to do them . \u201d\nCalls to FBI headquarters regarding the number of ongoing terror investigations were not returned on this Super Bowl Sunday .
