And I think it \u2019 s very clear that the answer is \u2018 Oh sh [ bleep ] t , we \u2019 re in trouble. \u2019 Now , for people who are saying , \u2018 Well , stop pointing fingers at the President . Left-wing media is being too hard. \u2019 No . Shut up . No . This is inarguably , inarguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government . Now , now , this is , remember when Bill Clinton , I don \u2019 t know if you remember this , when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky ? That was inarguably a failure of judgment at the top . Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for this behavior . I believe Republicans are in the same position right now .

And you dismiss any criticism as further evidence of how the rest of the media persecute you . You like to pretend , Bernie Goldberg and Fox News , that the relentless conservative activism of Fox News is the equivalent , oh the equivalent , of the disorganized liberal influence you find on NBC , ABC and CBS . But Fox News , you may be able to detect a liberal pathogen in their blood stream , however faint . But Fox News is such a crazy overreaction to that perceived threat . You \u2019 re like an auto-immune disorder . I \u2019 m not saying the virus doesn \u2019 t exist in some small quantity . But you \u2019 re producing way too many antibodies .

Because then we \u2019 d have do something about it . If there is one man who embodied the ethos of the Republican party in this regard , I \u2019 d have to say , it \u2019 s our old friend Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama . Never met a war appropriations bill he didn \u2019 t like . Happy to spend the money overseas . \u201d\nSenator Jeff Sessions : \u201c We need to resist the temptation to create more entitlements and more entitlements , which is one of the reasons that we \u2019 re heading recklessly to a fiscal crisis . But I don \u2019 t think we should create a blank check , an unlimited entitlement program now . \u201d\nStewart : \u201c Go f * * * yourself . You know what , I \u2019 m worried . I \u2019 m really worried about the Republicans . Their inability to wean themselves off of military intervention .

I can make the show out of that . What \u2019 s the other story ?\nCharlie Rose : \u201c The controversial shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin one month ago in Sanford , Florida . \u201d\nStewart : \u201c Dick Cheney got a new heart ! ( Laughs ) That \u2019 s the headline . Oh , the headline is Dick Cheney got a new heart . You know , I \u2019 m sure by the way that is a very different headline in the organ community . Probably something like innocent heart sentenced to life in Cheney . Boom ! Boom ! I \u2019 m going to get to do a ton of these today. \u201d .\nStewart : \u201c Heart transplant ! Isn \u2019 t more of a heart plant when you don \u2019 t have an original ? Hey , I think we have a clip of Cheney selecting the organ ! \u201d\nStewart : \u201c He \u2019 s-He \u2019 s-Dick Cheney \u2019 s not a nice man ... Are you ( beep ) ? Hey , everybody , here \u2019 s my impression of Dick Cheney \u2019 s surgeon removing Cheney \u2019 s original heart . Ah It bit me ! Oh my god ! Why does a human heart have fangs ? \u201d\n\u2014Stewart on Comedy Central \u2019 s The Daily Show , March 26 , 2012 .\nJon Stewart : \u201c Is Dick Cheney a righteous warrior or a psychopath ? It \u2019 s one thing to feel remorseless vengeance against those who have wronged us . Which is why we \u2019 ve always been a nation that has followed the vigilante \u2019 s code - I \u2019 m sorry , rule of law . Rule of law . But what if , hypothetically , this treatment was perpetrated on someone who had been detained wrongly , surely that would soften Cheney \u2019 s Bronsonlike torture boner . \u201d\nStewart : \u201c But look , perhaps we \u2019 re being unfair . I \u2019 m not suggesting that Dick Cheney is using the terrible specter of what happened on 9/11 robotically as a cudgel to beat down argument , draining all emotion and meaning out of that terrible day as he uses it in service of avoiding culpability . Yeah , I \u2019 m not doing that . \u2019 \u201d\nStewart : \u201c You know what , just because he \u2019 s so bitter and angry doesn \u2019 t mean I have to be . I \u2019 m going to end on a note of gratitude , with something I never thought that I would say : George W. Bush , thank you for not dying while you were in office . \u201d\n\u2014 Stewart on Comedy Central \u2019 s The Daily Show , December 15 , 2014 .",

Isn\u2019t more of a heart plant when you don\u2019t have an original? Hey, I think we have a clip of Cheney selecting the organ!\u201d\n\n[Clip of someone removing a heart by hand]\n\nStewart: \u201cHe\u2019s-He\u2019s-Dick Cheney\u2019s not a nice man...Are you (beep)? Hey, everybody, here\u2019s my impression of Dick Cheney\u2019s surgeon removing Cheney\u2019s original heart. Ah It bit me! Oh my god! Why does a human heart have fangs?\u201d\n\n\u2014Stewart on Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show, March 26, 2012.\n\nStewart Accuses Cheney of Having a \u2018Bronsonlike Torture Boner\u2019\n\n\n\nJon Stewart: \u201cIs Dick Cheney a righteous warrior or a psychopath? It\u2019s one thing to feel remorseless vengeance against those who have wronged us. Which is why we\u2019ve always been a nation that has followed the vigilante\u2019s code - I\u2019m sorry, rule of law. Rule of law. But what if, hypothetically, this treatment was perpetrated on someone who had been detained wrongly, surely that would soften Cheney\u2019s Bronsonlike torture boner.\u201d\n\n...\n\nStewart: \u201cBut look, perhaps we\u2019re being unfair. I\u2019m not suggesting that Dick Cheney is using the terrible specter of what happened on 9/11 robotically as a cudgel to beat down argument, draining all emotion and meaning out of that terrible day as he uses it in service of avoiding culpability. Yeah, I\u2019m not doing that.\u2019\u201d\n\n...\n\nStewart: \u201cYou know what, just because he\u2019s so bitter and angry doesn\u2019t mean I have to be. I\u2019m going to end on a note of gratitude, with something I never thought that I would say: George W. Bush, thank you for not dying while you were in office.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Stewart on Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show, December 15, 2014.",
