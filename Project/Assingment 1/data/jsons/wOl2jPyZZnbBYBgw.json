    "content": "Last week , the Trump administration released the outline of an immigration plan meant to reshape how and which people are allowed into the United States . The plan would prioritize merit-based immigration and high-skilled labor over those who already have family here . Far from comprehensive or sufficient , it 's a modest improvement over the administration 's previous restrictive pushes .\nThe plan 's centerpiece is a shift toward a `` merit '' system very similar to those in place in Australia and Canada . The reform would boost skill-based immigration from 12 percent to 57 percent , while decreasing family-based and lottery-based immigration by 50 percent . This is great news for employers in the market for high-skilled workers . Indeed , the cap for H-1B visas ( for temporary , skilled workers ) and employment-based green cards has not increased for many years , while the U.S. workforce has grown by 38 million since these programs ' inception .\nDuring his testimony this week before the House Committee on Small Business , my colleague Daniel Griswold advised members of Congress that in order to better serve our booming economy\u2014especially the tech and health care industries but also future American businesses ( large and small ) \u2014increasing the number of high-skilled workers is key . He suggests tripling of the number of H-1B visas to 195,000 and doubling the 1990 cap of 140,000 of employment-based green cards .\nGriswold rightfully recommends that `` spouses and minor children of the primary green card worker should be exempt from the cap '' to preserve family units without taking away from our ability to attract more workers . Finally , he also suggests repealing the per-country quotas on green cards , which counterproductively discriminate against immigrants based on their country of origin .\nThe best feature of the Trump administration 's plan , however , is that it would maintain current immigration levels . While this may sound like a bad approach since we actually need more immigrants , it 's better than the administration 's previous proposals to cut legal immigration in half .\nIt is baffling that anyone would seriously call for cutting overall levels of immigration . As the great professor and economist Julian Simon used to assert , people are the ultimate resource and with more people come more brains and the promise of greater things to come .\nIt 's even more stunning to call for lower levels of immigration during an economic boom with the lowest unemployment rate in half a century .

This is true from high-skilled jobs in manufacturing to low-skilled ones in retail and the restaurant industries .\nAt the very least , for now , it appears that the president 's son-in-law Jared Kushner is the person behind the plan and has managed to squash this destructive idea . That said , this plan falls short in many ways .
