    "content": "President Trump , speaking in unusually somber tones , told Americans on Tuesday to brace for a \u201c very , very painful two weeks \u201d and begged them to stay at home as much as possible through April 30 , saying 100,000 to 200,000 people could die from COVID-19 despite his team \u2019 s best efforts to fight the coronavirus and that they want to depress that number .\nMr. Trump wanted to get the nation \u201c raring to go \u201d by Easter , but sobering models forced him to reverse course and plead with people to work and learn at home , avoid nonessential travel and stay out of restaurants for additional weeks .\n\u201c I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead , \u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House .\nThe president called for sacrifices as his coronavirus task force said the virus could kill far more Americans than car crashes or influenza do each year .\n\u201c As sobering a number as it is , we should be prepared for it , \u201d said Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .\nAdministration officials said the models are guided by epidemiology but aren \u2019 t gospel . Actual outcomes will be guided by human behavior .\nSocial distancing , a term that has become part of the lexicon , \u201c is going to be the answer to our problems , \u201d Dr. Fauci said .\nMr. Trump said social distancing is working , noting up to 2 million people might have died had the nation \u201c done nothing . \u201d\n\u201c A hundred thousand is , according to modeling , a very low number , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c I think we \u2019 re doing better than that . \u201d\nStill , the estimates are sobering \u2014 the notion of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities is double , triple or multitudes more than the number of deaths the U.S. would typically see from influenza and pneumonia in a given year .\nMr. Trump is contending with the fallout in a year in which he hoped to ride economic optimism to reelection in November .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a matter of life and death , frankly , it \u2019 s a matter of life and death , \u201d the president said . \u201c We had the greatest economy in the world . We had the best unemployment and employment numbers by far . \u201d\nThe sober tone is a turnabout for Mr. Trump , who one week ago pressed to open up businesses , noting the nation doesn \u2019 t shut down for other drivers of death .\n\u201c We lose thousands of people a year to the flu . We never turn the country off . We lose much more than that to automobile accidents . We didn \u2019 t call up the automobile companies and say , stop making cars .
