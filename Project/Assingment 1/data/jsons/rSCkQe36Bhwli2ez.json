Much like when purchasing any other good or service , students must evaluate what schools , and the associated loans , are feasible for them to commit to . When a student decides to take out a loan , he or she is doing so as an adult \u2014 or at the advice of parents , who are adults \u2014 entering into a voluntary and mutual agreement with a lender . Student loan forgiveness would serve only to reward students who recklessly borrowed tens of thousands without first evaluating their future ability to repay and punish those who chose a more fiscally responsible route .\nWhile many attribute the debt crisis to dishonest lenders and for-profit universities ( and to be fair , they do exist ) , a great deal of responsibility lies with students and families .

A significant shift toward options like state schools and community colleges would not only lower the average student debt but also incentivize the more expensive universities to adjust their prices to reflect the decrease in demand . Unfortunately , options like Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s student debt forgiveness plan do the exact opposite .\nReleased earlier this year , Warren \u2019 s plan proposes up to $ 50,000 of debt cancellation for each household with an annual income of less than $ 100,000 . In execution , this flawed approach will signal to universities and lenders that the majority of incoming students can plan to receive what essentially amounts to a $ 50,000 government voucher . Instead of lessening individual debt , it will incentivize students to view a $ 100,000 debt as a $ 50,000 debt , making them more willing to apply to pricier colleges and take out higher loans . This willingness will then encourage universities to raise their prices accordingly .\nThink about it another way : what if this plan were implemented in the housing market ? If a seller knew that an incoming buyer would be receiving $ 50,000 off his or her mortgage , the seller would be far less likely to lower the price , putting the buyer at a disadvantage . In Warren \u2019 s debt relief scenario , we would see the same disadvantage play out for incoming students .

As it stands , colleges get the payout from federal student loans , regardless of the quality of services they provide , incentivizing them to keep enrolling and indebting students , even if they aren \u2019 t succeeding in their academic programs .
