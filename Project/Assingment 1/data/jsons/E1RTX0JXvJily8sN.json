We can rule out zero , thanks to the decidedly alive Earth , which means that so far one is the answer . But if we discover another , the answer jumps straight past two to infinity . The reason : You can posit a universe in which the confluence of factors that made life possible here are so complex that the right roll of the dice could statistically happen only once . But if it can happen more than once , why should there be any limit ?
