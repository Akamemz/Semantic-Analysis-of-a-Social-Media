DeBartolo Jr., who built the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 1980s-\u201990s dynasty, was involved in one of the biggest owners\u2019 scandals in the sport\u2019s history. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony when he paid $400,000 to former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards in exchange for a riverboat gambling license. The White House announced the surprise decision to reporters on Tuesday, along with NFL greats Jerry Rice, Jim Brown, Ronnie Lott and Charles Haley. DeBartolo Jr., whose San Francisco 49ers won five Super Bowls under his leadership, stepped down as owner in 1997 after two Louisiana newspapers reported he would be indicted for gambling fraud. He avoided prison, was fined $1 million and was suspended for a year by the NFL. But the episode effectively ended his NFL career. Rice, an NFL Hall of Famer who played on three of DeBartolo\u2019s Super Bowl-winning teams, said DeBartolo \u201cwas like that 12th man\u201d of the great 49ers teams. \u201cHe\u2019s the main reason why we won so many Super Bowls,\u201d Rice said. \u201cSo today is a great day for him. I\u2019m glad to be here and be a part of that. It\u2019s just something I will never forget.
