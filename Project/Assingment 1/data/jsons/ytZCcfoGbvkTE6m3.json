    "content": "Promoting his latest column deriding Hillary Clinton for being chronically unethical and a lot like Richard Nixon , New York Times columnist Frank Bruni took to Twitter to suggest the Democrat 's campaign constituted \u201c psychological torture , \u201d which definitely sounds bad . Unsubtly headlined \u201c Hillary the Tormentor \u201d ( because she inflicts so much pain on Democrats , apparently ) , Bruni 's effort was unusually overwrought even by his dramatic standards .\nIn his column , the essayist outlined concerns from two nameless \u201c Democrats , \u201d who viewed Clinton as \u201c tainted \u201d and guilty of creating \u201c ugly , obvious messes. \u201d One source was so \u201c disgusted \u201d he wants \u201c never to lay eyes on [ Hillary ] and Bill again . \u201d\nTurns out that same day , fellow Times columnist Ross Douthat also made Clinton the focus of his column and he also dinged the candidate . Far less excited than Bruni 's effort , Douthat nonetheless made it clear that Democrats supporting Clinton should consider themselves \u201c warned \u201d for when things go terribly wrong if she 's elected president .\nSo on the same day , two different Times columnists attacking the Democratic frontrunner ; a candidate who enjoys historic and unprecedented support among the party 's faithful . It was just a case of bad timing for Clinton 's on the Times opinion pages , right ? Just a coincidence where not one but two columnists for the supposedly-liberal newspaper of record unloaded on her ?\nIn truth , the Bruni-Douthat tag team was a rather common occurrence among Times columnists , some of whom have banded together this year to publish a steady stream of attacks on Clinton . ( Yesterday , columnist David Brooks announced Clinton 's electoral strategy is all wrong , and that it 's bad for America . ) What 's unusual is that the conveyor belt of attacks has n't been balanced out by clear signs of Clinton support among Times columnists . More importantly , the Times ' odd brand of Clinton wrath has not been duplicated when columnists assess Republicans .\nSearching essays written by Times columnists this year , I ca n't find a one that unequivocally supports the Democratic frontrunner . ( There have been passing sentences and paragraphs of support , but nothing focused or thematic by columnists . ) By contrast , I can count more than two dozen that have focused on attacking her .\nIs the New York Times under any obligation to employ a columnist who supports Clinton ? Of course not . But it 's worth noting that Clinton enters this campaign season with more Democratic support than perhaps any non-incumbent frontrunner in recent party history , yet the New York Times has n't published an opinion column in support of her possibly historic run . ( The Times has published editorials backing parts of her agenda . )\nIncreasingly , the Times is facing criticism about its off-kilter Clinton coverage and its , at-times , odd obsession with the Democratic candidate . Is that attack-dog mentality also playing out on the opinion pages ?\nThe Times website lists eleven op-ed columnists who regularly contribute to the newspaper 's opinion pages , but not all of them write about politics . Of the eleven , seven are identified as being regular commentators on politics : Bruni , Douthat , Brooks , Gail Collins , Maureen Dowd , Charles Blow , and Paul Krugman . Of those seven , Douthat and Brooks clearly identify themselves as conservatives and so their lack of support for the Democratic frontrunner is n't surprising . ( Both men have cheered and encouraged Sen. Marco Rubio 's candidacy . )\nTogether , those seven have penned more than 200 columns this year , and nearly 40 of those mentioned Hillary Clinton at least three times , according to Nexis . Of those 40-odd columns , approximately two dozen focused lots of ( negative ) attention on Clinton . Note that in New York , Clinton remain an extraordinarily popular politician . But seemingly not among Times columnists . At least not yet .\nOne reason for the Times ' Clinton sympathy gap may be because liberal columnists Charles Blow and Paul Krugman have n't focused much of their newspaper attention this year on the still-distant primary season . In April , Krugman highlighted his contempt for the drawn-out campaign process and how little stock he puts in the media 's \u201c endless attempts to psychoanalyze \u201d candidates . \u201c Please pay no attention , \u201d he urged readers .\nOn his blog , Krugman earlier this year signaled his ongoing skepticism regarding over-excited media assaults against Bill and Hillary Clinton , and how they often amount to little more than empty , partisan Republican attacks amplified by the press .\nBut again , presidential campaigns are the big leagues , right ? So what 's wrong with Times columnists throwing high-and-inside to Clinton during the campaign season ? The problem is there 's nothing even remotely similar happening to Republican candidates on the Times ' opinion pages via its columnists . That level of oddly-personal vitriol targeted at Clinton , and certainly the sheer repetition of the vitriol , simply does n't exist when Times columnists ponder GOP performances and even belittle them .\nFor instance , when Ross Douthat ridiculed Mitt Romney in January for contemplating a third presidential run , the columnist belittled Romney 's \u201c conspicuous \u201d campaign performance from 2012 . He did n't write an armchair psychology essay about what a flawed and entitled person he thought Romney was , or try to extrapolate all kinds of dark , ulterior motives from Romney 's campaign pronouncements . There were no claims that Romney 's possible run was rooted in an endless grab for power and fame . That kind of nonsense seems reserved exclusively for Clinton .\nHere is a small sample of what readers of Times columns have learned about Hillary Clinton this year : She gives off an `` atmosphere of hostility , '' `` exploit [ s ] our better angels and our desire , '' is guilty of `` shakedowns , '' remains `` suffused with paranoia and pre-emptive defensiveness , '' and boasts `` self-destructive instincts . ''\nTimes columnists have noted Clinton recently wore a `` forced smile , which was practically cemented in place , '' she seems `` like an annoyed queen , radiating irritation at anyone who tries to hold you accountable , '' and she `` does n't sparkle with honesty and openness . '' Clinton , a flip-flopping `` shapeshifter , '' has been around so long the electorate `` has known her since the Mesozoic era , '' \u201c she looked as if she was getting sucked into the past , \u201d and to she wants become `` grandmother of our country . ''\nWorse , Clinton 's surrounded by the `` usual hatchets , '' is known for her `` lordly appetites and her queenly prerogatives , '' `` can not emulate the wholesale allure of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama , '' and there 's a `` paranoid/legalese perspective that permeates '' her .\nMore ? Clinton 's `` still idling on the runway , but we 're already jet-lagged . '' She 's too often `` hunkered down , steely , scornful and secretive . '' She has a `` reputation for flouting rules and operating in secrecy '' and may have `` a political death wish . ''\nAnd oh yeah , `` she ca n't figure out how to campaign as a woman . '' That from Dowd , who has spent her career at the Times personally attacking Clinton .\nThere have been moments of praise -- notes that Clinton could present \u201c serious change , \u201d has \u201c unquestioned smarts , \u201d and has made \u201c remarkable and audacious \u201d moves . But the vitriol is drowning out the glimmers of support .\nThe Times ' institutional antagonism towards the Clintons goes back decades . During Bill Clinton 's first term , Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. once told Clinton that paper had adopted a \u201c tough love \u201d policy towards his presidency . \u201c I 've seen the tough , \u201d Clinton quipped . \u201c Where 's the love ? \u201d\nAs she reads Times columnists , Hillary might be asking the same thing .",
