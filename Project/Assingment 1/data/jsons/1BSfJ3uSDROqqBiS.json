    "content": "The Supreme Court announced on Monday that it will hear California v. Texas and United States House of Representatives v. Texas , two consolidated cases that represent an existential threat to Obamacare , and that were brought by a coalition of Republican-governed states . For the third time since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 , the justices will hear a lawsuit seeking to eviscerate the legislation .\nTexas turns on Congress \u2019 s decision to repeal Obamacare \u2019 s individual mandate . As originally enacted , the Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to either obtain health insurance or pay higher taxes . The tax law President Donald Trump signed in 2017 reduces the amount of that tax to zero .\nBecause the Supreme Court upheld the fully functional mandate as a valid exercise of Congress \u2019 s power to tax in 2012 , the Texas plaintiffs argue that the zeroed-out version of the mandate is unconstitutional \u2014 how can something be a tax if it raises no money whatsoever ? They also claim that the entire Affordable Care Act must fall if the deactivated mandate is unconstitutional .\nThe Republican legal arguments against Obamacare in this case are widely viewed as ridiculous , even by many lawyers and scholars who spent much of the last decade trying to convince the courts to repeal President Obama \u2019 s signature achievement .\nJonathan Adler , a conservative law professor \u2014 and a leading evangelist for an earlier lawsuit seeking to undercut the Affordable Care Act by reading a poorly drafted provision of the law to cut off much of the act \u2019 s funding \u2014 labeled many of the red states \u2019 arguments \u201c implausible , \u201d \u201c hard to justify , \u201d and \u201c surprisingly weak. \u201d The Wall Street Journal \u2019 s editorial board labeled this lawsuit the \u201c Texas Obamacare Blunder. \u201d Yuval Levin , a prominent conservative policy wonk , wrote in the National Review that the Texas lawsuit \u201c doesn \u2019 t even merit being called silly . It \u2019 s ridiculous . \u201d\nAnd yet , the lawsuit has received very favorable treatment from Republican federal judges . Judge Reed O \u2019 Connor , a former Republican Senate staffer turned district judge , ordered the whole Affordable Care Act repealed in its entirety . Two Republican federal appeals court judges reached a somewhat more mild conclusion \u2014 striking down a small portion of the law and then sending the case back down to O \u2019 Connor to reconsider which other provisions should fall . But , while that holding creates more work for Judge O \u2019 Connor , he remains likely to kill as much of the law as he can .\nIn addition to weighing the merits of the plaintiffs \u2019 arguments , the Supreme Court will need to consider whether any federal court has jurisdiction to hear this case . As a general rule , no one is allowed to challenge a law in federal court unless they can show they were injured by that law . Because the zeroed-out mandate does nothing , it \u2019 s highly doubtful that anyone is allowed to challenge it .\nAssuming that President Trump does not get to replace any of the current justices , the Supreme Court is unlikely to agree with the lower-court judges who ruled against Obamacare . Chief Justice John Roberts twice broke with his conservative colleagues in lawsuits attacking Obamacare , and Roberts is especially likely to reject the Texas plaintiffs \u2019 legal arguments . But , so long as this lawsuit exists , it remains a threat to Obamacare . And there is no guarantee that the court \u2019 s membership will not change .\nAs noted above , the Affordable Care Act originally required most Americans to either carry insurance or pay higher taxes . The Supreme Court famously upheld this provision , known as the \u201c individual mandate , \u201d as a valid exercise of Congress \u2019 power to levy taxes in NFIB v. Sebelius ( 2012 ) .\nCongressional Republicans spent much of 2017 debating various plans to repeal Obamacare , but they ultimately did not have the votes for a broad repeal . They did , however , manage to repeal the individual mandate in the 2017 tax legislation . Though the United States Code still contains Obamacare \u2019 s language requiring individuals to pay a tax penalty if they do not have insurance , the amount of that penalty is now zero dollars .\nThe Texas plaintiffs claim that this shell of a mandate is unconstitutional . The fully functional mandate was constitutional because it is a tax , but a zero dollar tax is no tax at all . So the Texas plaintiffs argue that it must be unconstitutional .\nThat \u2019 s not a frivolous argument , but so what ? The zeroed mandate already does nothing . So who cares if a provision of the law that literally does nothing at all is constitutional or not ?\nTo achieve anything meaningful , the Texas plaintiffs don \u2019 t just need to convince the courts that a nothingburger mandate is unconstitutional . They also have to get a majority of the justices to embrace two other arguments : the claim that the Texas plaintiffs may challenge a legal provision that does nothing and the claim that the entire Affordable Care Act must fall . That , as Levin wrote , is utterly ridiculous .\nBy conventional standards , no federal court should be allowed to hear this case\nBefore anyone is allowed to challenge a law in federal court , they must show that they \u2019 ve been injured in some way by that law \u2014 a requirement known as \u201c standing. \u201d That alone should be enough to doom the Texas litigation . Because the plaintiffs challenge a provision that does nothing at all , no one is injured by it . So no one has standing .\nThe plaintiffs argue they can get around this problem by pointing to the way Obamacare \u2019 s language laying out the individual mandate is structured . The first subsection of that language says that most individuals \u201c shall \u201d carry health insurance ; the second says that people who don \u2019 t buy insurance pay a tax penalty ; the third sets the amount of that penalty \u2014 which , again , is now zero dollars .\nAlthough the penalty for not buying insurance is nothing , the plaintiffs claim that individuals are still bound by the language saying that they \u201c shall \u201d carry insurance \u2014 and therefore are injured by a law that commands them to do something they don \u2019 t want to do .\nThe biggest problem with this argument is that it runs counter to the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision in NFIB , the decision upholding the fully functional individual mandate . As Chief Justice Roberts explained :\nNeither the Act nor any other law attaches negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance , beyond requiring a payment to the IRS . The Government agrees with that reading , confirming that if someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insurance , they have fully complied with the law .\nThus , the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the Texas plaintiffs \u2019 argument that they are bound by a command to buy insurance . There are no \u201c negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance \u201d except having to pay a tax penalty . Anyone who pays that penalty has \u201c fully complied with the law. \u201d And the amount of that penalty , in case this isn \u2019 t already clear , is now zero dollars .\nBut let \u2019 s assume , for a moment , that these plaintiffs have the standing to challenge a law that does nothing . Let \u2019 s also assume that the ex-mandate is unconstitutional . What then ?\nWhen a court strikes down one provision of a broader statute , it often must ask whether other provisions of the statute must fall along with it . This inquiry is called \u201c severability , \u201d and it \u2019 s typically a speculative inquiry . Courts ask which hypothetical law Congress would have enacted if it had known that a particular provision was invalid .\nThere \u2019 s no need to speculate in Texas , however , because Congress already answered this question . Lawmakers spent most of 2017 debating how much of the Affordable Care Act to repeal . Ultimately , they only had the votes to repeal one provision , the individual mandate , while leaving the rest of the law intact . So we know that Congress would have enacted a law that eliminated the individual mandate and kept the rest of the law because Congress enacted a law that eliminated the individual mandate and kept the rest of the law .\nThis conclusion is bolstered by the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision in Murphy v. NCAA ( 2018 ) , which held that courts should apply a very strong presumption against striking additional provisions of a law when one provision is declared unconstitutional . \u201c In order for other ... provisions to fall , \u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the Court in Murphy , \u201c it must be \u2018 evident that [ Congress ] would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power , independently of [ those ] which [ are ] not . \u2019 \u201d\nThe question facing the Supreme Court now , in other words , is whether the Court will apply its ordinary standing rules as well as the rule it announced in Murphy , in a politically charged case involving a law that Republicans hate above all others . Roberts has twice signaled that he is not willing to embrace dubious legal claims in order to undercut Obamacare , so the Texas plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail .\nBut if Trump gets to fill another Supreme Court seat , all bets are off .",
