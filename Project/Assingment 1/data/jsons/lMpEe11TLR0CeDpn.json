Perhaps no group needed less convincing of this proposition than white evangelical Christians , who have long felt embattled . \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d was the perfect slogan for Americans who had already embraced the notion that the country \u2019 s culture and way of life had been deteriorating since the 1950s . Indeed , white evangelical Christians voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton in large numbers , and Trump has maintained their support to an impressive degree .\nBut there are increasing signs of a generational rift : Younger white evangelicals have not fully bought into Trump \u2019 s politics and are less receptive to Trump \u2019 s message of cultural decline . The age gap among white evangelicals in some ways just mirrors the age gap among the public overall with regards to Trump , but in conversations with a number of younger white evangelical Christians , many said they are reexamining the way their faith informs their politics and whether the two have become too tightly intertwined .\nIf you drill to the center of Trump \u2019 s political base , a big chunk of those voters are white evangelical Christians . Evangelical leaders are among the first to defend him from criticism and the most ready to forgive his personal behavior . Roughly seven in 10 white evangelical Christians approve of the job Trump is doing as president , and many have been delighted by Trump \u2019 s first term .\nYounger white evangelical Christians , however , express far less enthusiasm for Trump , even if they haven \u2019 t completely abandoned him . According to the 2019 Voter Study Group survey , only six in 10 younger white evangelical Christians ( between the ages of 18 and 44 ) view Trump favorably , whereas 80 percent of those age 45 or older have a favorable opinion of the president . The intensity gap is even more pronounced . Only one-quarter ( 25 percent ) of younger white evangelical Christians report having a \u201c very favorable \u201d opinion of Trump , compared to a majority ( 55 percent ) of older white evangelicals .\nNo issue exemplifies Trump \u2019 s influence among white evangelical Christians \u2014 and highlights the emerging generational divide \u2014 more than immigration . From the start , Trump has made opposition to immigration a central part of his political identity . And white evangelical Christians rallied around Trump in the 2016 election and were quick to embrace his hard-line immigration agenda . During the campaign , white evangelical Christians expressed support for preventing Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. and temporarily banning Muslims from coming to the country . After the election , they coaleseced in support of building a wall along the southern border and blocking immigration from majority Muslim countries .\nIndeed , Trump has managed to push the issue of immigration to the center of the evangelical agenda . Seventy-two percent of white evangelical Christians believe immigration should be a top priority , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . Five years ago , in 2014 , that number was 49 percent .\nBut , again , the broad policy support masks a growing generational divide in views on immigrants . Two-thirds ( 66 percent ) of young white evangelical Christians ( age 18 to 34 ) say that immigrants coming to the U.S. strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents , a view shared by only 32 percent of white evangelical seniors ( age 65+ ) . A majority ( 54 percent ) of older white evangelical Christians believe that immigrants are a burden on American society .\nSo why has Trump found younger white evangelicals harder to win over ? Age has a lot to do with it . The president is profoundly unpopular among all young adults . A 2019 Harvard Institute of Politics survey finds that 70 percent of young adults ( age 18 to 24 ) disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president .\nBut immigration in particular points to another reason young white evangelicals have been less receptive to Trump : Their lives have been dramatically different than their parents \u2019 .\nMost white evangelical Christians say that the U.S. becoming a majority nonwhite country is a negative development . However , the younger white evangelical Christians I spoke to said the immigration debate is complicated . \u201c Immigration is not as black-and-white as abortion , \u201d said Lauren Burns , an evangelical student enrolled at Biola University .\nFirst , the young evangelicals told me that demographic change doesn \u2019 t register as a \u201c threat \u201d to them . Like young Americans more generally , racial , ethnic and religious diversity is a normal part of their everyday life . In the U.S. , only half of all evangelical Christians under 30 are white according to a 2016 study . On Christian college campuses , which have seen enrollment gains in recent years , young white evangelical Christians are part of an increasingly diverse student body . White students account for 62 percent of the student body on the roughly 140 campuses affiliated with the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities , down from 82 percent in 1999 .\nAnd there are other reasons to think younger evangelicals would be less receptive to a message of America in decline . Anecdotally , at least , it seems young white evangelical Christians are less apt to believe their faith is in imminent danger from the broader culture .\nIn a recent interview with Newsweek , Russell Moore , president of the Southern Baptist Convention \u2019 s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission , argued that the \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d slogan never really resonated with younger white evangelicals . \u201c Young evangelicals do not feel as if they are losing anything in terms of American culture , \u201d he wrote . \u201c They came of age at a time when following Christ seemed countercultural to them anyway . They never expected a nominally Christian culture in which being a church member would be the equivalent of being a good American . \u201d\nIndeed , young adults are upending many of the religious conventions and cultural assumptions that defined American public life in the past . Young people don \u2019 t feel particularly negatively toward atheists , nor do they view Islam as incompatible with American values . They don \u2019 t feel especially confident in religious leaders and they don \u2019 t see religious commitment as synonymous with virtue . The 2018 General Social Survey found that the majority of young adults say that people with strong religious beliefs are often intolerant of others . Even back in 2015 , the overwhelming majority of young adults said they do not believe America is a Christian nation \u2014 one in five said it never was \u2014 and being Christian is not an important part of being American . The Christian consensus of previous generations , such as there was , is gone .\nBut critically , for young white evangelical Christians , this is the way it has always been . Numerically , they are already in the minority . Only 8 percent of adults under 30 are white evangelical Protestants . The segment of that age group that \u2019 s unaffiliated with any religion is nearly five times as large . Among Americans age 65 and older , white evangelicals account for more than one quarter of the population . Not surprisingly , young adults today are actually more likely to say they know an atheist than an evangelical . Growing up in Portland , Oregon , Burns \u2019 s group of friends in high school included people of color , gay and lesbian people , and atheists . \u201c If I limited myself to only conservative white Christians , it would be pretty lonely , \u201d she said .\nRather than yearning for the past , many young white evangelical Christians I spoke with have learned to navigate between an increasingly secular culture and their own deeply held religious commitments . Perhaps nothing defines the experience of young white evangelical Christians more than the conflict between their peers and their faith . Aaryn Marsters , who at the time of the interview was a 33-year-old evangelical Christian living in Charlotte , North Carolina , described the experience to The New York Times : \u201c As evangelical young people become more liberal , older evangelicals think we \u2019 ve been brainwashed by the world . And as we continue to hold onto our faith and some more conservative or traditional values , many non-Christians believe we are still brainwashed from our upbringing . \u201d\nFor many older white evangelical Christians , Trump \u2019 s vigorous public defense of conservative Christians remains the most compelling reason to support his reelection . At the Road to Majority Conference , an evangelical grassroots summit , for example , Faith and Freedom Coalition chairman Ralph Reed affirmed evangelicals \u2019 unwavering commitment to President Trump . \u201c There has never been anyone who has defended us and fought for us , who we have loved more than Donald J. Trump. \u201d Jerry Fallwell Jr. , head of Liberty University and a staunch Trump supporter , recently suggested that Christians needed to stop electing \u201c nice guys \u201d in favor of \u201c street fighters \u201d like Trump . Facing what they see as an increasingly hostile cultural climate , many older white evangelical Christians view Trump as their last and only option .\nBut this sentiment makes many younger evangelical Christians profoundly uncomfortable and strikes them as practically unnecessary . Aryana Petrosky , an evangelical and recent graduate from a nondenominational Christian school in California , worries about Christians aligning themselves with those in power . She also challenges the notion that conservative Christians need politicians to defend their beliefs in the public square . \u201c We shouldn \u2019 t be looking to political leaders to defend our faith , \u201d she said . It \u2019 s a view that is entirely consistent with the way younger white evangelicals understand politics . A 2017 Voter Study Group survey found that while nearly three-quarters of older white evangelical Christians agree that \u201c politics is ultimately a struggle between good and evil , \u201d younger white evangelicals are far more evenly divided on this issue .\nSo what about 2020 ? Few young white evangelical Christians who I \u2019 ve spoken with express enthusiasm about the coming election . For most , Trump is not their preferred candidate , but an increasingly secular and liberal Democratic Party does not present an attractive alternative . Given evangelicals \u2019 strong pro-life commitment , the Democrats \u2019 vocal support for abortion access makes the possibility of defection even less likely .\nAt this stage , a couple of predictions are easy . White evangelical Christians will strongly back Trump \u2019 s reelection bid , following a decades-old pattern , while young adults will rally to the Democratic nominee , as they have done in every presidential election since 2004 . In a two-way contest , Trump is still likely to make off with the majority of young white evangelical votes . A tepid vote counts just as much as an enthusiastic one . Yet Trump is redefining the relationship young evangelical Christians have with the Republican Party . The long-term implications for our politics and evangelical Christianity could be profound .\nKate Stewart was raised in a very civically minded family and had been excited about the prospect of voting in the 2016 election long before her 18th birthday . But she became dismayed and disillusioned by her options . \u201c Having to choose between these lesser of two evils was really disheartening , \u201d she said . Looking ahead to 2020 , Stewart for the first time in her voting life has started to look at candidates outside the Republican Party . \u201c I \u2019 m cautiously optimistic that the evangelical vote , or at least my evangelical vote , might find a home outside the party of Donald Trump . \u201d",
