    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s facing a wall within his party , with Republicans who don \u2019 t currently support him far more apt to prefer Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio in a two-way race -- or even to favor a contested convention to block Trump \u2019 s nomination .\nTrump continues to lead in a new \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll , with 34 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents who are registered to vote saying they \u2019 d like to see him win the nomination . But he trails both Cruz and Rubio one-on-one . And preferences for Cruz , Rubio and John Kasich have grown as others have left the race , while Trump \u2019 s support has essentially remained unchanged for months .\nIn the current multi-candidate race , 25 percent say they \u2019 d like to see Cruz win the nomination , with 18 percent for Rubio and 13 percent for Kasich ; those are +4 , +7 and +11 points compared with January , respectively , to new highs for each . Trump , by contrast , peaked at 38 percent in December . ( In a difference from previous matchups , this poll asked respondents whom they \u2019 d like to see win , rather than whom they \u2019 d vote for , since the primaries are underway . )\nIn hypothetical two-way matchups , Cruz leads Trump by 54-41 percent and Rubio leads Trump by 51-45 percent in this poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates . While the latter lead isn \u2019 t statistically significant , both are further signs of the apparent limits to Trump \u2019 s popularity within his party . Indeed , among non-Trump supporters , seven in 10 say they \u2019 d prefer Cruz , and as many say they \u2019 d pick Rubio , in head-to-head contests .\nTwo key groups help Cruz outperform Rubio mano-a-mano against Trump : strong conservatives and evangelical white Protestants . Cruz leads Trump by 60-34 percent among very conservative registered leaned Republicans and by 64-31 percent among evangelical white Protestants . Rubio \u2019 s margins vs. Trump in those groups are a closer 56-41 percent and 55-42 percent , respectively .\nBoth Cruz and Rubio run up the score among those who value experience over being an outsider and who oppose Trump \u2019 s signature issues , deporting undocumented immigrants and banning Muslims from entering the country . They also benefit from vast margins among women , more than six in 10 of whom choose either Rubio or Cruz over Trump . Trump wins a smaller majority of men .\nThe national survey , conducted March 3-6 , also finds less drama but still a closer-than-previous race on the Democratic side , where Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents who are registered to vote say by 49-42 percent that they \u2019 d like to see Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders -- the closest it \u2019 s been in any ABC/Post poll this cycle , dramatically tighter than the peak 68-16 percent Clinton advantage in vote preferences in July .\nIt \u2019 s the first time preference for Clinton has slipped below half of registered leaned Democrats in ABC/Post polls , as well as the first time Sanders has held a lead among men . Still , Clinton \u2019 s 12-point advantage among mainline Democrats is keeping her boat afloat .\nThere are more trouble signs for Trump in the Republican race : A tepid 52 percent of leaned Republicans see him favorably overall . Just 51 percent say they \u2019 d be satisfied with him as the nominee . And those who don \u2019 t currently support Trump say by a broad 63-30 percent that if he lacks the majority it takes to win on the first ballot -- even if he has the most delegates -- they \u2019 d rather have the convention pick someone else .\nTrump , as noted in the two-way results , has a particular problem with GOP women . His support from women is 20 points lower than from men , 24 vs. 44 percent . ( The gender gap has fluctuated ; it was similar in December , disappeared in January , and now is back in a big way . ) Moreover , 60 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning women say they \u2019 d be dissatisfied with Trump as the nominee , including 45 percent \u201c very \u201d dissatisfied . Comparable numbers among GOP men are far lower \u2013- 35 percent would be dissatisfied with Trump , 20 percent very much so .\nOther results also mark Trump \u2019 s challenges as a front-runner under siege . He trails Cruz and Rubio alike in all four personal attributes tested in this survey . Fewer than half of leaned Republicans -\u2013 from 42 to 45 percent \u2013- call Trump honest and trustworthy , say he understands their problems , think he has the right personality and temperament , or say he has the right experience to be president . Comparable numbers are 63 or 64 percent on each attribute for Cruz and 61 to 63 percent for Rubio on the first three items . He slips to 50 percent on experience .\nSome of these have worsened for Trump : a 12-point drop among leaned Republicans since September in seeing him as honest and trustworthy and an 8-point drop in thinking he has the kind of personality and temperament it takes to serve effectively as president .\nTrump , again , is especially weak on personal attributes among GOP women -\u2013 off by 15 to 20 points compared with men . And just 41 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning women see him favorably overall , vs. 62 percent of men . Indeed , 40 percent of these women see Trump \u201c strongly \u201d unfavorably , compared with 24 percent of GOP men .\nAdditionally , just among mainline Republicans , \u201c strongly \u201d unfavorable views of Trump overall are up by 12 points since November . His overall favorability rating in the party is down by 17 points from a high of 69 percent in November , led by a 30-point drop among strong conservatives , from 82 percent favorable in November to 52 percent now .\nEven with substantial support for a contested convention among leaned Republicans who don \u2019 t support Trump , efforts by party elders to block him get a mixed reception . Among those who \u2019 d be less than very satisfied with Trump as the nominee , 43 percent support efforts by some GOP leaders to prevent his nomination ; 51 percent are opposed . That said , support for a contested convention is an eye-opening result , clearly indicating the depths of divisions within the party .\nThe Democratic race resembles the GOP contest in one respect : a large gender gap . Clinton leads Sanders in preference to win the nomination by 55-34 percent among women , while it \u2019 s Sanders over Clinton by 53-41 percent among men . Sanders has gained 16 points among men since January , and Clinton \u2019 s lost 12 ; it \u2019 s the first time in ABC/Post polls that he \u2019 s led among men .\nAmong other groups , Sanders continues to draw strongly from younger adults , Clinton \u2019 s lost 13 points since January among liberals , and -- as in primaries to date \u2013- the two are essentially even among whites , while Clinton leads by a substantial margin among nonwhites .\nThat said , while the two run evenly among Democratic-leaning independents , Clinton holds a 12-point advantage among mainline Democrats , 51-39 percent , a key reason she \u2019 s prevailed in most primaries to date .\nClinton is rated particularly well for her personality and temperament and experience , with more than eight in 10 leaned Democrats rating these positively ; 72 percent also say she understands their problems . Fewer , 58 percent , see Clinton as honest and trustworthy , but that \u2019 s better than Trump within his party , and close ( 5 points shy ) to Cruz and Rubio \u2019 s in-party ratings .\nFurthermore , either Democratic candidate is broadly acceptable within their party : 74 percent of leaned Democrats say they \u2019 d be satisfied with Clinton as the nominee , and 72 percent would be satisfied with Sanders . That compares with satisfaction figures on the Republican side of 51 percent for Trump , 56 percent for Kasich , 62 percent Rubio and 65 percent for Cruz .\nOther results help flesh out these findings . Among them -- focused on the GOP race :\n\u2022 Americans by 63-33 percent oppose temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country -- a cornerstone Trump proposal -- but that flips to 52-43 percent support among leaned Republicans . Preference for Trump is twice as high among supporters of this idea as compared with its critics .\n\u2022 Similarly , the public by 61-36 percent opposes deporting undocumented immigrants , but this goes to 55-41 percent support among leaned Republicans , an even stronger source of Trump \u2019 s support . He wins 46 percent of deportation supporters , vs. 18 percent of opponents .\n\u2022 There \u2019 s also some racial tension behind Trump \u2019 s numbers -- he does notably well among leaned Republicans who feel that whites are \u201c losing out \u201d because of preferences for blacks and Hispanics , with 43 percent support in this group vs. 25 percent among those who feel otherwise . In a statistical analysis , this view is one of the strongest independent predictors of preference for Trump vs. his GOP competitors , along with ideology , gender , support for deportation , and support for banning Muslims .\n\u2022 Fifty-five percent of leaned Republicans are looking for a political outsider -- again a boost for Trump . Among leaned Democrats , 82 percent instead put a priority on a candidate with political experience .\n\u2022 Anger at the government is down , to 21 percent -- 11 points lower than in October 2013 , when economic discontent was much higher , and its lowest since October 2010 . Trump does best with angry voters ; economic gains therefore may work against him .\n\u2022 Americans by 69-29 percent see the current political system as \u201c dysfunctional \u201d -- similar to what we \u2019 ve seen previously , and a sense that peaks among leaned Republicans . As with anger , this is another strong factor in support for Trump : Among leaned Republicans who feel strongly that the current system is dysfunctional , Trump has 40 percent support ; among all others , 23 percent .\nThis \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone March 3-6 , 2016 , in English and Spanish , among a random national sample of 1,000 adults . Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points , including the design effect , for the full sample ; 5.5 points for registered leaned Republicans ; and 6.0 points for registered leaned Democrats . Partisan divisions are 34-25-32 percent , Democrats-Republicans-Independents .\nThe survey was produced for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Langer Research Associates of New York , N.Y. , with sampling , data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York , New York .
