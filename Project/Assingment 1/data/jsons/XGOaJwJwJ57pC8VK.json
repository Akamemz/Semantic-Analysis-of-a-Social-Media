The second is President Obama \u2019 s continued campaign to secure Congressional approval for his flawed nuclear deal with Iran .

He has virtually guaranteed Iran becomes a regional power with the ability to build long-range missiles capable of hitting the U.S. homeland . And on top of all this , he wants to hand Iran $ 100 billion in sanctions relief , which will be used in part to fund Hamas and Hezbollah , promote instability in Bahrain and Yemen , and prop up Bashar al-Assad in Syria .\nThe negotiations with Cuba have proven equally one-sided . President Obama has rewarded the Castro regime for its repressive tactics and persistent , patient opposition to American interests . He has unilaterally given up on a half-century worth of policy toward the Castro regime that was agreed upon by presidents of both parties .

First , I will quickly reimpose sanctions on Iran . I will give the mullahs a choice : either you have an economy or you have a nuclear program , but you can not have both . I will also ask Congress to pass crushing new measures that target human rights abuses and the sponsorship of terrorism .

First , on day one , I will give the Castros a choice : either continue repressing your people and lose the diplomatic relations provided by President Obama , or carry out meaningful political and human rights reforms and receive increased U.S. trade , investment , and support . Second , I will restore Cuba to the state sponsor of terror list until it stops supporting designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations , helping North Korea evade international sanctions , or harboring fugitives from American justice .
