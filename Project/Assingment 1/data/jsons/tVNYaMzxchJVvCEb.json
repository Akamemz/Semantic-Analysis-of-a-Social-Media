    "content": "San Francisco 's Board of Supervisors has voted unanimously to ban single-use plastic straws , making it the second major American city to do so .\nThe ordinance outlaws not just plastic straws , but also plastic splash sticks , toothpicks , and cocktail sticks , which would have to include those little swords and umbrellas . Other straw bans typically target food service businesses , but this one will prohibit anyone , including grocery stores and other retailers , from selling plastic straws .\n`` The negative environmental impacts of single-use plastics are astronomical , '' bill sponsor Katy Tang said in a statement . `` San Francisco has been a pioneer of environmental change , and it 's time for us to find alternatives to the plastic that is choking our marine ecosystems and littering our streets . ''\nLike all good straw bans , the text of Tang 's bill mentions the questionable statistic that Americans use 500 million straws a day . This statistic comes from a unconfirmed 2011 phone survey of straw manufacturers conducted by a 9-year-old . Market analysts think the actual number is far lower .\nViolators of San Francisco 's plastic straw/sword ban will face between $ 100 and $ 500 in fines , depending on the number of violations . While an explicit exemption for disabled people\u2014many of whom lack the motor skills to drink or eat without a straw\u2014is not included , the bill does say that `` strict compliance '' with the law is not required when it would `` interfere with accommodating for any person 's medical needs . ''\nThis makes it less punitive than the straw ban in nearby Santa Barbara , which has no disability exemption and even allows for the possibility of criminal sanctions . In other ways , though , San Francisco 's straw ban is quite restrictive . Unlike Seattle 's straw ban , for example , San Francisco 's does not allow straws made from most compostable bioplastics .\nThe bill also includes a ton of other non-straw-related regulations aimed at cutting down on single-use food containers . Starting in 2020 , event planners will now have to make reusable cups available for 10 percent of attendees . That same year , businesses will be required to meet yet-to-be-determined targets for using recycled content in containers , cups , and other `` food service ware . ''\nTang 's bill also restricts city departments ' ability to issue waivers or exemptions for those claiming financial hardship .\nA final vote enacting this ordinance into law is not expected until next week . But given the board 's unanimous sign-off , this is a mere formality . The straw ban will take effect in July 2020 .\nAs I 've written many times in the past , straw bans are a useless environmental measure . San Francisco 's is no exception . The United States is responsible for less than one percent of the world 's plastic marine waste , and straws make up a tinier portion of this still . The best way to cut back on plastic pollution in the oceans is to improve waste management systems in China and other parts of the developing world , not to tinker with individuals ' consumption habits in the States .\nDespite the medical exemption , many disabled people will no doubt find it harder to have a drink out on the town . Able-bodied consumers will be inconvenienced too , although to a lesser degree .
