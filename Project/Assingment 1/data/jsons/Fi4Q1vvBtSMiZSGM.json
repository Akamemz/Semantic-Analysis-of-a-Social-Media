    "content": "Whenever we libertarians point out democracy 's perverse incentives ( as I do here ) we risk being accused of elitism . However , those who assume that the only alternative to rule by the people is rule by an aristocracy reveal a tragically incomplete awareness of the choices before us .\nRather than choose among rulers , we should ask why anyone at all must rule . But even if we do n't go quite that far , we could entertain the idea that radically reducing the scale and scope of government , which essentially is the threat of violence , would also drastically reduce the harm produced by those perverse incentives . Elitism is n't the only available alternative to democracy\u2014and it certainly is not the most desirable one .\nUnfortunately , some libertarian critiques of democracy encourage nonlibertarians to believe some form of elitism is the only alternative . Take Georgetown University professor Jason Brennan 's recent op-ed , `` Can epistocracy , or knowledge-based voting , fix democracy ? '' in the Los Angeles Times , which is drawn from his book Against Democracy . Brennan begins by citing democracy 's systemic flaw : `` The median voter wields great power over what politicians ultimately do . But\u2014and here 's the problem\u2014the median voter would fail economics or Political Science 101 . ''\n`` For 60 years , political scientists have studied what voters actually know , '' Brennan continues .\nThe results are depressing . Hundreds of different surveys , such as the American National Election Studies , find that the median voter is ignorant or misinformed not only about the social sciences needed to evaluate candidates ' policy proposals , but even of basic facts and trends , such as what the unemployment rate is and whether it 's going up or down . This is n't because public schools fail us . It 's not because Fox News or MSNBC ( take your pick ) bamboozles poor voters with well-crafted lies . It 's not because people are inherently stupid or unable to think for themselves . It 's because democracy gives us the wrong incentives . How we vote matters , but how any one of us votes does not . The chance an individual vote will make a difference is vanishingly small . Thus , we have little incentive to gather relevant information so that we can cast our votes in careful , thoughtful ways\u2026 . While not everything governments do is decided by voters \u2014 bureaucracies , parties and officials have significant independence \u2014 what voters want makes a difference . And since voters are generally uninformed , we get worse policies that we would with a better-informed electorate .\nI 'll leave for another time Brennan 's debatable contention that this `` better-informed electorate '' is really better informed where it counts . ( When this electorate says it favors `` free trade , '' does it actually mean neoliberal managed trade through government agreements , which may be what some of the supposedly lesser informed electorate fears ? ) Instead , I 'll focus on Brennan 's `` alternative to democracy called epistocracy . '' He explains : `` In a democracy , every citizen gets an equal right to vote . In an epistocracy , voting power is widespread , but votes are weighted : More knowledgeable citizens ' votes count more . ''\nBrennan lays out several ways to implement epistocracy , insisting that `` epistocracies should keep some things\u2014like our basic rights\u2014off the bargaining table . They should make power widespread because concentrating power among the few invites abuse . Epistocracies should have constitutional limits on power , judicial review , checks and balances and a bill of rights\u2014just like representative democracies . '' That 's a relief , but can we really trust the informed elite to understand basic rights ? ( Did the framers of the Constitution get it right ? I argue otherwise in America 's Counter-Revolution : The Constitution Revisited . )\nEven with his caveat , Brennan 's proposal leaves him open to the charge of elitism . Rod Dreher of The American Conservative writes :\nRestricting the vote to the cognitive elite is no solution . I would rather be ruled by the first thousand people through the gates at the Daytona 500 than the people in that room Friday night with Hillary Clinton and Barbra Streisand . Guess who holds more power already in our society ? That 's right : the cognitive elite . That 's how it works in a meritocracy . Prof. Brennan 's epistocracy would only give them more \u2014 for our own good .\nBrennan certainly does not blunt the elitism charge when he writes :\nSome would object that epistocracy is essentially inegalitarian . In an epistocracy , not everyone has the same voting power . But what 's so wrong with that ? Only some people have plumbing or hairdressing licenses because we accept that only some people are qualified to fix pipes or cut hair . Perhaps only some people , rather than everyone 18 and over , are truly qualified to decide who will lead the most powerful country on earth .\nNeed I point out that it is astonishing for a libertarian to cite licensing in defense of his plan for an unequal distribution of voting power ? Formally , licensing is the state 's way of determining who may and may not engage in occupations supposedly in the interest of consumers . Actually , licensing is how incumbent practitioners of occupations exclude competition and hamper innovation in order to support the monopolistic incomes to which they have become accustomed . It 's a system of privilege . Why hitch political reform to it ?\nThe public-choice problems with any form of epistocracy have long been noted , and Brennan is familiar with them . For example , who would compose the test to determine who gets extra votes ? Even if we assume that Brennan has good ideas about making any test fair , public-choice analysis gives us \u2588\u2588\u2588 to doubt that his ideas would be adopted .\nAnother problem with testing relates to Gilbert Ryle 's distinction between `` knowing how '' and `` knowing that . '' Someone could be ignorant of the facts asked for on a test\u2014what 's the unemployment rate ? what party controls Congress ? Etc.\u2014but have perfectly libertarian instincts about what the government ought not to be able to do to him . Why should that person have fewer votes than , say , Paul Krugman or George Will ?\nThe shame here is the Brennan need n't have gone down this road . He needed only to spell out the flaws in democracy , contrast stupid `` public '' action with reasonably intelligent private action , and call for a substantial shrinking of government\u2014if not its abolition . Why invite the elitist charge with a call for an epistocracy ?\nAlbert Jay Nock had it right in the opening of his classic book , Our Enemy the State :\nIf we look beneath the surface of our public affairs , we can discern one fundamental fact , namely , a great redistribution of power between society and the State . This is the fact that interests the student of civilization . He has only a secondary or derived interest in matters like price fixing , wage fixing , inflation , political banking , 'agricultural adjustment , ' and similar items of State policy that fill the pages of newspapers and the mouths of publicists and politicians . All these can be run up under one head . They have an immediate and temporary importance , and for this \u2588\u2588\u2588 they monopolize public attention , but they all come to the same thing ; which is , an increase of State power and a corresponding decrease of social power . It is unfortunately none too well understood that , just as the State has no money of its own , so it has no power of its own . All the power it has is what society gives it , plus what it confiscates from time to time on one pretext or another ; there is no other source from which State power can be drawn . Therefore every assumption of State power , whether by gift or seizure , leaves society with so much less power . There is never , nor can there be , any strengthening of State power without a corresponding and roughly equivalent depletion of social power .\nSocial power is Nock 's term for the web of peaceful consensual relations\u2014market and otherwise\u2014among free individuals . Thus the people 's best political framework is neither democracy nor epistocracy but original liberalism , or what we today call libertarianism .",
