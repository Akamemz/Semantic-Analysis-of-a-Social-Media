    "content": "To many liberals , the post-WWII period in America was a time of near economic perfection . The government taxed the wealthy over 90 percent and unions became powerful organizations demanding a fair share for workers . It was a period that progressive economist Paul Krugman has always been quick to praise , writing in his 2009 book , `` The Conscience of a Liberal '' :\n`` The political and economic environment of my youth stands revealed as a paradise lost , an exceptional moment in our nation \u2019 s history . ''\nThis period , which can be called the Keynesian era , was indeed a time of great economic growth and increased economic equality . Looking back today , it does seem like an exceptional time to be in the working class . ( As long as you were white , of course . ) It was an age of compromise , between the capitalist class and the working class , and perhaps the most democratic period in our liberal capitalist society . During that epoch , it certainly looked as though a form of socialism was on the horizon , with the middle class growing and forming a previously unimaginable kind of egalitarian society within capitalism .\nBut of course , it was not to be . By the '70s , the economy had seemingly become diseased , with both inflation and stagnation , or what was coined stagflation . At the time , most economists were dumbfounded . In neoclassical theory , inflation and recession were opposites , they did not happen simultaneously . Hence the monetary policy of low interest rates during a recession , and high interest rates during a period of high inflation .\nToday , we can pinpoint certain causes for what happened during the '70s . The most obvious is , of course , the energy crisis , which happened in 1973 , after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries declared an oil embargo on America and other developed nations because of their support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War . This sparked a 400 percent increase in the price of oil , affecting the entire economy .\nAnother important consideration for its failure is the very nature of a Keynesian economy , which promotes low unemployment and higher wages . During the Keynesian period ( 1945-1970s ) , unions had created a strong workforce , which forced capitalists to give in to higher wages , and likely contributing to the high inflation plague . And , of course , Nixon \u2019 s dismantling of the Bretton Woods System , which had fixed the international exchange rate to the dollar , and the dollar to gold , created floating currencies , which did not help currency stability .\nThe stagflation crisis , along with increasing globalization , created an opening for the capitalist class , who embraced the thinking of Milton Friedman . The crisis of Keynesianism created a wave of propaganda , which ultimately resulted in the election of Ronald Reagan . At the same time , the high interest rate policies of Fed chairman Paul Volcker attacked inflation head on , and drove the American economy into a deep recession , while undermining the working class . To top this off , the major tax cuts for the wealthy and the war on unions during the Reagan presidency dismantled what was left of the Keynesian-era middle class .\nBut while all of these policies certainly sped up the destruction of America 's working class , what may have truly sealed its fate was globalization and technological progress . To see how much these phenomena hurt the working class , one only has to look at America 's employment history in manufacturing compared to finance . During the post-WWII period , manufacturing accounted for 50 percent of domestic corporate profits and 30 percent of American employment , while the financial industry accounted for 10 percent of profits , and less than 5 percent of employment . Since then , profits for these industries have reversed ; manufacturing accounted for about 10 percent of profits in the early 2000s , but have since recovered to nearly 20 percent , while the financial industry reached a high of 40 percent before the financial crisis , and is closer to 30 percent today . What is even more telling is the number of jobs each industry produces : Today , manufacturing accounts for less than 10 percent , while finance still hovers around 5 percent . So while the financial industries profits have jumped , its share of employment has hardly grown at all .\nAmerica \u2019 s economy has gone through a deindustrialization period , largely replacing its domestic manufacturing with a financialization . And this has created the enormous inequality we have today . While our economy has grown steadily since the '80s , most of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent , and China has taken over as the largest manufacturer in the world .\nThe Keynesian period was a time of compromise , but within a capitalist system , a compromise can only last for so long . The American middle class has since been hollowed out , while the epoch of neoliberalism created irreversible environmental damage .\nSo , is a return to a Keynesian compromise the answer , as economists like Krugman believe ? After the financial crisis , there was a resurgence of fiscal policies that Keynes promoted to combat the recession -- and there can be no doubt that the stimulus policy that America implemented helped the economy recover faster than the European economy , where rigid austerity has plagued several members of eurozone . It has also been reported that the stimulus policy erased most of the middle-class income loss in the recession . But these stimulus policies did not encourage any sort of compromise between capitalists and workers , and the globalized free market will make it quite impossible to return to the sort of compromise of the post-WWII period .\nThe problems seem to be systemic within capitalism . First of all , unions have been completely gutted by the capitalist class over the past 40 years , thanks to globalization and the aforementioned war on unions . Fifty years ago , one in three workers were union members , and today the number is just one in 10 . This was natural reaction from the capitalist class , and there is little hope that unions will ever regain the strength they once possessed . But even more important , if we look at the era of great Keynesian compromise that many progressives want to emulate , evidence points to it being more of an anomaly than a natural outcome of capitalism .\nIndeed , the strong middle class was most certainly a rarity of capitalism , and today our social structure is simply returning to form . While the middle class was assisted by government policies ( i.e . regulation , progressive taxation , union support ) , a major contributing factor in Americas flourishing middle class was the second World War . As Thomas Piketty \u2019 s book \u201c Capital in the Twenty-first Century \u201d pointed out , the mass destruction of capital around the world created a much more even playing field than before , while also placing the United States at the forefront of the world economy . It was an era that some call the Golden Age of Capitalism ; a time of global rebuilding and worldwide economic growth , supported by the American working class .\nBut today is a very different world . Capitalism has defeated communism and spread worldwide . The globalized economy gives all of the cards to the capitalist class , and there is no reason for them to form another Keynesian type of compromise .\nThe threat of communism was another reason for the capitalist system to become fairer -- to weaken support for radical socialists , and provide the working class a reason to accept capitalism over the alternative . FDR was quite aware of this , as he once wrote in a letter : \u201c No question in my mind that it is time for the country to become fairly radical for at least one generation . History shows us that where this occurs , occasionally , nations are saved from revolutions . \u201d\nThe threat of a socialist overthrow of capitalism was very real during that period , when inequality and desperation were great -- and a Keynesian compromise was necessary to prevent the rise of socialism within America . WWII happened to also provide great opportunity for the rise of a middle class . But that period is now long gone , as is the major ideological challenge of communism .\nAnd if we continue to move in the same direction we have been for 40 years , which neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton seem legitimately opposed to ( think of the TPP ) , and Republicans wholeheartedly support , then our future will indeed become a new global Gilded Age .\nThat is , of course , unless the left becomes fairly ( or fully ) radical , as FDR once suggested . And the rise of Elizabeth Warren perhaps shows that there is enough discontent for a new radical movement to form . The capitalist class does not want a compromise , so why not fight it head on ? It has done the same to the middle class over the past four decades , after all . Match the neoliberal movement with a neo-radical movement -- a call for true democracy , rather than the plutocratic democracy that we currently have .\nRather than fighting for a return to a Keynesian compromise , the left should be considering how to create a new 21st century workers movement . Unfortunately , globalization has strengthened the capitalist class , and workers movements can no longer be purely domestic issues ; they must be international . Breaking up too-big-to-fail banks and fighting for more worker control should not be off-limit goals .
