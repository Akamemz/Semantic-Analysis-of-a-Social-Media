    "content": "These days you ca n't swing a dead kulak without hitting someone who 's really , really into socialism , or at least giving it a longer look . On Real Time with Bill Maher last week , movie star Jim Carrey emphatically said , `` We have to say yes to socialism , to the word and everything\u2026.We have to stop apologizing . ''\nThe current It Girl of American politics , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America . The crew behind the popular Chapo Trap House podcast have a widely discussed book out that purports to be a `` Guide to Revolution '' and `` A Manifesto Against Logic , Facts , and \u2588\u2588\u2588 . '' Corey Robin , a professor at CUNY and author of The Reactionary Mind , explains in The New York Times `` why the pitch from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders resonates in 2018 . '' Politico asked a range of mostly left-leaning activists and analysts , `` What Would a Socialist America Look Like ? '' ( The answer : pretty much unicorns and rainbows , apparently . ) Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont , a self-described democratic socialist who pushes national single-payer health care , more funding for Social Security , and a tax on Amazon , still makes the progressive crowd swoon .\nAnd the endorsement of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who like Sanders is widely considered a likely candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination , is highly sought even after she admitted , `` I believe in markets and the benefits they can produce . '' ( More on that later . )\nAccording to Gallup , 51 percent of people between the ages of 18 to 29 have a positive view of socialism while just 45 percent have a positive view of capitalism . A recent Fox News poll ( Fox ! ) found growing support for the statement , `` Do you think it would be a good thing or a bad thing for the United States to move away from capitalism and more toward socialism ? '' Now 36 percent say it would be a good thing ; seven years ago , only 20 percent did . More worrying , just 51 percent think it would be a bad thing , down from well over 60 percent over the same time period .\nWhat are libertarians to make of all this ? Is this the moment when the curve of history starts bending left , even as ( or maybe because ) actual socialist countries such as North Korea , Cuba , and Venezuela dwindle to zero ? I do n't think so , but it would be foolish for anyone who believes in `` Free Minds and Free Markets '' to write off the current moment as merely a symptom of Trump Derangement Syndrome or just a pre-midterm outpouring of limousine liberalism . The financial crisis , the bank and auto-company bailouts ( which all good libertarians opposed ) , the slower-than-molasses recovery , declines in the labor-force participation rate , non-stop war , and more have helped drive confidence in the old ways of doing things through the floor . People are rightly looking for alternatives , and `` socialism '' is one of them .\nThat said , a good chunk of socialism chic can be chalked up to semantic or definitional vagueness . To the extent that socialism is equated with being kind or fair , it 's easy to see the appeal . This is especially true with younger people , who have no memory of what life was like in the old Warsaw Pact countries . When \u2588\u2588\u2588 polled Millennials back in 2014 , 42 percent said they thought socialism was a better system than capitalism , a finding consistent with many other subsequent polls . But when we asked a follow-up question , it became pretty clear that most respondents did n't define socialism as a system where the government owns or heavily controls the means of production . Asked whether they would prefer a `` government-managed economy '' or a `` free-market economy , '' only 32 percent wanted the first option while 64 percent wanted the latter . When even `` communist '' China is practicing at least a version of capitalism , the horror stories coming out of Venezuela are easy to ignore . Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may rail against the gig economy , but just like Bernie and Warren she uses Uber every chance she gets .\nWe may be arriving at a period Joseph Schumpeter warned about in his 1942 masterpiece , Capitalism , Socialism , and Democracy . Marx believed that capitalism would `` immiserate '' proletarians so badly that workers would finally gain true class consciousness , revolt , and commandeer the means of production . Schumpeter thought that was empirically wrong\u2014 '' the capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within reach of factory girls , '' he wrote\u2014but he was convinced that capitalism would defeat itself by creating a society that took wealth creation and rising living standards for granted . Capitalism would die not because of its failure to deliver the good life but because of its success at mainstreaming general wealth .\nCapitalism , Schumpeter famously argued , was built upon `` the gale of creative destruction\u2026a process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within , incessantly destroying the old one , incessantly creating a new one . '' Such nonstop `` turmoil '' causes all sorts of social , cultural , and economic dislocations , is constantly upending established interests , and wears people out until they vote to straitjacket economic change in the name of social calm . You can hear echoes of that today , and not just from Bernie Sanders and other self-proclaimed socialists . Even Donald Trump spoke for the `` forgotten American '' left behind by `` globalists '' who cared more about the poor in foreign countries than the poor in the upper Midwest . There are good reasons to doubt that we 're living in a particularly volatile global labor market , but the reigning narrative on both the right and the left is that we 're in the thick of a period when whole industries rise and fall on an almost hourly basis . That sort of panic makes socialism , which promises to smooth out , control , and direct things to a greater or smaller degree , attractive . At least someone ( other than Rich Uncle Pennybags ) will be in charge , right ?\nThe Chapo bros are actual textbook socialists bent `` on seizing the billionaires ' money , socializing their wealth , and handing the keys of production over to workers , '' all in the interest of creating a utopian three-hour workday . But most of the new era 's socialists are not so old-school . Bernie Sanders has admitted that he does n't want the government to run everything as much as he wants it to run or regulate more stuff . The details are n't all there , but even his Medicare-for-All pitch does n't involve making all health-care professionals public employees . He 's not really far from Warren , who denies being a socialist and is at pains to say that she really , really likes markets\u2014as long as they are tightly regulated so , in her view , they perform more equitably . As she recently told The Atlantic ,\nWhat excites me about markets ? I was telling you that gains-from-trade argument , but really what excites me about markets is competition . I want to make sure we 've got a set of rules that lets everybody who 's got a good , competitive idea get in the game\u2026.We need to make capitalism work for your family and we need to make democracy work for your family .\nWriting in The New York Times , CUNY 's Corey Robin demotes economics to secondary importance for today 's socialists , arguing :\nThe socialist argument against capitalism is n't that it makes us poor . It 's that it makes us unfree . When my well-being depends upon your whim , when the basic needs of life compel submission to the market and subjugation at work , we live not in freedom but in domination . Socialists want to end that domination : to establish freedom from rule by the boss , from the need to smile for the sake of a sale , from the obligation to sell for the sake of survival . Listen to today 's socialists , and you 'll hear less the language of poverty than of power .\nRobin 's emphasis is also evident in some of the contributors to Politico 's symposium , such as the head of the Democratic Socialists of America , who writes that under socialism `` we will have true freedom , not just survival\u2014the choices available to us now that depend on the whims of the few . '' In significant ways , many recent calls for socialism echo the early issues of the anti-Soviet socialist magazine Dissent , which got started in 1954 . Like National Review , which got going a year later from a right-wing perspective , the founders of Dissent were first and foremost promoting individualism in an age of perceived conformity . The differences between Big Government and Big Business were less important perhaps than maintaining one 's unique identity in a world of mass commerce , mass culture , mass warfare . The editors even invoked the adjective libertarian in their statement of purpose :\nWe shall try to reassert the libertarian values of the socialist ideal , and at the same time , to discuss freely and honestly what in the socialist tradition remains alive and what needs to be discarded or modified\u2026.We share a belief in the dignity of the individual , we share a refusal to countenance one man 's gain at the expense of his brother , and we share an intellectual conviction that man can substantially control his condition if he understands it and wills to .\nThere is some of that , however submerged , in today 's calls for socialism . It 's not a bad ideal , to want individuals to be able to flourish however they see fit . In fact , that corresponds almost perfectly with the ways most libertarians talk and think about social organization . What system is most likely to allow individuals to become whomever they want to become ? In this sense , socialism and capitalism ( to use incredibly oversimplified terms ) are both part of the liberal Enlightenment project that begins with autonomous , equal individuals .\nWhat remain vastly different , of course , are attitudes and understandings of economics and of power differentials . Contemporary socialists will insist that regulating more and more of economic life at all levels will improve outcomes , though from a libertarian perspective , all that does is create the sort of hassle factor that drives barbers , tattoo artists , and gig-economy contractors out of business . Sanders and the rest complain endlessly about the high price of education , health care , and housing without noting that these are sectors either monopolized by or heavily regulated by government . How do computers , cars , and cell phones , not to mention food , clothing , and entertainment keep getting relatively cheaper and better over time ?\nLibertarians rightly point out that market forces have been mostly pushing things in a positive direction , especially for the poorest and least-connected among us . Historian Nancy MacLean can generate a fanciful and error-ridden book arguing that school choice is a diabolical plot designed to resegregate America , but those of us who look seriously at what choice and competition can do for K-12 education have a strong argument that such market-like forces improve outcomes , especially for low-income Americans of color . A smaller , more limited government that ends cronyism in the public and private sectors , replaces traditional welfare with unrestricted cash grants to people in need , ends the drug war and a thousand other petty means of social control , and opens borders to trade and people is a libertarian program that I suspect would interest many people who are looking at socialism as a possible answer to today 's problems .\nI do n't expect to ever change the mind of a committed socialist . But libertarians ca n't expect to engage , much less persuade , anyone flirting with socialism if we simply invoke Stalin , the Great Leap Forward , or even Hugo Chavez every time socialism gets mentioned .",
