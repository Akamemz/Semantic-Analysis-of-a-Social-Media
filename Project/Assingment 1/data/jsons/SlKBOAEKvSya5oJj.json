( Mike Blake/Reuters )\nThe Democratic coalition of upscale whites and racial and ethnic minorities is concentrated in a few areas , leaving many states to go narrowly for the GOP .\nRecently , it seems as though a growing chorus of progressives have begun to complain about how our governing institutions distort the true will of the voters . The Daily Beast recently published an illustrative example of this genre by David Faris :\nThe Democratic candidate has won a popular vote majority in six of the last seven presidential elections . Over that same time period , Democrats have secured 30 million more votes for the U.S. Senate than their Republican counterparts . In 2016 alone , Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes , and Democratic candidates received 11 million more votes for the Senate . The record here is clear : Over the past 26 years , the American people have voted , over and over again , to give Democrats the authority to staff the federal judiciary with living constitutionalists , and instead what they have received is a Supreme Court that remains in the death grip of a radical , conservative majority and lower courts that have flipped back and forth between Democratic and Republican appointees . Here , as in so many other ways , American democracy has misfired by hewing to institutions and procedures cooked up over candlelight a hundred years before the invention of the internal combustion engine .\nTo be clear : Bill Clinton , Al Gore , and Hillary Clinton did not win popular majorities . They won pluralities . Only George W. Bush and Barack Obama have won a majority of the vote in the last 30 years . Also , I \u2019 m not sure why 1876 \u2014 the year the internal combustion engine was invented \u2014 should serve as the demarcation point for determining whether political institutions are outmoded or still relevant .\nThe Left , it seems to me , has turned its ire on two main targets : the Senate and the Electoral College . The latter is simply a pass-through institution at this point ; the real target of progressive frustration with the Electoral College is its apportionment of political power not strictly by population but also by state . This is the same problem that liberals have with the Senate .\nThere are good reasons to dislike this style of apportionment , which I have acknowledged here at NRO . But the argument is a timeless one . James Madison himself made it all the way back in the summer of 1787 ( by candlelight , I should add ) . I am not so much interested in debating the relative merits of any given system of apportionment as in understanding why Democrats care about this issue now . The answer , I reckon , is the collapse of the Left \u2019 s traditional farmer\u2013labor coalition .\nThe evolution of the Democratic coalition can be appreciated by looking at presidential elections in which the party won or lost the Electoral College narrowly . These instances do a good job of illustrating the constituencies that are central to the party \u2019 s political identity .\nWoodrow Wilson was the first progressive Democrat ( sorry , Grover Cleveland ) , and he narrowly won reelection in 1916 against progressive Republican Charles Evans Hughes . This was the vindication of the farmer\u2013labor coalition he had built four years prior . In 1916 , Wilson won most of the rural South and West , while Hughes almost swept New England and performed well in the industrialized Old Northwest . For Wilson , a key difference between victory and defeat was in Ohio , where he won the manufacturing towns of Cleveland and Toledo .\nFast-forward to 1948 , when Harry Truman ran as a seeming underdog against Republican Thomas Dewey . Truman pulled off the victory , despite losing much of the Deep South to Strom Thurmond , by securing a strong performance in the rural West . And again , Ohio was highly important , as Truman won Toledo , Cleveland , and Youngstown .\nAs the 20th century wore on , the West began migrating to the GOP . Republican Gerald Ford nearly won a full term to the White House in 1976 by sweeping the West except Hawaii . But Jimmy Carter carried the day by nearly sweeping the South and ( once again ) winning key industrial areas in Ohio . So , as late as 1976 , the farmer\u2013labor coalition was still holding up .\nBy the end of the century , though , enormous changes had transformed the Democratic party , as evidenced by Al Gore \u2019 s narrow loss in 2000 . Gore \u2019 s Electoral College vote was concentrated on the West Coast , the mid-Atlantic , and New England , reflecting the growing prominence of upscale whites and minorities in the party \u2019 s coalition . Meanwhile , George W. Bush swept the South . He also he did very well in the Upper Midwest . Gore held on to a sufficiently large share of working-class Democrats in Iowa , Wisconsin , and Minnesota to carry those states , but his margins were very thin .\nThe trend of 2000 became more pronounced in 2004 . And in certain places , we saw it persist during the Barack Obama years as well . Though Obama held on to the Upper Midwest , the Democratic position in places like western Pennsylvania began to collapse , as this region \u2014 which had largely voted for Walter Mondale over Ronald Reagan \u2014 voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 . Similarly , states that had once been competitive for Democrats \u2014 West Virginia , Kentucky , Tennessee , Missouri , Arkansas , and Louisiana \u2014 all fell solidly into the Republican column . On net , this did not make a difference , because Obama further developed the \u201c rising \u201d Democratic coalition of minorities and upscale whites to win reelection , albeit with fewer Electoral College votes and a smaller share of the popular vote than he won in 2008 .\nIn 2016 , Hillary Clinton won the same basic coalition that Obama had expanded four years prior . But the last remnants of the old farmer\u2013labor coalition bolted to Donald Trump , who nearly swept the Midwest . He even almost took Minnesota , which has not voted Republican since 1972 . Also , in a telling development , he carried Ohio by eight percentage points , a larger margin than either side has enjoyed in 30 years .\nThese developments show that coalitions in this country change , for all manner of social , economic , and technological regions . This is part of the natural course of our politics , and not at all lamentable .
