She \u2019 s confident enough that she sent out a funny tweet during the Super Bowl : \u201c It \u2019 s so much more fun to watch FOX when someone else is being blitzed & sacked ! \u201d ( That garnered more than 50,000 retweets . )\nShe hugged President Obama a bit closer in a letter to a former Senate colleague , saying the administration \u2019 s sanctions \u201c are responsible for driving Tehran to the negotiating table \u201d and that in the nuclear talks \u201c we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed . \u201d\nNational Journal says that since Hillary hasn \u2019 t been in a political role since 2008 , there \u2019 s a huge gap in what we know about her views on more recent issues :\n\u201c When the National Security Agency was found to be spying on foreign leaders , the former secretary of State was mum . Americans cringed recently on learning that Clinton has n't driven a car since 1996 but can only guess at the former senator 's views on fracking in New York , her home state . Her position on Obama 's executive order delaying deportation of children brought to this country illegally ? Who knows ? \u201d\nAnd Clinton will have to address those one by one if she runs . But the response to a segment on Sunday \u2019 s \u201c Media Buzz \u201d made me think there is more of an elephant in the room than I realized .\nWe were examining Rand Paul bringing up Monica Lewinsky on \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d and whether the senator should have resurrected Bill \u2019 s awful misconduct as a potential 2016 issue for his wife . While that brought Paul , who is weighing his own White House run , plenty of attention , it seemed to cast Hillary as somehow being responsible for her husband \u2019 s sins . ( Yes , Paul was responding to a question about something his wife had said , but he clearly chose to escalate the issue . )\nBased on a torrent of reaction on e-mail , Twitter and Facebook , Rand Paul touched more of a nerve than I imagined .\nSome obvious caveats : Most of these messages are from people who don \u2019 t like Hillary Clinton and wouldn \u2019 t vote for her under any circumstances . Some make factual assertions that are untrue or unproven . But they show how the passions of the \u2019 90s\u2014and the endlessly debated question of Hillary \u2019 s marriage\u2014may lie just below the surface of her potential candidacy .\nMark in Wisconsin : \u201c We all know Hillary was aware Bill was womanizing before Monica and we all know Hillary actively played a role in publicly and privately attacking women like [ Juanita ] Broaddrick and [ Kathleen ] Willey . Why did n't you point out that Hillary played a role in the public smearing of Bill \u2019 s many victims and why did you pretend that Monica was Bill 's only victim when he has dozens of victims going back to his college years ? \u201d\nAngela in California : \u201c Could it be that Rand Paul and some others are concerned that if Bill Clinton gets back into the White House he will have access to other interns like Monica Lewinsky ? Obviously Hillary does n't have control over what her husband does and he has shown he does n't either especially when it comes to easy target interns . \u201d\nMary in California : `` It 's not Bill 's sins imputed to Hillary . It 's the reflection on either Hillary 's character or judgment . Either she was clueless about his indiscretions ( not credible , but if so would indicate that she has no ability to perceive and judge events ) , or she knew but felt it was in her better interests to stay quiet and reap the benefits of being the FLOTUS despite her husband being a serial sexual predator and abuser of his position of power . \u201d\nSince Bill Clinton \u2019 s extracurricular relationships go back to Gennifer Flowers , I doubt Hillary was totally unaware of his horndog ways . Certainly the Paula Jones lawsuit must have been an eye-opener . But there \u2019 s no evidence that the first lady knew her husband was involved with Lewinsky ; in fact , both agree that he lied to her , and it was on that basis that she went on television and blamed the \u201c vast right-wing conspiracy . \u201d\nNor is there a shred of evidence that Hillary smeared anyone in connection with Bill \u2019 s love life .\nObviously Bill would be moving back into the White House in a second Clinton presidency , so for those who can \u2019 t stand him , or still think women aren \u2019 t safe around him , that \u2019 s reason enough to avoid the two-for-the-price-of-one package ( as Clinton initially pitched his candidacy in 1992 ) .\nBut is the subtext of a Hillary campaign going to be the internal dynamics of her marriage and yet another argument about whether she should have dumped her husband in 1998 ?
