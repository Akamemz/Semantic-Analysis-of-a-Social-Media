    "content": "Bangladesh has been a vulnerable state for much of its short existence . People in this flood-prone country have coped with rising water levels with a combination of innovation , flexibility and resilience \u2013 but the extremes the environment is now throwing at them might be beyond anyone \u2019 s endurance .\nAs climate change accelerates , the pressures on rural Bangladeshis mount . Where previously people might have been able to move away for the worst of seasonal flooding , the regularity of waterlogging is making it impossible to farm . Crop varieties can not cope with the saltwater , and career alternatives are limited .\nWhat , then , can be done for the most vulnerable people ; the rural rice farmers of Bangladesh ?\nHistorically , people in Bangladesh had worked around seasonal flooding ; farming for part of the year and retreating when water levels rose , or seeking work in the cities as land became unusable .\nBy the end of the century , however , sea levels are expected to rise along the Bangladesh coastline by up to 1.5m . And that will come with more extreme seasonal fluctuations in sea levels . Disastrous storms and unusually high tides currently occur once each decade , but could become as regular as three to 15 times each year by 2100 .\nAs a result , rural Bangladeshis face a stark choice ; change their way or life or seek employment and a home elsewhere .\n\u201c The climate is becoming more volatile so we are seeing higher frequency of migration , \u201d says Joyce Chen , an economist at The Ohio State University . \u201c Where in the past we see migration due to annual flooding , or river bank erosion , now we see saltwater intrusion more commonly which affects the environment long term . It makes it harder to grow crops because the land is permanently altered by the saline water. \u201d In the past , he says , people could go to work in the city for a few months while the land was flooded and return when the flood had retreated . Now that is no longer possible . \u201c People realise it is not viable to stay . \u201d\nFor some , the saltwater offers an opportunity . Where rice might have once grown , shrimp farms are taking over \u2013 the saltwater providing the right environment to switch to aquaculture .\n\u201c When we look at people converting from agricultural production , households seem to maintain their production pretty well by switching to aquaculture , \u201d says Chen . \u201c They seem pretty resilient . But , the ways they are being resilient now need to be sustainable into the future . How sustainable will aquaculture be ? If enough people convert and there is too much saline intrusion that could create new problems and distort the economy in ways people can not predict . \u201d\nThe art of re-routing water using earth walls to create artificial islands for farming is perhaps best-known as a Dutch initiative . People in Bangladesh have also taken to building polders , as they are known , to protect their farm land . However , tensions arise when some farmers want to protect their agricultural land , on which they are growing rice , from saltwater intrusion while neighbouring farmers might inundate their land with saltwater in order to start farming shrimp .\n\u201c Anecdotes suggest that building sea walls and structures to keep the seawater out may be creating problems more than helping in that it creates conflict , \u201d says Chen . \u201c There are groups that want to allow more saltwater in to convert from agriculture to aquaculture . It benefits those that want to convert but not everyone is doing so . The seawater and levees allow more control which in some cases worsens the salinity problem . \u201d\nChen says there may now be 100,000 people migrating each year due to saltwater flooding , but it is hard to estimate accurately because the changing wider economy is also affecting migration . A strong economy in India attracts workers , too , who often seek construction or agricultural work .\nMobile phones are one way to keep track of where people are moving , Chen has found . There are around 145m Sim card connections in Bangladesh , accounting for 87 % of the population , although people change sim cards often and some people keep multiple phones . The high penetration of mobiles in Bangladesh is due to much of the population being reliant on them for banking . Mobile banking allows one person to work in a city as a migrant sending money home . Previously you might have had to wait several months for them to return with cash .\n\u201c We see both types of migration going on in Bangladesh \u2013 better opportunities in cities attracting workers or , in the case of climate change , they are moving because changes in the environment are making it hard to make ends meet , \u201d says Chen .\nAs a low-lying country , Bangladesh has always been a vulnerable area to changing sea levels , so adapting and migrating are not unusual demands . Chen says people in Bangladesh are on a good path of economic growth at the moment , but the volatile climate makes it hard to predict whether this growth will continue .\nSome Bangladeshis have tried to adapt their crops to the new conditions , but with limited success . \u201c We have heard a little about switching to types of crops that are more saline-tolerant but I do n't think there are that many varieties that exist , \u201d says Chen .\nResearchers in China have suggested that they have developed saltwater-resistant strains of rice , but there is little peer-reviewed evidence that these strains are viable , and the water in which the crops were tested contained only 10 % the concentration of salt found in seawater .\nMigrants moving within Bangladesh are attracted to the larger cities which for the most part are on the coast . Chen warns that this still leaves many people vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels .
