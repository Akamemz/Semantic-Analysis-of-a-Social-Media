    "content": "A lackluster compromise bill to reauthorize and reform federal surveillance powers has been released , and privacy rights activists on both the left and the right are speaking out against it .\nAt the end of the week , the USA Freedom Act will sunset if it 's not renewed . Passed after Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) was secretly using the Patriot Act to collect mass amounts of Americans ' phone and internet records , the act formalized the process but also added restrictions on the ability of the feds to actually access that information .\nThe feds have actually abandoned the practice of collecting and retaining all our metadata because\u2014surprise ! \u2014not only is it a violation of our privacy rights , it 's not a particularly effective way of fighting terrorism or crime .\nNevertheless , the government , once granted power , rarely gives it up completely . Rather than simply letting these authorities all expire , Congress is hammering out a renewal with reforms intended to further restrict the ability to use those powers against Americans without getting a warrant first .\nBut there 's little agreement on what those reforms should look like . Yesterday evening , Reps. Jerry Nadler ( D\u2013N.Y . ) and Adam Schiff ( D\u2013Calif . ) introduced the compromise bill they 're pushing forward as ranking members of the House Judiciary Committee and House Select Intelligence Committee , respectively . The bill is H.R . 6172 , the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act .\nThis bill is not a compromise designed to truly embrace the proposition that the U.S. government should n't secretly snoop on its own citizens . Rather it 's about eliminating its worst excesses , some of which have already stopped on their own , and preserving the general nature of the authority .\nOne of the good things the bill does is completely eliminate the call records collection program . These have already been stopped , but it was the NSA 's own decision because it was ineffective and they kept accidentally collecting more data than they were permitted . This also means that under current law , the NSA could decide to fire it back up . These reforms would stop it from happening .\nThe proposed reforms would also prohibit authorities treating cell location and global positioning system ( GPS ) information as though they 're part of a `` business record '' ( meaning the agencies will treat collecting this data as a form of surveillance subject to stricter regulation ) .\nThe proposal would require the destruction of collected records of Americans after five years , but there are so many exceptions that it 's hard to treat these stipulations seriously . One of the exceptions allows the feds to retain records if they 're `` enciphered or reasonably believed to have a secret meaning , '' strongly suggesting that they can store data just on the basis of it being encrypted , which online communications increasingly are .\nDirectly related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendment ( FISA ) Court warrants approved to wiretap Carter Page and the serious problems with the FBI 's behavior , there are some reforms that are not connected to the authorities provided by the USA Freedom Act .
