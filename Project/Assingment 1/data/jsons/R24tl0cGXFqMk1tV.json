It is what the self-consciously center-left element in American politics started calling itself after the word \u201c liberal \u201d was made into a term of abuse by the center-right element in American politics , which is made up mainly of liberals . Funny little eccentricities of the language : There are among our so-called liberal Democrats few surviving liberals and a rapidly declining number of democrats . And , thanks to the efforts of such excellent gentlemen as Jonah Goldberg and Glenn Beck in explaining the ugly history of American progressivism , \u201c progressive \u201d has become a term of abuse , too , especially on the talk-radio/cable-news right , which is why some people get so very upset when you point out that Donald Trump is a progressive .\nThe anti-Trump Right has an interest in establishing that conservatism is not Trump-ism , but there is more to it than that . Trump \u2019 s progressivism has to be understood in the context of his political and ideological forebears , many of whom our contemporary self-proclaimed progressives do not wish to claim , among them George Wallace and the segregationist Southern Democrats who lorded over American domestic politics between the Great Depression and the Reagan era .\nLet me begin by anticipating a complaint : Progressives will complain that one can not in good faith describe Trump as a progressive because contemporary progressives do not much like him , and indeed oppose him strongly , even to the point of unreason . That opposition , however , is not rooted in deep disagreements over policy or ideology but in pure tribalism . Donald Trump thinks that free-trade deals are depressing American wages and that an \u201c open borders \u201d immigration regime is the work of Wall Street and big-business interests trying to undermine the American working class . So does Bernie Sanders . Trump , sitting on his golden toilet on Fifth Avenue , somehow emerged as the tribune of the rural working classes , while Sanders , who represents one of the whitest and most rural states , was the favorite of urban cosmopolitans \u2014 which is weird enough , but consider that they did it while pushing policy agendas that were substantially identical in many fundamental ways .\nBut the fact that a candidate pushing classic progressivism rubs most progressives the wrong way does not alter his commitment to progressivism , which is to say , to the preference for the political regimentation of society over laissez-faire economic policies and organic social development . The central public-policy question of American progressivism , as Walter Nugent puts it in his useful Progressivism : A Very Short Introduction ( part of an Oxford University Press series of \u201c Very Short Introductions \u201d ) from the beginning has been : \u201c How could economic life be made fair again ? \u201d Classical progressives , he writes , \u201c favored using some form and degree of government . . . to regulate economic problems , ameliorate social ills , and reconcile change with tradition. \u201d The first two are still very much the central concerns of progressives , though reconciling change with tradition has been thrown overboard in these days of prosecuting nonconformist bakers as civil-rights villains .\nWoodrow Wilson , the father of American progressivism , would no doubt have vexed modern progressives with his backward and primitive racial views \u2014 views that were backward and primitive even by the standards of his time . Those \u201c conservative \u201d Southern Democrats were in the main recognizable as modern progressives , as indeed was George Wallace : They were supporters of social insurance and welfare-state programs ; minimum-wage laws and much ( but not all ) other pro-labor regulation , with Wallace being an energetic opponent of right-to-work laws ; they supported the trust-busting and anti-monopoly projects and generally favored a strong regulatory hand on business , particularly on international trade and banking ; Southern segregationists such as Wallace and Theodore Bilbo were notoriously fond of extravagant public-works spending , and , as governor , Bilbo was a notable champion of progressive measures such as compulsory education , bank regulation , and public-health projects . This stands in broad contrast to the conservative Republicans of the era , who were for their part mainly recognizable as modern conservatives : anti-tax , anti-spending , anti\u2013New Deal , small-government men , including arch-conservatives such as \u201c Mr . Republican \u201d Robert Taft , who also attempted to put together a far-reaching civil-rights bill in 1946 \u2014 a project scuttled by progressives .\nBut don \u2019 t take my word for it : You can read Ira Katznelson on this stuff , or Ta-Nahesi Coates , or dozens of left-leaning scholars \u2014 or , even better , you can go back and look at the actual records of those segregationist Democrats on issues like the creation of Social Security , the Davis-Bacon Act , bank regulations , etc .\nProgressivism is not a set of cultural inclinations but a body of public-policy views .\nThe point of all this is not to argue that modern progressives ought to be tarred with the racism of their intellectual forebears , much less to suggest that modern progressives are in the main racists , covertly or otherwise . Rather , the point is to establish the opposite : Progressivism is not a set of cultural inclinations but a body of public-policy views , mainly economic , along with related assumptions about the role and capacities of government . The contemporary Left \u2019 s attempt to define \u201c conservative \u201d as bigotry and \u201c progressivism \u201d as liberation from such bigotry is juvenile , and it is historically illiterate .\nThe American Left is for all practical purposes entirely progressive , which is to say , entirely committed to a managerial view of the role of government rooted in implacable , indeed irrational , hostility to the laissez-faire posture . But there is a progressive element within the Right as well : William F.
