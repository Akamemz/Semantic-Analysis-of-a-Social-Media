There was little change from the last test three years ago, the OECD said.\n\nLackluster results for the U.S. on the PISA have fueled calls for the country to improve its education standards or risk falling further behind advancing Asian economies. Concerns about U.S. academic performance have helped give rise to the Common Core State Standards Initiative, designed to align and raise expectations for learning across the country. More than 40 states have adopted the standards, although some are delaying implementation because of concerns about a federal takeover of education.\n\n\u201cThe systems that are making the most progress have embraced rigorous curriculums for their kids, and we need to do the same thing,\u201d said Wendy Kopp, founder of Teach for America, the nonprofit group that places college graduates in teaching positions at low-performing schools. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make progress without adopting globally benchmarked standards for our kids.\u201d\n\nMath Performance\n\nOnly 2 percent of U.S. students reached the highest level of math performance, compared with the OECD average of 3 percent and 31 percent of the students in Shanghai. The U.S. also had a larger percentage of students at the bottom of the scale compared with the OECD average.\n\nAbout 510,000 students around the world took the exam, first administered in 2000.
