Its purpose was even more improbable : A chat forum to discuss alleged war crimes they said their chief , a decorated sniper and medic , committed on a recent tour of duty in Iraq .\nThe WhatsApp group would eventually lead to formal allegations that Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher fatally stabbed a wounded Islamic State captive in his care and shot civilians in Iraq in 2017 .\nA jury of mostly combat Marines will ultimately decide the fate of the 19-year-veteran and Bronze Star recipient charged with murder , attempted murder and conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline for posing with the corpse for photographs .\nNo matter the outcome , the court-martial at Naval Base San Diego has provided a rare view into the insular Navy SEAL community and likely will have a long-term impact on one of the military \u2019 s most secretive and revered forces .

A jury of five Marines and two sailors , one a SEAL , will weigh whether Gallagher , on his eighth deployment , went off the rails and fatally stabbed the war prisoner as a kind of trophy kill , or if the boy died from wounds sustained in an airstrike and Gallagher is being falsely accused by junior SEALs trying to permanently oust a platoon chief they hate .\nNearly a dozen SEALs have testified over the past two weeks .
