    "content": "Happy holidays , fellow soldiers in the War on Christmas . It is the time of year when many Americans are expected to spend some time with people they are related to . Maybe some of the people you are related to listen to talk radio or read Twitchy . That does n't have to be a problem \u2014 as always , the first rule of arguing politics over the holidays is never ever do it ever \u2014 but if some things come up , and you want to have your say , perhaps you need some help countering the easily digestible sound bytes of the conservative media machine . Here is a guide .\nIt has only been a few weeks since the last holiday argument guide , but in those weeks the right has moved on from criticizing the nationwide launch of a complex series of health insurance markets to ... complaining about the persecution of a homophobic television character and making fun of a stock photo model . So let 's move on with them , I guess .\nWell , let 's just get this bit out of the way : No , the First Amendment does not apply to private corporations , like A & E Networks . The `` Duck Dynasty '' guy has a contract with a corporation that allows them to suspend or fire him if they feel like it . That 's how private contracts work , and private contracts are what modern capitalism is built on . A & E felt that the best thing they could do from a business perspective is suspend the duck guy after he said a bunch of offensive things . Sorry , if that makes you mad , you are mad at the free market , not liberals .\nMaybe you think Phil Robertson 's remarks \u2014 essentially that butts are gross \u2014 are in fact a brave statement of an endangered point of view . They sort of are ! But much of America has decided that that particular point of view deserves to become an anachronism , and they did not come to that conclusion because the liberal media has silenced those who argue that butts are gross . In fact it is quite easy to hear variations on that sentiment , from prominent political and media figures who are under no threat of being silenced . But the message just is n't resonating anymore , because it 's stupid .\nIt is also maybe worthwhile to remember that in addition to his sophisticated musings on sexuality , the duck guy effectively endorsed racial segregation and Jim Crow .\nIt is actually the case that there are a lot of potential and actual problems with a system in which employees can be punished by their bosses for the expression of certain beliefs outside the workplace . But just as celebrities do n't have the same reasonable expectation of privacy that normal civilians are supposed to enjoy under the law , they also ca n't expect the same freedom to express unpopular or controversial opinions without fear of economic reprisal . I mean , if your wealth and status depend on appealing to the broadest swath of Americans possible , most people would tell you to avoid controversy . ( It is obviously also possible to have fame that depends on the generation of controversy , and it seems like the duck people might switch over to that line of work sooner or later . )\nBut let 's think about these duck guys , this Robertson family with the television show that millions of people watch . Maybe this is the north enforcing its cultural hegemony at the expense of an innocent southern man , tarred as a bigot and kicked off his own television show just for saying what he thinks . But if you are southern , maybe you should think some more about the Robertsons and their television show and what message it sends to the rest of the country .\nThe Robertson family is a gang of college-educated millionaires pretending to be backwoods hillbillies . The beards and camo are literally costumes . Before they had a television show they were clean-shaven yuppies in polo shirts and cargo shorts . The Robertsons are performing a pantomime of southernness , and it is making them even richer than they were before . They are performing for a nationwide audience that is probably not mostly southern , and that is definitely not mostly rural and southern . No one on reality television \u2014 especially in this era , when it 's more staged than ever \u2014 is being their authentic self . That 's not in and of itself a problem ; entertainment is entertainment .
