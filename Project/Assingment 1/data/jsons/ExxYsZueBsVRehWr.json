    "content": "Donald Trump crowed for months he would strike a `` terrific '' deal on health care . His ambitions ended in a brief phone call Friday afternoon , in which Speaker Paul Ryan told him the truth : He was nowhere close .\nThe businessman president , who sold himself to tens of millions of disillusioned voters last year as the only outsider who could tame a broken capital , ended his first confrontation with lawmakers overmatched , outmaneuvered and ultimately empty-handed .\n\u201c We learned a lot about some very arcane rules , \u201d Trump said in the Oval Office soon after the defeat of his effort to undo President Obama \u2019 s health care law .\nIt was actually the most basic fact of Congress that set Trump back : the majority rules . And despite a 22-seat margin for error in the House , Trump had proved unable to corral support for a plan to repeal the law , one of Trump \u2019 s key campaign pledges .\nHis failure to advance legislation through a single chamber of Congress controlled by members of his own party \u2014 despite it being a cornerstone of the Republican agenda for more than half-decade \u2014 casts doubt both on Trump \u2019 s much-bragged-about dealmaking skills and the GOP \u2019 s path forward .\n\u201c It 's a black eye for the speaker and the president , \u201d said Scott Reed , the top strategist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which supported the measure .\nThe setback , described in interviews with multiple senior administration and congressional officials , was especially humiliating because Trump was sunk not by Democrats but by his inability to ride herd over the same rebellious element of the Republican conference that previously bucked Speaker Paul Ryan \u2019 s predecessor John Boehner out of his job . Most House Republicans have never served in the majority under a Republican president and it \u2019 s unclear how in the future they will cobble together a governing coalition .\n\u201c The Republican Party is still operating as an opposition party , \u201d said Josh Holmes , a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who added , \u201c If they ca n't break the fever\u2026it says an enormous amount about the prospects of tax reform , infrastructure and some sort of immigration proposal . \u201d\nTrump himself seemed almost relieved to move on from the health care fight , even as other White House officials were fretting about the long-term implications of what one senior White House official called a `` clear embarrassment for us . ''\nThe president himself wasn \u2019 t nearly as upset about the health care defeat as he was about the size of his inauguration crowds , Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2019 decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia \u2019 s meddling in the 2016 election or the repeated legal setbacks on his travel-ban executive order , which has been blocked by multiple courts . \u201c No bullshit , I think he 's actually pretty comfortable with the outcome . He wants to move ahead and do taxes , \u201d another senior White House official said .\nBut tax reform \u2014 which no president or Congress has been able to tackle successfully for more than three decades \u2014 is no easy task , especially as Republicans had banked on deficit-cutting from any health package to give them a financial cushion in that endeavor . \u201c Yes , \u201d Ryan conceded Friday , \u201c this does make tax reform more difficult . \u201d\nFor weeks Trump had seemed disinterested and disengaged from the specifics of the health care fight , both behind closed doors with his aides and at public rallies . Trump \u201c just wanted to get something he could sign , \u201d said one adviser who talks to him frequently . \u201c He was over it. \u201d He would often interrupt conversations on the law to talk about other issues , advisers and aides said .\nIn one phone call with Ryan earlier this month , Trump told the House speaker that he had a problem with the bill . It wasn \u2019 t over Medicaid expansion , maternity coverage , deductibles or insurance premiums . Rather , it was that he didn \u2019 t like the word \u201c buckets \u201d \u2014which Ryan had been using to describe the parts of their plan .\n\u201c I do n't like that word buckets . You throw trash in buckets . I do n't like that word , \u201d Trump said , according to two people familiar with the call . Trump preferred \u201c phases. \u201d Ryan agreed and adopted the term .\nIt was the kind of messaging detail Trump focused on during the campaign , when he described his plan as \u201c repeal and replace \u2014 with something terrific. \u201d But by February , Trump confided to a group of the nation \u2019 s governors visiting Washington D.C. that undoing Obamacare would be more involved . \u201c Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated , \u201d he said .\nIn the closing days of negotiations , Trump found himself stuck in the middle of an ideological tug-of-war between the two factions at the extremes of a deeply fissured House Republican conference \u2014 with every concession offered to the hardline House Freedom Caucus driving away votes from the moderate Tuesday Group , and vice versa .\nThe arguments for the legislation from the White House were political . \u201c This is your chance , \u201d press secretary Sean Spicer urged lawmakers on Friday hours before the bill died . The arguments against it were based in policy , where Trump was less comfortable .\nWhen Trump trekked to Capitol Hill to make his case in person on Tuesday , lawmakers were mostly nonplussed . \u201c Not a whole lot about health care , except to vote for it , \u201d Rep. Walter Jones , R-N.C. , said afterward . He remained opposed .\nOther lawmakers said Trump wasn \u2019 t at all conversant in the specifics and mainly wanted to talk about his popularity in their districts \u2013 or how voting against the proposed bill could hurt them politically .
