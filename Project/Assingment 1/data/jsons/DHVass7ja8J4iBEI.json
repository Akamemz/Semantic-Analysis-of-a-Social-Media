Both have called for a modern version of what Franklin D. Roosevelt called the Economic Bill of Rights : Medicare for all , tuition-free public education , universal day care , a Green New Deal to generate jobs while addressing climate change . Both would tax the wealthy and corporations to make vital public investments in the common good .\nThe other candidates \u2014 particularly Biden , Amy Klobuchar , Pete Buttigieg and Mike Bloomberg \u2014 have scoffed at these ideas as too radical , too bold , too costly , too ambitious . They offer mostly a continuation of the politics that existed before Donald Trump disrupted the country . The problem with that , of course , is that it doesn \u2019 t offer much hope for most Americans .\nSanders calls himself a \u201c democratic socialist. \u201d Warren objects to that label and says she \u2019 s for making markets work . But this is a difference in labels , not in substance . Their agendas are remarkably similar .

The important word in \u201c democratic socialism \u201d isn \u2019 t socialism , it \u2019 s democratic . Sanders isn \u2019 t talking about making America into Cuba or Venezuela ; he \u2019 s talking about extending social guarantees like those offered in most other advanced industrial states , invoking Denmark or Sweden . These countries have universal health care at lower cost , paid family leave , guaranteed paid vacations , higher minimum wages , more generous public retirement programs .

The Food and Drug Administration , which ensures that drugs are safe is a state program . The minimum wage , food stamps , public housing could all be considered democratic socialist programs .\nOur problem has been that we have too much socialism for the rich and the powerful \u2014 subsidies for corporations , get out of jail free cards for crooked bankers , tax breaks for the rich that leaves them paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries , monopoly power for corporations that allows them to gouge customers and more .\nAnd we have too little shared security \u2014 democratic socialism \u2014 for working people : affordable health care , a living wage , guaranteed paid vacation and family leave , universal childcare , affordable college , public mobilization to deal with the threat of climate change .\nWhen I ran for the presidency , I didn \u2019 t use the label , although some tried to slur me as a socialist or a communist , but I don \u2019 t think the label makes any difference . The question is one of direction , not name-calling ; of program , not posturing .\nAnd on this , Dr. Martin Luther King \u2014 often smeared as a \u201c red \u201d or a communist \u2014 was very clear . In 1966 , he confided to his staff :\n\u201c You can \u2019 t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars . You can \u2019 t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of the slums . You \u2019 re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then . You are messing with captains of industry . Now this means that we are treading in difficult water , because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism .

There \u2019 s no question we need big structural change , as Elizabeth Warren puts it .
