    "content": "The Jewish vote in presidential elections always goes to the Democrats , with only a small percentage going to the GOP . In 2016 , Hillary Clinton received 71 percent of it , while Donald Trump got only 24 percent . It \u2019 s a small vote\u2014just 3 percent of the total in 2016 , according to exit polls\u2014but it \u2019 s important because in states like Florida , that small percentage could mean the difference between victory and defeat .\nIf Bernie Sanders becomes the nominee of the Democratic Party in 2020 , that could tilt things toward defeat .\nA recent Pew Research Poll reveals that 31 percent of American Jews support Joe Biden for the nomination , while only 11 percent support Sanders . While 13 percent of Jews approve of Trump \u2019 s performance as president , 48 percent do not . Twenty-four percent of Jews say they will vote for Trump in 2020 , matching his 2016 support , but just 57 percent say they \u2019 ll vote for the Democratic candidate .\nThe Jewish vote is certainly not a monolith . Some Jews will support Trump because they agree with his Israel policy while disagreeing on domestic policies ; others do n't agree with Sanders but might vote for him anyway because they think it important to cast their vote for a candidate , who if he wins , would be the first Jewish president in the United States .\nNevertheless , as Frank Newport shows in Polling Matters , most American Jews support Israel and want a presidential candidate to be pro-Israel . He writes : \u201c The overwhelming majority of Jews were more sympathetic to Israel than the Palestinians in 2001-2014 , and I see no signs that this relationship has changed in a meaningful way in recent years. \u201d Today , 86 percent of Jews are sympathetic to Israel , according to the results of a 2015-2019 poll sample . It declined a bit from an earlier sample , but Newport writes that it \u201c is not meaningfully different from the 93 % we found in the 2001-2014 sample . \u201d\nOn Sunday , Sanders tweeted that he would not attend the forthcoming AIPAC conference , because the pro-Israel lobbying group provides a platform \u201c for leaders who express bigotry and oppose Palestinian rights. \u201d Immediately , he was met with a barrage of criticism from mainstream liberal Jewish groups . Jonathan Greenblatt , CEO of the Anti-Defamation League , who came from the Obama administration , called Sanders \u2019 tweet \u201c offensive \u201d and \u201c irresponsible. \u201d Similar remarks came from David Harris , head of the American Jewish Committee , and from Rabbi Rick Jacobs , president of the Union for Reform Judaism , and from the Jewish Democratic Council of America . Their followers are likely not to vote for Sanders should he get the nomination .\nOn domestic matters , American Jews , outside of the Orthodox communities , have been liberal since the days of F.D.R . and the New Deal . They have supported social reform , government measures to help the poor , and civil rights for African-Americans . Many times , Jewish groups have proudly displayed the photo of Martin Luther King . Jr. marching in Selma , Alabama in 1965 . Standing in the front row with King is the prominent Rabbi , Abraham Joshua Heschel .\nNew York City was the exception in the 1930s and 40s , when Jewish trade unionism flourished , and a portion of working-class Jews in the city predominated in the ranks of the American Communist Party . One section of the city in the Bronx was called \u201c the Red Belt , \u201d since its voters regularly cast their ballots on the line of the American Labor Party , which was taken over by the Communists in the 1940s . But during the Cold War , New York Jews deserted the ALP and supported a new liberal line created by a prominent anti-Communist who led the hatters \u2019 union , called the Liberal Party .\n\u201c American Jews are liberal . They have not , however , necessarily stood with the radical left wing . \u201d\nTo try and maintain the Jewish vote , Sanders has noticeably begun to identify himself publicly as Jewish , in contrast to his presidential campaign in 2016 , when he described his ethnicity as Polish . Last Tuesday , his campaign released a new video in which he proudly identifies himself as a Jew , emphasizes that many in his father \u2019 s family perished in the Holocaust , and calls attention to the growing threat of anti-Semitism in America .\nSanders also goes after Donald Trump , and a neo-Nazi group is shown on camera explaining that Trump \u2019 s election emboldened them .\nSanders also wrote a short column about his Jewish identity late last year for Jewish Currents . In his article , titled \u201c How to Fight Antisemitism in America , \u201d Sanders , referring to the 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh , wrote that \u201c President Donald Trump \u2019 s own words helped inspire the worst act of antisemitic violence in American history. \u201d Declaring \u201c I am a proud Jewish American , \u201d he said that anti-Semitism is not only a threat to Jews , \u201c it is also a threat to democratic governance itself . \u201d\nHe could have picked any of several mainstream Jewish publications to make his views known , but true to his socialist ideals , he chose to proclaim his Jewish identity in Jewish Currents , a small-circulation left-wing magazine that began publishing decades ago as a publication of the American Communist Party , and later , became a magazine identified with young Jewish New Leftists , and in this era as a publication speaking to the concerns of today \u2019 s young Jewish radicals .\nSanders is also anxious to show that he supports Israel . He explained that \u201c I have a connection to Israel going back many years . In 1963 , I lived on a kibbutz near Haifa . It was there that I saw and experienced for myself many of the progressive values upon which Israel was founded . I think it is very important for everyone , but particularly for progressives , to acknowledge the enormous achievement of establishing a democratic homeland for the Jewish people after centuries of displacement and persecution . \u201d\nIn other words , he is not anti-Israel , as many have argued . New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof seconded that , writing in a recent column , \u201c The accusation that Sanders , who lived on an Israeli kibbutz for a time and would be the first Jewish president , is anti-Israel is absurd . \u201d\nWhat Sanders did not explain , but which the Times of Israel did , is that the kibbutz he lived and worked in was not associated with the mainstream labor Zionist-socialist movement , but was part of a youth group affiliated with the far-left Mapam , called Hashomer Hatzair . Its members considered themselves Marxist-Leninists and Zionists , who supported the Soviet Union and its foreign policy during the Cold War years . Indeed , when Stalin died , its newspaper , On Guard , ran the headline `` The Progressive World Mourns the Death of J.V . Stalin . ''\nBeing in such a kibbutz doesn \u2019 t mean he couldn \u2019 t have been pro-Israel , of course . It \u2019 s just interesting that he glossed over that part of it , which could come up during a general election campaign .\nMoreover , Sanders \u2019 campaign \u2019 s official surrogates , who often appear with Sanders or speak on his behalf , include the virulently anti-Israel Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , who supports the BDS movement , and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota . ( You can find what they said that is anti-Semitic in Noah Rothman \u2019 s column ) . To give you one example , in 2012 , Omar spoke about \u201c the evil doings of Israel , \u201d and later argued that it was money\u2014 \u201c It \u2019 s all about the Benjamins , baby \u201d \u2014that explained American Jews \u2019 support of Israel . As for Tlaib , she said after her election that her colleagues in the House who oppose BDS \u201c forgot what country they represent , \u201d thus repeating an old anti-Semitic trope .\nThen , last Tuesday , Sanders added a third person to his list of surrogates , another openly anti-Zionist individual , an Arab-American named Amer Zahr , who describes himself as a comedian , activist , and professor . His tweets reveal his outlook .\nThese extreme views are hardly going to be seen as worthy by most liberal Jews , including those opposed to expansion of settlements and Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019 s foreign and domestic policy , including his outreach to authoritarian populist leaders in Europe .\nIt takes little imagination to see what the right and the Trumpists will do with this information . They will portray Sanders as a communist-leaning opponent of Israel , who appoints as surrogates individuals whose claim to fame is strong opposition to Israel .\nOn Tuesday , Matt Brooks , chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition , went on Fox and Friends to say that if Sanders was elected , he would be \u201c the first enemy of Israel in the White House . '' One need n't endorse that view to see what an issue this is going to be . Brooks also said this group would be premiering an anti-Sanders ad during Tuesday 's night 's debate on CBS . He did n't mention that it would only air in Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Arizona .\nAt the Tuesday Democratic debate in Charleston , South Carolina , the candidates were asked what they would do about the Trump administration moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . \u201c Would you move the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv ? , \u201d CBS moderator Major Garrett asked Sanders . \u201c The answer is , it \u2019 s something we would take into consideration , \u201d Sanders answered , while calling Netanyahu a \u201c reactionary racist . \u201d\nAlready , some Jewish voters in Florida are suspicious about whether the Democrats really support Israel . Of course , most Democrats do , but Trump \u2019 s attacks on a Sanders campaign would do a lot to disabuse them of that notion .
