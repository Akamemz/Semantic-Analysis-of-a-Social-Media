    "content": "The so-called `` fiscal cliff '' came tonight -- but now there is a specific deal on the table to try to soften it after the fact , according to congressional sources .\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , said the deal -- brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- would get a vote in the Senate sometime after midnight . The House would not vote before Tuesday afternoon at the earliest , sources said .\n`` I feel really very , very good about this vote , '' Biden told reporters leaving the meeting with Senate Democrats , `` but having been in the Senate for as long as I have there 's two things you should n't do : You should n't predict how the Senate is going to vote before they vote .... [ and ] you surely should n't predict about how the House is going to vote . ''\nThe proposal would extend Bush-era tax cuts permanently for people making less than $ 400,000 per year and households making less than $ 450,000 , the sources said .\nThe steep `` sequester '' budget cuts scheduled to go into effect with the New Year would be postponed two months , said sources . They said half the money would come from cuts elsewhere , and the other half from new revenue .\nThe deal also would affect taxes on investment income and estates , and extend unemployment benefits for a year , the congressional sources added .\n`` The end is in sight , '' said a Democratic aide with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's office . `` If everyone cooperates , it 's possible things can move pretty quickly . ''\nAfter the Biden meeting , Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , said there was `` strong '' support for the plan among Senate Democrats .\n`` There is a feeling that it 's not that this proposal is regarded as great or as loved in any way , but it 's a lot better than going off the cliff , '' he said .\nSen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , called the compromise the `` best '' that could be done .\nEven with progress in the Senate tonight , the `` cliff '' deadline will pass without action by the House , where Republican leaders said they would `` consider '' the deal starting tomorrow .\n`` Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation , '' said House Speaker John Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy , and Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers in a statement .\nThe failure of a deal to pass Congress by Jan. 1 technically triggers an income tax hike on all Americans and automatic spending cuts , though lawmakers could still prevent a tax hike by making retroactive any legislation that passes in the weeks ahead , experts said .\nThe deal at hand will not entirely solve the problem of the `` fiscal cliff , '' however . In fact , it could set up a new showdown over the same spending cuts in just two months that would be amplified by a brewing fight over how to raise the debt ceiling beyond $ 16.4 trillion . That new fiscal battle has the potential to eclipse the `` fiscal cliff '' in short order .\nEarlier , during a midday news conference , Obama said he was optimistic about compromise in the short-term .\n`` It appears that an agreement to prevent this New Year 's tax hike is within sight , but it 's not done , '' he said . `` There are still issues left to resolve , but we 're hopeful that Congress can get it done . ''\nIn addition to extending current tax rates for households making $ 450,000 or less , the latest plan would raise the estate tax from 35 to 40 percent for estates larger than $ 5 million ; and prevent the alternative minimum tax from hammering millions of middle-class workers , according to sources familiar with the talks .\nCapital gains taxes would rise to 20 percent from 15 , according to a senior White House official .\nThe deal would also extend for one year unemployment insurance benefits set to expire Tuesday , and avert a steep cut to Medicare payments for doctors , congressional sources said .\n`` I can report that we 've reached an agreement on the all the tax issues , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in an afternoon speech on the Senate floor .\nAt the time , McConnell said that federal spending cuts remained a sticking point . That hurdle later appeared to be cleared by postponing the debate two more months , though it is unclear whether House Republicans will go along .\n`` In order to get the sequester moved , you 're going to have to have real , concrete spending cuts , '' said Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Mich . Without that , he said , `` I do n't know how it passes the House . ''\nSome Republicans also said Obama unduly complicated progress toward an agreement by seeming to take a victory lap on taxes at his campaign-style event at the White House .\n`` Keep in mind that just last month Republicans in Congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans , '' Obama said , raising the ire of several Republicans . `` Obviously , the agreement that 's currently discussed would raise those rates , and raise them permanently . ''\nThose words drew a sharp retort from Republican Sen. John McCain .\nRather than staging a `` cheerleading rally , '' McCain said , the president should have been negotiating the finishing touches of the deal .\n`` He comes out and calls people together and has a group standing behind him , laughs and jokes and ridicules Republicans . Why ? '' said McCain .\nSeveral Democrats also voiced disappointment with the president and the emerging deal .\n`` This is one Democrat that does n't agree with that at all , '' Iowa Democratic Sen.
