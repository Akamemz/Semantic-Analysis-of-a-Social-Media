Exit polling showed the blue team made up 38 percent of the electorate , 6 points more than the red team , and 9 points more than independents .\nGiven the anguish within many precincts of the Republican Party today , it is safe to say Donald Trump will not get 93 percent of the Republican vote . The most recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll showed Trump with 80 percent of the Republican vote against Hillary Clinton , compared to 90 percent of Democrats who favor their party \u2019 s presumptive nominee .\nProvided there is no conservative third-party alternative on offer , both Clinton and Trump \u2019 s numbers will improve among members of their parties . But the gap will certainly persist . Add in the fact that Trump trails Clinton among independents by 6 points , and you have the makings for a bad beatdown .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders have a solution in mind for Trump : Change his substance and style in a bid to unite the GOP .\nThere are more Democrats in America than there are Republicans , and given the astonishing Obama turnout machine and the historically high Democratic intensity against Trump , there is no reason to believe this election will be different .\nWhile there are some questions about the intensity and party loyalty of African-American voters \u2013 13 percent of the electorate in 2012 \u2013 one suspects that the jaw-dropping anti-Trump intensity among Hispanic voters would likely make up for any slack in the Democratic coalition .\nJust as it was a cultural signifier for black Americans to vote for Barack Obama , it seems likely that Hispanic Americans will see a vote against Donald Trump in the same way . Taco bowl or no taco bowl .\nWe know that it \u2019 s state results not national polling that matters , but if Trump trails Clinton by anything like 10 points overall you can skip the state drilldown . You \u2019 re looking at a rout .\nBut the states can instruct us as to where Trump should be looking for his voters . One of the most discussed targets for a potential Trump flip is Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania is not very Republican ; just 35 percent in 2012 and only 20 percent independent .\nIf Trump really is going to be competitive in the Keystone State it would mean cracking into the 45 percent of the electorate that identified as Democrats last time around .\nIt is a good rule of thumb to say that the more unified party always wins , but given Trump \u2019 s attitudes and views , he will have to find another way .\nLet \u2019 s say Trump could push his share of the Republican vote 10 points higher , he would still lose to Clinton . And that \u2019 s assuming that GOP turnout stays relatively high , no guarantee in an election year that \u2019 s about as pleasant as amoebic dysentery on a mule train .\nAnd so , Ryan \u2019 s threat to Trump to withhold resources and support rings a little hollow . Trump is right to say that he probably doesn \u2019 t necessarily want their support . He needs money , but would do better hitting up his fellow billionaires and grass-roots donors than flogging an unwilling GOP donor base anyway .\nWhat Trump really needs is to give Hillary Clinton the same headache he \u2019 s got .\nTrump \u2019 s general-election focus of bashing free trade , calling for a foreign-policy pullback and increased domestic spending are all sweet music to the Bernie Bros . Yes , it is possible that Trump could lose more ground among the Republicans , but he needs the electorate to look very different to have a chance anyway . If Trump keeps trying to break up the Democratic coalition , it might work , or it might end up in a crash-and-burn season finale .\nBut Ryan \u2019 s call for a more conventional Trump candidacy would produce a predictable loss , though perhaps at a smaller margin . That would do Trump no better , but it would help Ryan and his party prevent down-ballot disasters .\nAs the negotiation between Trump and the GOP leadership plays out , Trump derives considerable leverage from the fact that he can \u2019 t win with them , but just might be able to win without them .\nDonald Trump \u2019 s stances have made him popular with voters , but many donors are hesitant to come to his side . But he needs the cash to take on Hillary Clinton . Will that be enough incentive for big money Republicans to open their wallets ?
