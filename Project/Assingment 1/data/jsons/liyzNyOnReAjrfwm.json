The measure allows victims to sue foreign sponsors of terrorism for attacks that take place on U.S. soil .\nThe bill is aimed squarely at Saudi Arabia \u2019 s ruling family , which is suspected of links to the hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11 , 2001 . Fifteen of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens .\nSaudi Arabia denies any connection to the attacks and lobbied fiercely against the bill .\nThe trouncing angered White House officials , who lashed out at what they saw as a wrongheaded move by lawmakers failing to consider the impact on U.S. foreign policy and personnel abroad .\n\u201c I would venture to say that this is the single most embarrassing thing that the United States Senate has done , possibly , since 1983 , \u201d Obama spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One .\nEarnest was responding to a reporter who informed him that the last time the Senate voted in such lopsided fashion to override a veto was in 1983 .
