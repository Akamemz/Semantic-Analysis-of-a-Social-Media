There are no eyewitnesses . You couldn \u2019 t build a case in court with this . What you could do is put a dent in someone \u2019 s political appeal , especially someone who boasts of passing the Violence Against Women Act . When asked by his media columnist Ben Smith about whether the delay was out of concern for Biden \u2019 s electoral chances , New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet protested energetically .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t make that calculation .

The timing on accusations like these often betray political calculation .\nThe networks are still delaying on Tara Reade . You can always demonstrate the media \u2019 s political calculations by noticing they \u2019 re not based on the evidence as much as they \u2019 re based on who is accused .\nIn the spring of 1991 , The New York Times spread the unsubstantiated gossip that Nancy Reagan had an affair with Frank Sinatra , according to the sleazy author Kitty Kelley , and the networks quickly followed . In the fall , these liberal titans all jumped quickly on NPR unfurling Anita Hill \u2019 s unproven sex-harassment charges against Clarence Thomas .\nBut in 1994 , this entire liberal media mob waited three months to notice Paula Jones charging Bill Clinton with sexual harassment . They all heard Jones make her allegations at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February , and aired nothing ( well , ABC gave it 16 seconds ) .\nIn 1999 , Juanita Broaddrick taped an interview and alleged Clinton raped her in Little Rock .
