    "content": "The most controversial presidential campaign in modern American history has sharpened a long-standing debate : Is it ethical to not vote ?\nMore than 92 million Americans who were eligible to vote four years ago did n't cast ballots . But politics in the Age of Trump has prompted editorial writers , Democratic partisans and even some Republicans to argue that Donald Trump is so unacceptable as a potential commander in chief that citizens have a heightened duty to show up to cast their ballot against him .\nSome Trump supporters , presumably including those who chant `` Lock her up ! '' at GOP rallies , feel the same way about Hillary Clinton .\n`` Let 's be clear : Elections aren \u2019 t just about who votes , but who doesn \u2019 t vote , '' first lady Michelle Obama said last week at a Clinton campaign rally at La Salle University in Philadelphia , with a cautionary message aimed at Millennials . `` And if you vote for someone other than Hillary , or if you don \u2019 t vote at all , then you are helping to elect Hillary \u2019 s opponent . And the stakes are far too high to take that chance , too high . ''\nConservative columnist Dorothy Rabinowitz struck a surprisingly similar tone in a message aimed at Republicans .\n`` Some among the anti-Hillary brigades have decided , in deference to their exquisite sensibilities , to stay at home on Election Day , rather than vote for Mrs. Clinton , '' she wrote in Friday 's The Wall Street Journal . But she warned , `` Her election alone is what stands between the American nation and the reign of the most unstable , proudly uninformed , psychologically unfit president ever to enter the White House . ''\nOn Team Trump , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani are among those who argue it is Clinton whose election would pose a threat to the republic . And some Republicans who oppose Trump make the case for sending a message by supporting a third-party candidate or not voting at all .\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush , vanquished by Trump in the GOP primaries , told reporters Thursday after delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University that he planned to vote , but not for Trump or Clinton . `` If everybody did n't vote , that would be a pretty powerful political statement , would n't it ? '' he said .\nTrump 's temperament \u2014 criticism of Muslim-American Gold Star parents , a late-night Twitter storm against a former beauty queen \u2014 and policy views that include skepticism of the NATO alliance and admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin have fueled alarm even among some life-long Republicans about whether he should be trusted with the nation 's highest office . Former president George H.W . Bush and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney are among those who have said they wo n't vote for Trump .\nBut concerns about Clinton , including questions about her honesty and trustworthiness , have complicated the calculations by some voters about just whom to support . All that has boosted Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson , whose 7.3 % level of support in the RealClearPolitics average of recent nationwide surveys is higher than any third-party candidate on Election Day since Ross Perot in 1996 .\nWhen both major-party candidates get negative ratings from most Americans , will more voters just stay home ?\nInspirational contenders tend to do best in drawing voters to the polls . The highest rate of turnout since World War II was 63.8 % of the voting-eligible population in 1960 , when a youthful Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy narrowly won the White House . After decades of more-or-less steady decline , it spiked again to 61.6 % in 2008 , when Illinois senator Barack Obama was elected the nation 's first African-American president .\nBut scholars say fear can be as compelling as hope .\n`` Fear is a pretty big motivator , just as is enthusiasm , '' says Michael Dimmock , president of the non-partisan Pew Research Center , which has studied voters and non-voters . Turnout in presidential elections tends to dip in years such as 1996 and 2000 , when voters do n't see the stakes as particularly high or the differences between the two major candidates as particularly sharp .\nNeither factor would apply this time . And high levels of interest this year may signal higher turnout .\nIn a Pew study released this summer , more than eight in 10 said they were following news about the candidates closely , the highest level of interest in a quarter century . Eight in 10 said they had thought `` quite a lot '' about the election . Three of four said it `` really matters '' who wins .\nThat said , two-thirds called the tone of the campaign too negative , and only four in 10 were satisfied with their choices , the lowest level in two decades . Just one in 10 said either candidate would make a good president . Four in 10 said neither would .\n`` We 've never had candidates like this for president , '' says Michael McDonald , a political scientist at the University of Florida who heads the United States Elections Project . He turns to Senate races for comparison , citing the 2010 Delaware contest when Democrat Chris Coons crushed Republican Christine O'Donnell . She was a controversial Tea Party-backed contender who , among other things , aired a TV ad denying she was a witch .\nDespite a contest that was n't seen as competitive , turnout in the First State was among the highest in the country last year .\n`` My guess is people are going to be activated to vote against these candidates , '' McDonald says . `` They may not like their particular candidate ... but they certainly do n't like the other party 's candidate . ''\n`` It 's not : 'How much do I like these people ? ' '' says Jan Leighley , an American University professor and co-author of Who Votes Now ? Demographics , Issues , Inequality and Turnout in the United States . `` It 's : 'Does it make a difference between this person I do not like opposed to that person I do not like ?
