    "content": "Kellie Falbo is tackling climate change one step at a time . That means lowering carbon emissions by driving a biodiesel vehicle , keeping a vegetable garden , and composting with worms .\nSure , those efforts by themselves won \u2019 t make much difference globally . But sitting in the Happy Lucky Tea House , which is proudly \u201c serving up world change \u201d ( according to the awning outside ) , she sees a constellation of small steps here in the heart of Colorado \u2019 s Larimer County that can ripple outward to address an overwhelming challenge .\nAbout 30 miles southeast , in neighboring Weld County , Steve Wells looks out over a very different picture .\nMore than 600 oil and gas wells dot the flat grasslands that extend to the horizon of his 35,000-acre ranch . Many of them involve hydraulic fracturing \u2013 the controversial drilling practice that Larimer County 's largest city , Fort Collins , tried to ban a few years back .\nHe gets angry when he talks about the activists who would like to ban fracking but who have never come to talk to him or bothered to see that the water hasn \u2019 t been damaged and that wildlife is thriving . The income from those wells has made an enormous financial difference for Wells , whose grandfather started the ranch in 1888 , allowing him to contribute to local charities , such as a local food bank and a women \u2019 s shelter .\nAs for man-made climate change ? He doesn \u2019 t believe it is happening .\nWhen it comes to global warming , the border between Weld and Larimer Counties might as well be a fault line .\nThey are two quintessentially Colorado counties \u2013 Weld stretching eastward from the shadow of the Rockies onto the wide and empty skirts of the high plains , while Larimer gathers up the cities that cluster against the foot of the Rockies north of Denver .\nBut their different character speaks to a broader divide nationwide . Weld voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 ; Larimer voted for President Obama . Larimer life rotates around Fort Collins , a college town as home of the local state university ; Weld considered seceding from the state in 2013 .\nThey are blue and red America in miniature , and their different approaches to climate change mirror the rift within America itself .\nPolls show that the partisan divide is wider on climate change than any other issue . In 2001 , the gap between Republicans and Democrats on whether climate change is real and human-caused was 17 percentage points . This year , the gap stands at 41 points . Just 43 percent of Republicans now believe climate change is human-caused , compared with 53 percent back then .\nWhat has happened ? How has public opinion become more fractured even as scientists have moved toward consensus ?\nViews of science play a role , as does the willingness to take an economic hit to affect the global temperature a degree or two . But Colorado shows how the divide on climate has become as tribal as politics itself .\nAmanda Paulson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 The community solar farm in Fort Collins is just one example of the way that city in Northern Colorado is taking a lead on climate change solutions . The city has reduced per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent since 2005 , and has a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 .\nIn Larimer , the Kellie Falbos look on climate change with a mounting sense of moral urgency , determined to save what they see as a planet in crisis . While in Weld , the Steve Wellses sigh at the headlong expansion of the federal government \u2013 from healthcare to Western land rights \u2013 and worry that climate change is just the next Trojan horse .\nIt \u2019 s not that there are no Americans in the middle . Far from it , actually , and there are efforts here and elsewhere to knit together the vast middle into a political force . Yet for the Americans driving the climate conversation , the issue has become a badge of belonging \u2013 a statement on which worldview they accept \u2013 as much as a matter of policy .\n\u201c If they understand the science or believe in the science , I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s super necessarily important , \u201d says Jack Zhou , a Duke University PhD who has surveyed climate attitudes . \u201c The facts of the matter matter a little less and some of the identity measures matter a little bit more . \u201d\nOn his ranch near Greeley , Mr. Wells sits inside his \u201c office , \u201d an enormous warehouse filled with hunting trophies , flags , eagle images , rodeo posters , and mementos : a 1927 green beer-delivery truck , a guitar signed by rock star and Second Amendment crusader Ted Nugent , and a \u2019 92 Harley Davidson low-rider in a glass case .\nHis understanding of the climate and of climate science comes from the numerous articles he reads every day , sifting through them \u201c to search for the truth . \u201d\nWhat strikes him as convincing ? Articles about emissions from Mt . St. Helens influencing climate more than humans ( a claim opposed by most scientists ) , and ones detailing NASA data showing the Antarctic ice cap is growing ( a paradox that scientists acknowledge , though most say it is insignificant in terms of broad warming trends ) .\nThe articles fit into a broader pattern of partisan distrust . He recounts what he sees as a litany of Democratic failures and distortions on energy and the environment .\n\u201c Jimmy Carter said we \u2019 d be out of oil by the year 2000 and we were headed for an ice age , and that didn \u2019 t pan out , \u201d Wells says . \u201c Then it was acid rain . Then we started the global warming thing , and now we \u2019 ve started on climate change . You need to follow the money to figure out the truth . If you look at Al Gore \u2019 s net worth since he got out of office versus now , he \u2019 s made a lot of money with this so-called energy issue . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not surprising to find such skepticism in Weld County , which is solidly Republican . Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions here can seem like a direct shot at a major source of its prosperity : Weld County has more oil and gas wells than any other Colorado county by a wide margin .\nIn a county with 63 people per square mile , no one is waiting for Google to move in . Ranching and farming and drilling are pretty much all Weld County has got .\nThat , and an independent streak . In 2013 , some of its county commissioners proposed a plan to secede from Colorado and \u2013 along with several other rural counties \u2013 form a new state .\nNot everyone in Weld County has oil-well income . The county is also home to some major manufacturing tied to solar and wind energy \u2013 renewable sources that are broadly popular in red and blue America alike .\nBut for residents like Roni Sylvester , owner of a Weld County farmhouse , climate change elicits only one response .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s a complete and total hoax , \u201d she says .\nIn one study he conducted , Mr. Zhou of Duke tested whether Republicans might show more support for curbing emissions if the rationale was couched in conservative ideals such as national security or safeguarding the economy . Instead , opposition to climate action actually hardened . It was seen as a liberal issue , period .\nMs. Sylvester has a website devoted to property-rights issues and is deeply angry about the many ways she sees environmental regulations infringing on those rights : through the Endangered Species Act , the creation of national monuments , and climate change .\nTo her , it \u2019 s the \u201c climate activists \u201d who have the science wrong and the \u201c climate realists \u201d like herself who are holding the line on bad policies , such as cap and trade , in which carbon emissions are limited but allowances can be traded among businesses .\n\u201c I see things like cap and trade as only a means to further enrich those who are trying to implement it , \u201d she says . \u201c The flip side is that I \u2019 m 1000 percent for research , and I really , really encourage and want research . But I want scientific , untainted by politics , research . \u201d\n\u201c First you say you can \u2019 t farm there , \u2018 You might hurt the sage grouse , which needs tall grass , and the piping plover needs short grass , \u2019 and then you deny [ farmers ] the opportunity to generate income and support their family , then you come along and say , \u2018 Oh , you can \u2019 t frack there either , \u2019 and it 's always based on emotion instead of solid science . \u201d\nAmanda Paulson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Roni Sylvester stands in front of several of the gas wells drilled on the 200-acre farm where she and her husband live in LaSalle , Colo . The farm has been in her husband 's family for four generations . Ms. Sylvester is a property-rights advocate who believes that climate change is a hoax , and is bothered by the many inroads into property rights that she says are caused by environmental legislation and activists .\nWhat seems most solid to Bill Jerke , who has lived his whole life on a 160-acre farm just south of Greeley , is that costs will go up if the climate activists get their way . Climate change is happening , he says , but wouldn \u2019 t it be better to adapt ?\n\u201c If we were to change our industrialized habits to the tune of being able to make a major impact , it would destroy civilization to a degree , \u201d says Mr. Jerke , who heads a local group that educates people about the benefits of the oil and gas industry . \u201c I happen to like A/C and being able to move around . I \u2019 m not going to turn all that off because someone thinks they might be able to change global warming to the tune of a degree or two over a century . \u201d\nHis view is telling . Even among Americans who believe in climate change , the willingness to pay to address it is all over the map .\n\u201c I think people might have a nominal , \u2018 Yeah , I want a cleaner environment , \u2019 \u201d says Zhou . \u201c But then when you push them on that or give them tradeoffs , then the environment does not fare well . \u201d\nAbout 42 percent say they wouldn \u2019 t pay even a dollar a month , according to a September poll conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . But 57 percent of respondents say they \u2019 d pay some monthly fee to curb emissions ( often $ 20 or $ 50 ) .\nShe founded a nonprofit to promote sustainable living , saying she saw a need for education about the individual actions people can take to live more sustainably .\n\u201c The people who hear about climate change and choose to ignore it \u2013 if we can reach 10 percent of those people who think they don \u2019 t make a difference , and show they can , that will have impact , \u201d Falbo says . \u201c It gets discouraging , but I \u2019 m hopeful . \u201d\nRaised to love the outdoors during her youth in Oregon , Falbo \u2019 s lifelong environmental ethic has guided her toward climate activism .\n\u201c It was always ingrained in me that you \u2019 ve got to take care of the Earth , and she \u2019 ll take care of you , \u201d she says .\nCross the county line from Weld County , and it \u2019 s not like you \u2019 ve entered Massachusetts . Larimer isn \u2019 t liberal in the way that , say , Boulder County , to its south , is . This is farm country , too .\nBut at the heart of Larimer County is Fort Collins , home of Colorado State University , and the city feels like a college town , from the funky cafes along Linden Street to the backpack-toting Millennials who use the county as their trailhead into the Rockies .\nOil and gas development is here , it just isn \u2019 t nearly as important .\nSo what emerges is a green tinge tempered by heartland pragmatism , with more carrots than sticks behind greenhouse-gas reductions .\nFort Collins has developed policies that have curbed per-capita emissions 18 percent since 2005 . By 2050 , the city aims to be carbon neutral . Voters even supported a five-year ban on fracking , but the state Supreme Court recently ruled it unconstitutional .\nFor many climate-change believers , concern about global warming has been growing in recent years as they \u2019 ve soaked up scientific reports about a melting Arctic .\nJackie Kozak Thiel , for one , has made climate change a personal priority for years . But fresh urgency came recently when she became a mother .\nFor her , and many others , that makes climate change action a moral calling .\n\u201c The intergenerational equity piece of sustainability has new meaning when you \u2019 re looking at someone you love so much , who will be your age when you meet these [ carbon ] goals , \u201d says Ms. Kozak Thiel , who is Fort Collins \u2019 s chief sustainability officer . \u201c That \u2019 s the city we want to deliver to her . And casting the compassionate net beyond your own blood , that \u2019 s the future you want to deliver to all young people . \u201d\nBack in Weld County , that idea resonates with Greeley Mayor Tom Norton , a Republican .\nFor more than a decade , he served in Colorado \u2019 s legislature , even spending time as president of the state senate , and he remembers thinking that legislators talking about climate change in the early 1990s were \u201c completely nuts . \u201d\n\u201c We need to think as long term as we can imagine , and be very thoughtful about what we leave for our children , \u201d he adds .\nHe \u2019 s hardly become a liberal climate crusader . A lot of his fellow Republicans \u2019 concerns about big government crushing small business still ring true to him .\nClimate change , he says , is \u201c something we need to deal with , and yes , we need to pay attention to it , but I \u2019 m such a property-rights and economic person that I think we have to pay a lot more attention to the cost to the general public of what we \u2019 re saying we need to do , and regulating people out of business is not the way to solve the problem . \u201d\nBut he thinks it 's time for politicians and others to start thinking about sustainability measures that make sense .\nThat puts him in America \u2019 s murky middle on climate change \u2013 believing in the problem but not energized about the most aggressive prescriptions .\n\u201c People toward the extremes are yelling louder , \u201d says Jon Krosnick , a Stanford University political scientist who studies climate attitudes . \u201c And also the Congress has become much more polarized in this way . \u201d\nThat dynamic is fed not just by politics , but also by the public \u2019 s limited bandwidth .\n\u201c The science and technology around climate change is pretty difficult to understand , \u201d says Professor Krosnick . \u201c And it \u2019 s hard enough in the political arena to get people to think about the things that are happening that affect them today . \u201d\nAmanda Paulson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Bill Jerke , standing on the Weld County farm that has been in his family since 1945 . Mr. Jerke , who directs a local group that educates people about the benefits of oil and gas , is n't concerned about climate change as an issue .\nIn Weld County , Carl Erickson is running for commissioner as a Democrat . He holds drastically different opinions about energy , fracking , and climate change than many of his neighbors do .\nSo he focuses on things they can agree on \u2013 the importance of oil and gas companies becoming more responsible with their well siting and technology , for instance , which he \u2019 s beginning to see some companies do , or focusing on issues of air quality and water , things most people in a rural area can agree are important .\n\u201c There are the polarized groups that are going further away , but there \u2019 s a vast majority in the center that are starting to actually listen and think and that \u2019 s the group we really have to [ engage ] , \u201d Mr. Erickson says .\nMeanwhile in Larimer County , George Wallace sees the issue from a global as well as local perspective .\nA retired natural-resources professor , Mr. Wallace is now an organic-farm owner surrounded by conservative neighbors . Mostly , he doesn \u2019 t engage on political issues with them , outside of some lighthearted teasing .\nBut he laments the degree to which America has become isolated into what he calls \u201c tribal information sources , \u201d leaving less civility , discourse , and willingness to engage respectfully . Still , he \u2019 s determined not to give up .\n\u201c We live well , and it \u2019 s real easy to say , \u2018 Don \u2019 t worry about it \u2019 \u2013 not to attempt personal lifestyle changes very much , \u201d he says . \u201c But I know [ we \u2019 ll ] be faced with enormous challenges . Water \u2019 s going to be one of them , and food . I can \u2019 t help but look at it beyond just my own family . Worldwide we \u2019 ll have some huge challenges . \u201d\nSo , like Falbo , Wallace looks for small ways he and his wife can help : serving actively in civic groups , driving a Toyota Prius when they go to town , not using commercial fertilizer or pesticides , which require energy to produce .\nThe partner with whom he trains park rangers on mules and horses in the backcountry is far to the right . So Wallace manages to find small areas of overlap where they can talk about issues like climate change .\n\u201c One way we can talk about it is the forests , \u201d he says . \u201c I take the things that are right in front of us , forest health and snowpack and runoff , and we can talk about that . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

And casting the compassionate net beyond your own blood, that\u2019s the future you want to deliver to all young people.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBack in Weld County, that idea resonates with Greeley Mayor Tom Norton, a Republican.\n\nFor more than a decade, he served in Colorado\u2019s legislature, even spending time as president of the state senate, and he remembers thinking that legislators talking about climate change in the early 1990s were \u201ccompletely nuts.\u201d\n\nBut now, he says, \u201cmy opinion has changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to think as long term as we can imagine, and be very thoughtful about what we leave for our children,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe\u2019s hardly become a liberal climate crusader. A lot of his fellow Republicans\u2019 concerns about big government crushing small business still ring true to him.\n\nClimate change, he says, is \u201csomething we need to deal with, and yes, we need to pay attention to it, but I\u2019m such a property-rights and economic person that I think we have to pay a lot more attention to the cost to the general public of what we\u2019re saying we need to do, and regulating people out of business is not the way to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nBut he thinks it's time for politicians and others to start thinking about sustainability measures that make sense.\n\nThat puts him in America\u2019s murky middle on climate change \u2013 believing in the problem but not energized about the most aggressive prescriptions.\n\n\u201cPeople toward the extremes are yelling louder,\u201d says Jon Krosnick, a Stanford University political scientist who studies climate attitudes. \u201cAnd also the Congress has become much more polarized in this way.\u201d\n\nThat dynamic is fed not just by politics, but also by the public\u2019s limited bandwidth.\n\n\u201cThe science and technology around climate change is pretty difficult to understand,\u201d says Professor Krosnick. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard enough in the political arena to get people to think about the things that are happening that affect them today.\u201d\n\nBut there is opportunity for common ground.\n\nAmanda Paulson/The Christian Science Monitor Bill Jerke, standing on the Weld County farm that has been in his family since 1945. Mr. Jerke, who directs a local group that educates people about the benefits of oil and gas, isn't concerned about climate change as an issue.\n\nIn Weld County, Carl Erickson is running for commissioner as a Democrat. He holds drastically different opinions about energy, fracking, and climate change than many of his neighbors do.\n\nSo he focuses on things they can agree on \u2013 the importance of oil and gas companies becoming more responsible with their well siting and technology, for instance, which he\u2019s beginning to see some companies do, or focusing on issues of air quality and water, things most people in a rural area can agree are important.\n\n\u201cThere are the polarized groups that are going further away, but there\u2019s a vast majority in the center that are starting to actually listen and think and that\u2019s the group we really have to [engage],\u201d Mr. Erickson says.\n\nMeanwhile in Larimer County, George Wallace sees the issue from a global as well as local perspective.\n\nA retired natural-resources professor, Mr. Wallace is now an organic-farm owner surrounded by conservative neighbors. Mostly, he doesn\u2019t engage on political issues with them, outside of some lighthearted teasing.\n\nBut he laments the degree to which America has become isolated into what he calls \u201ctribal information sources,\u201d leaving less civility, discourse, and willingness to engage respectfully. Still, he\u2019s determined not to give up.\n\n\u201cWe live well, and it\u2019s real easy to say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it\u2019 \u2013 not to attempt personal lifestyle changes very much,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I know [we\u2019ll] be faced with enormous challenges. Water\u2019s going to be one of them, and food. I can\u2019t help but look at it beyond just my own family. Worldwide we\u2019ll have some huge challenges.\u201d\n\nSo, like Falbo, Wallace looks for small ways he and his wife can help: serving actively in civic groups, driving a Toyota Prius when they go to town, not using commercial fertilizer or pesticides, which require energy to produce.\n\nAnd he looks for ways to build bridges.\n\nThe partner with whom he trains park rangers on mules and horses in the backcountry is far to the right. So Wallace manages to find small areas of overlap where they can talk about issues like climate change.\n\n\u201cOne way we can talk about it is the forests,\u201d he says. \u201cI take the things that are right in front of us, forest health and snowpack and runoff, and we can talk about that.\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
