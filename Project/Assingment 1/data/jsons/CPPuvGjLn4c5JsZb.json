    "content": "The Trump administration 's Ambassador to the European Union , Gordon Sondland , appeared before the House Intelligence Committee 's impeachment panel yesterday , and his testimony was very significant . In my view , it confirmed myriad abuses of power and unethical conduct by the president and his team vis-a-vis Ukraine , including the establishment of an explicit quid pro quo . It also , however , handed President Trump and his defenders a number of potent talking points that cut against the impeachment and removal narrative . In his opening statement , Sondland confirmed that he and many others were `` in the loop '' on an arrangement in which the Ukrainian government was to announce the launch of investigations into Kiev 's 2016 interference in the American election , as well as Burisma and the Bidens .\nI 've argued previously that the former subject , despite some of its adjacent conspiracies , is a legitimate bone of contention for Trump ; the latter demand , by contrast , was a clear misuse of power . Especially telling was the insistence , as relayed by Sondland , that the desired probes merely be announced publicly , as opposed to actually undertaken . Here is the key quote , followed by the most plausible interpretation of what it demonstrates :\n`` He had to announce the investigations . He did n't actually have to do them , as I understood it . '' - Sondland .\nThis is key . It was never about corruption . It was about tarring a domestic political opponent . \u2014 Noah Rothman ( @ NoahCRothman ) November 20 , 2019\nI can easily be convinced that President Trump held a grudge against Kiev over the previous government 's assistance to the Democrats during the last campaign . I can not be convinced that Trump is fundamentally offended by corruption in an Eastern European country . The most obvious reason Trump kept pushing for the Burisma probe announcement was that it would present a political problem back home for Joe Biden , his strongest on-paper 2020 opponent ( who is , in fact , taking a hit on the Ukraine matter , as it happens ) . But whereas Sondland unequivocally testified to a quid pro quo in which a White House meeting for Zelensky was the reward for the investigations ( bad , but not impeachable ) , he did not testify that he had hard or firsthand evidence of such an arrangement involving a military aid package approved by Congress and destined for Ukraine ( far more serious ) . We know that the president put a hold on said aid , over the objections of his entire national security team , for reasons that remain unclear . It is entirely conceivable , if not likely , that this pause was tied into Trump 's fixation on the `` deliverable '' of investigations being announced . But on the question of whether Trump himself ever linked those investigations with the military aid , Sondland said no :\nDemocrats love citing random conversations between random bureaucrats , but here 's a direct quote from the actual President they absolutely refuse to acknowledge .\nSondland quoting Trump : `` I want nothing .
