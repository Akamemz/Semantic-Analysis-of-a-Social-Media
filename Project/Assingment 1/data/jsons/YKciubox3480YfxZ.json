D-Day -- Donald Day -- is upon us and more than any other previous election cycle , it looks like Donald Trump might actually bestow upon us the comedy gift that 'll keep on giving for a way-too-brief six-to-eight months .\nAccording to The Washington Post , Trump is `` likely '' to announce his entry into the campaign for the 2016 Republican Party presidential nomination . One of the Post 's leading indicators is that Trump plans to publish a two-page financial document summarizing his $ 9 billion net worth immediately following his speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan ( here 's to hoping it 's outdoors , on the roof , and really windy ) .\nAll that said , it 's entirely possible this is another Trump bait-and-switch publicity stunt . You might recall how he teased a possible presidential run for the 2012 GOP nomination . At one point , Trump quizzed his contestants on Celebrity Apprentice , asking Meat Loaf if he thought Trump should run , to which Meat Loaf replied with an enthusiastic , `` Absolutely ! '' By the way , that was a feature of the presidential election four years ago -- asking Meat Loaf for political advice -- and it 's actually grown far worse in the last four years . Indeed , today , if Meat Loaf himself decided to run as a Republican , he 'd probably poll better than half the field .\nWith Trump officially joining the race , he vindicates the increasingly obvious analysis that the Republican Party , at the presidential level at least , is little more than a shell corporation for opportunists and careerists who are n't interested in governing or even winning . The addition of Trump is the would-be final brick in the effort to turn the GOP 's nominating process into a dysfunctional and menacingly ugly reality show competition in which the contestants each scramble to be the most flagrant panderer to the Tea Party base and , subsequently , augment their Q-scores within the lucrative conservative entertainment complex . That 's the real prize , and Trump , above all the others , is aiming to scoop up as much of that as he can . He wo n't win the nomination , but that 's not his goal , nor is it the goal of most of the field . The real race is for celebrity heft .\nAccording to RealClearPolitics , Trump is polling somewhere close to the middle of the field at around 3.6 percent . The fact that he 's ahead of Rick Perry , Rick Santorum , Carly Fiorina , Lindsey Graham , Bobby Jindal , and Ohio Gov . John Kasich speaks volumes about where Republican voters are right now . Specifically , they 're not completely ashamed to support a billionaire doofus like Trump . But they should be . ( Perhaps we should ask Meat Loaf if he 's not too ashamed to support Trump . ) It ought to be obvious to anyone paying attention that when Trump says he has a `` secret plan '' to defeat ISIS , but wo n't reveal it until he 's president , there 's clearly no plan and he 's making it up . If he really had a plan , he 'd at least talk about the bullet points to , at the very least , do his part to prevent another beheading . But he 'll just wait until Inauguration Day , 2017 , two years from now to spill the beans about his secret ISIS plan . He 's quite the humanitarian .\nThe fact of the matter is that Trump is a circus sideshow attraction who 's incongruously being regarded as a somewhat serious contender , at least according to the polls . If the first debate were to be held tomorrow , Trump would be one of the top-tier candidates invited to participate . Again , fantastic for those of us who make a living tearing down cartoon characters like Trump , but it 's really bad news for American politics .\nIf the Republican Party truly believes that there 's a serious set of crises facing America , and that they must be resolved or else , the party surely is n't telegraphing to the world that it 's interested in fielding candidates who are commensurate with the seriousness of the nation 's perils . Indeed , it 's exactly the opposite . The more the GOP screeches about how disastrous the Obama presidency has been -- deliberately killing babies , leading from behind , destroying jobs and leading us to the brink of a socialist dystopia ( no matter that none of that is true ) -- then name one serious GOP candidate who can do something to ameliorate all that . It 's definitely not Trump , who 's nothing more than a blowhard reality show hack who lucked and scammed his way into fame and fortune .",
