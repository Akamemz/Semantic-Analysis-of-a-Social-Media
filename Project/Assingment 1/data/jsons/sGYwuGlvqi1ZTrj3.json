    "content": "The White House outlined in a defiant eight-page letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democrats on Tuesday why it will not participate in their \u201c illegitimate and unconstitutional \u201d impeachment inquiry , charging that the proceedings have run roughshod over congressional norms and the president 's due-process rights .\nTrump administration officials called the letter , which was written by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and obtained by Fox News , perhaps the most historic letter the White House has sent . The document tees up a head-on collision with Democrats in Congress , who have fired off a slew of subpoenas in recent days concerning the president 's alleged effort to get Ukraine to investigate political foe Joe Biden during a July phone call with Ukraine 's leader .\n`` President Trump and his administration reject your baseless , unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process , '' the letter stated . `` Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice . In order to fulfill his duties to the American people , the Constitution , the Executive Branch , and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency , President Trump and his administration can not participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances . ''\nThe document concluded : `` The president has a country to lead . The American people elected him to do this job , and he remains focused on fulfilling his promises to the American people . ''\nResponding to the letter , Pelosi accused Trump of `` trying to make lawlessness a virtue '' and added , `` The American people have already heard the President \u2019 s own words \u2013 \u2018 do us a favor , though. \u2019 '' ( That line , from a transcript of Trump 's call with Ukraine 's leader , in reality referred to Trump 's request for Ukraine to assist in an investigation into 2016 election interference , and did not relate to Biden . )\nPelosi continued : `` This letter is manifestly wrong , and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration \u2019 s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections . ... The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President \u2019 s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction . Mr. President , you are not above the law . You will be held accountable . \u201d\nSubstantively , the White House first noted in its letter that there has not been a formal vote in the House to open an impeachment inquiry -- and that the news conference held by Pelosi last month was insufficient to commence the proceedings .\n`` In the history of our nation , the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step , '' the letter stated .\nIt continued : `` Without waiting to see what was actually said on the call , a press conference was held announcing an 'impeachment inquiry ' based on falsehoods and misinformation about the call . ''\nSCHIFF SAYS 'WE ' DID N'T TALK TO WHISTLEBLOWER -- THEN BACKTRACKS\nDespite Pelosi 's claim that there was no \u201c House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry , \u201d several previous impeachment inquiries have been launched only by a full vote of the House -- including the impeachment proceedings concerning former Presidents Andrew Johnson , Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton .\nWhite House officials told Fox News the vote opening the proceedings was a small ask , considering the implications of potentially overturning a national election .\nHouse rules do not require a vote to begin an impeachment inquiry , but it remains unclear whether the courts will agree that an impeachment inquiry has begun without such a vote . If courts do not find that a formal inquiry is in progress , they could curtail Democrats ' evidence-gathering efforts .\nThe letter went on to note that `` information has recently come to light that the whistleblower '' who first flagged Trump 's call with Ukraine 's president `` had contact with [ House Intelligence Committee ] Chairman [ Adam ] Schiff 's office before filing the complaint . ''\nAnd Schiff 's `` initial denial of such contact caused The Washington Post to conclude that Chairman Schiff `` clearly made a statement that was false , '' the letter observed .\nMultiple reports surfaced this week that the whistleblower had a prior `` professional relationship '' with one of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president . On Friday , lawyers for the whistleblower did not respond to questions from Fox News about the whistleblower 's possible previous relationship with any currently prominent Democrat .\nThe letter added : `` In any event , the American people understand that Chairman Schiff can not covertly assist with the submission of a complaint , mislead the public about his involvement , read a counterfeit version of the call to the American people , and then pretend to sit in judgment as a neutral 'investigator . ' ''\nThe White House was dinging Schiff for reciting a fictional version of Trump 's call with Ukraine 's leader during a congressional hearing . Schiff later called his statements a `` parody . ''\n`` Perhaps the best evidence that there was no wrongdoing on the call is the fact that , after the actual record of the call was released , Chairman Schiff chose to concoct a false version of the call and to read his made-up transcript to the American people at a public hearing , '' the letter stated . `` The chairman 's action only further undermines the public 's confidence in the fairness of any inquiry before his committee . ''\nUkraine 's president has said he felt Trump did nothing improper in their July call , and DOJ lawyers who reviewed the call said they found no laws had been broken . The White House released a transcript of the conversation last month , as well as the whistleblower 's complaint , which seemingly relied entirely on second-hand information .\nSeparately , the letter asserted multiple alleged violations of the president 's due-process rights . It noted that under current impeachment inquiry proceedings , Democrats were not allowing presidential or State Department counsel to be present .\nDemocrats ' procedures did not provide for the `` disclosure of all evidence favorable to the president and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry , '' the letter noted , nor did the procedures afford the president `` the right to see all evidence , to present evidence , to call witnesses , to have counsel present at all hearings , to cross-examine all witnesses , to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence , and to respond to evidence and testimony . ''\nDemocrats also have not permitted Republicans in the minority to issue subpoenas , contradicting the `` standard , bipartisan practice in all recent resolutions authorizing presidential impeachment inquiries . ''\n`` President Trump and his Administration can not participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances . '' \u2014 Pat Cipollone , counsel to President Trump\nThe letter claimed that House committees have `` resorted to threats and intimidation against potential Executive Branch witnesses , '' by raising the specter of obstruction of justice when administration employees seek to assert `` long-established Executive Branch confidentiality interests and privileges in response to a request for a deposition . ''\n`` Current and former State Department officials are duty bound to protect the confidentiality interests of the Executive Branch , and the Office of Legal Counsel has also recognized that it is unconstitutional to exclude agency counsel from participating in congressional depositions , '' the letter stated .\nEXCLUSIVE : WHISTLEBLOWER WRITES WH OFFICIAL DESCRIBED TRUMP CALL AS 'FRIGHTENING '\nAdditionally , the letter noted that Democrats reportedly were planning to interview the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment inquiry at an undisclosed location -- contrary , the White House said , to the constitutional notion of being able to confront one 's accuser .\nAccording to a White House official , the bottom line was : `` We are not participating in your illegitimate exercise . ... If you are legitimately conducting oversight , let us know . But all indications are this is about impeachment . ''\nThe document came as the White House aggressively has parried Democrats ' inquiry efforts . One of the administration 's first moves : the State Department on Tuesday barred Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , from appearing before a House panel conducting the probe into Trump .\nGOP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION TO KICK PELOSI OUT OF THE HOUSE\n`` I would love to send Ambassador Sondland , a really good man and great American , to testify , but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court , where Republican 's rights have been taken away , and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see , '' Trump tweeted .\nTHE LATEST REPORTING FROM FOX NEWS IN THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND UKRAINE CONTROVERSY\nThe strategy risked further provoking Democrats in the impeachment probe , setting up court challenges and the potential for lawmakers to draw up an article of impeachment accusing Trump of obstructing their investigations . Schiff said Sondland 's no-show would be grounds for obstruction of justice and could give a preview of what some of the articles of impeachment against Trump would entail .\nBut , as lawmakers sought to amass ammunition to be used in an impeachment trial , the White House increasingly has signaled that all-out warfare was its best course of action .\n`` What they did to this country is unthinkable . It 's lucky that I 'm the president . A lot of people said very few people could handle it . I sort of thrive on it , '' Trump said Monday at the White House . `` You ca n't impeach a president for doing a great job . This is a scam . ''\nHouse Democrats , for their part , issued a new round of subpoenas on Monday , this time to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and acting White House budget director Russell Vought . Pelosi 's office also released an open letter signed by 90 former national security officials who served in administrations from both parties , voicing support for the whistleblower who raised concerns about Trump 's efforts to get Ukraine to look into Biden 's business dealings in Ukraine .\n`` A responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed , thus advancing the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers , '' they wrote . `` Whatever one 's view of the matters discussed in the whistleblower 's complaint , all Americans should be united in demanding that all branches of our government and all outlets of our media protect this whistleblower and his or her identity .
