Senator McGovern , a liberal who opposed the war in Vietnam , drew large and enthusiastic crowds on the campaign trail but went on to lose every state save Massachusetts and the District of Columbia to an unpopular incumbent .\nToday , Mr. Matz finds himself watching the campaign of Vermont Sen.

At the final debate in Des Moines last week , Mr. Sanders was given one of the center-stage spots reserved for front-runners .\nHe \u2019 s benefitted in part from the struggles of fellow progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren , whose support appears to have fallen off in recent weeks \u2013 and with whom he had a public spat last week over whether or not he once told her he believed a woman could not win the White House .\nMr. Sanders \u2019 strength is eliciting a kind of anxiety within certain quarters of the Democratic Party not unlike the reaction many Republicans had four years ago to another party outsider who few initially believed could win : Donald Trump . Like President Trump , Mr. Sanders \u2019 unconventional style and promise to upend Washington has attracted a passionate group of followers who can \u2019 t be neatly categorized \u2013 and could wind up scrambling the usual \u201c rules \u201d of politics .\n\u201c The ironic similarity between Bernie and Trump is that they both have clear messages , \u201d says Iowa-based Democratic strategist Jeff Link . \u201c [ Bernie ] is incredibly clear and consistent and authentic \u2026 and that is powerful in a time when people are cynical about politicians . \u201d\nA lot can change in the weeks leading up to Iowa \u2013 and frequently does .

The latest poll out of California , which will vote on Super Tuesday , has Mr. Sanders in the lead there .\n\u201c The realization that his campaign is viable enough to win multiple early states , and with the funding there as well , has awoken many to the possibility that he could win the nomination , \u201d says Scott Mulhauser , a longtime Democratic operative who was Vice President Joe Biden \u2019 s deputy chief of staff during the 2012 Obama-Biden reelection campaign . \u201c There is a steadiness to his campaign that has endured despite seemingly everything . \u201d\nShannon Stapleton/Reuters A supporter of Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders stands during a campaign event in Des Moines , Iowa , on Jan. 20 , 2020 . Many Iowa voters remain undecided , heading into the state 's Feb. 3 caucuses .\nLately , the drumbeat from establishment Democrats warning against a Sanders nomination has grown noticeably louder .\nHillary Clinton made headlines Tuesday for speaking out against her 2016 primary rival . \u201c Nobody likes him , nobody wants to work with him , he got nothing done , \u201d she says in a forthcoming documentary \u2013 an assessment she repeated in an interview in The Hollywood Reporter .

To beat Mr. Trump in November , they say , the Democratic nominee will need to excite new voters and get them to the polls \u2013 voters who , like many of Mr. Trump \u2019 s supporters , have been disappointed by the party and are unhappy with the status quo . Some hypothetical general election matchups do show Mr. Sanders , along with Mr. Biden , faring best against Mr. Trump . One poll published last week by Marquette University Law School found they were the only two to beat Mr. Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin .\nBut while Mr. Sanders \u2019 supporters see the passion he inspires as a strength , other Democrats see it as a threat . Many blame Mr. Sanders for Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s general election loss in 2016 , and fear that if he fails to win the nomination again in 2020 , his supporters will stay home on Nov. 3 instead of rallying around the party \u2019 s nominee .\n\u201c Sanders concerns Democrats by getting the nomination \u2013 and by not getting the nomination , \u201d says Dennis Goldford , a political scientist at Drake University in Des Moines , Iowa . \u201c Democrats are scared down to their toes that Sanders could tank the whole ticket . \u201d\nOf course , not everyone is convinced that Mr. Sanders has a real shot at clinching the nomination .

And he would be underestimated only if he breaks that solid ceiling this time around . \u201d\nSome activists on the ground in Iowa express skepticism about Mr. Sanders \u2019 strength .

True , Mr. Sanders surprised everyone with his near-win against Mrs. Clinton in 2016 , says Mr. Welch \u2013 but it would be shocking for him to rise to the top again this year with such a \u201c thick bench \u201d of Democratic candidates .\nJulie Geopfert , chair of the neighboring Webster County Democrats , says Mr. Sanders \u2019 supporters don \u2019 t seem as \u201c fanatical \u201d this time around . In fact , she says she has seen a lot of Sanders backers from 2016 switch over to other candidates this cycle .\nBut the bigger field could actually be helpful to Mr. Sanders . Like Mr. Trump , he may benefit from a large and fractured primary , in which those opposed to him wind up splitting their support among various other candidates , and the percentage any one candidate needs to win is lower .\nIn a January 2016 Des Moines Register poll , 43 % of likely caucusgoers said they would describe themselves as \u201c socialist , \u201d which ended up being a good proxy for Mr. Sanders \u2019 eventual support in the caucus that year . In this year \u2019 s poll , only 28 % of likely caucusgoers described themselves that way . At first glance , that may seem like disappointing news for Mr. Sanders . But that also might be all he needs to win .\n\u201c The campaign has thought all along that if they can maintain their base and there is a credible challenger to Biden in the establishment lane , then they would be in good shape , \u201d says Mr. Link .\nThe way the Iowa caucuses work could benefit Mr. Sanders even more . If candidates are deemed \u201c nonviable \u201d on caucus night ( meaning they have the support of less than 15 % of those in the room ) , then their supporters can \u201c realign \u201d with a different candidate .\nKelcey Brackett , chair of the Muscatine County Democrats , speculates that two candidates who may wind up as nonviable are Hawaii Rep.
