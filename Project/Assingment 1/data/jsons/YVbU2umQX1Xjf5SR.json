    "content": "After eight years of a president with a short legislative resume , Rick Perry says Americans will not make that same mistake in 2016 and are ready for a president with a proven record of accomplishment . `` We took a chance with a young , articulate United States senator who did n't have any record , and I happen to think we 're paying a price for it , '' the former Texas governor told an audience in New Hampshire last week . `` Americans are going to want someone who has been tested , someone who 's got results in their background , and we 're not going to choose another young , untested United States senator , '' Perry asserted recently , according to the Dallas Morning News `` So whether it 's on job creation or public safety or public health , I think Americans are going to want to see someone who has that experience , '' the former governor added.Perry is not the only one arguing that what is needed to fix the nation 's problems is executive experience.During a recent visit to Washington for a series of meetings , Indiana Gov . Mike Pence said that the `` cure '' for the nation 's ills will come from the state capitals . `` I would say , with the deepest respect to my former colleagues , that I am persuaded , having spent 12 years in Congress and two years as a governor , that the cure for what ails this country will come as much from our nation 's state capitals as it ever will from our nation 's capital , '' Pence told the House Committee on Education and the Workforce , according to The Daily Jeffersonian Pence and Perry 's focus on their executive experience is a wise campaign strategy if recent history is a guide . Of the last six individuals elected president , Jimmy Carter , Ronald Reagan , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were all governors.Currently , there are as many as 10 sitting or former governors from both parties considering a campaign for president , according to The Washington Post 's Reid Wilson.While leading a state can have its advantages , it also has its downside , Wilson says . `` Without exception , their records give them something to run on \u2014 and their opponents something to run against . Opposition researchers are salivating at the opportunity to highlight the inevitable flubs , foibles and failings that any governor faces , '' he writes.Particularly for the Republican governors pondering a run in 2016 , how they have or have not implemented Obamacare may or may not be a strength.For example , New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie temporarily expanded Medicaid in 2013 , while Ohio Gov . John Kasich unilaterally expanded the program in his state a year later and just last month , Pence approved an alternative to Medicaid expansion last month , according to the Post.The strength of their records , however , does not necessarily translate into success once in office . 2012 paper authored by University of Miami political scientists Joseph Uscinski and Arthur Simon found that military experience was a better predictor of success as a president and that whether the individual is from a large or a small state was a factor . `` In stark contrast to previous studies , we show that certain experiences are potent , but also nuanced , predictors of presidential performance . The strongest predictors of success across specification include certain forms of military service and service as a governor of a big state . These findings support a president-centered approach : factors internal to the individual president appear to affect performance , '' they wrote.Perry has both executive and military experience , which sets him apart from the GOP field.Not surprisingly , those candidates who lack executive experience disagree . `` The next president of the United States needs to be someone that has a clear view of what 's happening in the world , a clear strategic vision of America 's role in it , and a clear tactical plan for how to engage America in global affairs . And I think for governors , that 's going to be a challenge at least initially , because they do n't deal with foreign policy on a daily basis , '' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told the editorial board of The Christian Science Monitor in January .",
