It is defined by the law as detestable. \u201d During a debate in September 2017 , he went out of his way to bemoan the fact that \u201c sodomy [ and ] sexual perversion sweep the land \u201d . September 11 attacks as divine punishment In a speech in February , Moore appeared to suggest that the terrorist attacks of September 11 were the result of divine retribution against the United States and prophesized in the Book of Isaiah . In comments first reported by CNN , Moore quoted Isaiah 30:12-13 , saying : \u201c Because you have despised His word and trust in perverseness and oppression , and say thereon ... therefore this iniquity will be to you as a breach ready to fall , swell out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instance. \u201d Moore then noted : \u201c Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon , whose breaking came suddenly at an instance , doesn \u2019 t it ? \u201d He added : \u201c If you think that \u2019 s coincidence , if you go to verse 25 : \u2018 There should be up on every high mountain and upon every hill , rivers and streams of water in the day of the great slaughter when the towers will fall. \u2019 '' Praise for Putin In an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 in August , Moore praised Putin for his views on gay rights . \u201c Maybe Putin is right .

Moore specifically named gay marriage as one of those \u201c bad things \u201d .\n'Reds and yellows \u2019 At a rally earlier in September , Moore talked about \u201c reds and yellows fighting \u201d while discussing racial division in the United States . Moore justified this on Twitter by citing lyrics from the song Jesus Loves the Little Children . He wrote \u201c Red , yellow , black and white they are precious in His sight . Jesus loves the little children of the world . This is the Gospel. \u201d Tracking livestock is communism In 2006 , Moore condemned a proposal for a national ID system for animals as \u201c more identifiable with communism than free enterprise \u201d . The proposal received attention after a cow in Alabama had been diagnosed with mad cow disease . Moore , who was then running for governor , was skeptical that the outbreak was real .

We have redefined marriage and destroyed the basis of family , which is the building block of our country . \u201d\nHe continued to rail against a litany of other issues , including transgender rights ( \u201c We have even begun to recognize the right of a man to claim to be a woman , and vice versa \u201d ) , the economy and campaign finance .\nMoore has long complained about these issues and was one of the most prominent opponents to same-sex marriage in the lead-up to its legalization . Prior to that , he attracted nationwide attention in a battle to keep a statue of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of Alabama \u2019 s supreme court when he was its chief justice .\nHis defeat on Tuesday followed accusations by two women who said he assaulted them when they were teenagers . Their claims were followed by allegations from other women who said Moore had romantically pursued them when they were underage .
