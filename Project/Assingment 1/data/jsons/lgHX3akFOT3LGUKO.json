    "content": "One of President Donald Trump \u2019 s most controversial judicial nominees will have to start the nomination process all over again next year .\nPolitico reported Friday that some 100 presidential nominees have been declined by the Senate and sent back to the White House . That includes Thomas Farr , a North Carolina attorney who has defended the state from allegations of suppressing the black vote . If the president hopes to continue with these nominations , the administration will have to renominate these figures next year .\nFarr was nominated in July to the Eastern District of North Carolina \u2019 s federal court , a district that includes a portion of the Southern \u201c Black Belt \u201d ( roughly 27 percent of the region \u2019 s residents are black ) . In October , Farr cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and was expected to go before the Senate for a final vote in the near future .\nBut the Senate , possibly due to a push from Democrats , has blocked several of Trump \u2019 s nominees from advancing to a full vote before the new year . That means the nomination process ( with committee hearings and all ) will have to start anew for this group , and Farr will have to face new questions about his past that have come up in the intervening months .\nMany of Trump \u2019 s judicial nominees have proven controversial , but Farr \u2019 s nomination has stood out for his defense of a number of North Carolina \u2019 s most controversial voting-related measures , including its gerrymandered district maps that were partially struck down for packing minority voters into a small number of districts .\nFarr is perhaps better known for providing the legal defense of North Carolina \u2019 s voter ID law , which was blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in 2016 . In its ruling , the court noted that the law targeted North Carolina \u2019 s African Americans \u201c with almost surgical precision , \u201d adding that it might have been \u201c the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim Crow . \u201d\nFarr \u2019 s nomination , introduced by a president who alleges that voter fraud cost him the popular vote , and coming a few years after the gutting of the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court , angered civil rights groups .\nThe North Carolina NAACP argued that Farr \u201c has been the lead attorney in attacking every modern effort in North Carolina to empower the state \u2019 s African-American voters ; and in most of case , he has been a public architect of the regressive and discriminatory backlash. \u201d In a letter to members of the Senate , Vanita Gupta , president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , and a former head of the Justice Department \u2019 s Civil Rights Division during the Obama administration , argued that \u201c Mr . Farr \u2019 s nomination appears to be part of an overall campaign by the Trump administration to suppress voting rights in America . \u201d\nFarr has also been criticized for his involvement with the 1990 reelection campaign of then-Sen. Jesse Helms , long recognized as an ardent segregationist . As Mother Jones \u2019 s Ari Berman noted prior to Farr \u2019 s confirmation vote in the Senate :\nFarr served as Helms \u2019 campaign lawyer during his Senate runs in 1984 and 1990 , two of the most notoriously racist campaigns in modern American history . In 1990 , when Helms faced off against former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt , the city \u2019 s first black mayor , the North Carolina Republican Party sent 125,000 postcards to predominantly African American households falsely telling them it was a crime to vote if they \u2019 d moved within 30 days of the election , with a punishment of \u201c up to five years in jail . \u201d\nWhen asked about his connections to the postcards during his October confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Farr denied having any involvement , saying that he was only made aware of the issue when the Department of Justice sued the Helms campaign over the scheme .
