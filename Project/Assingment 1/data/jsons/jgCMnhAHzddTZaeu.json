    "content": "Back in 2011 , while covering Occupy Wall Street , I was accosted by a man wearing a large cardboard box . On this box , which he wore around his torso as might a child pretending to be a robot , he had scribbled down a theory that , at first glance , seemed more sophisticated than most that were on display . \u201c Hey , man , \u201d he said to me , \u201c it \u2019 s up to us . \u201d\nTo explain , he turned around to reveal the other side of the box , which bore a single word : democracy . Then , having paused for effect , he turned around again and pointed to the front , on which he had written down almost every single economic system that had been tried in human history : capitalism , socialism , mercantilism , autarky , distributism , fascism , feudalism , potlatch , mutualism , and so forth . \u201c It \u2019 s up to us , \u201d he said again . \u201c It \u2019 s our democracy , and we can choose the economy we want . \u201d\nFurther conversation revealed that he believed this quite literally . In his view , democracy was the sole nonnegotiable element of our political system , while everything else was up for grabs . If a majority wanted to nationalize the banks or abolish private property or bar all international trade or invade Brazil and harvest its resources , that was its prerogative . As might be expected , he had a prediction and a predilection : Socialism , he explained , was both the most likely system to be adopted , because it catered to the \u201c majority , not the 1 percent , \u201d and the best , because it would fix all of America \u2019 s problems without any downsides .\nI have thought about this conversation frequently since then , because it highlights some of the core misconceptions held by socialism \u2019 s champions , which are , in no particular order , that the retention of a democratic system of government makes massive state intervention more acceptable , that \u201c capitalism \u201d is a \u201c system \u201d in the same way as is \u201c socialism , \u201d and that liberal democracy \u2014 and , in particular , America \u2019 s brilliant constitutional order \u2014 can survive the establishment of a socialist economy . Because I was there to write about the protests rather than to get into prolonged arguments , I listened and probed rather than disputed his contention . Had I been debating him , however , my rejoinder would have been a simple one : No , it \u2019 s not \u201c up to us . \u201d\nOr , at least , it \u2019 s not up to \u201c us \u201d in the way that my friend in the cardboard box was using the word \u201c us. \u201d As I write , ascendant elements within the American Left are engaged in a sustained attempt to reintroduce and rehabilitate the word \u201c socialism , \u201d in part by prepending to it a word that has a much better reputation and an infinitely better historical record : \u201c democratic. \u201d Voters should not be fooled by the rebranding , for there is no sense in which socialism can be made compatible with democracy as it is understood in the West . At worst , socialism eats democracy and is swiftly transmuted into tyranny and deprivation . At best \u2014 and I use that word loosely \u2014 socialism stamps out individual agency , places civil society into a straitjacket of uniform size , and turns representative government into a chimera . The U.S. Constitution may as a technical matter be silent on most economic questions , but it is crystal clear on the appropriate role of government . And the government that it permits is incompatible with , and insufficient to sustain , socialism .\nThis is deliberate . In the United States , and beyond , we do not think about our democracy in purely procedural terms . While majority rule on certain political questions is indeed deemed imperative , we nevertheless reject the notion that majorities may do whatever they wish , we demand that our institutions leave room for civil society and for individuals , and we insist upon a broad presumption of liberty that extends across all areas of human activity . It is reasonably well understood in this country that to place the word \u201c democratic \u201d in front of , say , \u201c speech restrictions \u201d or \u201c warrantless searches \u201d or \u201c juryless criminal prosecutions \u201d would be in no way to legitimize those things or to make them more compatible with the preservation of a free society .\nIt is less well understood that to place the word \u201c democratic \u201d in front of \u201c socialism \u201d is an equally fruitless endeavor \u2014 and for the same reasons . To those whose conception of \u201c democracy \u201d is limited entirely to the question of \u201c Who won the most votes ? \u201d this may seem paradoxical . To those familiar with the precepts beneath the Anglo-American tradition , however , it should be quite obvious . Just as the individual right to free speech is widely comprehended as part of what we mean by \u201c democracy \u201d rather than as an unacceptable abridgment of majority rule , so the individual rights protected in property and by markets are necessary to the maintenance of a democratic order \u2014 in this , deeper , sense of the word . In the West , choosing to trade with a person in another country is , itself , a democratic act . Electing to start a company in your garage , with no need for another \u2019 s imprimatur , is , itself , a democratic act . Banding together to establish a cooperative is , itself , a democratic act . Selecting the vendor from which you source your goods and services \u2014 and choosing what to buy from it \u2014 is , itself , a democratic act . Keeping the lion \u2019 s share of the fruits of your labor is , itself , a democratic act . When governments step in with their bayonets and say \u201c No ! \u201d they are , in effect , keeping your choices off the ballot .\nProperly understood , the attempt to draw a hard line between \u201c democracy \u201d and \u201c economics \u201d is not only a fool \u2019 s game but a game that socialists do not in fact play themselves . Ugo Okere , a self-described \u201c democratic socialist \u201d who ran for the Chicago City Council earlier this year , was recently praised in Jacobin magazine for explaining that \u201c democratic socialism , to me , is about democratic control of every single facet of our life. \u201d That \u2019 s one way of putting it , certainly . Another is \u201c tyranny. \u201d Or , if you prefer , democratic tyranny . Alexis de Tocqueville observed that \u201c the health of a democratic society may be measured by the quality of functions performed by private citizens. \u201d Lose those functions in America , and you lose democracy in America , too .\nAnd then there is the question of socialism \u2019 s substantive record , which is so extraordinarily disastrous that it renders my friend-in-the-box \u2019 s theoretical argument useless even on its own terms . It is , in a strictly technical sense , \u201c up to us \u201d whether we choose to , say , smash ourselves repeatedly in the face with a hammer , but that is neither here nor there given that nobody in his right mind would elect to smash himself in the face with a hammer . We should avoid socialism with a similar diligence \u2014 and for similar reasons .\nHistory has shown us that socialism exhibits three core defects from which it can not escape and which its champions can not avoid . The first is what Hayek termed \u201c the knowledge problem. \u201d This holds that all economic actors make errors based on imperfect knowledge but that a decentralized economy will suffer less from this , partly because the decision-makers are closer to the information they need , and partly because each actor does not wield total control over everything but is only one part of a larger puzzle . The second problem is that , because socialism eliminates both private property and supply and demand , it eliminates rational incentives and , thereby , rational calculation . The third problem is that socialism , following Marx \u2019 s dialectical theory of history , lends itself to a theory of inevitability or preordination that leaves no room for dissent , and that leads in consequence to the elevation of a political class that responds to failure by searching for wreckers and dissenters to punish . Worse still , because socialists view all questions , including moral questions , through a class lens , these searches tend to be deemed morally positive \u2014 bound , one day , to be regarded by History as Necessary . Together , these defects lead to misery , poverty , corruption , ignorance , authoritarianism , desperation , exodus , and death .\nIronically enough , they also lead to socialism \u2019 s exhibiting a record of failure in precisely the areas where it is supposed to excel . Despite the promises in the brochure , socialism has been terrible at helping the poor ; it has been terrible at helping women advance ; it has been terrible for civil liberties ; it been terrible at helping the environment ; it has been terrible at attracting immigrants ; it has been terrible at tolerating and protecting minorities ; it has been terrible at fostering technology , architecture , and art ; it has been terrible at producing agriculture ; and , worst of all , it has been terrible at sharing power and resources \u2014 indeed , it has done precisely the opposite , creating new \u201c ruling classes \u201d that are far less adept , far less responsive , and far less responsible than the ones they replaced .\nIt has become something of a running joke that , whenever socialism \u2019 s history is highlighted , its diehard advocates insist that \u201c that wasn \u2019 t real socialism. \u201d This defense is frustrating . But it is also instructive , in that it is an admission that , like perpetual motion , socialism has never been realized in the world . The U.S. Constitution has survived for so long because it was built upon the understanding that man is imperfect and always will be , because it accepts that selfishness is ineradicable and so must be harnessed , because it acknowledges that power corrupts as much in our era as it ever did , and because it makes provisions for the fact that disunity is inevitable in any free society . Capitalism , too , has survived because it is built on truth rather than myths . Socialism , by contrast , has failed each and every time it has been tried because it is predicated upon precisely the opposite \u2014 that is , precisely the wrong \u2014 assumptions .\nOne would have imagined that , at some point , \u201c That wasn \u2019 t real socialism . . . \u201d would have been followed by \u201c . . . and real socialism can \u2019 t exist because man isn \u2019 t perfectible , selfishness is ineradicable , power has needed restraining since the dawn of time , and political unity is a dangerous and undesirable myth. \u201d Alas , no such recognition has yet been forthcoming . In the 20th century , Communism killed at least 100 million people \u2014 by democide , by famine , by central planning , by war \u2014 and yet it is still acceptable to say in public that it was a \u201c nice idea. \u201d In the post-war period , \u201c democratic \u201d socialism ravaged the economies of the West like a virus and required a counterrevolution to remove , and yet it remains sufficiently seductive to a slice of the public as to present a threat to the American order . Today , the states that have actively rejected socialism are growing fast ( India , Poland , the former East Germany ) while those that fell prey to the temptation are either moribund ( Greece ) , tyrannies ( China ) , or international pariahs ( Cuba and North Korea ) \u2014 and yet there is still a solipsistic cottage industry dedicated to blaming their successes and failures on decisions made by the United States . The damn thing is ineradicable .\nAnd so we get Venezuela . That Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s centrally planned \u201c Bolivarian Revolution \u201d has descended into dictatorship , repression , starvation , and crisis was apparently genuinely shocking to a good number of the people who write about politics for a living . Six years ago , upon Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s death , the Guardian \u2019 s Simon Reid-Henry reflected the consensus view on the left by arguing that Ch\u00e1vez had shown \u201c that the West \u2019 s ways aren \u2019 t always best \u201d by \u201c [ refashioning ] Venezuelan democracy in ways that he thought better addressed the country \u2019 s long-standing development issues. \u201d His paper \u2019 s editorial board went one further , describing Ch\u00e1vez \u2019 s work as an \u201c unfinished revolution. \u201d Predictably enough , this was in fact a correct characterization of Venezuela \u2019 s fate \u2014 just not in the way that the Guardian had anticipated . Five years after that edition went to print , Ricardo Hausmann , the former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank , was explaining that \u201c Venezuela \u2019 s economic catastrophe dwarfs any in the history of the U.S. , Western Europe or the rest of Latin America . \u201d\n\u201c The West \u2019 s ways aren \u2019 t always best \u201d ? The Venezuelan president is now a ruthless dictator who has cracked down on free speech , prohibited mass political protests , and confiscated firearms from anyone who has been even remotely critical of him . Thirteen percent of the country \u2019 s population has now fled , and those who have remained have been left so degraded by the government \u2019 s price controls that they have gone years without toilet paper , meat , and other basic necessities and have in consequence taken to eating zoo animals for sustenance and to scouring garbage bags for supplies . According to the Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela , the country is suffering through an 85 percent medicine shortage and a 90 percent shortage of basic medical supplies . The child-mortality rate has increased 140 percent . Ninety percent of Venezuelans now live in poverty . This year , the IMF predicts , inflation will hit 10 million percent . All this in a country with the world \u2019 s largest oil reserves \u2014 reserves greater than those of the United States by a factor of ten .\nOne of the great advantages to living at the tail end of 6,000 years or so of human civilization is the chance we have been afforded to look back and learn from the lessons accrued by others without having to go through the pain of learning them for ourselves . History is a complicated thing , and should be treated as such , but there are nevertheless a few core rules by which we can live : Do not inflict laws on others to which you would not subject yourself ; ensure that you distribute power among several rival institutions , and , if possible , several geographical locations ; never relinquish the right to free speech , the right to free conscience , the right to freedom of religion , the right to bear arms , or the right to a jury trial ; insist on being represented by a parliament , and make sure that you prohibit that parliament from loaning its powers to a king , temporarily or permanently ; do not ask people to give up more of their income than they are permitted to keep ; and don \u2019 t , whatever you do , be seduced by socialists bearing promises . And if you are seduced , get out before it \u2019 s too late . You have nothing to lose but your chains .",
