Packed onto the National Mall across the street from the White House Friday , the revelers deafened one another with their joyful shouts , tens of thousands gathered just across the street from President Donald Trump \u2019 s new home , smiling and laughing and breaking into spontaneous cheers .\nSuch was the scene at the 44th annual March for Life , first held here on January 22 , 1974 , one year to the day after the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade that legalized abortion nationwide . In good weather and in bad \u2014 given Washington \u2019 s bitter Januaries , it \u2019 s usually the latter \u2014 crowds swarm the Mall every year to protest against the country \u2019 s abortion laws and to advocate for the protection of unborn life .\nThis year \u2019 s March had particular historic significance , as it followed on the heels of a Republican sweep of November \u2019 s elections and , with it , the chance to enact pro-life policies at the federal level for the first time in years . The crowd never cheered louder than when Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the morning \u2019 s rally , becoming the first member of a presidential administration ever to address the event in person .\n\u201c President Trump actually asked me to be here with you today , \u201d Pence said . \u201c He asked me to thank you for your support \u2014 to thank you for your stand for life and for your compassion for the women and children of America . . . . Compassion is overcoming convenience and hope is defeating despair . In a word : Life is winning in America because of all of you . \u201d\nEvery year the March makes evident just how phenomenally young and vibrant the pro-life movement is , bolstered by students who travel from hundreds of colleges , universities , and high schools all across the country , often sleeping on buses overnight or driving for two days straight to be here .

Steines and his family drove eight hours from Ohio to attend the event . Steines \u2019 s mother , Donna , said that there are smaller , satellite marches for life in Ohio , \u201c but none of them have half a million people . \u201d\nEven though young faces dominated the crowd , people of all ages and genders and races were well represented at the March , as they always are . The Mall this year held a truly heterogeneous mixture of Americans , united in the belief that this country \u2019 s women and children and families deserve better than a regime of abortion on demand .\nDozens of pro-life public figures and movement leaders gathered behind the rally stage , speaking most frequently of the hope embodied by the new administration . One of those activists was David Daleiden , founder of the Center for Medical Progress , which recorded and released the undercover videos that exposed the vast fetal-tissue-trafficking industry profiting off the body parts of aborted babies .\nDozens of pro-life public figures and movement leaders gathered behind the rally stage , speaking most frequently of the hope embodied by the new administration .\nDaleiden told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Trump administration gives pro-life people reason to expect the demise of the abortion industry . \u201c It \u2019 s a historic moment that I think we now have the opportunity to enact the sorts of commonsense , consensus pro-life policies that the vast majority of Americans say they want , \u201d he said .\nJudging from the groups within today \u2019 s crowd , Daleiden is correct .

We lose a little of ourselves and a whole lot of our future .\nPerhaps Love \u2019 s remarks best encapsulate the perpetual hope of the pro-life movement : hope for a future free of the horrific violence of abortion , hope for each mother to embrace the child within her , hope for the potential and promise of every unborn life .
