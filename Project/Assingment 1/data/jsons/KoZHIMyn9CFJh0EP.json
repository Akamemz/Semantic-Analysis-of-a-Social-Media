''\nLast week , Larry Kudlow , the White House economic adviser , proclaimed on Fox News that the uptick in cases `` is no emergency and there is no second wave . '' This week , Vice President Mike Pence echoed that sentiment in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled , `` There Is n't a Coronavirus 'Second Wave . ''\n`` The media has tried to scare the American people every step of the way , and these grim predictions of a second wave are no different , '' Pence wrote .\nPence and Kudlow may be correct to assert that the country is not entering a second wave , but only , experts said , because this is still the first . A consensus of epidemiologists believes the risk of a second wave remains real , but will likely come in the fall . And because the potential for the virus to expand its reach remains a significant cause for concern , they said this is no time to relax preventive measures such as social distancing , hand-washing and mask wearing .\n`` We are in the first wave , but we are in the second inning of a nine-inning game , '' said Dr. Michael Osterholm , an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota .\nCustomers wear masks as they wait to enter a store June 17 , 2020 , in Tempe , Ariz. Matt York/AP\nThe issue may come down to a semantic misunderstanding , Osterholm said . When epidemiologists describe a second wave , they are referring to a reemergence of the virus after a quieter period of minimal transmission .\n`` A wave occurs when you see an increase in cases and then a subsequent decrease in cases with a trough , '' Osterholm explained . `` Then the second wave occurs when you come out of that trough and goes into another large number of cases -- often more so than the first wave . ''\nOthers agreed . Dr. Vincent Racaniello , a Columbia University virologist , told ABC News that many expect cases to decline over the summer months , then flare up again in the fall .\n`` In the cooler months , with lower humidity , the virus transmits better so we see outbreaks of respiratory infections in those times , '' Racaniello said . `` I think that 's what COVID-19 will be like in the fall . ''\nDr. Ashish Jha , general internist and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , warned that `` as schools come back along with universities and workplaces , we 're all very worried we 're going to see big spikes in cases that nationally will result in a second wave .

''\n`` This pattern will require the reinstitution of mitigation measures in the fall in an attempt to drive down spread of infection and prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed , '' the CIDRAP team concluded .\nAdvocates for the most vulnerable Americans took direct aim at Pence for his suggestion that the media has erroneously hyped a second wave .
