The president said he could have been Trayvon Martin . Not likely , given his private schooling and the way he was fast-tracked to success .\nThe president said the history of African-Americans partially explains the way many black people view the case . He spoke of blacks hearing car doors lock as they cross the street and of white women who clutch their purses tightly when a black person enters an elevator .\nThen he touched on the real problem : `` Now , this is n't to say that the African-American community is naive about the fact that African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system , that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence . It 's not to make excuses for that fact , although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context . We understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country , and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history . ''\nOK , but what about poor people in the same neighborhoods who do n't engage in violent behavior ?\nDo n't they have the same history , but make different choices ?\nIt is not news that much poverty in the African-American community stems from broken or never-started families ; or that too many black men leave black women to raise children on their own ; or that the way `` gangsta culture '' is portrayed in the media does not produce an image that is endearing to white employers ; or that public schools in minority neighborhoods are failing to build the foundations necessary for a successful life ; or that the abortion rate among black women is four times higher than non-Hispanic whites among 15-19 year-olds , according to the Guttmacher Institute . Abortion , which the president has done nothing to curtail , also devalues African-American lives .\nThe politics of race plays a role . When black people kill each other , or murder a white person , the president usually feels no need to comment ( the recent murder of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton being a rare exception ) ; Al Sharpton does n't march , Jesse Jackson does n't call for boycotts , or label Florida an `` apartheid state , '' as he did following the Zimmerman verdict . Are black lives only worth mentioning when they are extinguished by non-blacks ?\nThere are black people who are disgusted by the behavior , clothing , attitude and language of some young black men . On the Washington Post 's website last week , beneath a transcript of the president 's remarks last Friday , a reader posting under the name `` Chaquita1 '' offered a personal story about recently being on a train and watching an African-American woman give the evil eye to a pair of young African-American males in `` gangsta wear '' making a commotion .
