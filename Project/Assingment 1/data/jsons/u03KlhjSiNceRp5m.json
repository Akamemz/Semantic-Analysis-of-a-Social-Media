    "content": "President Trump castigated The New York Times and Washington Post yesterday , dusting off his `` enemy '' rhetoric in the seemingly endless war with his two most aggressive newspaper adversaries .\nIn his broadside against a lengthy Times report on the Russia investigation , the president chose a general denunciation , rather than specific denials , and said one thing that turns out not to be true .\nIn cheering on a Covington high school student \u2019 s $ 250 million lawsuit against the Post , Trump is seizing on the paper 's initial reporting on the clash at the Lincoln Memorial last month , which was badly flawed . But that does n't add up to a successful lawsuit .\nThe president pulls no punches against his hometown paper , despite recently granting its publisher and two reporters an 85-minute interview :\n`` The New York Times reporting is false . They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE ! ''\nMUELLER PROBE 'NEAR THE END GAME ' AMID SHAKEUP AT DOJ , SOURCES SAY\nI 've said from the beginning that Trump has every right to hit back against what he sees as unfair reporting \u2014 but that such rhetoric , implying treasonous behavior , goes too far .\nIn a second tweet clearly inspired by the Times story , the president says : `` The Press has never been more dishonest than it is today . Stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact . The writers do n't even call asking for verification . ''\nBut Maggie Haberman , one of the story 's four co-authors , said on CNN that they went over the planned story in detail with the White House and Justice Department :\n`` I sent several emails that went unanswered until yesterday . We went through a detailed list of what we were planning on reporting . They chose not to engage , and afterwards , the president acts surprised . ''\nNAPOLITAN SAYS IF NYT REPORT IS ACCURATE , TRUMP MAY BE IMPLICATED IN ATTEMPTED OBSTRUCTION\nIn response to Trump 's charge , Publisher A.G. Sulzberger said that `` in demonizing the free press as the enemy , simply for performing its role of asking difficult questions and bringing uncomfortable information to light , President Trump is retreating from a distinctly American principle ... The phrase 'enemy of the people ' is not just false , it 's dangerous . ''\nIn the story , the Times says that Trump asked Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker to intervene in the New York investigation focusing on such subjects as Michael Cohen and hush money . ( This is separate from the probe by Bob Mueller , who was reported yesterday to have told Trump lawyers he has finished his report . )\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE 'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST , A RIFF OF THE DAY 'S HOTTEST STORIES\nThe Times also said that as part of his effort to oust then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions , Trump asked Corey Lewandowski to pressure Sessions to resign . Neither Whitaker nor Lewandowski seems to have done anything . And the piece describes Trump changing his instructions to Sean Spicer to describe how Mike Flynn was forced out of the White House .\nWhile Trump is castigating the Times , I 've seen no specific denials that challenge what the paper reported .\nMeanwhile , Nick Sandmann , the Covington teenager who was unfairly maligned by the media mob , has filed a lawsuit against the Post , accusing the paper of bullying him for political reasons .\nQuoting from the lawsuit , Trump tweeted : `` 'The Washington Post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented biased agenda against President Donald J . Trump . ' Covington student suing WAPO . Go get them Nick . Fake News ! ''\nThe suit , brought by lawyer Lin Wood , says : `` In a span of three days in January of this year commencing on January 19 , the Post engaged in a modern-day form of McCarthyism by competing with CNN and NBC , among others , to claim leadership of a mainstream and social media mob of bullies which attacked , vilified , and threatened Nicholas Sandmann , an innocent secondary school child . ''\nWhile the initial reporting by the Post and others was seriously flawed , charges like `` McCarthyism '' are way off base .\nIn the first couple of days , the Post relied too heavily on an edited video that was misleading , and on an interview with Nathan Phillips , the Native American activist who confronted Sandmann , and who said things that were untrue and kept changing his story . Such media accounts did galvanize a social media explosion that unjustly crucified these Catholic kids , some of them wearing MAGA caps . But that doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean a courtroom victory .\nIt 's highly unfortunate that the paper was n't able to interview any of the students . But as for getting their side , the students ' own school and diocese said in a joint statement that `` we condemn '' their behavior , and warned that some might be expelled . The diocese later apologized .\nEven though much of the Post 's reporting about Trump is negative , the first Covington story was written by three metro reporters covering a demonstration on deadline , not political reporters who cover the administration .\nTwo days later , the Post reported that the story was far more complicated than originally reported , including slurs from a black activist group , and quoted Sandmann 's first statement on the confrontation , made to the Cincinnati Enquirer .\nSo it will be an uphill battle for Sandmann 's parents , who filed the suit , to prove malice , as the legal papers claim . As for the eye-popping damages being sought , the suit says that $ 250 million is what Jeff Bezos spent to buy the Post \u2014 in other words , a symbolic figure .\nTrump ended one of his tweets by saying the press is `` totally out of control .
