    "content_original": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized sanctions against any official at the International Criminal Court who investigates US troops, ramping up pressure to stop its case into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nIn an executive order, Trump said the United States would block US property and assets of anyone from The Hague-based tribunal involved in probing or prosecuting US troops.\n\n\u201cWe cannot \u2014 we will not \u2014 stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement to reporters.\n\n\u201cI have a message to many close allies around the world \u2014 your people could be next, especially those from NATO countries who fought terrorism in Afghanistan right alongside of us.\u201d\n\nThe court responded by stating that its president O-Gon Kwon \u201crejects measures taken against ICC,\u201d calling them \u201cunprecedented\u201d and saying they \u201cundermine our common endeavor to fight impunity and to ensure accountability for mass atrocities.\u201d\n\nUS Attorney General Bill Barr alleged, without giving detail, that Russia and other adversaries of the United States have been \u201cmanipulating\u201d the court.\n\nUsing Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d language, Barr said the administration was trying to bring accountability to a global body.\n\n\u201cThis institution has become, in practice, little more than a political tool employed by unaccountable international elites,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Contempt\u2019 for rule of law\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell voiced \u201cserious concern\u201d and said the court \u201cmust be respected and supported by all nations.\u201d\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said he was \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by the US move, and said The Netherlands supported the court on its soil.\n\n\u201cThe ICC is crucial in the fight against impunity and upholding international rule of law,\u201d Blok wrote on Twitter.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said Trump\u2019s order \u201cdemonstrates contempt for the global rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis assault on the ICC is an effort to block victims of serious crimes whether in Afghanistan, Israel or Palestine from seeing justice,\u201d said the group\u2019s Washington director, Andrea Prasow.\n\nBut the move was hailed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump\u2019s closest allies, who has been angered by the ICC\u2019s moves \u2014 strongly opposed by Washington \u2014 to probe alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories.\n\nIn a reference to Israeli settlements, Netanyahu accused the court of fabricating accusations that Jews living in their historical homeland constitutes a war crime.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. Shame on them,\u201d Netanyahu told reporters.\n\nTrump has been tearing down global institutions he sees as hindering his administration\u2019s interests, recently ordering a pullout from the World Health Organization over its coronavirus response.\n\nLong-running US anger\n\nThe Trump administration has been livid over the International Criminal Court\u2019s investigation into atrocities in Afghanistan, America\u2019s longest-running war.\n\nThe administration last year revoked the US visa of the court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Gambian-born Fatou Bensouda, to demand that she end the Afghanistan probe.\n\nBut judges in March said the investigation could go ahead, overturning an initial rejection of Bensouda\u2019s request.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s order on Thursday, visa restrictions will be expanded to any court official involved in investigations into US forces.\n\nThe United States argues that it has its own procedures in place to investigate accusations against troops.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to uncovering, and if possible holding people accountable, for their wrongdoing \u2014 any wrongdoing,\u201d Barr said.\n\nTrump, however, used his executive powers last year to clear three military members over war crimes, including in Afghanistan.\n\nAmong them was Eddie Gallagher, who had been convicted by a military tribunal of stabbing to death with a hunting knife a prisoner of war from the Islamic State group in Iraq.\n\nGallagher had become a cause celebre among US conservatives, although Trump\u2019s action troubled some in the US military.\n\nFounded in 2002, the International Criminal Court immediately ran into opposition from Washington, where the then administration of George W.
