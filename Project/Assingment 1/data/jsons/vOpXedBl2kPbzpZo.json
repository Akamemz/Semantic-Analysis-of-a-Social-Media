If the judge does not accept the indictment , the case will be dropped . Falsely reporting a crime is punishable by a fine or up to six months in prison .\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee said in a statement late Thursday that the swimmers ' behavior was `` not acceptable , nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members .
