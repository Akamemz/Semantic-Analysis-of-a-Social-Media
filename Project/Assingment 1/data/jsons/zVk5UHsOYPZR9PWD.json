Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump have tightly wound their political fates together in Florida , a state that amounts to a must-win if the president hopes to serve another term in the White House .\nBut as the nation hurtles toward a contentious general-election contest , Florida has emerged as a key national hot spot for the resurgent coronavirus pandemic . This even as the president is primed to try to use the state as a show of strength for his now-relocated Republican National Convention nomination acceptance speech in August\u2014a plan that is already causing anxiety among some locals .\nAnd the rapid ascent of COVID-19 in the Sunshine State has proven precarious for DeSantis \u2019 standing in Florida , raising the prospect that a reopening some residents and experts say has been rushed could mean trouble for the president come November .\nThe situation in the state grew even more troubling Friday , according to the Miami Herald , as the state smashed its single-day record set this week for new cases with a count of close to 9,000 testing positive . The previous high , according to the newspaper , came Wednesday when 5,508 new COVID-19 cases marked a new one-day record in the state .\n\u201c If you look around the country , most governors , regardless of party , saw their numbers rise \u201d during the early part of the pandemic , noted Jeff Garcia , a Democratic political consultant based in Miami . He pointed to a decline for DeSantis from 58 percent to 51 percent in approval in an April analysis of polls by FiveThirtyEight\u2014long before the recent surge in cases . Meanwhile , governors of 14 other states hit hard by the pandemic , such as Michigan , Washington , and New York , experienced double-digit positive gains .\n\u201c DeSantis is in a rare category , \u201d added Garcia . \u201c He is not overwhelmingly disliked , but he has seen a precipitous drop in his approval rating . \u201d\nFlorida , on the other hand , is among the states showing the sharpest trend upward in confirmed new COVID-19 cases in recent days , according to Johns Hopkins University . And in an analysis last week , the PolicyLab at Children \u2019 s Hospital of Philadelphia voiced concern that \u201c Florida has all the makings of the next large epicenter . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s the fear shared by Bernard Ashby , a Florida-based cardiologist and health-policy expert . Despite Florida having a large Medicare-eligible population and many people vulnerable to COVID-19 , the state \u2019 s lead physician for the Committee to Protect Medicare said the governor 's response to the pandemic has been more economically focused , \u201c with public health being an afterthought . \u201d\n\u201c I would definitely think that voters , especially voters who fall into that vulnerable population , would obviously be concerned by the lack of leadership from the federal level and the state level regarding the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic , \u201d Ashby said , looking ahead to November \u2019 s general election .\nA spokesman for DeSantis did not respond to an email seeking comment on whether his handling of the coronavirus may hurt President Donald Trump \u2019 s ability to win the state in November . But on Thursday , DeSantis seemed to recognize the challenges the spike poses for Florida \u2019 s reopening moving forward .\n\u201c We are where we are , \u201d DeSantis told reporters when asked about the state \u2019 s reopening . \u201c I didn \u2019 t say we \u2019 re going to go on to the next phase . \u201d\nBefore the pandemic , observers say DeSantis had made gains with voters after his narrow victory over Democrat Andrew Gillum in 2018 . But the pandemic appears to have set the governor in a more fluid position politically amid concerns over his administration \u2019 s response .\nRod Deal wasn \u2019 t a fan of DeSantis when the Republican ran for governor in 2018 . But even after voting for Gillum , the 38-year-old Miami-based photographer \u2019 s resistance faded and he warmed to DeSantis shortly after the GOP leader took office .\n\u201c I thought he was also making strides in solar power energy and increasing teachers \u2019 salaries , \u201d Deal said . \u201c I thought he was putting the people \u2019 s needs first . From what I saw , I thought I will vote for him next time . \u201d\nThen the coronavirus pandemic hit , and Deal \u2019 s positive impressions of DeSantis evaporated .\n\u201c It was only in the last three months that I started wondering , \u2018 What the hell is up with this dude ? \u201d Deal said . \u201c Opening up the entire state with the COVID numbers going up was horrible . \u201d\nWhile most governors during the pandemic have seen a \u201c rally around the flag \u201d dynamic , a poll detailed by The Washington Post in May found that DeSantis had one of the lowest coronavirus approval ratings among the nation \u2019 s 50 governors . Still , it \u2019 s worth noting that the Florida governor did fare 15 points better than the president .\nJ. Edwin Benton , a political science professor at the University of South Florida , said if the spiking in Florida is due to unwise decisions by DeSantis , then that is going to reflect badly , and not just on the governor .\n\u201c If he has to own that and if people are looking to DeSantis as a role model for the state and he doesn \u2019 t look good , then by implication it \u2019 s going to have a similar if not equal effect on Donald Trump \u2019 s chances of winning the state in November , \u201d Benton said .\nThe governor dragged his feet on issuing a stay-at-home order while the virus swept through the country earlier this year , finally relenting on April 1 . It \u2019 s part of a larger approach that has invited rebuke from within the rank and file of state government .\nIn May , Rebekah Jones , a former Florida Department of Health data staffer , alleged to media outlets that she was forced out of her position after declining to alter state health data . In a recent media blitz , she has aggressively questioned the authenticity of the state \u2019 s COVID-19 figures .\n\u201c I have multiple sources at DOH who have just told me they have been instructed this week to change the numbers and begin slowly deleting deaths and cases so it looks like Florida is improving next week in the lead-up to July 4 , like they \u2019 ve \u201c made it over the hump , \u201d Jones tweeted earlier this week .\nThe situation also led to a public challenge to DeSantis on Thursday from Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried .
