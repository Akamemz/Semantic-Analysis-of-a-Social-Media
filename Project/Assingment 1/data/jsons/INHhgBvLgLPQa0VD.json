The blowout preventer is the last-ditch preventer . It was activated too late in Macondo . If you get to the point where it \u2019 s all you \u2019 ve got , it better be good . But the system process we identified \u2014 attention to management , process design , adherence to the system \u2014 those are really vital long before you ever get to the point where you have an emergency . \u201d\nMr. Reilly blamed Congress for some of the continued systemic problems , saying that lawmakers should have appropriated funds to increase programs for safety training and inspection .\nAdministration officials say that since the spill , the Interior Department has initiated the most aggressive and comprehensive offshore oil and gas regulation and oversight in history .

After the accident , the Interior Department was restructured , separating the agency charged with overseeing safety from the one charged with overseeing the collection of revenue .\nThe agency has also put in place a requirement that any company performing deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico must have access to containment dome technology \u2014 essentially , a dome that can be put over an exploded well to contain gushing oil .
