    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nThe left\u2019s construct of identity politics is a scourge, not just because it\u2019s insulting and shortsighted, but also because the impact of conditioning people into identifying through one sliver of who they are strips away the power of the individual. Ultimately, it destroys lives. By design, that allows politicians to more easily control and manipulate the targets populating their own base: women, people of color and gays.\n\nThere are examples of this throughout the last century highlighting how racial and sexual minorities are shamed, denigrated and even their very identities are threatened if they don\u2019t do as they\u2019re told politically or refuse to conform to the liberal worldview.\n\nThe most recent illustration comes courtesy of the former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nAs Mr. Biden is apt to do, he said something without thinking and for the left, that\u2019s dangerous. In an interview with a very popular radio host, Charlamagne tha God, he revealed the ugly truth about the Democratic strategy and attitude toward black Americans. At one point after a series of questions, Charlamagne said: \u201cIt\u2019s a long way until November, we got more questions.\u201d Mr. Biden responded, \u201cYou got more questions but I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d Stunned, Charlamagne responded, \u201cIt don\u2019t have nothing to do with Trump, it has to do with the fact I want something for my community. \u2026\u201d\n\nThat exchange, in a nutshell, illustrates the worst nightmare of the Democrats.

It is voter intimidation of the highest order.
