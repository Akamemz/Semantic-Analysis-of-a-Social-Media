A close friend working there estimated they have 10 ventilators . That \u2019 s for the entire country\u2026 In those places where contagion will be rampant and resources are most scarce , it is the World Health Organization that has boots on the ground and will be a vital partner in saving lives . Its teams will work to flatten the curve from Burundi to Bolivia , and in so doing , help prevent the continued transmission of the novel coronavirus across borders . They will stymie the progression of second waves like those we are actively suppressing in Asia . And they will keep the disease from coming back to America \u2019 s shores , where we have already sacrificed so much to defeat it. \u201d Dr. Craig Spencer , USA Today\n\u201c Many Americans know nothing about the W.H.O. , but its worldwide budget ( of which the United States pays about one-fifth ) is less than that of some American hospital centers . Yet it is charged with fighting Ebola and polio , saving children \u2019 s lives and keeping the world safe from pandemics like this one\u2026 It developed an effective diagnostic test that is used in dozens of countries , while the United States still can not manage adequate testing . In late January and in February , the W.H.O . issued increasingly urgent warnings about the coronavirus . Trump ignored them , instead insisting that it was \u2018 totally under control \u2019 \u2026 Gutting the W.H.O . will mean more kids dying of malnutrition , more moms dying of cervical cancer , and the coronavirus infecting more people in more countries. \u201d Nicholas Kristof , New York Times\n\u201c The WHO has handled the coronavirus \u2019 s emergence more nimbly than it did Ebola , reflecting the reforms made in the wake of that sluggish and inept response . But there is concern about the praise it has lavished on China and its leadership despite the anxieties over human rights , the length of time it took China to confirm human-to-human transmission and the cover-up of the scale and seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan by authorities , which allowed Covid-19 \u2019 s spread within China and abroad . The organisation has treated Taiwan appallingly , thanks to its concern for relations with Beijing\u2026 But suggesting that WHO officials are in thrall to China is a facile explanation . The WHO is a membership organisation , with responsibility but not power . It can try to steer member states , but has no sanctions ; without sticks , it relies on carrots . It needs China \u2019 s cooperation \u2013 not least because the precise origins of coronavirus within Wuhan remain unclear. \u201d Editorial Board , The Guardian\n\u201c Trump says the organization should have been more forthcoming , sounded the alarm louder , chastised and cajoled China into being better than it is . It \u2019 s a big ask , one that even the world \u2019 s most powerful nations and corporations shy away from in the face of Beijing \u2019 s thin skin and economic might \u2026 \u201c Does the WHO play ball , so to speak , with China ? Absolutely . The organization , for better or worse , is a deeply political body , not necessarily in its intent but in its functioning . It must operate across hundreds of member states , navigating complex political histories and allegiances to remain relevant but also reliable enough to get much-needed information . Without much tangible authority to punish , it must rely on prodding and pleasantries . Ironically , the actual solution to the WHO \u2019 s shortcomings exposed by the pandemic is likely more authority , not less . More capacity , not less . But there \u2019 s no political will for that , even now when the world \u2019 s on fire. \u201d Elliot Hannon , Slate\n\u201c Much of what he said the U.N. health group did wrong\u2026 mirrors the president 's own actions during that same time period\u2026 The National Security Council had intelligence by early January of a China outbreak that could threaten the United States , and by the end of the month , Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro was warning of a pandemic that could kill up to half a million Americans . Yet for weeks , Trump dismissed concerns about the pandemic threat and did n't urge social distancing until the middle of March . Moreover , on Jan. 24 , Trump tweeted praise for China 's handling of the epidemic , including the nation 's \u2018 transparency , \u2019 adding , \u2018 It will all work out well .
