Iran has neither directly confirmed or denied this but has said that Israel 's attacks on Syria were founded `` on self-proclaimed , baseless pretexts '' .\nIran has deployed hundreds of troops in Syria , ostensibly as military advisers to the Syrian military . Thousands of militiamen armed , trained and financed by Iran have also been battling rebel forces alongside Syrian soldiers .\nOn Thursday , in response to the Golan Heights attack , Israel said its fighter jets had struck almost all of Iran 's military infrastructure inside Syria - some 70 targets - in its biggest assault since Syria 's civil war started in 2011 .\nIran and Israel are enemies but have never fought a direct war .\nForeign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted on Iranian state TV as saying : `` Iran strongly condemns ... [ Israel 's ] attacks on Syria . The international community 's silence encourages Israel 's aggression . Syria has every right to defend itself . ''\nMr Qasemi said Israel `` can not stand peace and stability in the region and sees its own safety in making the region all the more unstable '' .\nHe said Israel 's `` baseless pretexts amount to a blatant violation of Syria 's sovereignty and goes against all international conventions '' .\nHe did not refer to Iran 's military presence inside Syria .\nMr Qasemi said the attacks were an attempt by international supporters of rebel groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to shore them up after their `` many failures '' and to try to `` tip the scales in their favour '' .\nThe Syrian government , backed by Iran and Russia , has made significant gains over the rebel groups in the past year .\nA defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Iran had `` crossed a red line '' and Israel 's action `` was a consequence '' of that .\nHe said : `` We will not allow Iran to entrench itself in Syria . I delivered a clear message to the Assad regime - our action is directed against Iranian targets in Syria . However , if the Syrian military acts against us , we will act against it . ''\nHe added : `` Whoever hurts us , we will hurt them sevenfold , and whoever is preparing to hurt us , we will act to hit them first . ''\nVisiting the Golan Heights on Friday , Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman urged Mr Assad to `` throw the Iranians out '' , saying `` they are only hurting you '' .\nDanny Danon , Israel 's ambassador to the United Nations , called for a UN condemnation of Iran 's `` acts of aggression '' and for the Security Council to `` demand that Iran remove its military presence from Syria '' .\nThe Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) said that early on Thursday morning 20 rockets had been launched at its forward posts in the Golan Heights by the Quds Force , the overseas operations arm of Iran 's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps .\nThe Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria , about 50km ( 30 miles ) from the capital Damascus .
