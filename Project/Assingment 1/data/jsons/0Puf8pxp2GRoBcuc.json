Patty Murray \u2013 a big if \u2013 you will get a final Christmas present : You \u2019 ll have to pay more into your pension , an effective wage cut that just adds to the $ 114 billion , with a `` B , '' federal employees have already given back to the government in the name of deficit reduction .\nThe deal between House and Senate negotiators Ryan and Murray would reverse part of sequestration for 2014 and 2015 , itself a major source of pain for federal workers . But negotiators want to pay for that relief in future years , with the overall package cutting the deficit by an additional $ 23 billion . And one of the major \u201c pay-fors \u201d is an increase in federal employee pension contributions . President Obama \u2019 s 2014 budget included such a proposal , which would have raised the employee contribution in three stages , from 0.8 percent of salary to 2 percent . Congress had already made this shift for new hires ; the Obama proposal would affect all workers hired before 2012 .\nThat proposed increased contribution translated to a 1.2 percent pay cut , and a total of around $ 20 billion in givebacks over 10 years . Negotiators were pressured by the powerful Maryland Democratic delegation , including Minority Leader Steny Hoyer , House Budget Committee ranking member Chris Van Hollen and Senate Appropriations Committee chairwoman Barbara Mikulski , into softening the blow on federal employees , many of whom live in their districts . According to Sen. Murray , the increase in contributions now equals about $ 6 billion over 10 years . But negotiators traded some of the cuts to federal employee pensions with different cuts to military pensions , also totaling $ 6 billion . So whatever the occupation , people who work for the government will bear the brunt of the pain .\nA small pay cut doesn \u2019 t sound like much . But you have to add that to the pile of hits federal workers have taken over the past several years . Government pay has been frozen since January 2010 . The only way you \u2019 ve gotten a raise over the last four years if you work for the government is if you received a promotion or a similar advance . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this has reduced the purchasing power of a government salary by over 7 percent since 2010 . The deal to avoid the government shutdown in October finally broke this fever with a 1 percent pay raise starting in January . This budget deal would wipe much of that out .\nPay freezes are just the beginning . In February , hundreds of thousands of federal workers were forced into unpaid furloughs in accordance with sequestration \u2019 s across-the-board budget cuts . In virtually every federal agency , workers had to take as many as 15 unpaid days off during the last fiscal year . Then , when the government shutdown occurred , workers were again sent home without knowing if they would ever get paid for the missed time . The lack of cash flow stressed workers and made it difficult to pay bills on time . Fortunately , Congress did provide back pay for the 6.6 million work days missed during the shutdown . However , that comes out of agency budgets , and workers have to still complete their tasks without the ability to hire additional personnel to make up the time .\nThe Federal Workers Alliance , a coalition of unions representing federal employees , estimated in a message to the budget negotiators that between the pay freeze and furloughs , federal employees have sacrificed $ 114 billion in pay cuts over the past three years , an average of over $ 50,000 per employee . Yet somehow , budget negotiators are going to the well again .\nIt \u2019 s notable that this attack targets public pensions , which have been under assault all over the country .

Now , under the proposed budget deal , federal pensions would be subject to higher employee contributions . The Federal Workers Alliance notes that the average annual pension benefit for federal employees is just $ 12,800 per year . The proposed increased costs amount to close to hundreds of dollars a year in lost take-home pay without any increase to that meager benefit . Moreover , they represent a weakening of public pensions generally , at a time when the loss of pensions in the private sector , in favor of shaky 401 ( k ) -style plans , has contributed to a retirement crisis .
