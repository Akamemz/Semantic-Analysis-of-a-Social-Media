    "content": "This week , Paul Krugman of The New York Times posited a theory : Red states cause depression and suicide . In a column titled `` America 's Red State Death Trip , '' Krugman wrote : `` In 1990 , today 's red and blue states had almost the same life expectancy . Since then , however , life expectancy in Clinton states has risen more or less in line with other advanced countries , compared with almost no gain in Trump country . At this point , blue-state residents can expect to live more than four years longer than their red-state counterparts . '' On this basis , Krugman blasts Attorney General William Barr , who suggested earlier this year that militant secularism lies behind rising mortality in the United States . Instead , Krugman suggested that `` these evils are concentrated in states that voted for Trump , and have largely bypassed the more secular blue states . ''\nKrugman 's analysis here is deeply flawed . It is flawed because it is far too simplistic . First off , states are not good proxies for political viewpoint within states , which would be far more telling : Texas encompasses both Austin and Lubbock , for example . Secondly , Krugman links 2016 voting patterns to 1990 data , but some of the states hit hardest by the opioid epidemic shifted over that same time frame from blue to red ( e.g. , Ohio , West Virginia and Michigan ) , demonstrating that voting may have resulted from distress , not the other wary around . But more importantly , Krugman assumes that conservatism presages lower life expectancy , rather than that those in lower-income rural areas are turning toward conservatism as a result of the social liberalism pushed forward by the left .\nThis analysis , as it turns out , is false . The reality is that broad trends over time point to the fact that low-income Americans have been disproportionately affected by the rise of social liberalism : the decline in religiosity , and the concomitant collapse of church and other social institutions have undermined precisely the same people who have been hit hard by the economy . Charles Murray pointed out this phenomenon in his book `` Coming Apart '' nearly a decade ago : America has bifurcated between more highly educated , higher-income Americans ( Murray labels them residents of Belmont ) and less educated , lower-income Americans ( Murray labels them residents of Fishtown ) . This holds true regardless of race .
