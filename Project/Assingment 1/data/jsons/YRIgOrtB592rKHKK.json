In recent months , his Friday prayer sermons have removed a prime minister , eased a violent crackdown \u2013 the worst of the violence reportedly the result of hard-line guidance from Iran \u2013 and warned against any foreign intervention in Iraq .\nGrand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani articulates a more liberal interpretation that respects a secular state in Iraq . That 's in contrast to the system of absolute clerical rule in Iran , led by the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , which has dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution .\nMonths of anti-government protests in Iraq have rejuvenated the theological dispute between the religious rulers of Iraq and Iran and their rival views about the role clerics should play in politics . At stake is leadership of the world \u2019 s 200 million-plus Shiites .\nUnited briefly in their mourning over the assassination of Iran \u2019 s most powerful military commander , Qassem Soleimani , two rival titans of the Shiite Muslim world both paid their respects .\nGrand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , the reclusive top religious authority in Iraq , sent his son to greet the funeral procession as it filled the shrine city of Najaf with mourners .\nAnd he sent his condolences to Iran \u2019 s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , his longtime rival for influence over the Shiite world .\nBut when Ayatollah Khamenei called for \u201c severe revenge \u201d against the United States , Grand Ayatollah Sistani called on all parties \u201c to behave with self-restraint . \u201d\nThe divergent responses encapsulate one facet of a broader theological contest \u2013 newly rejuvenated by months of anti-government protests in Iraq \u2013 between the religious rulers of Iraq and Iran , and their two very different worldviews about the role that Shiite clerics should play in politics and daily life .\nAt stake , analysts note , is leadership of the world \u2019 s 200 million-plus Shiites . And as Iraq \u2019 s protests have unfolded since Oct. 1 , the pressure points between these two tectonic plates of Shiite politics are being exposed and redefined like never before .\nAyatollah Sistani articulates a more liberal interpretation that respects a secular state in Iraq . That stands in contrast to the system of absolute clerical rule in Iran , called velayat-e faqih , which is led by Ayatollah Khamenei and has dominated Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .\n\u201c He supports our desires , \u201d says Ali , a young Iraqi in Najaf , where Ayatollah Sistani leads a powerful Islamic seminary . The majority of Iraqis , says Ali , sitting in a protest tent hung with three posters of Ayatollah Sistani that outline his views , \u201c are waiting for [ his ] call . \u201d\nTo be sure , Ayatollah Sistani still wields great political influence . His authority has been on display during months of Friday prayer sermons , where his words have removed a prime minister , eased a violent crackdown that has taken some 460 lives \u2013 the worst of the violence reportedly the result of hard-line guidance from Iran \u2013 and warned against any foreign intervention in Iraq .\nIn the recent sermons \u201c we have seen more liberal , political Shiism being spelled out than in the hundred years before , \u201d says an Iraqi government analyst , a native of Najaf who asked not to be further identified .\n\u201c If we are to mention a single factor that prevented a totally bloody crackdown against the protests , it would be [ Ayatollah Sistani \u2019 s ] Friday sermons , \u201d says the analyst . \u201c And by doing so , he has put a limit on the Iranian approach . He stopped Iraqis taking Iranian advice . \u201d\nBy contrast , in addition to their core demands for political change , Iraqi protesters have burned portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei , sacked Iranian consulates , and attacked Iran-backed Shiite parties and militia groups in their anger over Iran \u2019 s extensive influence .\n\u201c We are seeing these two schools \u2013 at least the Iraqi , Sistani one \u2013 taking clearer shape , under pressure of these events , \u201d says the analyst . \u201c It seems that [ Sistani ] is shifting away even farther from velayat-e faqih into a different , yet-to-be-clearly-spelled-out Shi \u2019 i theory of governance , that is definitely more liberal , that does not see instructing people as one of the duties of an ayatollah . \u201d\nYet in the religious-political construct of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Ayatollah Khamenei is in charge of the perpetual revolution and has final say in all affairs of state . As the personification of the faqih , Ayatollah Khamenei is meant to be the official representative of the infallible 12th Shiite saint , Imam Mahdi , who disappeared centuries ago .\n\u201c It is well-known \u2013 this is not a secret \u2013 Sistani is more on the side of tolerance and coexistence , \u201d says Abbas Kadhim , head of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington .\nHadi Mizban/AP Posters honoring Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani adorn bullet-ridden blast walls at the site of the U.S. strike that killed him . Images of revered Shiite religious figures , including Iraq 's Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , were also put up in tribute , in Baghdad , Iraq , Jan. 16 , 2020 .\n\u201c Khamenei and the velayat-e faqih system is [ based ] more on the exclusive claim to authority , \u201d says Mr. Kadhim , who is from Najaf . The Iranian system refers to Ayatollah Khamenei as the \u201c guardian \u201d of all Muslims , whether they believe they should follow him or not .\n\u201c The only reason they tolerate other voices outside Iran is because they don \u2019 t have authority over those , \u201d says Mr. Kadhim . \u201c So from Sistani \u2019 s perspective , if velayat-e faqih takes control of Iraq , there will be no Sistani , or there will be Sistani under house arrest . ... These guys in Najaf are fighting for their own very existence . \u201d\nThe style of these towering rivals also could not be more different . Ayatollah Sistani has some 600 representatives across Iraq , and a global network beyond . He earned public reverence with careful , infrequent intervention that \u201c helped Iraq a great deal to save the day every time the country was about to fall apart , \u201d says Mr. Kadhim .\nThat respect has been enhanced , he says , by \u201c not micromanaging the daily public life of Iraqis ... because he \u2019 s not like what you see in Iran , or a place like Saudi Arabia ... where there is a religious police mentality . \u201d\nIn Iran , however , every public and social step is scrutinized and controlled by laws such as mandatory head-covering for women . Every aspect of politics is officially defined by devotion to velayat-e faqih , which was a marginal Shiite concept for centuries until it was put into practice four decades ago by the first leader of Iran \u2019 s revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .\nUnder Ayatollah Sistani \u2019 s leadership , the Najaf seminary \u201c has successfully revived a traditional approach to Shia politics as a rival to velayat-e faqih , \u201d writes Ali Mamouri , a former seminarian , in a September analysis for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .\n\u201c In articulating his own version ... Sistani refers explicitly to velayat-e insan ( state guardianship by the people ) , as opposed to velayat-e faqih ( guardianship of the jurist ) , \u201d or clerical rule , writes Mr. Mamouri .\nAs Iraq \u2019 s protests grew to become the most widespread since the U.S. invasion of 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein , there was an indirect back-and-forth dialogue between the Iranian and Iraqi Shiite schools .\nWhen Ayatollah Khamenei instructed \u201c those who love Iraq \u201d to stamp out insecurity , for example , Ayatollah Sistani declared his stance against a violent crackdown . When Ayatollah Khamenei called the Iraqi protests a foreign-backed \u201c sedition \u201d \u2013 as Iranian officials label any anti-government protests in their own country \u2013 Ayatollah Sistani backed the protesters \u2019 call for change and told the government to \u201c recalculate \u201d its decision not to step down .\nAnd clearly irritated by Iran \u2019 s continuing intrusions , Ayatollah Sistani in December called for the new government to be formed \u201c without foreign interference . \u201d\n\u201c With Iran gaining influence across the region , Tehran is eager to claim moral leadership over the more than 200 million Shiites around the world , \u201d wrote Mr. Mamouri for the Al-Monitor website in April 2018 .\n\u201c With Sistani pushing 90 and facing persistent rumors of ill health , Khamenei and his allies see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take over Najaf , the spiritual capital of the Shiite world , \u201d he wrote . \u201c Its most immediate impact will be felt on Iraq \u2019 s capacity to continue charting its own path in the shadow of the Islamic theocracy next door . \u201d\nBoosting that capacity for Iraq has been an uphill battle for Ayatollah Sistani , despite his vast authority .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s face it : The style of the Iranian leadership is the style of a state , not a religion or a religious leadership , \u201d says Mr. Kadhim of the Atlantic Council , noting that states have a monopoly over violence , as does the faqih in Iran .\nAyatollah Sistani , by contrast , \u201c does not have a claim of monopoly , or even a shared responsibility or right to use violence , \u201d says Mr. Kadhim . \u201c He is an absolutely non-violent man . He doesn \u2019 t believe in coercion . \u201d\nIn addition , Ayatollah Sistani has refused to meet \u201c hard-liners , \u201d such as figures close to Ayatollah Khamenei , including the Lebanese Hezbollah leader , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah .\nHis attempts to integrate Iraq \u2019 s Iran-backed Shiite militias into the state military \u2013 against Ayatollah Khamenei \u2019 s express wishes \u2013 \u201c have limited Iranian influence , \u201d writes Mr. Mamouri for the Washington Institute .\nMr. Sistani has also demonstrated restraint in another way , by choosing not to turn Iraq into a clerical-run system like Iran .\n\u201c Sistani could turn Iraq into velayat-e faqih not tomorrow , but this evening , if he wants , \u201d adds Mr. Kadhim . \u201c Yet he doesn \u2019 t , and that is an important distinction . Sistani \u2019 s lack of inclination to assume a lot of power ... deserves a lot of respect . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s respect he also gets from Iran , despite the dispute .\n\u201c Khamenei respects Sistani very much . He also respects the fatwas of Sistani , even if they are against him , \u201d says Hisham al-Hashemi , a Baghdad-based security analyst with the European Institute of Peace . \u201c I know lots of Khamenei \u2019 s followers . They have very firm instructions not to talk [ negatively ] about Sistani in any way . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
