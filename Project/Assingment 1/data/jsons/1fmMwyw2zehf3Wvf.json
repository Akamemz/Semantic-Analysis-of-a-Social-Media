But amid the coronavirus pandemic, many Americans are rushing to use cashless payments, eager to avoid touching surfaces potentially contaminated with the virus.

And as businesses look at reopening, they are implementing cashless protocols, such as Starbucks\u2019 pledge to shift to cashless payments so customers don\u2019t have to worry about virus spread.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nFor cashless proponents, the pandemic is demonstrating why it\u2019s time to go digital. Cash can spread germs as it moves through hands, they say. And cashless payments are faster: The millions of Americans still waiting for mailed coronavirus stimulus checks could have had the money deposited directly into their bank accounts.\n\nAdvocates also argue that swiping or hovering a card over a terminal is more convenient than counting out bills.

Amid the pandemic, Democrats have floated plans to give Americans \u201cdigital dollars\u201d for future stimulus relief and to provide banking for those without accounts, but no legislation has yet been passed.\n\nPerspectives\n\nProponents\n\nCash is dirty and can carry germs\n\n\u201cDo I want to grab the thing that you were just holding in your hand?
