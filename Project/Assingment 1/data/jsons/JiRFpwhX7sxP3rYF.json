    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s team said Sunday that he wasn \u2019 t just smart but a \u201c genius \u201d after a leaked tax return from the 1990s showed a nearly $ 1 billion write-off that likely got him out of paying taxes for years , but it also buttressed accusations by Hillary Clinton that he has avoided taxes .\nThe Republican presidential nominee \u2019 s tax bill was already a burning issue in the campaign , fueled by Mr. Trump \u2019 s refusal to follow tradition and release his federal income tax returns , when a bombshell report revealed the huge deduction in 1996 that could have eliminated years of tax debt .\nMr. Trump also teed up the controversy by quipping in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would have been \u201c smart \u201d if he had avoided paying taxes , as the former first lady charged .\nFormer New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended Mr. Trump \u2019 s tax moves by boasting that the billionaire businessman was an \u201c absolute genius . \u201d\n\u201c It shows you what a genius he is , how smart he is , how intelligent he is , how strategic he is . I want that working for me [ as president ] , \u201d Mr. Giuliani , an adviser to the Trump campaign , said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week . \u201d\nHe stressed that the 20-year-old deduction was \u201c perfectly legal , \u201d noting that years of tax audits never resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump .\n\u201c We should get that straight immediately . This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code , \u201d he said . \u201c He would have been a fool not to take advantage of it . Not only that , he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to his investors , to his business . \u201d\nAlthough the write-off had the potential to keep Mr. Trump from owing any taxes for as much as 18 years , the billionaire \u2019 s earnings in subsequent years likely exceeded the amount of the deduction and resulted in tax debt , Mr. Giuliani said .\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie also called Mr. Trump a \u201c genius \u201d who followed the law .\n\u201c Politically , he has said he is going to change these laws , and there \u2019 s no one who is better suited to change these laws than someone like him that has been subjected to audit after audit by the IRS year after year after year , \u201d Mr. Christie , a former primary rival who now leads the Trump campaign \u2019 s transition team , said on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\nBefore the 1996 state tax return surfaced Saturday , Mr. Trump was under fire for saying in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would be \u201c smart \u201d if he got out of paying taxes .\n\u201c Maybe he doesn \u2019 t want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he \u2019 s paid nothing in federal taxes , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said on the debate stage at Hofstra University in New York .\nClinton camping spokesman Brian Fallon said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Christie were \u201c doubling down \u201d on the debate remark .\n\u201c He [ should ] release all his returns so we see his full brilliance , \u201d tweeted Mr. Fallon .\nSen. Bernard Sanders , a self-identified socialist who was Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s primary rival but has become a top surrogate , said Americans were \u201c disgusted \u201d by Mr. Trump \u2019 s tax deduction .\nHe said that billionaires such as Mr. Trump get their lobbyists and \u201c friends on Capitol Hill \u201d to put loopholes in the tax code so that they pay no taxes . But middle-class Americans get stuck with the bill for schools , infrastructure and the military , he said .\n\u201c Trump goes around and says , \u2018 Hey , I \u2019 m worth billions . I \u2019 m a successful businessman . But I don \u2019 t pay any taxes . But you , you make 15 bucks an hour . You pay the taxes , not me. \u2019 That is why people are angry and want real change , \u201d he said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nA 1996 state tax return obtained by The New York Times showed Mr. Trump claiming a $ 916 million net operating loss . The massive deduction could have shielded him from any tax liability for up to 18 years , according to tax experts .\nThe report added pressure on Mr. Trump to release his tax returns .\nThere is no legal prohibition against releasing tax records amid an audit . There also is no legal requirement that he release the returns , although every presidential candidate for the last 40 years has done so .\nMrs. Clinton has released years of federal income tax returns filed jointly by herself and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , which included some eyebrow-raising deductions .\nThe Clintons previously claimed charitable donations of clothes , including Mr. Clinton \u2019 s used underwear , valued at as much as $ 2 each .\nIn their 2015 return , they deducted charitable donations , including a $ 1 million donation to the Clinton Family Foundation , which distributes money to various charities , including to the Clinton Foundation , which pays for some of the Clintons \u2019 expenses such as travel .\nThe Trump campaign responded to the report by accusing the newspaper of attempting to aid Mrs. Clinton . The campaign did not say if Mr. Trump paid federal income taxes in the years since 1996 , although it claimed he paid millions of dollars in various taxes .\n\u201c Mr . Trump \u2019 s a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business , his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required , \u201d the campaign said in a statement . \u201c That being said , Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes , sales and excise taxes , real estate taxes , city taxes , state taxes , employee taxes and federal taxes , along with very substantial charitable contributions . Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it . \u201d\nThe tax bill issue is tricky for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton .\nIt is an open question whether getting out of paying taxes is smart . But Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s allegations also fall flat .\nAnti-tax crusader Grover Norquist refused to agree that avoiding paying taxes was smart . But he insisted that the criticism from Mrs. Clinton was both illegitimate and dishonest .\n\u201c The implication is that he \u2019 s not paying taxes he owes . I assure you the IRS actually cares about that stuff , and if there was even a hint of that , they \u2019 d have been all over him . That \u2019 s not the case , \u201d said Mr. Norquist , founder and president of low-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform .\n\u201c One of the problems with the income tax is it violates people \u2019 s privacy vis-a-vis the government , and the idea that anybody should open up their personal finances to the government is ridiculous , \u201d he said . \u201c The IRS has all of his stuff . If there was anything wrong , the IRS under this administration would have gone after him a long time ago . \u201d\nAccountants who make a living navigating tax laws said the same thing . Bibi Rudstedt , secretary of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Tax Professionals , Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s accusation lacked merit .\n\u201c Of course everyone pays taxes . I \u2019 m sure Mr. Trump pays taxes because , with his income , he must have AMT tax on everything , \u201d she said , referring to the alternative minimum tax that the federal government imposes on the wealthy to prevent them from finding loopholes in tax law .\nMrs. Rudstedt , who has practiced tax accounting with her husband for 25 years in Spring Hill , Florida , bristled at the former secretary of state \u2019 s allegation that Mr. Trump weaseled out of paying taxes .\n\u201c I think she is stupid because she should know more . A man with that kind of income must pay taxes , \u201d said Mrs. Rudstedt , a Trump supporter . \u201c I don \u2019 t know where she got that from . \u201d\nRefusing to say it was \u201c smart \u201d to avoid paying taxes , Mrs. Rudstedt said that dodging taxes wasn \u2019 t the goal in her accounting office .\n\u201c Everybody has to pay his own share , \u201d she said . \u201c We don \u2019 t want them to overpay . But it is important that you claim the deductions you have . If you don \u2019 t have any deductions , that \u2019 s too bad . But I mean those are the things we have to help people with . \u201d\nMr. Norquist \u2019 s nonprofit organization does not endorse candidates .
