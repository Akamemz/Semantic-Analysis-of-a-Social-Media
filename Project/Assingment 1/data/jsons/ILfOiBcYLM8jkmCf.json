The US is the center of the pandemic , with the most reported cases and confirmed fatalities .\nAs of Thursday , there were well over 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US , alongside more than 61,000 deaths . For perspective , the number of Americans who have died from the coronavirus in a matter of weeks is greater than the death toll of US service members in the Vietnam War , which the US was directly involved in for nearly a decade . What 's more , recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the US death toll from the coronavirus is much higher than the official count .\nMeanwhile , about 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the past six weeks as the US economy continues to plummet because of the pandemic and its restrictions .\nAs the crisis has worsened in the US , Trump 's polling numbers have also taken a nosedive .\nAn Emerson College Polling national survey released on Tuesday showed that Trump 's job-approval rating dropped 5 percentage points since March , from 46 to 41 % , while approval of the president 's handling of the coronavirus dropped a whopping 10 percentage points , from 49 to 39 % .\nAn NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Wednesday showed a majority of respondents ( 55 % ) disapproved of Trump 's handling of the pandemic , which marked a 6-point increase in disapproval over the past month .\nAnd Morning Consult polling released on Monday showed that since it reached a high point in mid-March , net approval of the president 's handling of COVID-19 ( the disease caused by the novel coronavirus ) hit a new low and dropped 22 points . Overall , a majority of respondents who identified as voters ( 51 % ) disapproved of Trump 's coronavirus response , the poll showed , while 43 % approved . The survey was conducted between April 24 and April 26 , the days that followed Trump 's controversial , dangerous suggestion that disinfectant or sunlight could be injected or used `` inside the body '' to combat the coronavirus .\nIn contrast to Trump , the Morning Consult survey showed that seven in 10 voters approved of their state and local governments ' response to the virus .\nSimilarly , a massive survey of 22,000 Americans conducted by researchers at Harvard , Northeastern University , and Rutgers University , showed respondents in all 50 states approved of their governors ' handling of the coronavirus pandemic more highly than Trump .

Mike DeWine of Ohio has been praised across the country for the early steps he took to protect his state from the coronavirus , such as being the first governor to close schools , and his constituents evidently appreciate his handling of the crisis as well . While Trump has pushed for states to reopen to get the economy going , DeWine has closely followed the advice of public-health experts and championed a more cautious approach .\nA Baldwin Wallace University poll conducted in Ohio and released on Monday showed only 43 % of respondents in the state had a favorable view of Trump , while 75 % of them had a favorable view of DeWine .\nThe poll also found about half the respondents approved of Trump 's handling of COVID-19 , while a whopping 85 % said they approved of DeWine 's approach to the virus . And three in four respondents ( 75 % ) said DeWine was doing a better job at handling COVID-19 than Trump .\nDeWine , who also broke from Trump by encouraging mail-in voting amid the pandemic , has seen a much bigger polling bump than Republican governors , like Ron DeSantis of Florida , who tend to take their cues from the president . The Florida governor has been widely criticized as being too slow to respond to the pandemic and too quick to reopen and ease restrictions .\nA FiveThirtyEight analysis of polling on governors in the final quarter of 2019 versus polling on their handling of COVID-19 showed that the Florida governor 's prepandemic numbers were stronger , but the leaders of other states ( including many Democratic governors ) saw double-digit surges in approval in their approach to the crisis .
