It is , after all , arguably the most political of U.S. holidays . It commemorates a political act \u2013 the signing of the Declaration of Independence . At its beginning in 1776 , New York City residents tore down an equestrian statue of King George III and hacked it to pieces .\nAt various points in history , the Fourth has been a day for divisive political expression . It has not always been a relaxed entrance to high summer , a time of hot dogs , bottle rockets , and all things red , white , and blue .\nThe holiday shows how Black and white Americans , immigrants and the native-born , have over decades battled over the meaning of freedom and to whom it applies , says Blain Roberts , a history professor at California State University , Fresno , and co-author of \u201c Denmark Vesey \u2019 s Garden : Slavery and Memory in the Cradle of the Confederacy . \u201d\n\u201c In that way , the Fourth of July is really a window into that long political struggle about what it means to be an American , \u201d Dr. Roberts says .\nIn the sweep of national history , many Black Americans have had different attitudes toward the Fourth of July than their white counterparts .\n\u201c To be clear , Fourth of July means different things to different people , and so does \u2018 Americanness \u2019 depending on the color one \u2018 wears \u2019 , \u201d says Soji Akomolafe , chair of political science at Norfolk State University , an HBCU ( historically black college or university ) .\nWhen white America gained independence in 1776 , Black America remained persona non grata , Dr. Akomolafe says .\nBefore the Civil War , the basic reason for this split was obvious : the glaring hypocrisy between the Declaration \u2019 s words \u201c all men are created equal \u201d and the reality of the existence of slavery .\nThis was eloquently expressed in Frederick Douglass \u2019 s famous 1852 address to the Ladies \u2019 Anti-Slavery Society of Rochester , New York . Speaking , pointedly , on July 5 , Douglass asked , \u201c What to the Slave is the Fourth of July ? \u201d and answered : \u201c The Fourth of July is yours , not mine . You may rejoice , I must mourn . \u201d\nWhat Douglass was trying to do in his speech was point out that the Fourth isn \u2019 t just a celebration of American food and fireworks and freedom , says Keidrick Roy , a doctoral candidate in American literature and intellectual history at Harvard University .\n\u201c For Douglass , the Fourth of July is a time for us to reflect , and to be critical about ourselves and how we reflect on our institutions that govern us , \u201d says Mr. Roy .\nDouglass points out the ideals of the Declaration and the Constitution are things to which we should aspire , Mr. Roy adds .\n\u201c And what we see now in America conflicts with those ideals . So we need to endeavor to reconcile that contradiction , \u201d he says .\nElizabeth Johnson Rice was a civil rights activist starting in her college days , when she was a member of the Richmond 34 \u2013 a group of students who sat-in at an all-white lunch counter in Richmond in 1960 . They were one of the first mass arrests of the civil rights era and helped lead to the city \u2019 s desegregation .\n\u201c The founding fathers at the time [ of the Declaration of Independence ] really weren \u2019 t thinking about me , \u201d she says .\n\u201c They were looking at us like chattel . They weren \u2019 t looking at us like human beings when this whole thing was drafted , \u201d she adds .\nRemembering the Fourth only in the red-white-and-blue imagery of tricorn hats and bewigged signers of the Declaration focuses too little on the contributions of Black Americans , who weren \u2019 t treated equally at the time yet whose labor still was a backbone of the country \u2019 s growth , says Ms. Rice-Johnson .\nIronically , there was a short period in U.S. history when , in the South in particular , the Fourth of July was a true Black holiday .\nThe Civil War \u2019 s outcome flipped attitudes around . Defeated white Confederates did not want to celebrate the Union . Meanwhile , African Americans embraced it as a symbol of the new order .\nThey gathered in small towns and big cities to picnic , hear orators read the Emancipation Proclamation and the Declaration of Independence , and see fireworks , says Ethan Kytle , a California State University , Fresno , historian and co-author with spouse Dr. Roberts of \u201c Denmark Vesey \u2019 s Garden , \u201d which recounts some of these celebrations .\nThe most elaborate took place in Charleston , South Carolina . Black militia units with names like the \u201c Douglass Light Infantry \u201d marched through the streets of a city known as the capital of Southern slavery . They ended at White Point Garden , a park at the base of the Charleston peninsula .\n\u201c African Americans felt for the first time that it was a holiday that included them , \u201d says Dr. Kytle .\nBut white Southerners resented the celebrations . Beginning in the 1880s they pushed back , reclaiming local political power as Reconstruction waned , and then passing ordinances restricting the Black gatherings . Eventually Southern whites stripped Black Americans of citizenship in all but name .\nBy the turn of the century , Fourth of July celebrations in the South were white affairs that would pair renditions of \u201c Dixie \u201d with the \u201c Star-Spangled Banner. \u201d In the Jim Crow era , cities erected many memorials to Confederate soldiers \u2013 the same memorials that protesters are toppling today .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not that Black people aren \u2019 t patriotic . They have a different sense and understanding of what that means and how we want to express and celebrate that , \u201d says Hasan Kwame Jeffries , a historian at The Ohio State University and author of \u201c Bloody Lowndes : Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama \u2019 s Black Belt. \u201d \u201c Here \u2019 s the thing . Black people have a blood investment in the nation , in the soil , in the land . People recognize that , \u2018 This is my country , \u2019 but what does it mean to not be a full citizen in this country ? That limits the real joyousness of the Fourth of July . \u201d\nU.S. presidents have long used July Fourth as a means to promote their particular visions of what being an American means .\nIn 1964 , for instance , Lyndon Baines Johnson pointedly signed the Civil Rights Act on July 2 , the actual date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence .\n\u201c One hundred eighty-eight years ago this week , a small band of valiant men began a struggle for freedom , \u201d President Johnson said in a nationally-televised speech from the White House . \u201c Yet those who founded America knew that freedom would be secure only if each generation fought to renew and enlarge its meaning . \u201d\nAP/File President Lyndon B. Johnson reaches to shake hands with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after presenting the civil rights leader with one of the 72 pens used to sign the Civil Rights Act in Washington on July 2 , 1964 .

Peter Rodino , D-N.J. , Dr. King , Emanuel Celler , D-N.Y. , and behind Celler is Whitney Young , executive director of the National Urban League .\nEight years later , with the country riven by protests against the Vietnam War , Richard Nixon and conservative supporters organized a giant \u201c Honor America Day \u201d for July Fourth on the Washington Mall . Evangelist Billy Graham gave the keynote address . Comedian Bob Hope served as co-host of the entertainment .\nBut the day didn \u2019 t end as planned . It attracted droves of protesters , some of whom stripped naked and cooled off in the Reflecting Pool . To keep them at bay , the Park Police eventually resorted to tear gas , which blew back and wafted over the celebration itself as the Navy Band wrapped up with \u201c The Star-Spangled Banner . \u201d\nIn recent years , President Donald Trump has used the holiday to invoke symbols of military strength and national grandeur .\nIn 2019 , he headlined a \u201c Salute to America \u201d event with a speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial , accompanied by military band performances , a military flyover , and a fireworks display . According to a recently-released General Accounting Office Report , the event cost about $ 13 million , double that of previous years .\nFor 2020 , the president opted for the sweeping stage of Mount Rushmore , where on July 3 he is scheduled to give remarks and attend a firework display in front of sculptor Gutzon Borglum \u2019 s giant carved faces of George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , Theodore Roosevelt , and Abraham Lincoln . On July Fourth he will host this year \u2019 s \u201c Salute to America \u201d from the White House South Lawn and the Ellipse . It will include music , military demonstrations , and a flyover of military aircraft along the East Coast from Boston to D.C .\nTypically , presidents use patriotic holidays like the Fourth of July to reaffirm communal values \u2013 to remind us what being American entails and how our national values serve the greater good in the U.S. and around the world , says Jennifer Mercieca , a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A & M and author of \u201c Demagogue for President : The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump . \u201d\nPresident Trump has famously shown little interest in acting the role of a traditional , unifying U.S. chief executive . His version of July 4 showmanship , says Dr. Mercieca in an email , seems to define American exceptionalism as \u201c winning \u201d \u2013 depicting the nation as a first-class military and economic power , as opposed to a symbol of liberty and justice for the world .\nThe majestic backdrops are meant to link President Trump to his greatest predecessors , she says . He \u2019 s like Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial . He \u2019 s like Washington , Jefferson , et al , at Mount Rushmore .\n\u201c It \u2019 s convenient staging that is meant to bolster Trump \u2019 s claims to being American exceptionalism personified , \u201d says Dr. Mercieca .\nHas President Trump politicized national July Fourth celebrations ? Critics complain that his recent predecessors didn \u2019 t make themselves the keynote speaker of the Washington celebrations . D.C. residents bemoan the loss of what used to be a relaxing local break from politics \u2013 a concert on the Mall , followed by spectacular fireworks , with nary a partisan word to be heard from the podium .\n\u201c This is a show of pageantry , and it really is not getting down to the root of the issues for the minority communities , the Black and brown communities that are suffering indiscriminately and unequally due to COVID-19 , and to all of the unjust murders of people of color , \u201d says Dr. Sharlene Sinegal-DeCuir , department chair and associate professor of history at Xavier University of Louisiana . \u201c That \u2019 s a really , really big thing . \u201d\nBut in a basic sense , the celebrations around July Fourth really have always been political , notes David Waldstreicher , a historian of early America at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York . The question , he says , is which vision of American citizenship it \u2019 s being used to advance .\nPresident Trump , for his part , has charged that the current push to remove Confederate memorials is , in its own way , a politicization of American history . On Wednesday , the president went so far as to threaten to veto the annual defense authorization bill if it includes a provision that would lead to the renaming of Fort Bragg and other U.S. military bases that bear Confederate names .\nOn this issue Dr. Waldstreicher points back to the original July Fourth , when stripping the new nation of the symbols of its old colonial overlords , such as statues of the English king , was a part of , indeed central to , the meaning of the day .\n\u201c Nothing is more American than tearing down statues in the name of the people \u2019 s right to decide what is an apt symbol of popular rule , \u201d he says in an email . \u201c In that sense , even with some accompanying flag-burnings , every day is the Fourth of July . \u201d\nIndeed , protests might be as much a Fourth of July celebration as picnics .\n\u201c Freedom is never given , it \u2019 s always demanded , \u201d says novelist Tina McElroy Ansa of St. Simons Island , Georgia , talking about this particular moment in American race relations . \u201c We are not asking the government for something .
