Indeed , many Democrats waiting for him in Philadelphia express ambivalence over whether he \u2019 s had a significant political legacy at all .\nObama and his aides will make correcting that deficiency their main electoral project for the fall \u2014 starting with putting the full force of his coalition behind Hillary Clinton in a Democratic National Convention speech Wednesday that will be less about him and mostly about her .\nObama \u2019 s preparing a major run of endorsements and campaign stops for statehouse candidates , trying to foster an Obama generation on his way out the door . He \u2019 s throwing himself into fundraising , starting Monday with an event for Clinton in Atlanta and with more events being approved weekly . And he \u2019 s preparing to compensate for a September that will be mostly consumed by a long trip to Asia and days in New York around the United Nations General Assembly by doing more email and video events than ever before .\nThe White House is beginning to plan an October filled with nearly nonstop political travel on behalf of both Clinton \u2014 whose campaign aides have in recent months expanded the list of places where they believe he could be helpful \u2014 and Senate candidates . Obama \u2019 s team is even considering doing some travel specifically on behalf of House candidates .\nClinton , after all , isn \u2019 t just running on Obama \u2019 s popularity and his agenda more than she ever expected to . She \u2019 s running on his map and on his blueprint for winning voters : shifting away from the chunk of voters they \u2019 d been fighting Republicans for over decades and instead reaching new ones never before pressed .\nIt happened eight years ago out of necessity , when there weren \u2019 t enough existing Democratic votes to beat Clinton in the primaries . But the lasting effect of activating more African-Americans , Latinos , young voters and first-time voters solidified a realignment of a Democratic Party that is defined by the Obama mind-set : cosmopolitan and oriented toward shedding the baggage of the past , trying to catch up to cultural shifts occurring outside the political mainstream .\n\u201c Barack Obama \u2019 s presidency has ushered in a new era of diversity , and conversations are taking place not just in government , but throughout business , throughout media and throughout both parties , \u201d said Rep.
