Martha McSally , the first female fighter pilot to fly in combat , disclosed during an emotional Senate hearing on Wednesday she was `` preyed upon and then raped '' in the Air Force by a superior officer .\nThe Arizona Republican , who served 26 years in the Air Force , made the disclosure during a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations in the military . McSally said she did n't report the assault because she did n't trust the system , and was ashamed and confused .\n\u201c My drive to fight against sexual assault in the ranks is not from the outside looking in , '' McSally began . `` And it is deeply personal . ''\nMcSally said that during her military career , she was `` greatly privileged to prepare and then lead my amazing Airmen in combat , which is the apex responsibility of any warrior leader . ''\nBut , McSally added that she had also `` witnessed so many weaknesses in the processes involving sexual assault prevention , investigation , and adjudication , '' which motivated her `` to make recommendations to Air Force leaders , shaped my approach as a commander , and informed my advocacy for change while I remained in the military and since I have been in Congress . ''\nThen McSally revealed her own experience with abuse -- as she said she would use her `` voice and unique experience to work on this mission to stop military sexual assault for good . ''\n`` I am so inspired by the many survivors who found the strength to share their stories , report their assaults , and demand accountability , justice , and change , '' McSally said . `` It is because of you that a light has been shined on this silent epidemic and so many improvements have been made\u2014including more than 100 legislative actions over the last decade\u2014on all aspects of military sexual assault .
