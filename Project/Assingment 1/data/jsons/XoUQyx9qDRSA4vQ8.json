    "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Hillary Clinton sat in a locker room in the bowels of the Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday night , watching President Barack Obama make the case for passing her the baton .\nWith her longtime aides Huma Abedin and Capricia Marshall by her side , she grew emotional watching her onetime rival bring down the hall \u2014 at one point placing her hand over her chest as she watched .\nGone from the convention floor were the pro-Bernie Sanders protesters who had disrupted speakers on the opening day of the convention . The \u201c Not For Sale ! \u201d chants were replaced with exclamations of \u201c We Love You ; \u201d the anti-TPP signs overwhelmed in a sea of \u201c Yes We Can \u201d posters distributed to delegates on the floor \u2014 Obama \u2019 s famous 2008 rallying cry , now printed in the Clinton campaign \u2019 s official font , a customized version of Sharp Sans entitled , appropriately , \u201c Unity . \u201d\nBut the picture of an optimistic , unified party didn \u2019 t just happen on its own . Sure , by Day 4 , the Democratic National Convention would look smooth , expertly choreographed and far more effectively produced than the Republican programming a week earlier . But that was the result of days of negotiating and wrangling with Bernie Sanders , adjusting the schedule and creating opportunities to publicly make peace between the party \u2019 s rival factions .\nThe Clinton campaign began planning for the convention in April after winning the New York primary . They hired Ricky Kirschner , a nine-time Emmy Award-winning producer whose credits include the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show starring Beyonc\u00e9 , the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show starring Katy Perry , as well as Obama \u2019 s 2012 convention . The campaign \u2019 s top consultants , Jim Margolis , Mandy Grunwald and Joel Benenson , all experienced at running conventions , were tasked with the run of show , intro videos and speaker lineup .\nThe Sanders campaign was in a convention state of mind early , too . In March , Sanders adviser Mark Longabaugh told convention CEO Leah Daughtry the senator \u2019 s team would want a boiler room , the nerve center from which the nominee \u2019 s staff would traditionally oversee the show . Daughtry didn \u2019 t understand the request : The nominee \u2019 s team would be in charge , she said . Longabaugh \u2019 s response was unsettling for Democrats : What if there \u2019 s a contested convention , he asked .\nClinton \u2019 s chief administration officer , Charlie Baker , reached out to Longabaugh . Brooklyn wasn \u2019 t going to fight . Instead , Clinton \u2019 s team offered Sanders shared access to the boiler room . The Clinton team had realized it would have to accommodate more demands from the Sanders camp than it had bargained for if it wanted the certainty of a smooth program .\nAs Baker worked out the logistics with the Sanders campaign , three separate teams inside Clinton \u2019 s Brooklyn headquarters were crafting suggested themes for the convention . Independently , each settled on the same one \u2014 \u201c Stronger Together. \u201d It was an odd moment of consensus for a campaign that spends hours debating issues large and small . So when the three teams dialed into a conference call to discuss the convention message , it was a short discussion ; team members joked that they didn \u2019 t know what to do when they agree .\nAfter the California primary on June 7 , the Clinton campaign team began convention planning in earnest . They intended to create two plans . One assumed Sanders would endorse Clinton before the convention and be awarded a major speaking role on opening night . That was Plan A .\nPlan B would be one that Brooklyn would activate if Sanders didn \u2019 t endorse . \u201c We never really got to Plan B , \u201d admitted a campaign source involved with the planning .\nWhen the two teams arrived in Philadelphia the Friday before the convention , the Clinton team already knew it would have problems with Sanders \u2019 supporters . And that was even before news broke that Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been working against the senator from Vermont .\nClinton \u2019 s convention planners met with the Sanders team at the Sonesta Hotel , and they found his aides willing to help quell the expected floor insurgency . Together , they created a joint whip operation to keep the floor under control \u2014 each state delegation was assigned a Sanders official and a Clinton official to talk down dissenters . Sanders \u2019 former Iowa state director , Robert Becker , was the main point person on the floor to explain to angry protesters why Sanders had chosen to back Clinton .\nBut they weren \u2019 t as quick to find consensus on Sanders \u2019 speaking slot . The Clinton campaign had scheduled Sanders to take the stage at 9 p.m. \u2014 not only before the coveted 10 p.m. hour but as a warm-up act for Elizabeth Warren and Michelle Obama , and even Paul Simon .\nSanders wasn \u2019 t having it , according to sources inside his camp . Sure , Paul Simon was alright \u2014 it was Simon \u2019 s idea to have \u201c Bridge Over Troubled Waters \u201d play as Sanders wrapped\u2014 but after giving a full-throated endorsement of a rival he knew had the unfair advantage of a party establishment working the levers in her favor , he wanted the primo speaking slot .\nWhen the teams met again on Sunday night at the Wells Fargo Center , Clinton \u2019 s aides agreed to give Sanders what he wanted . And they made another concession : After originally cutting former NAACP president Ben Jealous , a vocal Sanders surrogate , from the main stage , Clinton \u2019 s team bowed to Sanders \u2019 demand that he be added back to the program .\nThere was one Sanders surrogate who wouldn \u2019 t get past Clinton \u2019 s convention gatekeepers , though \u2014 former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner , who has been highly critical of Clinton throughout the campaign after initially endorsing her . Clinton \u2019 s team denied Sanders \u2019 request that Turner nominate him on Tuesday .\nThroughout the week , Margolis and Grunwald reviewed every word entered into the teleprompter from their small room in the basement of the arena . They were also on ego patrol , balancing the needs of politicians and Hollywood stars , paring down the speeches to make sure the convention stayed on schedule \u2014 and on message .\nTeam Sanders , meanwhile , was managing its own delegates , texting them to be respectful with a message from campaign manager Jeff Weaver after they revolted against Sanders in a Monday morning event .\nOn Monday night , however , the Clinton camp \u2019 s careful control over the program hit a road bump . Sanders \u2019 operatives wouldn \u2019 t hand over his speech , which they said he was still writing until the last moment . Weaver and Longabaugh tried to calm them down . \u201c You will like the speech , \u201d they promised .\nHillary Clinton 's acceptance speech at the 2016 DNC Hillary Clinton accepted the nomination for the candidate for the Democratic party on Thursday at the 2016 Democratic National Convention . poster= '' http : //v.\u2588\u2588\u2588.com/images/1155968404/201607/3095/1155968404_5061836388001_5060493938001-vs.jpg ? pubId=1155968404 ''\nClinton \u2019 s aides had nothing to worry about .
