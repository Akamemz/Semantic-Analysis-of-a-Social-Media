There is mounting evidence that a prominent Saudi journalist , Jamal Khashoggi , was murdered in Turkey by a Saudi hit squad . The Trump administration \u2019 s reaction to the case was criticized as being delayed , but the allegations have spawned a bipartisan call from Congress for sanctions to be imposed on Saudi Arabia if it turns out Mr. Khashoggi was indeed killed by Saudi operatives . President Trump \u201c has a longstanding position that he doesn \u2019 t care very much about internal affairs \u2013 \u2018 How you run your country is up to you \u2019 is how he likes to put it \u2013 so I would assume that would be his impulse in this case , \u201d says Patrick Clawson , an expert in US-Saudi relations . Others say what is already known about Khashoggi \u2019 s disappearance is enough to trigger some action . \u201c I can \u2019 t imagine the outcome is going to be no change , \u201d says Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . \u201c But the outcome is not going to be the US ending its close relationship with Saudi Arabia , \u201d either , he adds . \u201c It will be a calibrated approach that will be criticized as inadequate by some people . \u201d\nEver since President Trump accepted the counsel of son-in-law and Middle East adviser Jared Kushner to make Saudi Arabia the first foreign trip of his presidency , it was clear that the kingdom was to be the linchpin of his administration \u2019 s regional policy .\nFrom countering Iran and achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace to promoting sustainable reforms of rigid Arab societies , Saudi Arabia under its young crown prince ( and de facto leader ) Mohammed bin Salman would be Washington \u2019 s go-to partner in the region .\nNow the Saudi strategy Mr. Kushner engineered has been rattled and indeed threatens to come crashing down .\nThe reason ? The stunning allegations \u2013 which Mr. Trump this week hinted are likely more fact than accusation \u2013 that a prominent Saudi journalist and US resident , Jamal Khashoggi , was murdered in Turkey by a Saudi government hit squad dispatched by the crown prince .\nMr. Khashoggi \u2019 s disappearance Oct. 2 while with Saudi officials in Turkey has prompted little in the way of clarifying information from the Saudis . But it has spawned vociferous reaction from rights groups and a bipartisan call from Congress for answers \u2013 and for sanctions to be imposed on Saudi Arabia if it turns out Khashoggi was indeed killed by Saudi operatives .\nTrump , too , has expressed his disapproval of Khashoggi \u2019 s disappearance \u2013 although it took the White House more than a week to comment on the case . That delay , as well as the president \u2019 s stated reluctance to take punitive action , suggests to some regional analysts that any rough period ahead for US-Saudi relations could be short-lived .\n\u201c This president has a longstanding position that he doesn \u2019 t care very much about internal affairs \u2013 \u2018 How you run your country is up to you \u2019 is how he likes to put it \u2013 so I would assume that would be his impulse in this case , \u201d says Patrick Clawson , an expert in US-Saudi relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .\n\u201c Reflecting that , the US position toward the Saudis is going to be that \u2018 This [ the Khashoggi affair ] is not good for your interests , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Clawson adds . \u201c It \u2019 s not going to be that this is a moral outrage that calls into question our relations or that outweighs our common interests . \u201d\nOthers say the facts of the case will determine the US response , but that what is already known about Khashoggi \u2019 s disappearance is enough to trigger some action .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t imagine the outcome is going to be no change , based on the unrefuted pattern of facts \u201d already established , says Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) in Washington and a former special assistant to the State Department \u2019 s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs .\n\u201c But the outcome is not going to be the US ending its close relationship with Saudi Arabia , \u201d either , he adds . \u201c It will be a calibrated approach that will be criticized as inadequate by some people . \u201d\nKashoggi \u2019 s last verified whereabouts was the Saudi consulate in Istanbul , where his fianc\u00e9e says he made an appointment to get documents for their upcoming wedding .

On Thursday , Turkish officials claimed to have audio and video tapes of Kashoggi \u2019 s interrogation , torture , and murder in the consulate .\nUS intelligence officials confirm that over recent weeks they had picked up chatter among Saudi officials discussing a plan to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and then to detain him , as first reported by the Washington Post .\nThat information raised questions about whether Khashoggi was informed of the plan concerning him \u2013 US intelligence agencies operate under a \u201c duty to warn \u201d individuals of such intercepted plots , even if the individual is not an American citizen .\nKhashoggi , a Washington Post columnist , was no radical anti-regime dissident but rather a Saudi insider who gradually soured on the royal court \u2014 and in particular on the crown prince .\nAnd senior Trump administration officials have lent credence to the darkest conjectures about Khashoggi .
