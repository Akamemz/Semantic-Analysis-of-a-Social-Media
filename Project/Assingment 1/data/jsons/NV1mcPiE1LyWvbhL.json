    "content": "I grew up in a tight-knit family in Texas . My dad had lots of brothers and sisters , I had dozens of cousins . Weekends and holidays were spent with our relatives playing horseshoes , dominoes , softball , cooking and fishing . I knew where my aunts kept their measuring cups and where my uncles kept their horseshoe sets . We were all pretty close . Time has sent us all in many directions and most of our aunts and uncles are gone now , including my father . At our recent reunion in July in Texas , my shrinking and aging family sweated in front of box fans , barbecued in the heat , drank beer , cackled and caught up with each other . We shared pictures and sweaty hugs and no one discussed politics .\nAt my youngest uncle \u2019 s request , I made the rounds at the reunion gathering everyone \u2019 s email address so we could all stay in better touch . I interrupted each relative \u2019 s gabbing and eating to write their email address down on the damp , sweaty paper . Dutifully I delivered the list to my uncle . I may be 56 , but I am a niece and do what I \u2019 m told by my aunts and uncles . We all left the reunion with smiling promises to keep in better touch via email or snail mail , and get together again next year .\nGrowing up , uncles were an extension of my gentleman father . Uncles chased me , hit balls with me , complimented and teased me . While my aunts fed me popsicles and tended to my wasp stings and bloody knees , my uncles knew I was tough and teased me about my tomboy abilities . They liked it that I baited my own hooks , went seining for hellgrammites with the boys and could catch their fly balls in the outfield with my bare hands . While the last living brother whose name means `` bully '' looks more like my dad every day , the extension of my father stops there .\nAfter the reunion I began receiving political emails from this uncle . The emails were sent -- you guessed it -- to those on the list I gathered at the reunion , and to others whom I do not know . The content of the emails were angry , hateful , bitter , spiteful , and full of the typical Tea Party rhetoric seemingly so common among uneducated white men from rural counties . I was reminded in these emails , again and again , that `` Obama is a constitution shredding Muslim and is destroying our country ! \u201d After receiving several of these hateful emails , and after getting more of the same from people I did not know , I `` replied to all '' asking to be removed from the mailing list . My exact and only words were , \u201c Please remove me from this mailing list , thank you . \u201d\nMy uncle-that-I-recently-hugged emailed me back and angrily expressed his incredulity to my request . His anger took me by surprise as I read comments such as \u2026 I must have wanted to get back at him . I must not want to know the truth about our country . I should know that his friends on the mailing list had not-so-kind things to say about me . I drank the entire pitcher of Obama Kool-Aid . I should also know that he has opinions about non-Christian abortion-loving gay marriage-supporting liberals and that is , we are doomed to hell . Therefore , he will never email me again on any matter , will never speak to me again , and can not pray for me because I can not be a liberal and a Christian at the same time . He promised to not waste his time praying for me or ever speak to me again .\nExcuse me ? So , at the next funeral ( a family reunion if there ever was one ) , he will not acknowledge me ? He will shun me as he passes out bulletins ? Ignore me over the white bread pimento cheese sandwiches served at each and every funeral by the Lutheran ladies ?\nI wasn \u2019 t aware of his political leanings , but assumed that he and most of my older relatives share a similar conservative viewpoint . I also assumed that since my deceased father and the other four deceased brothers were all gentlemen , that this last brother was a gentleman also . I have never mentioned my views or spoken to him about politics . I know better . What I didn \u2019 t know is that my father \u2019 s last living brother could turn on me in such a hateful manner . I couldn \u2019 t have been more benign in my request to be taken off the mailing list , and he couldn \u2019 t have been more hateful in his response . It \u2019 s as if one of my favorite aunts had a jar of homemade dill pickles that she refused to share with me because she heard I was a liberal .\nA man I looked up to has written me out of his life simply because we have different opinions . He has pronounced me unworthy . I don \u2019 t need his prayers , I don \u2019 t need his approval . I \u2019 m not sure I even want my uncle back . I do , however , want to be an unconditionally loved niece again . I wonder how common it is for nieces , nephews and cousins to find themselves the recipient of anger and hatred as a first response from Tea Party conservative relative ? Like ripping off a band-aid , when Tea Partyers refuse to enter a debate in good faith and turn on family members with uncalled for anger and hatred , nieces like me find themselves stripped of a family bond once thought unbreakable .",
