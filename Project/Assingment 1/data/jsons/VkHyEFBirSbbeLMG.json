    "content_original": "Pope Francis is arriving in the U.S. at a time when the faithful are facing broad challenges in court over the limits of religious liberty.\n\nFrom the administration\u2019s contraception mandate under Obamacare to the fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage, church-affiliated institutions and individuals are confronting litigation to compel them to carry out policies contrary to their religious beliefs.\n\nAt least 40 cases are working their way through the federal courts in which nonprofit organizations are seeking exemptions from the contraception mandate by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more instances of government efforts to impose policies that infringe on religious liberty of individuals,\u201d said Eric Baxter, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has two petitions pending before the Supreme Court challenging the Obamacare mandate on contraception. \u201cThe HHS mandate litigation is one example of that.\u201d\n\nAlthough the high court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage hasn\u2019t yet resulted in lawsuits against churches refusing to perform such unions, the decision is causing concern in several areas, from church-related schools that provide housing to married students, from lawsuits against bakeries and florists that refuse to do business for same-sex weddings and from churches facing higher insurance premiums in anticipation of litigation.\n\n\u201cIn the marriage context, we\u2019re seeing more and more cases of individuals trying to exercise their religious freedom bumping into other laws where the government is trying to restrict their ability to do that,\u201d Mr. Baxter said. \u201cFor the most part, religious organizations remain free to only participate in the religious ceremonies that they approve.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Pope Francis arrives in U.S., greeted by Obamas, enthusiastic crowd\n\nSome observers say the pope, with whom President Obama claims to hold a special relationship, shouldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to speak out in defense of religious liberty in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis is the time, right now,\u201d said Joseph Prud\u2019homme, director of the Institute for the Study of Religion, Politics, and Culture at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. \u201cI think it\u2019s an opportunity for the pope to speak clearly about the right of religious liberty in this country.\u201d\n\nFrom his behind-the-scenes role in brokering the restoration of diplomatic ties between Cuba and the U.S. to his issuing of an encyclical on the environment in June calling for renewable-fuel subsidies and energy efficiency, Francis has appeared to many to be on the same page with much of Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cHe has established a considerable bridge with the secular left with his encyclical on the environment,\u201d Mr. Prud\u2019homme said. \u201cAnd using that kind of bridge, he needs to now walk across it and say very clearly that the right of religious freedom needs to be guaranteed and the right of individuals to follow their conscience needs to be protected.\u201d\n\nFrancis addressed the issue of his ideological leanings Tuesday on the plane from Cuba, saying that while some glosses on his writings and words may have created a view that he is \u201ca little bit more left-leaning,\u201d such narratives are wrong.\n\n\u201cI am certain that I have never said anything beyond what is in the social doctrine of the church,\u201d he asserted, referring to more than 120 years of church criticism of the excesses of capitalism, repeated in various ways by every pope since Leo XIII\u2019s encyclical Rerum Novarum.\n\nWhite House aides said the president\u2019s meeting with the pope in the Oval Office on Wednesday will focus on their shared values and won\u2019t address policy specifics.\n\n\u201cTheir focus in the context of this meeting will not be about politics, not about specific policies, but rather about the kinds of values that both men have dedicated their lives to championing,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cThere is no plan or strategy that\u2019s been put in place to try to stage an event that will advance anybody\u2019s political agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Earnest, addressing the Islamic State\u2019s persecution of Christians in Syria and Iraq, said one of the values that Mr. Obama shares with Pope Francis \u201cis a commitment to religious liberty \u2014 standing up for the rights of religious minorities around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has long been a value that President Obama has prioritized,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether or not it was timed to coincide with the pope\u2019s arrival, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell gave a speech Tuesday at Howard University\u2019s College of Medicine on progress made under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Supreme Court is increasingly likely to take up one or more challenges to the Obamacare contraception mandate. A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled last week that forcing two Missouri organizations to offer contraceptive coverage to employees \u2014 even indirectly \u2014 would violate the groups\u2019 religious freedoms.\n\nEvery other appeals court to consider the issue has ruled in opposition to the 8th Circuit, and the Supreme Court usually steps in to resolve such splits. The other courts have said the administration has done enough to accommodate the objections of religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations such as universities, hospitals and charities.\n\nThe Becket Fund\u2019s petitions to the high court involve the Little Sisters of the Poor and Houston Baptist University, both of which are challenging the mandate on religious grounds. The court is expected to decide in October whether to hear one or more of the cases.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unlikely that the court would refuse to address the issue, which is affecting hundreds if not thousands of religious organizations across the country,\u201d Mr. Baxter said.\n\n\u201cThe administration shouldn\u2019t be picking and choosing between religious organizations. The bishops who run the dioceses around the country have been exempted from the mandate, there\u2019s no reason why the nuns, like Little Sisters of the Poor, or other religious organizations shouldn\u2019t also be exempt,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
