    "content": "President Donald Trump wants voters to believe that Republicans are the party protecting Americans with preexisting conditions . But in bills , lawsuits , and regulations , they \u2019 ve worked to do the very opposite .\nTrump \u2019 s own administration imposed new rules just last week that would make it easier for insurance providers to discriminate against sick consumers .\nOn the same day news broke about the change , Trump didn \u2019 t even blink as he told an audience he held the exact opposite view . \u201c We will always protect Americans with preexisting conditions , \u201d he said at an event in Philadelphia earlier this month .\nRepublican candidates have followed Trump \u2019 s lead . Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley is telling voters that he supports \u201c forcing insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions . \u201d\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : It isn \u2019 t true . Republicans are lying about their position on preexisting conditions , and voters have a right to know that .\nCoverage for preexisting conditions matters to Americans . The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that it is the most important health care issue in this election . For 14 percent of Americans , it is the \u201c single most important \u201d factor in their vote .\nWe know Republicans do not support forcing insurance providers to cover patients with preexisting conditions because they spent most of 2017 trying to roll back that part of Obamacare .\nWe know Trump definitely does not want to uphold regulations on preexisting conditions because his administration has asked a federal court in Texas to throw those protections out .\nRepublicans aren \u2019 t telling the truth about their position because their actual position , it turns out , isn \u2019 t very popular . Americans like the idea of making sure sick people have access to health insurance .\nWith just over a week left until the midterm elections , Americans deserve to know the truth : Republicans support policies that would make it harder to for sick people to get health insurance .\nThere are some policy debates where it \u2019 s difficult to figure out where different candidates stand . For example , I don \u2019 t know what every candidate really means when they say they support \u201c Medicare-for-All. \u201d The term is shorthand for a universal coverage system , but what that system looks like exactly can vary .\nThe debate over preexisting conditions isn \u2019 t like that . It is a debate where we have lots and lots of evidence of where Trump and others stand .\nTrump has repeatedly supported legislation , regulations , and lawsuits to make it harder for sick people to get health insurance .\nMost obviously , he backed Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act , replacing it with the American Health Care Act . That bill would have reopened the door for insurers to charge sick people higher premiums \u2014 and to stop covering the health law \u2019 s essential health benefits , a requirement in Obamacare that made sure more insurance plans covered more of the basics .\nLess publicly , the Trump administration has pushed forward regulations that will drive up premiums for sicker Americans . He has widened the availability of skimpy \u201c short-term \u201d plans that are allowed to not cover prescription drugs , maternity benefits , or people with preexisting conditions .\nBut perhaps Trump \u2019 s most brazen move is supporting a lawsuit that would eliminate Obamacare \u2019 s preexisting condition protections completely . The Trump administration has filed a brief in federal court arguing that these protections are unconstitutional and ought to be thrown out completely .\nLet that sink in for just a moment . President Trump is tweeting things like , \u201c All Republicans support people with preexisting conditions. \u201d But that is just not the position of his White House , full stop . If the federal court sides with the Trump administration , protections for Americans with preexisting conditions would cease to exist .\nThe world that President Trump has pushed for \u2014 in federal regulations , in congressional legislation , in legal filings \u2014 is undeniably a world where it is harder for the Americans who need health insurance to get access to it .\nThe landscape , unfortunately , looks similar when you look at the claims of Republican congressional candidates .\nTake , for example , Hawley , the Missouri Senate candidate . He has run an ad with the following script :\nWe \u2019 ve got two perfect little boys . Just ask their mama . Earlier this year , we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease . Preexisting condition . We know what that \u2019 s like . I \u2019 m Josh Hawley . I support forcing insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions . And Claire McCaskill knows it . You deserve a senator who \u2019 s driven to fix this mess , not one who \u2019 s just trying to hang onto her office . And that \u2019 s why I approved this message .\nHere \u2019 s the thing Hawley \u2019 s ad doesn \u2019 t say : He is also party to the lawsuit aiming to overturn Obamacare \u2019 s preexisting condition protections . He is among 20 conservative attorneys general who brought that case to a federal court in Texas , the one the Trump administration has signed onto .\nHawley and the 19 other attorneys general could drop off that lawsuit at any moment . They could decide the threat to preexisting conditions is just too great . But nothing like that has happened . Instead , as Sam Stein at the Daily Beast notes , \u201c no Republican candidates have explicitly dropped their support for that same lawsuit or disavowed it either . \u201d\nWe have seen one effort on Capitol Hill to do damage control around this lawsuit . Ten Republican senators introduced a bill that would require insurers to cover Americans with preexisting conditions .\nThis sounds great \u2014 until you learn about one gigantic loophole : The insurance policy wouldn \u2019 t have to cover the preexisting condition itself . In other words : An insurer would have to offer a health insurance plan to a cancer patient , but that health plan could exclude her cancer treatment . This , as the end of the day , isn \u2019 t much protection for preexisting conditions at all .\nI saw this firsthand two years ago , when I went to Kentucky to write a story about Obamacare enrollees who voted for Trump . I asked a lot of voters : Why did you support the candidate who campaigned on getting rid of your health insurance ?\nI heard the same answer again and again : He promised that something better would come along .
