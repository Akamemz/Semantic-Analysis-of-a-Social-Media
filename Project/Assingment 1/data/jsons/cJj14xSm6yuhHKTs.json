Bernie Sanders , the Vermont independent , and Rep. Jeff Miller , a Florida Republican , have struck a deal that would provide $ 17 billion to the department to hire more doctors and nurses and build new facilities , and to make it easier to fire bumbling officials . These agreements can always fall apart , especially with both houses racing to get out of town for the rest of the summer , but the compromise is there for the taking .\nRemember when everyone in the media and political world was outraged at the VA mess ? When the country was shocked that some vets were dying while waiting long periods to get medical care , a situation covered up with bogus waiting lists ? When the drumbeat for Eric Shinseki \u2019 s head grew so loud that he finally had to go ? When we were all convinced that this scandal was different because it had such a heart-rending human dimension involving people who had risked their lives for our country ?\nThere is nothing quite like the adrenaline that courses through the media bloodstream like the fresh whiff of scandal . Front-page stories , live shots and cable debates dominate the news cycle . Every fresh tidbit of information is vacuumed up .

Partisans square off over the blame game : wasn \u2019 t this also a problem during the Bush administration ? And a rising chorus demands that someone take the fall .\nIn the VA \u2019 s case , the scandal fever peaked when the White House finally eased out Shinseki as the department \u2019 s secretary , even though that did nothing to solve the problems of an overcrowded and dysfunctional system . The story quickly petered out after that .\nInevitably , other stories erupted and filled the news hole . The tens of thousands of kids flooding across the border . The war between Israel and Hamas .
