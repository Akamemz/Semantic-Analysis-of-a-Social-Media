And they softened requirements that federal buildings phase out use of fossil fuels.\n\nWith the changes, Senators Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, built a coalition that included seven Republicans and seven Democrats as co-sponsors, and both the Natural Resources Defense Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAnd it still wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nDeep divisions on issues unrelated to the bill -- such as the Keystone XL pipeline and regulations on the coal industry -- doomed it yesterday.
