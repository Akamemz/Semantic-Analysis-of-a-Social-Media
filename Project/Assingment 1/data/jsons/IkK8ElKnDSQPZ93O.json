From this moment on , it \u2019 s going to be America First , \u201d he declared .\n\u201c I will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never , ever let you down . America will start winning again , winning like never before . \u201d\nAnd so it came to pass that America is indeed winning like never before . First among nations , to be sure . With all the new vision that an ostrich has while examining the sand from below .\nThe news that Donald Trump \u2019 s America is first in the world for coronavirus cases should give nobody any pleasure . The fact that the nation passed this grim milestone on the same day it reported a record number of unemployment claims \u2013 3.3 million in just one week \u2013 underscores the superlative nature of this presidency .\nHe represents the greatest , the biggest , and the most tremendous failure of leadership in living memory . He has made America great again in ways nobody could ever imagine or conceive .\nHow did Trump mark this date which will live in infamy ? By praising himself , of course . If he had been president at the time of Pearl Harbor , he would have claimed that the bombing was just confirmation that he had built the world \u2019 s greatest navy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a tribute to the amount of testing that we \u2019 re doing , \u201d he said on Thursday . \u201c We \u2019 re doing tremendous testing , and I \u2019 m sure you \u2019 re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing . I think that \u2019 s a little hard . \u201d\nTo be honest , it \u2019 s a little hard to tell what \u2019 s happening here too . As of Thursday evening , there have been 519,000 tests performed in the United States , among a population of 327 million . That \u2019 s 0.15 % of all Americans . In South Korea , with a population one-sixth of the size , they have performed more than 357,000 tests .\nOvertaking South Korea in total tests was of course a reason to celebrate in Trump \u2019 s very small book . It was also a reason to lie .\n\u201c Just reported that the United States has done far more \u2018 testing \u2019 than any other nation , by far ! \u201d he tweeted . \u201c In fact , over an eight day span , the United States now does more testing than what South Korea ( which has been a very successful tester ) does over an eight week span . Great job ! \u201d\nYes , great job ! Totally awesome . We \u2019 re only six times behind where we should be on the South Korean scale of what Trump considers to be \u201c testing \u201d .\nIt \u2019 s not entirely clear that anyone has \u201c tested \u201d Trump with a multiple-choice quiz about this pandemic and how to end it . Lobbed an obvious question about the tests on Wednesday , he spun his tale of failure into a Technicolor tapestry of dopey lies and lazy delusions .\n\u201c We have tested , by far , more than anybody . We \u2019 re testing more than anybody right now . There \u2019 s nobody even close . And our tests are the best tests . They \u2019 re the most accurate tests , \u201d he riffed , as if his words had uncoupled themselves from the gravitational pull of meaning and begun floating into the upper reaches of his empty skull .\n\u201c But if you \u2019 re saying we \u2019 re going to test 350 million people , \u201d he continued , \u201c I disagree with it . We can go to certain states \u2013 I could name them now , but I \u2019 m not going to do that \u2013 but we can go to certain states right now . They have virtually no problem or a very small problem . \u201d\nThere is only one place where that claim is true , and that would be the state of denial : Donald Trump \u2019 s home state when the going gets tough .\nFor those looking at far less important numbers , like Trump \u2019 s rising approval ratings or the yo-yo stock market , these are confusing times . How can anything be rising when we have such catastrophically incompetent leadership ?\nThis is the crackerjack team that is dithering over a $ 1bn deal to produce 80,000 critically needed ventilators while waving through a $ 2tn stimulus bill that includes $ 50bn for airlines . Flying may be important to the economy , but breathing is surely worth one-fiftieth of the support .\nTrump would dearly love to tell a story about Democratic states suffering while Republican ones are virus-free . But Florida complicates that picture , and the pesky numbers show the virus has reached every state in the union . Even with the fractional testing that we \u2019 re doing .\nLike every con artist , Trump knows when the mark has moved on . You can fool some of the people all of the time , especially if they watch Fox News . You can even fool a plurality of the people at election time , with a billion dollars of Facebook disinformation . But you can \u2019 t fool all of the people , especially at a time of pandemic and recession .\nSo his numbers are sliding downwards just as surely as the virus numbers are climbing upwards .
