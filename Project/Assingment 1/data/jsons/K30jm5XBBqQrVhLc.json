Like a pool player announcing a six-ball break and then sinking six , Hillary Clinton all but announced she would bait Trump into losing his head during the first presidential debate and then did so , sending him into a spiral of self-destruction . You don \u2019 t have to like Clinton to tip your hat to the achievement or concede that it was a public service . That Trump was arrogant and insouciant enough to walk into the most important 90 minutes of his campaign unprepared\u2014and then spend the following week rehashing it in midnight rants\u2014showed every fence-sitting voter how dangerous he would be in power . A competent performance in debates two and three won \u2019 t undo the damage , nor should it . ( An amateurish debate rehearsal Thursday night , which Trump conducted in front of a live audience of supporters and with a pro-Trump moderator , quickly fell apart when he couldn \u2019 t keep his rambling answers within the allotted two minutes .

That he poisoned his ideas with his character\u2014trafficking in racial provocations , cynicism , cruelty , prevarication , bullying , narcissism , ignorance , and impulsivity\u2014was his great crime . And that was before a video emerged on Friday of Trump bragging about how he enjoys groping women\u2014a revelation that resulted in a lukewarm apology , numerous high-ranking Republicans withdrawing their support , and his own V.P . nominee rebuking him .
