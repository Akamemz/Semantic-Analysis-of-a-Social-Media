    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Wilbur Ross had just started running the Department of Commerce , but he was growing impatient over the 2020 census , still three years away .\n`` I am mystified why nothing ( has ) been done in response to my months-old request that we include the citizenship question , '' Ross emailed to a staff member just two months into his new job on May 2 , 2017 . `` Why not ? ''\nThe commerce secretary had gotten an earful about the issue from Kris Kobach , the Kansas secretary of state who was about to be named vice chairman of President Donald Trump 's `` Advisory Commission on Election Integrity . '' Kobach had been recommended to Ross by Steve Bannon , the president 's chief strategist and White House senior counselor , who was a fierce opponent of the nation 's immigration policies .\nThe citizenship question : Feds and other groups fought for months before courts nixed it\nCourt challenges : Trump administration plan for census citizenship question ruled against by third federal judge\nBut it would take another seven months and the direct intervention of Attorney General Jeff Sessions to grant Ross ' wish . Two weeks before Christmas , the Justice Department finally asked for what Ross already knew he wanted \u2013 and Census Bureau officials learned for the first time that the citizenship question was even under consideration .\nThis is the story of that convoluted decision-making process , as recounted by three federal district court judges who presided over separate trials in New York , California and Maryland . Now it 's headed to the Supreme Court .\nThe high court , which has called the census `` the linchpin of the federal statistical system , '' will hear the case April 23 and issue its verdict by the end of June . It must decide if Ross had ample reason to ask about citizenship , followed acceptable procedures and acted within the bounds of the Constitution .\nThat 's not the portrayal that emerges from the three lower court rulings . Rather , it is one of a Republican administration determined to use the decennial census to locate noncitizens \u2013 and to benefit politically whether it finds them or not .\nSo far , Ross has an 0-3 record in the district courts , where judges named by President Barack Obama have described acts of subterfuge and misleading statements intended to obscure the real reasons for asking the citizenship question .\n`` Those acts and statements are not the transparent acts and statements one would expect from government officials who have decided , for bona fide and defensible reasons , to change policy , '' Judge Jesse Furman ruled in New York in January . `` Nor are they the acts and statements of government officials who are merely trying to cut through red tape .\n`` Instead , '' Furman said , `` they are the acts and statements of officials with something to hide . ''\nBy the time Ross was confirmed as secretary of commerce on Feb. 27 , 2017 , the Census Bureau was on the verge of telling Congress what the census would ask about : The usual questions about gender , age , race , ethnicity , and homeownership .\nThe 79-year-old commerce secretary had what he considered to be a fundamental question : Were noncitizens routinely counted ?\nThe answer was unambiguous : Anyone `` with a usual residence in the 50 states '' was counted so that seats in the House of Representatives could be apportioned among states . The goal of the decennial census \u2013 conducted every 10 years since 1790 when Thomas Jefferson supervised it \u2013 is counting heads .\nDuring the spring of 2017 , Ross discussed the possibility of adding what Kobach called `` one simple question '' to the census with Sessions , Bannon , Kobach and others .\nBannon , the former Breitbart News executive , had helped Trump win election with a promise to build a border wall and deport undocumented immigrants . Kobach 's concern was mirrored in his work on the ill-fated election integrity commission , which would look into alleged voter fraud among noncitizens and others before disbanding in disarray at the start of 2018 .\nThe Kansas official said geographic data on noncitizens was needed to address the `` problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside ' in the United States are still counted for congressional apportionment purposes . ''\nBy early May , Ross was clearly on board , and he fumed about bureaucratic delays . `` Worst of all , '' he wrote to his deputy chief of staff , Earl Comstock , census officials `` emphasize that they have settled with Congress on the questions to be asked . ''\nDespite the wishes of the two Trump allies , Comstock told Ross they needed a formal request from the Justice Department . They knew what they wanted , but they needed a reason that would `` clear ( the ) legal thresholds . ''\nOn May 4 \u2013 two days after Ross ' `` mystified '' email \u2013 White House officials pointed Commerce officials toward the Justice Department for what would turn out to be a seven-month effort to justify the citizenship question .\nAt the Justice Department , the director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review said the department did n't want to get involved . The New York trial record attributes that to `` the difficulties Justice was encountering in the press at the time ( the whole Comey matter ) , '' an apparent reference to the firing in May of FBI Director James Comey .\nThings did n't go any better at the Department of Homeland Security . Despite a series of phone calls , officials there said the issue should be handled by the Justice Department . This prompted Commerce officials to consider `` how Commerce could add the question to the Census itself . ''\nBy mid-July , Kobach was back , emailing Ross to remind him of their earlier phone call , and later speaking to Ross again by phone . On August 8 , Ross emailed Comstock that if Justice had not decided whether to get involved , `` please let me know your contact person , and I will call the AG . ''\nComstock urged caution . `` Since this issue will go to the Supreme Court , we need to be diligent in preparing the administrative record , '' he responded .\nRoss went even further : `` We should be very careful about everything , whether or not it is likely to end up in the SC . ''\nThe ice finally was broken in mid-September , when John Gore , the Justice Department 's acting assistant attorney general , entered the fray . Soon after , Danielle Cutrona in Sessions ' office wrote to Wendy Teramoto , Ross ' chief of staff at the Commerce Department .\n`` It sounds like we can do whatever you all need us to do , and the delay was due to a miscommunication , '' Cutrona said . `` The AG is eager to assist . ''\nRoss and Sessions then spoke at least twice by phone , and political appointees at the Justice Department began work on a letter requesting the citizenship question .\nOn Nov. 27 \u2013 a day after court records indicate Ross spoke with President Trump , and a day before the commerce secretary would turn 80 \u2013 he emailed a staffer working on the issue . The Census Bureau was getting ready to start translating census questions into multiple languages and had set the printing contract .\n`` We are out of time , '' Ross wrote . `` Please set up a call for me tomorrow with whoever is the responsible person at Justice . We must get this resolved . ''\nIt was two weeks later when Arthur Gary , a Justice Department career official , sent the formal request to the Census Bureau 's acting director , Ron Jarmin . The reason for the question , Gary said , was to enforce the Voting Rights Act .\nWithin days of the Dec. 12 letter , the bureau 's `` SWAT Team '' of senior professional staff began churning out briefing documents and reports showing that the citizenship question would reduce response rates among households with noncitizens . That would force the bureau to conduct more followup work , at an estimated additional cost of $ 27.5 million .\nThe court records are replete with memos from census officials \u2013 on Dec. 22 , Jan. 3 , and ultimately Jan. 19 , when they advised Ross that asking about citizenship `` is very costly , harms the quality of the census count , and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data '' than other government sources .\nCensus officials sought to meet with their Justice Department counterparts but were rebuffed at Sessions ' direction , court records show . A single meeting with Ross did n't change anything .\nOn Feb. 12 , Kobach wrote Ross to endorse the new rationale \u2013 enforcing the Voting Rights Act , which is intended to give members of minority groups the opportunity to elect representatives of their choosing . He also mentioned his concerns about voter fraud and said the citizenship question would help for `` election-related reasons . ''\nBy now , Ross had what he wanted . But he also wanted a cheering section .\nCommerce and census officials went searching for interest groups to support their cause but emerged nearly empty-handed . In the end , only the conservative Heritage Foundation and Center for Immigration Studies , which seeks to slash immigration rates , agreed to speak favorably about the plan .\nThree days before directing the Census Bureau to add the question , Ross spoke with Christine Pierce , senior vice president for data science at Nielsen Co. She warned `` unequivocally '' that the question likely would reduce response rates .\nOn March 26 , Ross ' `` Decision Memo '' directed the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question , based on the Justice Department 's request . He said the `` need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate . ''\nAll three judges who heard challenges from states and immigrant rights groups concluded basically the same thing : Ross worked backwards . He decided to ask about citizenship in the 2020 census and then went searching for a legitimate reason .\n`` It was like 'Jeopardy , ' '' said Dale Ho , director of voting rights at the American Civil Liberties Union , one of the lawyers who will argue the case in the Supreme Court . `` They had the answer .
