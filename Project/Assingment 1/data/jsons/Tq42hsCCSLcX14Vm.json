    "content": "In a nearly 30-minute interview on CNN 's `` New Day , '' Ben Carson repeatedly lashed out at recent inquiries into his violent childhood as `` pathetic '' and attacked host Alisyn Camerota Friday morning for pushing what he called a `` smear campaign . ''\nOn Thursday , CNN revealed that it was unable to corroborate any of Carson 's past accounts , including claims he once punched a classmate and stabbed another . According to CNN , at least nine of Carson 's childhood classmates had no recollection of events as described by Carson .\nWhen Camerota asked Carson about CNN 's report , a frustrated Carson raised his voice from a whisper to a more forceful inside voice .\n`` This is a bunch of lies attempting to say I 'm lying about my history , I think it 's pathetic , and basically what the media does is they try to get you distracted , '' Carson pushed back .\n`` It is just garbage , '' Carson told Camerota . `` We have too many things that are important to deal with . ''\nUndeterred , Camerota asked Carson about specific discrepancies , namely why the CNN reporters who traveled to Detroit were unable to identify any of his past victims .\n`` Dr. Carson , your story has changed , '' Camerota pointed out , asking Carson why he changed the name and relation of the young man he claimed to have stabbed as an adolescent .\n`` The names I used for instance are fictitious names because I do n't want to bring people into something like this because I know what you guys do to their lives\u200e , '' Carson told Camerota , insisting that the young man he stabbed does indeed exist .\n`` I talked to him . He would prefer to stay out of the media and I want to respect that , '' Carson explained . `` That 's not the real name , but yes he 's a very real person . I talked to him yesterday , '' Carson said . `` He was a family member , and you know , I really do n't want to expose him further . ''\n\u201c The story is well-documented , '' Carson continued . `` If you choose not to believe it , if it doesn \u2019 t fit the narrative that you want , that \u2019 s fine . Let \u2019 s let the American people decide . \u201d\nBut when Camerota insisted that CNN had simply participated in a longstanding journalistic practice of vetting presidential candidates , Carson rehashed the tried and true complaint against a biased media .\n`` Give me a break . Are you kidding ?

Promise you 're going to do that ? We 're waiting . ''\nPushing him on his complaints of a mainstream media bias , Camerota asked Carson about a new Mother Jones report highlighting a 2014 speech during which the retired neurosurgeon said that \u201c we \u2019 d be Cuba if there were no Fox News , \u201d and joking that some Americans are `` stupid .
