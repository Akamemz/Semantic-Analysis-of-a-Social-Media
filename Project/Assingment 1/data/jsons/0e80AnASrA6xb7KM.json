Clearly , Trump and the Republicans didn \u2019 t get that economic bump .\nDonald Trump appears at a rally in Mesa , Arizona ( Gage Skidmore | flickr ) An unusual but interesting economic analysis by Barry Ritholtz factored in economic conditions with the election results and concluded that no president in the last 100 years has fared worse in a midterm congressional election at a time of economic expansion and declining unemployment .\nElection 2018 may have been \u201c all about Trump , \u201d but it turned out to be the latest \u201c wave \u201d election \u2014 of which there have been , arguably , four in the recent past : 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , 2014 . American political institutions have been known for their decades of stability , so this recent past represents a noteworthy level of polarization and volatility .\nOPINION POLLS show that voters increasingly interpret their personal financial situation , their rating of the national economy and their sense of whether the U.S. is on the \u201c right track \u201d or \u201c wrong track \u201d through a partisan lens .\nSo in these midterms , two-thirds of voters said they thought the economy was \u201c excellent or good , \u201d but 75 percent of Democrats said it was \u201c not so good or poor . \u201d\nThe polarization of the U.S. electorate is usually explained as a decades-long process of political coalitions reforming around the Democratic and Republican Parties .\nFor Republicans , the backlash against the civil rights movement and Richard Nixon \u2019 s \u201c Southern strategy \u201d solidified the migration of conservative white Southerners from the Dixiecrat wing of the Democratic Party to the Republicans . The \u201c Reagan revolution \u201d of the early 1980s helped extinguish what used to be called the liberal/moderate \u201c Rockefeller Republican \u201d wing of the GOP .\nThis made the Republicans and their voting bloc much more uniformly conservative . And despite the hopes of socialists who looked for a \u201c realignment \u201d of the Democratic Party into a more consistently liberal formation , the flight of the Dixiecrats opened the door to \u201c new Democrats \u201d like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton , who shifted more decisively toward the pro-business right on economic policy .\nFor the last 40 years , mainstream politics in the U.S. has oscillated between a center-right Democratic Party and a firmly right Republican Party .\nBut just focusing on the politics at the top of the two main parties doesn \u2019 t actually provide insight into how voters ( and nonvoters ) polarize along standard left-right measures .\nOn this point , there is evidence linking the growth of economic inequality to political polarization , according to Stanford University researcher Christos Makridis :\n[ T ] he evidence indicates not only a strong correlation between income inequality and political polarization but also potential causality : Greater income inequality can amplify political tensions by raising polarization . These results imply that income inequality can indirectly affect economic outcomes by increasing the fraction of people who identify as extreme liberal .\nThat the political system doesn \u2019 t necessarily register this increase in \u201c extreme liberals \u201d may point to two other well-established findings : that poorer people with more liberal views tend to be nonvoters , and that the political system reflects the views of the wealthy much more than those of the non-wealthy .\nWITH OFFICIAL unemployment rates down to levels not seen since the late 1960s , and with median household income finally recovering after a \u201c lost decade \u201d since the Great Recession , you might think that the midterm elections would reward the incumbent party .\nBut that certainly wasn \u2019 t the case in 2018 . In fact , the midterm electorate \u201c threw the bums out \u201d \u2014 at least in the House , and in a good number of state races for executive and legislative office \u2014 and for the fourth time in the last 12 years .
