Bloomberg says that \u201c 95 percent \u201d of murders and murder victims are young male minorities and that \u201c you can just take the description , Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. \u201d To combat crime , he says , \u201c put a lot of cops where the crime is , which means in minority neighborhoods . \u201d\nIn the audio , he acknowledges focusing police forces in minority neighborhoods means minorities are disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession , but dismisses that as a necessary consequence of the crime in those neighborhoods . And to \u201c get the guns out of the kids hands , \u201d Bloomberg says , police must \u201c throw \u2019 em against the wall and frisk \u2019 em . \u201d\n\u201c And they say , \u2018 oh , I don \u2019 t want that , I don \u2019 t wan na get caught. \u2019 So they don \u2019 t bring the gun , \u201d he says .\nAccording to a report in the Aspen Times that year , Bloomberg blocked the release of video of the Aspen Institute appearance , but the Aspen Times reporter uploaded what appears to be the full audio online , and it drew renewed attention Monday after podcaster Benjamin Dixon circulated it on twitter .\nIn his Tuesday statement , Bloomberg notes that he \u201c inherited the practice of stop and frisk \u201d from the previous administration , and noted that by the time he left office he significantly reduced its use . He said , \u201c I should have done it faster and sooner . \u201d\nBut stop and frisk expanded dramatically on Bloomberg \u2019 s watch , reaching a peak in 2011 when over 685,000 people were stopped , according to ACLU data .
