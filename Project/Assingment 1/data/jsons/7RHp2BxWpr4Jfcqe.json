The group is part of the ACLU \u2019 s \u201c Know Your Rights \u201d campaign , which encourages immigrants \u2013 both legal and illegal \u2013 to report abuse when their rights are violated while crossing the border .\n\u201c We are working towards policies that will change that , and will address that type of treatment to innocent people. \u201d said Cynthia Pompa , representing an ACLU office New Mexico , as reported by local El Paso news station KTSM . \u201c Everyone should feel like they can be respected , that they \u2019 re not criminals .
