Republican lawmakers were inquiring about the alleged targeting of Tea Party groups by the IRS more than a year ago .\nObama , who spoke during a press conference alongside the Turkish prime minister , focused his remarks specifically on the IG report , noting that he would n't have caught wind of that report since those investigations are typically kept under wraps . He reiterated that he found the agency 's actions `` unacceptable '' and sought to fix the problem `` the minute '' he found out about it . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has previously said no one in the White House knew about the practice .\nThe comments were the latest effort by the White House to tamp down the controversy .\nAfter his press conference , Obama announced the appointment of White House budget official Daniel Werfel as the next acting IRS commissioner . This comes after Obama announced Wednesday that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller would resign -- though Miller was apparently set to step down anyway .\nAn official close to Miller told Fox News , shortly after Obama 's brief announcement , that the IRS chief was `` set to resign the position of acting commission as of early June . '' He was planning to leave the IRS entirely a `` couple of months later , regardless of the current controversy , '' the source said .\nThese details were not mentioned by the president as he announced Wednesday evening Miller was resigning . Obama spoke following a meeting with Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and other top department officials in which they reviewed a highly critical inspector general \u2019 s report on the practice . The report concluded poor management allowed agents to improperly target Tea Party and other groups for more than 18 months , starting in 2010 .\nObama said Lew asked for the resignation and Miller agreed , after being on the job since November 2012 .\n\u201c Americans have a right to be angry about it , and I \u2019 m angry about it , \u201d Obama said from the White House .\nRepublicans , who along with Democrats have slammed the IRS for the practice , welcomed the resignation Wednesday but made clear they would continue to investigate and press for accountability .\nRep. Vern Buchanan , R-Fla. , said the resignation `` is a necessary first step but more heads need to roll . ''\nRep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minn. , reacting to the claim that Miller was leaving anyway , said it seemed like he was a `` perfect scapegoat '' for the administration .\nMiller \u2019 s resignation was part of three-step plan Obama outlined to fix the problem .\nThe other steps are to put in place the safeguards recommended in the IG report and to work with Congress as it investigates .\n\u201c The good news is we can fix this , \u201d Obama said .\nMiller became acting commissioner after Commissioner Douglas Shulman completed his five-year term . Shulman had been appointed by President George W. Bush .\nThe president has proceeded cautiously since the IRS controversy was made public Friday . While he initially said the accusations were `` outrageous , '' he also said he wanted to wait until the report was released before addressing what should be done to hold accountable those responsible .\nThe report lays much of the blame on IRS supervisors in Washington who oversaw a group of specialists in Cincinnati who screened applications for tax-exempt status . It does not indicate that Washington initiated the targeting of conservative groups , but it does say a top supervisor in Washington did not adequately supervise agents in the field even after she learned the agents were acting improperly .\nThe Justice Department is also investigating the IRS targeting , as are three congressional committees .\nSources told Fox News that Miller will remain on the job `` for a couple of weeks .
