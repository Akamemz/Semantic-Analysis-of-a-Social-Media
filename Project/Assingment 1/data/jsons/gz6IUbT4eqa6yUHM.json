    "content": "Edward Kleinbard analyzed the Republican tax \u201c framework \u201d earlier this month . The bill introduced this week contains the elements he discusses , with one caveat : It attempts to constrain taxpayers from converting compensation income into \u201c pass-through \u201d income , which would be taxed at a preferential 25 percent rate . ( For instance , an active manager of a pass-through business would be entitled to treat only 30 percent of his share of income from that source as qualifying for the preferential tax rate . ) But it \u2019 s too soon to know whether those limitations will be effective , or if they will even end up in the final legislation :\nTo understand the business tax provisions in the Trump tax proposals , begin with F. Scott Fitzgerald \u2019 s insight that the rich are different from you and me \u2014 they have more money .\nIn particular , they have more capital . ( Ever polite , economists call piles of money that have been invested \u201c capital. \u201d ) Business tax reform really is an exercise in how we should tax capital income \u2014 that is , returns on investments . And because the rich have lots more capital than do you or I , the benefits of the multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts proposed by the Trump administration \u2019 s tax \u201c framework \u201d necessarily will be vacuumed up by the most affluent Americans . Business tax reform has only a modest connection to the economic future of working stiffs , and the small connection that does exist is a second-order effect .\nThe Trump framework offers two critical tax cuts for businesses and their owners : First , it reduces the tax rate on corporate income from 35 to 20 percent ; and second , it caps the taxes imposed on owners of \u201c pass-through \u201d businesses like partnerships and S corporations , by creating a new 25 percent tax bracket for those owners \u2019 pass-through income .\n( As Republicans never tire of pointing out , regular corporations and their shareholders in theory are subject to double taxation \u2014 once when the income is earned by the corporation and again when it \u2019 s distributed as taxable dividends to individual shareholders . This rule , however , is honored almost exclusively in the breach . By contrast , the owners of \u201c pass-through \u201d entities are taxed directly on the income of their pass-throughs . Most privately owned companies are organized as pass-throughs ; virtually all publicly traded companies are taxed as corporations . )\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the changes to corporate and pass-through tax rates , plus some ancillary rules , will slash tax collections by more than $ 2.6 trillion in forgone revenue over the next 10 years . By contrast , the purely individual provisions in the Trump plan are estimated to raise about $ 500 billion in taxes from all of us over the same period . So , viewing things in the aggregate , the overall tax cuts promised by the framework are entirely a story about the business tax side of things : The individual side is a net tax hike . More particularly , the overall impact of the tax framework is a story about who benefits from business tax cuts .\nMitt Romney was right when he said that corporations don \u2019 t pay taxes \u2014 people do . You \u2019 ve never seen a corporation walking down the sidewalk , because it \u2019 s a legal fiction . In the end , one group of people or another shoulders the burden of the corporate tax , or in this case enjoys the benefits of slashing the rate to 20 percent . But which people ?\nPresident Trump and other apologists for the Republican plan insist that they \u2019 re not in it for the money for themselves , but are simply the selfless servants of the average worker . They argue that a lower corporate rate translates directly into higher wages . Now , it is true that one can construct simple models that imply such a result , but the reason they do is that within these models , a high corporate tax chases capital investment away from the United States to lower-taxed countries , so that capital can enjoy higher after-tax returns , leaving less capital behind invested in the productivity of each American worker .\nThese models do not apply to the modern American multinational corporation , as several studies have found . For that reason , the US Treasury in recent years has assumed that 82 percent of the burden of the corporate tax ( or the benefit of a corporate tax rate cut ) falls on the shoulders of owners of capital , not working Joes , and the leading nonpartisan economic institutions and analysts Congress relies on ( namely the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation ) employ similar rules of thumb .\nIn fact , the Treasury economists \u2019 careful work here is so damning to the framework \u2019 s enterprise that the political bosses at Treasury have ordered the study removed from its website .\nEven within the small fraction thought to fall on labor , these agencies conclude that labor bears its share of the corporate tax in proportion to incomes . So top executives , with their outsize compensation , would get the lion \u2019 s share of any portion of a corporate tax cut attributable to labor .\nAs it happens , there is good reason to reduce the corporate tax rate . But that \u2019 s principally because the full 35 percent rate applies so unevenly and to relatively few corporations . One sophisticated study concluded that the average tax rate actually paid by US corporations ( their \u201c effective \u201d tax rate ) was about 23 percent \u2014 or 32 percent if one pretended that all corporate income was immediately distributed as dividends . And when it comes to US multinationals , the results are even more skewed , due to what I \u2019 ve dubbed their \u201c stateless income \u201d shenanigans . Microsoft , for example , announced to shareholders that in 2016 , its US operations lost $ 325 million .\nFortunately , it booked $ 20 billion in profits outside the United States ! A close examination of its tax footnote in its financials reveals that its foreign earnings bear an effective foreign tax rate of around 5 percent . As even the tax framework acknowledges , tax reform here will be all about imposing a minimum tax as a floor on companies \u2019 stateless income planning .\nWe find ourselves back at the central question . To understand who benefits from business tax rate cuts , we need to ask : Who owns capital in America ? Unlike many other tax imponderables , we actually know a lot about this .\nCapital income is much more concentrated , in fact , than is overall income : The top 1 percent captures about 21 percent of overall income in the United States ( itself quite extraordinary ) but double that proportion of capital income . What \u2019 s more , capital ownership in the United States is extraordinarily concentrated at the very top of the top end : Those with wealth exceeding $ 20 million ( the top one-thousandth , or 0.1 percent ) own as much as do the bottom 90 percent .\nDespite GOP claims , the new rate on \u201c pass-through \u201d entities won \u2019 t do much for small businesses\nThe overall lesson is plain : The average line worker is not the principal beneficiary of corporate rate reduction . Nor , we can safely say , is Ma and Pa Kettle \u2019 s Muffler Shop the prototypical pass-through business that will benefit from the 25 percent rate cap on pass-through income .\nTaxpayers who receive income from pass-throughs pay at the individual rate . The framework \u2019 s proposal for special tax treatment for pass-throughs is being pitched as something that will help small businesses , but it confuses small businesses with pass-through businesses . The real advantages will flow to large pass-throughs and the most affluent investors . The top 1 percent of Americans earn 69 percent of all pass-through income ; they are the ones who will garner the benefits of the preferential pass-through rate .\nGenuinely small businesses aren \u2019 t the object here , given that without the special deal incomes , up to $ 233,000 ( married filing jointly ) would be taxed at 25 percent simply by virtue of the new tax brackets . And , as it happens , the average tax rate imposed on pass-throughs today is around 19 percent , making the case for providing a 25 percent ceiling on pass-through tax rates even tougher to see .\nLower pass-through rates will also redirect energy away from business productivity into creative tax accounting . Lawyers go to work to shoehorn back into the 25 percent preferential rate whatever income Congress purports to exclude from it .\nMeanwhile , owner-entrepreneurs will be induced to engage in what I call \u201c labor stuffing. \u201d Instead of paying herself a salary , the owner-entrepreneur will extract her share of her firm \u2019 s earnings in the form of business income , thereby masquerading labor income as qualifying capital income . I \u2019 ve spent an enormous amount of time working on this problem in a related context , and have proposed a technical solution ( short version here ) . The \u201c Big Six \u201d lawmakers who drafted the framework have done no work to address this .\nBut what about growth ? Surely the Tax Policy Center \u2019 s $ 2.6 trillion deficit-ballooning estimate for the cost of the plan \u2019 s business tax gifts will lead to faster growth that will make all of us better off , and offset the apparent cost of the framework to boot ? Would that it were so , but responsible economists agree that this is just not true , whether one looks to history ( most recently , Kansas ) or theory . The idea that the growth fairy can be propitiated only through tax cuts is faith-based economics .\nThe tax framework will produce a multitrillion-dollar increase in our deficits by forgoing tax revenues in order to cut taxes on the very must affluent . This spurt in deficits will impede , not accelerate , growth , by increasing the interest rates paid by US businesses . It also will make our ability to respond to the next recession that much more precarious .\nLook at it this way : When interest rates are still near their lowest levels in decades , and banks are lending , where is the evidence that firms right now are facing difficulty in finding the capital to invest in attractive opportunities ? There is none . In fact , the framework \u2019 s combination of expensing business investments and permitting at least some interest deductions would reduce the effective ( real-life ) tax rates on those investments below zero , which means that we all would be subsidizing firms in replacing American workers by machines .\nFinally , it might be suggested that only envy can explain my preoccupation \u2014 and that of other commentators \u2014 with how generous the framework \u2019 s business tax cuts are to the most affluent Americans . So long as low- and middle-income taxpayers are also better off , who cares about the largesse at the top ? The answers are , first , millions of ordinary Americans in fact will be worse off \u2014 as the Tax Policy Center \u2019 s preliminary analysis makes clear .\nAnd second , we all have a vital interest in the financial stability of the United States . The tax framework will produce a multitrillion-dollar increase in our deficits by forgoing tax revenues in order to cut taxes on the very must affluent . This spurt in deficits will impede , not accelerate , growth , by increasing the interest rates paid by US businesses . It also will make our ability to respond to the next recession that much more precarious . So , yes , in this case , all of us have a vital interest in not giving away the store to some of us .\nTo paraphrase Fitzgerald , the ownership of business capital and business capital income is what distinguishes the rich from you and me , and for this reason , the lion \u2019 s share of the Trump framework \u2019 s multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts can not help but be captured by the most affluent Americans .
