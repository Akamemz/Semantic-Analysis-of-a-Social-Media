The science should not stand in the way of this . And as Dr. Scott Atlas said , I thought this was a good quote . Of course , we can do it . Everyone else in the Western world , our peer nations are doing it . We are the outlier here . The science is very clear on this , that for instance , you look at the JAMA Pediatric study of 46 pediatric hospitals in North America that said the risk of critical illness from COVID is far less for children than that of seasonal flu .
