Consequently , the amount of federal debt held by the public has surged , \u201d the nonpartisan agency \u2019 s analysts said in a grim review of the government \u2019 s budget challenges .\nThe CBO said growing debt will be driven chiefly by an aging population that needs higher spending on health care , and by higher interest payments on the debt . Public debt will be equal to 70 percent of gross domestic product at the end of this fiscal year \u2014 up from 40 percent at the end of 2008 [ - ] and will be on its way to more than 200 percent of GDP by 2037 .\nAt that level , fiscal catastrophes are more likely , and the government \u2019 s ability to respond becomes far more constrained .\nIronically , the CBO said the deep deficits and debt don \u2019 t have to happen .
