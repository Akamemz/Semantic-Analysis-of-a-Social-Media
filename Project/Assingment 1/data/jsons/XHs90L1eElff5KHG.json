The document reportedly said an official handed over 200 numbers , some of which covered 35 world leaders . Those leaders were not named .\nHowever , the German government already has lashed out at the U.S. over reports that Merkel may have been targeted . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney , while saying the U.S. `` is not monitoring and will not monitor '' Merkel 's communications , conspicuously did not deny that such surveillance may have occurred in the past .\nOn Thursday , the German Foreign Ministry summoned U.S . Ambassador John B. Emerson for a meeting with Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle .\nIn a written statement , Westerwelle said he told the ambassador `` it is unacceptable that the mobile phone of our Federal Chancellor may have been subject to surveillance activities by our American partners . ''\n`` For us , spying on close friends and partners is totally unacceptable . This undermines trust , and this can harm our friendship , '' the foreign minister said . `` We need the truth now . ''\nFor Washington , it is the latest in a series of flare-ups over reported surveillance that lately have involved France , Mexico and Brazil .\nMore damaging information could be on the horizon . The Washington Post reported Friday that U.S. officials are telling some foreign intelligence agencies that NSA leaker Edward Snowden has documents detailing their cooperation with the United States .\nThis week , France demanded explanations of a report the U.S. swept up millions of French phone records , and also summoned the American ambassador to demand an explanation .\nGermany , which has Europe 's biggest economy , has been one of Washington 's closest allies in Europe .
