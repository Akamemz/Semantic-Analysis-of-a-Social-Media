    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. government is paying more than $ 130,000 a month to lease space in Trump Tower for the military office that supports the White House , even though Donald Trump hasn \u2019 t spent a night at the New York skyscraper since becoming president .\nThe government signed a $ 2.39 million lease to rent a 3,475 sq . ft. space in the building for the military from April 11 , 2017 , to Sept. 30 , 2018 , nearly 18 months in total , according to lease documents that The Wall Street Journal obtained through a freedom of information request .\nThe government agreed to pay $ 180,000 for the last 20 days of April 2017 and $ 130,000 a month thereafter , according to the contract released by the General Services Administration , the agency that negotiates office space agreements for the government .\nThe GSA redacted large portions of the lease , including the name of the person who owns the Trump Tower space the government is renting . A Pentagon official wrote in a letter seen by the Journal that the space is owned privately by someone unaffiliated with the Trump Organization and that the department sees no way in which Mr. Trump can benefit from the rent money . Records indicate the owner is Joel R. Anderson , Mr. Trump \u2019 s neighbor .\nThe military \u2019 s lease in Trump Tower puts the space far above market rate for similarly sized apartments in the luxury high rise market and makes it one of the most expensive residential rentals in Manhattan .\nThe U.S. military uses the White House Military Office to provide medical , food , transportation and communications services that by regulation need to be close to the president at all times . The military also ensures that the so-called nuclear football\u2014the briefcase that allows the president to authorize a nuclear attack\u2014accompanies the commander in chief during his travels . Its operations are separate from those of the Secret Service .\nThe rental figure , which hasn \u2019 t been disclosed previously , is only for the Defense Department . Other agencies , such as the U.S. Secret Service , also face increased costs stemming from Mr. Trump \u2019 s frequent visits to his other properties and his large family .\nThe Secret Service , for example , requested an additional $ 25.7 million in the 2018 budget to cover expenses associated with securing Trump Tower and the president \u2019 s \u201c protective footprint \u201d in New York City .\nThe most expensive Trump Tower listing recently was a 3,725 sq . ft. , three-bedroom apartment on the 62nd floor . It was listed in the spring of 2016 for $ 50,000 a month unfurnished and $ 60,000 a month furnished , according to Streeteasy.com .\nThe Pentagon said in February that it was looking to lease space in Trump Tower to carry out its support functions for Mr. Trump , who has both a home and an office in the New York skyscraper that bears his name .\nMr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News in April that he feels guilty when he returns to Trump Tower because it is very expensive for the country and the street closures inconvenience New Yorkers . First lady Melania Trump and Barron Trump , the couple \u2019 s son , moved to the White House from Trump Tower on June 11 .\nThe White House didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment . The Pentagon referred a request for comment on the matter to the White House and the GSA .\nJames A. MacStravic , the acting undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology and Logistics , said in a March 3 letter to Rep. Jackie Speier , a California Democrat , that the Pentagon wasn \u2019 t aware of any means by which Mr. Trump would benefit personally from the lease .\n\u201c To alleviate your principal concern ( i.e . that the president of the United States might financially benefit from the lease effort ) , please know that this residential space is privately owned and that lease negotiations have been with the owner \u2019 s representatives only , \u201d Mr. MacStravic wrote before the lease was signed . \u201c We are not aware of any means through which the president would personally benefit from a government lease of this space . \u201d\nMr. MacStravic said in the letter that the White House Military Office had requested approval to lease space in Trump Tower for personnel assigned to support the president while at his private residence , which he said in the letter was typical of similar support provided to past presidents and vice presidents .\nThe requirement for proximity to the president \u2019 s residence \u201c drives the location and price for this acquisition , \u201d he said , noting that his office \u2019 s analysis indicated that renting in the building was cheaper than purchasing .\nThe GSA signed an 18-month \u201c firm lease \u201d with the owner of the Trump Tower property , according to the document .
