He said his recent negotiations with Mexico are bearing fruit with a drop in the number of illegal immigrants reaching the U.S. border .\n\u201c It \u2019 s cut way down , \u201d the president told reporters in the Oval Office during a ceremony to sign the border spending bill . \u201c Right now they \u2019 re doing a very good job . We \u2019 re very happy with the job they \u2019 re doing . \u201d\nMr. Trump , fresh off his historic trip to the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea , also said he is thinking about trying to delay the 2020 census to shoehorn in a question about citizenship . He said it \u2019 s important to know who is a citizen and who is \u201c an illegal . \u201d\nThe president also defended Border Patrol agents after Pro Publica , a news website , revealed a secret Facebook group of current and former agents where posts included lewd photos and disparaging messages aimed at migrants .\n\u201c The Border Patrol , they \u2019 re patriots , they \u2019 re great people , \u201d Mr. Trump said \u2014 though he said he hadn \u2019 t seen the offensive posts in question .\nOne target of the posts was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a New York Democrat who joined colleagues for the tour of border detention facilities Monday and who emerged to say she was stunned by the conditions .\n\u201c What we saw today was unconscionable , \u201d she said . \u201c No child should ever be separated from their parent . No child should ever be taken from their family . No woman should ever be locked up in a pen when they have done no harm to another human being . \u201d\nRep. Joaquin Castro , Texas Democrat and chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , said one cell they saw didn \u2019 t have running water . That was where they heard one woman say she had been told to drink from the toilet .\nRep. Judy Chu , California Democrat , said she encountered an epileptic woman who was unable to get medication for her condition .\nThose conditions are still a far cry from the \u201c torture facilities \u201d conditions that Dr. Dolly Lucio Sevier reported to a federal court last month . She said two-thirds of infants she examined had respiratory infections and \u201c all children showed evidence of trauma . \u201d\nThe lawmakers suspected that what they saw , as bad as it was , was a cleaned-up version of the conditions that the families are facing in border facilities meant to house perhaps a fifth of the numbers and for far less time than they are staying .\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to claim that one woman slipped her a packet of shampoo given to migrants and said it was all they had to wash their entire body .\n\u201c Some women \u2019 s hair was falling out . Others had gone 15 days without taking a shower , \u201d she said .\nThe picture she painted was markedly different from what Brian Hastings , chief of operations at the Border Patrol , told Congress last week , when he said the storeroom at border facilities \u201c frankly looks like Costco , \u201d with shelves of what the agency calls \u201c consumables \u201d \u2014 blankets , soap and other basic necessities .\n\u201c We are providing those things now . We have been and we will continue to , \u201d Chief Hastings told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .\nBridging the gap between the dueling descriptions is tough , but both sides of the debate agree that the surge of people has overwhelmed the Homeland Security Department \u2019 s ability to deal with the situation .\nAcross the southwestern border , facilities designed for perhaps 4,000 people have held nearly 20,000 at times this spring . One official estimated that more than 400,000 illegal immigrants who arrived as family units have been released directly into communities this fiscal year .\n\u201c These facilities are not built to care for children . The people who are trained here , they are not trained to give care to children , \u201d said Rep.
