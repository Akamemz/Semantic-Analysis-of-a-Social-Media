The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) -- Liberal American Catholics greet almost anything uttered by Pope Francis with glee, but his latest pronouncement has them scratching their heads. Headlines proclaiming \"Pope says evolution, Big Bang are real\" could have been written in 1950.\n\nThat's when Pope Pius XII announced that Catholic doctrine and evolution could be compatible, an attitude endorsed--and even expanded upon--by Pope John Paul II, who said evolution is \"more than a hypothesis\" and \"effectively proven fact.\" Pope Francis is just following in those footsteps.\n\n\"God is not a divine being or a magician, but the creator who brought everything to life,\" the Pope said Monday in an address to a gathering on \"Evolving Concepts of Nature,\" hosted by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. \"Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of things that evolve.\"\n\nSo why all the headlines? Three reasons, I believe.\n\nFirst, some saw Pope Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, as backtracking on openness to evolution, preferring instead the concept of \"intelligent design,\" which accepts some aspects of evolution but not others (such as its being undirected).\n\nFrancis' words, then, indicate that the church is back on track with its openness toward evolutionary theory.\n\nSecondly, Francis is newsworthy, plain and simple.
