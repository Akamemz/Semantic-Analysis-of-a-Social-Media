Silence ruled in the city center, only punctuated by the sound of passing police helicopters.\n\nThursday's big demonstration against the summit, titled \"Welcome To Hell,\" was the first serious test for the police. Flyers from the organizers instructed people to \"be noisy, angry and combative.\" The police knew that this would be the first gathering of the \"black block\" \u2014 the extreme anarchist end of the anti-capitalist movement.\n\nPolice officers have saturated the district around the Messehallen convention center for days now.
