    "content": "Clarence Thomas , arguably the most conservative justice on the U.S. Supreme Court , may be known for his silence on the bench during oral arguments , but now he \u2019 s speaking out .\nIn an upcoming documentary , \u201c Created Equal : Clarence Thomas In His Own Words , \u201d Thomas describes his faith , his political awakening , his judicial philosophy , and the role race has played in his life , offering viewers rare insight into the mind of a justice known for his reticence on the public stage .\n\u201c \u2018 This is the wrong black guy , he has to be destroyed , ' \u201d Thomas says at one point in the film , characterizing those who opposed his nomination to the Supreme Court nomination in 1991 . \u201c Just say it . And now at least we \u2019 re honest with each other. \u201d Remembering the moment that Anita Hill \u2019 s allegations that he had sexually harassed her were made public , Thomas says , that \u2019 s when \u201c all heck broke loose . \u201d\nThe new documentary , which TIME saw in an intimate advance screening , will be released in 2020 and set to air on PBS in May . It was made by Manifold Productions , which is led by Michael Pack , a conservative filmmaker who has worked with Steve Bannon . President Donald Trump nominated Pack to be the head of the Broadcasting Board of Governors .\nThe film is largely sympathetic to Thomas . On its website , Manifold Productions says the purpose of the movie is to \u201c tell the Clarence Thomas story truly and fully , without cover-ups or distortions. \u201d Thomas and his wife Virginia are the only people whose interviews appear in the film . ( Other voices , including Hill \u2019 s , are included in old footage . )\nPack interviewed Thomas for more than 30 hours over a six month period . Speaking after a screening on Oct. 22 , he said he worried that including other original interviews would cause him to \u201c lose Justice Thomas \u2019 s voice. \u201d \u201c I felt it would also let viewers make up their own mind , \u201d Pack says . \u201c My deal with the audience was to let Justice Thomas tell his story and be fair to his story . \u201d\nMuch of the film addresses the justice \u2019 s upbringing , which brought him from poverty in rural Georgia to the highest court in the land , and tracks his personal and political transitions along the way .\nGet The Brief .
