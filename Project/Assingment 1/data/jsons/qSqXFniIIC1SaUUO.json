Bernie Sanders ( I\u2013Vt . ) claimed a narrow victory in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary Tuesday night , cementing the 78-year-old democratic socialist 's status as the de facto frontrunner for the party 's nomination . It 's a big victory for Sanders\u2014and a pivotal moment in the Democratic Party 's hard left turn toward socialism .\nWith 86 percent of precincts reporting , NBC News and Decision Desk HQ both projected that Sanders would win the state .\nSouth Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg was close on his heels , and Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D\u2013Minn . ) was expected to finish a respectable third . Meanwhile , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D\u2013Mass . ) and former Vice President Joe Biden suffered complete collapses , though neither gave any indication that they would drop out . Indeed , for the time being , this is a relatively competitive five-way race .\nNew Hampshire uses proportional voting , meaning that its 24 delegates would be split fairly evenly among the top three finishers : 9 for Sanders , 9 for Buttigieg , and 6 for Klobuchar .\nStill , there 's no denying that Sanders is now the most likely eventual nominee . He has a large and steady base of support , and Warren is not currently a significant threat for the arch-progressive vote .\nThe moderate lane , on the other hand , is quite crowded . Biden is hoping to rebound in the upcoming South Carolina primary , where he polls well with the state 's significant number of black voters . But the former vice president will eventually have to contend with former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg , who has a nearly unlimited pile of money to spend on campaign advertising .\nIn his remarks , Buttigieg congratulated Sanders on his `` strong showing . ''\n`` I admired Sen. Sanders when I was a student , '' said Buttigieg . `` I respect him greatly to this day . ''\nThe Sanders surge , though , is understandably concerning to the more moderate members of the Democratic coalition .\n`` The significance of Sanders 's standing in the race goes far beyond the next round of primaries , '' wrote The Atlantic 's Russell Berman . `` In the modern history of American politics , no candidate so firmly planted on the left has been so well positioned to capture the nomination of the Democratic Party . ''\nNew York magazine 's Jonathan Chait lamented that Biden 's anemic performance had crippled the chances of any mainstream Democrat and handed the nomination to a comparatively weak nominee .\n`` If not for Biden , a mainstream liberal Democrat might well have begun to consolidate support of a party establishment that is not looking for a candidate who will embrace wildly unpopular policies and a wildly unpopular socialist label while emphasizing transformative economic change in the midst of the best economy in a generation , '' wrote Chait . `` Incredibly , the sheer disarray of [ Sanders ' ] opposition has made him the favorite . ''\nWhether Sanders ' support for fundamental changes to the economy and self-avowed socialism will actually render him a weak general election candidate remains to be seen . Socialism is broadly popular with younger voters . And in any case , there 's some evidence that Sanders himself is popular with precisely the kind of independent , working-class , swing-state voters who handed the election to Donald Trump in 2016 .\n`` This victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump , '' Sanders said in his speech tonight . It might also be the beginning of the end for moderate Democrats ' 2020 aspirations . At present , the party belongs to the democratic socialist from Vermont .",
