The owner has applied to tear it down , but a group wants to convert it into a community space promoting dialogue , justice , and equity while honoring victims like Rouse . Some residents want it destroyed and others question whether transforming a building \u2019 s purpose can lead to wider transformation . But organizers believe that painful history needs to be examined to change the national narrative .\nThe last purpose-built Ku Klux Klan building in the United States stands at 1012 North Main St. in Fort Worth , roughly a mile from where Fred Rouse was lynched in 1921 .\nTwo weeks before Christmas , in 1921 , Fred Rouse was lying in a hospital bed , recovering from being beaten and stabbed by striking meatpacking workers .\nRouse was one of the black workers and immigrants hired to break the strike . He was leaving his shift when he was surrounded and threatened by striking workers , according to Fort Worth Star Telegram reports . Afraid for his life , Rouse shot and wounded two men before the crowd chased him down and beat him so badly police initially thought he was dead .\nHe had been in the hospital for five nights when about 30 white men came and took him from his hospital bed . He was found dead the next morning , riddled with bullets and hanging by a rope from a hackberry tree .\nThe hackberry tree was on Samuels Avenue about a mile from the Tarrant County courthouse , and about the same distance from a large meeting hall recently built by the Ku Klux Klan .\nThe tree is now gone , one of many relics of the past that modern , bustling Fort Worth has left behind . But the klan hall \u2013 believed to be the last purpose-built klan building in the United States \u2013 still stands at 1012 North Main St . The future of the building has sparked a passionate debate in the city that , a century later , is still rife with racial tension .\nAdam McKinney , a dance professor at Texas Christian University , had been working on a piece about Fred Rouse this year when he learned that the owner of the building had applied for permission from the city to tear it down .\n\u201c Adam was actually dancing in front of the building \u201d when he found out , recalls Daniel Banks , who with Mr. McKinney co-founded DNAWORKS , an arts and service organization , in 2006 .\n\u201c So he \u2019 s dancing , \u201d Dr. Banks continues , \u201c and I \u2019 m sending tweets out tagging the mayor and tagging our councilwoman saying , \u2018 We have plans for this building . Would you like to hear them ? \u2019 \u201d\nTheir plan , still in its infancy , is to convert the former klan hall into a shared community space focused on promoting dialogue , justice , and equity in Fort Worth while highlighting the city \u2019 s history of racism and racial violence and honoring its victims . In July , a city commission voted to delay granting permission to demolish the building for 180 days .\n\u201c We are in an extraordinary time in history to get it right , and by \u2018 right \u2019 I think I mean something about healing , and shifting our national narrative around race , \u201d says Mr. McKinney . \u201c The transformation of this building , this joint project , could be something transformational for us as a country . \u201d\nHenry Gass/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 The abandoned Ellis Pecan Co. building , built as a meeting hall by the Ku Klux Klan in 1925 . The building could be demolished in about four months but some locals want it to be saved and converted into something positive .\nPublic opinion over the building \u2019 s future runs the gamut , with the range of emotions felt most keenly in the African American community that makes up almost a fifth of the city .\nBefore the city commission vote in July , Raymond Brown \u2013 a Fort Worth resident for 55 years \u2013 stood up to give public comment . Wearing the jersey of football player and social justice advocate Colin Kaepernick , he told the room he had \u201c mixed emotions . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m still on the fence , \u201d he said . \u201c To preserve it to me feels like the old Fort Worth way . \u201d\nBilly Daniels Jr. was the only commissioner to vote against granting the 180-day delay .\n\u201c Everything that stands doesn \u2019 t necessarily need to be preserved , \u201d he said . \u201c For us to leave this standing would be to perpetuate that racial problem that we have yet to really get a handle on . \u201d\nHe was referring to a report released in December saying that racism in Forth Worth is \u201c systemic , institutional , and structural . \u201d\nThe report came from a special task force formed after a 2016 incident in which Jacqueline Craig , an African American woman , was arrested along with her two teenage daughters after she called police to report a neighbor grabbing her 8-year-old son \u2019 s neck .\nFort Worth also has seen the deaths of several unarmed black men at the hands of police , including Jermaine Darden during a 2013 raid and Christopher Lowe shortly after being taken into custody in 2018 . The task force found evidence of systemic racial disparities : Despite constituting 19 % of the population , African Americans accounted for 41 % of arrests in 2016 and 2017 ; all 14 Fort Worth Independent School District schools classified as \u201c Improvement Required \u201d by the state were in minority neighborhoods ; and racial segregation in the city , as measured by the federal dissimilarity index , increased between 2010 and 2018 .\nOutside a Starbucks in Montgomery Plaza , a historic department store converted into a shopping center and condominiums , Michael Bell is skeptical . A community activist since the mid-1980s , he doubts that converting the former klan hall into something devoted to healing race relations will make much difference .\n\u201c The real problem is as deep as the sidewalk , \u201d he says . \u201c Those attitudes have been crystallized \u2013 concretized , if you will \u2013 here in Fort Worth . \u201d\nAs the pastor at Greater St. Stephen First Church since 1985 , Dr. Bell has been in similar positions before . In the early 1990s he was part of the Tarrant Clergy for Inter-Ethnic Peace and Justice , a community group that received a local award \u201c for improving and promoting positive human relations. \u201d The group closed up shop a few years later .\n\u201c There \u2019 s always an effort which is window dressing . There \u2019 s always an effort to make it appear that there \u2019 s going to be some genuine [ change ] , \u201d he says . \u201c But I \u2019 ve been living more than a minute now and I know better .

Texas and Indiana were the most active klan states in the country , and the group would parade hoodless down the city \u2019 s streets . Most of the sheriff \u2019 s and police departments were klan members , as was a co-founder of one of Fort Worth \u2019 s oldest law firms , according to Richard Selcer , a Fort Worth historian and author . Before they built the hall , the klan held meetings in the county courthouse basement .\nMr. Selcer says there were two lynchings in Fort Worth during this period : Rouse and Tom Vickery , a white man who killed a police officer . In both cases , klan members were implicated but the organization itself was not accused of anything .\nBy the late \u2019 20s the klan was losing membership , influence , and funds . Two years after raising enough money to rebuild the hall after a fire ( arson was never proved ) , the klan sold the building to a grocery . They had already been renting it out for public performances : Harry Houdini appeared there in 1924 . Over the years its roots faded from public memory . What became known as the North Main Street Auditorium served at various times as a dance hall , wrestling venue , boxing arena , and \u2013 from 1946 until 2000 \u2013 a factory for the Ellis Pecan Co .\n\u201c The klan hall name is on it , and will never be erased , but it was other things besides a klan hall for many , many more years , \u201d says Mr. Selcer . \u201c I \u2019 d love to see it saved . \u201d\nThat will , among other things , be an enormous financial ask . The building could cost more than $ 30 million to renovate , he estimates . The Fort Worth Military History Museum is also interested in moving into the building , but \u201c to save a building with that kind of money , you \u2019 ve got to have some deep-pocketed individual or group who really wants to save it , \u201d he adds .\nWhat happens when the stay of demolition expires is unclear .
