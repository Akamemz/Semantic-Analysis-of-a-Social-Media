Taking up what is called the STEM Jobs Act during the lame-duck session could be seen as a first step in that direction .\nThe House voted on a STEM bill -- standing for science , technology , engineering and mathematics -- in September , but under a procedure requiring a two-thirds majority . It was defeated , with more than 80 percent of Democrats voting against it , because it offset the increase in visas for high-tech graduates by eliminating another visa program that is available for less-educated foreigners , many from Africa .\nRepublicans are changing the formula this time by adding a provision long sought by some immigration advocates -- expanding a program that allows the spouses and minor children of people with permanent residence , or green card , to wait in the United States for their own green cards to be granted .\nThere are some 80,000 of these family-based green cards allocated every year , but there are currently about 322,000 husbands , wives and children waiting in this category and on average people must wait more than two years to be reunited with their families . In that past that wait could be as long as six years .\nThe House proposal would allow family members to come to the U.S. one year after they apply for their green cards , but they would n't be able to work until they actually got the card . It applies to the families of green card holders who marry after getting their residency permits .\nBruce Morrison , a former Democratic congressman who chaired the House immigration subcommittee and authored a 1990 immigration law , said the bill neither increases the number of green cards nor gives people green cards early . But people `` get the most important benefit of being able to live legally in the United States with their spouses . ''\nMorrison , an immigration policy lobbyist who advocates for groups such as American Families United , called the bill a stepping-stone to more comprehensive immigration reform , That Republicans initiated it `` to me is a positive gesture that they want to do business on this subject , '' he said .\nMegan Whittemore , spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , a key proponent of the STEM Act , said the bill is `` family friendly , helping spouses and minor children who would otherwise be separated from their families for extended periods of time . ''\nThe bill will be taken up this time under normal procedures requiring only a majority vote , and it is almost certain to pass the Republican-led House . It remains to be seen whether it will engender enough Democratic support to give it momentum as it heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate .\nIt would give 55,000 green cards a year to doctoral and masters graduates in the STEM fields . The measure , strongly backed by U.S. high-tech companies , would make it easier for people trained in the United States to put their skills to work for American companies rather than non-American competitors .\nBut the legislation would still eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery Program which gives out a similar 55,000 green cards a year to those from countries , including many in Africa , with traditionally low rates of immigration to the U.S. That prompted the House 's Hispanic Caucus , Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus to all come out against it in September .\nThe three caucuses said Republicans were trying to increase legal immigration for people they want by ending immigration for people they do n't want .\nCrystal Williams , executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association , said the bill is a message from Republicans that `` we are here and we are ready to talk about immigration reform .
