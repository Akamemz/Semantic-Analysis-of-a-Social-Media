In order to export uranium from the United States , Uranium One Inc. or ARMZ would need to apply for and obtain a specific NRC license authorizing the exports of uranium for use in reactor fuel , \u201d then-NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko wrote to Barrasso .\nThe NRC never issued an export license to the Russian firm , a fact so engrained in the narrative of the Uranium One controversy that it showed up in The Washington Post \u2019 s official fact-checker site this week . \u201c We have noted repeatedly that extracted uranium could not be exported by Russia without a license , which Rosatom does not have , \u201d the Post reported on Monday , linking to the 2011 Barrasso letter .\nYet NRC memos reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 show that it did approve the shipment of yellowcake uranium \u2014 the raw material used to make nuclear fuel and weapons \u2014 from the Russian-owned mines in the United States to Canada in 2012 through a third party . Later , the Obama administration approved some of that uranium going all the way to Europe , government documents show .\nNRC officials said they could not disclose the total amount of uranium that Uranium One exported because the information is proprietary . They did , however , say that the shipments only lasted from 2012 to 2014 and that they are unaware of any exports since then .\nNRC officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Uranium One exports flowed from Wyoming to Canada and on to Europe between 2012 and 2014 , and the approval involved a process with multiple agencies .\nRather than give Rosatom a direct export license \u2014 which would have raised red flags inside a Congress already suspicious of the deal \u2014 the NRC in 2012 authorized an amendment to an existing export license for a Paducah , Ky.-based trucking firm called RSB Logistics Services Inc. to simply add Uranium One to the list of clients whose uranium it could move to Canada .\nThe license , reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , is dated March 16 , 2012 , and it increased the amount of uranium ore concentrate that RSB Logistics could ship to the Cameco Corp. plant in Ontario from 7,500,000 kilograms to 12,000,000 kilograms and added Uranium One to the \u201c other parties to Export . \u201d\nOfficials at RSB , Cameco and Rosatom did not return repeated phone calls or emails seeking comment .\nUranium One 's American arm , however , emailed a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday evening confirming it did export uranium to Canada through the trucking firm and that 25 percent of that nuclear fuel eventually made its way outside North America to Europe and Asia , stressing all the exports complied with federal law .\n\u201c None of the US U308 product produced to date has been sold to non-US customers except for approximately 25 % which was sold via book transfer at the conversion facilities to customers from Western Europe and Asia , '' executive Donna Wickers said . \u201c Any physical export of the product from conversion facilities to non-US destinations is under the control of such customers and subject to NRC regulation . \u201d\nThe United States actually imports the majority of the uranium it uses as fuel . In 2016 , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , 24 percent of the imports came from Kazakhstan and 14 percent came from Russia .\nThe sale of Uranium One to a Russian state-owned firm , however , has created political waves that have led to multiple congressional investigations . Republicans say they want to learn how the sale could have been approved and whether there was political interference .\n\u201c The more that surfaces about this deal , the more questions it raises , '' Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles ( Chuck ) Ernest GrassleySpeaker Pelosi , it 's time to throw American innovators a lifeline Barr : Inspector general 's report on alleged FISA abuses 'imminent ' Pelosi aide hopeful White House will support drug-pricing bill despite criticism MORE ( R-Iowa ) said in a statement released after this story was published . Grassley , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , has launched an investigation into Uranium One .\n`` It now appears that despite pledges to the contrary , U.S. uranium made its way overseas as a part of the Uranium One deal , '' Grassley said in the statement . `` What \u2019 s more disturbing , those transactions were apparently made possible by various Obama Administration agencies while the Democrat-controlled Congress turned a blind eye .\n\u201c Americans deserve assurances that political influence was not a factor in all this . I \u2019 m increasingly convinced that a special counsel \u2014 someone with no prior involvement in any of these deals \u2014 should shine a light on this ordeal and get answers for the American people . \u201d\nGovernment officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the NRC was able to amend the export license affecting Uranium One because of two other decisions previously made by the Obama administration as part of a Russian \u201c reset \u201d in President Obama \u2019 s first term .\nFirst , Obama reinstated a U.S.-Russia civilian nuclear energy cooperation agreement . President George W. Bush had signed the agreement in 2008 , but withdrew from it before it could take effect after Russia became involved in a military conflict with the former Soviet republic of Georgia , a U.S. ally , and after new concerns surfaced that Moscow was secretly aiding Iran \u2019 s nuclear weapons ambitions .\nObama re-submitted the agreement for approval by the Democrat-controlled Congress in May 2010 , declaring Russia should be viewed as a friendly partner under Section 123 the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 after agreeing to a new nuclear weapons reduction deal and helping the U.S. with Iran .\n\u201c I have concluded : ( 1 ) that the situation in Georgia need no longer be considered an obstacle to proceeding with the proposed Agreement ; and ( 2 ) that the level and scope of U.S.-Russia cooperation on Iran are sufficient to justify resubmitting the proposed agreement to the Congress , \u201d Obama said in a statement sent to Congress .\nCongress took no action , which allowed the deal to become effective 90 days later .\nThe other step that allowed uranium from the Russian-controlled mines in the United States to be exported came in 2011 , when the Commerce Department removed Rosatom , Uranium One \u2019 s owner , from a list of restricted companies that could not export nuclear or other sensitive materials or technologies without special approval under the Export Administration Regulations .\n\u201c This final rule removes the Federal Atomic Power of Russia ( Rusatom ) now known as the Russian State Corporation of Atomic Energy ( Rosatom ) , \u201d the Commerce Department \u2019 s Bureau of Industry and Security declared in a May 24 , 2011 , notice in the Federal Register that created few waves .\nRosatom had been on the list for a long time , so long in fact that it was still listed in the federal database under its old name , Rusatom . Officials said the effort to remove the Russian nuclear firm was a \u201c policy decision \u201d driven by the State Department , Energy Department , Commerce Department and other agencies with Russia portfolios designed to recognize that bilateral relations between Russia and the United States had improved slightly .\nNine months after Rosatom was removed from the export restrictions list , the NRC issued its license amendment to the trucking firm in March 2012 that cleared the way for Uranium One exports , making it effective for nearly five years , to the end of 2017 . But the NRC also stipulated that Uranium One \u2019 s uranium should be returned to the United States .\n\u201c The uranium authorized for export is to be returned to the United States , \u201d the NRC instructed in the export license amendment .\nBut that , too , didn \u2019 t happen . Officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Energy Department subsequently gave approval for some of the American fuel to depart Canada and be exported to European enrichment centers , according to a 2015 letter the NRC sent to Rep. Pete Visclosky ( D-Ind . ) .\nThe NRC explained to Visclosky that it had originally stipulated that after the American uranium was treated in Canada , it had to \u201c then return the uranium to the U.S. for further processing . \u201d\n\u201c That license stated that the Canadian Government needed to obtain prior approval before any of the U.S. material could be transferred to any country other than the U.S. , \u201d the letter added . \u201c Subsequently the U.S. Department of Energy granted approval for some re-transfers of U.S. uranium from the Canadian conversion facilities to European enrichment plants . \u201d\nThe NRC added , however , it did not believe any of the American uranium made its way \u201c directly \u201d to Russia . And it added that the whole supply chain scenario was made possible by the resubmission of Obama \u2019 s Section 123 agreement in 2010 .\n\u201c The transfer of the U.S.-supplied uranium from Canada to Europe noted above also was subject to applicable Section 123 agreements , \u201d the NRC noted . Section 123 is the part of the Atomic Energy Act that allows for the U.S. to share civilian nuclear technology and goods with allies .\nThe Uranium One deal has been controversial since at least 2015 , when The New York Times reported former President Bill Clinton William ( Bill ) Jefferson ClintonGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Biden , Sanders , Warren , Buttigieg , Harris lead Trump in Georgia : Poll Keep your eye on essential facts in the unfolding impeachment circus MORE received a $ 500,000 speech fee from a Russian bank and millions in donations to his charitable foundation from sources interested in the deal around the time the Uranium One sale was being reviewed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton2020 Democrats make play for veterans ' votes The Memo : Democrats confront prospect of long primary Manafort sought to hurt Clinton 2016 campaign efforts in key states : NYT MORE \u2019 s State Department and eight other federal agencies .\nHillary Clinton has said she delegated the approval decision to a deputy on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) and did not apply any pressure .
