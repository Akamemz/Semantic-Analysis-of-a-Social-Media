    "content": "Publics around the world overwhelmingly agree that the news media should be unbiased in their coverage of political issues , according to a new \u2588\u2588\u2588 survey of 38 countries . Yet , when asked how their news media are doing on reporting different political issues fairly , people are far more mixed in their sentiments , with many saying their media do not deliver . And , in many countries , there are sharp political differences in views of the media \u2013 with the largest gap among Americans .\nTo build off \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s earlier findings about U.S. news media habits and attitudes , this new cross-national survey begins to study these dynamics globally . The survey finds that a median of 75 % across 38 countries say it is never acceptable for a news organization to favor one political party over others when reporting the news . Just 20 % say this is sometimes okay . People in Europe show the greatest opposition to political bias in their news , including 89 % in Spain and 88 % in Greece who think this is unacceptable . In the United States , 78 % say the news media should never favor one political party over another . In only five countries do at least three-in-ten believe it is okay to favor one side .\nWhat is a median ? Throughout this report , median percentages are used to help readers see overall patterns . The median is the middle number in a list of figures sorted in ascending or descending order . In a survey of 38 countries , the median result is the average of the 19th and 20th figures on a list of country-level findings ranked in order .\nIn addition to medians of respondents across the survey \u2019 s 38 countries , this report sometimes refers to the median among a specific subset of respondents and/or countries by region or economic grouping . For example , we can look at a median across the seven Asian-Pacific countries , where the median is the fourth figure when the countries are listed from highest to lowest . We can also calculate the medians across 10 European nations , five Middle East-North African nations , six sub-Saharan African nations and seven Latin American nations .\nWhile publics around the globe place a premium on politically unbiased news media , this is precisely the performance area , among four asked about , where publics are least likely to say their news media are doing well . A median of only 52 % across the 38 nations polled say the news media in their country do a good job of reporting on political issues fairly , while 44 % say they do not . And although majorities of the public in 18 countries say their news media are performing well in this area , attitudes are more negative in the remaining 20 nations surveyed . The most critical are Spain , Greece , South Korea , Lebanon and Chile , where at least six-in-ten say their news media do not do well on reporting the news fairly .\nNews media receive considerably higher marks in other performance areas . Broad majorities say their news media do a good job of covering the most important stories ( median of 73 % ) , reporting the news accurately ( 62 % ) , and reporting news about government leaders and officials ( 59 % ) . People in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific are more satisfied with their news media , while Latin Americans are the most critical . The U.S. public tends to fall roughly in the middle across the different performance areas asked about .\nNews media rated highest for covering important issues , lowest for reporting on politics fairly\nWithin countries , political identification tends to be the strongest divider of media attitudes , more so than education , age or gender .\nPolitical party systems vary considerably across countries , but one consistent measure for comparing political divides is support for the governing party or parties . Individuals who identify with the governing party or parties are categorized as supporters , everyone else as nonsupporters . In the U.S. , this means that people who identify with the Republican Party , which currently controls all branches of the federal government , are considered governing party supporters . People who identify with the Democratic Party , say they are independent , identify with some other party or do not identify with any political party are categorized as nonsupporters . ( For more details on the categorization , please see Appendix B . )\nUsing this approach , large gaps in ratings of the media emerge between governing party supporters and nonsupporters . On the question of whether their news media cover political issues fairly , for example , partisan differences appear in 20 of the 38 countries surveyed . In five countries , the gap is at least 20 percentage points , with the largest by far in the U.S. at 34 percentage points . The next highest partisan gap is in Israel , with a 26-point difference .\nThe U.S. is also one of only a few countries where governing party supporters are less satisfied with their news media than are nonsupporters . In most countries , people who support the political party currently in power are more satisfied with the performance of their news media than those who do not support the governing party . For example , in Sweden , the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party are the two parties that currently form the governing coalition in the country . About eight-in-ten Swedes ( 82 % ) who identify with these two parties say their news media do a good job of covering political issues fairly . Just 58 % of Swedes who do not identify with these two parties agree .\nThe partisan gaps found in the survey indicate that , rather than being consistently tied to a particular ideological position , satisfaction with the news media across the globe is more closely related to support for the party in power \u2013 whether that party is left or right . Public satisfaction with the news media also links closely to trust in one \u2019 s national government and a sense that the economy is doing well , which reinforces the point that , for most countries surveyed here , satisfaction with the media aligns with satisfaction on other country conditions rather than along a left-right spectrum .\nThese are among the major findings of a \u2588\u2588\u2588 survey conducted among 41,953 respondents in 38 countries from Feb. 16 to May 8 , 2017 . In addition to the topics discussed above , the study also focuses on individuals \u2019 use of the internet and social media to get news , as well as the types of news people follow .\nOnline news is making inroads in many countries around the world\nDigital technology is influencing news habits across the globe , though its use is still far from universal . Overall , a median of 42 % among the 38 countries surveyed say they get news on the internet at least once a day . In 14 countries , half or more adults get news online daily .\nIn general , internet access has been shown to be higher in wealthier countries , and this plays out to a greater likelihood of using the internet for news as well . For example , 61 % in Australia \u2013 which had a 2015 gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita of $ 46,271 \u2013 get news at least once a day through the internet . Just 20 % in Senegal , with a GDP per capita of $ 2,421 , do the same .\nThe survey also asked a separate question about how often people get news specifically on social media sites . Unlike getting news on the internet generally , the percentage that gets news on social media is not strongly related to country wealth . In fact , the median percentages of people who get news at least once a day through social media are about the same in emerging and developing economies as in advanced ones ( 33 % and 36 % , respectively ) . Overall , a global median of 35 % get news daily through social media , with the highest levels in South Korea ( 57 % ) , Lebanon ( 52 % ) and Argentina ( 51 % ) .\nWhat are advanced , emerging and developing countries ? For this report , we grouped countries into three economic categories : \u201c advanced , \u201d \u201c emerging \u201d and \u201c developing. \u201d In creating our economic classification of the countries in this report , we relied on multiple sources and criteria . Specifically , we were guided by : World Bank income classifications ; classifications of emerging markets by other multinational organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund ; per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) ; total size of the country \u2019 s economy , as measured by GDP ; and average GDP growth between 2010 and 2015 . For more information , see Appendix C .\nPublic is highly engaged with news , but more so with news that \u2019 s close to home\nOverall interest in the news has implications for how news media landscapes develop alongside technological change . Large majorities around the world say they follow national and local news closely ( global medians of 86 % and 78 % respectively ) . In all 38 countries , more than two-thirds say this of news about their own country . The same is true of news about their city or town in 32 countries .\nPeople are much less interested in news about other countries ( global median of 57 % ) . In only six countries do more than two-thirds say they pay close attention to news about the rest of the world . People outside of the U.S. express a similarly low level of interest in news specifically about the U.S. ( 48 % ) .\nYoung more likely to get news online ; older people more likely to follow the news overall\nAcross all 38 countries , young people \u2013 those ages 18 to 29 \u2013 are more likely to get news online than adults 50 and older . In 11 countries , the age gap is 35 percentage points or greater .\nAt the same time , older people tend to be more interested in the various types of news asked about than the younger generation . The biggest gaps are in news about one \u2019 s own city or town . In 20 countries , people ages 50 and older are significantly more likely than people younger than 30 to closely follow local news . The age gap is at least 15 percentage points in 11 of the countries . Only in the Philippines and Brazil is the pattern reversed ; there , young people are more likely to follow local news .\nFor international news , age is less of a factor . In general , men and those with more education are more likely to follow international news .",
