''\nTowering mountains can be seen , along with smooth plain-like areas and jumbled terrain Spencer could not immediately explain .\nHe described the mountains as `` quite spectacular , these are up to 11,000 feet high , there may be higher ones elsewhere . ''\n`` Now we know the surface of Pluto is covered in a lot of nitrogen ice , methane ice , carbon monoxide ice , '' he said . `` You ca n't make mountains out of that stuff . It 's just too soft , it does n't have the strength to make mountains . So we are seeing here the bedrock , or the bed-ice , of Pluto . ''\nWith a surface temperature of nearly 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit , `` water ice is strong enough ... to hold up big mountains , and that 's what we think we are seeing here , '' Spencer said . `` So the nitrogen and the methane are just a coating on top of this icy bedrock and we 're seeing that here . ''\nPluto is the first ice dwarf ever studied that does not orbit a gas giant like Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus or Neptune . Bodies orbiting the gas giants experience gravity-driven tidal stresses , generating internal heat that can , in turn , drive geological activity .\nCase in point : Neptune 's moon Triton , believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt body , which feartures geyser-like plumes spotted by NASA 's Voyager 2 probe during a 1989 flyby .\nCharon is not nearly massive enough to generate tidal heating .\n`` That ca n't happen at Pluto , there 's no giant body that can be deforming Pluto on an ongoing , regular basis to heat the interior , '' Spencer said . `` So this is telling us you do not need tidal heating to power ongoing recent geological activity on icy worlds . That 's a really important discovery that we made just this morning . ''\nSaid Stern : `` We 've settled the fact that these very small planets can be very active after a long time , and I think it 's going to send a lot of geophysicists back to the drawing board to try to understand how exactly you do that . ''\nHe said cryo-volcanism or geysers like those seen on Triton may be pulling volatiles like nitrogen , methane and carbon monoxide up from below the surface .

''\nIn the meantime , the science team has its hands full trying to understand what 's going on in the initial photos of Pluto 's surface .\n`` There 's been erosion , there 's been mountain building , there 's been whatever produces lumpy terrain with grooves on it , '' Spencer marveled . `` And it 's baffling . It 's baffling in a very interesting and wonderful way . ''",
