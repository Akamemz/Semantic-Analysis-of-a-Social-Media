    "content": "Sen. Rand Paul is about to announce that he 's running for president \u2014 kicking off a long-postponed Republican civil war on foreign policy .\nUnlike the rest of the likely GOP presidential field , Paul is a die-hard true believer in scaling down America 's involvement in conflicts around the world . That pits him against the mainstream , hawks in the Republican party whose ideas are sure to dominate the campaign . By running for president , Paul hopes to inject his ideas into the debate and shift priorities his party 's held for decades .\nPaul 's presence alone is a threat to people in the party establishment . The party 's most hawkish voices , fearing exactly this , are mobilizing in force to stop Paul \u2014 lobbying internally and even potentially running candidates whose sole purpose would be challenging Paul on foreign policy .\nThe coming campaign , then , is a major test of where the Republican Party view of foreign policy is heading .\nMake no mistake \u2014 Rand Paul is a true believer in a non-interventionist foreign policy\nPaul is pretty open about what he believes on foreign policy . It 's a simple pitch : no more foreign wars and less government involvement in our lives in the name of security . It also happens to be 180 degrees from what most other Republicans think .\nPaul supports nuclear negotiations with Iran ( though he 's been conspicuously quiet about the recently announced framework deal ) . He 's tacitly endorsed the Obama approach to Russia and Ukraine , and has vociferously opposed NSA surveillance .\nHe 's blasted both the Afghanistan surge and the Libya intervention . Today , he opposes arming the Syrian rebels to fight ISIS or Bashar al-Assad .\n`` After the tragedies of Iraq and Libya , Americans are right to expect more from their country when we go to war , '' Paul said in an October speech widely seen as an outline of his 2016 foreign policy platform .\nPaul often builds conservative cred for these ideas by couching them as critiques of Democrats . In his recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee , for example , he bashed `` Hillary 's war in Libya '' for ushering in chaos that helped jihadi groups flourish .\nThis is a standard non-interventionist argument \u2014 America 's allegedly humanitarian wars often produce terrible unintended consequences \u2014 that also implicitly criticizes Republican hawks . But because it 's couched as an attack on Democrats , it can play with Republicans .\nPaul 's seeming deviations from his line are usually part of a bigger plan\nPaul will occasionally do something that makes it seem like he 's moving in a more hawkish direction . Sometimes that 's a sop to political necessity . Paul used to call for zeroing out US aid to Israel \u2014 an extremely unpopular position in the GOP that he 's now reversed .\nBut other times , it 's a fakeout . Paul learned from his father , former Rep. Ron Paul , that refusing to compromise or tailor your libertarian message at all will simply lead to marginalization inside the GOP . Instead , he 's developed a more subtle strategy : repurpose classic Republican positions and tactics to endorse non-interventionist , rather than hawkish , views about foreign policy .\nTake a recent amendment on defense spending . Paul , a longtime critic of wasteful defense spending , proposed a larger defense budget \u2014 shocking even stalwart libertarians .\nBut Paul was n't mounting a serious campaign to hike defense spending . The amendment was designed to embarrass hawkish Sen. Marco Rubio , a likely primary rival . Paul 's amendment proposed increasing spending by the exact same amount as one Rubio had proposed earlier , only Paul paid for it with other domestic spending cuts , which Rubio did n't .\n`` This amendment is to lay down a marker that if you believe we need more funding for national defense , you should show how you would pay for it , '' Doug Stafford , a senior Paul adviser , told Reason . The whole thing was a stunt designed to show that increasing defense spending requires tradeoffs from any Republican who 's serious about the debt .\nPaul 's nomination could have a tectonic impact on American foreign policy\nPaul is basically alone on these issues in the primary .
