But it hurts, at least in how the public sees it and how the critics can talk about it.\n\nPolls have already shown that Americans still don\u2019t know much and have a lot of misperceptions about the 3-year-old law. This won\u2019t help, particularly with the critics emboldened to talk about chaotic implementation of a fatally flawed policy.\n\nThe administration insists that the new health insurance exchanges or marketplaces will start enrollment on time this Oct. 1. A lot more people will get covered in those new markets than through the employer mandate, which wasn\u2019t as central to the coverage push because most big businesses already offer health benefits. But it could mean that fewer people do get coverage next year.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 alarmist quotes on health law ruling)\n\nThe announcement gave fresh ammunition to GOP opponents.\n\nRepublicans used it to again say that the law should be repealed and replaced. Repeal won\u2019t happen as long as President Barack Obama\u2019s in the White House, but some groups on Tuesday renewed their calls for defunding the health law \u2013 a throwback to congressional fights in the previous Congress.

Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Health Committee.\n\nWill more health law dominos fall?\n\nOne immediate question people were asking: Is this the only delay the Obama administration will be announcing? Or is it the first in a line of dominos \u2014 with the individual mandate being the most important domino. After all, the administration has already delayed until 2015 a key feature in the small-business exchanges that would have given workers more choice in health plans.\n\nAnd the individual mandate is a prime target for opponents who can say, why should big companies get out of confounding Obamacare rules if an average citizen cannot?\n\nThe White House put up a blog post stressing that the main elements of the law will be ready to go in October.
