And he reminded us as well that this is a pretty effective formula for success in American politics .\nFrom his opening ( if belated ) words condemning recent acts of anti-Semitism to his promises to cut two regulations for every new one created to his highlighting the widow of a Navy SEAL , Trump dealt mainly in rhetorical gestures .\nBut people who criticize Trump for dealing in such gestures and for offering few specifics forget that public leadership depends on symbols . More than that , it depends on setting a simple vision and animating it with symbols and with stories . Like it or not , Trump is good at that .\nThis speech was his most effective moment as president . It played to his natural strengths -- performance and theatricality -- while keeping his liabilities , like cynical incuriosity and casual cruelty , at bay . More than that , with talk of infrastructure investment and hints at immigration reform , it showed his willingness to keep both left and right off-balance . It hinted at the trouble Democrats would be in if Trump could ever sustain discipline .\nUnfortunately for him , the rest of his job requires him to face the world in its actual complexity -- and to deliver .

But Trump failed to lay out a specific path to achieve his policy objectives . It is just as mathematically impossible today to keep health care coverage for pre-existing conditions , repeal the Obamacare mandate and lower costs as it was yesterday . He did not make any tough choices on how exactly to achieve tax reform where tax cuts to the middle class are not impacted . And he did not present a new strategy for going after ISIL .\nThe audience is the American people at home , but more than five weeks into the administration it is also the people in the room .

We all bleed the same blood . We all salute the same American flag . And we all are made by the same God . ''\nHis words reflected the American ethos . But , sadly , unifying , benevolent messages like extending treatment for Americans addicted to drugs were met with Democratic recalcitrance , as left-wing elected officials sat firmly planted on one side of the House chamber , where clapping was sparse .\nDemocratic resistance could not squelch the overriding message of unity , best represented by the emotional moment when Trump saluted Carryn Owens , wife of fallen Navy SEAL Ryan Owens , reminding us that , `` the Bible teaches us , there is no greater act of love than to lay down one 's life for one 's friends .

This was a crucial move from a president who has been dodging acknowledgment of the growing number of hate crimes .\nThe commander-in-chief 's straightforward presentation was also a departure from his usual bombastic style .

Without creating a source of revenue to make up for it -- Trump has vowed to cut taxes , not raise them -- the budget could wind up becoming significantly imbalanced .\nTrump might not find a friend in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , either .

Since 9/11 , twice as many people have been killed by white supremacists than terrorists claiming to be Muslims . Indeed , anti-Muslim hate groups have nearly tripled since 2015 . And these white supremacists have been terrorizing Muslims ( and other racial minorities ) through mosque vandalization , assault , and even murder .\nWhile Trump rightfully acknowledged the rise in hate crimes against Jewish communities , he was resoundingly silent about the rise in attacks and discrimination against American Muslims . Even his mention of the shooting in Kansas City left out that the victims were apparently mistaken for Muslim . Trump 's material omissions demonstrate that he did not have American Muslims in mind when he stated `` We are one people , with one destiny . We all bleed the same blood .

'' Trump in car : Boy am I really out on a limb on this one ; I said in my inaugural that I 'd eradicate ISIS from the face of the earth .

'' Trump in car : I do n't care what my new National Security Adviser wants me to say , I 'm going to keep on using those three words until the cows come home . It makes me feel good ; and I do n't care if it alienates American Muslims here or our so-called Arab allies abroad .

'' Trump in car : Boy do I love that line . To all you liberal interventionists and neocons who somehow think I belong to the `` US as the indispensable power '' club , think again . No more globaloney . It 's America first . I 'm looking out for number one . And you know who that is .\nA lengthy standing ovation honoring American hero Ryan Owens and led by Donald Trump allowed him to demonstrate , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that he is President and Commander in Chief for all Americans- no ifs , no ands , no buts .\nTo say that President Donald Trump 's joint session speech was optimistic is an understatement . The more than hour-long address was filled with references to renewal of the American spirit . Trump spoke of unity , with a heartfelt tribute to Black History Month , condemned attacks on Jewish Community Centers and cemeteries , and the recent apparent hate killing in Kansas .\nDemocrats sat on their hands for much of the speech , even during talk of a $ 1 trillion infrastructure spending package .

Trump opened his first congressional address with a rhetorical flourish that noted the last day of Black History Month as a time to reflect on the nation 's past progress toward civil rights , marred by a recent uptick in anti-Semitism that may well be at least partially a result of the divisive language used by the President himself . What the President touted as a `` renewal of American spirit '' is actually a period that has been marked by a resurgence of racism , xenophobia , religious intolerance , and attacks on LGBTQ communities .\nLike champions of Brexit , Trump doubled down on his nation building rhetoric Tuesday night , with a promise to rebuild long decayed industries and `` make America great again .

These he claims will jumpstart an American economy that has already seen steady , but relatively constrained , growth since the great recession .\nThe president repeated his campaign promise to build a `` great wall '' along the nation 's southern border in an effort to defend the homeland against , what he has repeatedly called the `` bad hombres . ''\nThreats from terrorists , illegal immigrants , and drug cartels formed the core of a presidential speech that trafficked in fear as the fuel for a renewal of the American Dream . The President ratcheted up his law and order rhetoric by parading victims of immigration crimes in the gallery , in a shameless act of exploitation designed to further mass incarceration . It was a divisive , intolerant , and ultimately dangerous speech from a president content to serve more as a demagogue than inspirational leader of the world 's greatest democracy .\nPeniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the Founding Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin .\nFaced with a shocking murder in Kansas , which appears to have been an anti-immigrant hate crime , and waves of anti-Semitic incidents across the country , Donald Trump seemed for a moment to have been affected by the weight of the presidency as he opened his speech to Congress . America 's civil rights business was unfinished , he allowed , and he seemed to call upon our better angels to get it done . It was , a new Trump . Almost . Moments later we got back the old Trump , the one who is more comfortable with fear than with hope .\nWith references to crime-ridden cities , `` lawless chaos '' and `` gang members , drug dealers , and criminals '' Trump evoked a crime wave that does n't exist , except in his rhetoric . He blamed America 's problems , from low wages to the decline of manufacturing jobs on undocumented immigrants and promised anew to build a `` great , great wall '' along the southern border .\nWith repeated references to `` I '' and `` my '' and `` me , '' Trump flashed his lifelong narcissism and reassured the nation that at least he is consistent . With so many warlike references and the promise of a new fortress America , walled off and fearful , we returned to Trump 's true inner reality . It 's a mental landscape worthy of Game of Thrones .\nMichael D'Antonio is the author of `` Never Enough : Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success . ''",

These he claims will jumpstart an American economy that has already seen steady, but relatively constrained, growth since the great recession.\n\nThe president repeated his campaign promise to build a \"great wall\" along the nation's southern border in an effort to defend the homeland against, what he has repeatedly called the \"bad hombres.\"\n\nThreats from terrorists, illegal immigrants, and drug cartels formed the core of a presidential speech that trafficked in fear as the fuel for a renewal of the American Dream. The President ratcheted up his law and order rhetoric by parading victims of immigration crimes in the gallery, in a shameless act of exploitation designed to further mass incarceration. It was a divisive, intolerant, and ultimately dangerous speech from a president content to serve more as a demagogue than inspirational leader of the world's greatest democracy.\n\nPeniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Political Values and Ethics and the Founding Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nMichael D'Antonio: A 'Game of Thrones' mental landscape\n\nMichael D'Antonio\n\nFaced with a shocking murder in Kansas, which appears to have been an anti-immigrant hate crime, and waves of anti-Semitic incidents across the country, Donald Trump seemed for a moment to have been affected by the weight of the presidency as he opened his speech to Congress. America's civil rights business was unfinished, he allowed, and he seemed to call upon our better angels to get it done. It was, a new Trump. Almost. Moments later we got back the old Trump, the one who is more comfortable with fear than with hope.\n\nWith references to crime-ridden cities, \"lawless chaos\" and \"gang members, drug dealers, and criminals\" Trump evoked a crime wave that doesn't exist, except in his rhetoric. He blamed America's problems, from low wages to the decline of manufacturing jobs on undocumented immigrants and promised anew to build a \"great, great wall\" along the southern border.\n\nWith repeated references to \"I\" and \"my\" and \"me,\" Trump flashed his lifelong narcissism and reassured the nation that at least he is consistent. With so many warlike references and the promise of a new fortress America, walled off and fearful, we returned to Trump's true inner reality. It's a mental landscape worthy of Game of Thrones.\n\nMichael D'Antonio is the author of \"Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success.\"",
