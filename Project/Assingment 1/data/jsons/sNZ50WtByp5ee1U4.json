    "content_original": "In The Arena Obamacare Is Anything But Compassionate\n\nBobby Jindal is governor of Louisiana.\n\nThe verdict is in, and it\u2019s not good: Obamacare is rippling through the U.S. economy with vast implications for American prosperity.\n\nOn Friday, we learned that the Obama economy has hit stall speed, with a paltry 113,000 jobs added in January.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTwo days earlier, we learned the president\u2019s health care law is discouraging Americans from working, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office . The report makes for bracing reading. The law will reduce the labor supply by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers, the CBO says \u2014 up from an estimated 800,000 just three years ago.\n\nIt gets worse. The CBO also concluded that the law\u2019s \u201cexpanded Medicaid eligibility \u2026 will, on balance, reduce incentives to work.\u201d Think about that: Obamacare is giving low-income Americans fewer reasons to work \u2014 to find and pursue the jobs that could transform their lives and the lives of those around them. The president talks a lot about tackling inequality. But his health care law is a recipe for increasing inequality, not decreasing it.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion doesn\u2019t just discourage work; it also prioritizes coverage for able-bodied adults over the needs of persons with disabilities. That\u2019s a dirty little secret the Obama administration and its liberal allies, in their rush to expand government-funded health coverage to millions more Americans, won\u2019t tell you.
