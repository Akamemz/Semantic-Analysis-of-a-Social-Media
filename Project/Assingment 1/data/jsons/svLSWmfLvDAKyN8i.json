    "content": "CLOSE Democrats have midterms momentum , but remember 2016 and do n't get comfortable , says columnist Paul Brandus . \u2588\u2588\u2588\nDemocrats warn that the midterm elections Tuesday will undermine the future of America 's democracy unless President Donald Trump 's authoritarian instincts are curtailed . Republicans argue that the nation 's sovereignty is at risk if Democrats prevail .\n`` Fear is the dominant issue , bar none , '' said Jeffrey Engel , director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University .\nThat 's particularly remarkable because the economy is strong and the nation does n't face an instant foreign policy crisis , although there are trouble spots around the world . Instead of a sense of peace and prosperity , the final weeks of the campaign have been dominated by violence and conflict : the mass murder of worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue , the mailing of improvised explosive devices to more than a dozen leading Democrats , the images of a caravan of Central American asylum seekers making their way across southern Mexico .\nThe campaign has crystallized clashing visions of what defines the nation : America First or an increasingly diverse population ?\n`` The character of our country is on the ballot , '' declared former President Barack Obama , back on the stump in Miami .\n`` If you do n't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans , '' President Trump warned at a rally in Missouri , `` you better vote Republican . ''\nSince his inauguration two years ago , the president has united his party and inflamed the opposing one . Though he is n't on the ballot , he is at the center of both the conflict and its consequences . The midterm results will shape the second two years of his term and set the landscape for the re-election campaign that already is underway .\nMore : Election Day is almost here . Here 's what you need to know before you cast your midterm ballot .\nAlso : Here are the candidates poised to make history Nov. 6\nRelated : These Democrats could make Trump 's life miserable if they win the House in the midterms\nCalamitous language is n't exactly new to American politics , and the assertion that just about every election is crucial has become a political trope . But the 2018 midterms have been the most combustible in more than a generation . The arguments are fiercer and the lines more sharply drawn than even those marked by clashes over war ( Vietnam in 1966 , Iraq in 2006 ) and scandal ( Watergate in 1974 , impeachment in 1998 ) .\n`` One electorate has its hair on fire and thinks that Donald Trump is a threat to the republic , '' Lawrence Jacobs , director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota , said of Democrats . `` For Republicans , there 's an ominous warning about chaos , that the resistance movement will be the breakdown of law and order . ''\nOne sign of this year 's high passions is the rise in early voting in states from Arizona to Wisconsin . By early Sunday , political scientist Michael McDonald of the University of Florida had counted a record 34.3 million people who had voted by absentee or mail ballot or at early voting stations . In the last midterm election , in 2014 , 20.5 million voted early ; this year 's total may be close to double that .\nIn an incendiary closing argument , Trump spotlighted a web video created by his campaign that accused Democrats of complicity in the deaths of two California sheriff 's deputies who were killed by an undocumented Mexican immigrant , who is shown mocking police in court . `` Who else would Democrats let in ? '' the ad asks . ( Court records show his case was handled primarily by Republicans . )\nCritics accused Trump of exploiting the nation 's racial divisions , exaggerating the threat from undocumented immigrants and misusing the powers of his office by vowing to ban birthright citizenship by executive order and by dispatching thousands of military troops to the southern border to repel the immigrants ' caravan , which \u2013 traveling on foot \u2013 is weeks away from reaching the USA .\nRep. Bennie Thompson , D-Miss. , in line to chair the Homeland Security Committee if Democrats win control of the House of Representatives , called the president 's threats `` a political stunt aimed at whipping up fear and xenophobia just days before the election . ''\nThe election returns will direct but wo n't dissipate the nation 's political heat . If Democrats win a majority in the House , as nonpartisan analysts and strategists on both sides predict , they will gain the authority to launch vigorous congressional oversight of the Trump administration in general and the president in particular .\nDemocrats hope to win governorships held by Republicans in Rust Belt states that were key in electing Trump \u2013 Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . A half-dozen other states that have GOP governors have competitive contests , from swing states such as Florida and Iowa to traditional Republican strongholds in Georgia and Kansas .\nVictories in state capitols will have repercussions for congressional redistricting after the 2020 Census and during the 2020 campaign , when presidential nominees could benefit from friendly governors ' statewide standing and their political organizations .\nOne thing at stake in this election , then , is the next one .\nMore : Midterms : Races for governor , statehouses will help decide control of Congress for a decade\nTrump and other Republicans are increasingly optimistic that the GOP will maintain control of the Senate , perhaps even bolstering its 51-seat majority . `` I know we 're doing well in the Senate , '' Trump boasted , though on Friday , he acknowledged for the first time that Republicans could lose the House . `` It could happen , '' he said at a rally in Huntington , West Virginia .\nTen Democratic-held Senate seats on the ballot are in states that Trump carried in 2016 , some by double-digit margins . That has put Democrats on the defensive in Indiana , Missouri , Montana and North Dakota , and it has made winning Senate control an uphill struggle .\nIn contrast , many of the most crucial House battlegrounds are in suburban districts where many college-educated voters , especially women , have been repelled by Trump 's disruptive rhetoric and his hard-line policies toward immigrants and others . Democrats need a net gain of at least 23 seats to take control .\nThe split decision \u2013 if Democrats flip the House while Republicans hold the Senate \u2013 would give each side bragging rights . GOP partisans would focus on the Senate outcome as `` a huge validation '' of Trump , Charlie Cook of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted , and Democratic partisans would argue that the House takeover was `` a huge repudiation '' of him .\n`` Everybody wakes up the next morning happy because they heard what they wanted to hear , '' Cook said .\nUp for election Tuesday are all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats . Governors will be elected in 36 states and three territories , as will state legislators across the country . Mayoral contests will be held in 27 of the nation 's 100 biggest cities , among them Louisville , Kentucky ; Nashville , Tennessee ; Newark , New Jersey ; Phoenix ; Reno , Nevada ; San Francisco ; and Washington .\nMore : Young voter turnout in midterm elections is often dismal .

Michigan and Minnesota are poised to elect the first Muslim women to Congress .\nAn unprecedented number of women have been nominated by the major parties for office this year , in part spurred by opposition to Trump and by the # MeToo movement .
