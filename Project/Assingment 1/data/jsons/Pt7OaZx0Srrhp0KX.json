All three issues -- and especially abortion -- were considered a conversational dead-end , on which nearly all intelligent adults have already made up their minds .\nAny sort of abortion `` debate '' would inevitably turn into a shoutfest yielding circular arguments , bad feelings and bored listeners .\nI thought about that rule of thumb as I read about the elaborate media hoax ginned up by the Center for Medical Progress , a right-wing group trying to discredit and defund Planned Parenthood .\nTaking a page from the falsehoods and selectively-edited videos that brought about the defunding and bankruptcy of the left-wing advocacy group ACORN , the Center for Medical Progress strategy is to create a narrative , claim that its videos constitute damning evidence , and repeat that story enough times to give politicians the `` proof '' they need to attack Planned Parenthood .\nThat plan appears to have fizzled already , with the failure of a Senate vote this week to defund Planned Parenthood .
