We need to step up , help our neighbors , donate gear , vote , wear red white and blue , volunteer , fund aid organizations , and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis . We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need .\nYang , who came to this conclusion after an unsettling experience of his own , appears to believe that contributing civically in a visible way is the best approach to respond to acts of prejudice .\nWhile it \u2019 s entirely fair for him to want to confront such biases in his own way , the application of his reasoning is where things get concerning . There \u2019 s certainly a worthwhile case to be made that everyone , regardless of their background , should be stepping up and helping their communities during this devastating crisis . But Yang \u2019 s point is specifically aimed at Asian Americans .\nIn fact , he suggests that Asian Americans , as a group , need to demonstrate that they are positive contributors to society just to be treated as equals .
