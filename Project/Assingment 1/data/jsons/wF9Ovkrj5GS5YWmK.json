From Brexit to Brasilia , from the District of Columbia to the Danube , leaders are ruling from the further reaches of the political spectrum . In today \u2019 s belligerent global mood , is there any fruitful ground for a moderate politician to plow ?\nStarbucks founder Howard Schultz thinks so ; he says the U.S. two-party system is broken , and he \u2019 s planning an independent bid for the presidency . In London , 11 centrist members of Parliament who broke away from the Conservative and Labour parties last month think the same thing as they consider founding a new party .\nPolls suggest that a centrist coalition could unseat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in next month \u2019 s general elections , while in France President Emmanuel Macron is still battling to justify voters \u2019 faith in his brand of centrism .\nAre these the tentative hints of a new direction , a sign that the populist pendulum may have swung its full arc ? Or are they destined to be crushed by angry voters seeking radical solutions from demagogues ?\n\u201c The problem with centrism is that its style of moderation and compromise is not in fashion at the moment , \u201d says Pascal Perrineau , a veteran French political analyst . \u201c But its strength is that it seeks solutions beyond the tired old left-right divide . One can imagine new political space emerging from the wreckage of the old system . \u201d\nThat seems to be Mr. Schultz \u2019 s hope . He says that the two-party duopoly that has long ruled the United States is now a broken system and that \u201c it \u2019 s time for a centrist candidate not affiliated with either party to be president . \u201d\nGiven the intensity of partisanship in today \u2019 s America , and the structure of the Electoral College , his chances of success look slim . But a moderate running on the Democratic ticket , such as former Vice President Joe Biden , Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , or two-term Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper , might be better placed to capture and harness the middle ground .\n\u201c There \u2019 s certainly a place \u201d for moderates in national politics , says Seth Masket , director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver , in an email .\n\u201c Between Trump \u2019 s behavior and the progressive policies of many of the leading Democratic candidates , more moderate voters may feel they don \u2019 t have great options , and they might see someone like Hickenlooper providing one , \u201d Dr. Masket says .\nBoth parties have been pulling away from the center for a number of years . Conservatives dominate the Republican Party at all levels , and it is liberals such as new Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York who are providing the Democrats with energy and policy ideas such as the Green New Deal .\nThree-quarters of Republican voters call themselves conservatives , and just over half of Democrats describe themselves as liberal \u2013 up from 38 percent in 2008 , when Barack Obama was first elected president .\nModerate candidates in both parties are few and far between , says Danielle Thomsen , author of \u201c Opting Out of Congress : Partisan Polarization and the Decline of Moderate Candidates . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 re just not running for office at the same rate \u201d as liberals or conservatives , her research has found . \u201c That \u2019 s really changed dramatically , \u201d she says . \u201c Now they \u2019 re only about three or four percent \u201d of each party \u2019 s candidates .\nWhen they do run , they face the sort of challenge that a presidential candidate such as Mr. Biden would be up against : how to fashion a campaign platform that appeals to all the diverse types of moderate in the U.S. political landscape .\nPolling by Pew Research Data has found that white voters without a college degree make up 30 percent of Democratic moderates and conservatives , black voters comprise 22 percent , Latinos 21 percent , and white college graduates 16 percent .\nMr. Biden appears potentially capable of appealing to a wide range of demographics , but his main asset as a moderate \u2013 and an asset just as important as any particular policy \u2013 is his avuncular , genial style . In today \u2019 s America , moderation of demeanor and rhetoric could be the key to any centrist presidential candidate \u2019 s chance of success .\nAs general elections draw near in Israel , there is clearly a growing appetite for such an approach in that country , where the tone of political discourse has grown increasingly bitter over the 10-year rule of hard-line , right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .\nFor the first time , the principal division in the country is not between Jews and Arabs but between left-wing and right-wing Jews , according to a recent study by the Israel Democracy Institute , a leading think tank .\nSeeking to bridge that gap is the new \u201c Blue and White \u201d party , created by a merger of two centrist parties and named for the colors of the Israeli flag . The latest polls put the newcomer ahead of all rivals in the elections next month , as the leftist camp shrinks and moderate right-wingers desert Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s Likud party .\nBlue and White is tapping a sentiment that Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s divisive rhetoric , such as his attacks on the media and the criminal justice system , has gone too far , say analysts .\n\u201c There is an agreement among those on the left and some on the right that the incitement has to stop , that it is not OK to call left-wingers traitors , as has been legitimized by this government , \u201d says Gayil Talshir , who teaches politics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem .\nPollsters have found that while Israeli voters still care about security and peace , they are increasingly concerned by more day-to-day matters . Blue and White , led by a retired general , has serious security credentials but is also focusing on education , health care , public transport , and the cost of living , says Asaf Zamir , one of the new party \u2019 s parliamentary candidates : \u201c We have to speak about bread and butter issues . \u201d\nThose are just the sort of issues that moderate Conservatives and moderate Labour Party members in Britain are longing to get their teeth into whenever the Brexit debate is over and politicians can get back to normal life .\n\u201c The vast majority of people \u2026 want answers that improve their daily lives rather than angry , adversarial rhetoric , \u201d says Will Tanner , the young founder of \u201c Onward , \u201d a reformist Conservative Party think tank in London .\nThe leaders of both main British parties \u201c are setting people against each other , \u201d says Stephanie Lloyd , deputy director of Progress , a centrist pressure group within the Labour Party . \u201c The two-party system works if both are broad church , but they are hardening into singular ideologies . \u201d\nDoes this mean there is room for a new party in the middle ? That is what The Independent Group is betting . Its 11 members \u2013 three former Conservative and eight former Labour members of Parliament \u2013 are united by their fears that their parties risk being dominated by extremists . Having broken away from their old parties , they are currently considering creating a new one .\nPolls show that , between them , The Independent Group and the Liberal Democrats ( a traditional centrist party ) command more electoral support than any party other than the ruling Conservatives .\nIt is very early days , but Nora Mulready hopes that the new grouping will inject \u201c more of the moral and pragmatic essence of centrism \u201d into British politics . Ms. Mulready , a former Labour party activist , is making a series of films designed to stimulate moderate debate of controversial issues to generate ideas to challenge extremist viewpoints .\nIf centrists are to seize the time , they need to go on the offensive , agrees Ms. Lloyd . \u201c The center left has ignored a series of challenges for a long time , \u201d she says , notably the question of immigration . \u201c We never made the argument that it is a good thing because we were scared to do so , and that created a vacuum that the extreme right filled . \u201d\nWhether The Independent Group has a future may depend on how the Labour Party and the Conservative Party react , says Sheri Berman , who teaches European politics at Barnard College in New York . \u201c Sometimes breakaway groups remind established parties that there \u2019 s a problem , and they recalibrate , \u201d Professor Berman says . But such a recalibration would nonetheless put more political weight in the center .\nThat is not , however , the way that traditional centrist parties in Germany are behaving .\nThe center-right Christian Democrats ( CDU ) and center-left Social Democrats ( SPD ) have been hard to distinguish recently , wedded as they are in a \u201c grand coalition \u201d government that ties them to the same policies .\nVoters , dissatisfied with the lack of choice that the two mainstream parties are offering them , have been flocking at recent elections to more extreme groups , notably the far-right Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) and to a lesser extent The Left party , which sits at the far left of German politics .\nThe CDU and the SPD are now seeking to stanch the flow with firmer policies appealing to their traditional supporters . The CDU is taking a less tolerant attitude to immigration than it did when Germany welcomed over 1 million migrants in 2015-16 , while the SPD is proposing hikes in the minimum wage and in pensions .\nAs they harden their identities , the Greens are proving the big centrist success story .\nOnce dismissed as pacifist tree-huggers , the Greens have found political strength in centrism as they have moved to the middle with new policies while keeping their environmental principles intact . Greens are as firmly opposed to Russian aggression in Ukraine as anyone , support armed intervention abroad to defend human rights , and have pushed for more spending on infrastructure and education .\n\u201c From the left , the Greens have moved to the center to make themselves attractive to CDU and SPD voters , \u201d says Gero Neugebauer , a politics professor at the Free University of Berlin .\nThe move has worked ; the Greens are seen as reliable coalition partners by both the CDU and the SPD , and they are members of nine regional governments .\nAt the same time , a third of German voters say they sympathize with anti-establishment views . That trend clearly benefits the AfD and the Left party , but the Greens appear to have enough \u201c alternative \u201d street cred to profit as well . After all , populism is not an exclusively extremist phenomenon .\nTake French President Emmanuel Macron \u2019 s successful 2017 campaign at the head of the brand new En Marche ! ( In Motion ! ) party , for example , which betrayed more than a hint of Donald Trump-style populism . Both Mr. Macron and Mr. Trump ran as outsiders against their respective political establishments and won .\nMr. Macron campaigned on a resolutely centrist platform based on a strong European Union , a social market economy , and a culture of compromise . Sometimes he described it as \u201c neither left nor right \u201d and sometimes as \u201c both left and right . \u201d\nHis platform clearly contributed to his victory , but it was not the only factor . \u201c Eighteen months on , I realize that people did not necessarily vote for Macron because of his ideas ; \u2026 they voted for change , \u201d acknowledges Delphine O , an En Marche ! member of parliament .\n\u201c Macron \u2019 s strength lay as much in who he was not as in who he was , \u201d says Professor Perrineau . He won because the French public was fed up with the two main parties \u2013 the Socialists on the left and the Republicans on the right \u2013 which had alternated in power for decades .\nIt is because voters have not yet seen the results of the changes in economic and social policy that Mr. Macron had promised that his government is facing so much social unrest , says Professor Berman .\n\u201c He said he would reinvigorate French capitalism and strengthen social protection , \u201d she says . \u201c But he can not yet claim success on either part of his program . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThat bodes ill for Macron \u2019 s brand of centrism . \u201c If European governments can not reinvigorate their economies and also take care of those citizens who have fallen behind , \u201d she says , \u201c that could be very dangerous for democracy . \u201d\n\u2022 Peter Grier in Washington , Clifford Coonan in Berlin , and Dina Kraft in Tel Aviv , Israel , contributed reporting to this story .",
