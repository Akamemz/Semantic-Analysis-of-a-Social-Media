''\nJulia is a dedicated student with dreams to one day attend Harvard University . She loves to read and has a passion for science . Her hard work has earned her a spot on the honor roll , but Julia was n't always getting the most out of class .\n`` There was a point in my elementary school where I did have a few ineffective teachers , '' Julia explains . `` It was definitely scary when I figured out that I was n't learning because it took a lot of courage to go to my parents and tell them . ''\nJulia told her dad , Joe Macias , about her struggles with math in her second grade class . Concerned about his daughter 's eroding confidence in school , Joe and his wife decided to go to the school to meet with the teacher , where they were told that their daughter just was n't good at math and advised to have her tested for a learning disability . Joe and his wife went back to observe the class and found that the teacher was unprepared and unorganized . They switched Julia to a different class , where she flourished .\n`` She 's coming home excited doing her work , '' says Joe . `` And I thought what can you attribute that to because this is the same kid . But the settings changed . Different teacher . ''\nThe Macias ' experience with ineffective teachers led them to join eight other students and become part of the landmark Vergara v. California lawsuit that challenged teacher job protections .\nThe case took on labor statutes that make it difficult to get rid of underperforming teachers , including the permanent employment statute , which gives a teacher tenure after just 16 months on the job . It also took on dismissal statutes which make firing a low performing teacher almost impossible and the last-in , first-out rule which forces districts to lay off teachers based on seniority , not performance .\n`` In California , the teacher tenure system is really an outlier among various states in the nation , '' says Joshua Lipshutz , an attorney with Gibson , Dunn , & Crutcher in San Francisco , California who argued on behalf on the Vergara plaintiffs . `` Most states have a tenure period of three to five years and a few states do n't have tenure at all .
