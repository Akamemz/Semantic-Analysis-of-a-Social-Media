    "content": "The reality of a contested convention has become more real than ever , with Donald Trump facing the risk of losing Wisconsin next week , meaning he \u2019 d have to win roughly 60 percent of the remaining delegates to win the Republican presidential nomination outright .\nIf Trump heads into the convention without the magic number of 1,237 , already more than a hundred delegates are poised to break with him on a second ballot , according to interviews with dozens of delegates , delegate candidates , operatives and party leaders .\nIn one of the starkest examples of Trump \u2019 s lack of support , out of the 168 Republican National Committee members \u2014 each of whom doubles as a convention delegate \u2014 only one publicly supports Trump , and she knows of only a handful of others who support him privately .\nMeanwhile , Ted Cruz has been whipping Trump in the quiet , early race to elect his own loyalists to become delegates to the convention , meaning that the Texas senator could triumph through delegates who are freed to vote their own preferences on a second ballot , regardless of who won their state .\n\u201c As far as the stealing of the Trump nomination , that \u2019 s a big concern for everybody , \u201d said Diana Orrock , the RNC committeewoman from Nevada and the only one of 112 committeemen and women who openly supports Trump . None of the nation \u2019 s 56 state and territory GOP chairmen , also convention delegates , have endorsed Trump either . They are subjected to a mix of state-based rules as far as their obligation to back Trump on the first vote .\nThe risk of a routing at a contested convention is becoming more acute because of Trump \u2019 s uncertain standing going into Wisconsin \u2019 s primary on Tuesday . Two polls this week showed Cruz 10 points ahead of Trump in the state .\nA loss in Wisconsin would hardly be devastating , but it would surely embolden the anti-Trump forces in other states , making his efforts to win the 60 percent of the yet-to-be-awarded delegates to reach the 1,237 figure needed to clinch the nomination outright that much more difficult , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis .\n\u201c They \u2019 ve got to get their s -- - together in Wisconsin , \u201d said a top Trump ally in the South . \u201c If he doesn \u2019 t have 1,237 , I 'd be very concerned with what happens in Cleveland . \u201d\nDelegates Remaining : 30 Delegates 1,543 559 165 161 23 7 4 1 1 1 1,237 Delegates Needed for Nomination\nBarry Bennett , a Trump adviser involved in convention preparations , panned the doomsday predictions as `` inside Beltway talk \u201d during an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Thursday evening .\nAnd while he acknowledged that Cruz had been more active on the delegate courting front so far , he added , `` Big deal . We 're doing it now . We 're going to talk to all these people . Everybody on the campaign , including Mr. Trump . We 're at it . ''\nHowever , the apparent realization of the magnitude of the delegate flight risk has prompted a sharp and sudden reordering of Trump \u2019 s delegate strategy . The campaign this week tapped convention veteran Paul Manafort to become his campaign \u2019 s point person on corralling delegates .\nSources close to the campaign say Manafort will , in duty rather than title , become the most powerful strategist in the Trump orbit over the next few weeks as he brings aboard a team that includes veterans of the 1976 convention , when he helped Gerald Ford neutralize a challenge from Ronald Reagan . Manafort is running the delegate operation out of a new campaign office opened this week in Washington .\nTrump has also become more vocal about the prospect of losing the nomination at the convention \u2014 arguing that a plurality of delegates should be sufficient to win the nomination and predicting riots in Cleveland if he enters with a lead but loses .\nOne of Trump 's top advisers privately acknowledged worries to a Republican operative that Trump might not make it to 1,237 and aired concerns that his rivals are better-positioned to win a drawn-out convention , according to the operative .\nTrump , according to The New York Times , scolded his aides Thursday during a private meeting with RNC Chairman Reince Priebus for allowing themselves to get outmaneuvered in some of the delegate selection processes .\nCharlie Black , a veteran of Republican conventions who is advising John Kasich \u2019 s campaign , said Trump could find himself in third place on a second ballot in Cleveland .\n\u201c I do know the nature of the delegates . The majority of them , they \u2019 re conservatives but they \u2019 re party regulars \u2014 county chairmen , state regulars , local sheriffs , \u201d he said , suggesting they \u2019 re less inclined to vote for Trump if left to their own devices .\nIn recent days , evidence has emerged that Cruz has proven especially adept at outmaneuvering Trump in the delegate scramble , especially in Louisiana , South Dakota , South Carolina and Wyoming . Reports suggest Cruz is also better organized in Georgia , too .\nPerhaps the most glaring warning sign for Trump is the looming battle for delegates in Massachusetts . Trump scored 49 percent of the vote there , 31 points ahead of second-place Kasich . Cruz finished a distant fourth with 9.6 percent . Yet , it \u2019 s Cruz who seems to have the momentum as the state GOP prepares to hold congressional district conventions and a state party meeting that will elect 39 national delegates .\n\u201c The Trump campaign hasn \u2019 t really gotten out of first gear , but the Cruz campaign is starting to accelerate , \u201d said Brad Wyatt , a longtime party activist who \u2019 s not aligned with either the Cruz or Trump camps . Another top Massachusetts Republican , speaking on condition of anonymity said that at best , Trump will find himself in a dogfight for delegates in the state , despite his dominance in the polls .\nThe cause seems clear to many party insiders : Trump cleaned up among Massachusetts \u2019 huge population of independent voters . But delegate elections are restricted only to the state \u2019 s much smaller population of registered Republicans , many of whom more naturally line up with Cruz . That scenario could play out across the country in states that held open primaries , since Republican Party rules limit delegate selection contests to registered Republicans .\n\u201c In order to get into the [ delegate ] caucuses , you have to be a registered Republican by Feb. 10 , \u201d said Massachusetts state committeeman Reed Hillman , a Kasich supporter . \u201c That \u2019 s going to change the dynamics in terms of the universe of potential participants . The Trump percentage will be significantly lower . The caucuses \u2014 I think they \u2019 re going to have a lot of energetic people showing up for either Kasich delegates or Cruz delegates . \u201d\nTrump allies in Massachusetts huddled Tuesday to begin strategizing for the delegate fight and expressed confidence they \u2019 d help the mogul win his fair share of supporters to the convention . \u201c We \u2019 re doing everything we can to make sure we have Trump delegates who are elected at those caucuses , \u201d said state Rep. Geoff Diehl , Trump \u2019 s point man in the state . \u201c We feel very confident that we \u2019 re going to be able to achieve that . \u201d\nTwo longtime party activists in Massachusetts \u2014 Amy Carnevale and Vincent DeVito \u2014 said they intend to run to become convention delegates for Trump over the next two months .\nBut Cruz \u2019 s operation , helmed by Diehl \u2019 s state House colleague Jim Lyons , has been earning more looks from party insiders who see it as better positioned to capture a disproportionate share of delegates . Kasich \u2019 s operation , too , is mobilizing in Massachusetts to deny Trump .\n\u201c We \u2019 re building out a statewide organization to elect delegates at caucuses in Massachusetts , \u201d said Andrew Boucher , one of two national strategists helming Kasich \u2019 s delegate operation . \u201c Trump might \u2019 ve won the state , but John Kasich came in a strong second . There are a lot of Kasich supporters in the state , there are a lot of Kasich volunteers in the state . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s statement on Tuesday that he might not support the eventual Republican nominee has his opponents claiming he violated the state party \u2019 s loyalty pledge \u2014 a requirement to get on the ballot in South Carolina \u2014 and they are planning to challenge their binding to Trump , as first reported by Time .\nBut a top Trump supporter in the state pointed out that Kasich and Cruz have both cast doubt on whether they would support Trump if he were to become the nominee . The Trump ally dismissed the theory and talk of delegate double agents as \u201c the parlor games that the college Republican tools of the party sit around playing . \u201d\nThe Trump campaign is not planning to go down without a fight . For months , Dan Scavino , a longtime Trump loyalist and the campaign \u2019 s director of social media , has been conducting a charm offensive with likely and definite delegates , holding meetings around the country with RNC members \u2014 including Georgia Committeeman Randy Evans \u2014 and other Republican VIPs .\nOn Thursday , Trump himself traveled to Washington to meet with Priebus , and he emerged professing a renewed commitment to party unity just two days after he discarded the loyalty oath .\nPriebus , speaking to Fox on Thursday night , acknowledged that the delegate selection has gotten \u201c very intense. \u201d He said that Trump and Cruz both still have the chance of reaching the \u201c magic number \u201d of delegates but acknowledged that it \u2019 s a very real possibility that the party is headed to a contested convention .\nIn South Carolina , Lt. Gov . Henry McMaster , who endorsed Trump in January , has been making calls and holding meetings in an effort to find Trump loyalists among the eligible pool of delegates , who were selected at party conventions last year .\nAnd an unaligned senior Republican official in the state said he has seen more potential delegates openly campaigning as Trump delegates at meetings of party activists , though he said that was not necessarily a sign that Trump had more support among potential delegates . \u201c Kasich and Cruz delegates are being a bit more circumspect about their intentions , \u201d he said . \u201c It could be a strategic mistake to openly campaign at this point for a candidate . \u201d\nThough Trump won all 50 delegates in the South Carolina primary , interviews with two dozen prospective delegates and state party insiders suggest many are likely to abandon him on a second ballot . The process in South Carolina is largely dictated by party insiders . And Trump 's decision to sideline his loyalty pledge raised another unnerving specter for his campaign : State Party Chairman Matt Moore suggested on Twitter that the move could disqualify Trump from earning delegates at all , according to state rules .\nThe next test of Trump \u2019 s ability to prevail in Cleveland will begin this weekend in North Dakota , where Republican insiders will elect 25 national delegates at a state convention .
