Page ; ( 2 ) all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation ; and ( 3 ) all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications . In addition , President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice ( including the FBI ) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation , without redaction , of James Comey , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok , Lisa Page , and Bruce Ohr .\nParts of the warrant approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) to wiretap Page to try to determine the extent of his connections with the Russian government were released in July in a heavily redacted format . This order is obviously for the purpose of revealing even more information from both that application and text messages that the administration hopes will show that the investigation of Page and President Donald Trump 's campaign in 2016 were driven by an ideological motivation to try to stop Trump from taking office .\nThis takes us into some pretty uncharted territories here : Just releasing parts of a FISA warrant was new ground ; unredacting even more takes it all even further . It 's still not a full release . The warrant application is 66 pages . What they 're asking to be fully unredacted is all the information that they used to justify the wiretap request itself\u2014the evidence and the conclusion . The second half of the warrant is full of procedural information about minimization ( the process of protecting privileged information from disclosure ) and details of the information being sought and are not included in the declassification order .\nThere is likely to be some groaning about threats to national security here with the potential exposure of sources and methods of snooping on Russia .
