For many folks \u2014 I among them \u2014 this was too much to bear .\nIt was the final public impetus to the release of pent-up rage over the disparate treatment of the races by the government in general and the police specifically , and over public officials who have known of this for generations and looked the other way .\nSince the adoption of the Civil War Amendments to the U.S. Constitution , the governmen \u2014 local , state and federal \u2014 was supposed to have become colorblind .\nBut the death of one innocent Black man by one vicious white cop may have succeeded in achieving what 150 years of legislation and litigation have failed to achieve : turning the tide of public opinion against a culture that looked the other way in the face of governmental racial abuse and disparity .\nBut what began as legitimate , constitutional and laudatory dissent has become , in some places , violence and anarchy . The longer the violence remains unabated , the more pervasive it will become . It is largely unabated because many public officials rely on those committing the violence and their supporters for political backing .\nHence , the utter anarchy in Seattle , where a mayor and a governor declined to restore basic legal protections on the streets . A group of armed thugs , claiming to be liberators , took over a six-block area of that once beautiful city .\nThey destroyed property , prevented travel and commerce and even caused the deaths of innocents . Until death reared its unforgiving head , the police stayed away because the mayor told them to leave the neighborhood alone .\nAt the other end of the societal breakdown are the profoundly unconstitutional power grabs by mayors and governors in the name of public health . They have effectively nullified the Bill of Rights by using the police to infringe upon religion , speech , assembly , travel , self-defense , privacy , commercial intercourse , due process and the sanctity of voluntary contracts .\nThese government leaders have concocted their own rules and had them enforced as if they were law . The hypocritical New Jersey Gov . Phil Murphy violated his own social distancing rules by marching arm-in-arm with protestors , and his own restaurant lockdown orders by visiting a restaurant secretly serving food indoors \u2014 and he famously mocked the Bill of Rights as above his paygrade during an appearance on Fox News .\nIt is exquisitely wrong for mayors and governors to write their own laws .
