    "content": "\u201c Honestly , his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel \u2019 s back . ''\nWith those striking words in an interview published late Sunday , Lisa Page , the ex-FBI lawyer who carried on an extramarital affair with former FBI head of counterintelligence Peter Strzok as the two exchanged anti-Trump text messages , said she was breaking her silence .\nThe 39-year-old Page was referring to Trump 's comments about her and Strzok at an October rally . During the event , Trump performed a passionate , dramatic reading of Strzok and Page 's August 2016 text messages , including Strzok 's conspicuous promise to Page that `` we 'll stop '' Trump from becoming president . At the time , Strzok was overseeing the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign .\nAt one point , Trump screamed out , `` I love you , Lisa ! I love you so much ! Lisa , she 's going to win one-hundred-million-to-nothing . But just in case she does n't win , we 've got an insurance policy ! '' ( Conservative commentators have disputed that Trump was mimicking an orgasm . )\nPage spoke exclusively to The Daily Beast Sunday in a highly sympathetic profile authored by Molly Jong-Fast , who called Strzok `` hawt '' in a tweet last year . In the interview , Page said Trump 's remarks had forced her to confront the president publicly .\n`` I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away , but instead it got worse , \u201d Page said . \u201c It had been so hard not to defend myself , to let people who hate me control the narrative . I decided to take my power back . \u201d\nThe interview comes just days before a widely anticipated new report from DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible FBI misconduct is expected to be released Dec. 9 . Horowitz has reportedly found that an unidentified lower-level FBI lawyer falsified a key document used to obtain a secret surveillance warrant against a former Trump adviser . In a report last year , Horowitz found that the `` damage '' from Strzok and Page 's conduct implicated `` the heart of the FBI 's reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence '' and `` cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation '' into Clinton .\nBut , Page claimed she was coming forward now because of Trump 's `` fake orgasm , '' not to get ahead of the new upcoming IG report .\n\u201c It 's like being punched in the gut , '' Page continued . `` My heart drops to my stomach when I realize he has tweeted about me again . The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world . He \u2019 s demeaning me and my career . It \u2019 s sickening . \u201d\nSeparately , Page tweeted , `` I 'm done being quiet . '' In her interview , Page went on to call the president 's remarks `` intimidating . ''\n\u201c But it 's also very intimidating because he \u2019 s still the president of the United States , '' Page said . `` And when the president accuses you of treason by name , despite the fact that I know there 's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all , let alone treason , he 's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that . To try to further destroy my life . It never goes away or stops , even when he \u2019 s not publicly attacking me . \u201d\nSTRZOK 'S WIFE FOUND EVIDENCE OF HIS AFFAIR WITH LISA PAGE ... AND 'PARANOID ' NEW YORK AGENT FOUND STRZOK WAS APPARENTLY SLOW-WALKING WEINER LAPTOP REVIEW , FILING SAYS\n\u201c I 'm someone who \u2019 s always in my head anyway \u2013 so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning , '' Page complained . `` Like , when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro , I kind of wince , wondering if it \u2019 s because they recognize me , or are they just scanning the train like people do ? It \u2019 s immediately a question of friend or foe ? Or if I \u2019 m walking down the street or shopping and there \u2019 s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat , I \u2019 ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I \u2019 m not looking for conflict . Really , what I wanted most in this world is my life back . \u201d\nPage insisted that when she was assigned to the Clinton email probe , she knew the `` case was going to get picked apart '' and that `` Director [ James ] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment . So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer . And so that \u2019 s what we did . \u201d\nHowever , as the FBI was preparing to interview Clinton at her home at the close of the email probe , Page sent Strzok a text message that suggested she was concerned about the political impact of the investigation .\nWATCH REP.

You think she \u2019 s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi ? \u201d\nHorowitz , the DOJ inspector general , noted in an initial report last year that Strzok and Page 's anti-Trump texts were `` not only indicative of a biased state of mind but , even more seriously , implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate \u2019 s electoral prospects . \u201d\nComey 's firing shortly after Trump took office , Page said , was `` totally within the authority of the president , '' but at the same time was `` unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances .
