Marco Rubio of Florida rolled off a now-familiar list of criticisms of the president 's approach while repeatedly referring to Republican proposals rejected by Democrats .\nFor both sides , the messaging sounded similar to last year 's election campaign in which Obama won the White House for a second term and Democrats strengthened their Senate majority while narrowing the GOP advantage in the House .\nAfter the November vote , Republicans were forced to concede on one of their most steadfast issues by agreeing to higher tax rates on top income earners as part of a January deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of the so-called fiscal cliff .\nThe agreement put off action on mandatory budget cuts , which are set to take effect March 1 . While Obama has called for averting them with deficit-reduction steps that would include more tax revenue and spending cuts , Republicans reject new tax revenue increases .\nSpeaker John Boehner noted Wednesday the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts -- known in Washington jargon as sequestration -- from affecting the military , but Senate Democrats never acted .\nJUST WATCHED Pelosi psychoanalyzes Boehner Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi psychoanalyzes Boehner 03:07\n`` It 's time for the Senate to do its job , '' he told reporters in criticizing the cuts totaling an estimated $ 85 billion in 2013 and roughly $ 1 trillion over the next decade .\nBoehner characterized sequestration as a meat ax approach that would reduce military readiness and cause other problems .\nHe was expected to send a letter on Wednesday to all House members telling them to prepare for the impact of cuts , which will force all legislators , committees and administrative offices to slash their budgets .\n`` We 're prepared to deal with it and I would hope that it would n't happen , '' Boehner said .\nThe Pentagon would be expected to absorb about half the cuts , but other agencies are weighing in with their concerns .\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned in a letter to a key congressional Democrat that the planned cuts would reduce staffing for border patrol and aviation security as well as disaster response .\nOutgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on Wednesday that Congress needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called `` the greatest concern I have for our national security . ''\n`` We need to find solutions , '' Panetta told his final Pentagon news briefing . `` We ca n't just sit here and bitch ; we ca n't just sit here and complain ; we ca n't just sit here and blame others ; we ca n't just sit here and point fingers at each other ; we ca n't just sit here and try to get sound bytes ; we ca n't just sit here and try to make points , political points . ''\nDifferences between parties , politics and ideology will always be part of Congress , the one-time legislator said , adding the legislative branch was fashioned that way to ensure full debate .\n`` But there are also some lines that are there that make that process work , lines that involve mutual respect , lines that involve , you know , courtesy and a degree of respect for each other , despite whatever their decisions are , '' Panetta continued . `` And you kind of see that breaking down in this process . It becomes too personal ; it becomes too mean . ''\nAsked about how the nation is viewed in the world , Panetta said that despite the acknowledged strength of U.S. military power and values , `` there is a nervousness out there about whether , in fact , ultimately we can rise to the challenge of governing ourselves and finding answers to the tough issues that we 're confronting . ''\nIn his State of the Union address , Obama challenged Congress to join him in taking on `` our generation 's task '' to ignite the growth of a `` rising , thriving middle class . ''\nHe emphasized economic growth and job creation , and insisted his proposals would not increase the deficit , though the White House offered no price tag for his initiatives .\nWhen asked Wednesday about the measures Obama touted in Asheville , White House officials said existing funds and savings initiatives in the administration 's upcoming budget proposal would cover the cost .\nObama , in his speech on Tuesday , also made an emotional plea for Congress to hold votes on controversial proposals for tougher gun laws after the Newtown , Connecticut , shootings in December that killed 20 schoolchildren .\nAt the same time , Obama called for legislators to work together for the good of the country , saying Americans `` expect us to put the nation 's interests before party . ''\nIn delivering the Republican response , Rubio repeated longstanding GOP criticism of Obama 's proposals as job-killing , growth-stunting bigger government .\n`` Presidents in both parties -- from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan -- have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle-class prosperity , '' said Rubio , a tea party favorite considered a rising star in the Republican Party . `` But President Obama ? He believes it 's the cause of our problems . ''\nThe night of competing messages showed that despite Obama 's election victory in November , hopes for a more pragmatic political climate appeared unrealistic .\n`` In many ways , what we heard tonight is the same old , same old argument , '' noted CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger .\nJUST WATCHED Rand Paul responds to State of the Union Replay More Videos ...

''\n`` And let 's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors , '' he continued to applause , mainly from Democrats . `` The greatest nation on Earth can not keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next .

''\nIn a jab at congressional Republicans who seek to shrink deficits and government through spending cuts , he said `` deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan . ''\nRubio 's response blamed Obama for weakening U.S. stability and potential by continued deficit spending and failing to confront needed reforms to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare .\n`` The real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending $ 1 trillion more than it takes in every year . That 's why we need a balanced budget amendment , '' he said , accusing Obama of wanting to leave Medicare unchanged so that it goes bankrupt .\nHowever , Obama called for `` modest '' reforms to Medicare in his speech , repeating proposals raised in previous deficit-reduction negotiations but regarded by Republicans as insufficient .\nObama also continued his push for Congress to act on politically volatile issues such as immigration reform . Other measures proposed in the speech included a paycheck fairness act intended to make it easier for women to fight salary discrimination without losing their jobs , raising the minimum wage to $ 9 an hour , developing new alternative energy hubs in the country , and helping people refinance their mortgages at today 's lower interest rates .\nWith former U.S. Rep.

'' They included Pendleton 's parents , Giffords , and the families of the Newtown victims .\nObama repeatedly insisted `` they deserve a vote '' as the audience cheered loudly .\nBut the powerful National Rifle Association and legislators from both parties oppose key provisions of Obama 's plan .\nRubio echoed the NRA position that `` unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to '' reduce gun violence .\nMeanwhile , NRA President David Keene conceded there would be votes on some issues , but he accused Obama of playing up the emotional side of the issue to try to force through gun control laws before they can be properly debated .\nOn foreign policy , Obama announced that this time next year , another 34,000 U.S. troops will have returned home from Afghanistan . The move will reduce by more than half the current force level there of 66,000 troops as Afghan forces prepare to take the lead in combat missions . The plan is for all U.S. combat troops to leave by the end of 2014 .\nOn climate change , Obama promised executive action if Congress failed to address what he called a litany of evidence that the nation and the world face such as more frequent and powerful storms , wildfires and drought .\nOn cybersecurity , Obama signed an order on Tuesday making it easier for private companies controlling critical infrastructure to share information about cyber attacks with the government .
