It 's rather startling that this did n't leak\u2014at least until the Washington Post found out about it Tuesday night\u2014and makes the prospect of a Trump-Kim sitdown far more likely .\nYet it 's also a reminder that Trump apparently did n't consult his previous secretary of state when announcing his own plan to sit down with Kim . And when Rex Tillerson earlier raised the possibility of diplomatic engagement with North Korea , Trump tweeted that he should n't waste his energy on Little Rocket Man .\nThe Haley episode began as a bit of Sunday-show diplomacy . The U.N. ambassador said on `` Face the Nation '' that the administration was ready to act against Moscow in the wake of the U.S. airstrikes against Syria over Bashar Assad \u2019 s alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians .\n`` You will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down , '' Haley said . `` Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday , if he has n't already . And they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons used . ''\nBut that did n't happen . The president was watching and `` grew angry , '' according to The New York Times . And that led to what the paper yesterday called `` a remarkable display of discord that stems not just from competing views of Russia but from larger questions of political ambition , jealousy , resentment and loyalty . ''\nWhen Trump 's new economic adviser , Larry Kudlow , was asked about this , he said Haley `` got ahead of the curve . She 's done a great job . She \u2019 s a very effective ambassador .

Seemed pointed but restrained to me . )\nKudlow , who was obviously trying to smooth things over , told the Times he was `` totally wrong '' to call her confused : `` The policy was changed and she was n't told about it , so she was in a box . '' He also called Haley to apologize .\nIn other words , Haley was following the talking points and no one told her there had been a change on the sanctions , or at least that the decision was n't final .
