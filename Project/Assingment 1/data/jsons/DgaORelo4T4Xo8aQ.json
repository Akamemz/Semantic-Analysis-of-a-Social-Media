He is by far the Senate 's toughest critic of the bill -- crafted by four Democratic and four Republican colleagues -- as it winds its way through the Democratic-controlled Senate .\nHe offered almost 50 amendments to the Judiciary Committee and is trying to derail the bill at nearly every turn . His office sends out daily -- sometimes hourly -- alerts highlighting various perceived flaws in the measure .\nThe proposal `` does not hold up to scrutiny , '' he insisted . `` We 're going to tell the truth about the bill .

Edward Kennedy and John McCain .\nLike President Barack Obama now , Bush made immigration reform a second term priority . Back then -- as now -- reform backers highlighted the glut of undocumented workers doing the toughest jobs on America 's farms and elsewhere .\nSessions is still irritated by a statement Bush made in 2006 that reform is needed because `` there are jobs that just simply are n't getting done because Americans wo n't do them . ''\n`` When President Bush said that there were certain jobs Americans wo n't do , I consider it to be one of the greatest errors in his entire presidency , '' Sessions said . `` Americans are doing tough work every day .

''\nSome immigration reform proponents insist there 's no way to truly lock the border down if there 's a strong enough economic incentive to come to United States .

If changes made at the end of Bush 's term `` had been followed up on , we could have already had the border substantially secure .

''\nAmong the many flaws in the `` Gang of Eight '' bill , according to Sessions , is a diminution of accountability standards along the border .\nHe rails at a decision made by the authors of the bipartisan legislation to ignore a 1996 requirement for the use of biometrics -- such as fingerprints -- for visa holders at all entry and exit points .\nDemocrats and others call the standard -- which was never enacted -- unrealistic and prohibitively expensive . Sessions introduced an amendment withholding citizenship from any undocumented worker until its complete enactment , but the proposal was voted down by the Judiciary Committee in a 12-6 vote .\nThe panel 's 10 Democrats were joined by Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , both members of the `` Gang of Eight . '' Flake and Graham have been working with the panel 's Democratic majority to prevent any major changes to the bill .\n`` Everybody needs to know it -- who 's calling the shots , '' Sessions said at one recent committee meeting .\nSessions also takes aim at language in the bill swapping the existing E-verify system -- an Internet-based program used to check the legal status of potential employees -- with a new one that relies more strongly on photographic matches through passport and driver 's license images , among other things .\nSupporters insist the new version will be more effective , but Sessions says it 's unproven and offers too much discretion to the Department of Homeland Security .\nIt `` could be an improvement '' but `` it 's dangerous the way ( the provision ) is written , '' the senator argued . `` I 'm wondering why they want to go around and create a new one . ''\nBeyond disputes over specific provisions , Sessions makes what he characterizes as a broader moral argument against the proposal .\n`` I will not support citizenship for people who entered the country illegally , '' Sessions said . `` There needs to be some difference between what we do for a person who enters the country legally and those who enter illegally .\n`` And there 's no moral , no legal , no principled reason why this United States government should reward people who broke the law and entered the country illegally with every benefit that you give to somebody who comes lawfully .

''\nAnd what about the argument that by opposing comprehensive immigration reform , Republicans risk permanently alienating America 's rapidly growing Hispanic population ? Sessions returns to his economic theme .\n`` I believe that , politically , at this point in time we should serve and listen to the concerns of the working Americans who are making $ 20,000 to $ 45,000 a year , '' Sessions said .\n`` One of the reasons their wages have n't gone up is because there 's too much labor .
