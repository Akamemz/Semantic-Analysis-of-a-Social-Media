Nobody wants to work anymore , \u201d said Dale Lundquist , a 69-year-old excavation contractor .\nVoters in this northeast Minnesota district have only once sent a Republican to Congress since 1947\u2014for a single term after the 2010 election that produced a wave for the GOP .\nBut Mr. Lundquist , a former Democrat , and some of his friends say they plan to vote for Stewart Mills , the Republican challenger to Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan , one reason the race is down to the wire\u2014and why the GOP is likely to expand its House majority in Tuesday \u2019 s election .\nDemocrats have long been losing their hold on districts such as this one , largely white and rural , where incomes lag the national average and college graduates are relatively sparse . This year , Republicans may take more .\nSeven of the 39 House races rated most competitive by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report are in districts with large numbers of white , working-class voters ; six of those districts are held by Democrats . In addition , one other such Democratic district is seen as likely to flip Republican .\nIn West Virginia , for example , 19-term Rep. Nick Rahall , the seventh most-senior House member , is battling for survival . A district in southern Illinois , represented by Democrats for more than two decades , and northern Maine , where a six-term Democrat is leaving office , are tossups . And Democrats are struggling to hold two seats in Minnesota , including Mr. Nolan \u2019 s sprawling district , which stretches from the Minneapolis exurbs to the U.S.-Canada border .\nNonpartisan political analysts expect Republicans to win somewhere between two and 10 additional House seats . A gain of 12 districts would match the Republican Party \u2019 s post-World War II record of 246 seats in 1947 .\nReclaiming white , working-class voters is a tall order for Democrats , who have won the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections with broad support from minorities , single women and younger voters . Democrats have won national elections with the message that government should help people through such programs as subsidized student loans , food stamps and the Affordable Care Act .\nDemocrats say they can bridge cultural differences and draw white , working-class voters by pushing for a higher minimum wage , for example , and other policies they contend foster economic opportunity . \u201c The white working class hasn \u2019 t had a raise in 20 years , \u201d said Celinda Lake , a Democratic Party strategist . \u201c Economics can unite these constituencies , whereas sometimes the social issues can divide them . \u201d\nBut some voters resent paying for federal programs they say discourage hard work and individual responsibility . In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in June , 53 % of white voters said the government was doing too many things to meet the needs of people , help that should be left to businesses and individuals , compared with 32 % of African-Americans and 44 % of Hispanics .\nFederal programs used to be a safety net , said Dan Anderson , a 52-year-old highway construction worker from Duluth , Minn. , another town in Mr. Nolan \u2019 s district . \u201c Now it \u2019 s a way of life for a lot of people . \u201d\nMr. Anderson supports the long-standing federal government programs of Social Security and Medicare . \u201c There are programs we have to have , \u201d he said , but worried the government was overextending its reach . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to take care of the needy , it \u2019 s just growing into too much . \u201d\nA distinction , said Mr. Lundquist , the excavator , is that \u201c we worked and paid for \u201d Social Security and Medicare . Another Birchwood Cafe regular , masonry contractor Carl Kurtz , 62 , said he worried federal safety-net programs have allowed people to depend too much on the federal government . \u201c All they \u2019 ve done is absolutely destroy the black family. \u201d he said , \u201c and ruined a lot of white families around here , too . \u201d\nIn Aitkin , the seat of Aitkin County , the bowling alley draws a good lunch crowd and local groups host charity \u201c meat raffles \u201d that send winners home with pounds of meat . The county used to regularly tilt Democratic , but now swings between parties . Mr. Obama won the county in 2008 and lost it in 2012 .\nFormer Rep. Barton Gordon of Tennessee , a Democrat , said distrust of government was pervasive in many of the largely-rural districts that have tipped Republican . His own white , working-class district was won by Republican Rep. Diane Black after he retired in 2010 .\n\u201c There became a feeling that the Democratic Party was the party that took money from people that worked and gave it to people that didn \u2019 t work , \u201d Mr. Gordon said . The party \u2019 s tone on social issues also alienated some voters , he said : \u201c Whether it \u2019 s guns or gays or religion , it was almost like the Democratic establishment made fun of those things . \u201d\nAs a group , Republican candidates in the region this year have focused on the pro-business , small-government planks of the GOP platform . Some have avoided the social issues familiar in the campaigns of their peers in more conservative states .\nThe Democrats \u2019 declining support among white , working-class voters began decades ago . In 1993 , for example , Democrats held 36 of the 71 districts that The Wall Street Journal counted as largely white and working-class . Today , Democrats hold just 11 of 70 such districts among the House \u2019 s 435 seats .\nMr. Nolan \u2019 s 8th congressional district is almost 93 % white , with more than half of its residents of German , Norwegian or Swedish heritage . The median household income is $ 49,860 , below the U.S. median of $ 53,000 ; a bit more than 22 % of residents have a bachelor \u2019 s degree or higher , below the national median of 28.5 % , according to the Census Bureau .\nMr. Nolan , a 70-year-old former businessman , served in Congress from 1975 until 1981 . He successfully ran again in 2012 , when Mr. Obama beat former Massachusetts Gov . Mitt Romney in his largely rural district 51.5 % to 46 % .\nAitkin , Minn. , the seat of Aitkin County , used to regularly tilt Democratic but now swings between parties . Jenn Ackerman for The Wall Street Journal\nFor decades , the congressional district was a stronghold of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party\u2014the state \u2019 s Democratic Party\u2014supported by unions for miners and other workers . But as mining became more automated , reducing jobs , the population shrank . The redrawing of district lines after the 1990 and 2000 Census , along with more recent population growth in the district \u2019 s exurbs , have brought in more conservative residents .\nDemocrats control the Minnesota state Legislature , and polls show Democratic Gov . Mark Dayton with a comfortable lead . But Mr. Nolan has a formidable challenger in Mr. Mills , vice president of his family \u2019 s Mills Fleet Farm , a chain of more than 30 stores selling sporting goods and gardening supplies . Mr. Mills , age 42 , supports gun rights and his stores sell guns and ammunition . He also administers a health plan for more than 6,000 of his employees , bringing personal experience to his arguments against the health-care law .\nMr. Mills first drew attention in January 2013 , with an online video challenging Mr. Nolan \u2019 s support for an assault weapons ban and his comment , \u201c I don \u2019 t need an assault weapon to shoot a duck. \u201d The video showed Fleet Farm employees shooting targets at the company \u2019 s firing range to illustrate how shotguns could be more destructive than a semiautomatic rifle , which would be banned under the proposal .\n\u201c In Rick Nolan \u2019 s version of the Second Amendment , we can only have hunting guns , \u201d Mr. Mills said in an interview . \u201c The Republicans are a much better fit for representing the ideals and the priorities for our part of Minnesota . \u201d\nMr. Nolan also backs the Second Amendment , he said , adding \u201c reasonable restrictions have always been a part of our freedoms . \u201d\nMr. Nolan favors a more expansive role for government , including a higher minimum wage , more federal spending on infrastructure and the Affordable Care Act , though with proposed changes . The goal , he said in the campaign , should be a single-payer health system , similar to Medicare .\n\u201c We all do better when we all do better , \u201d Mr. Nolan said .\nGrace Wagner , a 69-year-old farmer , favors Mr. Nolan \u2019 s views and said she has already voted for him by absentee ballot . She credited his support for such programs as fuel assistance and home-weatherization aid .\n\u201c When you \u2019 re on a strict income , it really helps , \u201d she said , while selling produce at a farmer \u2019 s market in Duluth , Minn .\nIn its analysis , The Wall Street Journal included districts that in 1993 had a white population of greater than 85 % , median household income under $ 30,000 and fewer than 17 % of residents with a bachelor \u2019 s degree . To account for inflation and changes in the U.S. population , the Journal analysis counted districts in 2014 with populations greater than 70 % white , median household income under $ 50,000 and less than 25 % of adults with a bachelor \u2019 s degree . For both years , the Journal \u2019 s benchmarks were intended to identify districts that were slightly lower income , had a larger white population and fewer college graduates than the U.S. as a whole .\nWhite , working-class voters play an outsize role in House races largely because of where they live . The U.S. is about evenly split between the two parties , but Democrats are more clustered in cities and Republicans are dispersed more evenly . As a result , Democrats tend to dominate a smaller number of urban districts while Republicans win more districts , though by slimmer margins .\nRepublican-controlled redistricting strengthened the party \u2019 s advantage for House races . After the 2010 census , Republicans controlled both the legislature and governor \u2019 s office in far more states than Democrats did . That enabled the party to redraw congressional boundaries with more Republican-leaning neighborhoods , creating safer GOP districts .\nBut favorable district lines generally don \u2019 t help in presidential elections because most votes are counted statewide . Many Republicans worry the party \u2019 s strength among white voters isn \u2019 t nearly enough to win national elections . In 2012 , for example , Mr. Romney won 59 % of the white vote but lost to Mr. Obama , who carried 80 % support of nonwhite voters .\nFor Republicans , the concern is that the proportion of white voters continues to decline in presidential elections . Some worry the next Democratic presidential nominee could draw a larger share than Mr. Obama did , hurting GOP chances at the White House .\nIn Aitkin , retired state trooper and Vietnam veteran Tom Druar , 65 years old , said he loved President John F. Kennedy asking Americans to serve their country . Too many people , he said , are now only looking for what they can get .\n\u201c I used to be a conservative Democrat , \u201d he said . \u201c There are no more of us . \u201d",
