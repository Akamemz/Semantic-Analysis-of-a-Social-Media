The study , published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine , looks at a federal program that teaches doctors about the risks of prescribing addictive opioids .\nStarting in 2012 , the FDA \u2019 s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program required opioid makers to pay for this training for doctors prescribing long-acting opioids , and to monitor whether it had an impact on overdoses and deaths .
