    "content": "U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson , whose Brexit strategy is in tatters , told lawmakers from his disintegrating Conservative party that he wants to get on with an election to stop his government going around in circles .\nOn Wednesday , members of Parliament are set to push their showdown with the premier over Britain \u2019 s divorce from the European Union to its climax . After seizing control over the parliamentary agenda , Johnson \u2019 s critics will aim to pass a law banning him from taking Britain out of the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31 .\nMPs are debating a new law to block a no-deal split from the EU , an interim vote passed by 329 to 300 , with final votes expected from about 7 p.m .\nGovernment also set to propose a motion for a general election , with a vote late tonight\nGermany and Ireland say a further Brexit delay is possible\nrose 1 % Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid pledged to end austerity in spending plans\nEU Says U.K . Still Has No Talks Proposals ( 6:30 p.m . )\nSenior EU officials , including chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier , briefed the ambassadors of the bloc \u2019 s 27 governments in Brussels today , reaffirming talks are at an impasse and that Johnson \u2019 s envoy David Frost has promised but failed again to deliver concrete proposals , according to three participants in the closed meeting .\nFollowing today \u2019 s meeting between Frost and EU negotiators , the mood is very pessimistic , one of the officials said . EU member states and the Commission reiterated that they are unwavering in their support for Ireland \u2019 s position .\nThe bloc only knows what U.K doesn \u2019 t want , one of the diplomats said . The EU is trying to work out whether the U.K. doesn \u2019 t have a plan , has a plan still in the works , or has a plan but is not ready to present it .\nWhile monitoring developments in London , the EU27 will now focus their energy on no-deal preparations , starting with yet another technical meeting on Thursday , the first diplomat said .\nJohnson Says He Wants to Get On With Election ( 6.15 p.m . )\nBoris Johnson told a private meeting of Conservative MPs that he wants to get on with an election , according to two people present who spoke on condition of anonymity .\nThe prime minister said that the government can \u2019 t keep going in circles without a majority , and that while he doesn \u2019 t want an election , one is inevitable and necessary to break the deadlock currently surrounding Brexit .\nThe Home Office on Wednesday said it will introduce new border controls to make it harder for \u201c serious criminals \u201d to enter the U.K. in the event of a no-deal Brexit . A tougher criminality threshold will be applied to European Economic Area citizens in order to deport and keep out criminals from abroad , the department said .\nIn a measure to allow businesses to recruit and retain staff after Brexit , the Home office also announced that EEA and Swiss citizens and their close family members who arrive in the U.K. between Brexit and the end of 2020 will be able to obtain temporary immigration status lasting three years .\nOther new measures include removing the EU customs channel at entry points , introducing blue passports later this year \u2013 a totemic issue for Brexiteers \u2013 and removing the right to permanent residence for those who arrive after Brexit .\nCaroline Spelman , another Conservative former minister , switched sides and joined the rebels in today \u2019 s vote , according to data from the House of Commons .\nHaving voted against Tuesday night \u2019 s successful bid by MPs to seize control of the Parliamentary timetable , Spelman backed the bill to block a no-deal Brexit .\nSpelman is not expected to be expelled from the party , as rebels were last night , because the vote was not being treated as an issue of confidence in the government , according to a party official speaking on condition of anonymity .\nFirst Stage of Anti No-Deal Brexit Bill Approved ( 5:20 p.m . )\nMembers of Parliament voted by 329 votes to 300 to continue with the bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit .\nThe bill will now be examined in detail in the House of Commons with a series of votes on amendments expected to start at 7 p.m .\nA footnote from Prime Minister \u2019 s Questions earlier in the day : Boris Johnson three times set out his intended date for an early general election as Oct. 15 .\nThat \u2019 s a day later than his officials were briefing last week and addresses concerns that Oct. 14 is the start of a Jewish holiday .\nNicholas Soames , the grandson of Winston Churchill , appeared on the edge of tears as he confirmed he will stand down as an MP after 37 years . He was one of the Tory rebels who was expelled from the Conservative Party by Johnson on Tuesday night .\n\u201c I \u2019 m truly very sad that it should end in this way , \u201d he said . \u201c It is my most fervent hope that this house will rediscover the spirit of compromise , humility and understanding that will enable us finally to push ahead with the vital work in the interests of the whole country that has inevitably had to be so sadly neglected whilst we have devoted so much time to wrestling with Brexit . ''\nHe did allow himself a parting shot at Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg , however , saying that while he had loyally voted for Theresa May \u2019 s deal three times , their disloyalty to the party at that time had helped to inspire his rebellion .\nPhilip Hammond , the former chancellor of the exchequer who was thrown out of the Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Tuesday night , said Parliament voting to block a no-deal Brexit won \u2019 t hinder negotiations \u201c because actually there is no negotiation going on with the EU . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had confirmation from multiple sources across the EU that nothing is happening , \u201d Hammond said . \u201c Nothing we are doing here is going to undermine the prime minister \u2019 s ability to negotiate with the EU . \u201d\nJohnson has claimed said that the only obstacle to getting a deal with the EU is the belief in Brussels that Parliament will continue to block a no-deal divorce . He also claims the legislation will hand power to Jeremy Corbyn , leader of the opposition Labour Party .\nHammond countered that idea , too . \u201c I would sooner boil my head than hand power to the leader of the opposition , \u201d he said .\nLabour \u2019 s members of Parliament held an extra meeting this morning to discuss strategy following its regular gathering last night . Two of the MPs present privately said the party had discussed the timing of a general election , with many voices telling Corbyn to delay until after Britain has left the EU .\nThe party is split , with the leadership keen to go for an election because they think it might put leader Jeremy Corbyn in government , while rank-and-file MPs -- who have doubts about his electoral appeal -- are much more reluctant .\nLabour \u2019 s Treasury spokesman John McDonnell tried to put a gloss on the divisions , telling reporters the debate was about finding the best strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit . Even getting a law passed in Parliament to prevent that scenario -- which MPs are currently debating -- didn \u2019 t guarantee Boris Johnson would obey it , he said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re looking at every way , having secured the legislation , of making sure that he can \u2019 t wriggle out , \u2019 \u2019 McDonnell said .\nIn the House of Commons , MPs have begun to debate a law designed to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31 -- something Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is willing to do if necessary . That \u2019 s why lawmakers voted to take control of Parliament \u2019 s agenda from the government late Tuesday .\nLabour \u2019 s Hilary Benn , one of the bill \u2019 s sponsors , opened the debate , saying legislation is needed because threatening a no-deal Brexit is not a \u201c credible \u201d negotiating strategy .\n\u201c What unites us is a conviction that there is no mandate for no deal , and that the consequences for the economy and for our country would be highly damaging , \u201d Benn said . \u201c No deal doesn \u2019 t end anything , it will simply plunge us into greater uncertainty . No deal will not be the end of Brexit , it will only be the end of the beginning . \u201d\nNo-Deal Efforts Will Limit Worst-Case Brexit Hit : BOE ( 3 p.m . )\nThe U.K. \u2019 s preparations for a no-deal Brexit may help to limit the damage to the economy , though the fallout will still be considerable , according to the Bank of England . The drop in GDP from peak to trough is less than the 8 % seen last November -- but still a dramatic 5.5 % , the central bank said as it updated its assumptions for a worst-case scenario .\nRead more : No-Deal Efforts Will Limit Worst-Case Brexit Hit , BOE Says\nChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid was reprimanded three times by Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for being too political in his spending statement to Parliament .\nJohn McDonnell , Labour \u2019 s Treasury spokesman , accused Javid of using the announcement to win votes in a coming election , which Johnson wants Parliament to approve tonight .\n\u201c People will see this as the grubby electioneering that it is , \u201d McDonnell said . \u201c It \u2019 s straight out of the Lynton Crosby book of opinion poll politics , \u201d he said , referring to Johnson \u2019 s elections adviser .

( see 1:25 p.m . )\n\u201c The question is the speed at which we can get it through the Lords but I don \u2019 t doubt there \u2019 s a majority for it there , \u201d Benn told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview .\nMost of the action today is in the House of Commons , but in the upper House of Lords , where the rebel Brexit bill will go next , another battle will begin this afternoon .\nThe opposition will be trying to seize control of the agenda , just as happened in the Commons yesterday . But unlike yesterday , it first has to get past dozens of amendments that have been proposed in an effort to filibuster the motion so there isn \u2019 t time for it to be passed .\nThe opposition definitely has enough votes , but it doesn \u2019 t -- yet -- have control of the timetable . Expect the sitting to go through the night , at the very least .\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said his government would support another Brexit delay if it helps secure a deal . Speaking to reporters in Dublin , he said if the U.K. does seek an extension , a persuasive case on how that would help get a divorce agreement would need to be made .\nHe called on Johnson \u2019 s administration to bring forward \u201c alternatives that do the same job \u201d as the contentious backstop plan for avoiding goods checks at the Irish border . \u201c We can \u2019 t do a deal unless we have proposals to work with , \u201d he added .\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is keeping abreast of the political developments in London . \u201c The German government is watching the procedures in parliament with interest , \u201d her chief spokesman , Steffen Seibert , said in Berlin .\nSeibert said EU member states remained willing to reach an agreement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2019 s government , \u201c even now on Sept. 4. \u201d Any extension would be for the U.K. government to decide \u2013 and member states would consider it accordingly , he said .\nJohnson faced an impassioned attack from Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi over a 2018 newspaper article the premier wrote . In his article , Johnson compared Muslim women wearing burqas covering their faces and bodies to letterboxes and bank-robbers .\nSikh lawmaker Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi \u2019 s criticism of Johnson draws applause from opposition benches . Source : \u2588\u2588\u2588\nDhesi drew applause from opposition MPs over his stance . Johnson did not reply directly , accusing Labour of anti-semitism . Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson admonished Johnson for his response , saying the prime minister \u201c must be more careful \u2019 \u2019 about what he says .\nAt Johnson \u2019 s first weekly question and answer session in Parliament , the prime minister repeated his line that the U.K. intends to leave the EU on Oct. 31 . He said the only thing that stands in the way is \u201c the surrender bill from the opposition . \u201d\nJohnson called on Corbyn to say whether Labour would vote for an election , suggesting his opponent was afraid of such a contest . \u201c Is he frit ? \u201d Johnson asked , a term used by former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to accuse an opponent of cowardice . Later Johnson called Corbyn \u201c a chlorinated chicken \u201d a joke based on concerns that Brexit will lead to lower food standards .\nCorbyn repeatedly asked Johnson to set out his negotiating position with the EU , which the premier repeatedly dodged . \u201c These negotiations are a sham , all he is doing is running down the clock , \u201d Corbyn said . \u201c I fail to see how I can be accused of undermining negotiations because no negotiations are taking place . \u201d\nThe European Commission \u2019 s published a 12-page note of its preparations for no-deal and one stand-out section is what it says about the Irish border and the \u201c backstop \u201d that Johnson wants removed from Theresa May \u2019 s deal .\nThe commission says the contentious \u201c backstop \u201d -- which would guarantee the border is kept free of infrastructure and controls until suitable alternative arrangements are agreed -- is the \u201c only solution identified that safeguards the Good Friday agreement , ensures compliance with international law obligations and preserves the integrity of the single market . \u201d\nPointedly , it says that in the event of a no-deal Brexit , EU law requires all goods entering Ireland from U.K. to be subject to relevant checks and controls .\nThe Commission and Ireland \u201c continue working together \u201d on steps for immediate aftermath of no deal and \u201c a more stable solution \u201d in the longer term , the document says .\nBoris Johnson \u2019 s cabinet discussed the spending round at their meeting this morning , according to an statement from the Prime Minister \u2019 s office . The official \u201c readout \u201d didn \u2019 t mention any discussions about Tuesday night \u2019 s votes at the meeting .\nThe spending round , due to be announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid on Wednesday afternoon , will focus on domestic priorities , including health , schools and tackling crime , according to the statement .\nThe EU isn \u2019 t moved by last night \u2019 s excitement in the House of Commons , in public at least .\nFor European officials , Boris Johnson remains their point of contact , European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels , distancing herself from any idea that the bloc thinks he \u2019 s no longer in charge .\nNothing has changed from the EU \u2019 s point of view , Andreeva said .\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage , who praised Johnson \u2019 s sacking of Tory rebels as a \u201c an act of real leadership , \u201d welcomed the appointment of Steve Baker as chairman of the Brexiteer European Research Group .\nIn a posting on Twitter , Farage welcomed Baker \u2019 s suggestion of an election pact between the two parties and that he would oppose a Brexit deal \u201c even if the backstop is removed . \u201d\n\u201c A positive step in the right direction to deliver a clean break Brexit , \u201d Farage said on Twitter .\nA YouGov poll published on Tuesday had the Tories on 35 % , Labour on 25 % , Liberal Democrats on 16 % and the Brexit Party on 11 % , showing the potential benefit of a pact for the party .\nFormer cabinet minister Greg Hands said he \u2019 s \u201c uncomfortable \u201d with removing the whip from the 21 Tory MPs , but described Tuesday night \u2019 s bill as a \u201c ludicrous construction \u201d which hands power to Brussels .\nHe said in an interview with Ireland \u2019 s RTE radio that he doesn \u2019 t think an election is a good idea as he doubts it would change the make up of the House of Commons that much .\nLabour Brexit Spokesman Keir Starmer confirmed that Labour will not back Johnson \u2019 s call for a general election when it comes to Parliament on Wednesday evening .\nOpposition parties -- and many Conservatives -- do not trust Johnson and want to ensure the law delaying Brexit until Jan. 31 unless Johnson can get a deal is firmly on the statute books , Starmer said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going walk into a trap . This week it \u2019 s crucial we complete the task in hand , \u201d Starmer said in interview with BBC Radio 4 . \u201c We \u2019 re not shy of a general election but we \u2019 re not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament , abandoning this plan . \u201d\nConservative MPs woke Wednesday morning nursing the political equivalent of a hangover after 21 of their colleagues were expelled for defying Johnson and backing a move to take control of Parliament to block a no-deal Brexit .\nTwo former chancellors of the exchequer , Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond , alongside Winston Churchill \u2019 s grandson Nicholas Soames had the whip withdrawn , meaning they are no longer Conservatives , although they remain as members of Parliament .\nThe move prompted astonishment from moderates . Ruth Davidson , who as leader of the party in Scotland proved a vote-winner , tweeted : \u201c How , in the name of all that is good and holy , is there no longer room in the Conservative Party for Nicholas Soames . \u201d\nHowever , former leader Michael Howard , on the Brexit-supporting wing of the party , said the expulsion of Clarke -- his friend of sixty years -- was inevitable and followed \u201c the logic of events . \u201d\nIrish Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty said it was \u201c comforting \u201d that the House of Commons had taken the first step toward forcing Boris Johnson to delay Brexit by three months in an effort to stop a no-deal split .\n\u201c The only thing we \u2019 re absolutely sure that Westminster does not want is a hard Brexit , \u201d Doherty said in an interview with state broadcaster RTE . \u201c And I think that \u2019 s comforting . \u201d\nThe Irish gamble to stick by the backstop has been underpinned by a consistent belief that Parliament would block a no-deal Brexit , which would accelerate many of the consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU that Ireland has been trying to avoid .\nWounded Johnson \u2019 s Brexit Plan in Tatters as Election Fight Looms\nBrexit Rips Conservative Party Apart as Johnson Expels 21 Rebels\n\u2014 With assistance by Peter Flanagan , Dara Doyle , Patrick Donahue , David Goodman , Ian Wishart , Alex Morales , and Jess Shankleman",

After seizing control over the parliamentary agenda, Johnson\u2019s critics will aim to pass a law banning him from taking Britain out of the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nMPs are debating a new law to block a no-deal split from the EU, an interim vote passed by 329 to 300, with final votes expected from about 7 p.m.\n\nGovernment also set to propose a motion for a general election, with a vote late tonight\n\nGermany and Ireland say a further Brexit delay is possible\n\nThe pound rose 1%\n\nrose 1% Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid pledged to end austerity in spending plans\n\nEU Says U.K. Still Has No Talks Proposals (6:30 p.m.)\n\nSenior EU officials, including chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, briefed the ambassadors of the bloc\u2019s 27 governments in Brussels today, reaffirming talks are at an impasse and that Johnson\u2019s envoy David Frost has promised but failed again to deliver concrete proposals, according to three participants in the closed meeting.\n\nFollowing today\u2019s meeting between Frost and EU negotiators, the mood is very pessimistic, one of the officials said. EU member states and the Commission reiterated that they are unwavering in their support for Ireland\u2019s position.\n\nThe bloc only knows what U.K doesn\u2019t want, one of the diplomats said. The EU is trying to work out whether the U.K. doesn\u2019t have a plan, has a plan still in the works, or has a plan but is not ready to present it.\n\nWhile monitoring developments in London, the EU27 will now focus their energy on no-deal preparations, starting with yet another technical meeting on Thursday, the first diplomat said.\n\nJohnson Says He Wants to Get On With Election (6.15 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson told a private meeting of Conservative MPs that he wants to get on with an election, according to two people present who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe prime minister said that the government can\u2019t keep going in circles without a majority, and that while he doesn\u2019t want an election, one is inevitable and necessary to break the deadlock currently surrounding Brexit.\n\nU.K. Toughens Rules for Foreign Criminals (5:55 p.m.)\n\nThe Home Office on Wednesday said it will introduce new border controls to make it harder for \u201cserious criminals\u201d to enter the U.K. in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A tougher criminality threshold will be applied to European Economic Area citizens in order to deport and keep out criminals from abroad, the department said.\n\nIn a measure to allow businesses to recruit and retain staff after Brexit, the Home office also announced that EEA and Swiss citizens and their close family members who arrive in the U.K. between Brexit and the end of 2020 will be able to obtain temporary immigration status lasting three years.\n\nOther new measures include removing the EU customs channel at entry points, introducing blue passports later this year \u2013 a totemic issue for Brexiteers \u2013 and removing the right to permanent residence for those who arrive after Brexit.\n\nSpelman Joins the Anti No-Brexit Rebels (5:40 pm.)\n\nCaroline Spelman, another Conservative former minister, switched sides and joined the rebels in today\u2019s vote, according to data from the House of Commons.\n\nHaving voted against Tuesday night\u2019s successful bid by MPs to seize control of the Parliamentary timetable, Spelman backed the bill to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSpelman is not expected to be expelled from the party, as rebels were last night, because the vote was not being treated as an issue of confidence in the government, according to a party official speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nFirst Stage of Anti No-Deal Brexit Bill Approved (5:20 p.m.)\n\nMembers of Parliament voted by 329 votes to 300 to continue with the bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe bill will now be examined in detail in the House of Commons with a series of votes on amendments expected to start at 7 p.m.\n\nJohnson Wants General Election for Oct. 15 (4:55 p.m.)\n\nA footnote from Prime Minister\u2019s Questions earlier in the day: Boris Johnson three times set out his intended date for an early general election as Oct. 15.\n\nThat\u2019s a day later than his officials were briefing last week and addresses concerns that Oct. 14 is the start of a Jewish holiday.\n\nChurchill\u2019s Grandson Chides Johnson for Disloyalty (4:25 p.m.)\n\nNicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, appeared on the edge of tears as he confirmed he will stand down as an MP after 37 years. He was one of the Tory rebels who was expelled from the Conservative Party by Johnson on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly very sad that it should end in this way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is my most fervent hope that this house will rediscover the spirit of compromise, humility and understanding that will enable us finally to push ahead with the vital work in the interests of the whole country that has inevitably had to be so sadly neglected whilst we have devoted so much time to wrestling with Brexit.\"\n\nHe did allow himself a parting shot at Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, however, saying that while he had loyally voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, their disloyalty to the party at that time had helped to inspire his rebellion.\n\nHammond: Government Isn\u2019t Negotiating With EU (4:20 p.m.)\n\nPhilip Hammond, the former chancellor of the exchequer who was thrown out of the Conservative Party for voting against Boris Johnson on Tuesday night, said Parliament voting to block a no-deal Brexit won\u2019t hinder negotiations \u201cbecause actually there is no negotiation going on with the EU.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had confirmation from multiple sources across the EU that nothing is happening,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cNothing we are doing here is going to undermine the prime minister\u2019s ability to negotiate with the EU.\u201d\n\nJohnson has claimed said that the only obstacle to getting a deal with the EU is the belief in Brussels that Parliament will continue to block a no-deal divorce. He also claims the legislation will hand power to Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party.\n\nHammond countered that idea, too. \u201cI would sooner boil my head than hand power to the leader of the opposition,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour\u2019s Election Conundrum (3:40 pm)\n\nLabour\u2019s members of Parliament held an extra meeting this morning to discuss strategy following its regular gathering last night. Two of the MPs present privately said the party had discussed the timing of a general election, with many voices telling Corbyn to delay until after Britain has left the EU.\n\nThe party is split, with the leadership keen to go for an election because they think it might put leader Jeremy Corbyn in government, while rank-and-file MPs -- who have doubts about his electoral appeal -- are much more reluctant.\n\nLabour\u2019s Treasury spokesman John McDonnell tried to put a gloss on the divisions, telling reporters the debate was about finding the best strategy for avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Even getting a law passed in Parliament to prevent that scenario -- which MPs are currently debating -- didn\u2019t guarantee Boris Johnson would obey it, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at every way, having secured the legislation, of making sure that he can\u2019t wriggle out,\u2019\u2019 McDonnell said.\n\nMPs Begin Debate on No-Deal Brexit Law (3:40 p.m.)\n\nIn the House of Commons, MPs have begun to debate a law designed to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31 -- something Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is willing to do if necessary. That\u2019s why lawmakers voted to take control of Parliament\u2019s agenda from the government late Tuesday.\n\nLabour\u2019s Hilary Benn, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, opened the debate, saying legislation is needed because threatening a no-deal Brexit is not a \u201ccredible\u201d negotiating strategy.\n\n\u201cWhat unites us is a conviction that there is no mandate for no deal, and that the consequences for the economy and for our country would be highly damaging,\u201d Benn said. \u201cNo deal doesn\u2019t end anything, it will simply plunge us into greater uncertainty. No deal will not be the end of Brexit, it will only be the end of the beginning.\u201d\n\nNo-Deal Efforts Will Limit Worst-Case Brexit Hit: BOE (3 p.m.)\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s preparations for a no-deal Brexit may help to limit the damage to the economy, though the fallout will still be considerable, according to the Bank of England. The drop in GDP from peak to trough is less than the 8% seen last November -- but still a dramatic 5.5%, the central bank said as it updated its assumptions for a worst-case scenario.\n\nRead more: No-Deal Efforts Will Limit Worst-Case Brexit Hit, BOE Says\n\nJavid Told Not to Electioneer in Statement (2:10 p.m.)\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid was reprimanded three times by Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow for being too political in his spending statement to Parliament.\n\nJohn McDonnell, Labour\u2019s Treasury spokesman, accused Javid of using the announcement to win votes in a coming election, which Johnson wants Parliament to approve tonight.\n\n\u201cPeople will see this as the grubby electioneering that it is,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s straight out of the Lynton Crosby book of opinion poll politics,\u201d he said, referring to Johnson\u2019s elections adviser. The Tories \u201chave calculated how little they have to spend\u201d to meet people\u2019s concerns about key issues, he said.\n\nRead More: Javid Pledges End to Austerity as Election Looms\n\nBenn Confident Bill Will Pass Lords (2:05 p.m.)\n\nHilary Benn, one of the sponsors of the bill to extend Brexit negotiations, said he\u2019s confident it will pass its remaining stages in the House of Commons later Wednesday and survive any filibuster attempts in the House of Lords. (see 1:25 p.m.)\n\n\u201cThe question is the speed at which we can get it through the Lords but I don\u2019t doubt there\u2019s a majority for it there,\u201d Benn told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\nHouse of Lords Prepares for Filibuster Fight (1.25 p.m.)\n\nMost of the action today is in the House of Commons, but in the upper House of Lords, where the rebel Brexit bill will go next, another battle will begin this afternoon.\n\nThe opposition will be trying to seize control of the agenda, just as happened in the Commons yesterday. But unlike yesterday, it first has to get past dozens of amendments that have been proposed in an effort to filibuster the motion so there isn\u2019t time for it to be passed.\n\nThe opposition definitely has enough votes, but it doesn\u2019t -- yet -- have control of the timetable. Expect the sitting to go through the night, at the very least.\n\nIrish Open to Deadline Extension (1:16 p.m.)\n\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said his government would support another Brexit delay if it helps secure a deal. Speaking to reporters in Dublin, he said if the U.K. does seek an extension, a persuasive case on how that would help get a divorce agreement would need to be made.\n\nHe called on Johnson\u2019s administration to bring forward \u201calternatives that do the same job\u201d as the contentious backstop plan for avoiding goods checks at the Irish border. \u201cWe can\u2019t do a deal unless we have proposals to work with,\u201d he added.\n\nMerkel\u2019s Office Says Brexit Delay Possible (1:10 p.m.)\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is keeping abreast of the political developments in London. \u201cThe German government is watching the procedures in parliament with interest,\u201d her chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in Berlin.\n\nSeibert said EU member states remained willing to reach an agreement with Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government, \u201ceven now on Sept. 4.\u201d Any extension would be for the U.K. government to decide \u2013 and member states would consider it accordingly, he said.\n\nJohnson faced an impassioned attack from Sikh Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi over a 2018 newspaper article the premier wrote. In his article, Johnson compared Muslim women wearing burqas covering their faces and bodies to letterboxes and bank-robbers.\n\nSikh lawmaker Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi\u2019s criticism of Johnson draws applause from opposition benches. Source: Bloomberg\n\nDhesi drew applause from opposition MPs over his stance. Johnson did not reply directly, accusing Labour of anti-semitism. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson admonished Johnson for his response, saying the prime minister \u201cmust be more careful\u2019\u2019 about what he says.\n\nJohnson and Corbyn Clash Over Brexit, Election (12:20 p.m.)\n\nAt Johnson\u2019s first weekly question and answer session in Parliament, the prime minister repeated his line that the U.K. intends to leave the EU on Oct. 31. He said the only thing that stands in the way is \u201cthe surrender bill from the opposition.\u201d\n\nBoris Johnson on Sept. 4.\n\nJohnson called on Corbyn to say whether Labour would vote for an election, suggesting his opponent was afraid of such a contest. \u201cIs he frit?\u201d Johnson asked, a term used by former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to accuse an opponent of cowardice. Later Johnson called Corbyn \u201ca chlorinated chicken\u201d a joke based on concerns that Brexit will lead to lower food standards.\n\nCorbyn repeatedly asked Johnson to set out his negotiating position with the EU, which the premier repeatedly dodged. \u201cThese negotiations are a sham, all he is doing is running down the clock,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cI fail to see how I can be accused of undermining negotiations because no negotiations are taking place.\u201d\n\nEU Sees Irish Backstop as Only Solution (11:45 a.m.)\n\nThe European Commission\u2019s published a 12-page note of its preparations for no-deal and one stand-out section is what it says about the Irish border and the \u201cbackstop\u201d that Johnson wants removed from Theresa May\u2019s deal.\n\nThe commission says the contentious \u201cbackstop\u201d -- which would guarantee the border is kept free of infrastructure and controls until suitable alternative arrangements are agreed -- is the \u201conly solution identified that safeguards the Good Friday agreement, ensures compliance with international law obligations and preserves the integrity of the single market.\u201d\n\nPointedly, it says that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, EU law requires all goods entering Ireland from U.K. to be subject to relevant checks and controls.\n\nThe Commission and Ireland \u201ccontinue working together\u201d on steps for immediate aftermath of no deal and \u201ca more stable solution\u201d in the longer term, the document says.\n\nCabinet Focused on Spending Announcement (11:35 a.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s cabinet discussed the spending round at their meeting this morning, according to an statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s office. The official \u201creadout\u201d didn\u2019t mention any discussions about Tuesday night\u2019s votes at the meeting.\n\nThe spending round, due to be announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid on Wednesday afternoon, will focus on domestic priorities, including health, schools and tackling crime, according to the statement.\n\nEU Unmoved by Johnson\u2019s Commons Defeat (11:20 a.m.)\n\nThe EU isn\u2019t moved by last night\u2019s excitement in the House of Commons, in public at least.\n\nFor European officials, Boris Johnson remains their point of contact, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels, distancing herself from any idea that the bloc thinks he\u2019s no longer in charge.\n\nNothing has changed from the EU\u2019s point of view, Andreeva said.\n\nFarage Backs Brexit Pact With Tories (10:45 a.m.)\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who praised Johnson\u2019s sacking of Tory rebels as a \u201can act of real leadership,\u201d welcomed the appointment of Steve Baker as chairman of the Brexiteer European Research Group.\n\nNigel Farage\n\nIn a posting on Twitter, Farage welcomed Baker\u2019s suggestion of an election pact between the two parties and that he would oppose a Brexit deal \u201ceven if the backstop is removed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA positive step in the right direction to deliver a clean break Brexit,\u201d Farage said on Twitter.\n\nA YouGov poll published on Tuesday had the Tories on 35%, Labour on 25%, Liberal Democrats on 16% and the Brexit Party on 11%, showing the potential benefit of a pact for the party.\n\nHands \u2018Uncomfortable\u2019 With Tory Purge (10:10 a.m.)\n\nFormer cabinet minister Greg Hands said he\u2019s \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with removing the whip from the 21 Tory MPs, but described Tuesday night\u2019s bill as a \u201cludicrous construction\u201d which hands power to Brussels.\n\nHe said in an interview with Ireland\u2019s RTE radio that he doesn\u2019t think an election is a good idea as he doubts it would change the make up of the House of Commons that much.\n\nLabour Won\u2019t Be \u2018Trapped,\u2019 Starmer Says (8:20 a.m.)\n\nLabour Brexit Spokesman Keir Starmer confirmed that Labour will not back Johnson\u2019s call for a general election when it comes to Parliament on Wednesday evening.\n\nOpposition parties -- and many Conservatives -- do not trust Johnson and want to ensure the law delaying Brexit until Jan. 31 unless Johnson can get a deal is firmly on the statute books, Starmer said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going walk into a trap. This week it\u2019s crucial we complete the task in hand,\u201d Starmer said in interview with BBC Radio 4. \u201cWe\u2019re not shy of a general election but we\u2019re not going to be trapped into abandoning control of Parliament, abandoning this plan.\u201d\n\nTories Reel after Rebels Expelled (Earlier)\n\nConservative MPs woke Wednesday morning nursing the political equivalent of a hangover after 21 of their colleagues were expelled for defying Johnson and backing a move to take control of Parliament to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nTwo former chancellors of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke and Philip Hammond, alongside Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson Nicholas Soames had the whip withdrawn, meaning they are no longer Conservatives, although they remain as members of Parliament.\n\nThe move prompted astonishment from moderates. Ruth Davidson, who as leader of the party in Scotland proved a vote-winner, tweeted: \u201cHow, in the name of all that is good and holy, is there no longer room in the Conservative Party for Nicholas Soames.\u201d\n\nHowever, former leader Michael Howard, on the Brexit-supporting wing of the party, said the expulsion of Clarke -- his friend of sixty years -- was inevitable and followed \u201cthe logic of events.\u201d\n\nIrish Take Comfort From Westminster (Earlier)\n\nIrish Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty said it was \u201ccomforting\u201d that the House of Commons had taken the first step toward forcing Boris Johnson to delay Brexit by three months in an effort to stop a no-deal split.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we\u2019re absolutely sure that Westminster does not want is a hard Brexit,\u201d Doherty said in an interview with state broadcaster RTE. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s comforting.\u201d\n\nThe Irish gamble to stick by the backstop has been underpinned by a consistent belief that Parliament would block a no-deal Brexit, which would accelerate many of the consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU that Ireland has been trying to avoid.\n\nEarlier:\n\n\n\nWounded Johnson\u2019s Brexit Plan in Tatters as Election Fight Looms\n\nBrexit Rips Conservative Party Apart as Johnson Expels 21 Rebels\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Peter Flanagan, Dara Doyle, Patrick Donahue, David Goodman, Ian Wishart, Alex Morales, and Jess Shankleman",
