But she wasn \u2019 t going to miss Booker \u2019 s first major televised debate of the election cycle , one that in other circumstances\u2014when she wasn \u2019 t in the throes of diaper changes and feedings\u2014she would have watched from campaign headquarters .

Almost a year after a record number of women won elected offices throughout the country ( buoyed by female voters ) , there seems to be an understanding among presidential hopefuls that if you want to win , you \u2019 d better have women on your side\u2014and on your staff .
