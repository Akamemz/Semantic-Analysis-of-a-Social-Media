Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , and Sen. Ed Markey , D-Mass. , think they have a start to a solution . Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a `` Green New Deal '' \u2014 what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and , they hope , eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions .\nThat 's a really big \u2014 potentially impossibly big \u2014 undertaking .\n`` Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us , '' Ocasio-Cortez told NPR 's Steve Inskeep in an interview that aired Thursday on Morning Edition .\nShe added : `` It could be part of a larger solution , but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail . And so that 's really what we 're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal . ''\nIn very broad strokes , the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy , from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture . In the process , it aims to create jobs and boost the economy .\nIn that vein , the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor , disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the Green New Deal calls for .\nImportantly , it 's a nonbinding resolution , meaning that even if it were to pass ( more on the challenges to that below ) , it would n't itself create any new programs . Instead , it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years .\nLawmakers pass nonbinding resolutions for things as simple as congratulating Super Bowl winners , as well as to send political messages \u2014 for example , telling the president they disapprove of his trade policies , as the Senate did in summer 2018 .\nThe bill calls for a `` 10-year national mobilizations '' toward accomplishing a series of goals that the resolution lays out .\nAmong the most prominent , the deal calls for `` meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean , renewable , and zero-emission energy sources . '' The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely , Ocasio-Cortez 's office told NPR , as well as to transition away from nuclear energy .\nIn addition , the framework , as described in the legislation as well as a blog post \u2014 containing an updated version of `` FAQs '' provided to NPR by Ocasio-Cortez 's office \u2014 calls for a variety of other lofty goals :\n`` upgrading all existing buildings '' in the country for energy efficiency ;\nworking with farmers `` to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions ... as much as is technologically feasible '' ( while supporting family farms and promoting `` universal access to healthy food '' ) ;\n`` Overhauling transportation systems '' to reduce emissions \u2014 including expanding electric car manufacturing , building `` charging stations everywhere , '' and expanding high-speed rail to `` a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary '' ;\nA guaranteed job `` with a family-sustaining wage , adequate family and medical leave , paid vacations and retirement security '' for every American ;\nWhich is to say : the Green New Deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that , taken together , would touch nearly every American and overhaul the economy .\nMany in the climate science community , as well as Green New Deal proponents , agree that saving the world from disastrous effects of climate change requires aggressive action .\nAnd some of the Green New Deal 's goals are indeed aggressive . For example , Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that `` in 10 years , we 're trying to go carbon-neutral . ''\nAccording to Jesse Jenkins , a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard 's Kennedy School , that may be an unreachable goal .\n`` Where we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050 , which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically , '' he said . `` 2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting . ''\nSimilarly , removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation .\nLikewise , some of the more progressive economic policies \u2014 universal health care and a job guarantee , for example \u2014 while popular among some Democrats , would also be very difficult to implement and transition into .\nOn top of all that , implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars .\nAltogether , the Green New Deal is a loose framework . It does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies .\nRather , the idea is that Ocasio-Cortez and Markey will `` begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution . ''\nAnd again , all of this is hypothetical \u2014 it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed .\nSo did the idea of a Green New Deal start with Ocasio-Cortez ?\nPolitics Congressional Democrats Say Climate Change Is A Priority As They Control The House Congressional Democrats Say Climate Change Is A Priority As They Control The House Listen \u00b7 3:20 3:20\nWhile the Green New Deal has in the last year or so grown central to progressive Democrats ' policy conversations , the idea of a Green New Deal itself is well over a decade old . Environmentalists were talking about it as far back as 2003 , when the term popped up in a San Francisco Chronicle article about an environmentalist conference .\nIt gained traction with a 2007 New York Times column from Thomas Friedman , where he used the phrase to describe the scope of energy investments he thought would be necessary to slow climate change on a large scale .\nThe phrase was also used around President Barack Obama 's 2009 stimulus , which had around $ 90 billion worth of environmental initiatives .\nWhile the idea gained some currency in Europe and also in the Green Party , it was n't until after the 2016 election that it really gained broad popularity on the left in the U.S. ( Vox 's Dave Roberts has a more thorough history here ) .\nThis latest iteration is different both in the political energy that it has amassed and the grand scope it is taking . While it was a product of the progressive activist community , Ocasio-Cortez has been perhaps the most visible proponent of the plan and has helped it gain nationwide attention .\nYes , there 's some energy for it on the left \u2014 some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill . However , there are indications House leadership is n't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together .\nAfter the deal 's Thursday release , she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider .\n`` It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive , '' Pelosi told Politico . `` The green dream or whatever they call it , nobody knows what it is , but they 're for it right ? ''\nIn addition , it 's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate House Democrats , many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal .\nAmong Republicans \u2014 even those worried about climate change \u2014 the package , with its liberal economic ideas , will also likely be a nonstarter .\n`` Someone 's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we 're gon na be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels , '' said Rep. Francis Rooney , R-Fla. , co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus , speaking to NPR before the Green New Deal 's text was released .\nFor his part , Rooney is in favor of a carbon tax , a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in November . Information from Ocasio-Cortez 's office says that the Green New Deal could include a carbon tax , but that it would be `` a tiny part '' of the total package of policies .\nMeanwhile , there 's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate .\nIf it 's not going to pass and it 's not even binding , why is it worth even talking about ?\nIt 's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among Democrats .\nAlready , presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a Green New Deal , meaning it 's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election .\nTo more liberal Democrats , the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing .\n`` I think it 's like a really weird instinct that the Democratic Party develops to not be exciting intentionally , '' said Sean McElwee , co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress . `` Most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you .
