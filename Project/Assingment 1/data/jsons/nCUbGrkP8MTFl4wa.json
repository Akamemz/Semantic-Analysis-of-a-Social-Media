    "content": "A year ago yesterday , my youngest son lay on a bed in the emergency department of Texas Children \u2019 s Hospital . He suffered with an unexplained high fever and a wave of hives . The staff was anxious . There were no beds in the Bone Marrow Transplant department . A bed was coming open in the cancer ward . Here this bald boy was , severely immune compromised and surrounded by kids coming to the hospital with the flu . This was not good .\nSpencer had been home a month . His bone marrow transplant occurred in September . In late October , they let him go home , but it was precarious . In the middle of flu season , with a nascent immune system , bags of germs , aka humans , were threats . Though home , he would have to be quarantined with no visitors , no school , no social life , but at least it was home . The upsides were many : No IV \u2019 s . No pestering four times a night for vitals and meds . Sleep and peace .\nWe were warned that children often end up back in the hospital . We knew it was possible , but the reality of it was something altogether . Back goes in the IV . Back to being the patient .\nFinally , a bed opened up . After a sleepless night ( for us parents ) , he was transferred to the Cancer Ward \u2014 a surprisingly rambunctious and lively place with bright colors and because it was Thanksgiving , lots of visitors and even more activity . One young child impishly poked his head into Spencer \u2019 s room to inspect the new kid and ran off .\nA floor above , things are not so exciting . The Bone Marrow Transplant Center , or as Spencer liked to call it , The Morgue , was still . There were fifteen beds and because the children are so sick , it \u2019 s kept dark . There \u2019 s no need to tell anyone to be quiet\u2026 it just is . The main goal on this floor is to not die .\nBecause each patient is so isolated in his own room , however , it becomes his own little world . The patient decorates his space the way he wants . He can be there at minimum a month , but in some cases years . It is , for all practical purposes , a hermetically sealed , forced air containing home . A very tiny home . A world in isolation .\nGoing to the cancer ward was a shock . Spencer had been diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia . It is like Leukemia , but in some ways worse . It \u2019 s worse because no one knows what it is , so the social support is nil . It \u2019 s worse because it \u2019 s so rare that those who get it feel cursed . It \u2019 s worse because the only known \u201c cure \u201d is a bone marrow transplant . The best chance for surviving Aplastic Anemia is a full sibling match . Only 23 % of people have a match . Spencer , thankfully , had his sister . So he endured chemotherapy to wipe out what was left of his immune system ( euphemistically called \u201c conditioning \u201d ) and got the transplant . For all this and the hospital time , though , because Spencer was in isolation , and because we forced as much normalcy into the hospital room as possible , there was little self-awareness . Because he didn \u2019 t see others , he didn \u2019 t see himself for how sick he was .\nAt the cancer ward , though , there was no escaping the sick children . Bald babies and kids and teenagers were everywhere . They dragged their IV poles . They grinned and goofed , but they were sick . Their faces swollen from medication . Their bodies slumped and tired . Their eyes war weary and bleak . Spencer was shocked . Horrified . For the first time , he saw that he was gravely ill . It became real .\n\u201c I want to go home . I \u2019 d rather die than be here , \u201d he said , which scared me . There was no consoling him . He was like Adam and Eve in the garden , he saw and knew , and he couldn \u2019 t un-know .\nIn the common room , I met a Hispanic man , a pastor with six children . His eldest daughter , aged 17 , was dying . There were no more treatments for her . As her last act of selflessness , she \u2019 d signed the papers that day , her dad told me , to try an experimental treatment . That way , he said , she felt like her life meant something . She would die helping other people with this disease . He told me this as we waited in line for turkey and stuffing that some generous soul had donated for Thanksgiving . My eyes welled up at the grief of it all . I was in awe of his stoicism and grace . When I got safely back in the hallway , I cried , then pulled myself together to be brave for my son who was being brave for me .\nSpencer \u2019 s multiple tests came back . He was infected with C. Difficile and E. Coli . If you \u2019 re at all knowledgable of things medical , you know this is not good . More antibiotics . The fever broke . The hives abated . Two days later , he was allowed to go home .\nBut we missed Thanksgiving . We were at the hospital with the doctors , nurses , parents , children , and extended families struggling to live and give that life some normalcy .\nRight this minute , one of my dearest childhood friends is dying .
