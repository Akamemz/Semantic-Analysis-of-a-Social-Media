    "content": "All the way back on Tuesday , presidential candidate and , shall we say , polarizing figure Donald Trump promised to unite the Republican Party as he accepted his status as de facto G.O.P . nominee in light of Ted Cruz \u2019 s withdrawal from the race . \u201c We want to bring unity to the Republican party , \u201c he said . \u201c We have to bring unity. \u201d That was four days ago .\nOn Friday , major party figures spoke out against their reluctant nominee , inciting infighting that earned the comparison to a full-on \u201c revolt \u201d by Politico . Jeb ! Bush and Lindsey Graham both echoed the sentiments of House Speaker Paul Ryan , who stated that he was unprepared to allow Trump to be the standard-bearer for the party he holds so dear . As is typical of the famously cool-headed candidate , Trump accepted these remarks diplomatically and indicated that he \u2019 d be willing to work toward a compromise with the established leadership .\nAnd if you believed that , consider me deeply envious of your enduring faith in American politics . In actuality , Trump did not take too kindly to Graham and Bush \u2019 s comments , and struck back with the vitriol that \u2019 s made him such an inspiration to his many diehard fans . Yesterday , Trump released the following statement :\n\u201c I fully understand why Lindsey Graham can not support me . If I got beaten as badly as I beat him , and all the other candidates he endorsed , I would not be able to give my support either . Every time I see Lindsey Graham spew hate during interviews I ask why the media never questions how I single handily [ sic ] destroyed his hapless run for President . As a candidate who did not receive 1 % in his own state -- compared to my victory at nearly 40 % with many others in the race\u2014he has zero credibility . He was a poor representative and an embarrassment to the great people of South Carolina . Judging by the incompetent way he ran his campaign , it is easy to see why his military strategies have failed so badly\u2014we ca n't even beat ISIS ! \u201d\nTrump then expanded on the gem reproduced above during a speech at a rally in Omaha , Nebraska last night . He talked about Jeb Bush , announcing , \u201c I won \u2019 t talk about Jeb Bush. \u201d He continued , saying , \u201c I will not say he \u2019 s low energy. \u201d The next thing he said was \u201c I will not say it. \u201d Trump \u2019 s avant-garde work of conceptual performance art then turned to Graham , using the words \u201c nasty \u201d and \u201c disgrace \u201d to describe the South Carolina Senator . Trump would then turn on Ryan in a series of tweets :\nIt \u2019 s at times like this , when pettiness and hollow theatrical gestures threaten to take the place of respect and sober discourse , that we must think back as a nation to VH1 \u2019 s erstwhile reality series Flavor of Love , and the shining example of civility and dignity that it set . This election cycle has been nothing if not an alternately entertaining and terrifying reality program , and the candidates of the G.O.P . just surpassed New York levels . ( Spat-upon contestant Tiffany Pollard , not the state . ) The time has long since come for the G.O.P . candidates to take a cue from the likes of Buckwild and Punkin and display some compassion towards their fellow human beings . Just as the women of Flavor of Love were able to put aside their differences for the sake of Flavor Flav , the Republicans must reach an understanding for an ever greater good : America , the Flavor Flav of countries .",
