    "content": "$ 19.1 Billion Disaster Aid Bill Stalled After Republican Blocks House Vote\nTexas House Republican Rep. Chip Roy blocked an attempt to pass the $ 19.1 billion disaster aid bill by unanimous consent , likely stalling passage of the legislation until Congress returns in June .\nThe Senate approved the measure Thursday 85-8 and House Democrats had hoped to rush the legislation through in a special session on Friday , skipping the regular voting process because lawmakers had already left town to begin a weeklong Memorial Day recess . The procedural vote required the consent of every House member , and Roy did not approve .\nThe Texas Republican objected to the bill because it `` spends $ 19 billion of taxpayer money without members of Congress being present in our nation 's Capitol to vote on it . '' He also said the package should include money for the Department of Homeland Security to address immigration issues at the southwest border .\nDemocrats expect to have enough votes to pass the legislation when Congress returns on June 3 , but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , called the intervention a `` last-minute sabotage '' of the bipartisan bill .\n`` Countless American families hit by devastating natural disasters across the country will now be denied the relief they urgently need , '' Pelosi said in a statement . `` Every House Republican needs to answer to the American people why they are standing in the way of urgently needed disaster relief for families struggling to heal and recover .
