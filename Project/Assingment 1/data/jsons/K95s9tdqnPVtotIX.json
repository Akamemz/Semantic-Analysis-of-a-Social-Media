But there \u2019 s been little research that quantifies just how unwilling people are to take a potentially unpopular stance on outlets like Facebook and Twitter .\nPew refers to the this tendency to keep opinions to yourself , when you believe they \u2019 re not widely shared , as the \u201c spiral of silence \u201d \u2013 a term coined in the mid-70 \u2019 s by a researcher studying the nature of public opinion .\n\u201c Some social media creators and supporters have hoped that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter might produce different enough discussion venues that those with minority views might feel freer to express their opinions , thus broadening public discourse and adding new perspectives to everyday discussion of political issues , \u201d explains Pew .\nBut as it turns out that optimistic desire is not quite the reality . If anything , social media is encouraging users to keep opinions to themselves .\nIn its study , Pew focused on the controversial topic involving Edward Snowden \u2019 s revelations of widespread government surveillance , because that topic saw a variety of opinions across the U.S. as to whether his actions were justified , and whether the government \u2019 s policies themselves were good or bad .\nOnly 42 % of users said they were willing to discuss the surveillance program on social media , while a much larger 86 % were willing to have an in-person discussion about it .
