It \u2019 s important , now more than ever , to be clear , to call things by their proper name ; to do otherwise is to risk confusion where none exists . What happened in Charleston was terrorism . Period . And terrorism , whatever else it is , is not senseless ; it \u2019 s precisely the opposite .\nTerror is a tactic , not a cause . This is a crucially important distinction . Terrorists are calculating : they do what they do in order to inspire fear . If Dylann Roof had decided , on a whim , to gun down the first people he encountered \u2013 that would be senseless . But Dylann Roof was no nihilist . He believed in something . He was a racist . And he was propelled by specific ideas \u2013 about history , about black people , about white supremacy , and about various other cultural mythologies . \u201c You rape our women , and you \u2019 re taking over our country , and you have to go , \u201d he remarked just before filling that church and those bodies with holes . These are not the words of a mentally ill person committing a senseless act ; they are the cold , clear thoughts of a man on a mission , a man who knows exactly what he \u2019 s doing and why he \u2019 s doing it .
