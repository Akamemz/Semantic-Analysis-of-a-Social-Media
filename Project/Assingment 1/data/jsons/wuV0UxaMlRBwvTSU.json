Then , the court heard arguments in a free-speech case that will determine whether people who encourage illegal immigrants to remain in the country can be prosecuted .\nIn 2010 , 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez and his friends were playing chicken at the U.S. Mexican border , running up and touching the border fence , and then running away and hiding . Video of the scene shows Sergio peeking out from behind a railroad trestle on the Mexico side , as Agent Jesus Mesa Jr. points a gun , fires and kills the boy .\nWhen the U.S. government declined to prosecute the agent or turn him over to Mexican authorities to face murder charges there , the boy 's parents sued the agent for damages , contending that he violated the U.S. Constitution by depriving Hernandez of his life .\nThe suit was brought under a 1971 Supreme Court ruling that allowed such damage claims against officers who act in bad faith .\nThe panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals found that no reasonable officer would have done what Mesa did under the circumstances , but the full appeals court said that it did n't matter whether Mesa had acted unreasonably , his parents could n't sue because Hernandez was standing on the Mexican side of the border when he was shot .\nOn Tuesday , the Supreme Court threw out the suit entirely and went much further , cutting the heart out of much of the court 's 1971 decision .\nThe vote was 5 to 4 , with the court 's conservative justices refusing to allow damage suits for cross-border shootings and the court 's liberal justices castigating the court 's majority for giving a free pass to the `` rogue actions '' of law enforcement officers .\nWriting for the conservative court majority , Justice Samuel Alito said that in essence , the court has come to realize the folly of its earlier decision and has thus sought to limit its effect .\n`` A federal court 's authority to recognize a damages remedy must rest at bottom on a statute enacted by Congress , '' he wrote , `` and no statute expressly creates [ such ] a remedy .

'' The Mexican government , in a brief filed with the Supreme Court , cited U.S. Customs and Border Protection 's own statistics showing that its officers reported use of deadly force involving firearms over 200 times through October 2018 , with nearly all of the deadly shootings near the U.S.-Mexico border , and `` many killings that involved shots fired across the border .

If it 's a charity that `` provides food to someone who 's in the country unlawfully ... is it covered under the statute ? ''\nFeigin acknowledged that it was possible conduct of that sort `` might violate the statute '' but added that there was no instance of it actually being used in that way .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor followed up : `` It has been used '' to create `` a watchlist at the border '' for `` charitable organizations , people who were giving legal advice at the border ... because they potentially violated this encouragement provision . '' And , noted Sotomayor , there was a prosecution in the case of a woman who advised her housekeeper that `` if you return to your home country , you may not get back . ''\nJustice Gorsuch noted that being in the country illegally is not itself a crime , so why is encouraging someone to stay a crime ?\nArguing on behalf of Sineneng-Smith , the defendant in the case , lawyer Mark Fleming faced a grilling from Alito who wanted to know whether there is any kind of encouraging speech that could be criminalized .\nFor instance , what if a bullied and depressed teenager calls up a friend to say he is going to kill himself , and the friend says , `` I 'm tired of hearing this from you ... you 're a coward , why do n't you just do it ... pull the trigger '' ?\nAsked Alito , `` Is that speech protected by the First Amendment ? ''\nNo , replied Fleming , because that is inciting imminent harm , which the Supreme Court has said is not protected .\nAddressing the government 's argument that the statute is not really used to prosecute most speech , Fleming told the justices that while the statute has historically not been used much , the Trump administration has `` recently made it a focus of enforcement . ''\nBuilding on Sotomayor 's point about government watchlists of charitable organizations and lawyers working at the border , Fleming noted that should the court uphold the law , it could soon be used against `` U.S. citizens for their prayer , for their speech , and for their legal advice .
