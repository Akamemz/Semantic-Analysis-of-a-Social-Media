    "content": "If you think internet companies are n't paying any taxes for online sales and that 's killing bricks-and-mortar retailers and states ' budgets , you , my friend , have been duped . Nothing could be further from the truth . The internet is n't a tax-free zone , nor is the lack of revenue the issue with state budgets . There is , however , a battle about whether state and local governments should be allowed to collect taxes from out-of-state companies .\nA 1992 Supreme Court decision , Quill Corp. v. North Dakota , reaffirmed a previous decision that a business must have a significant presence in a state before that state can require it to collect sales taxes . That means a mother selling handcrafted goods on Etsy does n't have to collect sales taxes from her consumers unless they are physically located in her state . However , Amazon collects sales taxes from customers in all 45 states that have a statewide sales tax because of its vast distribution network .\nMost state lawmakers want to see Quill overturned , allowing them to force out-of-state companies to collect sales taxes on their behalf . This argument was just heard by the Supreme Court in the case of South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc . If the states were to win , they would be able to reach into the pockets of that mom selling her paintings on Etsy , even though she may live on the other side of the country , did n't elect other states ' officials , and never agreed to those states ' tax laws .\nMore tragically for consumers , tax competition among states would also be lost if Quill were overturned . Under the new regime , online consumers\u2014no matter where they shop or what they buy\u2014would lose the ability to shop around for a better tax system . Without the competitive pressure and the fear of losing consumers to lower-tax states , lawmakers would not feel the need to try to rein in their sales tax burden . It 's that pressure , which limits their tax grabbing abilities , that these lawmakers resent and want the Supreme Court to put an end to .\nSome of them probably hope that more revenue would alleviate the need to put their financial house in order . They would be wrong . According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , 33 states faced shortfalls in fiscal 2017 and/or fiscal 2018 , even though revenue collection has been growing in most states . That 's because the more states collect in revenue the more they spend .\nBesides , states are overestimating the revenue they 'd get from the taxes . Internet sales are still a small share of overall sales , and taxing them would n't make much difference . According to a 2017 report by the Government Accountability Office , online sales represent less than 10 percent of retail sales .
