    "content": "Antifa , the far-left militant movement that calls itself `` antifascist , '' has no defined organizational hierarchy or membership process . The collection of autonomous Antifa groups in mostly left-wing cities sees itself as a descendant of the European anti-Nazi movements , and generally agrees that the best way to combat ideas they find odious is not through speech or debate but by direct action and physical confrontation .\nThe first modern Antifa group traces its roots back to Portland , Ore. , in 2007 , and more than a decade later that city has proven a hotbed for many Antifa members ' preferred activities : threatening and violently assaulting journalists , declaring that all police officers should be killed or at least fired , wearing dark clothing and ski masks that sometimes obscure their artificially colored hair , and even engaging in performative clashes with right-wing groups to dull the monotony of typical suburban life .\nAntifa was present during the infamous and deadly August 2017 `` Unite the Right '' rally in Charlottesville , Va . The event saw violent clashes between white supremacists , individuals protesting the removal of a Confederate statue , and left-wing groups . In a haunting moment caught on video , a neo-Nazi drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters , killing one .\nPresident Trump quickly condemned white supremacists , while noting that not everyone protesting the statue removal was necessarily a neo-Nazi or white supremacist . However , his comments were widely misinterpreted as praising white supremacists , galvanizing Antifa and bolstering its momentum .\nFollowing one of many clashes between Antifa and right-wing groups , Trump tweeted last year that \u201c major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an \u2018 ORGANIZATION of TERROR. \u2019 \u201d Nevertheless , Antifa has remained one of the most visible and violent left-wing groups in the United States .\nIn May 2020 , Trump said the U.S. would indeed designate Antifa a `` terrorist organization , '' after a rash of violent protests following the in-custody death of George Floyd . The move gives authorities more tools to track and prosecute criminal members of Antifa .\nIt remained unclear exactly who was behind the escalation of what began as peaceful protests against police over Floyd 's death , with accusations lobbed against both far-left extremists and white nationalists . The president has been forceful in pointing the finger at the former . `` It \u2019 s ANTIFA and the Radical Left . Don \u2019 t lay the blame on others !
