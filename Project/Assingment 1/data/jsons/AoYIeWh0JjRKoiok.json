    "content": "Photographs above and throughout are of attendees at a Better Angels \u201c Red/Blue \u201d workshop held in San Francisco this fall . Back in the 1970s , Kingsley Amis\u2014the grumpy British novelist now remembered mostly as the father of the slightly less grumpy novelist Martin\u2014made a remark that even today holds a high place in the anthologies of human grumpiness : \u201c If there \u2019 s one word that sums up everything that \u2019 s gone wrong since the war , it \u2019 s Workshop. \u201d Amis died in 1995 , so he had the misfortune of living to see the workshop triumph as the primary means of socialization and instruction in American commercial and cultural life . He might have even lived long enough to hear the noun turned into a verb : \u201c We really need to workshop this \u2026 \u201d It might have been what finally killed him . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . Grumpy myself , I share Amis \u2019 s dim view of the workshop as a sly instrument of regimentation , a technique of smiley-faced uniformity , a venue for mandatory \u201c sharing \u201d and ostentatious empathy . For a grump , the workshop \u2019 s ties to group therapy make it immediately suspect . Its implementation in aid to the trendy causes of human-resources departments confirms the worst suspicions . The sight of easels and flip charts and fat Sharpies has the power , for some of us , to induce feelings of deep trauma .\nYet there I was one bright summer Sunday , wreathed in skepticism , gathered with a dozen others in the community room of a suburban public library in Northern Virginia to test whether this nation , or any nation so fragmented and so polarized , can be united and saved by a workshop . This was not just any workshop , of course . I was at a \u201c skills workshop \u201d put on by a grassroots citizens \u2019 group called Better Angels . The group got its start in the shell-shocked weeks right after the 2016 election , and it takes its name from Abraham Lincoln \u2019 s famous plea , in his first inaugural address , that his divided countrymen heed the \u201c better angels of our nature. \u201d ( They didn \u2019 t . ) Paid-up membership in Better Angels stands at a little over 8,000 , but the group creates a commotion bigger than that of organizations many times its size . On any given day somebody somewhere in the United States is hosting an event like the one I attended . There are an average of eight to 10 such events a week . The mission everywhere is the same , explained by the inspirational mottoes on the posters the organizers had hung in the library . \u201c Let \u2019 s depolarize America ! \u201d \u201c Start a conversation , not a fight. \u201d The skills workshop teaches workshoppers how to do this with specially designed techniques for listening and speaking to people whose political views differ from their own . It is just one item on the Angels \u2019 menu of workshops , which also include highly stylized public debates between liberals and conservatives ( called \u201c blues \u201d and \u201c reds \u201d ) , and a relatively new session , \u201c Depolarizing Within , \u201d during which one is taught to turn inward and depolarize oneself , in preparation for depolarizing the rest of us . BA \u2019 s work has been featured on PBS and NPR , both of which strongly approve .\nLots of organizations are in the civility business these days , as irenic activists recoil in horror at the rhetorical violence and deep division that have come to characterize American political disputation . Living Room Conversations , Bridge the Divide , Make America Dinner Again\u2014all have the same goal of calming our heated debate by bringing well-meaning people out of their cultural bubbles , those insular Facebook feeds and message boards and book clubs where people talk only with people who think the way they do and express growing alarm at people who don \u2019 t . The success of the civility movement over the past several years is hard to gauge , though the level of public rancor suggests that it is not really catching on . From one perspective , these organizations seem to have succeeded mostly in forming a new bubble\u2014what activists call \u201c the civil-dialogue space. \u201d Americans are beginning countless dialogues about how important it is to begin a dialogue .\nBetter Angels is different from its counterparts , and more worthy of attention , for at least two reasons . First is the rigorous and ingenious design of the workshops , nearly all of it bearing the imprint of Bill Doherty , a prominent family therapist and professor at the University of Minnesota , and a co-founder of Better Angels . Doherty is what you might call a therapy entrepreneur , creating different counseling programs and marketing them to willing customers\u2014 \u201c educating couples in all stages of stuckness , \u201d as the Doherty Relationship Institute website puts it . Beyond his private practice with families and couples , Doherty specializes in public programs of the kind BA now offers . One of his recent initiatives was the Police and Black Men Project , which brings together cops and African American men \u201c to develop relationships of honesty and trust. \u201d ( Not sure this one \u2019 s catching on either . ) \u201c Bill \u2019 s the one who realized that most of the techniques of family therapy , the tools to resolve intrafamily conflicts , could be used to resolve intrasocial conflicts too , \u201d says David Blankenhorn , the president of Better Angels and another of its co-founders . Doherty \u2019 s workshops are an artful mashup of techniques shared not only by psychotherapy but also by America \u2019 s vast facilitation industry of life coaches , diversity instructors , and leadership counselors . As a business sector , facilitation is too ubiquitous to be a mere \u201c space. \u201d Better Angels deploys role-playing , fishbowl discussions , scripted Q & A sessions , and other exercises that will be familiar to every workshopping citizen . They all have an impeccable American pedigree . In Better Angels , one sees traces of Carl Rogers and Richard Farson \u2019 s Active Listening and Thomas Gordon \u2019 s Parent Effectiveness Training , from the 1960s . Several sessions contain elements that resemble Stephen R. Covey \u2019 s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\u2014a big hit in the \u2019 90s\u2014particularly habits 4 , 5 , and 6 ( \u201c Think Win/Win , \u201d \u201c Seek First to Understand , \u201d and \u201c Synergize \u201d ) . There are also echoes of John Dewey \u2019 s \u201c reflective thinking \u201d and his six steps to group problem-solving . Dewey came up with his program in 1910 . We have been trying to teach one another to be civil for a long time .\nBA \u2019 s second distinction is what the Angels sometimes call the 50-50 rule : At all organizational levels\u2014from the leaders of the local chapters to the paid and volunteer staff members who keep the enterprise going\u2014Better Angels insists on precise parity between reds and blues . Achieving this is not easy . The great weakness of the civil-dialogue space is that it tends to bring liberals into dialogue with other liberals , while conservatives , if they even notice , look on in horror or puzzlement . This is nobody \u2019 s fault , just a matter of taste and self-selection . \u201c That whole \u2018 workshopology \u2019 industry , \u201d as Blankenhorn calls it , \u201c skews blue. \u201d If you don \u2019 t insist on the presence of reds , he says , \u201c it just turns into blue BS very quickly. \u201d I admire the principles behind Better Angels but was dubious about their practicality . Before I attended any BA events , Ciaran O \u2019 Connor , the group \u2019 s chief marketing officer , suggested that I watch a documentary film about one of the first workshops , a weekend-long event held in rural Ohio in April 2017 . The movie was well made and even moving in spots , as a group of 15 stalwart reds and blues depolarized one another and began viewing their opposite numbers with respect and affection . The workshop closed with an appearance by Peter Yarrow of Peter , Paul , and Mary , who led the assembled workshoppers in a hushed rendition of \u201c We Shall Overcome. \u201d Now , there are two kinds of people in the world : those who will join hands and sway gently back and forth while singing \u201c We Shall Overcome \u201d with Peter Yarrow , and Republicans . And indeed , while the 50-50 rule holds within the organization \u2019 s leadership and funding , and while BA \u2019 s \u201c Red/Blue \u201d workshops require attendance to be equally divided , membership is another story . Dues are minimal\u2014 $ 12 a year\u2014and no politicking or propagandizing is allowed . Still , membership is overwhelmingly blue .\nSo the Angels bend over backwards to project an image that is not merely nonpartisan but scrupulously non-left . The standardized material the moderators use in the workshops has been scrubbed of any suggestion of bias , cultural or political . You won \u2019 t find cant about \u201c safe spaces \u201d or \u201c family values. \u201d One moderator not long ago compiled a list of fact-checking sites for his workshoppers that classified sites run by The New York Times and The Washington Post as nonpartisan . \u201c Whoo , boy , \u201d Doherty recalled in an interview . \u201c Can you imagine ? Reds just don \u2019 t think that way about the Times and the Post . We \u2019 d lose every red on the planet. \u201d Doherty chooses his wardrobe carefully before he ventures out to a BA event : no shades of red or blue lest he offer hints of his own political inclinations . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to put anybody off , \u201d he said . In several online bios , however , we learn that Doherty left a Catholic seminary to become a therapist , a community organizer , a college professor , and a Unitarian . We are free to speculate . If reds , suspicious by nature , fancy that Better Angels is a subtle exercise in political indoctrination , they should come see for themselves . The first thing the Angels would have you know is this : They don \u2019 t want to change your mind\u2014they want to change you . If you \u2019 re a crypto-monarchist or an anarcho-capitalist , a neo-Trotskyite or a committed syndicalist\u2014even if you \u2019 re a liberal Democrat or a conservative Republican\u2014the Angels assume an official indifference toward your political beliefs , no matter how idiotic they are . The great enemy of national comity , in their view , isn \u2019 t the conflict of ideas but the mutual contempt with which the contest is waged . Contempt is the ingredient that kills personal relationships more swiftly than any other . Perhaps the same is true of our national politics . \u201c Our job here today is to learn how you maintain , or create , a good relationship with people even though you don \u2019 t agree with them , \u201d one of the moderators said on that sunny Sunday at the library in Northern Virginia . \u201c We \u2019 re not here to learn how to convince each other of some political agenda. \u201d Of the two moderators , I later learned , one was red and one was blue . But at the time I couldn \u2019 t have told you which was which . The attendees were an easier mark . The well-fed fellow with the neck beard wearing the too-tight Ozzy Osbourne T-shirt\u2014definitely a red . The woman with the short gray hair , gingham wraparound skirt , and All Things Considered tote bag\u2014blue , blue , blue .\nI \u2019 m stereotyping , of course . One of the themes of Better Angels is that civil dialogue requires us to concede that many of the stereotypes about our own side contain elements of truth\u2014 \u201c kernels , \u201d in Doherty \u2019 s lingo . The stereotyping exercise that opens BA \u2019 s flagship \u201c Red/Blue \u201d workshop is a good example of the group \u2019 s method . After the participants identify themselves , reds and blues gather in separate groups with a moderator . The dreaded easels , flip charts , and Sharpies are brought into play . The moderator asks each group to list untrue things that the other side believes about them . \u201c What this does , \u201d Doherty says , \u201c is bring up the worst stuff anybody can think of\u2014but it comes from one \u2019 s own side . So it \u2019 s all out in the open , but curated , as it were. \u201d After observing half a dozen BA workshops , I \u2019 m astonished at the lack of variety these exercises elicit , uncoached by the moderator . Reds routinely say blues think of them as racist , homophobic , anti-government . Blues say reds believe they \u2019 re elitist , socialist , unpatriotic . Next , the moderator scribbles as each group volunteers what they see as the truth about themselves : We \u2019 re not socialists , the blues will say ; we just believe that government has a responsibility to help the needy . Far from being heartless , say the reds , we favor capitalism precisely because it lifts people from poverty . Then the groups are encouraged to concede the kernels of truth . While rejecting the charge of elitism , blues might acknowledge that they can often be condescending in argument . Reds might say that blues misconstrue their professions of color blindness as racism\u2014but let \u2019 s face it , there really are some racists lurking on the right side of the political divide . The final step of the exercise is for the two groups to reunite and explain to each other what they \u2019 ve come up with .\nThe response is invariably disarming . Most participants come to believe that they have much more in common than they \u2019 d realized . Blues seem less statist and more pragmatic than reds thought . Reds seem more tolerant and less coldhearted than blues imagined . In a properly curated setting , it seems , all of us are eminently reasonable when we are explaining our own views of what \u2019 s required to make a better world . From attending Better Angels events , I have learned that nearly everyone believes in helping the needy ; no one thinks we should encourage dependency on government . All of us favor taking the long view and condemn shortsightedness . We must live within our means , never encourage bad behavior , and think objectively and rationally rather than subjectively and emotionally . We shall overcome . As long as we don \u2019 t get too specific . When it comes to politics , a Better Angels prospectus says , \u201c we support principles that bring us together rather than divide us. \u201d Whatever those may be . Better Angels is too young and underfunded to have compiled the kind of hard and reliable data that would reveal whether the warm feeling engendered by the \u201c Red/Blue \u201d workshops has a lasting effect . That \u2019 s why BA promotes the skills workshop , to teach people the practical ways in which they can \u201c be the change we want to see for our country. \u201d Our moderator in Northern Virginia told us , \u201c It \u2019 s really just Communications 101 , basic facilitation stuff. \u201d When discussing politics with someone disagreeable\u2014or at least someone you disagree with\u2014avoid bald assertions of fact in favor of \u201c I \u201d statements that begin with \u201c I feel \u2026 \u201d or \u201c What I \u2019 m hearing from you is \u2026 \u201d Don \u2019 t ask loaded gotcha questions . \u201c You just have to remember that people are people , \u201d our moderator continued . \u201c So simple , right ? But sometimes it can be hard . \u201d\nThe notion that our national divide may simply be a matter of ill temper is at once reassuring and depressing\u2014it \u2019 s reassuring to know that the cause seems superficial and remediable , but depressing to think that something so inessential could cause all this unpleasantness . Is it really a matter of temperament , though ? It \u2019 s true\u2014and notable\u2014that contempt is the ingredient that kills personal relationships more swiftly than any other . Eliminating contempt may not be sufficient to save a relationship , but , as marriage research suggests , it is almost certainly necessary . Perhaps the same is true for the nation . And yet Better Angels participants , from my experience , are already well-mannered folk . They are also by nature people who enjoy the workshop atmosphere : the cathartic self-disclosures and debriefs , as well as the moment of reconciliation and uplift on which such encounters are designed to end . It \u2019 s the self-selection problem again . The great question facing BA is whether there are enough such people to change the tone of national politics . Abortion is possibly the most divisive issue of our time . The loudest advocates on both sides are terrible representatives for their cause , Caitlin Flanagan argues . It won \u2019 t take too many , to hear the Angels tell it . Blankenhorn says that 1 percent of the population of any given community , if sufficiently motivated , can influence that community in decisive ways . He points to groups such as the National Rifle Association and the Sierra Club , with membership rolls in the low seven figures . The difference is that Better Angels has no policy agenda to push . \u201c Relationship-building is at the core of who we are , \u201d John Wood Jr. , BA \u2019 s director of media development , says . \u201c We \u2019 re not trying to get people to agree ideologically\u2014except in the sense that we should be able to agree that there are core values that unite us as a people , that run deeper than ideology . \u201d",

Reds might say that blues misconstrue their professions of color blindness as racism\u2014but let\u2019s face it, there really are some racists lurking on the right side of the political divide. The final step of the exercise is for the two groups to reunite and explain to each other what they\u2019ve come up with.\n\nThe response is invariably disarming. Most participants come to believe that they have much more in common than they\u2019d realized. Blues seem less statist and more pragmatic than reds thought. Reds seem more tolerant and less coldhearted than blues imagined. In a properly curated setting, it seems, all of us are eminently reasonable when we are explaining our own views of what\u2019s required to make a better world. From attending Better Angels events, I have learned that nearly everyone believes in helping the needy; no one thinks we should encourage dependency on government. All of us favor taking the long view and condemn shortsightedness. We must live within our means, never encourage bad behavior, and think objectively and rationally rather than subjectively and emotionally. We shall overcome. As long as we don\u2019t get too specific. When it comes to politics, a Better Angels prospectus says, \u201cwe support principles that bring us together rather than divide us.\u201d Whatever those may be. Better Angels is too young and underfunded to have compiled the kind of hard and reliable data that would reveal whether the warm feeling engendered by the \u201cRed/Blue\u201d workshops has a lasting effect. That\u2019s why BA promotes the skills workshop, to teach people the practical ways in which they can \u201cbe the change we want to see for our country.\u201d Our moderator in Northern Virginia told us, \u201cIt\u2019s really just Communications 101, basic facilitation stuff.\u201d When discussing politics with someone disagreeable\u2014or at least someone you disagree with\u2014avoid bald assertions of fact in favor of \u201cI\u201dstatements that begin with \u201cI feel \u2026\u201d or \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from you is \u2026\u201d Don\u2019t ask loaded gotcha questions. \u201cYou just have to remember that people are people,\u201d our moderator continued. \u201cSo simple, right? But sometimes it can be hard.\u201d\n\nThe notion that our national divide may simply be a matter of ill temper is at once reassuring and depressing\u2014it\u2019s reassuring to know that the cause seems superficial and remediable, but depressing to think that something so inessential could cause all this unpleasantness. Is it really a matter of temperament, though? It\u2019s true\u2014and notable\u2014that contempt is the ingredient that kills personal relationships more swiftly than any other. Eliminating contempt may not be sufficient to save a relationship, but, as marriage research suggests, it is almost certainly necessary. Perhaps the same is true for the nation. And yet Better Angels participants, from my experience, are already well-mannered folk. They are also by nature people who enjoy the workshop atmosphere: the cathartic self-disclosures and debriefs, as well as the moment of reconciliation and uplift on which such encounters are designed to end. It\u2019s the self-selection problem again. The great question facing BA is whether there are enough such people to change the tone of national politics. Abortion is possibly the most divisive issue of our time. The loudest advocates on both sides are terrible representatives for their cause, Caitlin Flanagan argues. It won\u2019t take too many, to hear the Angels tell it. Blankenhorn says that 1 percent of the population of any given community, if sufficiently motivated, can influence that community in decisive ways. He points to groups such as the National Rifle Association and the Sierra Club, with membership rolls in the low seven figures. The difference is that Better Angels has no policy agenda to push. \u201cRelationship-building is at the core of who we are,\u201d John Wood Jr., BA\u2019s director of media development, says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get people to agree ideologically\u2014except in the sense that we should be able to agree that there are core values that unite us as a people, that run deeper than ideology.\u201d",
