Soon after the attacks , the authorities said the National Thowheed Jamath ( NTJ ) , a local armed group that has ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL or ISIS ) , was responsible . Police said Zahran Hashim , a `` radical '' Sri Lankan Muslim preacher from the island 's eastern region , had masterminded the bombings .\nThe claim sent shockwaves through Sri Lanka , where a Muslim minority of about 10 percent of the country 's 21.8 million population had largely been living in peace .\nA priest hands out communion bread at a Sunday service in St Sebastian 's Church in Negombo [ Asad Hashim/\u2588\u2588\u2588 ]\nIn Negombo , located 40km ( 25 miles ) north of the capital Colombo , the news instantly got the Muslim community worried , residents told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` [ We were told by Christian friends ] that Muslims , you should n't come here , even to the hospital , '' said Salim Siraj , 37 , a local Muslim community leader , who explained that many Muslims rushed to the hospital or attack site to try to help . `` The Muslims who went to help those people , they were chased back and told not to come . ''\nIn an instant , Siraj said , years of trust and harmony had evaporated .\n`` We had no idea what has happened and who is behind it , but already it was framed that it was done by the Muslim community .

First , unidentified men attacked the town 's numerous Muslim-run businesses , throwing stones through shop windows or leaving pork - forbidden in Islam - outside Muslim butcher shops .\nAbout two weeks later , dozens of Christians rampaged into a Muslim neighbourhood , damaging more than 85 houses and scores of vehicles over the course of an hour and a half , as police enforced a curfew on the city , Muslim community members said .\nIn other towns , Sinhala Buddhist mobs also attacked Muslim communities , resulting in widespread damage and at least one death .\nMuslim-run businesses , such as this butcher 's shop , are common in Negombo but have faced widespread boycotts by Christians since the Easter attacks [ Asad Hashim/\u2588\u2588\u2588 ]\nAs Sri Lanka gears up for a presidential election , in which national security has become a core campaign issue , the tensions in Negombo illustrate growing divisions between religious communities as a result of the April attacks and subsequent retaliations .\nAccording to an International Crisis Group ( ICG ) report , Muslims have been increasingly targeted by arbitrary arrests , attacks and business boycotts .

''\nShortly after , she walked back into the church to find a plastic bag with her belongings in it .\n`` I bent down to get the bag , and on the bench behind me , I looked back and saw lying on the bench a severed head .
