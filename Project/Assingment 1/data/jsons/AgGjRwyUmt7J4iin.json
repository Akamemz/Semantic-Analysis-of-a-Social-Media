    "content": "Three years before the coronavirus pandemic , corrections officers in Texas begged the prison system to prepare for such a disaster . A series of mumps outbreaks had just swept through three lock-ups near the southern border , and the worried staff began complaining to their union reps : the agency wasn \u2019 t answering their questions , they said . They feared bringing the disease back into their communities , worried they lacked training on how to protect themselves and said they couldn \u2019 t get adequate protective gear because they \u2019 d been told the agency couldn \u2019 t afford it .\nUnion officials eventually took their complaints to state lawmakers . Outbreaks continued , and a fews months later legislators made several recommendations , asking the state \u2019 s prison agency to ensure everyone understood appropriate infection control measures and had access to enough personal protective equipment , like high-quality masks and gloves .\nThat was in 2018 .
