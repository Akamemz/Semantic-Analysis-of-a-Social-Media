Douglas argued on Monday at CNN that we should have \u201c celebrate [ d ] American democracy \u201d after the casting of the Electoral College ballots even if some disagreed with the outcome . The Electoral College worked exactly as designed , and produced the correct result , Douglas emphasized :\nBefore Election Day , we all agreed , through our Constitution and laws , to conduct the election according to certain procedures . We administered the election under those procedures . We all knew that to win the presidency , a candidate would need to earn at least 270 Electoral College votes , not the popular vote . Trump did that . The electors cast their ballots consistent with that result . In terms of the process , no one should be upset that this feature of our system worked as it should .\nIndeed . Had we put a popular-vote system in place , then the campaign would have been conducted much differently , about which more in a moment . However , Douglas argues , we should get rid of the system even though it works :\nWe should also abolish the Electoral College . The system is anti-democratic , especially given that the winning candidate received almost 3 million fewer votes than the runner-up . It has outlived its purpose . But it is currently the system we have . And it represents a reasoned judgment that we want the president to enjoy the support of wide geographic areas of our country .\n\u201c Anti-democratic \u201d is an allegation that \u2019 s getting tossed around a lot over the last few weeks , but it \u2019 s hyperbolic at the least , and delegitimizing at worst . Perhaps the Electoral College is \u201c anti-democratic \u201d in a very narrow and literal sense in that it \u2019 s a representative mechanism , but it \u2019 s not opposed to democracy any more than the House or Senate would be \u201c anti-democratic \u201d either . After all , the electors get chosen on the basis of popular votes \u2014 within each state , of course , but still through a democratic process .\nOne of the sillier arguments offered in opposition to the Electoral College came from the New York Times editorial board in that regard :\nToday the college , which allocates electors based on each state \u2019 s representation in Congress , tips the scales in favor of smaller states ; a Wyoming resident \u2019 s vote counts 3.6 times as much as a Californian \u2019 s .\nGuess where else that \u2019 s true ? In Congress , and for the same reason . Each state gets at least one House seat regardless of population , and all states get two Senators so that each state gets equal representation in the upper chamber . That \u2019 s because we are the United States of America , not the United Individuals of America , and we have a representative government based on the limited sovereignty of the individual states .\nThat is the basis for both Congress and the Electoral College , which use the same representative models for electing a president that governs all of them . As I write in my column for The Week , it works well \u2014 and we need to keep it in place :\nUnlike governors , whose state governments have total sovereignty within their borders , the presidency governs over states with their own sovereignty under the Constitution . The role of the presidency is at least somewhat limited to foreign policy and questions that are at least loosely connected to interstate issues and enforcement of other provisions of the Constitution .
