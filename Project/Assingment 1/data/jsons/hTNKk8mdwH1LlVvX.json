    "content": "Savagery is spreading with lightning speed across the United States , with murderous assaults on police officers and civilians and the ecstatic annihilation of businesses and symbols of the state . Welcome to a real civilization-destroying pandemic , one that makes the recent saccharine exhortations to \u201c stay safe \u201d and the deployment of police officers to enforce outdoor mask-wearing seem like decadent bagatelles .\nThis particular form of viral chaos was inevitable , given the failure of Minneapolis \u2019 s leaders to quell the city \u2019 s growing mayhem . The violence began on Tuesday , May 26 , the day after the horrifying arrest and subsequent death of George Floyd . On the night of Thursday , May 28 , Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey ordered the city \u2019 s Third Police Precinct evacuated as the forces of hatred , distinct from legitimate forms of protest , descended upon it for a third day in a row . The building was promptly torched , sending a powerful sign that society would not defend its most fundamental institutions of law and order .\nOn Friday , May 29 , Minnesota governor Tim Walz explained his reluctance to mobilize the National Guard as an unwillingness to seem \u201c oppressive. \u201d Naturally , he apologized for his white privilege\u2014 \u201c I will not patronize you as a white man without living [ your ] lived experiences \u201d \u2014and explained the feral violence as an understandable response to racial injustice : \u201c The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain , of anguish , unheard. \u201d Few arrests were made after five days of rampant crime .\nThe media , visibly exhilarated by this latest explosion of black rage , had its own explanation for the chaos : people were outraged that the officer who had kept his knee on Floyd \u2019 s neck for a sickening eight-plus minutes had not yet been arrested and charged . But when that arrest came , along with murder and manslaughter charges after a lightning-fast investigation by the district attorney , the anarchy continued\u2014not just in Minneapolis but across the country , intensfied by Antifa radicals .\nPolitical leaders elsewhere have been just as reluctant to use the necessary force to quell the violence . New York mayor Bill de Blasio called on police to use a \u201c light touch \u201d in response . New York governor Andrew Cuomo coolly predicted on Sunday , May 31 , during his now absurdly irrelevant daily coronavirus press conference , that the violence would continue . \u201c The explosion we saw last night we \u2019 ll probably see again tonight , \u201d he said\u2014obviously confident in his own physical safety , if not the safety of the rest of the state \u2019 s residents .\nThe attacks on local law enforcement were already happening out of sight of TV cameras before the most photogenic scenes of arson and the stomping of squad cars started showing up on network and cable news . On Tuesday , May 26 , and Wednesday , May 27 , Chicago residents surrounded and threw bottles at Chicago Police Department officers trying to arrest gun suspects . One suspect was the likely perpetrator of a shooting that had just hit a five-year-old girl and two teenage boys . The other had just thrown his gun under a car ; the cop-haters tried to free him from the squad car . No surprise that Saturday night , downtown Chicago was plundered .\nThis pandemic of civil violence is more widespread than anything seen during the Black Lives Matter movement of the Obama years , and it will likely have an even deadlier toll on law enforcement officers than the targeted assassinations we saw from 2014 onward . It \u2019 s worse this time because the country has absorbed another five years of academically inspired racial victimology . From Ta-Nehisi Coates to the New York Times \u2019 s 1619 project , the constant narrative about America \u2019 s endemic white supremacy and its deliberate destruction of the \u201c black body \u201d has been thoroughly injected into the political bloodstream .\nFacts don \u2019 t matter to the academic victimology narrative . Far from destroying the black body , whites are the overwhelming target of interracial violence . Between 2012 and 2015 , blacks committed 85.5 percent of all black-white interracial violent victimizations ( excluding interracial homicide , which is also disproportionately black-on-white ) . That works out to 540,360 felonious assaults on whites . Whites committed 14.4 percent of all interracial violent victimization , or 91,470 felonious assaults on blacks . Blacks are less than 13 percent of the national population .\nIf white mobs were rampaging through black business districts , assaulting passersby and looting stores , we would have heard about it on the national news every night .
