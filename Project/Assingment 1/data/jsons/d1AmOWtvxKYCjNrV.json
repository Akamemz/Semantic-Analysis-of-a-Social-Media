    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Almost two years into Donald Trump 's presidential term he continues to be a polarizing figure among the general populace \u2013 and apparently , he 's just as divisive among the clergy .\nAccording to a new study by LifeWay Research , just a little over half ( 51 percent ) of American pastors approve of the president 's job performance . Among that number 25 percent give hearty approval .\n`` After almost two years of actions and statements from the White House , most pastors likely consider some positive and others negative , '' explained Scott McConnell , executive director of LifeWay Research . `` When asked to evaluate the president 's job performance with no neutral option , most pastors approve . ''\nNot everyone , however , is happy . The LifeWay survey shows 28 percent of pastors are displeased with the president 's performance . Meanwhile , another 20 percent indicate they 're on the fence , despite there being a wealth of data on the commander in chief .\n`` There is no lack of information on what President Trump is doing or how he is doing it , '' noted McConnell , `` so the undecided posture appears to be an unwillingness to identify with either of the political sides that have emerged in American politics . ''\nMcConnell suggests the divide is often linked to a pastor 's political leanings .\nResearchers found that among African-American clergy \u2013 of whom only 6 percent identify as Republican in 2016 -- a whopping 85 percent took a dim view of Trump .\n`` And nothing in President Trump 's first two years has generated approval from African-American pastors beyond that level , '' McConnell said .\nWhite pastors , on the other hand , tended to more split on the matter , with 54 percent approving of the president 's performance .\nThere was also division among age groups , with 41 percent of younger pastors ( 18-44 ) approving of Trump compared to 56 percent of older clergy members ( those over 45 ) .\nAnd while LifeWay researchers noted that pastors ' responses are also split across denominations , they noted that even their perceptions of Trump 's job performance fell along political lines .\n`` In 2016 , pastors in Pentecostal ( 76 percent ) and Baptist ( 67 percent ) churches were most likely to be Republicans , '' LifeWay wrote in a press release . `` Pastors in Presbyterian/Reformed ( 29 percent ) and Methodist ( 25 percent ) churches were least likely to say they 're part of the GOP . ''\n`` With the majority of Protestant pastors identifying as Republican , it is not surprising that a majority approve of President Trump in his first term , '' said McConnell . `` Clearly , pastors ' political views factor in how they evaluate the president 's leadership and accomplishments in the first half of his term .
