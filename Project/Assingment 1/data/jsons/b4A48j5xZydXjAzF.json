And the context of what you had last year was \u2014 you had divided government , \u201d said Rep. Bill Flores , Texas Republican and chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee . \u201c You had a House that was very busy legislatively , and it worked a pretty decent , regular order process . Then you had a Senate , where you had obstructionist Democrats who kept blocking things from coming to the floor . \u201d\nDemocrats , meanwhile , said 2016 is already off to a bad start , with the first major vote in the House coming on a bill to repeal major parts of Obamacare and to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood . President Obama has already vetoed that bill .\n\u201c We \u2019 re off to a bad start when the first bill of the session is a political sound bite \u2014 to repeal , for the 62nd time , the Affordable Care Act , \u201d said Rep. James P. McGovern , Massachusetts Democrat and a member of the House Rules Committee , which helps control what bills reach the floor and what amendments are allowed to be offered .\n\u201c Most of the bills that come through are bills that are going nowhere . They \u2019 re message bills . I understand it ; maybe there is a place for that . But there also needs to be a place for substantive legislation to fix some of the problems , \u201d Mr. McGovern said .\nWith 69 years of data , The Times \u2019 index gives a sense for activity in the modern political era , dating back to just after World War II .\nAccording to the data , the Senate passed a total of 180 bills in 2015 , the fourth-least of all time , and just 36 of its own bills were signed into law , the fifth-worst in the past seven decades . The House passed 361 bills total , the 22nd worst , but just 77 of its own bills were signed into law \u2014 the fifth-worst on record .\nBoth chambers did better at voting , with the Senate \u2019 s 339 recorded floor votes in the top half of all time , and the House \u2019 s 703 total votes topping all but six other years on record . The Senate also spent 1,073 hours in session , and the House spent 804 hours in session \u2014 both about middle of the pack for the past seven decades . The Senate compiled about 9,000 pages in the Congressional Record , which was at the low end , while the House added more than 10,700 , again near the middle of the pack .\nRepublicans hold a 54-46 edge over the Democratic caucus in the Senate \u2014 a reversal from the 55-45 majority Democrats had the previous Congress \u2014 but the reversal did little to break the partisan gridlock that has gummed up the upper chamber for years .\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , disputed The Times \u2019 formula but declined to comment for this article .\nA spokeswoman for Minority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , said the successes the chamber did notch last year happened when Republicans attempted to forge deals instead of working to roll back Mr. Obama \u2019 s agenda .\n\u201c When Republicans are willing to work towards bipartisan compromise instead of caving to the extreme right wing of their party , Democrats are there to work with them . That \u2019 s why the Senate passed a number of bills last session with majority Democratic support , \u201d said Kristen Orthman , the spokeswoman . \u201c We hope that this year , Republicans will work with us to pass bills to help the middle class . If they do , we stand ready to work with them . \u201d\nOne area where Mr. Reid said Mr. McConnell has been particularly deficient is in approving Mr. Obama \u2019 s nominations .\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service , the Senate confirmed the fewest judges of any year dating back to the 1960s .\nSome of the bills Congress did pass and Mr. Obama signed into law were big , and included solutions to problems that have dogged Capitol Hill for years .\nThe Medicare doctor payments bill was one such deal \u2014 changing a payment formula that Congress had patched nearly every year dating back to the beginning of the century . Then-House Speaker John A. Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi struck the deal , which boosted payments permanently , in exchange for future changes such as requiring wealthier seniors to pay more for some Medicare coverage .\nThe education bill was also long overdue and eviscerated much of the 2001 No Child Left Behind education law that had become a political problem for both Democrats and Republicans .\nSome Republicans questioned whether it makes sense to judge Congress on the amount of legislating it does in Washington .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the number of bills introduced is a good metric for how Congress is doing , \u201d said Rep.
