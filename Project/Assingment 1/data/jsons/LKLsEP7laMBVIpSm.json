That has spurred the proliferation of unsanctioned retailers like the one where Rowinski shops , which recently changed its name to Trees Station Medical Dispensary .\nSuch illicit retailers may soon compete with new legal outlets , and many provinces plan initially to limit the number of government-operated or -licensed stores . Medical marijuana , meanwhile , will remain legal only by mail , despite a push by major pharmacy chains to sell it .\nThe cautious approach could restrain legal investment in a market estimated by Statistics Canada at C $ 5.7 billion in 2017 . About a fifth of Canadians between 15 and 64 years old used marijuana , spending an average of C $ 1,200 per person at C $ 7.48 per gram , the agency found . Ninety percent of that money was spent illegally .\nGTV Capital estimates an average pre-tax price of C $ 8.33 upon legalization , already higher than the average illegal price because of testing , packaging and security regulations . That doesn \u2019 t include a planned excise tax of $ 1 per gram or 10 percent , whichever is higher , or sales taxes of 5 to 15 percent .\nIf the price difference allows the black market to compete , that will hamper the public benefits of legalization - legitimate investment , job creation and tax revenue - and complicate efforts to stamp out crime associated with illegal drug trafficking . Statistics Canada , working with police data in a 2014 study , found organized crime involvement in about a third of marijuana production and trafficking .\n\u201c Canada \u2019 s been brave enough to take the step to make cannabis fully legal , but they \u2019 ve also taken the stance that they don \u2019 t want to promote it , \u201d said Steve Ottaway , managing director for investment banking at GMP Securities . \u201c I can appreciate their intent , but at the same time , this is an adult-use market . \u201d\nCanada \u2019 s Senate voted late Thursday to legalize recreational marijuana , but included amendments that still need approval in the House of Commons .
