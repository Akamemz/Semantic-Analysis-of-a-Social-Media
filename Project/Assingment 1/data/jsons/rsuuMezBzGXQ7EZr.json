''\nThe website woes raised questions about the viability and security of the system , and opened the reforms known as Obamacare to fresh attacks by conservative Republicans who seek to dismantle or eliminate them .\nMore bad news emerged Wednesday when the administration announced the website will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year .\nSmall businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as SHOP , but problems with HealthCare.gov have prevented their online enrollment so far .

Employers who choose to provide coverage for their workers may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs .\n`` We expect that making direct enrollment , tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50 % of employee premiums in 2014 , '' Bataille said .\nHowever , the head of the International Franchise Association complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll .\n`` With this delay , it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied , '' said Steve Caldeira , the group 's president and CEO . `` Not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing , cumbersome and time-consuming for employers .
