    "content": "The Florida senator delivered what was easily his best debate performance yet Thursday night , hammering frontrunner Donald Trump repeatedly on his character , his business record , and his claims to being a conservative . It was the performance he needed . The question now is whether it will matter at all .\nFresh off a three-state winning streak , Trump is close to being anointed the Presumptive Nominee by the media . With just days to go before the crucial sting of Super Tuesday primaries , Trump appears to be leading in most if not every state on the verge of a contest . He has the momentum . He has the math on his side .\n\u201c Donald mentioned\u2026 that his position on immigration is what \u2019 s driven this debate , \u201d Rubio said , leaping at his opponent after weeks of trying to play nice . \u201c The truth is , though , a lot of these positions that he \u2019 s now taking are new to him . \u201d\nThe man who has been compared to a robot , a guy unable to ever stray from his talking points , proceeded like the Terminator from there .\n\u201c In 2011 , he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship , \u201d Rubio said . \u201c In 2012 , Donald criticized Mitt Romney , saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation . And so even today , we saw a report ... that Donald , you \u2019 ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled. \u201d Rubio then referenced Trump \u2019 s use of Polish workers to construct Trump Tower , which cost the real estate mogul a major settlement in the early 1980s .\n\u201c My mom was a maid at a hotel , \u201d Rubio continued . \u201c And instead of hiring an American like her , you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead . So I think this is an important issue . And I think we are realizing that it \u2019 s an important issue for the country that \u2019 s been debated for 30 years , but finally needs to be solved once and for all . \u201d\nTrump , squinting and pouting as he stood between Rubio and Ted Cruz , responded with peculiar specifics about hiring practices in Florida .\nTrump continued , \u201c As far as the people I \u2019 ve hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season , like Palm Beach and other locations , you could not get help . It \u2019 s the up season . People didn \u2019 t want to have part-time jobs . They were part-time jobs , very seasonal , 90-day jobs , 120-day jobs , and you couldn \u2019 t get . Everybody agrees with me on that . They were part-time jobs . You needed them , or we just might as well close the doors , because you couldn \u2019 t get help in those hot , hot sections of Florida . \u201d\nTrump , who had yet to really be attacked by Rubio\u2014or , really , anyone else\u2014this way , didn \u2019 t have much of a response when put on the spot . Trump seemed caught off guard by a candidate with whom he \u2019 d enjoyed a kind of d\u00e9tente for some time .\n\u201c If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers , he \u2019 ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it , \u201d Rubio said referring to Trump \u2019 s mythic planned wall at the border .\n\u201c Such a cute sound bite , \u201d Trump responded like he was swatting away his since-departed favorite punching bag , Jeb Bush .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not a sound bite , \u201d Rubio said , sticking to his guns . \u201c It \u2019 s a fact . Again , go online and Google it . Donald Trump , Polish workers . The second thing about the trade war , I don \u2019 t understand , because your clothes and the ties you wear are made in Mexico and in China . You \u2019 ll be starting a trade war against your own clothes and suits . \u201d\nRubio also prepared notes on Trump \u2019 s now defunct Trump University , for which the mogul may end up appearing as a witness in court to defend in the middle of the campaign season .\n\u201c A fake university ! \u201d Rubio , almost surprised at his own success , exclaimed . \u201c There are people who borrow $ 36,000 to go to Trump University and they \u2019 re suing him now . $ 36,000 to go to a university . \u201d\nAs Trump tried to respond , Rubio kept riffing on this same theme .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a fake school , \u201d Rubio said . \u201c And you know what they got , they got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump . That \u2019 s what they got for $ 36,000 . \u201d\nThe old political rule is to attack your enemy \u2019 s strengths . And that \u2019 s exactly what Rubio was doing . Trump has framed himself as a brilliant businessman animated by his concern for the common man , the little guy , the silent majority . He \u2019 s never marketed himself as an orthodox conservative , but that \u2019 s where his opponents have hit him again and again with no result .\nBut Rubio tried something different with his attacks Thursday night . He tried to prove Trump is a huckster , a charlatan who doesn \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s talking about when pressed for specifics , a trust-fund baby looking to rip off hard-working Americans in order to make a dishonest buck . It went to the heart of Trump \u2019 s appeal , and for that reason it just might stick .\nRubio looked and sounded different from how we \u2019 ve ever seen him . But so did Trump . For a man who makes so many facial expressions , he rarely displays any recognizable human emotion , preferring instead to stay aloof and dismissive . Thursday night was different . He was , at turns , deeply frustrated and consumed by abject terror . Things were going very wrong , very quickly\u2014and right before his squinty eyes .\nTrump nervously leaned the full weight of his body onto the lectern and then tapped his fingers furiously at its sides . He leaned his head back to the right and pursed his lips tightly . He looked like a fish .\nWhen Rubio spoke , Trump closed his eyes\u2014as if to will Rubio to disappear from the stage altogether .\n\u201c You \u2019 re the only person on this stage that \u2019 s ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally , \u201d Rubio said , pummeling him on the Polish workers issue .\nTrump let out an exhausted sigh . His head seemed to sink into his shoulder pads . He grabbed the microphone with his left hand and wagged his finger with Rubio with his right . \u201c No , no . I \u2019 m the only one on this stage that \u2019 s hired people , \u201d he threw his arms out , \u201c you haven \u2019 t hired anybody . \u201d\nAs Rubio went on , Trump outstretched his hand at the moderators . \u201c Excuse me , excuse me , excuse me , excuse me , \u201d he pleaded , \u201c he \u2019 s wrong ! \u201d\nRubio wouldn \u2019 t let up and Trump \u2019 s patience grew thin . \u201c Be quiet , \u201d he said while Rubio hammered him , \u201c just be quiet . \u201d\nWhen Trump derided Rubio for not knowing \u201c anything about business , \u201d Rubio retorted , \u201c I don \u2019 t know anything about bankrupting four companies ! \u201d\nThen , Trump started to get desperate . In fact , he started to sound like Ben Carson . \u201c Excuse me ! Hey , Wolf , let me ask you\u2014am I allowed to respond ? \u201d he asked Wolf Blitzer . \u201c You \u2019 ve been responding , \u201d Blitzer said . Trump \u2019 s response was a frustrated gurgle . \u201c No , I haven \u2019 t ! \u201d he said , \u201c I really haven \u2019 t . I haven \u2019 t . \u201d\nTrump tried to attack Rubio for his personal financial troubles , but it didn \u2019 t stick . Rubio countered with mockery . \u201c Here \u2019 s a guy that inherited $ 200 million , \u201d he said . \u201c If he hadn \u2019 t inherited $ 200 million do you know where Donald Trump would be right now ? Selling watches in Manhattan ! \u201d\nAs Rubio grilled him , Trump cried , \u201c No , no , no , no ! No , no , no ! \u201d He threw his hand out , \u201c that is so wrong ! \u201d\nAfter Trump reminded the audience that Rubio had recently been roasted by erstwhile candidate Chris Christie , Rubio pressed Trump for specifics on his health-care plan .
