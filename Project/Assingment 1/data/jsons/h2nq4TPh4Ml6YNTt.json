But we also need to open our eyes and accept the bitter reality we face . We can \u2019 t just pretend the truth is not the truth because we wish it were otherwise . The left \u2019 s dropping of its mask has demonstrated once again the undeniable fact . The left hates you .\nJust give them a listen . Those carefully selected moppet puppets are out there on TV telling Normals \u201c We are going to outlive you. \u201d When leftists tell you that you are going to die first , you should believe they mean it . They have a track record of making that happen .\nAnd then there is the new meme , that the NRA is a \u201c terrorist \u201d organization . This means you are a \u201c terrorist \u201d simply by advocating for your political views . Think about that . Labeling your political opponents as \u201c terrorists \u201d \u2013 gee , that can \u2019 t end badly . Violence against and suppression of terrorists is okay , isn \u2019 t it ? And when this ploy works with guns , it will happen with the next right the left wants to take from us .\nHow \u2019 s that blood on your hands ? Sure , you were thousands of miles away , and your AR-15 \u2013 like the 14,999,999 other AR-15s out there \u2013 never shot up a school , but just believing in the Second Amendment makes you a non-human . Those of us who know something about history know that the people leftists regard as non-human always tend to end up non-living .\nOh , they want to have a conversation , all right . It \u2019 s a conversation about how you are going to be disarmed , disempowered , and at their mercy .\nCrazy talk ? No . Don \u2019 t be gaslighted . They will tell you exactly what they want for you if you give them long enough . The beauty of social media is these creeps just can \u2019 t help themselves ; you just have to have the strength to listen and accept the truth no matter how unpleasant it is . Many of them want you dead \u2013 again , they will tell you outright . Others will be satisfied with you just being serfs , unable to participate in your own governance , obedient , working hard to fuel the liberal redistribution machine that pays off Democrat constituencies . To the fields , flyover drones ! Grow our kale , drive the trucks carrying our cucumber-infused pale ale ! We are to be the silent stagehands in the urban hipster play that is their lives .\nUnderstand that the left doesn \u2019 t hate the NRA . The NRA stuff is a distraction . Leftists are dumb , but they understand the power of the NRA is really the power of millions of Normal Americans coming together to defend their right to protect themselves , their families , their communities and their Constitution . That \u2019 s why they fear it . That \u2019 s why they can \u2019 t abide it . They want your voices silenced .\nAnd the left doesn \u2019 t hate guns either . In fact , the progressives fully intend to be the only group left with any guns . That should turn out great for us .\nAt best , the government that they promise will protect us will make excuses why they can \u2019 t see red flags waving and why they can \u2019 t be expected to actually protect us . Liberals have just come out foursquare in favor of police cowardice ; their argument is you don \u2019 t need guns to protect yourself , and you certainly can \u2019 t expect a Democrat-run law enforcement agency like the Broward Sheriff \u2019 s Office to protect you because that would be scary to the poor government workers . Where does that leave you ? You can \u2019 t protect yourself , and in return , no one from the government will protect you either . That whole outliving talk looks more and more sinister every day .\nAnd at worst ? There are 100 million reasons never to be disarmed and at the mercy of leftists .\nYour life means nothing to them , just as the lost lives in Chicago mean nothing to them . There are several Parklands a month in the Windy City , but the Democrats who run it don \u2019 t care . They know where the bad guys are . They won \u2019 t act . Instead , they feign concern over the children because faking outrage will help them do what they really want done . That \u2019 s why you had them arguing that the idea of a cop actually doing his job was crazy .\nThey want you disarmed and disempowered , not the nuts , not the criminals , not the terrorist , not the illegal aliens . You . Why ?\nAnd they hate that you refuse to give up your only means of protecting yourself and preserving your rights .\nYou understand and accept the truth , which many allegedly on our side refuse to do because the truth is too harsh and painful . America is divided not between groups with differing political views held in good faith , but between Normals and a left that hates us . That \u2019 s not a pleasant notion , but to pretend that this is business as usual , that we are just friends with a slight disagreement , or that there is some reasonable compromise to be had , is delusional .\nAsk them . They hate you . And we must act accordingly .\nThe first step is the political battle .

Yeah , it \u2019 s a hassle . We \u2019 d all like a pause to this constant cold warfare . That is not happening .\nThe second step is the cultural battle .

We need to respond with our own political power , and that means casting off the tired shackles of an ideology that assumes we are in a pure free market scenario . \u201c Free market solutions \u201d don \u2019 t apply where companies instead act based on political ideology when choosing to exercise political power ; how , exactly , do we respond to a company that acts against us but decides it doesn \u2019 t care about the market consequences ?
