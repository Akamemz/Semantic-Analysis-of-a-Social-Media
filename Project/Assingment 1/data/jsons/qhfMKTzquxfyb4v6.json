    "content": "The government could make a lot of money by legalizing marijuana . But it 's probably not as much money as you think .\nThat conclusion is based on a new report by the Tax Foundation . The analysis found that each year a `` mature marijuana industry could generate up to $ 28 billion in tax revenues for federal , state , and local governments , including $ 7 billion in federal revenue : $ 5.5 billion from business taxes and $ 1.5 billion from income and payroll taxes . ''\nWhat if the federal government imposed extra taxes on marijuana sales ? The Tax Foundation found , `` A federal tax of $ 23 per pound of product , similar to the federal tax on tobacco , could generate $ 500 million per year . Alternatively , a 10 percent sales surtax could generate $ 5.3 billion per year , with higher tax rates collecting proportionately more . ''\nSo up to $ 12.3 billion in annual federal revenue , based on the Tax Foundation 's analysis . That 's not bad . But it would only cover a very tiny portion \u2014 less than 1 percent \u2014 of federal spending , which was estimated at $ 3.8 trillion in fiscal year 2015 .\nSimilarly , the $ 28 billion in local , state , and federal tax revenue would cover less than 1 percent of $ 6.4 trillion in all government spending , including local and state spending , in fiscal year 2015 .\nThe Tax Foundation also suggests that tax revenue will fall as more businesses get into the marijuana industry and `` drive down profit margins . '' That would be partially made up by an increase in pot workers ' individual income and payroll taxes , which the Tax Foundation says `` are expected to increase as production expands . ''\nBut ultimately , the group estimates that tax revenues will fall from $ 28 billion to $ 22 billion over time , as long as `` all states implement a 25 percent sales surtax and the federal government has an excise tax similar to that of cigarette [ s ] . ''\nThe tax revenue comes in addition to the other gains from legalization\nThe analysis is making some assumptions \u2014 it 's unclear how cities , states , and the federal government would tax marijuana and whether all jurisdictions really will legalize . But the study still gives a rough approximation of how much tax revenue marijuana legalization could raise \u2014 and it 's just not going to fill big budget holes .\nThe Tax Foundation does n't , however , estimate how much money would be saved from no longer having to enforce current marijuana laws . A 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union estimated marijuana prohibition costs $ 3.6 billion in enforcement each year . But a regulatory system for the pot industry costs some money to operate , too , so it 's likely that some of this $ 3.6 billion would go back to new spending . Still , it does n't add much to the overall figures either way .\nAny tax revenue is , of course , still great ! And it comes in addition to the other gains from legalization : fewer racially disparate arrests and a smaller black market for drugs that criminals can use to fund their violent operations .\nSo do n't expect marijuana to totally solve your state 's budget crisis anytime soon .
