    "content": "The big three networks have been dutifully airing the impeachment hearings since last week , but CBS \u2019 s move on Tuesday to truncate its coverage suggests that some TV executives are rethinking that decision . One can \u2019 t blame them . Watching congressional hacks pore over the back-and-forth of unelected busybodies is boring as hell . To say the impeachment hearings so far have been less than riveting is an understatement . And the viewing numbers bear that out : they are anemic compared to the huge viewership the Nixon impeachment hearings received . According to Business Insider , viewership of Schiff \u2019 s dull partisan exercise can \u2019 t even compete with recent events :\nThough the major broadcast networks known as \u201c The Big Three \u201d and their cable news counterparts all aired the hearings live , they received significantly fewer views than other major recent congressional hearings . In comparison , testimony from former FBI Director James Comey in June 2017 received 19.6 million live TV viewers , and Christine Blasey Ford \u2019 s testimony against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh received 20 million in September 2018 . Even Michael Cohen , Trump \u2019 s former fixer , swung 16 million live TV viewers when he testified in February 2019 .\nThe ultimate reason for the hearings \u2019 lack of pizzazz is that no high crime exists , and hours and hours of probing won \u2019 t yield one .

( Remember when the Dems told us that would result in Trump \u2019 s impeachment ? ) What could be more self-destructively frivolous than impeaching a president not for what he did but for what he considered doing ? It is no wonder that Democrats who think along those flaky lines would call Trump \u2019 s mere tweets impeachable conduct \u2014 what they hysterically call \u201c witness tampering . \u201d\nDems obviously find such language thrilling , but the American people have heard it all before and are tuning it out . None of what has been discussed during the impeachment hearings so far could possibly shock them . It amounts to tsk-tsking the imprudent optics of Donald Trump , which is hardly grounds for impeachment . To hear the hyperventilating of the Democrats , one would think their witnesses were whistleblowers at a concentration camp . In truth , they are just unelected bureaucrats second-guessing the foreign policy of the chief executive . Who cares ? Just look at the wan headlines their testimony has produced : \u201c Aides Say Call \u2018 Political , \u2019 \u2018 Inappropriate. \u2019 \u201d Oh my .\nThat Trump \u2019 s bark is worse than his bite is something the American people came to terms with a long time ago . They don \u2019 t want a president impeached for his personality tics .\nIt is unlikely the American people will even remember the names of Tuesday \u2019 s witnesses by the end of the day \u2014 such was the colorless character of their testimony .
