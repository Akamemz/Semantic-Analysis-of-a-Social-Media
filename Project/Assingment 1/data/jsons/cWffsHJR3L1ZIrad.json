Last year the number of Americans who thought they were protected by the world 's strongest military was 59 percent , but this year that number has dropped to 49 percent \u2013 the lowest figure in the 23 years Gallup has recorded the trend .\nWhile America 's military has been stressed by 13 years of war , experts say the poll results are more an indication of how the public \u2013 influenced by election year rhetoric \u2013 is struggling to come to terms with the enduring threat to the US and what an effective military looks like .\nThe poll results are , in part , `` a reflection of the changing nature of warfare , '' says David Segal , director of the Center for Research on Military Organization at the University of Maryland .\n`` Being the strongest nation militarily does n't count as much given the wars we 're fighting , '' he adds . `` You ca n't field a huge infantry and armor and defeat an insurgency . It 's been a long time since we 've won a war like that . ''\nYet the sight of America 's protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the downsizing across the Armed Forces ( including an ongoing 40,000-troop drawdown from the US Army ) , and persistent condemnation from Republican presidential nominees of the drop in military spending seem to have convinced more of the public that the country 's military is a shadow of its former self .\nIn addition , a decade of fighting in the Middle East under the banner of a `` war on terrorism '' has only seemed to make the terrorist threat more dangerous . International terrorism is the leading threat to the US , according to another Gallup poll this month . The resulting perception is that the American military simply hasn \u2019 t done its job the way it did in previous decades , says Robert Loftis , a professor at Boston University \u2019 s Pardee School of Global Studies and a former official in the US State Department .\n`` This really is about perceptions , '' he adds . `` We 've been used to thinking , 'We 'll send the military in to fix everything , ' and now we 're seeing , 'Well , the military can \u2019 t fix these problems . ' That leads to a perception that the American military isn \u2019 t as strong as it could and should be . ''\nA large proportion of the public are still cleaving to a World War II-era notion of what an effective military looks like , Professor Segal says .\n`` Back when wars were conventional wars fought by military forces representing nation states , we could say that the nation that has the largest , most effective military \u2026 is going to be the strongest nation , '' he adds . `` Now , meeting those criteria does n't necessarily mean you \u2019 re going to win wars . ''\nThat the military that has toiled against insurgencies in the Middle East is effectively being compared to the military that defeated standing armies in World War II is unrealistic , he continues .\n`` One has to ask whether military forces are our most effective weapon against international terrorism , '' he says . `` The fact is they don \u2019 t seem to be .
