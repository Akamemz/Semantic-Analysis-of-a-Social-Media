Despite being a medical professional \u2014 a pediatrician , God help us \u2014 who presumably understands basic facts about human biology and child psychology , Georgulas got it into her apparently deranged head that her son James is really a girl .\nAs The Texan previously reported , the factors that convinced Georgulas that her son is really her daughter include his affinity for the movie \u201c Frozen \u201d and his request to get a \u201c girl toy \u201d from McDonald \u2019 s . She also says he started expressing a wish to dress in girl \u2019 s clothing . But Jeff Younger recently explained in an interview that if James ever had any desire to wear dresses , it \u2019 s only because his mother started putting him in dresses and painting his nails when he was just 3-years-old . He claims that she used several other methods of manipulation , including locking the boy in his room and telling him that \u201c the monsters only eat boys. \u201d Jeff speculates that Georgulas would withhold affection from James if he did not act like a girl .\nThe court case revolved around Jeff \u2019 s efforts to rescue his sons ( James and his twin brother ) from the abuse of this sick and twisted woman . However , the decision was passed down yesterday , and the court ruled against the father . Virtually all control over James and his brother have now been handed to Georgulas . She is free to continue his \u201c social transition \u201d into a girl \u2014 a process already well under way , as he goes by \u201c Luna \u201d and poses as a girl at his mother \u2019 s house and at school . Eventually she can , and presumably will , start James on drugs to chemically castrate him . There is nothing his father can do to stop it , short of \u201c kidnapping \u201d the boy and fleeing the country ( a move that would be not only morally justified , but heroic ) .\nIt should be noted that , according to Jeff , James \u201c violently refuses \u201d to wear girl clothes when he is at his father \u2019 s house . Free from the clutches of his mother , Jeff says , James is relieved to act like a boy , dress like a boy , and play like a boy . The mother claims the opposite , insisting that James is excited to return to his mother and his identity as \u201c Luna. \u201d I think both claims are probably true , in a sense . The poor boy realizes that it pleases his mother for him to be Luna , and so he \u201c wants \u201d to play that role for her sake .\nBut , in any case , the question of how he really identifies is irrelevant . The point is that James is a boy , plain and simple . Whatever confusion he is suffering from \u2014 confusion painstakingly planted in his head by a mother who , in my opinion , should be locked in prison for the rest of her life \u2014 could be alleviated through counseling and therapy . There is precisely zero chance that James is \u201c really \u201d a girl trapped in a boy \u2019 s body , because that concept is nonsensical . James is who he is . And he is a boy .\nIn a morbid coincidence , there are reports today about the mother of a supposedly terminally ill Make-a-Wish kid who is now accused of murdering the 7-year-old daughter she claimed was sick . Investigators believe that the mother has Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy , a mental disorder in which parents invent or create illnesses in their children . I bring this case up because I believe that James Younger is the victim of a new , and increasingly common , kind of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy . His disturbed mother has , in effect , created gender confusion in her child . This case hopefully will not end in murder , but it may well end with the child \u2019 s physical mutilation at the behest of his mother . And considering the very high rate of suicide in the transgender community , it could certainly be argued that she is putting her son \u2019 s life at risk .

We live in a time when many children are having left-wing gender theories shoved down their throats .
