    "content": "David Cole , the American Civil Liberties Union 's national legal director , tells New York Times readers they should n't `` lose faith in the First Amendment . '' Although Cole 's op-ed piece is explicitly directed at `` liberals or progressives , '' it can also be read as an oblique rejoinder to libertarians and conservatives who worry that the ACLU itself has lost faith in the First Amendment .\nThat concern is not new . Back in 1990 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 published a cover story in which Charles Oliver argued that the ACLU 's commitment to freedom of speech had been compromised by its pursuit of progressive causes . `` In recent years , '' he wrote , `` the ACLU has adopted an expansive definition of 'civil liberties ' that dilutes its absolutist commitment to free speech . The ACLU , critics say , is now more committed to goals such as comparable worth , government aid to the homeless , and nuclear disarmament than to defending the First Amendment . '' Oliver noted that critics , including longtime ACLU members such as Nat Hentoff and Alan Dershowitz , were complaining that `` greed and left-wing ideology have corrupted the union , '' which had `` diluted its message , compromised its mission , and , in some instances , abandoned its commitment to the First Amendment . ''\nNearly three decades later , the argument about the ACLU 's support for freedom of speech continues , which tells us two things : The organization is still divided on the question , and the stalwarts are influential enough that the ACLU is still willing to defend the First Amendment rights of people who offend progressives .\nAs Robby Soave noted in June , the latest evidence of internal qualms about free speech is a staff memo revealed by Wendy Kaminer , a former member of the ACLU 's national board , that says the organization 's lawyers , in selecting First Amendment cases , should consider the impact of speech on `` other values advanced by the ACLU , '' such as equality and racial justice . While the memo repeatedly affirms the ACLU 's commitment to defending speakers whose views its members find repugnant , the very idea that the organization 's goals conflict with each other is an inivitation to prioritize some of those `` other values '' over freedom of speech . `` In deciding how to use our limited resources , '' the memo says , `` no civil liberties or civil rights value should automatically be privileged over any other . There is no presumption that the First Amendment trumps all other amendments , or vice versa . ''\nThe assumption that the `` rights '' defended by the ACLU inevitably conflict with each other is not only troubling but incoherent , since the whole point of rights is to avoid conflict by delineating each person 's legally enforceable claims . If one person has a right to spout racist bile , it can not be true that another person has a right to silence him . Yet the memo implies that freedom of speech conflicts with other rights . `` Speech that denigrates [ marginalized ] groups can inflict serious harms , '' it says , `` and is intended to and often will impede progress toward equality . '' It is not hard to see why such loose , compromise-inviting talk bothers critics like Kaminer and former ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser .\nCole 's response to Kaminer reaffirmed `` our commitment to defending speech with which we disagree , '' but it also repeated the memo 's thesis that First Amendment cases can `` pose conflicts between our values . '' In his New York Times piece , Cole argues that the ACLU still takes a viewpoint-neutral approach to First Amendment cases :\nIn just the last year or so , my organization\u2026has invoked the First Amendment to defend high school students disciplined for walking out from school to call for gun control , as well as other students penalized for posting pictures of guns on social media ; a student newspaper denied funding after publishing a satire of `` safe spaces , '' as well as fans of a hip-hop band labeled gang members ; Milo Yiannopoulos and the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , both of whom were denied permission to advertise on the subway by the Washington Metro Authority ; and anti-Trump as well as pro-Trump demonstrators .
