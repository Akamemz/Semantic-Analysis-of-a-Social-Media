    "content": "Donald Trump promised to be a different kind of president . He was a populist fighting on behalf of the \u201c forgotten man , \u201d taking on the GOP establishment , draining the Washington swamp , protecting Medicaid from cuts , vowing to cover everyone with health care and make the government pay for it . He was a pragmatic businessman who was going to make Washington work for you , the little guy , not the ideologues and special interests .\nInstead , Trump has become a pitchman for Paul Ryan and his agenda . He \u2019 s spent the past week fighting for a health care bill he didn \u2019 t campaign on , didn \u2019 t draft , doesn \u2019 t understand , doesn \u2019 t like to talk about , and can \u2019 t defend . Rather than forcing the Republican establishment to come around to his principles , he \u2019 s come around to theirs \u2014 with disastrous results .\nDemocrats don \u2019 t like this bill . Independents don \u2019 t like this bill . Conservatives don \u2019 t like this bill . Moderates don \u2019 t like this bill . All the energy behind the American Health Care Act is coming from inside the GOP congressional establishment \u2014 and now from Trump himself . In a sense , this Matt Drudge tweet says it all :\nThe swamp drains you . \u2014 MATT DRUDGE ( @ DRUDGE ) March 23 , 2017\nSixty days into his presidency , Trump has lashed himself to a Paul Ryan passion project that \u2019 s polling at 56-17 percent against . As political scientist Ryan Enos drolly observed , \u201c in a hyper-partisan political climate , it 's actually an accomplishment to write legislation this unpopular. \u201d Nor is Trump emerging unscathed : Polls show his approval rating falling into the 30s \u2014 and that \u2019 s before he \u2019 s taken away health insurance from a single person .\nThe AHCA breaks Trump \u2019 s promises to his base so fulsomely , so completely , that when told by Tucker Carlson on Fox News \u201c that counties that voted for you , middle-class and working-class counties , would do far less well under the bill , \u201d Trump was reduced to saying , simply : \u201c Oh , I know . \u201d\nDonald Trump has become Paul Ryan with orange hair . How did it happen ?\nIn September , Donald Trump sat down with Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes and told the world he was a different kind of Republican .\n`` Everybody \u2019 s got to be covered , '' he said , referring to his health care plan . `` This is an un-Republican thing for me to say , because a lot of times they say , 'No , no , the lower 25 percent that can \u2019 t afford private . ' But I am going to take care of everybody . I don \u2019 t care if it costs me votes or not . ''\n`` The government \u2019 s gon na pay for it , '' Trump said , and he went on to promise that people on Trumpcare `` can have their doctors , they can have plans , they can have everything . ''\nThis was the Donald Trump who unexpectedly won the Republican primary and then beat the odds to become president . He was a Republican , yes , but a different kind of Republican \u2014 a Republican who owed Ryan nothing , who wasn \u2019 t friends with the Bush clan , who liked construction workers more than he liked Wall Street executives , who wanted the government to give people health care .\nI don \u2019 t mean to whitewash Trump . His populism often edged into xenophobia and bigotry . But it seemed real enough \u2014 even as his campaign policy team churned out standard-issue Republican fare , everything he did and said suggested he had very unusual instincts on some issues , particularly health care . Here was a guy who had praised single-payer in the past and promised to protect Medicare and Medicaid from cuts . Whatever Trumpism was , it sure as hell wasn \u2019 t Ryanism .\nThis is what happens when you don \u2019 t sweat , or even understand , the details\nHow did Ryan persuade Trump to adopt his bill ? The truth is , it doesn \u2019 t appear to have been very hard .\nOn Wednesday , the New Yorker \u2019 s Ryan Lizza published a series of messages from a House Freedom Caucus source laying out the state of play on the American Health Care Act . \u201c Don \u2019 t source to me , \u201d the person wrote , \u201c but R \u2019 s astonish [ ed ] how in over his head Trump is . He seems to neither get the politics nor the policy of this . \u201d\nRecently , I read every public statement Trump made on health care since the unveiling of the AHCA . It was striking how obviously thin Trump \u2019 s knowledge of the issue was . His standard riff veered from complaints about Obamacare to complaints about how Democrats wouldn \u2019 t work with him to vague promises about how great everything would be after the House plan passed . To this day , Trump has never made a substantive case for why this bill would make people \u2019 s lives better .\nPolitico reports that Trump doesn \u2019 t even like talking about health care \u2014 and his staffers have started , amazingly , to see that as a good thing :\nSeveral people with knowledge of the discussions said having Trump on the golf course wasn \u2019 t a bad thing for his team , who could wade more into the nitty-gritty and have \u201c real talk \u201d with the conservatives . They fear that when he meets with legislators or interest groups that he \u2019 ll promise them too much \u2014 or change the terms under discussion altogether . \u201c It \u2019 s easier to negotiate sometimes without Trump , \u201d one adviser said .\nThis is the problem with not knowing or caring much about the details of policy \u2014 it \u2019 s easy to get spun by people who do know and care , and it \u2019 s easy to get trapped in processes that people are building for their benefit rather than yours .
