I put in that category , if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion . I put in that category , explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote , to exercise their franchise . I put in that category institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press . And for me at least I would put in that category , efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else . When they love this country , they are our kids , friends , and classmates , and are now entering into community colleges and in some places serving in our military .\nThis isn \u2019 t just an academic distinction for Obama . He \u2019 s drawing a bright line : If President Trump does any of these things , Obama himself will be compelled to get back into the arena to defend them .\nObama said today ( as he has in the past ) that he \u2019 s planning to take , at very least , a vacation from public life after handing the presidency over to Trump ; `` I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much , \u201d he said at the press conference .\nAnd while he \u2019 s hinted in the past that he might see the need to step back into the arena to defend his legacy , he hasn \u2019 t specified ( certainly not in public ) exactly what would lead him to get back in . Now he has : \u201c systematic discrimination \u201d ; efforts to suppress voting rights ; efforts to silence the press ; and deportation of the immigrants who Obama protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .\nIn large part , this is because there \u2019 s a norm that presidents don \u2019 t go around criticizing their successors ; as George W. Bush said of Obama in 2009 , \u201c he deserves my silence. \u201d Obama , who \u2019 s always been committed to norms of upright behavior in politics , is aware of that .
