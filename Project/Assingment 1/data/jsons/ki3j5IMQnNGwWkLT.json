This article was produced in partnership with The Business Journal , based in Youngstown , Ohio , which is a member of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Local Reporting Network .\nThe state of Ohio has put General Motors on notice that it may be forced to repay more than $ 60 million in public subsidies as a result of the automaker closing its massive assembly plant last year in Lordstown .\nThe state \u2019 s collection effort , initially outlined in a letter to GM in March , has not been previously reported , and the automaker itself has not disclosed the potential liability to shareholders in its corporate filings .\nState officials say the Lordstown shuttering , which made national headlines and drew the ire of President Donald Trump , violated the terms of two state economic development agreements that GM signed more than a decade ago , according to documents obtained by The Business Journal and \u2588\u2588\u2588 through public records requests . In return for tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks , the company had pledged to maintain operations at the Lordstown site until at least 2027 .\n\u201c If the state were to claw back $ 60 million , that would be one of the biggest clawback events in U.S. history , \u201d said Greg LeRoy , executive director of Good Jobs First , a national nonprofit that advocates for accountability in economic development . \u201c This is very significant , very interesting that it would come from a Rust Belt state from a very pro-business administration . \u201d\nThe state Development Services Agency , which oversees economic incentive programs , notified GM in March that it would recommend that the state \u2019 s tax authority terminate the company \u2019 s tax agreements and collect a full refund . Spokesman Todd Walker said the authority would consider the matter at an upcoming meeting , though he declined to specify a date . The authority \u2019 s next session is July 27 , according to its website . Provisions in GM \u2019 s tax agreements allow for state regulators to consider market conditions and whether the company continues to maintain \u201c other operations in the state \u201d before issuing a final determination .\nAnd GM is making its case . In a letter in April , the company urged the state to take into account the collapsing market for small cars \u2014 the hallmark of the Lordstown plant \u2014 and the economic downturn precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic . GM reported net income of $ 294 million for the quarter that ended on March 31 , down from $ 2.1 billion during the same period last year , according to filings .\n\u201c Cash preservation is critically important to General Motors to support a vigorous emergence from the economic and global health crisis , \u201d Troy D.

Last month , Gov . Mike DeWine ordered $ 775 million in budget cuts to plug a yawning hole in this year \u2019 s spending plan , and state officials are already estimating a $ 2.4 billion deficit for the fiscal year that begins July 1 .\nTaking on one of the country \u2019 s largest automakers would represent a shift for a state and region that has relied heavily on economic incentives to attract new employers and to retain its beleaguered manufacturing base . As The Business Journal and \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last month , local governments like Youngstown have offered businesses free land , tax abatements , development grants , low-interest loans and other inducements to spur investment across Ohio \u2019 s Mahoning Valley .\nAn electronics tester works on a Chevrolet Cruze at Jamestown Industries in Youngstown , Ohio , on Nov. 28 , 2018 .

Under the terms of the deal , GM got a 75 % reduction in its income taxes over 15 years \u2014 worth $ 14.2 million \u2014 in exchange for agreeing to add 200 jobs and maintain operations at the site until 2039 . A separate agreement awarded the company an additional $ 46.1 million in tax breaks on the condition that it retain 3,700 employees over 15 years and maintain operations at the site until 2027 .\nBut eight years after signing those pacts , the small car market softened , and GM started to slash jobs at the plant .

Together , the reductions resulted in the loss of more than 2,700 jobs , according to an economic impact report by Cleveland State University .\nIn November 2018 , the automaker announced that it would end production of the Lordstown-built Cruze and place the plant on \u201c unallocated \u201d status , meaning a new product had not been selected for the factory .
