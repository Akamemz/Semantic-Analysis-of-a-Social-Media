    "content": "The Trump White House and the U.S. intelligence community moved closer to open warfare in the wake of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn \u2019 s spectacular downfall \u2014 and the fallout is unnerving key American intelligence partners around the world , according to several high-level national security sources .\nEuropean and Middle Eastern agencies that have information-sharing relationships with the U.S. , already wary of the Trump team \u2019 s perceived closeness to Russian officials , are now watching with increased trepidation as a vicious fight boils over in Washington over intelligence leaks surrounding the Flynn case , current and former officials told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday .\n\u201c Our foreign partners are deeply alarmed and unsettled by what they \u2019 re seeing in Washington , \u201d said one senior Republican national security source , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .\nThe source , who meets regularly with senior foreign intelligence and security officials from several nations , spoke just hours after President Trump escalated the battle Wednesday by doubling down on his accusation \u2014 on Twitter and at a White House press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , that the nation \u2019 s intelligence agencies were behind the classified leaks to certain news organizations out of retaliation against him for defeating Hillary Clinton in the November election .\n\u201c From intelligence , papers are being leaked , things are being leaked , it \u2019 s criminal action , a criminal act , \u201d Mr. Trump said , with Mr. Netanyahu standing nearby . \u201c It \u2019 s been going on for a long time , before me , but now it \u2019 s really going on . People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton . \u201d\nMr. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly argued that it \u2019 s the illegal leaks \u2014 not the content showing Mr. Flynn \u2019 s contacts with Russia \u2019 s ambassador to Washington \u2014 that is the real scandal , in some cases explicitly comparing the leaks to abuse of private information under FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover . Critics says the president and his team are simply trying to deflect attention from the scandal engulfing the administration .\n\u201c I think the leaks are an important issue , but [ focusing on them ] is like shooting the messenger , \u201d Sen. Angus King , a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats , told CNN on Wednesday .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s very , very unfair what \u2019 s happened to Gen. Flynn , the way he was treated , and documents and papers that were illegally , I stress that , illegally leaked , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters .\nHe dispatched a flurry of furious messages on Twitter , asserting that The Washington Post and The New York Times , specifically , are being misled by intelligence community leaks , and outright denying that any improper or illegal communications have ever occurred between Russian officials and Mr. Flynn , or anyone else on the Trump team .\n\u201c This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s losing campaign , \u201d the president tweeted early Wednesday morning , adding the following , confusingly worded addition moments later : \u201c Information is being illegally given to the failing @ nytimes & @ washingtonpost by the intelligence community ( NSA and FBI ? ) .Just like Russia . \u201d\nBut the president has stopped short of naming individuals who he believes are behind leaks relating the conversations between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak . A range of current and former officials are believed to have \u2014 or have had \u2014 access to such information , including FBI Director James B. Comey , former acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates , former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and former CIA Director John O. Brennan , among others .\nMr. Brennan , who retired as CIA director when Mr. Trump took office , was particularly scathing over what he said was the president \u2019 s unfair attacks on the work of the country \u2019 s spies .\n\u201c I think Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia of various actions it has taken in the past number of years is a road that he needs to be very , very careful about moving down , \u201d Mr. Brennan lectured then-President-elect Trump on Fox News Sunday last month . \u201c If he doesn \u2019 t have confidence in the intelligence community , what signal does that send to our partners and allies as well as our adversaries ? \u201d\nWhen Mr. Trump made a visit to CIA headquarters on his first full day as president , Mr. Brennan denounced his remarks , which mixed tributes to the professionalism of the nation \u2019 s intelligence agents with political remarks , attacks on the media and a review of the debate over the size of his Inauguration Day crowd .\nThrough a spokesman , Mr. Brennan called the speech a \u201c despicable display of self-aggrandizement \u201d and that Mr. Trump \u201c should be ashamed of himself . \u201d\nThe fight may now be shifting to Capitol Hill , where debate is raging over how to handle a probe into the White House \u2019 s Russian ties , charges of Russian meddling in the presidential election and the role that intelligence agency leaks played in the controversies .\nKey Republicans , including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , have said the events leading up to Mr. Flynn \u2019 s dismissal should be added to the focus on any such probe . But some Republicans have pushed back , suggesting the true focus of any congressional investigation should center on the issue of classified information leaks .\n\u201c The leak of highly classified information by a number of individuals inside our intelligence community is the illegal act that I think we need to review , \u201d said Rep. Mike Johnson , Louisiana Republican and a member of the House Judiciary Committee .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to find out if we have a problem internally . That could be a serious threat to the country going forward . And these are very serious implications , \u201d he told NPR .\nMr. Johnson added that \u201c it \u2019 s illegal for the CIA , for example , to spy , even incidentally , on Americans unless strict parameters are met . And it just simply doesn \u2019 t appear that that happened in this case . \u201d\nHis comments targeted a deeper fear of an open break between the commander in chief and the foreign and domestic intelligence agencies charged with providing him the unbiased best information on which to make decisions of war and peace .\nEven some key Democrats have acknowledged the damage that current and former American spies can do to undermine a president they do not feel supports them .\n\u201c They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , warned during an early-January interview on MSNBC .\nOne former senior official with close ties the highest echelons of the intelligence community said Mr. Trump \u201c has been hugely foolish \u201d by \u201c systematically , consciously and intentionally insulting everyone who can or should hold him accountable : his party , more broadly the Congress ; reporters and more broadly the [ press ] ; the director of the FBI ; judges , and more broadly the courts ; the CIA , and more broadly the intelligence community . \u201d\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t for a second propose they \u2019 re now out to get him , but there will be less and less benefit of the doubt given as time passes , \u201d the former official said . \u201c And time is passing extraordinarily fast for him and his actions . His flawed judgment and his character flaws are collapsing in on him . \u201d\nThe senior Republican national security source who spoke with The Times said tensions are running high on Capitol Hill over the Flynn affair .\n\u201c We feel like this could be just the tip of the iceberg , and that \u2019 s what \u2019 s making Republicans nervous behind closed doors , \u201d the source said . \u201c In the past 24 hours , I \u2019 ve heard so many Republican operatives saying privately that , if this thing got to the level of high crimes and misdemeanor , there wouldn \u2019 t be a lot of love lost if Trump had to go and be replaced by [ Vice President Mike ] Pence . \u201d\nPaul Pillar , a former CIA official who teaches at Georgetown University , said Wednesday that \u201c we have probably the worst relationship between U.S. intelligence agencies and the White House during the first month of an administration that we \u2019 ve seen in recent memory . \u201d\nThe situation harks of the acrimony that swept Washington in 1969 , when President Nixon arrived with an outspoken grudge against the CIA , dating back , historians say , to Nixon \u2019 s anger that the agency failed to debunk Sen. John F. Kennedy \u2019 s claims of a \u201c missile gap \u201d with the Soviet Union in the 1960 presidential election .\nMr . Pillar said the current circumstances make it \u201c much more difficult for the intelligence community to perform its functional mission of informing the president on U.S. foreign policy . \u201d\nWhile Mr. Trump may have real distrust of the intelligence community , there are also worries and distrust among intelligence officials over the relationships that Russian officials appear to have with high levels of the administration , Mr . Pillar said .\n\u201c To the extent that people are concerned about what information might be compromised to the Russians , that just adds to the problem of the sort of free communications between intelligence officers and senior administration officials , \u201d he said . \u201c Friends and allies with whom for many years we \u2019 ve had good relationships are also worried about that .\n\u201c It is definitely impacting information-sharing with our partners , \u201d added the senior Republican national security source . \u201c Our interlocutors are more nervous to convey their perspective and much more cautious about being candid . They \u2019 ve seized up . \u201d\nStephen Slick , who spent 28 years in the CIA \u2019 s clandestine service and now heads the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin , added that \u201c few outsiders understand the range and significance of relationships U.S. intelligence maintains with foreign counterparts . \u201d\n\u201c These relationships are long-standing and highly resilient , but foreign security partners will be watching closely to learn how sensitive information they may share is being used and protected , and also to confirm that their non-public contributions are appreciated by the chief executive , \u201d said Mr. Slick .\n\u201c The American public and our foreign security partners need to learn the facts regarding leaked claims that Russian intelligence maintained contacts with the president \u2019 s campaign staff , \u201d he said . \u201c Most U.S. security partners harbor a deep and well-founded distrust of the Russian government and its security services . Our intelligence partners will be reassured when the administration conveys a clear-eyed , objective and historically grounded assessment about Russia \u2019 s malign intent toward the U.S. and its allies . \u201d",
