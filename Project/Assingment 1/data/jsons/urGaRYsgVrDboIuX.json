The Senate majority leader , who shattered the remaining shards of goodwill in the upper chamber with his procedural gambit to fast-track the president \u2019 s nominees , didn \u2019 t sound ready to deal on Sunday . In a CBS News interview , Reid would not rule out blowing up the 60-vote threshold for legislation as he has already done for nominations . Reid said : \u201c We \u2019 re not there yet. \u201d To resume the payments to the unemployed , Reid will have to start dealing or get ready for a double-nuclear strike against the minority . The Senate is back in session today , and Reid looks short of 60 votes .\n[ Watch Fox : Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest from Capitol Hill , including a scheduled vote to confirm Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve . ]\nA majority not simple - Reid told Reid told Fox News that he was unwilling to hear Republican pleas to make the welfare benefits part of a larger deal on spending or to offset the outlay with cuts elsewhere . Reid compared the benefits , which lapsed on Dec. 28 , to spending on hurricane relief , etc . \u201c We have never offset emergency spending . That \u2019 s foolish. \u201d The emergency , according to Reid , is that \u201c the rich are getting richer , the poor are getting poorer. \u201d But that \u2019 s not going to get him 60 votes . Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , said he would vote \u201c no , \u201d expressing frustration that Reid is trying to jam the bill through without Republican debate or amendment . \u201c Unfortunately , the Senate appears to be starting the new year just like the old one ended , with the Democratic leader bypassing committee consideration and cutting off all amendments and debate on an important issue. \u201d If the courtly Alexander is not willing to budge , it seems unlikely that there are four more ready to join Reid \u2019 s home-state colleague , Sen. Dean Heller , R-Nev .\n[ \u201c Any discussion on this should be on what reforms can we make\u2026Whether it 's unemployment compensation or food stamps , we should require job training so that if a job becomes available , they 've got their gear ready to get in the game. \u201d \u2014Gov . Scott Walker , R-Wis. , on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union \u201d ]\nOverhead smash or long volley ? - With the battle over appropriations bills underway and the debt ceiling fight just a few weeks away , Reid \u2019 s hope that he could push Republicans on welfare spending without condition looks far-fetched . Democrats would very much like this as a standalone issue . It distracts from ObamaCare \u2019 s ongoing problems and could help vulnerable Democrats in states with struggling economies , particularly Sen. Kay Hagan , D-N.C. , and Sen. Mark Pryor , D-Ark . Plus it gibes with the preferred Democratic talking point for the election year : President Obama \u2019 s quest to reduce the gap between rich and poor . But Republicans , including Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , are saying they \u2019 re open to the idea of reinstating extended benefits , but want tradeoffs . If the GOP has the votes to block Reid \u2019 s initial overhead smash , the unemployment benefits will almost certainly become part of the larger fiscal debate .\n[ Watch Fox : Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry is tracking Democrats \u2019 push on income inequality ahead of the Jan. 28 State of the Union address and how President Obama hopes to turn that into a winning message for his party in 2014 . ]\nTHE $ 100 BILLION GREEN ENERGY CRASH - \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d details how huge government spending on environmentally friendly energy sources turned into a massive bust . \u201c \u2026 [ President Obama ] committed north of a $ 100 billion in loans , grants and tax breaks to Cleantech . But instead of breakthroughs , the sector suffered a string of expensive tax-funded flops . Suddenly Cleantech was a dirty word\u2026Over half a billion dollars went to a solar-panel company named Solyndra to build a factory . When solar was undercut by low prices in China , Solyndra died . Another half billion in loan guarantees went to Fisker , a clean car startup that promised to open a plant in Delaware , but went bankrupt . And in other cases production was ramped up before there was any demand . \u201d\nSPERLING : OBAMACARE SUCCESS IS WHATEVER WE SAY IT IS - Remember the White House estimate that 7 million people would sign up as paying ObamaCare customers by March 31 , thereby preventing disruptions of the overall insurance market ? No ? Neither does President Obama \u2019 s top economic adviser , Gene Sperling . In an appearance on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d Sperling claimed \u201c there \u2019 s no magic number , \u201d adding , \u201c the key is to enroll as many people as we can. \u201d Asked how the administration would measure success , Sperling said : \u201c Success is having an ongoing strong market. \u201d Insurers , however , warn that without millions of new customers , rate shocks and a \u201c death spiral \u201d could follow for holders of existing policies .\n[ California \u2019 s ObamaCare program is again extending the deadline for premium payments .

Mitt Romney , R-Mass. , slammed President Obama for new health insurance regulations , telling \u201c Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace \u201d that 70-year-olds should not have been forced to buy maternity or birth control care . Romney , credited with rescuing Salt Lake City \u2019 s 2002 Winter Olympics expressed concerns about the direction of Vladimir Putin \u2019 s Russia , but the 2012 GOP nominee said he had confidence the country could keep athletes and spectators safe from terror attacks during the upcoming Olympiad. \u201c My guess is the Russians have done a pretty good job , \u201d Romney said .

Haberman gets the goods on the former first lady \u2019 s campaign in waiting , particularly the feud between the super PACs backing the 2016 Democratic frontrunner . Her piece details how the supporters of the former secretary of state solved the conflict between Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA , the Obama-backed PAC that is looking to remain the top Democratic harbor for soft money after Obama is gone . Says Haberman : \u201c Eventually they settled on a solution : Ready for Hillary would focus on collecting and analyzing voter data , accepting donations up to $ 25,000 .

Mary Landrieu , the open seat in West Virginia , the open seat in South Dakota and the North Carolina seat held by Sen. Kay Hagan . Reader Cody Hall a political science student at the University of Georgia , argues that Landrieu , who has been in office since 1997 is overdue for a loss : \u201c Landrieu has never won with more than 2 percent of the vote and I believe her [ ObamaCare ] vote could lead to a 4 or maybe even 5 point loss . \u201d\nKOCH NETWORK KICKING UP MILLIONS IN SUPPORT - An analysis of tax returns and other documents by WaPo found the political network led by billionaires Charles and David Koch financially outpaced other independent conservative groups and even matched those of pro-Democrat labor unions in 2012 .

It\u2019s not for the cash, since Clinton retired her $25 million campaign debt a year ago.\n\nPAC attack - Meanwhile, Maggie Haberman emerges as perhaps the Clintonologist to watch this cycle. Haberman gets the goods on the former first lady\u2019s campaign in waiting, particularly the feud between the super PACs backing the 2016 Democratic frontrunner.

Says Haberman: \u201cEventually they settled on a solution: Ready for Hillary would focus on collecting and analyzing voter data, accepting donations up to $25,000.

Which six are the most likely to flip from blue to red? So far, your consensus remains that Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., is the most vulnerable Democrat seeking re-election. The rest of your super six, in order: The open seat in Montana, the Louisiana seat held by Sen. Mary Landrieu, the open seat in West Virginia, the open seat in South Dakota and the North Carolina seat held by Sen. Kay Hagan. Reader Cody Hall a political science student at the University of Georgia, argues that Landrieu, who has been in office since 1997 is overdue for a loss: \u201cLandrieu has never won with more than 2 percent of the vote and I believe her [ObamaCare] vote could lead to a 4 or maybe even 5 point loss.\u201d\n\nShare your top six picks.
